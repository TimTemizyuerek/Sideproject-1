September 2009 Charles Darwin Symposium:
The year 2009 marks the 200th anniversary of the birth
of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of his
work The Origin of Species. Lesser known is the fact
the 2009 also marks the 170th Anniversary of the nam-
ing of “Port Darwin” by Darwin’s former shipmates on
the 3rd voyage of the Beagle.
Through a combination of meticulous observation and
innovative thinking, Darwin developed an explanation
for the incredible variety of living things: that evolution
is driven by natural selection.
This Symposium will provide an opportunity to appre-
ciate, debate, and even challenge Darwin’s ﬁndings, and
will bring together an exciting range of speakers from
around the globe.
Charles Darwin’s scientiﬁc knowledge and rigour, ac-
quired through human curiosity and ingenuity, have
contributed signiﬁcantly to the advancement of human-
ity.
About the Charles Darwin Symposium:
Charles Darwin Symposia are an initiative of the
Charles Darwin University/Northern Territory Govern-
ment Partnership Agreement and are supported by the
NT Government.
The symposia are designed to encourage lively and in-
formed debate on issues of importance to all Territo-
rians. Through the symposia, the University seeks to
engage with the wider community, inviting members of
the public to participate in the debates, airing diverse
points of view, and seeking to reach understandings on
the issues under scrutiny.4 EvolDir April 1, 2009
The organisers of the symposia invite community lead-
ers, academics and other experts from across the nation
and internationally, to address the topics that are the
focus of each symposia.
Opportunities are provided for the public to comment,
question and critique the experts, as well as present
their own perspectives on the matters at hand.

NextGenerationSeqSymposium
Dear all,
Submissions of abstracts for oral and poster presenta-
tions are now open for the symposium on
“Impact of Next Generation Sequencing on the Study
of Evolution”
which is part of the upcoming Conference of the Society
for Molecular Biology and Evolution in Iowa city, USA
(3-7 June 2009).
DESCRIPTION OF THE SYMPOSIUM: Over the
past years DNA sequencing technology has undergone
massive improvements. The introduction of the so-
called next- and next-next generation sequencing tech-
nologies has ﬁnally allowed to process millions of DNA
sequences in a massive, parallel and miniaturized fash-
ion (for reviews see Shendure J et Ji H, Nat Biotechnol,
26(10):1135-45, 2008 and Mardis ER, Annu Rev Ge-April 1, 2009 EvolDir 5
nomics Hum Genet, 9:387-402, 2008). Not only these
methods represent technological innovations in terms
of increased throughput and reduced costs, but, more
importantly, they are dramatically changing the way of
planning experiments, opening new areas of investiga-
tion. The resulting impact on evolutionary genomics
is enormous: applications range from sequencing of an-
cient genomes to intra-population variability, from eco-
logical diversity to mutational dynamics of cancer cells.
For the innovation, the number and the variety of in-
volved areas, we propose a symposium dedicated to un-
ravel the impact of next-generation sequencing on evo-
lutionary biology. The aim of the symposium will be
twofold: from one side it will disclose the new perspec-
tives oﬀered by these approaches, while from the other
it will face the experimental and computational chal-
lenges of correctly treating the data (including potential
error sources, data handling and validation methods).
Such a symposium will be intersecting and complemen-
tary to other already accepted symposia (e.g. Mutation
accumulation in eukaryotic genomes and Population ge-
nomics, to name two), helping to expand the technolog-
ical and applicative aspects.

EpigeneticsEnvironmentEvolution
Jun3-7
Hello all,This is a renewed invitation for submission of abstracts
for oral and poster presentations for the symposium on
“Epigenetics, Environment, and Evolution (EEE)”
during the annual meeting of the Society for Molecu-
lar Biology and Evolution at Iowa City, IA, USA (June
3-7, 2009).
6 15-minute slots will be available for contributed talks.
Empirical studies on any system pertaining to the
theme of the symposium are particularly encouraged
for submission, so are some reviews with more theoret-
ical components.
The deadline for abstract submission for consideration
as a contributed talk has been changed to April 5th
(all abstracts received after April 5th will be posters),
but the deadline for early registration is still April 1st.
For more general information about the meeting please
go to http://ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/smbe/ . Again, I
would also like to invite all the other evolutionary biol-
ogists to come to this symposium during the SMBE2009
meeting, particularly if you have had enough fun in the
innumerable parties for Darwin this year and just want
some fresh air.
Looking forward to seeing you at Iowa City!
“Epigenetics, Environment, and Evolution (EEE)”
Symposium Description:
Traditionally, the molecular study of evolution has been
focused on DNA sequence variation. This is convenient,
and it is also based on the dogmatic belief that has de-
veloped since the discovery of the double-helix struc-
ture of DNA, which is, any evolutionary change must
be based on mutation at DNA sequence level. This
is a grossly simpliﬁed understanding of biology and a
rather outdated view about life. In the last decade, in-
creasingly more evidences have revealed that epigenetic
changes, i.e., modiﬁcations of nucleotides (e.g., methy-
lation of cytosine) and/or histones (acetylation, methy-
lation, etc.) without any change at DNA sequence
level, particularly under the inﬂuence of the environ-
ment, could dramatically alter important life traits and
such alteration is heritable at least to some degree. In-
creasingly more evidences suggest epigenetic regulation
may have played fundamental, rather than just supple-
mental, roles in development (e.g., cell diﬀerentiation),
adaptation to environment, and diseases (like the oc-
currence of cancer). All these suggest possibly impor-
tant roles played by epigenetics and the environment
in biological evolution. A symposium about the rela-
tionship between epigenetics, environment, and evolu-
tion is due, particularly in this year of Darwin. In this
symposium, the roles played by the environment and
epigenetics in evolution will be addressed with respect6 EvolDir April 1, 2009
to both molecular mechanisms and theoretical implica-
tions. Speciﬁc topics would include: (1) Can epigenetic
changes alter important phenotypic traits? (2) How
can the environment aﬀect a genomes epigenetic state?
(3) Are epigenetic alterations by the environment and
subsequent phenotypic changes inheritable? (4) What
does this mean for evolutionary theory?

Leiden Biogeography Aug13
Symposium: The importance of being small: does size
matter in biogeography? Conveners: Diego Fontaneto,
David Roberts, Juliet Brodie Location: Leiden, The
Netherlands, August 13th 2009 Submission of abstract
for talks or posters is now open: www.biosyst.eu (go to
->scientiﬁc program - >Symposia)
This symposium is based around the hypothesis of
everything-is-everywhere (EisE) amongst small organ-
isms. This hypothesis was proposed at the beginning of
the 20th century for microbial diversity and, about ten
years ago, extended to describe spatial patterns of di-
versity for any organism smaller than 2 mm, under the
simple observation that microscopic organisms such as
protists seem to be cosmopolitan, at least in habitatsthat support their growth. Since its recent resurgence,
this topic became hotly debated, with evidence appar-
ently supporting and denying the hypothesis.
Until very recently the EisE hypothesis was eﬀec-
tively untestable because of the constraints in analyz-
ing microbial communities, especially for those organ-
isms that are unculturable and/or diﬃcult to identify
by conventional (e.g. morphological) methods. Plus,
of course, there is an acute shortage of taxonomic
expertise for many groups. Modern molecular-based
techniques may circumvent many of these problems
and allow signiﬁcantly a higher throughput of samples
thereby increasing the quality and quantity of data.
Such techniques are now being used to inform the de-
bate around microbial biodiversity and biogeography.
The symposium will provide an opportunity to review
how far we have come and in which direction eﬀorts
might best be directed in the future.
Preliminary list of speakers Diego Fontaneto: body size
and biogeography David Bass: Spatial patterns in pro-
tist distribution. David Williams: are there endemic
species in small organisms? Mark Blaxter: spatial pat-
terns in small animals, a morphological and phyloge-
netic approach. Wilhelm Foissner: possible reasons
for protist endemism, with examples from bromeliads
and ﬂoodplains. David Jenkins: underlying biological
mechanisms. Luc De Meester: spatial scales, disper-
sal, and metacommunity dynamics. Joaquin Hortal:
species concepts, theoretical and experimental biogeog-
raphy and ecology.

Portland SSE 2010 CallForSymposia
Jun25-29
The 2010 annual meeting of the Society for the Study
of Evolution will be held from June 25-29, 2010 in Port-
land, Oregon and hosted by Portland State University.
The Council of the Society invites proposals for the
two Society-sponsored symposia to be held in conjunc-
tion with the meeting. Symposium proposals should
include: (1) a synopsis of the symposium theme (about
one page); (2) a tentative list of speakers, including
institutional aﬃliations, and topics; (3) a rationale forthe symposium explaining why this topic and this group
of speakers are particularly appropriate for a Society-
sponsored symposium; and (4) a statement that all po-
tential speakers have been contacted and agree to par-
ticipate in the symposium.
In evaluating symposium proposals, the Council will fa-
vor those proposals whose topics concern newly emerg-
ing ﬁelds, ﬁelds ripe for syntheses, and ﬁelds diﬀerent
from those that have been included in recent Society
symposia. The Council particularly encourages propos-
als that include women, younger investigators and oth-
ers traditionally underrepresented in Society symposia.
The Council will select two proposals for half-day sym-
posia at its meeting in June 2009. All applicants will
be notiﬁed of the Council’s decision in July. The So-
ciety provides partial travel support for organizers and
participants in sponsored symposia. Details are avail-
able on request. To be assured of full consideration,
proposals must be received at the following address by
midnight Eastern Standard Time on May 18, 2009:
Dr. Charles B. Fenster, Executive Vice President The
Society for the Study of Evolution Department of Bi-
ology University of Maryland College Park, Maryland,

Jun17-20
Conference
“Balkans - Hot Spots of Ancient and Present Genetic
Diversity ”
The Balkan Peninsula is a region with a very rich diver-
sity both of plant and animal species. The recent stud-
ies have shown that due to many circumstances, like
geographic situation, evolutionary and climatic factors,
the biological diversity on Balkans is higher than in al-
most any other comparable area in Europe. Therefore,
it is of particular importance to study the diversity and
to share information among the scientists from diﬀerent
countries.
The conference will be organized by the University of
Forestry, Soﬁa, with Bulgarian Botanical Society and
Institute of Zoology of Bulgarian Academy of Science-
sas co-organizers.
The Scientiﬁc Program is organized in Plenary Lec-
tures, Oral Presentations and Poster Sessions. The
main topic of the conference will cover: - Paleobotany
and history - Diversity, diﬀerentiation and phylogeog-
raphy - Endemism - Migration from Balkan refugia -
Introgression
The Conference will be held in Soﬁa, Bulgaria, on June17-20, 2009.

The Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) announces
the 2009 annual Graduate Student Research Awards
competition. The purpose of these awards is to assist
students in the initiation (ﬁrst two years) of their sys-
tematics projects and in the collection of preliminary
data to pursue additional sources of support (e.g., Doc-
toral Dissertation Improvement Grants from the Na-
tional Science Foundation) or to enhance dissertation
research (e.g., by visiting additional ﬁeld collection sites
or museums). Applicants may be from any country,
but must be members of SSB, and are advised to join
the Society as soon as possible to facilitate their appli-
cations (to join go to: http://systbio.org/?q=node/6 ).
Previous awardees may not re-apply, but previous ap-
plicants who were not selected for funding are encour-
aged to re-apply. Awards will range between $1,200 and
$2000 and approximately seven awards will be made.
All application materials must be in electronic format.
Applicants and their recommenders are strongly en-16 EvolDir April 1, 2009
couraged to use pdf format, rather than Word or some
other application, to minimize diﬃculties in ﬁle trans-
fer. We strongly recommend that applicants send all
materials (except letters of reference) in a single pdf
ﬁle. Letters of recommendation should be sent sepa-
rately by the referees in pdf format or in the text of
an e-mail; please include the full name of applicant in
letters of recommendation. Applicants must submit 1.

UIdaho SSE 2009 Activities
Jun12-17
Conference: Evolution 2009 in Moscow, Idaho, is some
90 days away. We know that many of you will bring
families, and that some will take the opportunity to en-
joy some of the glorious back country. Whether you’re
a rafter, a hiker, a ﬁsher, or a biker, you can’t go wrong.
To give you a taste of the options, a bunch of your
colleagues here in Moscow have put together a list of
outdoors things for kids and grownups to do each day
during the meetings, and a rafting trip right after the
meetings. These are events that were created by locals
once they learned about Evolution 2009. You sign up
directly with them, and - ping - you’re done.
The information is posted at: http://sites.google.com/-
site/ ev2009trips/Home
Legal stuﬀ: Because some of us organize the Evolution
meetings at the University of Idaho, I want to spell
out that the activities posted at the attached link are
completely separate from Evolution 2009, and the uni-
versity has no involvement in it whatsoever.

UIdaho SSE UndergradDiversity 2
Undergraduate Diversity at SSE/SSB 2009
For the seventh consecutive year, the Undergraduate
Diversity at SSE/SSB program, funded by the Under-graduate Research and Mentoring in the Biological Sci-
ences (URM) program at NSF, will take place at the
2009 meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution
(SSE) and the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB)
in Moscow, ID. This year we have teamed up with staﬀ
at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NES-
Cent) to send up to 25 undergraduates to the meetings
to present posters and receive mentoring from graduate
students, postdocs and faculty in evolutionary biology.
For full information and links to the application portal
see
http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/edwards/-
community/application.html The deadline for
applications this year is April 1, 2009. However,
proposals will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling
basis, SO IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO APPLY
EARLY. Applications can be made online through a
special portal at the National Evolutionary Synthesis
Center (NESCent) http://www.nescent.org/eog/-
signup evolution09diversity.php . Applications consist
of a title, author line and abstract of the poster to be
presented by the undergraduate; a one-page statement
of academic interests and career goals; and a letter
of recommendation. The personal statement should
address how attending the Evolution meetings will
help meet these goals, and should indicate whether or
not the student plans to attend graduate school, if this
is known. The letter of recommendation, ideally from
the undergraduate’s research advisor, should indicate
how inclusion of the student will increase diversity
of the group participants. All materials required for
application can be found at the NESCent application
portal. Details on selection criteria are available at the
program headquarters at
http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/edwards/-
community/application.html We can only accept
applications from students who are US citizens or
permanent residents. Applications will be accepted
only from students registered or very recently grad-
uated from U.S. institutions, including Puerto Rico
(i.e., no later than having ﬁnished classes during the
winter or spring semesters before the meeting) and
traveling to the meeting from within the US. Students
demonstrating a need for funds to attend SSE/SSB
will be given preference, and will be selected so that as
a group, they will maximize cultural diversity among
undergraduates at the meetings.

“EVOLUTION OF SEX & RECOMBINATION: IN
THEORY & IN PRACTICE”
May 31 - June 3, 2009 at the University of Iowa, Iowa
City, USA
http://ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/sexrec The Roy J.
Carver Center for Comparative Genomics and the De-
partment of Biology at the University of Iowa announce
an international conference on the evolution of sex &
recombination taking place May 31 - June 3, 2009. The
meeting will start on the evening of Sunday, May 31st
with a reception and keynote talk (Graham Bell) and
will conclude at ~1:00 pm on Wednesday, June 3rd.
This conference will immediately precede the 2009 Soci-
ety for Molecular Biology and Evolution annual meet-
ing (SMBE 2009: http://smbe2009.org ), also located
in Iowa City, on June 3-7, 2009. In order to integrate
both meetings, an “overlap day” (June 3rd) will feature
topics of clear interest to both sets of attendees.
The Sex & Recombination meeting was previously
scheduled and fully organized for June 16-19, 2008, but
was suddenly cancelled due to severe ﬂooding in Iowa
City. The organizers are pleased to note that a vast ma-
jority of the previously-scheduled attendees have com-
mitted to attend this meeting on the rescheduled dates.
Talks will be given by invited speakers at both the ju-
nior and senior level. There will also be some opportu-
nities for contributed talks and posters to be given by
conference attendees at all levels of seniority. A number
of travel awards will be provided to deserving students
and postdocs.
The deadline for abstract consideration for contributed
talks and for travel awards will be April 16th, with
decisions announced the following week. All attendees
not selected for a contributed talk will be automatically
slated to present their work as a poster.
Topics will include: Advantages of sexual reproduction
Experimental evolution of sex Estimating recombina-
tion rates Mating types & sex determination Linkage,
selection & population size Sex chromosomes Sex &
pathogenesis Sexual selection Sexual conﬂictSponsorship for this meeting includes generous support
from the American Genetic Association, but we encour-
age additional sponsorship inquiries. A symposium is-
sue to be published in Journal of Heredity is planned.
Check the website for up-to-date information on con-
ﬁrmed speakers, details regarding registration, accom-
modation, etc. We anticipate opening registration
within the next week (by March 23rd). Registration
will be $200 for grad students and postdocs and $300
for faculty. Registration includes the closing banquet
(and keynote: Michael Lynch) to be held on the evening
of June 2nd.

UIowa SMBE2009 AnimalGenomes
Jun3-7
Dear all,
Your are cordially invited to participate in the sympo-
sium on the “Origin and Evolution of animal genomes”
to be held at the upcoming meeting of the Society for
Molecular Biology and Evolution at the University of
Iowa in Iowa City (June 3-7, 2009).
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Multicellular animals
(Metazoa) are relatively late arrivers on the scene of
eukaryotic evolution and diﬀer from other eukaryotes
in their morphological organization, cellular compo-
sition, life cycles, and life styles. These diﬀerences
should ultimately reﬂect information encoded in ani-
mal genomes but should also inﬂuence the evolution
of animal genome architecture. The advent of high-
throughput sequencing technology made it possible to
obtain genomic information for both model and non-
model species of animals and their closest phylogenetic
relatives. Several new animal genomes have been pub-
lished in the last year alone. This symposium will
attempt to provide a synthesis of our current under-
standing of animal genome evolution and its relevance
to organismal evolution in the group. In particular we20 EvolDir April 1, 2009
will focus on genomes of non-bilaterian animals as they
are essential for reconstructing early stages in animal
genome evolution.

BiologicalNetworks Jun3-7
Hello all,
Submission of abstracts for oral and poster presenta-
tions is open for the symposium on
“Biological networks from genes to populations: Appli-
cations & analytical approaches”
which will be held at the Society for Molecular Biology
and Evolution Meetings in Iowa City, IA, USA (June
3-7, 2009). Please see the symposium description be-
low. Empirical studies using network approaches are
complementary to the theme of the symposium and are
particularly encouraged for submission.
The deadline for abstract submission for consideration
as a contributed talk is April 1st (all abstracts received
after April 1st will be posters). If you would like to give
an oral presentation of your work at this symposium,
but have not registered and submitted an abstract yet,
please so within the next week.
For more general information about the meeting, in-
cluding registration and abstract submission, please see
http://ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/smbe/ Looking forward
to seeing you at Iowa City!
“Biological networks from genes to populations: Appli-
cations & analytical approaches” symposium descrip-
tion:
Complex, multi-dimensional processes are characteris-
tic of all levels of biological organization, from the di-
versiﬁcation of gene families to the co-regulation of gene
expression to the ﬂow of genes among natural popula-
tions. A powerful tool for investigating these complex
systems is to represent them in the form of networks
(or graphs) describing both direct (pair-wise) and indi-
rect (higher-order) interactions among variables. This
symposium will cover active areas of evolutionary re-
search focusing on the development of new methods to
estimate realistically complex networks, the formal de-
scription of these networks, and models of network for-
mation and function. The symposium will accommo-
date talks ranging from the theoretical to the empirical
on any organism. Participants will be prompted to dis-
cuss and exchange ideas about “network thinking” itsimportance as an organizing principle in evolutionary
biology. Network thinking is both an analysis tool and
way to visualize complex biological data empirically.
Networks can be broadly applied to nearly all levels of
evolutionary biology from gene regulation networks to
population and community structure. This symposium
will complement another symposium “The evolution of
networks” as it will demonstrate the breadth of network
application across multiple biological levels and discuss
analytical approaches.

Primate Functional & Comparative Genomics Sympo-
sium Description: The amount of primate sequence
data being produced each year has grown exponentially
since the publication of the human genome. Are we
any closer to pinpointing the genetic basis for uniquely
human traits? This symposium will present current re-
search that uses comparative and functional genomics
to explore the genetic diﬀerences between humans and
nonhuman primates (as well as between primates and
other mammals) that underlie species-speciﬁc pheno-
types. Talks included will use a combination of compu-
tational and experimental approaches to examine the
origin and functional impact of species-speciﬁc changes
in the genome and transcriptome. Development and use
of innovative statistical methods and appropriate mod-
els for the analyses of high throughput genetic data are
also welcome.

EukaryoticMutAccumulation Jun3-7Dear all,
Submissions of abstracts for oral and poster presenta-
tions are now open for the symposium on
“Mutation accumulation in eukaryotic genomes”
to be held at the upcoming meeting of the Society for
Molecular Biology and Evolution at the University of
Iowa in Iowa City (June 3-7, 2009).
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: The accumulation of
harmful mutations is central to many biological ques-
tions of broad interest, from the inheritance and sever-
ity of disease to the importance of preserving genetic
diversity. Answering these questions require that we
acquire a comprehensive understanding of why, how,
and whether harmful mutations accumulate at diﬀerent
rates and in diﬀerent lineages. Recent applications of
high throughput sequencing and gene expression tech-
nologies to the studies of mutation accumulation have
greatly enhanced our understanding of this fundamen-
tal process. This symposium will bring together the
most recent advances from across the spectrum of top-
ics where mutation accumulation matters, from mito-
chondrial disease to the maintenance of sex.

Dear Colleagues,
We invite you to attend the upcoming conference of
the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution and
submit abstracts for the symposium on
INSECT EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS: THE EVO-
LUTION OF DIVERSITY
Symposium Description: By many measures, insectsApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 23
are the most successful of animal taxa. Insects make
up more than half of all named species and inhabit vir-
tually every terrestrial environment. In addition, they
display tremendous morphological, behavioral, and de-
velopmental diversity. Insects have also played a key
role in furthering our understanding of genetics and
evolution. In fact, key insights into the importance
of epigenetic mechanisms, gene shuﬄing, rates of pro-
tein evolution, and variation in gene expression have all
been derived from analyses of insect taxa. This sym-
posium will focus on emerging topics in insect evolu-
tionary genomics. Our goal is to provide a forum in
which investigators share information and discuss ap-
plications, directions, and ideas to ultimately further
our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms under-
lying phenotypic diversity.

SpeciationGenomics Jun3-7
Hi everybody,This is an renewed invitation to participate in a sym-
posium on the origin of species at SMBE 2009 (Iowa
City June 3-7):
“Genomics of Speciation & Recent Divergences”
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: With the recent avail-
ability of full genome sequences in several pairs of
closely related species, we are now at a stage where
a genome-wide picture of species divergence is within
reach. These new data are complemented by theory
on the role of recombination in the divergence pro-
cess and by statistical methods assessing gene ﬂow
during divergence. Recent studies have clearly shown
that speciation history may be complex and that the
genomes of incipient species diverge at strikingly het-
erogeneous rates. Although much of this heterogeneity
may be accounted for by stochasticity of the genetic
drift process, the role of natural selection in promot-
ing or preventing genomic divergence between nascent
species remains highly debated. For example, can ge-
nomic regions experiencing reduced introgression act as
3genomic islands of speciation2, impeding gene ﬂow of
linked regions and thereby increase intergenomic diver-
gence and drive reproductive isolation? In particular,
while genomic co-adaptations developing independently
in each species are believed to select against the transfer
of genetic material from one species into the genomic
background of the other, other forces such as balancing
selection may actually favor introgression. This sym-
posium will present the depth of scholarship and the
variety of evolutionary processes involved in genomic di-
vergence by conveying top researchers actively involved
in studies on a wide range of organisms. We anticipate
that it will be a nice opportunity to bring together ge-
nomicists for a ﬁne-scale description of the heterogene-
ity of divergence across the genome with population
geneticists for more precise, hypothesis-driven studies
on candidate genes.

SymposiumEpigenetics Jun3-7
Hello all,
Submission for abstracts for oral and poster presenta-
tions is open for the symposium on
“Epigenetics, Environment, and Evolution (EEE)”
To be held at the Society for Molecular Biology and
Evolution Meetings in Iowa City, IA, USA (June 3-
7, 2009). Please see the symposium description be-
low. Empirical studies on any system pertaining to the
theme of the symposium are particularly encouraged
for submission.
The deadline for abstract submission for considerationas a contributed talk is April 1st (all abstracts re-
ceived after April 1st will be posters), which hopefully
you have noticed from an early email sent out by the
SMBE2009 organizers. If you would like to give an oral
presentation of your work at this symposium but have
not registered and submitted an abstract yet, hope you
can do so within the next week.
For more general information about the meeting please
seehttp://ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/smbe/ . I would also
like to invite all the other evolutionary biologists to
come to this symposium during the SMBE2009 meet-
ing, particularly if you have had enough fun in the innu-
merable parties for Darwin this year and are wondering
if there are other mechanisms for evolution other than
natural selection.
Looking forward to seeing you at Iowa City!
“Epigenetics, Environment, and Evolution (EEE)”
Symposium Description:
Traditionally, the molecular study of evolution has been
focused on DNA sequence variation. This is convenient,
and it is also based on the dogmatic belief that has de-
veloped since the discovery of the double-helix struc-
ture of DNA, which is, any evolutionary change must
be based on mutation at DNA sequence level. This
is a grossly simpliﬁed understanding of biology and a
rather outdated view about life. In the last decade, in-
creasingly more evidences have revealed that epigenetic
changes, i.e., modiﬁcations of nucleotides (e.g., methy-
lation of cytosine) and/or histones (acetylation, methy-
lation, etc.) without any change at DNA sequence
level, particularly under the inﬂuence of the environ-
ment, could dramatically alter important life traits and
such alteration is heritable at least to some degree. In-
creasingly more evidences suggest epigenetic regulation
may have played fundamental, rather than just supple-
mental, roles in development (e.g., cell diﬀerentiation),
adaptation to environment, and diseases (like the oc-
currence of cancer). All these suggest possibly impor-
tant roles played by epigenetics and the environment
in biological evolution. A symposium about the rela-
tionship between epigenetics, environment, and evolu-
tion is due, particularly in this year of Darwin. In this
symposium, the roles played by the environment and
epigenetics in evolution will be addressed with respect
to both molecular mechanisms and theoretical implica-
tions. Speciﬁc topics would include: (1) Can epigenetic
changes alter important phenotypic traits? (2) How
can the environment aﬀect a genomes epigenetic state?
(3) Are epigenetic alterations by the environment and
subsequent phenotypic changes inheritable? (4) What
does this mean for evolutionary theory?

symposia.php?action=3Dview&sym ID=3D3 All
of biology consists of networks ’ interactions and con-
nections between agents. A network can be visualised
as a graph, which consists of nodes (or vertices) linked
together by edges (otherwise known as links, connec-
tions or arrows). The nodes represent the agents,
the edges represent their interactions. Two nodes are
joined by an edge if, and only if they interact or have
some kind of relationship. Edges may be bidirectional
(interactions go both ways) or unidirectional (A
inﬂuences B but not the other way round). Networks
and nodes within networks have properties such as
connectivity, transitivity and whether or not they are
scale-free. In a biological context, the likelihood thatan enzyme will be useful in an organism is measured in
terms of what other enzymes, proteins and metabolites
are present in that organism. A bacterial species can
be described in terms of the network of gene sharing
to which it belongs and in relation to other organisms
that share homologous genes. The expression pattern
of a gene in a genome is dependent on the expression
pattern and functions of other genes and indeed the
environment in which the genome is to be found.
Crucially and perhaps of most interest to SMBE,
these networks evolve over time. Organisms can both
lose and duplicate genes, the external and internal
environment changes, gene expression levels change
and indeed new genes can be formed. New organelles
are invented or acquired and old organelles are lost.
In this symposium, we shall address the evolution of
biological networks ’ from metabolic networks to gene
expression networks to gene-sharing networks, to the
interaction between intracellular networks and the
environment. The timing of this symposium is quite
good. The nuts and bolts methods for understanding
evolution at the sequence level are well worked out,
the data from next-generation sequencing is revealing
new metabolic modules that we never knew existed
and network mathematics is being exported to molec-
ular biology. Many students would beneﬁt from a
symposium where the evolutionary context of many
network-based studies is presented.

Teaching Molecular Evolution: Eﬀectively Incorporat-
ing the into Education
Hi everyone,
This is an invitation to participate in a symposium
on Teaching Molecular Evolution at SMBE 2009 (Iowa
City June 3-7):
Moore, manager of the Science & Society Program
at the European Molecular Biology Organization26 EvolDir April 1, 2009
(EMBO), last May called for a stronger infusion of the
molecular aspects of evolution into secondary school
curricula in Europe (Moore 2008). Moore argued that,
of the most fascinating and deﬁnitive examples support-
ing evolution X those made in the past four decades us-
ing gene- sequencing technology and bioinformatics X
are largely absent from European secondary school cur-
ricula. The same certainly can be said for the US, and
the problem is not restricted to secondary education,
but spills into the university curriculum as well.
The stuﬀ is indeed important. If we really want our
students to understand evolution, it is critical that they
understand fundamental ideas about biochemical evo-
lution, molecular clocks, phylogenetics (tree-thinking),
and development (evo-devo). However, an overempha-
sis on analysis of DNA sequences holds the potential to
push organisms themselves into the background (Gee
2008), preventing students from understanding evolu-
tion via insights best gained from studies of compara-
tive morphology or the analysis of fossils in a cladistic
framework.
So, whats the best way to incorporate Molecular Evolu-
tion into our students overall evolutionary biology edu-
cation? This SMBE symposium will explore this ques-
tion by bringing together speakers who teach molecu-
lar evolutionary principles in courses ranging from In-
troductory Biology to specialized courses in Molecu-
lar Evolution. In addition, we will include speakers
who represent molecular evolution education outreach,
authors of textbooks used in Evolution and Molecular
Evolution courses, and evolution education researchers.
Our primary goals will be to identify and explore prob-
lems our students have understanding evolutionary con-
cepts, and how we can best use molecular evolutionary
principles to help them overcome these diﬃculties.

Registration is still available for the 5th Annual Early
Career Scientists Symposium to held at the University
of Michigan on March 14.
The Symposium examines how phylogenies have been
integrated into the ﬁeld of ecology, thus providing an
evolutionary perspective on the origin and maintenance
of ecological communities. The symposium participants
will address a range of questions from across the Tree
of Life. How does the evolutionary history of a species
inﬂuence its interaction with other species? What are
the mechanisms of such inﬂuences and how does eco-
logical context inﬂuence further evolution? What are
the consequences of the feedback between ecology and
evolution for community structure and dynamics? The
symposium will also include an open mike discussion,
poster presentations by graduate students, complimen-
tary lunch and a dinner reception.
Eight outstanding scientists have been selected to
present their work. The speakers include:

*** Please disseminate widely to students at your in-

The Centre for Research and Conservation (CRC) of
the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp (RZSA) is of-
fering a PhD Scholarship in the project:
Mate Choice & patterns of adaptive variation in the
European Black Vulture (Aegypius monachus)
The Black Vulture has an extensive but discontinu-
ous Palearctic distribution extending from the Iberian
Peninsula across southern Europe through the central
Asian Plateau to Mongolia and China. Since the early
1950’s, in response to anthropogenic eﬀects, the wild
European distribution has shown a dramatic decrease
with extirpations from the majority of its European
range. In 1987, in an eﬀort to help conserve and re-
establish populations within Europe, the Black Vulture
Conservation Foundation (BVCF) and the European
Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) established a
European Endangered species Programme (EEP), co-
ordinated by Animal Park Planckendael in Mechelen,
Belgium. Despite successful reintroductions (in Spain
and France), the breeding success of this EEP is rela-
tively low mainly because of lack of hatching success.
It was hypothesised that the low percentage of fertil-
ized/viable eggs may be due to genetic incompatibil-
ity between paired birds, either in terms of genome
wide heterozygosity or speciﬁcally at the Major Histo-
compatibility Complex (MHC) and closely linked Ol-
factory Receptor & Vomeronasal Genes (OR & VR
genes), together called the ’immuno-olfactory super-complex’ (IOS). Although birds have been used exten-
sively for studies of sexual selection and mate choice,
relatively little work has focused on the role of the IOS.
Those studies that have taken place have usually been
on passerine or fowl species. As such, data from this
study will form a unique contribution to IOS research
in raptor populations. Furthermore, we will integrate
the analysis of semiochemicals with the genetic analy-
sis as the odourant proﬁles might represent condition-
dependent signals that reﬂect not only variation at the
IOS genes but an individual’s overall genetic variation.
To test/strengthen the hypothesis that these signals are
condition-dependent, we will compare the data against
traditional parameters including: body measurements
and parasite loads (ectoparasites and blood parasites)
to estimate condition. Hence the project will encom-
pass multidisciplinary aspects involved in breeding suc-
cess including the genetic basis (MHC), the molecules
involved (semiochemicals), their receptor genes (OR &
VR), to the eﬀect on the condition of the organism in-
volved (parasitic load, hatching/breeding success and
survival) and the eﬀect on conspeciﬁcs (mate choice and
pair bonding).
If IOS proﬁle is an important component of mate choice
in this species, then IOS screening will be excellent tool
for informing the movement of individuals among insti-
tutions and the assignment of pairs within the captive
breeding program, and as such is in keeping with the
aims and objectives of the European Action Plan for
this species. Investigation of IOS variation in the frag-
mented wild populations will also be used to inform the
setting of conservation management units in the ﬁeld.
The structure observed at the genes under selection will
inﬂuence decisions on translocations (e.g. the avoidance
of braking up co-adapted gene complexes).
The broad aims of the project are to a) evaluate the
pedigree and breeding success using studbook data as
well as molecular (microsatellite DNA) data, b) useApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 29
captive individuals from among the European Zoo EEP
collection, as well as samples from wild/released popu-
lations within Europe, to assess the role of IOS geno-
type in female mate choice, c) to compare genetic data
with existing observational data from behavioural stud-
ies, and d) to contrast IOS variation against existing
(and new) mtDNA and microsatellite data to detect
signatures of adaptive variation.

NERC-funded PhD studentship at University of Bath:
Evolutionary genetics of breeding systems in shorebird
populations
Supervisors: Prof Tam´ as Sz´ ekely (Bath), Dr Patricia
Lee (Swansea), Dr Steve Dorus (Bath) & Prof Terry
Burke (Sheﬃeld)
Mating systems, pair bonds and parental care are
highly variable traits within and between shorebirdpopulations. The Biodiversity lab at the University of
Bath is carrying out a series of studies to reveal the se-
lective processes that has shaped breeding system varia-
tion. Two fundamental issues, however, have remained
elusive: (i) what is the role of local adaptation driving
breeding system variation? (ii) are these adaptations
related to genes and genomes?
The objective of the NERC-funded studentship is to
develop, test and use molecular markers (SNPs and
microsatellites) to measure population diﬀerentiation.
The project has a ﬁeld component given that the Biodi-
versity Lab works with a range of species in exotic loca-
tions. However, the emphasis of the project is on evolu-
tionary and molecular approaches. We anticipate that
the markers will be useful for establishing population-
level diﬀerentiation between breeding populations, and
estimating migratory routes. This will provide the link
between migratory strategies and breeding system vari-
ation for genetically diﬀerentiated populations. Estab-
lishing the connection between breeding and migrating
shorebirds may also impact upon conservation strate-
gies for managing shorebird populations.
This project will suit a student with strong interest
in molecular ecology, conservation genetics and be-
havioural ecology. The ideal candidate should have
good general laboratory skills with understanding of
DNA sequencing, and statistical analyses of mitochon-
drial and/or nuclear sequence data.
There is a signiﬁcant ﬁeld component in the project,
and we expect the student will spend substantial time
sampling shorebird populations in Europe, Asia and
Africa, often working in hostile environments (Arctic,
tropics). The student will be trained in ﬁeld biology,
molecular ecology, behavioural ecology and statistical
analyses.

BacteriaPhageCoevolution
Applications are invited for a NERC PhD studentship
to start October 2009 under the supervision of Dr Ivana
Gudelj in the Department of Mathematics, Imperial
College London.
Title: Mathematical modeling of bacteria-phage co-
evolution
Project outline: In the year that sees the bicentenary
of Darwins birth and 150th anniversary of the publica-
tion of his seminal work The origin of species, a success-
ful candidate will have an exciting opportunity to join
a team of mathematicians and experimental biologists
working on fundamental question in evolutionary ecol-
ogy. For example, how can we account for both within
and between species diversity? Why do ecosystems dif-
fer in the number of species they contain? The project
will approach these problems by using mathematics and
laboratory mini-ecosystems containing E.coli bacteria
and their viral parasites phages.
It is widely acknowledged that much of the genetic and32 EvolDir April 1, 2009
phenotypic polymorphism in nature is generated and
maintained by co-evolutionary interactions. Bacteria
and phages have not only proven to be an extremely
useful model system for studying co-evolutionary di-
versiﬁcation but also understanding the impact viruses
have on bacterial evolution is an important problem in
its own right. The student will work on the develop-
ment and analysis of mathematical models of bacteria-
phage co-evolution that combine systems biology with
population biology. The models will be parameterized,
tested and revised in collaboration with the experimen-
tal lab of Dr Samantha Forde, Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology Department, University of California at
Santa Cruz.
The studentship will be full-time for three years at the
standard NERC rate. Candidates should have a ﬁrst or
a good upper second class honours degree in mathemat-
ics or a related theoretical discipline. Applicants with a
relevant MSc such as applied mathematics, mathemat-
ical biology or theoretical biology would be welcome.
The position is open to UK citizens and EU citizens
with an appropriate qualiﬁcation who have been resi-
dent or studied in the UK for three years. For an infor-
mal discussion of the project please contact: Dr Ivana
Gudelj, i.gudelj@imperial.ac.uk.
Applicants should send a CV, including a brief personal
statement as well as contact details of two academic ref-
erees, either electronically to r.svanidze@imperial.ac.uk
or by post to Rusudan Svanidze, Department of Math-
ematics, Imperial College London, 180 Queens Gate,

Project Title: The evolutionary responses of complex
ecosystems: simulated responses of ecosystems to envi-
ronmental perturbation (3 years)
Project Summary: Predicting the outcome of cur-
rent environmental change scenarios is hampered by
the lack of theoretical understanding of how ecologicaland evolutionary dynamics interact in complex ecosys-
tems. Previous models have explored such questions,
but these have suﬀered from simplistic or biologically
unrealistic assumptions about the underlying ecologi-
cal and evolutionary mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, this project will use meta-analyses of a)
lab and ﬁeld evolution experiments, b) ecophysiological
data and c) food web data on the trophic interactions
among component species within ecosystems to develop
simulation models of ecosystems that fall within biolog-
ically realistic ranges of key parameters (such as evolv-
ability, connectivity, species abundances etc). Simula-
tions will then be run on high performance computer
facilities to explore the interaction between ecological
dynamics (changes in species abundances and distribu-
tion) and evolutionary dynamics (genetic adaptation
to changes) under diﬀerent scenarios of environmental
change. The key aim will be to estimate the likely con-
tribution of evolutionary and ecological change to the
responses of ecosystems to diﬀerent aspects of environ-
mental change. How resilient are systems in terms of
their ability to adapt to new environmental conditions?
Training and expertise: the student will receive training
in evolutionary and ecological theory, computer mod-
elling, database assembly, statistical analysis, and the
mathematical biology of complex systems. You will join
a lively group at Silwood Park campus working at the
interface between evolutionary biology and ecology, and
on the application of these topics to climate change re-
search.

The chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
(Bd), is causing global declines in amphibian biodiver-
sity. The PhD project will explore the emergence of
this pathogen across Europe by developing new molec-
ular epidemiological techniques to genotype lineages of
the pathogen for the following tasks:
1. Collecting and identifying Bd isolates from across
Europe with increased / attenuated virulence
2. Using high-throughput genome sequencing to iden-

of the pathogen
3. Using phylogenetics to identify the number of times
that Bd has been introduced into Europe and identify-
ing the principle vectors
This studentship is tied to the new European project
’RACE: Risk Assessment of Chytridiomycosis to Eu-

Project title: Allelic variation and protein function in
a plant community context
Project description: This interdisciplinary project rep-
resents a collaboration between the Section of Plant
Ecology and Systematics, and the Section of Microbial
Ecology within the Department of Ecology, Lund Uni-
versity.
The project will focus on genomic ecology and commu-nity genomics and will develop a novel system for the
study of gene variation and function in the context of
natural plant communities. Molecular diﬀerentiation
will be investigated at a pair of loci coding for a key
metabolic enzyme, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), in
the wild plant Festuca ovina, and the distribution and
function of individual PGI alleles will be explored in
natural populations within grassland plant communi-
ties on the Baltic island of Uland. The project will
involve characterization of sequence diﬀerentiation be-
tween the multiple alleles at the two loci and the de-
velopment of allele-speciﬁc primers. Relationships be-
tween individual alleles and ﬁne-scale niche-variation
within natural grassland communities will be investi-
gated and the functional consequences of the allelic
variation will be inferred through analyses of predicted
protein structures.
The PhD project will be linked to the Research School
in Genomic Ecology within the Centre for Genomic
Ecology (CGE). Genomic ecology represents a new in-
terdisciplinary ﬁeld on the interface between ecology,
evolutionary and molecular biology, and genomics. The
long-term goal of CGE is to achieve an integrated un-
derstanding of the molecular, evolutionary and ecolog-
ical mechanisms and processes that are involved in the
generation of the immense diversity of form and func-
tion that characterizes living organisms. The Research
School in Genomic Ecology will provide the PhD stu-
dent with access to advanced courses and opportuni-
ties for placements in other laboratories as well as a
stimulating social network. Further information about
CGE and the research school can be found at http:/-
/www.ekol.lu.se/research/genomic-ecology . Qualiﬁca-
tions: Applicants should have a Master’s degree (or
equivalent) in biology, with specialization in botany,
plant ecology, plant genetics, molecular ecology, molec-
ular genetics, or a similar subject area. Experience with
molecular techniques is a central requirement for the
position. Competence with univariate and multivariate
statistics, bioinformatics and plant cultivation is also a
desirable merit. A very good knowledge of written and
spoken English is required. A valid driving licence is
also a desirable merit.
Additional information: A Swedish PhD represents four
years of full-time study. Of these four years, three years
are devoted to research activities and one year is de-
voted to advanced course work, in which course points
are obtained via attendance at research-level courses
given in Lund or elsewhere in Europe.

NewZealand StickInsectGenomics
Genomics of cold tolerance adaptations in New Zealand
alpine stick insects
The Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and
Evolution and Landcare Research has funding for a
Ph.D. position in genome evolution of stick insects.
The Ph.D. student will be supervised by Thomas Buck-
ley at Landcare Research, Auckland and will be en-
rolled at the University of Auckland. They will receive
training in genomics, entomology, bioinformatics, pop-
ulation genetics and phylogenetics. The student will
be co-supervised by Richard Newcomb (University of
Auckland) and Allen Rodrigo (Bioinformatics Institute,
University of Auckland). The successful candidate will
receive a scholarship of $25,000 per year for three years
and $5,000 per year for fees.
The New Zealand stick insect genus Micrarchus con-
tains several species of which one is restricted to the
high alpine zone of the South Island. Other species
are restricted to the lowlands of the North and South
Islands. This project will involve gathering transcrip-
tome data from alpine and lowland Micrarchus species
via pyrosequencing to identify candidate loci involved
in cold tolerance. The function of these loci will then
be assessed using quantitative PCR. Genetic variation
at loci showing a clear association with cold tolerance
will be measured within and between species. The his-
torical phylogenetic pattern will be reconstructed using
markers isolated from the transcriptome data. Patterns
of gene ﬂow between the alpine and lowland species at
cold tolerance loci and background loci will be com-
pared.
For enquiries please contact Thomas Buckley at the

Norwich UK PlantGeneticDiversity
Ph.D. studentship at the John Innes Centre and the
University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK
The role of genetic diversity in securing food pro-
duction http://www.jic.ac.uk/STUDENTS/search/-
details.asp?id=3D769 The research concerns the
possibility of exploiting genetic diversity to secure
long-term food supplies. In ﬁeld trials, crops with high
levels of genetic diversity have similar mean yields to
those of pure varieties but their yields are more stable
across diﬀerent environments. Genetically diverse
crops could therefore have a crucial role in maintaining
a stable food supply in future despite unpredictable
variation in the climate and reduced ability to rely on
chemical inputs derived ultimately from fossil fuel.
The aim of the studentship is to test if, in a genet-
ically diverse population, competition between plants
within local patches in a ﬁeld maintains the average
yield (seed production) despite the environment being
variable or even unpredictable. The experiments will
use Arabidopsis as a model organism because it allows
experiments to be done with greater replication and
more precise control of the environment than is possi-
ble with any arable crop plant.
The student will be supervised by James Brown at the
John Innes Centre and Tove Jørgensen at the Univer-
sity of East Anglia. See http://www.jic.ac.uk/staﬀ/-

UEdinburgh PlantTaxonomy
MSc Degree/Postgraduate Diploma in the Biodiversity
and Taxonomy of Plants
Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh/ University of Ed-inburgh
Programme Philosophy The MSc in Biodiversity and
Taxonomy of Plants was established by the University
of Edinburgh and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
(RBGE) to address the growing worldwide demand for
trained plant taxonomists and whole-plant scientists.
A detailed knowledge of plants and habitats is funda-
mental to their eﬀective conservation. To communicate
such knowledge accurately and eﬀectively, training is
required in plant taxonomy ’ the discipline devoted to
plant diversity and evolution, relationships, and nomen-
clature. The MSc is perfect for those wishing to develop
a career in many areas of plant science: n Survey and
conservation work in threatened ecosystems n Assess-
ment of plant resources and genetic diversity n Taxo-
nomic research n Management of institutes and cura-
tion of collections n A stepping stone to PhD research
and academic careers
Edinburgh is a unique place to study plant taxonomy
and diversity. The programme and students beneﬁt
widely from a close partnership between RBGE and the
University of Edinburgh (UoE). RBGE has one of the
world1s best living collections (15,000 species across our
four specialist gardens ’ 5% of world species), an herbar-
ium of three million specimens and one of the UK1s
most comprehensive botanical libraries. The School of
Biological Sciences at UoE is a centre of excellence for
research in Plant Sciences and Evolutionary Biology.
Recognised experts from RBGE, UoE, and from diﬀer-
ent institutions in the UK deliver lectures across the
whole spectrum of plant diversity. Most course work
is based at RBGE, close to major collections of plants,
but students have full access to the extensive learning
facilities of the university.
Aims and Scope The MSc provides biologists, conser-
vationists, horticulturists and ecologists with a wide
knowledge of plant biodiversity, as well as a thorough
understanding of traditional and modern approaches to
pure and applied taxonomy. Apart from learning about
the latest research techniques for classiﬁcation, students
should acquire a broad knowledge of plant structure,
ecology, and identiﬁcation.
Programme Structure This is an intensive twelve-month
programme and involves lectures, practicals, workshops
and essay writing, with examinations at the end of the
ﬁrst and second semesters. Topics covered include: n
Functions and philosophy of taxonomy n Evolution and
biodiversity of the major plant groups, fungi and lichens
n Plant geography n Ecology of plants and ecosystems n
Conservation and sustainability n Production and use
of ﬂoras and monographs n Biodiversity databases n
Phylogenetic analysis n Population and conservationApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 39
genetics n Tropical ﬁeld course, plant collecting and
ecology n Curation of living collections, herbaria and li-
braries n Plant morphology, anatomy and development
n Molecular systematics
Fieldwork and visits to other institutes are an integral
part of the course. There is a two-week ﬁeld course
to Belize in which students are taught ﬁeld collection
and identiﬁcation of tropical plants ecological survey
techniques. The summer is devoted to four months
of a major scientiﬁc research project of the student1s
choice or a topic proposed by a supervisor. These re-
search projects link in directly with active research pro-
grammes at RBGE.
Entry Requirements Applicants should ideally hold a
university degree, or its equivalent, in a biological, hor-
ticultural, or environmental science, and above all have
a genuine interest in plants. Relevant work experience
is desirable but not required. Evidence of proﬁciency in
English must be provided if this is not an applicant1s
ﬁrst language.
Funding The course is currently supported by eight
Natural Environment Research Council studentships
that are open to EU students only (see http://-
www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/ ). Other international fund-
ing bodies have supported overseas students in the past.

Geographic variation and the evolution of maternal ef-
fects
Primary supervisor: Professor Allen J. Moore
Deadline for applications: 27 March 2009
This project is part-ﬁnanced by the European Union,
European Social Fund
Maternal eﬀects, where mothers inﬂuence oﬀspring
traits via maternally-inﬂuenced environments, are a
common source of variation in life history traits. Mater-
nal eﬀects are expected to have evolved as adaptations
however little work has examined how maternal eﬀects
evolve. In this study you will compare maternal eﬀects
in tropical and temperate populations of the large milk-
weed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, to determine the scope
for maternal eﬀects to evolve in response to environ-
mental stress or change. Although maternal eﬀects pro-
vide a source of environmental variation for oﬀspring,
diﬀerences among mothers in their eﬀects can be genetic
and therefore evolve. In addition to examining diﬀer-
ences in the extent, timing and importance of maternal
eﬀects among populations, genetic variation underlying
maternal eﬀects in diﬀerent populations will be com-
pared. [ http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/

Geographic variation and evolved responses to food
stress
Primary supervisor: Dr Patricia J. Moore
Deadline for applications: 27 March 2009
This project is part-ﬁnanced by the European Union,
European Social Fund
One way in which insects respond to food stress is to
resorb oocytes and re-invest that energy into somatic
maintenance. Oosorption can occur through apopto-
sis, programmed cell death of the oocytes. The large
milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, has a broad ge-
ographic distribution, from Costa Rica to southern
Canada. Previous research has suggested that tropi-
cal populations are more adapted to food stress than
temperate populations. In this project you will exam-
ine how ovarian apoptosis varies between tropical and
temperate populations, and the ecological and genetic
inﬂuences on this variation. The central questions are
“Does food availability lead to population diﬀerenti-
ation? Is there suﬃcient variation in the expression
of a conserved mechanism to permit geographic vari-40 EvolDir April 1, 2009

Sett Menus: The ecological & evolutionary origins &
consequences of individual foraging behaviour in group-
living badgers
Primary supervisor: Dr Stuart Bearhop
Deadline for applications: 27 March 2009
This project is part-ﬁnanced by the European Union,
European Social Fund
The extent to which individuals of a species vary in
their exploitation of diﬀerent food resources is an im-
portant feature of foraging ecology and is likely to be an
key component of the ecological and evolutionary dy-
namics of populations, although these ideas have rarely
been tested. Variation in diet occurs at many levels:
within individuals (over seasons, with age and social
rank) and among individuals (between sexes, over dif-
ferent spatial and social scales). Diet at the species level
is therefore a composite of multiple sources of varia-
tion in individual foraging choices. In group-living an-
imals, social structure constrains dietary variation by
imposing territorial limits on foraging and, potentially,
by inducing either socially or genetically heritable for-
aging traits. Disentangling the inﬂuence of heritable
and environmental components of dietary specialisa-
tions therefore requires knowledge of both genetic and
environmental components. As a consequence the pro-
cesses driving foraging specialisations and their evolu-
tionary consequences remain poorly understood.
This PhD will use combination of stable isotope anal-
ysis, radio- tracking, long term pedigree data and the-
oretical modelling to address a series of questions re-
lating to the development and persistence of individual
and group level foraging specialisations in badgers. The
study will evaluate the ﬁtness consequences of diﬀerent
foraging preferences and will be among the ﬁrst to at-
tempt to unravel the roles of the natal environment
versus heritability in establishing such specialisations,
investigating the ontogeny of specialisation and mod-
elling factors that may act as constraints. As the likeli-
hood of TB transmission has been shown to be related
to badger foraging behaviour, a better understanding
of the factors driving foraging specialisations could be
important in the

PhD position in evolutionary genetics
Project: The genetics of reproductive isolation and eco-
logical trait diﬀerences in European Populus
Supervision: Christian Lexer, University of Fribourg,
Switzerland
A PhD position is available in the newly established lab
of Christian Lexer. I am looking for a highly motivated
candidate with interests in the ﬁelds of evolutionary bi-
ology and population genetics. The PhD fellowship is
university-funded, and the project will be tightly linked
with a British NERC-funded research project on the
ecological & evolutionary genomics of species isolation
in European Populus, which involves a postdoc, two
other PhD students, and several collaborating labs in
the EU and USA.
The PhD project will address the genetics of reproduc-
tive isolation and ecological trait diﬀerences in natural
hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula. It is based
on molecular genetic data which my group has gathered
over the last several years, and on recent advances in
the use of admixed populations and hybrid zones for
addressing key questions in ecology & evolution. Key
aspects of the PhD project will be (1) to study the
molecular population genetics of genetic loci involved
in barriers to introgression, (2) to study the genetic ba-
sis of ecological trait diﬀerences in natural populations.
This involves both, experimental lab work (sequencing,
microsatellites, SNPs, interactions with related tran-
scriptomics project) and ecological ﬁeld work (assess-
ing the eﬀects of traits on tree biotic interactions). De-
pending on the interests of the student, there can be a
stronger focus either on the lab or on the ﬁeld compo-
nent. In any case, an interest in the use of new tool s
in computational biology is essential.
The starting date is negotiable (any time from July
2009 onwards). Funding from the university is for three
years (annual salary is ca. CHF 40’000). Knowledge of
French or German is helpful in every day life, but the
working language in the group is English. A Diploma
or Masters degree (or equivalent) in biology or related
subject is necessary for admission. Fribourg is a lively
town with over a quarter of the population being stu-
dents. It is located ca. 30 minutes from the Alps, close
to other cities such as Berne and Lausanne and just aApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 41

UFribourg EvolutionPlantInvasions
1 PhD & 1 Post-Doc Position in Evolutionary Ecology
of Plant Invasions, University of Fribourg, Switzerland
Rationale
The proposed project will be the ﬁrst one that considers
the importance of polyploidy and herbivores for inva-
sions simultaneously. Our leading hypothesis is that
herbivore pressure and assemblage will, at least par-
tially, explain the predominance of speciﬁc cytotypes
both in the native and introduced range. The Centau-
rea stoebe L. (syn. C. maculosa Lam.) (Asteraceae)
system provides an excellent model system to study
these interactions, and we take advantage of the large
knowledge already available on this plant and its her-
bivores. Native to Europe where it occurs as a diploid
(2x) and a tetraploid (4x) cytotype, the species is highly
invasive in North America, where nearly exclusively
only 4x plants have been found. Several specialist in-
sect herbivores have been introduced to North America
for its biological control, with only partial success so
far.
We seek two highly motivated researchers to help clar-
ifying underlying mechanisms of this most successful
plant invasion as a complement to various presently on-
going studies that we carry out in collaboration with
both national (through NCCR Plant Survival) and in-ternational partners. We plan to (i) explore the rela-
tionship between type and amount of herbivory and the
occurrence of the two cytotypes of C. stoebe in its na-
tive range by a European-wide survey combined with
a replant/transplant experiment, (ii) carry out a series
of experiments to analyze interactions between two se-
lected specialist herbivores and the C. stoebe cytotypes,
and (iii) investigate more generally into the role of gen-
eralist herbivores for plant invasions (in collaboration
with Urs Schaﬀner, CABI Europe-Switzerland and our
US counterparts).
Requirements
- PhD position: Master Thesis in Biology, preferentially
in ecology and evolution
- Post-Doc position: doctoral degree in plant ecology
and evolution
For both positions, knowledge of, and experience in one
or several of the following areas of research is desirable:
experimental (ﬁeld) ecology and evolutionary biology,
invasion biology, plant-herbivore interactions, experi-
mental design and statistical analysis; furthermore, ﬂu-
ency in English and driverˆ as license will be required.
Salary and conditions
The positions are funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation, and start April 1, 2009. Salaries: PhD
c. 43ˆ a000 SFr/year for 3 years; Post-Doc dependent on
age and status, gross salary in the ﬁrst year about CHF
70’000, for 2-3 years.

PhD position on plant invasions at CABI Europe-
Switzerland & University of Fribourg
Rationale The plant species Centaurea stoebe (spotted
knapweed), introduced from Central Europe into North
America during the late 19th century, has become a
model for research on the ecological and evolutionary
causes and consequences of invasions. We presently ex-
plore the role of rapid evolutionary processes in the
invasion success of C. stoebe, and try to elucidate the
complex interactions between C. stoebe and natural en-
emies both in the native and the introduced range.
We are now seeking a PhD student highly motivated to
work on the environmental impact of C. stoebe and of
other invasive plant species. The ﬁeld experiments aim
to assess the eﬀects of invasive plants on above-ground
and below-ground ecosystem properties, and on study-
ing the recovery of ecosystems after successful control of
the invasive plant. These studies will be conducted at
various sites in Europe and in North America to assess
the response of communities that share (native range)
or not share (introduced range) a coevolutionary past
with C. stoebe. New ideas and complementary studies
are of course highly invited.

Energy is the currency of life and understanding how
animals gain, use and store energy is essential in help-
ing us to understand how they function in their en-
vironment. Quantiﬁcation of energetics enables us to
understand the shape of the functional response curve
between resource availability and reproductive success.
This is particularly important as animals face changing
environments and competition for their food resources.
Models predict that animals which maximise their en-
ergy gain while minimising their energy intake are likely
to have greater ﬁtness. The proposed project will in-
vestigate the links between rates of energy expenditure
and performance in natural populations of seabirds.
This should allow repeatability and heritability of these
traits to be investigated and the relative importance of
genotypic and phenotypic eﬀects assessed. Seabirds are
an ideal model for studies of this type as they are long-
lived, philopatric, and show considerable reproductive
skew. As a result, multiple generations of successful
individuals can be found breeding alongside less suc-
cessful individuals. The student will measure basal
metabolic rate (BMR) and possibly ﬁeld metabolic rate
and determine how these traits are related to breed-
ing success at diﬀerent scales, while accounting for con-
founding eﬀects such as age and seasonality. Measur-
ing these variables will allow a number of conﬂicting
hypotheses to be tested. Do successful animals have a
low BMR which allows them to consume less food and
pass more to their chick? Will successful animals have
a high BMR, indicative of a high capacity to work andgain resources from their environment?
Opportunities exist for study in a number of diﬀerent
populations of seabirds, both at home and abroad, and
the student will be expected to undertake ﬁeldwork
on isolated islands. Within the broad framework of
the proposed project, there may be chances to develop
experimental/manipulative approaches to answer these
key questions.
Training :
Skills which will be learned during this project will in-
clude: Planning and executing expeditions and ﬁeld-
work. Ornithological/ﬁeldwork techniques such as an-
imal handling, biometric measurements and monitor-
ing of breeding. Ecophysiological techniques including
respirometry, the heart rate method and overall dy-
namic body acceleration (ODBA). Complex data han-
dling in a variety of disciplines. Parametric statistics.
Calculation of repeatability and heritability. Energy
budget modelling. Writing and submission of data for
publication. The student will need to train and apply
for a Home Oﬃce Licence and will become familiar with
the issues surrounding the ethics of experimentation on
wild animals. The project will involve liaison with the
governing and licensing authorities of the ﬁeld sites.

Title: Local adaptation in a generalist multi-host par-
asite of bumble bee queens
Research outline: All animals have parasites, and par-
asites are one of the most important selective pressures
on the ecology and evolution of their hosts. While
we know a lot about parasites that utilize only one
host species, most parasites can use multiple host
species. The ecological and evolutionary implications
of multiple-host use for both the parasite and the
hosts are unclear. The nematode parasite Sphaeru-
laria bombi is a parasite of the queens of numerous
bumble bee species. Parasitised queens are castrated
and behaviourally manipulated by the nematode to
maximize its own reproduction. Understanding how
this parasite impacts bumble bees is important for two
reasons. First, it will provide novel insights into the
ecology and evolution of multiple-host parasites. Sec-
ond, bumble bees are essential pollinators of both wild
and agricultural ﬂowering plants, but they are cur-
rently in signiﬁcant decline throughout Europe and
North America. Sphaerularia bombi may both con-
trol bumble bee populations and arbitrate competi-
tion among bumble bee species. Consequently, under-
standing the dynamics of this complex host-parasite
system has clear implications for the maintenance of
biodiversity. We have developed novel experimental
protocols to enable controlled infections and experi-
ments in the lab. Our recent work has suggested that
this highly virulent parasite exhibits local adaptation
to its suite of host species. This project will com-
bine ﬁeld-work with controlled laboratory infections
and multi-generational selection experiments to exam-
ine the dynamics of local adaptation in this system.
Results from this work will increase our understand-
ing of multi-host parasites in general, as well as il-
luminating the dynamics of an important parasite of
declining pollinators. The project will be supervisedby Dr Mark Brown ( http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Biological-

Graduate student position available at the Department
of Evolutionary biology, Uppsala UniversityA graduate student position in Evolutionary Genet-
ics/genomics is available at the Department of Evolu-
tionary Biology at Uppsala University. This position
oﬀers an opportunity to explore a wide range of evolu-
tionary paradigms, from the genomic consequences of
selﬁng vs outcrossing, to the early steps in the evolution
of sex chromosomes.
Our research group uses the ﬁlamentous ascomycete
genus Neurospora as a model system. Neurospora is
well suited for studies on reproductive systems since its
closely related species exhibit a wide spectrum of re-
productive behavior. Furthermore, we use the mating-
type chromosome of Neurospora tetrasperma as a sim-
ple, general, model for studies of the early evolution of
sex chromosomes from autosomes. It shares features
with the complex sex chromosomes found in the ani-
mal and plant kingdom, but is not aﬀected by complex
sex-biased evolutionary forces such as sexual selection
and male biased mutation rate.
The PhD-project can be developed after the interest of
the applicant, but should preferably involve large scale
SNP-typing and/or high throughput sequencing of nat-
ural populations of Neurospora.
The Program in Evolutionary Biology ( http://-
www.egs.uu.se/evbiol/ index.html) is situated in the
Evolutionary Biology Centre in central Uppsala. The
working atmosphere is international with English as
working language. The Evolutionary Biology Centre
constitutes an exciting arena for multidisciplinary re-
search in evolutionary biology in a broad sense, with re-
search programs including ecology, systematics, genet-
ics, genomics, and developmental biology. Uppsala Uni-
versity is the oldest university in Scandinavia and the
city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with beauti-
ful surroundings conveniently situated 40 minutes with
train from Stockholm.
Required qualiﬁcations for applicants are 1) a MSc in
Biology, Genetics, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology
or related ﬁeld, 2) experience in one or several of the
following areas: bioinformatics, population genetics,
evolutionary biology, genetics, microbiology, mycology,
and 3) demonstrated communication skills in English.
The position is for four years. Start date fall 2009.

UppsalaU SpeciationGenomics
A 4-year PhD position is available at the Department of
Evolutionary Biology at the Evolutionary Biology Cen-
tre in Uppsala, Sweden to study Speciation Genomics.
Background
The study of speciation mechanisms remains one of
the major challenges in fundamental biological research.
With the advent of the genomic era it has become pos-
sible to study the genetic underpinnings of reproduc-
tive isolation (RI). Hybrid zones, often referred to as
natural laboratories of evolution, are ideal systems to
unveil the barriers that keep gene pools from merg-
ing. The European crow hybrid zone where Carrion
Crows (Corvus [corone] corone) and Hooded Crows
(Corvus [corone] cornix meet is an often cited text-
book example of hybridization. In a narrow zone that
stretches across Europe, they produce viable hybrids
that backcross into the parental populations. Morpho-
logical, ecological and behavioural evidence suggest al-
most complete RI. This is traditionally interpreted in
terms of allopatric speciation leading to genome wide
incompatibilities upon secondary contact. Contrary to
the pronounced RI, genetic evidence reveals unexpect-
edly low levels of diﬀerentiation between the two taxa.
Behavioural and theoretical work suggests that diver-
gence may be rooted in sexual imprinting solely based
on diﬀering plumage characteristics.
The project
We use several approaches to understand the genetic
architecture of this hybrid zone including candidate
genes and uninformed genome scans making use of
next-generation sequencing approaches. Recent evi-
dence suggests that diﬀerences in expression proﬁles
may play an important role in the initial steps of species
diﬀerentiation. In the crow system there is a clear hy-
pothesis that genes involved in plumage coloration may
be invoked in the divergence process. The applicant will
study expression patterns in the diﬀerent crow taxa
quantifying expression divergence and identifying the
genes that may contribute to phenotypic diﬀerences.
The work will be done in close cooperation with the
Max Planck Institute of Ornithology in Radolfzell, Ger-
many, where birds are raised. Methodologically, the
project will include laboratory work as well as bioinfor-
matic downstream analyses. The successful applicant
should show a combination of molecular, evolutionaryand population genetic experience. She/he should not
be afraid of handling large data sets and is ideally fa-
miliar with programming (e.g. Unix Shell, Perl). The
student will be jointly supervised by Dr Jochen Wolf
and Prof Hans Ellegren. Starting date is open to dis-
cussion.
Infrastructure
The Evolutionary Biology Centre is one of world’s lead-
ing research institutions in evolutionary biology that
successfully bridges a broad variety of disciplines in the
biological sciences. It is situated in the beautiful small
town of Uppsala in Sweden, that oﬀers rich opportuni-
ties in cultural and outdoor activities and is strongly
inﬂuenced by the 40 000 students living here. The De-
partment of Evolutionary Biology excels in many as-
pects of genetics and evolution and oﬀers an inspir-
ing atmosphere in an international group. Our in-
terests include molecular evolution and evolutionary
genomics with a primary focus on birds. We form
part of a recently launched Centre of Excellence, the
Uppsala Centre for Evolution and Genomics ( http://-

Project description. This project is a collaboration be-
tween theoretical and empirical biologists with the aim
of using data from historical collections to infer the
demographic and evolutionary history of populations.
Such data may come from historical records or may
be obtained from ancient DNA genotyping of museum
specimens (Groombridge et al, 2000). In the last 10
years computer-intensive statistical methods have been
developed (Wang and Whitlock, 2003; Beaumont, 2003;
O’Hara, 2005; Bollback et al., 2008). It is potentially
possible to measure selection coeﬃcients, population
sizes, recombination rates, and migration rates using
historical data. A method is available, based on Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), that can infer population
sizes and selection coeﬃcients for a 3-locus model, in-
cluding linkage, dominance and epistasis. This has been
applied to model temporal changes in morph frequency
in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis.
The aim of this CASE studentship will be to extend
and test the framework that has already been devel-
oped. Large data sets on Cepaea nemoralis populations
sampled over the last century are available to test hy-
potheses concerning the mode of selection operating in
Cepaea. Ancient DNA data are also available to test
the hypotheses that all gene frequency changes are neu-
tral (e.g. Shepherd et al, 2005). Data from Dr Robert
Prys-Jones and Dr Jim Groombridge, Durrell Institute,
Kent, will be used to model changes in gene frequen-
cies over time using ancient DNA from endangered bird
species. The student will be based at the University of
Reading, but will be expected to spend some time with
the CASE partner, Dr Prys-Jones, at the Natural His-
tory Museum.
The successful candidate will be expected to have an ap-
titude for mathematical modelling and programming.
Ideally, it is hoped that this project will attract a stu-
dent with a degree in mathematics, statistics, or com-
puter science, interested in moving into computational
biology. The candidate will also have the opportunity
to generate their own data by genotyping samples, and
thereby obtain training in practical molecular genetics.References Beaumont, M.A. (2003) Estimation of pop-

PhD Studentship Available at University of Sheﬃeld
Project: “Understanding the indirect eﬀects of vacci-
nation programmes: a community ecology approach”
Supervisors: Owen Petchey, Amy Pedersen & Andy
FentonApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 49
We invite highly motivated students to apply for a PhD
studentship (NERC directly funded, UK citizens only)
to develop theoretical models of host-parasite commu-
nity ecology. The studentship will be part of a larger
NERC funded project studying co-infection dynamics
in a wild mouse population in the UK. A background
in mathematical biology and/or quantitative ecology is
recommended, but not essential.
Research outline: In natural systems, individual host
organisms are often co-infected by a number of diﬀer-
ent parasite species. These parasites exploit a range
of host tissues and resources, making resource compe-
tition between parasites likely. The host’s immune sys-
tem attacks parasites, which can cause indirect interac-
tions, such as apparent competition, between parasites.
Viewing the parasites, resources, and immune system
as a community of interacting players is an emerging
area in the ﬁeld of parasitology. However, many un-
certainties exist about within-host parasite communi-
ties. How much resource competition occurs between
parasite species? What is the functional form of the
response of the immune system to parasite intensity?
How strong are tradeoﬀs between diﬀerent components
of the immune system? What are the strengths of direct
and indirect interactions between parasites? The aims
of this research will be to develop within-host parasite
models based on a community ecological approach to
address these questions. In addition, an applied conse-
quence of the interactions between parasites, resources,
and immune responses is their eﬀects on treatment and
vaccination strategies. Since successful vaccination can
be viewed as the extinction of a species from a commu-
nity, a signiﬁcant aim of the project is to use methods
from community ecology to explore the potential indi-
rect consequences of vaccination programmes.
Applications will be accepted until March 27th.
The position will start in September 2009 and be based
in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Uni-
versity of Sheﬃeld. Under special circumstances the
studentship could be taken up in the Institute of Evo-
lutionary Biology at the University of Edinburgh.

UStirling SeedDispersal
Following the withdrawal of a candidate, a three year
full-time PhD studentship has become available in the
School of Biological and Environmental Sciences at the
University of Stirling, United Kingdom.
Application closing date: Wednesday 25th March 2009
for an expected start date in October 2009.
Project description
Waterborne Seed Dispersal of Alnus glutinosa Gaertn
in a River Catchment and Landscape Connectivity of
Riparian Woodlands
Black alder, Alnus glutinosa Gaertn, is the most abun-
dant native tree in Scottish riparian woodlands where
it plays a key ecological role. Despite its importance
in riparian ecosystem function, the population genet-
ics A. glutinosa has been little studied. Long-distance
water dispersal of seeds believed to be driven by ﬂow-
ing water, temporary ﬂooding or wind drift at the wa-
ter surface while wind dispersal should contribute to
short distance dispersal. This project proposes to in-
vestigate the relationship between river ﬂow dynam-
ics and spatial patterns of alder seedling recruitment
and river margin colonisation via waterborne seed dis-
persal in a river catchment using a landscape genetics
approach. Field activities will be based in Scotland;
in the river Tay catchment which contains large areas
of undisturbed alder dominated ﬂoodplain habitat of
high nature conservation value. Laboratory activities
will involve the development of genetic markers and
high throughput genotypin g to detect the parentage
of recruited seedlings by parentage analysis. The pos-
sibility of integrating ecological and genetics data in
a geographically-explicit model may be considered to
predict how river management disturbance aﬀects tree
population dynamics.
The project will require a combination of ﬁeld
work, molecular biology, data analysis and
modelling. If you wish to discuss the project
informally please contact Dr Cecile Bacles
(c.f.bacles@stir.ac.uk <mailto:c.f.bacles@stir.ac.uk >).50 EvolDir April 1, 2009
The entry qualiﬁcation for postgraduate studentships
is a ﬁrst class or upper second class honours degree
in a relevant biological sciences subject, or an ap-
propriate M.Sc. degree. More information about
our graduate school programme may be found on
our website ( http://www.sbes.stir.ac.uk/information/-
postgrad/index.html ).
The studentship covers stipend and will pay UK/EU
tuition fees. The studentship is available to UK or EU
nationals. Owing to funding restrictions applications
from overseas candidates cannot be considered.
Individuals with a background in population genetics
and a keen interest in restoration ecology are encour-

UZurich EvolutionaryTheory
PhD position in Evolution and Ecology
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student
to work on evolutionary theory. Speciﬁcally, the stu-
dent will develop models of bacterial and plasmid evo-
lution. Plasmids can transfer horizontally, from bac-
terium to bacterium, and they seem to carry a biased
set of genes, such as those involved in antibiotic resis-
tance or virulence, or genes that promote cooperation
with other bacteria. We wish to ask why, and when,
such genes should transfer horizontally, rather than in-April 1, 2009 EvolDir 51
tegrating themselves into the host chromosome.
The focus of the project is very broad, and will touch
on cooperation and conﬂict, virulence evolution, eco-
evolutionary feedbacks and also address the levels-of-
selection problem. The project will mostly involve evo-
lutionary modeling, but will also involve close collabo-
ration with empiricists. Students who wish to address
the problem using bioinformatics or microbial experi-
ments will be encouraged to do so.
Zurich is located less than one hour from the Alps, and
is a small but vibrant city that is regarded to have one
of the best standards of living in the world. There is a
large international community and it is well connected
to all major European cities.
The successful applicant will be supervised by Dr
Daniel Rankin ( http://www.rankin.sk/ ), a theoretical
evolutionary biologist interested in a wide range of top-
ics, from social evolution to the link between evolution
and ecology. The position will be based in the Com-
putational Biology and Bioinformatics Group, led by
Professor Andreas Wagner ( http://www.bioc.uzh.ch/-
wagner/ ). The group is very international and con-
sists of a very diverse range of individuals who work on
a wide range of interesting evolutionary topics.
The candidate should have a diploma/MSc degree and
have studied in one of the following ﬁelds: evolution-
ary biology/ecology, mathematics, microbiology or eco-
nomics. Experience with modeling will be an advan-
tage, but is not necessary. The working language of the
group is English, and knowledge German is very helpful
but not necessary.

part of a NERC-funded grant led by Amy Pedersen,Owen Petchey (University of Sheﬃeld) and Andy Fen-
ton (University of Liverpool), involving both ﬁeldwork
(small-mammal trapping) and laboratory assays.
Both posts are based within the Division of Population
and Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological
Sciences, Liverpool, and will be responsible for con-
ducting the small-mammal trapping at our ﬁeld sites
on the Wirral, Merseyside. We are looking for a Senior
technician (Grade 6; £25,623 - £27,183) that has ex-
tensive experience with small-mammal trapping. The
Graduate technician (Grade 5; £22,126 pa) will receive
training in small-mammal trapping and techniques in
parasitology. Opportunities will be available for both
technicians to develop their research interests within
this host- parasite system.
The Senior technician should have relevant experience
and ideally hold a Home Oﬃce personal licence for han-
dling small mammals. Both technicians will be required
to undertake the majority of the intensive trapping on
the project, and so should be familiar with organising
and conducting ﬁeldwork. Both technicians should hold
valid UK driving licences. The posts are available for 3
years, starting in May 2009.
Closing date for receipt of applications is 20 March

DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF
OXFORD
Technician in Evolutionary Ecology & Entomology
Grade 3: starting salary £17,026
A Technician (Grade 3) is required for six months to
cover maternity leave, to work on a BBSRC-funded
project entitled Aphid secondary symbionts: from
model system to crop pests’.
It has recently been shown that facultative bacterial
(secondary) symbionts have a remarkably wide range
of eﬀects on the biology of their aphid hosts. These
include increasing resistance to natural enemies, im-
proved performance on certain host plants, and resis-
tance to heat shock. We seek a technician to help ex-
plore this symbiosis. The project involves the experi-
mental creation of novel aphid-symbiont combinations
to investigate how host and bacterial genotypes inter-
act to aﬀect aphid ﬁtness and how the symbiont may
inﬂuence clonal competition and aphid population dy-
namics under diﬀerent environmental conditions. This
includes any possible eﬀects of symbionts on indirect in-
teractions between aphid species mediated by natural
enemies.
You should have a strong interest in biology and en-
joy working in a laboratory environment and as part of
a team. You should have an aptitude for work where
attention to detail and record keeping is critical. Ide-
ally you should have experience working with insects
in laboratories, and also with basic molecular genetic
techniques.
This is a collaborative project involving the
Universities of Oxford (Prof. Charles Godfray
(charles.godfray@zoo.ox.ac.uk) and Dr. Margriet van
Asch (Margriet.vanAsch@zoo.ox.ac.uk), University of

AFLP bands extraction method
choice
Dear all,
I am currently planning to do an AFLP genome scan
with two closely related species, in order to detect re-
gions of their genome that display a high level of diver-
gence (see for ex. Wood et al. Mol Ecol 2008). The
original AFLP genome scan will be performed on an
ABI 3730 sequencer. However since we would like to
further characterize the outlier loci, we will need to run
again the selective ampliﬁcation and to load it into a
gel, then excise bands of interest, reamplify and clone
them. This will probably be done with many primer
pairs.
We never performed that in our lab, and I am wonder-
ing what is the most robust/eﬃcient/precise/safe/quick
way to do it. We cannot do radiolabelling in our lab.
As far as I know, people most of the time use one of
the followings:
- Silver stained acrylamide gel. Allows precise elec-
trophoresis and to keep the gel for later use. Maybe
quite labour intensive if many gels have to be run? -
Precast Spreadex (Elchrom) gels. Seems precise and
safe, but one needs to cut the bands with a UV ta-
ble within a few minutes. Also as far as I know the
maximum length of a spreadex gel is 8 cm, and this
seems small to me to precisely excise a band. - Nusieve
agarose. I am not sure this is realistic. Maybe two stepselectrophoresis: 1/ the whole ampliﬁcation, cut around
the band of interest, reamplify then 2/ load this sec-
ond ampliﬁcation with fewer bands into an adequately
concentrated agarose gel.
Does someone have experience with that? Can anyone
suggest other options?
Any help/advice greatly appreciated.
Matthieu
PS: We have currently no vertical acrylamide elec-
trophoresis apparatus but this can be purchased.

A Keast passing
Dr. Allen Keast passed away yesterday, 8 March, at
about noon, in Kingston General Hospital where he was
admitted about three weeks ago due to an infection in
his heart. He was in his 87th year.
Allen was born November 15, 1922 in Sydney, New
South Wales, Australia. He was an avid naturalist
from his earliest boyhood, a passion that he pursued in
university and throughout his career. Following high68 EvolDir April 1, 2009
school, Allen served in the Australian Army, being
stationed for some 20 months in New Guinea. Upon
completion of his military service, Allen attended the
University of Sydney from 1946 to 1950 when he was
awarded a B.Sc. with ﬁrst class Honours. He continued
his education at Sydney, while also holding a post as
Assistant curator of Birds, Reptiles and Amphibians at
the Australian Museum, and earned an M.Sc. degree
in 1952. In 1953 Allen was awarded the Peter Brooks
Saltonstall Scholarship at Harvard for his PhD stud-
ies. At Harvard, Allen was the ﬁrst graduate student
supervised by one of the leading evolutionary biologists
of our time, Professor Ernst Mayr. He also worked with
the renowned comparative anatomist, Alfred Sherwood
Romer. After earning his PhD in 1955, Allen became
Curator of Birds, Reptiles and Amphibians at the Aus-
tralian Museum in Sydney, a position he held from 1955
to 1960. He then held a Visiting Researcher position
at the Edward Grey Institute at Oxford University, as
well as an appointment in 1962 as Visiting Biologist in
South African National Parks, Pretoria, South Africa.
Allen joined the Biology Department at Queen’s Uni-
versity in Kingston, Ontario, Canada in 1962, as Assis-
tant Professor and quickly moved up through the ranks
to Full Professor, a position that he held until his re-
tirement in 1989.
Allen had a very strong interest in Australian natu-
ral history and he was also keenly interested in func-
tional morphology and the role of evolution in shap-
ing adaptations and hence community structure. He
recognized that the fauna of the very isolated island-
continent of Australia was very diﬀerent from that of
the southern continents of Africa and South America
and this led Allen to produce major works on evolution
in the Southern continents. Upon coming to Queen’s,
and ﬁnding himself in Canada, Allen was faced with a
diﬀerent biota in the cold-dominated, highly seasonal
north temperate region, and he saw an opportunity to
study biogeography and the forces molding community
structure on a much smaller scale ’ that of the ﬁsh
fauna in the isolated lakes of southern Ontario. He
established a ﬁeld program at the Queen1s University
Biological Station (QUBS) at Lake Opinicon, and for
more than 30 years examined comparative morphology
and competition in those ﬁsh communities.
Through his career at Queen1s, Allen trained many un-
dergraduates and at least 27 graduate students. He
published at least 50 primary research papers, 60 book
and conference chapters and 7 books on biogeography.
His work served to draw the attention of the world1s
ecologists and evolutionary biologists to the unique bio-
geography of Australia. In the Canadian lakes, his sec-
ond ﬁeld of research on the ecology of ﬁsh communi-ties, he was a leader in demonstrating that the ecology
of ﬁshes changes dramatically as they grow. He rec-
ognized and took advantage of the unique opportunity
that lakes provide ’ that of a suite of organisms locked
in isolation in a common environment, often competing
for common resources. Over the 25 years he studied ﬁsh
communities in Eastern Ontario1s myriad lakes, espe-
cially at the Queen1s University Biological Station, he
produced another 30 scientiﬁc papers in this ﬁeld.
One of Allen’s great strengths was to synthesize. Dur-
ing his career, he edited or co-edited numerous vol-
umes on evolution, biogeography and the relationships
of biota. One of his more signiﬁcant works was a 1980
volume on “Migrant Birds in the Neotropics” co-edited
with Eugene Morton, that focused attention on issues
of conservation for species that inhabit multiple regions
throughout their life cycle.
As Professor Emeritus following his retirement, Allen
maintained an active interest in ﬁeld studies, and espe-
cially in writing. He maintained an active interest in
the department, and especially in the Biology Station,
right up until his death. He will be greatly missed by
many friends and colleagues.
Allen was predeceased by a younger brother, John. He
is survived by his sister, Janet Baker, who with her
husband, Sid, lives near Seattle.
His funeral will be held this Friday March 13, 2009 in
Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Analyzing GO terms
Hello List,
I have a question concerning the evolutionary analysis
of diﬀerent gene sets from the same organism using GO
terms.
Here is what I want to do: I have a tree over which
I trace gene content, so a more basal node will have
only a subset of the genes a terminal node (species A)
has. The analysis I am looking for should compare the
diﬀerent nodes in respect to their genes and give in-
formation on how the genes diﬀer in function/role (if
at all). The expectation is that genes at a more basal
node will overall fall into a diﬀerent functional categoryApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 69
as those genes gained towards the tip (Species A).
GO terms are the most straight-forward data I can get
my hands on, so I was hoping to ﬁnd a way to use
them as a basis for the analysis. However, given that
GO terms are a bit of a mess (not strictly hierarchical,
to begin with - and several GO terms / gene), I am
looking for examples of how to do this. GO Slim was
one thing I looked into, but I couldn’t ﬁnd really good
tools for that.
To put it a little diﬀerent - I need to bin genes into dis-
crete categories based on GO terms in order to compare
sets of genes so that I can check whether they diﬀer in
function. On top of that, the sets of genes are nested
- but that’s a minor detail and probably not entirely
relevant to the original question.
Any advice (programs, publications, etc) would be
greatly appreciated!
Cheers, Marc

BigDye dilutions for ABI310
answers
Dear Evoldir members,
Here are the replies I received to my original posting:
“I’d be grateful to anyone who could tell me about their
experiences of diluting BigDye for the ABI 310 capil-
lary sequencer. I’d also be interested to hear from any-
one who has tried the dLUTE SEQ DNA Sequencing
BigDye Dilution Reagent on the ABI 3130.”
For those who asked, information about the dLUTE
SEQ DNA sequencing reagent can be found at

Dear Dr. Bloor, While I can’t address dilluting bigdye,
I can say that I’ve used what we call ‘quarter reactions.‘
This saves us considerable reagents. Taken from my in-
stitute’s Nucleic Acid facility:
“1/4 Reaction: For each reaction add the following
reagents to individual tubes:70 EvolDir April 1, 2009
Terminator Ready Reaction mix (Big Dye) 2 ul Big
Dye Sequencing Buﬀer 5X 1 ul Primer 1ul (3.2 pmol)
Template See table for Template guidelines Water To
11 ul
Total volume 11 ul”
http://mercury.bio.uaf.edu/core/protocols/-
cyclesequencingrxn.html This has worked very
well for us, and I reliably get clear sequences.
I hope this saves you as much time and money as it has
saved us.
Best Wishes, Kevin Colson

Hi Paul,
You can dilute the big dye to 1/8 reactions routinely
(compared to ABI protocols) and sometimes you can
get away with 1/16, but it also depends on amount of
template and length of your PCR product. We did this
with a 310, then 3100, and now 3130. It is very rou-
tinely done.
I haven’t tried the reagent that you mention below and
I am interested to ﬁnd out what you hear. Who makes
that reagent?
thanks, Sarah

Hi Paul,
I have used up to 1/8 dilution of Big Dye terminators
on various ABi platforms. Most commonly I use 0.5 ul
in 10 ul reaction. Never had a problem with diluted Big
Dye. ABi want us to use more because it’s so damn ex-
pensive! Some people also use home-made buﬀer rather
than shelling out for their original stock. Of course ABi
claim the reactions don’t work as well but big facilities
make their own on a regular basis.
Good luck,
Birgit

Hi,
I use 1 to 0.3 uL big dye per sequencing reaction (10uL).
Maybe one can go less.
I have tried the dLUTE kit with no success. I onlytried it twice but neither time did I get any results and
I gave up. Because it that kit diﬀers at every step (has
its own precipitation, for example) troubleshooting will
require commitment. Maybe it is worth it.
Good luck,
Kathryn

I always use a 1/8 dilution (0.5 ul Ready Reaction mix
in a 10 ul reaction, run on a 3130xl sequencer if that
makes a diﬀerence), with good results. I don’t think
going above 1/4 improves things much (though I admit
I haven’t done many controlled experiments). There
are people who use 1/16 or less, but the few times I’ve
tried it, I’ve had poor results. I think your PCR has
to be extremely clean, and the amounts of primer and
template DNA exactly right, for that to work.
The full recipe I use per reaction is 0.5 ul BigDye, 1.8
ul 5x buﬀer, 2.4 ul water, 0.3 ul primer (10 uM), 5 ul
template+water (ratio depending on template concen-
tration).
Karl
— Dear Paul,
In my previous lab, we successfully used 0.5 ul BD/10
ul reaction. I’ve attached my excel template that calcu-
lates the master mix with the appropriate amount of di-
lution buﬀer (2nd sheet also has the template amounts
we used).
Given the ridiculously high price of the dilution buﬀer
from ABI, I asked for recipes on evoldir a few years back
and have attached the answers I got. We ended up pur-
chasing the buﬀer from Teknova, as recommended by
Rosanna Giordano (see product numbers in the .doc
ﬁle) you get a huge amount for ~$40 and it worked
great.
Good luck! Leslie
—
I have no experience with the 310, but with the 37030xl.
But i can say that 0.5 ul in a 10ul reactionm works just
ﬁne. Our reactions contain 5.9 ul ddH2O, 2 ul 2x seq
buﬀer (we make our own), 0.6 ul primer (10 nmol),
0.5 ul BigDye, 1 ul PCR (SAP/EXO cleaned and undi-
luted). This works in 95% of situations. hope this helps

I’ve gotten good results (just as good as at full strength)
using 1/4X and 1/8X dilutions. I got the idea from
Travis Glenn (who probably has recipes at his website).

Dear Paul,

used it very long time ago.

BlockingSolution DNAHybridization
Dear all,
we have a problem with hybridization of nucleic acids
(or rather bacteria) on membranes using ﬂuorescin-
labelled probes.
We have formerly used a ready-made solution for hy-
bridization and blocking called “Liquid block” pro-
duced by Amersham. Obviously the company does not
produce this any longer and is not willing to tell what
it contained (Tris, Casein and probably a few other
things).
Could anyone who has also run out of their stocks of
“Liquid block” are now using?

Microsats ampliﬁcation
Hi,April 1, 2009 EvolDir 73
We’ve encountered a strange problem with ﬂuorescently
labeled microsat markers in a gastropod - all are ampli-
fying well (and produce distinct bands on agarose gels)
but when we genotype them on our sequencer, we get
extremely weak (in most cases unscorable) peaks. This
problem is taxon-speciﬁc: in a ﬁsh that we run along as
a control, we get PCR products with approximately the
same concentration, but the peaks are easily scorable,
so there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with our
reagents.
Changing the number of cycles (we’ve tried between 30
and 40) and/or salt concentration (2.5 - 6 mM) doesn’t
solve it.
Perhaps someone in this forum has come across the
same problem?
Thanks for any suggestions, Peter

graduate, masters, and PhD students as well as
postdocs to obtain hands-on experience writing andextending open-source software as part of a distributed
collaborative software development team building a
Virtual Data Center (VDC) that includes major data
and metadata repositories in those ﬁelds.
Trainees accepted into the program will receive a
stipend ($4,500), and with the exception of attending
one meeting near the beginning and one near the end
of the 3-month program period may work from their
home, or home institution. Travel costs incurred in
connection with the meetings will be reimbursed. Each
student will have at least one dedicated mentor to show
them the ropes and help them complete their project.
Initial project ideas are listed on the website. These
range from validation of metadata and identiﬁer reso-
lution, to supporting LSID and semantic-web compli-
ant PURLs for digital data objects, to implementing
modern web-service APIs, to cataloging the diversity of
metadata schemas. The project ideas are ﬂexible and
can be adjusted in scope to match the skills of the stu-
dent. We also welcome novel project ideas that dovetail
with student interests.
The traineeships are supported by a National Science
Foundation (NSF) grant to a consortium of major
repositories for biodiversity, earth and environmental,
ecological, and evolutionary science. The consortium

Nst Gst phylogeographic signature
Hi all,
I’m trying to use the approach suggested in SPAGeDi
1.2 (O. Hardy and X. Vekemans 2007) to test for the
existence of a signiﬁcant phylogeographic signal, using
mtDNA sequence data. However there is an issue that
is not entirely clear to me: in cases when a Nst >Gst>
0 but the slope of pairwise Nst vs geographic distance is
not signiﬁcant, what could be plausible explanations?
Can anyone give me any suggestions about this issue or
can suggest some paper, book, that could be of help if
further questions or doubts storm me?
many thanks

Qiagen gel extractions kitApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 75
Dear Colleagues,
About a year ago I posted a message about prob-
lems with gel puriﬁcations (low yields and absorbance
around 230 nm on Nanodrop). We never resolved the
problem until a colleague has just been in touch with
Qiagen again. Now they admit that they increased the
salt concentration in the QG buﬀer and recommend to
increase the incubation time with PE to aid with the
salt removal. My colleague change to the Promega kit
and gets good results! If you still have Qiagen kit sitting
around and encounter the same problem my suggestion
is to increase the incubation period with PE and maybe
also do 2 washes.
I would be interested to hear you experience.

Resampling PhiST answers
Hi all, please see my original query to EvolDir below
and (few) replies. If any further suggestions are forth-
coming please e-mail me: markus.debruyn@gmail.com
Thanks, Mark
Dear Colleagues,
We would like to test whether 3 pairwise PhiST es-
timates, and 3 Pi estimates are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from one another (single locus - mtDNA HVR). I un-
derstand one method of doing so is by bootstrapping.76 EvolDir April 1, 2009
Is this the preferable method, and does anyone know
of a program that would automate these calculations?
(Arelquin and FSTAT would appear to require data
from at least 4-6 loci). Alternatively, instructions for
doing this ’by hand’ would be greatly appreciated.
Bootstrapping Fst and friends is done over loci, so it
should be easy...
There are methods for bootstrapping over populations,
but I’m not convinced by them in general (O’Hara, R.B.
and Meril¨ a, J., 2005. Genetics 171: 1331-1339), and for
2 populations, it’ll obviously be diﬃcult to bootstrap.
You should be able to construct a parametric bootstrap,
by re-sampling the data from a multinomial distribu-
tion, with probabilities equal to the observed allele fre-
quencies. This might be worth testing ﬁrst, though -
I’m not sure how much of a bias in induced if you have
rare alleles that are not in the sample.

Hi Markus,
Regarding your query to evoldir. The reason Fstat etc
require multiple loci to bootstrap conﬁdence intervals is
that the unit used for bootstrapping is the locus. Thus
it is not possible to sample randomly from a distribu-
tion of loci unless you have more than one. Moreover,
it has been shown that the bootstrap method can be
very unreliable when performed across less than ﬁve
loci. It is possible to bootstrap across other units (e.g.
individuals) but you have to ask the question - where
is my uncertainty? Is it that the individuals in your
sample are a representative random sample from your
population; or is it that your locus is a representative
sample of the genome? In all likelihood your locus/loci
are a very small sample of the entire genome, which is
why you want to estimate the Cis. This is the case for
most population genetics studies that use a relatively
small number of loci to infer neutral genetic diversity
(and the process acting upon it) as a sample from a
potentially very large genome, hence the tendency to
bootstrap across multiple loci. In your case bootstrap-
ping is not an option I’m afraid - you have nothing
to bootstrap! There may be some other tests that are
more applicable and I hope you will get some answers
from your query that will help. I would also say that
p values are not the be all and end all. If your tests
show large biological diﬀerences than you should focus
on that.
All the bestMatt

Scoring package AFLP analysis
Dear Evoldir members,
We have recently released an R CRAN library to au-
tomatize the scoring of AFLPs; RawGeno. The library
includes: - An objective scoring solution for AFLPs
- Visualization and Preliminary analyses (PCR plates
checking, PCoA, heatmap) - Exporting functions to
other programs (Paup, MrBayes, Structure and others)
Finally, RawGeno inculdes a Graphical User Interface
to simplify its use; command line users can also pro-
gram routines.
RawGeno can be downloaded from: http://-
sourceforge.net/projects/rawgeno/ More details

Selfpublishing SpeciesDescriptions
Subject: ICZN and self-publishing of species names
Dear all,
Evoldir subscribers interested in taxonomy and nomen-
clature please read on.
A self-proclaimed taxonomist is erecting dozens of new
species every month in a series of self-published papers,
based on information the scientiﬁc community gener-
ally considers extremely dubious. Until recently, this
has mainly concerned Australian snakes, but the latest
papers totally revise the North American rattlesnakes
and have caused uproar in North American herpetolog-
ical circles.April 1, 2009 EvolDir 77
PDFs of the papers, in a self-published journal called
“The Australasian Journal of Herpetology”, can be
found here:
http://www.smuggled.com/AJHFP1.htm http:/-
/www.reptileforums.net/forums/snakes/62848-
rattlesnake-taxonomy-paper.html Note the ﬁrst
website is blocked on some servers!
The papers are distributed in hard copy and so count
as “published” and valid under ICZN rules (Interna-
tional Code of Zoological Nomenclature): as the journal
states, “Print copies are distributed to major libraries
and institutions that satisfy deposit requirements of the
ICZN, ANL and similar bodies. ”
New species will continue to be described in self-
published works for the foreseeable future unless the
ICZN tightens rules on what counts as published (e.g.
only journals indexed by Science Citation Index and
books with an ISBN number and a recognised scientiﬁc
publisher).
Do Evoldir members think taxonomy beneﬁts - or is
seriously hampered - by the ICZN formally recognising
species, in self-published works?
I would encourage Evol Dir members to petition the
ICZN if they have strong views on this matter: to date,
they have strenously resisted including peer review etc
in the requirements for a species name to count as “pub-
lished”. The ICZN committee can be contacted here:

Software NOBLAST JAMBLAST
Dear Evoldir members,
I am happy to announce the release of the: NOBLAST
and JAMBLAST softwares freely available with source
code, docs, packages and standalone executables
available for a variety of systems (linux windows,
sources..) from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/-
projects/NOBLAST http://sourceforge.net/projects/-
JAMBLAST General presentation:
NOBLAST(New Options for BLAST) provides:
1) a new extended user-friendly tabular output for-mat that can be directly analysed with any spreadsheet
(OpenOﬃce, Excel...) and/or any database engine (e.g.
MySQL) without any use of a parser. This new op-
tion extends (-m parameter) the blastall, blastcl3 and
blastpgp software and is available for various NCBI
BLAST programs: Blastn, Blastp, Blastx, Tblastn,
Tblastx, Mega BLAST and Psi BLAST.
2) distributed/parallel BLAST functionality with exact
E-value adjustment when split database are used.
NOBLAST is an open source patch for blastall,
blastcl3, blastpgp and formatdb from the NCBI toolkit.
JAMBLAST (Java Application Manager for BLAST
results) is an additional Java cross-platform applica-
tion which can be used optionally for the management
of the BLAST outputs produced by NOBLAST, using
MySQL. It also oﬀers visualization, sorting, ¨ ı, export-
ing... of the results according to user-de¨ ıcriteria.

Stenamma ant samples
Dear Evolutionary Biologists,
I am a graduate student at the University of California,
Davis and I work on the systematics of the ant genus
Stenamma. One of my goals is to produce a broad-scale
phylogeny of the genus. However, I have not been able
to obtain fresh specimens from Europe or Asia. If you
have any recently collected specimens perserved in 90-
100% etoh I would be very grateful if you could send
me a few. The genus is a cold hardy cryptic group,
whose members are most often ecountered in forest leaf
litter samples (Winkler or Berlese). Please let me know
if you can help in any way.

Stress adapted ﬂies
Desiccation Selected Flies Seek Home
Students of Howard Rundle and I are at the con-
clusion of a desiccation selection experiment with D.
melanogaster, and neither of us plans to hold onto the
populations. Here is a quick overview for anyone inter-
ested in adoption.
The lines were founded in 2005 from LHm stock (a Cal-
ifornia population collected in the late 80s and domesti-
cated in Bill Rice’s lab). The selected lines are unusual
in having two diﬀerent eye colours installed (3 desic-
cation wild-type populations and 2 desiccation brown-
eyed populations, and matched controls that undergo
starvation) in order to facilitate studies of mate choice
and sperm competition. They are kept at census sizes
of 1200-1300 adults and have been selected for 88 gen-
erations now. They resist stress over 4x longer than
controls or ancestors (close to 2 days in zero humidity).
Anyone who has tried selection on this character will
know that it is a serious chore, which is all the more rea-
son we’d like to see these lines go to a good new home.
For more information, we have a recent paper in J. Ge-
netics’ special issue on evolutionary genetics ( http:/-

me for details.

Texas creationism
Please forward the following appeal for help to

Begin forwarded message:
Click to view this email in a browser
Dear Colleagues,
The Texas State Board of Education is considering sev-
eral changes to the state science curriculum that will
undermine eﬀective coverage of evolution in high-school
biology classes. Proposed anti-evolution language will
also put pressure on textbook publishers to incorpo-
rate creationist criticisms of evolution or else risk being
excluded from the monolithic Texas textbook market.
The board members are receiving thousands of emails
from creationists supporting the current curriculum
draft. To keep scientiﬁcally unfounded arguments out
of our schools’ biology classes, we need help from each
and every one of you. Please email the 15 members of
the State Board and urge them to
(1) adopt the scientiﬁcally sound curriculum standards
drafted by a working group of teachers and scientists in
December, and
(2) reject amendments to these standards that have
been proposed by anti-evolution members of the State
Board of Education.
Below, we provide instructions on how to contact State
Board of Education members. Although we include a
form letter below, we encourage you to personalize the
email. Below, we also provide a succinct explanation of
the current status of curriculum revision in Texas.

PS If you know of colleagues who have not yet
signed the 21st Century Science Coalition statement,
please forward them this e-mail or direct them to
www.texasscientists.org . What you can do to help
Please email members of the State Board Of Educa-
tion, encouraging them to adopt the original draft of
the standards proposed by working groups in Decem-
ber.
You can email the entire SBOE directly at
sboeteks@tea.state.tx.us.
Here is a template for an email to the SBOE (we en-
courage you to personalize this):
To the Texas State Board of Education,
As a scientist and active researcher and educator, I am
writing to urge you to support sound science education
in Texas. In particular, I request that you adopt the Bi-
ology and Earth Sciences TEKS draft as originally pro-
posed by the Working Groups. These working groups
are composed of educators and scientists with deep
expertise in science, and their proposed TEKS drafts
should be given unreserved support without amend-
ment.
In particular, I object to the recent changes made to
the highschool TEKS (subchapter C) section 112.34
(c) 7.B: “analyze and evaluate the suﬃciency or in-
suﬃciency of common ancestry to explain the sudden
appearance, stasis, and sequential nature of groups in
the fossil record;” This language inaccurately insinu-
ates that the fossil record supports long-standing cre-
ationist arguments that existing species were created as
they exist today. The present wording is misleading. I
also object to changes to section 112.36 (c) 8.A, which
now read: “evaluate a variety of fossil types, proposed
transitional fossils, fossil lineages, and signiﬁcant fos-
sil deposits and assess the arguments for and against
universal common descent in light of this fossil evi-
dence” ; Transitional fossils are not “proposed” - they
are clearly documented based on detailed anatomical
measurements. Also, the phrase “arguments for and
against universal common descent” is a common cre-
ationist phrase that inaccurately suggests that there is
credible scientiﬁc data arguing against common ances-
try.
In conclusion, please revert to the original workingApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 81
group version of the science TEKS, and resist addi-
tional changes that are not approved by the working
groups of scientists and educators.

Some suggestions for emailing the SBOE
1. You can specify in your email to
sboeteks@tea.state.tx.us that you wish your mes-

help if you take advantage of this and vary your
tone depending on which members you are writing
to. For instance, the Science Supporters [Bob Craig;
Mary Helen Berlanga; Pat Hardy; Rene Nunez; Mavis
Knight] cast diﬃcult votes to support evolution in the
TEKS, and are being hammered by angry emails from
creationists. When emailing these members, please be

Tree of Life Poster
Dear Evolutionary BiologistsA friend of mine is a teacher at a Swiss high school and
is looking for posters that depict the tree of life (not
too heavy on the phylogenetic part, but accurate in
the relationships, with nice colorful pictures of organ-
isms, maybe even with more than just the animals). A
quick search on the internet showed me that (at least in
Switzerland) there are not many good posters available
in online shops.
Do you know about any good resources (I am sure there
are), where you can order such posters? Or other in-
teresting items that are interesting and fun for kids to
look at (and concern evolution)? It just occurred to
me that I, as an evolutionary biologist, should be able
to provide such information, especially in the Darwin
year!

Project description V Background: This project aims
to shed light into the origin of the genomes of apicom-
plexan parasites. Apicomplexans are among the most
harmful pathogens of humans and livestock, making
these parasites economically important and focal or-
ganisms for medical research. In a continuous eﬀort to
understand better the biology of these parasites, sev-
eral apicomplexan genomes have been completely se-
quenced and more are on the way. While multiple full
genomes represent a great deal of data compared to
many other eukaryotic groups, the extreme divergence
in sequence and genome architecture among species and
lineages precludes comprehensive comparative genomic
analysis involving representatives of diﬀerent apicom-
plexan lineages. This panorama is further obscured by
the highly unusual genome composition in some groups84 EvolDir April 1, 2009
(e.g. 80%AT in Plasmodum genomes). In order to
reconstruct an accurate picture of the origin and evo-
lution of apicomplexan genomes, we need to acquire
data from organisms representing lineages that appear
to have retained a large number of ancestral character-
istics. Current evidence suggests that gregarines and
colpodellids form the stem group from which all other
apicomplexans are derived and are expected to pro-
vide unparalleled insights into the basic genomic char-
acteristics from which each lineage evolved their unique
properties. In comparison to the wealth of genomic
data from human or zoonotic apicomplexan parasites,
genomic data from these basal apicomplexans is very
scarce. i Outline of the Proposed Research and Meth-
ods: The project involves the generation and analy-
sis of EST and genomic surveys of gregarine species
from coastal BC invertebrates and possibly other re-
lated protists. The initial stage of the project involves
collection of invertebrate hosts from coastal BC and
Vancouver Island locations and further processing in
the lab to recover gregarine material and prepare high
quality DNA/RNA for sequencing. At a second stage,
genome and transcriptome sequence surveys will be car-
ried out through genomic/cDNA library construction or
second-generation sequencing in order to generate large
amounts of sequence data. The candidate will curate
and annotate the raw data using powerful computa-
tional resources available form the CGEB at Dalhousie
University. In addition to sequence generation, cura-
tion and basic analysis, the candidate is expected to
conduct
quality research on questions relevant to the interests
of either or both groups. Such questions include, but
are not limited to, exploring the relationships between
genomic reduction, genome plasticity and gene expres-
sion, the study of the basic properties of apicomplexan
gene regulation, gain insight into plastid evolution in
alveolates, improve the phylogenetic backbone of api-
complexans and

Philippe Oger. The lab will combine computational
and experimental approaches to studying the adapta-
tion of procaryotes to life under high hydrostatic pres-
sure (termed piezophily). Three diﬀerent scenarios sup-
ported by experimental evidence actually coexist to ex-
plain this adaptation, which involve either the occur-
rence of speciﬁc genes, the ﬁne tuning of gene rregula-
tion or a more generalized adaptation of protein struc-
tures to high pressure conditions. Our long-term goals
are to better understand at what level the adaptation to
high pressure in procaryotes occurs. The project details
are ﬂexible, but will focus on comparing the genomes
of sequenced known piezophiles with closely related
known piezosensitives to extract relevant genomic di-
vergences linked to piezophily that can be tested ex-
perimentally using the tools developped in the lab for
the in situ characterization of molecules and enzymatic
activities.
Lyon is the second town of France, reputed for its gas-
tronomy. It oﬀers a very strong research environment.
Ecole Normale is a small University-like structure lo-
cated in the south of the town ( www.ens-lyon.fr ), with
13 labs engaged in research from Pure and Applied
Mathematics to Earth Sciences. There is plenty of op-
portunity to interact with other labs, and especially
the “Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie evolutive”
of the University of Lyon ( http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/ ),
with whom the program is developped.
To apply, please email a CV, brief description of re-
search experience and interests, and contact informa-
tion for at least two references to poger[at]ens-lyon.fr.
The position can begin any time after April 1, 2009.

Two Post-Doc Positions in Speciation Gene and Mei-
otic Drive in Drosophila in Emory University
Two post-doc positions funded by NIH are available
starting on April 1, 2009 in the lab of Yun Tao at the
Emory University Department of Biology on mapping,
cloning and molecularly charactering genes involved in
meiotic drive and speciation in Drosophila simulans.
The start date is ﬂexible from April to middle summer,
2009. The initial appointment will be one year but ex-
tendable up to four years. Postdoc salary follows NIH
standard.
The goals of the project are (1) to characterize two mei-
otic drive systems (Winters and Durham) in D. simu-
lans; (2) to characterize the speciation genes between
D. simulans and D. mauritiana; (3) to trace the molec-
ular evolution of the genes involved in meiotic drive and
speciation; and (4) ﬁnally to test the theory that mei-
otic drive is a major mechanism leading to speciation.
Some background of the project can be found in the
three publications (Tao et al. 2001 PNAS 98: 13183-8;
Tao et al. 2007a PLoS Biology 5(11): e292; Tao et al.
2007b PLoS Biology 5(11); e293. )
Candidates for these two positions should have demon-
strated expertise in one or more of the following areas:
Drosophila genetics, standard molecular biology lab
techniques, small RNA, bioinformatics, molecular evo-
lution, evolutionary genetics (experimental or theory).
Candidates are expected to be highly motivated, inde-
pendent, eager to learn new skills and explore new in-
tellectual territories. Successful applicants are encour-
aged to develop new and independent research projects
in the broad ﬁeld of evolutionary genetics, particularly
in genetic conﬂicts and speciation.

*Project *The successful applicant will participate in
advancing a new supermodel of evolutionary genomics,
the three-spined stickleback. Our primary goal is to
conduct a large scale screening project for genome-
wide adaptive genetic variation in diﬀerent populations
of the three-spined stickleback. The screen for poly-
morphic sites (e.g. SNPs) within and among popu-
lations/ecotypes involves massively parallel sequencing
(454 technology) of both, expressed sequence tags, and
enriched selected areas of the genome. The success-
ful applicant will perform bioinformatic processing and

involved in the biological interpretation of data. The
overall goal is to establish a new evolutionary tool for
studying the genetics of adaptation in the model organ-
ism three-spined stickleback.
*Background *The candidate should have a PhD
in molecular biology, bioinformatics or any related
ﬁeld. Practical experience in either state of the
art molecular techniques or computer-based large-scale
sequence analysis, including bioinformatic program-
ming/scripting and biostatistics are required. Exper-
tise in next generation sequencing technologies and a
good publication record would be advantageous.
*Working environment *Details about the depart-
ment’s research activities can be found under:

UFribourg EvolutionPlantInvasions
1 PhD & 1 Post-Doc Position in Evolutionary Ecology
of Plant Invasions, University of Fribourg, Switzerland
Rationale
The proposed project will be the ﬁrst one that considers
the importance of polyploidy and herbivores for inva-
sions simultaneously. Our leading hypothesis is that
herbivore pressure and assemblage will, at least par-
tially, explain the predominance of speciﬁc cytotypes
both in the native and introduced range. The Centau-
rea stoebe L. (syn. C. maculosa Lam.) (Asteraceae)
system provides an excellent model system to study
these interactions, and we take advantage of the large
knowledge already available on this plant and its her-
bivores. Native to Europe where it occurs as a diploid
(2x) and a tetraploid (4x) cytotype, the species is highly
invasive in North America, where nearly exclusively
only 4x plants have been found. Several specialist in-
sect herbivores have been introduced to North America
for its biological control, with only partial success so
far.
We seek two highly motivated researchers to help clar-
ifying underlying mechanisms of this most successful
plant invasion as a complement to various presently on-
going studies that we carry out in collaboration with
both national (through NCCR Plant Survival) and in-
ternational partners. We plan to (i) explore the rela-
tionship between type and amount of herbivory and the
occurrence of the two cytotypes of C. stoebe in its na-
tive range by a European-wide survey combined with
a replant/transplant experiment, (ii) carry out a series
of experiments to analyze interactions between two se-94 EvolDir April 1, 2009
lected specialist herbivores and the C. stoebe cytotypes,
and (iii) investigate more generally into the role of gen-
eralist herbivores for plant invasions (in collaboration
with Urs Schaﬀner, CABI Europe-Switzerland and our
US counterparts).
Requirements
- PhD position: Master Thesis in Biology, preferentially
in ecology and evolution
- Post-Doc position: doctoral degree in plant ecology
and evolution
For both positions, knowledge of, and experience in one
or several of the following areas of research is desirable:
experimental (ﬁeld) ecology and evolutionary biology,
invasion biology, plant-herbivore interactions, experi-
mental design and statistical analysis; furthermore, ﬂu-
ency in English and driverˆ as license will be required.
Salary and conditions
The positions are funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation, and start April 1, 2009. Salaries: PhD
c. 43ˆ a000 SFr/year for 3 years; Post-Doc dependent on
age and status, gross salary in the ﬁrst year about CHF
70’000, for 2-3 years.

sive species and the (re)emergence of vector-borne dis-
eases in the temperate-zone countries such as Belgium.
The MODIRISK project, in place for 2 years, have pro-vided data on the distribution of endemic and inva-
sive mosquitoes in Belgium. In that context, an exotic
species was identiﬁed in a single place, without imme-
diate danger of diseases transmission. However, com-
plementary analyses are planed.
The aim of this postdoc study is to determine the po-
tential risks for human being. Trophic preferences will
be evaluate by sequencing PCR products of the cy-
tochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA from blood
fed mosquitoes. Detection of virus from ﬁeld-collected
mosquitoes, and avian samples will be done by a Re-
verse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay.
Field population analyses will be also perform.
Missions -Demographic surveillance of the invasive
species populations -Determination of the trophic
preferences of three mosquitoes species (Ochlerotatus
japonicus, Anopheles plumbeus, Culex pipiens) (PCR
assay) -Determination of the infectious status of the
three species (RT-PCR assay). -Study about larval
competition of the invasive species

Postdoc-position available at the Department of Evolu-
tionary biology, Uppsala University
A postdoctoral research position in Evolutionary Ge-
netics/genomics is available at the Department of Evo-
lutionary Biology at Uppsala University. This postdoc
will be in the research-group of Dr Hanna Johannes-
son and oﬀers an opportunity to explore a wide range
of evolutionary paradigms, from the genomic conse-
quences of selﬁng vs outcrossing, to the early steps in
the evolution of sex chromosomes.
Our research group uses the ﬁlamentous ascomycete
genus Neurospora as a model system. Neurospora is
well suited for studies on reproductive systems since its
closely related species exhibit a wide spectrum of re-
productive behavior. Furthermore, we use the mating-
type chromosome of Neurospora tetrasperma as a sim-
ple, general, model for studies of the early evolution of
sex chromosomes from autosomes. It shares features
with the complex sex chromosomes found in the ani-
mal and plant kingdom, but is not aﬀected by complex
sex-biased evolutionary forces such as sexual selection
and male biased mutation rate.
The postdoc-project can be developed after the inter-
est of the applicant, but should preferably involve large
scale SNP-typing and/ or high throughput sequencing
of natural populations of Neurospora.
The Program in Evolutionary Biology ( http://-
www.egs.uu.se/evbiol/ index.html) is situated in the
Evolutionary Biology Centre in central Uppsala. The
working atmosphere is international with English as
working language. The Evolutionary Biology Centre
constitutes an exciting arena for multidisciplinary re-
search in evolutionary biology in a broad sense, with
research programs including ecology, systematics, ge-
netics, genomics, and developmental biology.
Uppsala University is the oldest university in Scandi-
navia and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town
with beautiful surroundings conveniently situated 40
minutes with train from Stockholm.
Required qualiﬁcations for applicants are 1) a PhD in
Biology, Genetics, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology
or related ﬁeld, 2) experience in one or several of the
following areas: bioinformatics, population genetics,
evolutionary biology, genetics, microbiology, mycology,April 1, 2009 EvolDir 99
and 3) demonstrated communication skills in English.
The position is for two years, and will imply full salary.
Start date ASAP. Review of applications will begin im-
mediately and continue until the position is ﬁlled.

Institutions: Canadian Institute for Advanced Re-
search, Program in Integrated Microbial Biodiversity;
Department of Biology, University of Victoria; De-
partments of Zoology & Botany, University of British
Columbia.
Starting date and duration: The appointment may be-
gin as early as July 15, 2009. The successful applicant
will be appointed for 2-years.
Project description V Background
Symbioses between insects and microbes are ubiq-
uitous and far- reaching. Recently there has been
enormous interest in the ecology, evolution, and ge-
nomics of infectious microbes of insects; this work
has focused primarily on inherited bacterial sym-
bionts. There have been comparatively few stud-
ies on associations between insects and microbial eu-
karyotes. We are seeking a CIFAR-Integrated Mi-
crobial Biodiversity postdoctoral fellow who will work
on highly collaborative research between the labs of
Steve Perlman (ecology and evolution of insects and
their associates, web.uvic.ca/ ~stevep/) at U. Victoria,
and Patrick Keeling (protist genomics and evolution,
www.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/ ) at U. British Columbia.
The goal of this research is to make exciting advances
in the area of insect-protist associations.
Possible research avenues:
Molecular approaches to the study of microsporidian
male-killers V Diverse inherited microbes of insects in-
crease their transmission by manipulating their hosts
reproduction. One common manipulation is to kill male
hosts, and this has evolved independently numerous
times in bacteria, and at least once in microsporidians
infecting mosquitoes. Microsporidian male-killers have
received much less attention, and they are unusual in
that they kill their hosts late in larval development,
just before male mosquitoes pupate and emerge from
the water as adults. Male-killing coincides with the re-
lease of massive amounts of spores that are infectious
to copepods, and thus represents the outcome of a de-
velopmental switch V infectious transmission in maleApril 1, 2009 EvolDir 101
hosts versus maternal transmission in females. Lit-
tle is known about the mechanism of male-killing, or
whether and how microsporidians recognize host sex.
This project proposes to address this question by using
subtractive hybridization, rtPCR, and ESTs to screen
for microsporidian genes with sex-speciﬁc expression.
Evolution of Drosophila-protist associations V Surpris-
ingly little is known about microbial eukaryotes infect-
ing Drosophila. This project aims to a) character-
ize novel infections by screening natural populations
of Drosophila for infectious protists, particularly mi-
crosporidia, yeasts, trypanosomes, and gregarines; b)
measure the eﬀects of infection on host ﬁtness; c) de-
termine how infections alter the expression of immune
and stress response genes, and d) test whether inher-
ited bacterial endosymbionts (e.g. Wolbachia) aﬀect
resistance to infection. Application package:
A complete application package includes a CV (includ-
ing list of publications), a brief (1-page) statement of re-
search interests, and the names and e-mail addresses of
3-4 referees (at least 3 of which are not CIFAR program
members). Applications must be received by March
31, 2009. Send application to: Dr. Steve Perlman

PhD Summer School 2009
“Interactions between ecological and evolutionary pro-

will be held in July 5th-18th, 2009, at Eawag Kas-
tanienbaum, Switzerland
Now all 6 invited lecturers are assigned: Prof. James
Elser (Arizona State University) Prof. Nelson Hairston
(Cornell University) Prof. Eric Triplett (University
of Florida) Prof. Andrew Hendry (McGill Univer-
sity) Prof. Elena Litchman (Michigan State University)
Prof. Luc De Meester (K. U. Leuven)
The course will confront selected PhD students with the
challenge of integrating ecosystems ecology and evolu-
tionary biology, arguably the least well-integrated pair
of disciplines in ecology. Some have described this chal-
lenge as the last missing synthesis in ecology. We will
take a multidisciplinary look at lake ecology, ask how
nutrient ﬂuxes shape microbial and algal activity and
diversity, how these in turn exert ecological and evolu-
tionary pressure on organisms at higher trophic levels,
and lastly, how adaptive evolution at higher trophic
levels exerts ecological pressures at lower levels that
possibly change ecosystem dynamics. The 2009 course
will be built around diﬀerent aspects of ecological stoi-
chiomentry.The Summer School course will be held at Eawag Kas-
tanienbaum, near Lucerne, in Switzerland. Eawag is
the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Tech-
nology, and the Kastanienbaum Centre for Ecology,

Evolutionary Biology Workshop in the Alps
La Fouly, Switzerland, 20-26 June 2009
We are still accepting applications until the end of this
week. This is a graduate course based on a concept
developed by Steve Stearns and John Maynard Smith.
Target participants are advanced master students and
students in the ﬁrst half of their PhD. Taking place in
a beautiful small Alpine village (La Fouly), it will allow
you to focus while being able to enjoy the landscape and
the Alpine ﬂora. The goals are to develop the following
skills:
* developing your scientiﬁc ideas through discussions
in groups; * thinking critically and expressing oneself
clearly; * turning a general idea into a research project;
* discovering the many layers of a scientiﬁc project:
digging deep; * writing a grant proposal and defending
it; * interacting with the faculty in an informal setting
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will work with *your* ideas, you will de-
cide yourself what the important questions in broadly
deﬁned evolutionary biology are, you will choose one,
and propose a research project that will address it. Thefaculty will visit the groups during the discussions to
answer your questions and provide coaching and they
will give you feedback on your proposal, but they will
generally take the back seat. Additionally, the fac-
ulty will give informal talks about their research and
be available for informal discussion. The language of
the course is English.
Faculty: Mark Kirkpatrick (University of Texas,
Austin), John Taylor (University of California, Berke-
ley), Ian Sanders and Tad Kawecki (both University of
Lausanne, Switzerland).
Costs: there is no tuition fee; the participants will cover
the costs of room and board (approximately CHF 420.-
).
For more information see http://www.unil.ch/ee/-

LakeheadU AncientDNA May11-29
Time is running out! Register now!
Once again, the Paleo-DNA Laboratory at Lakehead
University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada is oﬀering
students the opportunity to participate in our Ancient
DNA Training Program. This year we are delivering
the program from May 11-29, 2009.
During the program, students work in small groups (one
instructor to 4 students) and are given a project de-
pending upon their interests. This may be genetic anal-ysis of disease in ancient mummies or forensic proﬁling
of a body or many other such projects. As a student,
you will learn diﬀerent extraction methods to compare
and contrast on both your own DNA and other sam-
ples. You will generate your own DNA proﬁle, deter-
mine your own mitochondrial haplogroup/haplotype,
your own STR proﬁle, conﬁrm your own sex genetically
and evaluate a great new forensic technique known as
DNA Witness or identify your ancestry by DNA.
Students will learn about the diﬀerent types of DNA
that can be analyzed: mitochondrial, nuclear, chloro-
plast and pathogenic DNA. You will be taught diﬀer-
ent methods of analysis PCR-RFLP, multiplex PCR,
sequencing, regular PCR and electrophoresis. You will
learn diﬀerent methods of sample preparation from a
number of diﬀerent tissue types like bone, teeth, hair,
blood residues and mummiﬁed tissue.
Students will understand the use of genetic analysis and
its potential in archaeozoology, palaeopathology, ar-
chaeology, forensic science, palaeobotany and palaeon-
tology. Lectures by professors and experts in the ﬁelds
of archaeology, genetics, ancient DNA, forensic science,
palaeopathology and more are integrated with the lab-
oratory sessions.
Attached to this email is the 2009 Ancient DNA
Training Program Poster. We would appreciate
it if you would display the poster in a promi-
nent location, targeted speciﬁcally at anthropology,
biology, bio-molecular and chemistry students. If
you would like registration forms or further in-
formation, please visit our website at <http://-

COURSE OBJECTIVES. - ANT COURSE is designed
for systematists, ecologists, behaviorists, conserva-
tion biologists, and other biologists whose research
responsibilities require a greater understanding of ant
taxonomy and ﬁeld research techniques. Emphasis
is on the identiﬁcation of the ant genera and species
occurring in North America. Lectures will include
background information on the ecology, life histories
and evolution of ants. Field trips are structured
to teach collecting and sampling techniques, and
associated lab work provides instruction on specimen
preparation, sorting and labeling. Information on
equipment/supply vendors, literature, and myrmeco-
logical contacts are also presented.
COURSE SIGNIFICANCE. - Ant Course is a unique
opportunity to acquire training that is unavailable else-
where. This course will provide students with 1) the
conﬁdence and skills to identify the ant genera of North
America; 2) an understanding of modern specimen pro-
cessing and curation techniques; 3) an appreciation for
the biological diversity of ants, and 4) experience keying
to the species level.
SPONSORS. -California Academy of Sciences and Mu-
seum of Comparative Zoology, with funding in part
from National Science Foundation.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION. - ANT COURSE
will be taught from August 6 - 16, 2009 at the South-
western Research Station (SWRS) in Portal Arizona
(http://research.amnh.org/swrs/ ). The Station is cen-
tered amid the richest ant fauna in North America.
This is an ongoing course, oﬀered annually.
PARTICIPANT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. - ANT
COURSE is open to all interested individuals. Priority
will be given to those students for whom the course will
have a signiﬁcant impact on their research with ants.
An entomological background is not required. We aim
to include students with a diverse interest in biology,
including ant systematics, ecology, behavioral biology,
genetics, and conservation. The high instructor to stu-
dent ratio will allow students to receive individual at-
tention. ANT COURSE is presented in English and
limited to 30 participants
COSTS. - Tuition for the 10-day COURSE is $475 for
current students and $675 for non-students. In addi-
tion, the Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) fee
for this period, covering dormitory room and board, is
$600. Transportation costs between home and Tucson
(air) or SWRS (auto) are to be borne by all partici-
pants.110 EvolDir April 1, 2009
FELLOWSHIPS. - Four fellowships are available for
2009. Two fellowships cover tuition fees and two fel-
lowships cover station fees. Foreign students may apply
for additional fellowships to assist in travel. Those in-
terested in attending the course should seek all possible
avenues to secure funding for the course. You should
only apply for the Ant Course fellowship if you can not
ﬁnd other support and it is essential for your partici-
pation in the course. Beware that if you apply for an
ant course fellowship it implies that fellowship funding
is essential to your participation in the course. Thus,
if you are not selected for a fellowship, you might not
be accepted into the course. Please notify the course if
your funding request status changes before the applica-
tion due date.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
