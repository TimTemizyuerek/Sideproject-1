EVOLUTION2016 SPOTLIGHT SESSIONS Reminder-
Application deadline is Apr. 30
Thisyear we are introducing a new way to give an oral
presentation at the annual 'Evolution meetings': SPOT-
LIGHT SESSIONS.4 EvolDir April 1, 2016
EachSpotlight Session will focus on an intellectually co-
hesive theme (see below), providing an excellent venue
to present your research to a relevant and highly engaged
audience. If your work falls within one of the themes,
we strongly encourage you to apply to participate in
the appropriate Spotlight session as it will include other
speakers and audience members that are most interested
in your work. Session organizers are now accepting ap-
plications. Session organizers are leaders in their eld
and have been asked to select presentations to create an
intellectually stimulating session while ensuring speakers
reect diversity (including gender and career stage, i.e.,
grads + pdfs SHOULD APPLY).There is no cost/risk
to applying as individuals can (and should) also register
to give a standard talk in case they are not selected to
participate in the Spotlight Session. Selection is com-
petitive and for chosen speakers it will make a great
addition to your CV.
Thedeadline for applications to all three Spotlight Ses-
sions is Apr. 30 (coinciding with the end of early meeting
registration). This years Spotlight Sessions are:
1)The evolution of species interactions Organiz-
ers:M.C. Stoddard (Harvard), Marjorie Weber (UC
Davis/Michigan State) and Jesse R. Lasky (Penn State)
Applications to: jrl35@psu.edu
2)Next generation phylogenetic inference Organiz-
ers:Erick Matsen (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center), Tracey Heath (Iowa State), and Felipe Za-
pata (San Francisco State) Applications to: mat-
sen@fredhutch.org
3)Understanding history and process in rapid diversi-
cation with genomic data Organizer:KatieWagner (U
Wyoming) Applicationsto: cwagne22@uwyo.edu
Learnmore about the themes of the Spotlight Sessions:
http://www.evolutionmeetings.org/special-talks.html
APPLICATIONINFORMATION ASpotlight Session
consists of one 28 min, ve 13 min, and twelve5 min
('lightning') talks. If you are interested in speaking
in a Spotlight Session please submit an application to
the appropriate organizer (emails above). The applica-
tion must include: (1) Name, (2) institution, (3) rank
(e.g., student, pdf, faculty), (4) names & institutions
of co-authors, (5) a short abstract (max: 300 words),
and (6) which talk types you are willing to give (28,
13, or 5; the more exible you are the more likely you
are to be selected). Applications must be received by
April 30, 2016. No nancial support is provided to se-
lected speakers (i.e., speakers must pay their own travel,
accommodation, registration, etc.).
Youmay still register to give a standard or lightning talk
in a regular 'open session' atthe meetings even if you ap-ply to participate in a Spotlight Session, and you should
do so if you want to ensure that you can give a talk.
However, if you are selected to speak in the spotlight
session you will have to choose which talk slot to use as
each attendee is allowed to give only one oral presenta-
tion. Spotlight sessions are committed to representing
diversity. All interestedindividuals are encouraged to
apply.

\Welcome, on behalf of the Organizing Committee, to
members of the International Society for Subterranean
Biology, all speleobiologists, and anyone interested in
subterranean life. The 23rd International Conference
on Subterranean Biology, jointly sponsored by the De-
partment of Biology at the University of Arkansas, will
be held in Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA, from June 13 to
June 17, 2016. This will be the rst ICSB held in the
United States, and we are eager to showcase the many
caves and karst features in the area and to bring together
scientists and students with an interest in subterranean
biology from the U.S. and from around the globe. These
meetings often have participants from more than 20
countries, and we hope to break that record in 2016.
In addition to contributed papers and poster sessions,
several special symposia on topics such as evolution and
development as well as conservation are being planned.
The meeting itself will be hosted on the campus of the
University of Arkansas. A number of special events
are also being planned, including a day long excursion
and several receptions. As more information becomes
available, we will post it on this website. Please stay
tuned.

I am trying to attract evolutionary biologists to the
GRS.
Thank you, Emily
Dear colleagues, We would like to attract evolutionary
biologists to submit are abstracts to our interdisciplinary
Gordon Research Seminar associated with the Global
Ocean Change Biology Gordon Research Conference.
The seminar will be held on July 16-17 in Waterville
Valley, NH and is open to graduate students, post-docs,
and early career scientists.
Specically, we are interested in presentations from evo-
lutionary biologists studying local adaptation, rapid evo-
lution, and transgenerational plasticity in the context
of natural environmental variability and global oceanchange.
*Understanding the Biological Consequences of Global
Ocean Change: Insights from Environmental History*
The focus of this meeting is to bring together our un-
derstanding about how the environmental history of
a population or individual inuences tolerance or vul-
nerability to future environmental change and thus the
ability for marine species to cope with the multi-stressor
scenario of global ocean change. We are interested in
studies that span a wide range of time scales (from
carryover eects within an individual's lifetime to trans-
generational plasticity to population level timescales
to pale oceanographic time scales), and we are also
looking to highlight interdisciplinary tools for linking
environmental exposure to organismal performance.
To submit an abstract for an oral or poster presenta-
tion and to nd out more information, go to https://-
www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=17217 For full consid-
eration, please *submit your abstracts by April 15.*
Please contact Seminar chair Emily Rivest at ebrivest

UBraunschweig Adaptation
Adaptation in nature \from ecology to genomes Envi-
ronmental conditions change constantly and individuals
have to adapt in order to persist. Adaptation therefore
plays a central role in evolutionary processes. How-
ever, there are considerable gaps between ecological
and genetic perspectives on adaptive evolution. Despite
revolutionary changes in data acquisition in molecular
biology, our current knowledge about trait evolution
in natural systems is scarce. A holistic view on evo-
lutionary processes is typically hampered by a lack of
knowledge about the threads connecting molecular ge-April 1, 2016 EvolDir 11
netic traits with higher-level phenotypes. Filling these
gaps has been considered a key challenge for biologists
of the 21st century.
Research towards these goals must be highly integrative
and cover results from organismal biology as well as
molecular biology. The summer school "Adaptation in
nature\ from ecology to genomes" from September 27th
- 28th 2016, held at the Technische Universit at Braun-
schweig, brings together scientists and students studying
adaption in natural systems. It is a joint meeting of
the Society of Genetics together with the DIP research
unit (Gene expression underlying parallel habitat adap-
tation in salamanders) funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG) organized by Sebastian Steinfartz
(Braunschweig) and Arne Nolte (Oldenburg). The meet-
ing covers a broad range of topics in the context of
adaptation, such as convergent and parallel evolution,
phenotypic plasticity, ancient adaptation, the ecological
context of evolutionary processes and adaptive radia-
tions. It is the goal of the meeting to highlight studies
that reveal the interplay between molecular evolution,
organismal biology and ecological conditions.
Format and registration: Selected invited speakers will
present their results, but abstracts for additional oral or
poster contributions can be submitted by email to Se-
bastian Steinfartz (s.steinfartz@tu-bs.de). An extended
poster session will be organized such that the presen-
tation of posters takes a prominent spot in the con-
ference schedule. If you are interested in joining the
meeting, please send an email to Sebastian Steinfartz
(s.steinfartz@tu-bs.de) before May 31st 2016. Further
details on the conference and registration will be sent
upon registration.
Awards: The GfG will award the Elisabeth-Gate-Preis
and Anders-Preis to outstanding young researchers dur-
ing the conference.
When: 2 days, Sept. 27th 9:00 am Sept. 28th 16:00 pm.
Where: Technische Universit at Braunschweig (Haupt-
geb aude).
Fee: Admission fee of 40 euro for members of the GfG
otherwise 80 euro. Admission for students is free. Pay-
ment details will be communicated upon ocial regis-
tration.
Conference Dinner: Location tba. Conference dinner
can be attended for a fee of 25 euro. Payment details
will be communicated upon registration.
Accomodation: Attendees are requested to book their

Title: Environmental stress adaptation in invertebrates
Research area and project description: Evolutionary
biology, ecophysiology and molecular biology
The successful applicant will participate in the Depart-
ment's work on evolution, ecophysiology and molecular
biology with emphasis on adaptation to thermal stress,
responses to thermal stress (acclimation and harden-
ing) and the molecular mechanisms underlying these
adaptive responses. The work includes studies of mem-
brane lipids, gene expression, protein expression andsequence analysis, but also whole-organism studies of
performance, mainly on the Drosophila model. Detailed
studies of stress responses have shown that organisms
have developed sophisticated physiological adaptations
to combat environmental stress.
The project aims to identify and investigate candidate
systems for studying thermal adaptation and responses.
For example, several investigations point to a connection
between thermal adaptation and genes associated with
vision and phototransduction. To achieve the aim of the
project a focus on molecular investigations combined
with information from population level and physiology
will be applied to achieve an integrated functional un-
derstanding.
The work will be done under the supervision of Assoc.
Prof. Jesper Givskov S ~Arensen (AU), supported by a
grant from Aarhus University Research Foundation.
Qualications and specic competences: A Master's
degree in Bioscience, Biotechnology or similar or a bach-
elor's degree in a relevant subject are possible back-
grounds. A strong interest in experimental as well as
analytical work and the ability to communicate scientic
work is required. Experience with the model organism14 EvolDir April 1, 2016
Drosophila or alternatively other insect species is an
advantage.
Place of Employment and Place of Work: The place of
employment is Department of Bioscience, Aarhus Uni-
versity, Denmark, and the place of work is the section

BuenosAires AvianSpeciation
*Ph.D. fellowship*
*Project title:* Phylogenomic analysis of incipient
Neotropical birds: studying the contribution of selection
in the speciation process
*Institution*: Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales
Bernardino Rivadavia, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
*Director:* Dr. Dar ^A^Ao Lijtmaer
(www.researchgate.net/prole/Dario Lijtmaer).
*Description of the Ph.D. project:* The general project
consists in the study of the speciation process in Neotrop-
ical birds and the role of selection. Within this general
project, the Ph.D. project in particular is to analyze the
recent radiation of the southern capuchinos, a group of
8 sympatric species of passerines belonging to the genus
*Sporophila* that are still undergoing the speciation
process. These species dier in their coloration and
vocalizations, but do not show dierences in their neu-
tral DNA (due to their recent divergence and likely also
hybridization). This suggests that selection (natural
and/or sexual) is having a relevant role in the speciation
process. Based on the study of the complete genome of
some of these species we will identify areas that suggest
the presence of speciation genes and they will be stud-
ied from a functional perspective. On the other hand,
behavioral analyses will be performed to study homo-
vs heterospecic recognition and the sexual characters
used for mate choice, studying the possible role of sexual

PlantMicrobeCoevolution
Graduate position in Plant-Microbe Interactions:
In the Group of Plant Nutrition at ETH Zurich in
Switzerland we combine basic research on mechanisms
driving and mediating plant nutrition with eld trials
to solve topical problems in plant production. In the
multidisciplinary team, we are recruiting a motivated
PhD student for a project that combines community eco-
logical analyses of microbial root symbionts with plant
physiological ecological analyses to mechanistically elu-
cidate microbe-plant-soil feedbacks. Specically, the
PhD student will address soil constraints to sustain-
able plant production, in a project entitled ^ aEcological
intensication of organic rooibos cultivation in South
Africa (EcoInt)'. Root-associated microbes are powerful
mediators of plant nutrition and health and for this
they are increasingly considered promising for farming
on marginal land. The collaborative research project
with Stellenbosch University and various stakeholders
in South Africa has the goal to establish a knowledge
base on suspected declines of benecial and accumula-
tion of antagonistic microbes, which are thought to be
responsible for yield declines in monospecic and long-
term cultivation of Rooibos tea, Aspalathus linearis, a
legume bush endemic to South-Africa. The research
will also engage producers to test promising methods of
raising on-farm biological soil fertility. The PhD student
will nd out what aspects of root-associated microbial
communities (composition, structure, or abundance) is
determinant for the tea bushes' growth, health, and tol-
erance against drought. This will be done by combining
data of molecular barcoding analyses on rhizobia (R),
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and oomycetes (O)April 1, 2016 EvolDir 15
and measurements on isotopic and total nutrient and
water status indicators of leaf samples (12/13C, 14/15N,
Mn, 16/18O, P). Based on i) a eld survey in remain-
ing wild stands, prospering and declining plantations,
and ii) nursery-type common garden experiments with
dierent soil origins and organic fertilizer amendments,
as well as, iii) interviews with small- and large-scale
farmers, the following main research questions are to be
addressed: 1) Is plant performance related to consistent
patterns of community composition, structure, and over-
all abundance of AMF, O, and/or R? 2) Are nursery
seedlings healthier when raised in soil from remaining
semi-natural vegetation patches, because of more bal-
anced and mutualist-rich root-associated microbial com-
munities? 3) Can natural nutrient ushes be replaced
by application of mulch, dung and/or compost? Linking
observations with data from experimental manipula-
tion has good potential to reveal mechanistic linkages
between complex interactions between microbes, physic-
ochemical soil properties and plant performance. Such
process-based knowledge is needed to identify opportu-
nities for agronomic intervention to ^ aintensify' advan-
tageous microbe-root interactions for sustaining yields
with little use of external resources. Highly motivated
students with an excellent academic track record are
encouraged to apply. Applicants should be willing to
travel internationally and work under remote and harsh
environmental conditions. Preference will be given to
candidates with demonstrated (international publica-
tions) and broad interests in ecology, evolutionary biol-
ogy, microbial ecology and application of related knowl-
edge. Desirable skills include experience in working with
next generation DNA sequencing data (metagenomics),
including associated bioinformatics analyses, and use
of natural abundances of stable isotopes. The success-
ful applicant will also be required to interview local
farmers in a socio-economic component of the project.
Requirements include an MSc in plant science (environ-
mental or agricultural sciences) or (microbial) ecology,
good spoken and written English, and a driver's license.
Funding is guaranteed for three years by the collabo-
ration between the Mercator Research Foundation and

QuantitativePopulationGenetics
Dear colleagues,
The Centre for Statistics at the Georg-August-University
Goettingen in Germany, is currently inviting applica-
tions for a
PhD Position in Genetic Modelling of Complex Traits
(75 % E 13 TV-L)
within the Research Training Group (RTG) 1644 'Scal-
ing Problems in Statistics', starting October 1, 2016.
The position is funded by the German Research Foun-
dation (DFG) for 3 years.
The remuneration is equivalent to 75 per cent of a post-
doc position in the German system.
The highly interdisciplinary Research Training Group
aims to solve current questions in the areas of agricul-
tural economics, ecology, econometrics, genetics, and
remote sensing by means of statistical methods, and at
the development thereof. It distinguishes itself through
joint supervision and a structured study program con-
sisting of methodologically oriented lectures, interdis-
ciplinary research seminars, and skills courses, as well
as including a career enhancement program for female
PhD students.
The Research Training Group involves working groups
from agroecology, agricultural economics and rural de-
velopment, animal breeding and genetics, ecosystem
modelling, forest inventory and remote sensing, genetic
epidemiology, statistics and econometrics. For more
information, visit www.uni-goettingen.de/rtg1644. The
advertised position is located at the Animal Breeding
and Genetics Group with Prof. Dr. Henner Simianer.
The research project will be on 'Dissecting intraspe-
cic variation in compound eye size in Drosophila16 EvolDir April 1, 2016
melanogaster via integration of genome, transcriptome
and phenotype data'. While the evolution of simple
morphological traits is well-understood, our knowledge
about how the size and shape of complex organs evolve
is still limited. The successful PhD candidate will ad-
dress this question by analysing the genetic basis of eye
size variation in various inbred strains of the Drosophila
melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). For all
DGRP lines genome sequences are available. For rep-
resentative strains, developmental transcriptome data
using RNAseq will be generated so that data across sev-
eral scales (genome, transcriptome, phenotype) can be
integrated. Similar data will be generated for articial
selection experiments based on a subset of the DGRP
y lines. The successful candidate will work in an inter-
disciplinary team at the Department of Animal Sciences
(Prof. Dr. Henner Simianer) and the Department of
Developmental Biology (Dr. Nico Posnien) as well as
during an extended research stay in the group of one of
the international collaborators overseas.
For more details, visit www.uni-goettingen.de/rtg1644/-
jobs . By the time of appointment, the successful can-
didate will already have completed a M.Sc. degree or
equivalent in biology, statistics, mathematics or bioin-
formatics. A solid background in statistics and quantita-
tive genetics and a natural curiosity for basic biological
questions is required. Prior experience with Drosophila
genetics, population genetics and/ or basic program-
ming skills is benecial. You should show a high degree
of independence in experimental planning and the struc-
tured analysis of large datasets. Very good knowledge
of English is required.
The Georg-August-University is an equal opportunities
employer and places particular emphasis on fostering
career opportunities for women. Qualied women are
therefore strongly encouraged to apply as they are un-
derrepresented in this eld.
The University rmly intends to raise the number of
disabled persons in its employment. In the case of
equally qualied applicants, disabled persons will be
preferentially considered.

EvolutionaryConvergence
Funded PhD project : History of an evolutionary con-
vergence : evolution of chemical defenses within mimetic
butteries communities.
The Labex BcDIV funds a PhD for 3 years on the
evolution of chemical defenses in neo-tropical butteries.
This PhD project will be located in the Mus eum Na-
tional d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris (France) and jointly
supervised by Violaine Llaurens (CNRS researcher,
isyeb.mnhn.fr/annuaire-et-pages-personnelles/pages-
personnelles/LLAURENS-Vio laine) and Bastien Nay
(CNRS research director, naygroup.wordpress.com), in
collaboration with Marianne Elias (CNRS researcher,
isyeb.mnhn.fr/annuaire-et-pages-personnelles/pages-
personnelles/ELIAS-Marian ne,279). We are seeking a
highly motivated student with a chemical ecology prole
to work on this interdisciplinary project combining
natural product chemistry and evolutionary biology.
Scientic context :
Many toxic butteries display vivid wing colour pat-
tern, used as a warning signal by predators. Evolu-
tionary convergences in these wing colour patterns are
frequently observed among distantly related species,
creating 'mimicry rings' of buttery species displaying
similar colour patterns. The more individuals and/or
species share the same warning signal, the more ef-
ciently the signal is recognized by predators, which
suer from the eect of the chemical defenses carried by
butteries. The evolution of chemical defenses within
Lepidoptera lineages therefore plays an important role
in the evolutionary convergence of mimetic colour pat-
tern. Chemical defenses can be sequestered from food
or been neo-synthetized by butteries, and may exhibit
large variations within and among species. In turn,
those variations have important consequences on preda-
tors' behaviour and on the dynamics of mimetic signal.
This PhD project focuses on two highly divergent neo-
tropical clades of mimetic butteries (split circa. 90
million years ago), namely the sub-tribes Heliconiini
and Ithomiini. In these two clades, chemical defenses
are acquired through dierent routes, but some species
display strikingly similar wing colour patterns. In Heli-
coniini, toxicity stems from cyanogenic glucosides stored
at larval stage from Passiora host plants, or can be
neosynthesized by butteries themselves. However, inIthomiini, toxicity relies on pyrrolizidic alkalo ds, se-
questered at adult stage from Asteraceae, Boraginaceae,
and Apocynaceae owers. The dierence in plants from
which toxins might be stored, together with the vari-
ations in the neosynthesis capabilities, and stage of
acquisition suggests contrasted evolution of chemical
defenses in the two clades. Furthermore, species within
these two clades also dier in their behavior and ecology,
e.g. can have gregarious or solitary larval stages, and
various abundances of their mimicry rings and level of
conspicuousness of the associated signal. These traits
can also be inuenced by other selective forces, there-
fore may intervene in the evolution of chemical defenses.
This PhD project aims at qualitatively and quantita-
tively analysing variations in chemical compounds in
dierent species of the two clades and characterizing
their metabolic origin to understand the evolution of
chemical defenses in those two mimetic clades.
Prole :
We are looking for a student with a Master degree in
chemical ecology or natural product chemistry. A spe-
cic interest in macro-evolutionary questions would be
appreciated. The student should be able to perform
chemical analyses on biological material using various
innovative analytical techniques. Together with those
lab skills, the student should display a high motivation
for eldwork in tropical areas.
Schedule :
The PhD thesis will start in October 2016. Application
les should contain: a CV, a cover letter, Master score
sheets, and two recommendation letters. Complete ap-
plication les must be sent to llaurens@mnhn.fr and
bnay@mnhn.fr before March 30th. Selected candidates
will then be interviewed by a selection committee in
May. The PhD will start on October 1st, 2016.

Project Description:
Understanding the process of rapid adaptation to novel
environments is imperative for successful prediction of
future adaptive responses to both long- and short-term
environmental change.
This project makes use of *Arabidopsis thaliana* popula-
tion samples we collected from the Cape Verde Islands,
which lie at the margin of the species range. Plants
growing here experience a long and severe dry season,
which places strong selective pressures on growth and
reproductive timing. For example, key traits include
drought tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and timing of
germination and owering.
The student will combine results of trait mapping stud-
ies with Illumina and PacBio sequence data to model the
evolutionary history of Arabidopsis in the Cape Verde
Islands.
Research Environment:
Research in the Hancock Lab is funded by the Euro-
pean Research Council (ERC) and Max Planck Institute
(MPI) and focuses on understanding the molecular basis
of evolutionary processes. For more information about
work in the lab, see http://www.mpipz.mpg.de/hancock
Our group is housed within the Max Planck Institute
of Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ), a world-class re-
search center, located in the Green Belt of Cologne, Ger-
many. The Institute houses 25 research groups, its own

This project makes use of *Arabidopsis thaliana* popu-lation samples we collected from the Cape Verde Islands,
which lie at the margin of the species range. Plants grow-
ing here experience a long and severe dry season, which
places strong selective pressures on growth and repro-
ductive timing. For example, key traits include drought
tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and timing of germina-
tion and owering. The PhD student working on this
project will dissect the molecular basis of adaptation to
this extreme environment.
The project combines trait mapping in natural and
recombinant populations, functional genetic analysis, in-
cluding the application of CRISPR/Cas9 editing, bioin-
formatics, and population genetics. In addition, an
interested student will have the opportunity to partici-
pate in ongoing eldwork in the Cape Verde Islands.
Research Environment:
Research in the Hancock Lab is funded by the Euro-
pean Research Council (ERC) and Max Planck Institute
(MPI) and focuses on understanding the molecular basis
of evolutionary processes. For more information about
work in the lab, see http://www.mpipz.mpg.de/hancock

Rosco EvolutionParasitism
PhD Fellowship
Project Title: The paradox of being a specialist for a
parasite of marine blooming dinoagellates

see more details on the project: http://www.sb-
rosco.fr/en/2016/03/17/open-phd-position-rosco-
france-dipo-team Description: The parasitism is a
frequent lifestyle in nature and a major source of
evolutionary pressure for both the host and the parasite.
Given the ubiquity of host-parasite interactions,
understanding the factors that generate, maintain,
and constrain these associations is of primary interest
with implications for a wide range of ecological issues,
including dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and
invasions (Daszak et al. 2000, Keane and Crawley
2002). Although little studied, many extremely virulent
microeukaryotic parasites infecting microalgae have
been detected in the marine plankton. Among them
are Syndiniales, which constitute a diverse and highly
widespread group (Guillou et al. 2008). Because of
their virulence and abundant ospring, such parasites
have the potential to control dinoagellate populations,
and therefore toxic microalgal blooms (Alves de Souza
et al. 2015). These parasites usually exhibit a narrow
host spectrum (Chambouvet et al. 2008). Such
specialization strongly relies on the life-history traits
and ecology of the host. However, coastal planktonic
ecosystems are by nature characterized by strong
environmental uctuations and rapid turnovers, even at
the population level (Dia et al. 2014). Considering the
short generation time and the high dispersal capacity of
microalgae, their parasites must adapt at a signicantlyfaster rate than for larger hosts (e.g. plants or animals).
All of these considerations should theoretically lead
to the natural selection of generalist parasites at the
expense of specialists. The persistence and ecological
success of specialists among marine planktonic parasites
is thus an intriguing paradox.
We hypothesise that host specialization is constrained
by evolutionary processes underlying key steps during
the infection (such as penetration inside the host and the
takeover of the host). We will explore this hypothesis
at the cellular level, using molecular approaches

The Senckenberg Gesellschaft f ur Naturforschung (SGN)
is a member institution of the Leibniz Association. With
almost 800 employees and its headquarters in Frankfurt
am Main, Senckenberg conducts natural history research
with research institutions in six federal states of Ger-
many. As an interdisciplinary institute, the Sencken-
berg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F)
focuses on the interactions between biodiversity and
climate.
A cooperative project conducted at the Senckenberg
Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (Frankfurt
am Main), the University of Mainz and the University
of W urzburg jointly invites applications for a
PhD position \Evolution, genetic basis and behavioural
consequences of cuticular hydrocarbon proles in para-
biotic ants" (65%)
Insect cuticles are covered with cuticular hydrocarbons
(CHC), which serve two important functions: as des-
iccation barrier and as cues and signals for chemical26 EvolDir April 1, 2016
communication. Despite their high importance, the
evolution of CHC proles, the underlying genetic mech-
anisms and the role of specic CHC traits for intra- and
interspecic recognition are still poorly understood. As a
model system, we will use two parabiotically associated,
tropical ant species, Crematogaster levior and Cam-
ponotus femoratus, which show unusually high chemical
diversity.
In this project the PhD candidate will mainly focus on
the genomic basis of CHC evolution. The candidate will
assemble the genome, and investigate the population
structure of dierent chemotypes of Crematogaster lev-
ior in French Guiana, using state-of-the-art population
genomic tools (PoolSeq). In addition, the candidate will
use the obtained information on the distribution and
diversication of the chemotypes to test and verify the
importance of specic CHC compounds and compound
mixtures in intra- and interspecic behavioural essays
in the eld.
The project will be conducted in close collaboration
with a second PhD student based at the Universities of
Mainz and W urzburg, who will mainly focus on the CHC
composition, the identication of candidate genes via
transcriptome analyses and their functional verication
using RNAi knockouts. Both students will conduct eld
work in French Guiana, some of the experiments and
parts of the analyses together. Therefore, the candidate
is expected to work independently within the project
framework, but also be a good team worker.
Your prole:
- Master's/diploma in biology, environmental sciences
or bioinformatics. - Strong interest in evolutionary
biology, ecology and genetics. - High motivation to
link eld-, experimental- and lab work with bioinfor-
matics. - Excellent communication skills in English -
Programming skills or bioinformatics are important, but
optional plus points - The PhD position is funded for
three years by the German Science Foundation. Within
these three years the PhD student is expected to nish
her/his degree. Salary and benets are in accordance
with a public service position in Germany (TV-H E 13,

Zoology, Stockholm University. Closing date: 17 April
2016.
The Department of Zoology consists of ve divisions:
Ecology, Ethology, Functional Morphology, Population
Genetics, and Systematics and Evolution. The adver-
tised position will be part of the Division of Ethology.
There is a long-standing tradition for researchers at the
Division of Ethology to collaborate with researchers
from other elds, such as evolutionary ecology, theo-
retical evolutionary biology, and the study of cultural
evolution.
Project description We are seeking to recruit a PhD
student who will work within a multidisciplinary project
on brain evolution. The project uses the guppy (Poecilia
reticulata) as a model to experimentally test the possi-
bilities and consequences of evolving a more advanced
brain. More specically, the project addresses the evo-
lutionary costs and benets of intraspecic variation in
the relative size of separate brain regions. As such, the
project spans over multiple disciplines including articial
selection on brain anatomy, assays of individual and col-
lective behaviour, assays on dierent aspects of cognitive
ability, physiology, life histories, primary and secondary
sexual traits and analyses of the genetic architecture
that orchestrates changes in brain anatomy and cogni-
tive ability. The already existing selection lines of large-
and small-brained guppies will form the basis of the
project but a new selection experiment on the relative
size of a separate brain region will also be undertaken
followed by relevant assays of behaviour and physiology.
The overall aim of the project is thus to increase our
understanding of the association between brain anatomy
and behaviour, cognitive ability and physiology. The
work will mostly be lab-oriented but includes also the
possibility of temporary eld work on Trinidad. The
project will require hard work in the lab but at the same
time provide excellent opportunities for personal initia-
tives and development towards a successful academic
career. An important task will be to undertake labo-
rious selection experiments followed by the collection
and analysis of complex data in a way that controls
for the setup of replicated articial selection designs.The project is undertaken in the brand new tropical
freshwater sh labs in the Department of Zoology with
room for over 6,000 aquaria and several separate experi-
ment rooms with established assays of brain anatomy,
several dierent aspects of cognitive abilities, swimming
speed, personality, 2D and 3D analysis of individual and
collective behaviour, respirometry etc. The successful
candidate will be part of a dynamic team consisting
of Ethologists (Niclas Kolm group, Stockholm Univer-
sity), Physicists and Mathematicians (David Sumpter
group, Uppsala University), Information Technology
researchers (Kristiaan Pelckmans group, Uppsala Uni-
versity), and Evolutionary Geneticists (Judith Mank
group, University College London) in a multidisciplinary
project that investigates the association between brain
anatomy and behaviour through the development of new
methods in behavioural assays, brain imaging and anal-
ysis of the genetic background to phenotypic variation.
Qualication requirements To be qualied for research
studies in the program, the applicant must have com-
pleted a Master degree (or equivalent) or have passed
at least 120 hp (2 years) of biological studies, including
an approved independent project of at least 30 hp at
advanced level within Ethology, Zoology, Behavioural
Ecology, Evolutionary Biology or a related subject. Ap-
plicants who have in principle acquired the correspond-
ing competence in Sweden or in another country are
also qualied.We are looking in particular for candidates
with a strong interest in brain evolution, with excellent
analytical ability and experience from quantitative anal-
yses of behaviour and other traits of interest.
Selection Among qualied applicants, selection is made
according to the ability to prot from the studies. The
criteria to be used are properly documented competence
within the described research area, capabilities with
regards to speaking and writing in English, analytical
thinking, creativity, initiative, independence, and team
work performance. The applicants earlier experience
within the eld of research can be of relevance especially
when further documented by university courses, inde-
pendent research work, personal references, interview
and an application indicating the applicants motivation
in written form.
Terms of employment Doctoral students should primar-
ily devote themselves to their own education, but may
engage in teaching, research, and administration corre-
sponding to a maximum of 20 % of a full-time position.
Stockholm University strives to be a workplace free from
discrimination and with equal opportunities for all.

Tahiti MarineGenomics
*PhD position in marine genomics*
- Project title: Diversity and color variation in the pearl
oyster Pinctada margaritifera: characterisation of the
phenome, genome and epigenome.
- Location: Ifremer, Centre du Pacique, Vairao, Tahiti,
French Polynesia.
- Project description: The color diversity of marine
mollusks'shells has been intriguing both scientists and
non-scientists for a long time. Marine mollusks are
an important part of the ecosystem and are a major
economical resource in many countries. In French Poly-
nesia, the production of cultured pearls through the
aquaculture of Pinctada margaritifera represents the
second biggest economical resource of the country (the
rst being tourism). There is a growing interest in op-
timizing this aquaculture through the improvement of
the pearl quality, and the use of color-selected oysters
families to control the nal color of the pearl.
Previous investigations demonstrated a link between
the shell color of the donor oyster and the color of the
pearl subsequently harvested from the recipient oyster.
The environment (e.g. depth of cultivation) also has
an impact on the intensity of the color of the pearl
being produced. Despite these recent discoveries, the
molecular mechanisms involved in the expression of the
color phenotype, as well as the heterogeneity in the
distribution of the color phenotypes in wild populations
are still not understood.
In this context, we propose to investigate this question
using data at the genomic, transcriptomic and epige-
netic level, using individuals within cultivated and wild
populations. The student will mostly work with NGS
generated data, but the project also has an experimental
component (epigenetic aspects) and a eld component
to sample natural populations.
- Research environment: Ifremer (French Research In-
stitute for Exploitation of the Sea) contributes to the
knowledge of the ocean and their resources, through the
monitoring of marine and coastal environments and the
sustainable development of marine activities. Ifremerperforms targeted applied research to address the ques-
tions posed by society (climate change eects, marine
biodiversity, pollution prevention, seafood quality...).
The Ifremer Pacic Center (COP) is based in Vairao
in Tahiti, French Polynesia. With 40 agents mobilized
onsite, the French Polynesia Marine Resources (RMPF)
research team focuses on the sustainable development
of marine exploitation in French Polynesia. The largest
research project is linked to a partnership with the per-
liculture professionals in order to improve the quality of
cultured pearls, and study the adaptative response of the
pearl oyster facing changing environmental conditions
(temperature, ocean acidication, pollution).
The successful candidate will be integrated in a dynamic
and young joint research unit, the UMR 241 \EIO"
(Oceanian Island Ecosystems) gathering researchers
from Ifremer, UPF (University of French Polynesia),
IRD (French Research Institute for Development), and
ILM (Louis Malard?? Institute).
- Candidate's prole We encourage applications from
candidates with solid knowledge in at least two of the
following disciplines: population genetics, evolutionary
genetics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, genomics, tran-
scriptomics, epigenetics. Knowledge of the R language
is strongly advised, and other scripting languages (for
NGS pipelines implementation) are a plus.
- Application instructions: To apply, please send a moti-
vation statement describing your interests in applying
for the position, a resume, and contact details for at
least two references to Celine.Reisser@ifremer.fr before
the 1st June 2016. Interviews will be hold mid-June.

SymbiosisGenomeEvolution
The principles of symbiosis in prokaryotes
A fully-funded, four-year Ph.D. studentship in compu-
tational evolutionary genetics is available in the lab of
Dr. Tom Williams at the University of Bristol, UK.32 EvolDir April 1, 2016
Symbiosis \ evolutionary partnership between distinct
life forms " is one of the most important processes that
shapes the evolution of life on Earth, from the nutri-
tional endosymbionts of insects to the ancient origins of
mitochondria and chloroplasts. The rst steps towards
genomic integration in those ancient lineages are no
longer accessible to us, but there are contemporary sym-
bioses between Archaea and Bacteria \ much studied for
their ecological importance, but about whose evolution
very little is known " that promise to shed light on the
principles of prokaryotic symbiosis, today and in the
distant past.
In this project, the successful candidate will apply phy-
logenetic and comparative genomic methods to under-
stand the genomic mechanisms and consequences of
adaptation to symbiotic life among modern Archaea and
Bacteria. As a model system, you will focus on modern
methane-producing and methane-oxidising prokaryotic
consortia, whose convergent evolution from multiple
independent starting points will provide an excellent
opportunity to distinguish general from lineage-specic
features of symbiotic evolution. You will use the com-
parative method to identify the genes and metabolic
pathways that change during transition to a symbiotic
lifestyle, and to develop a general framework for the
evolution of symbiosis between prokaryotes. The pre-
dictions of this framework will then be tested against
genome data from novel consortia sequenced by our
collaborators. The broader aims are not only to under-
stand how modern prokaryotic symbioses evolve and
function, but also to provide new insights into how they
have co-evolved with earth system processes, including
the carbon cycle, through deep evolutionary time. The
project also oers scope for customization based the
successful candidate's research interests \ for example,
investigation of the deeper phylogenetic relationships
among groups of distantly-related symbiotic bacteria
could be an interesting secondary aim.
Requirements: We are looking for a highly motivated
candidate with a passion for elucidating the fundamen-
tal principles of evolutionary biology through compu-
tational analysis. This is primarily a bioinformatics
project, so experience with operating and programming
computers (UNIX, bash, and/or a scripting language
such as Python, Perl or R) is a plus. Both biologists
with an interest in, and aptitude for, computational
analysis, as well as computer scientists or statisticians
with a demonstrated track record in evolutionary biol-
ogy are encouraged to apply. To do so, send a CV and
covering note explaining your interest in the project to
Dr. Tom Williams (tom.a.williams@bristol.ac.uk).
Eligibility, application deadline and start date: The
funding is available to citizens of the UK or any otherEU country. The application deadline is April 29th,
2016. The projected project start date is September
2016, although earlier dates are also possible.

UIceland BrownTrout PopGenomics
The Institute of Life and environmental sciences at the
University of Iceland invites applications for a PhD
studentship.
The project is titled: Population genomics and ecology
of brown trout in Iceland - genetic foot-prints of colo-
nization and ecological diversication in novel habitats.
How exible are the ecologically important traits of colo-
nizing species? What is the role of isolation, adaptation
and gene ow for diversication in novel habitats?
The principal objective of the research is to survey
the phenotypic variation in Icelandic brown trout with
respect to key ecological correlates and to employ popu-
lation genomics to cast light on the processes of diversi-
cation.
The Ph.D. project builds on the fact that in Iceland
brown trout (Salmo trutta) is found in widely varying
habitats and situations; lakes v. streams; cold springs v.
geothermally aected streams; with and without pres-
ence of other salmonids; small v. large populations. The
project is designed to survey the phenotypic variation
emerging from this recent and rapid diversication and
to investigate the genetic foot-prints of these processes.
During the last ice age Iceland was covered with a thick
ice cap that extended far out from the present shore
line. As the ice retreated some 13 - 11.000 years ago
physical conditions for the colonization of terrestrial and
freshwater habitats were created. Three salmonids, Arc-
tic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), brown trout and Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar), are all believed to have colonized
Icelandic freshwaters as the ice retreated. The charr
is the most diverse of these and is found in variable
limnetic and benthic forms that in some cases coexist in
sympatry. Although the brown trout is also known from
a variety of habitats less is known of it's phenotypic
variation.
The Ph.D. project will focus on brown trout popula-
tions in one of the main watersheds in southern Iceland,
including the River Sog and Lake Thingvallavatn, and
streams in the mountainous Hengill geo-thermal area.
The specic aims are to:34 EvolDir April 1, 2016
I) To survey phenotypic variation (e.g. in morphology,
life history characteristics) in populations from a wide
variety habitats and communities II) To employ next
generation sequencing techniques (RAD-seq) to survey
genetic variation within and among populations which
will enable the student to: a) assess the genetic con-
nectedness among populations and probe the history of
colonization b) implicate loci that associate with mor-
phological and ecological characteristics and assess if
and how variation at these loci correlates with ecological
specializations across multiple populations.
We are seeking a student with dedication, drive and good
theoretical background in population genetics and evolu-
tionary biology and an interest in the ecology and genet-
ics of divergence. Good laboratory skills and knowledge
of computer programming, data analysis and statistics
is preferred. The work involves planning and executing
sampling in the eld, acquisition and analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data and numerical analyses.
The position will be at the University of Iceland, within
the Arctic charr and salmonid group. The student would
be a part of this group and receive theoretical and tech-
nical support from its specialists and students that are
conducting comparable work on the Arctic charr in Ice-
land. The project involves collaboration with experts
at the Icelandic freshwater institute, with input from
collaborators at the University of Guelph, Canada, the
University of Aarhus, Denmark, and the H olar Univer-
sity College, Iceland.
The applicant must have completed a M.Sc. degree in
Biology or related elds from a University approved by
the University of Iceland's Graduate School. Those with
an advanced degree including at least a 60 ECTS cred-
its thesis project will be given precedence. Startdate:
summer/fall 2016.
Applications should be sent before the 9th of April
2016, to sigsnor@hi.is, with scanned documentation of
University degrees, a CV and names of 2 references.

ULeeds UK AgeingInBadgers
A funded PhD studentship on \Early-life environment
eects on ageing in European badgers" is available at the
University of Leeds, UK, supervised by Dr Hannah Dug-
dale and co-supervised by Dr Amanda Bretman. The
PhD is in collaboration with Prof David Macdonald and
Dr Chris Newman at the University of Oxford.April 1, 2016 EvolDir 35
This PhD will address why individuals dier in the point
and rate at which they senesce - senescence being the loss
of function with age, from the cellular to the organism
level. Our understanding of the factors that aect senes-
cence is limited: Within a species, are some individuals
better able to buer against senescence due to physiolog-
ical adaptations (such as greater oxidative damage resis-
tance and longer protective chromosome caps - termed
telomeres), environmental eects (e.g. born in years
with high food availability), or social conditions (e.g.
low levels of intra-sexual competition)? This PhD will
investigate these key questions, using data from a natu-
ral population of European badgers subject to variable
environmental and social conditions. This will generate
critical knowledge that will improve our understanding
of how and why some individuals live longer, health-
ier lives than others, improving our understanding of
animal health and informing conservation management
decisions. Further information is available here: https:/-
/hannahdugdale.wordpress.com/opportunities Why you
should apply: The University of Leeds is in the world
top 100 universities, globally recognised for its quality
of teaching and research, and is in the leading group of

PhD. Dr Hannah Dugdale and Dr Amanda Bretman will
provide expertise in evolutionary biology. In particular,
we will provide supervision in the evolution of senes-
cence, social evolution and conservation biology, and we
will encourage you to develop your own research ideas.
You will gain specialist training in molecular ecology
techniques to conduct laboratory work, and you will
have the opportunity to gain eldwork skills - eldwork
takes place in Oxford over two weeks in June, August

AntipredatorBehaviour
Fully-funded PhD studentship: Using virtual reality to
investigate 'protean' anti-predator behaviour
School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, UK
We are seeking to recruit a graduate with an MSc or
a good BSc degree (or equivalent) for a project on the
evolution of 'protean' anti-predator behaviour, starting
in October 2016. This is a fully-funded position covering
fees and stipend for three years, and will be supervised
by an interdisciplinary team with expertise spanning
behavioural ecology and computer science.
Protean anti-predator behaviour is broadly dened as
behaviour that is suciently unpredictable to prevent
a predator anticipating in detail the future position
or actions of its prey, and anecdotal examples (includ-
ing zigzagging, spinning, looping and bouncing) are
extremely common across the animal kingdom. How-
ever, compared to other anti-predator behaviours, pro-
tean movement has received almost no experimental
investigation. The overarching aim of this project is
therefore to elucidate the mechanisms that allow protean
behaviour to be an eective anti-predatory strategy. It
will do this through (a) the three-dimensional tracking
of protean movement in live animals evading simulated
predation events, combined with (b) the use of virtual
reality to allow human 'predators' to attack and chase
virtual prey in three-dimensions. This will enable us to
not only test the ecacy of natural protean behaviours,
but also virtually 'evolve' protean behavioural strategies
in order to explore the specic underlying mechanisms.
There is considerable scope for the student to input
into the direction this project will take, but general
questions that could be investigated include: (1) How
random does protean behaviour need to be in order to
be eective as an anti-predator strategy? (2) How does
predator learning impact on the evolution of protean
escape strategies? (3) And how does prey morphol-
ogy (such as the presence of strongly contrasting body
patterns) interact with protean behaviour? Addressing
these, and related, questions will give the student an
exciting opportunity to work at the interface between
behavioural ecology and computer science, and develop
a highly transferable skillset.
To apply, please send a CV and cover letter to Tom Pike36 EvolDir April 1, 2016
(tpike@lincoln.ac.uk) by 1 April 2016. You may also
contact Tom Pike for informal enquiries. Shortlisted
applicants will be invited for interview.
The University of Lincoln, located in the heart of the city

dle & Pierre L eopold is available at the Institute of
Biology Valrose in Nice (starting data 01/10/2016).
Project summary: Molecular mechanisms that coordi-
nate size relationships among dierent cell types and or-
gans are fundamental for organismal growth and tness,
yet still poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear
how mechanisms governing such allometry evolve within
and between species. This project addresses these ques-
tions using an integrative - molecular and quantitative
genetic - approach and taking take advantage of two
genetic model organisms, the nematode (C. elegans) and
the fruit y (Drosophila melanogaster).
The principal objectives of the project are:
1. Mapping of natural genetic variation in cell/organ
size relationships and their plasticity in C. elegans using
Genome-Wide Association Study, QTL mapping using
F2 RILs and/or experimental evolution/selection lines.
2. Molecular characterization of uncovered candidate
gene variants aecting cell/organ size relationships us-
ing complementation analysis, RNAi, transgenesis and
targeted genome editing.
3. Molecular-developmental analysis of select candidate
genes in Drosophila growth and organ size regulation.

Job/ project description:
The PhD fellow will be appointed on the project enti-
tled \Evolutionary and functional importance of simple
repeats in the genome" funded by the Research council
of Norway through the FRIPRO program and lead by
Professor Kjetill S Jakobsen. The candidate will be
working in an internationally leading research group
recently awarded Frontier Research status.
The project focuses on the functional modulation of
regulatory mechanisms aecting the phenotype by vari-
ations in simple trinucleotide repeats residing inside
(coding) and in the vicinity (or in introns) of genes.April 1, 2016 EvolDir 37
Specically, we would like to test the hypothesis that
hypervariable coding/regulatory repeats are promoting
the ability of a species or population to adapt to a chang-
ing environment. To address this we will use Atlantic
cod and Arabidopsis as model systems. The project
is cross-disciplinary and will utilize genomic, bioinfor-
matics, statistics and experimental approaches and the
appointed PhD candidate will work in a larger team
and in close connection with an additional PhD that
will be hired concurrent with this position.
The PhD candidate will investigate the genomic archi-
tecture of repeats and repeat-length variation in individ-
uals of Atlantic cod and Arabidopsis using PacBio long
read technology. A particular focus will be on simple
repeats within or in the vicinity of genes. Data from
the Aqua Genome Project and the 1001 Arabidopsis
genome project will also be investigated. Further, trans-
generational variation in repeat length will be addressed.
A goal will be to obtain a number of candidate genes
containing repeat length variation as a response to selec-
tional regimes. Another goal will be to build models for
how repeat length variation within the protein aects
structural properties.
The project as a whole consists of three interconnected
work packages. The successful candidate will work on
the work package entitled \Genomic repeat architecture
in Arabidopsis and Atlantic cod and length variation
in simple repeats" led by professor Kjetill S Jakobsen.

UPoitiers Metagenomics
Dear all,
I seek a motivated candidate for a 3-year PhD position
(from October, 2016) on:
*Metagenomics of the association between Wolbachia
and woodlice: evolution and organization of interaction
networks*
Project description: Most of the arthropods are hosting
symbionts which play a major role in the tness of their
hosts. It is well known that the resulting interactions
between hosts and symbionts, ranging from mutualism
to parasitism, are a source of genetic novelty [1]. In
this context, we have to consider the host as a complex
ecosystem including all the symbiotic microbiota [2].
The aim of the PhD project is to analyze the genomic
interactions of the terrestrial isopods microbiota. Ter-
restrial isopods are unconventional models as i) they
constitute the only group of crustaceans that are mainly
adapted to terrestrial environment and ii) they are prone38 EvolDir April 1, 2016
to sex manipulation by the Wolbachia proteobacteria
[3]. In a recent study [4], we determined the bacterial
communities in the pill-bug Armadillidium vulgare. A
high level of bacterial diversity is recorded in all tissues
from the host. A quantitative analysis demonstrated
that the Wolbachia strains that have been identied
in A. vulgare exhibited specic distribution patterns
in tissues [5]. When present, Wolbachia dominate the
microbial community even if other major bacteria are
found. Finally the structure of the bacterial commu-
nities is inuenced by two major triggers: the type of
the Wolbachia strain and the origin of the environmen-
tal bacteria for which the host is highly permissive [6].
Some hypotheses have been proposed on the implica-
tion of these interactions on the functional level. New
high throughput sequencing data recently obtained al-
low us to test these hypotheses. Transcriptomic data
were obtained by whole transcriptome shotgun sequenc-
ing (RNA-seq) on dierent host tissues. Dierentially
expressed genes involved in extended phenotypes (immu-
nity, nutrition, sex determination, symbiotic interactions
or regulation etc) were identied from the comparative
analysis of the resulting transcriptomes. Metagenomics
data (HiSeq Illumina) obtained from A. vulgare conrm
the results on bacterial diversity and also reveal a huge
viral diversity. This approach identies some microbial
eectors.
The rst steps of the project involve bioinformatics toolk-
its in order to construct a de novo metagenomic assembly,
to identify the taxonomic and the functional proles
of the resulting assembly and to analyze their poten-
tial interactions. In a second step, the host-microbiota
interactome will be studied using network analysis of
the metagenomic assembly and the transcriptome of the
host. A particular focus will be put on the impact of
Wolbachia on such an interactome. In vivo (and/or in
vitro) approaches will be developed in order to test the
potential eectors of the interactome.

Position for one PhD student in Ecological Plant Ge-
netics/Genomics in the program of Plant Ecology and
Evolution at Uppsala University, Sweden
Adaptive dierentiation among natural populations is of-
ten attributed to tness trade-os, i.e., that adaptation
to one environment reduces performance in other envi-
ronments. However, the prevalence of tness trade-os,
and the traits and genes underlying tness tradeos are
poorly known. You will work in a project studying the
genetic and ecological mechanisms underlying adaptive
dierentiation among natural populations of the plantApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 39
model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. The goals are (1)
to determine the functional and adaptive signicance of
dierences in plant phenology (timing of germination,
and owering time) between populations close to the
northern and southern margins of the native range, (2)
to explore the molecular basis and geographic distribu-
tion of QTL (quantitative trait loci) for seed dormancy
and owering time identied in previous experiments, (3)
to quantify the individual and combined eects of these
QTL on tness, and (4) to determine their contribution
to tness trade-os across environments. The project
is conducted within the framework of an international
research collaboration. The successful candidate will
settle the exact prole of her/his PhD project together
with the supervisor Jon ~Agren.
The position requires a MSc degree (or equivalent) in
evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics or a related eld.
Prociency in English is a requirement. Strong motiva-
tion, and ability to work independently and as part of a
team are important qualities. The successful candidate
should have a keen interest in population biology, and
ideally experience from previous work in evolutionary
biology, ecology or genetics.
The postgraduate training comprises four years of full
time studies within the postgraduate school at the De-
partment of Ecology and Genetics, at the Evolutionary
Biology Centre (http://www.ieg.uu.se/). The position
can be combined with up to 20 % of teaching assis-
tantship, which will then prolong the position accord-

WageningenU AnimalGenomics
We are looking for talented and enthusiastic PhD candi-
dates to join a multi-disciplinary team at the interface
of molecular and quantitative genetics, at the Animal
Breeding and Genomics Centre (ABGC) and the Cen-
tre for Genetic Resources, the Netherlands (CGN) of
Wageningen University and Research Centre.
Project: Using Whole Genome Sequence information
for demographic and functional evaluation of managed
populations.
Summary of research objectives: As sequencing entire
genomes is becoming a standard practice in population
studies, a wealth of information on variation in species is
becoming available that can ignite novel applications for
population management. The overall aim of the project
is to use entire genome data of managed populations
(in situ and ex situ) and evaluate how best to use that
data to reduce inbreeding risk and loss of diversity in
the species.
The main objectives of the project are: a. To iden-
tify extent and nature of key demographic events in
managed populations, such as inbreeding, hybridiza-
tion, or changes in selection, based on genomic data.
b. To use in-silico predictions of the function of ge-
nomic variation that may underlie unique phenotypes
or inbreeding risk. c. To quantify demographic disconti-
nuities and functional variation in relation to variation
in the entire species, with the aim to develop a rational,
genomics-based, appraisal of managed genetic resources
as reservoirs of variation. d. To apply methods at the
interface of population genetics and machine learning to
develop classiers that can be used for automated evalu-
ation of key population processes, including inbreeding
risk.
Case studies will be used to advance the concepts central
to the project. By analysing whole genome data of thou-
sands of individuals, demographic discontinuities and
inbreeding risk can be quantied. This is vitally impor-
tant for sustainable population management, especially
in relation to the value of recognized in situ (live popula-
tions) or ex situ (genebank) resources. While the project
focuses on domesticated populations, the concepts are
universally applicable to any managed species since pre-
dictors and classiers will be derived from generic whole
genome data sources.Prole of candidate: Enthusiastic PhD candidate, either
biologist (or related eld) with a background in popula-
tion/conservation genetics and/or functional genomics,
with anity for bioinformatics, or bioinformatician or
computational biologist with anity for biodiversity
and population genetics.
We oer a challenging position in an inspiring multidis-
ciplinary and international environment, in one of the
leading groups on animal breeding and genomics in the
world. You will be part of a research team involving
multiple partner organisations. The proposed start is
June 2016.
A fulltime position as a PhD candidate for 4 years, after
after which you should have completed your PhD thesis
and individual training plan. The salary for a PhD can-
didate starts at euro 2.147,- gross per month in the rst
year and extends to a maximum of euro 2.745,- gross
per month in the fourth year (in accordance with the
Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).

ZFMK Bonn Barcoding
The Center for Molecular Biodiversity Research at the
Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig in Bonn
(ZFMK, Germany) invites applications for a PhD stu-
dentship. The studentship will be part of a project
within the German Barcode of Life (GBOL). Starting
date: not later than 1st May 2016, preferentially earlier.
Duration: until 31st December 2018 Salary: German
salary scale (TV-L E13, 55 %).
We seek an enthusiastic and highly motivated candidate
to work on a project on metabarcoding and biodiversity
at ZFMK in Bonn. The main objective of the stu-
dentship is to create a biodiversity map of invertebrate
communities using environmental DNA samples derived
from the Eifel National Park and to monitor species/
ecosystems over time. This will be a timely project since
there is no comprehensive biodiversity study German
National Parks, such as the Eifel NP, using HTP (high-
throughput) sequencing approaches. This will move
towards establishing an ecient biodiversity-monitoring
approach providing critical insights into biodiversity as-
sessment on a temporal scale. The project will involve
handling environmental samples (Malaise insect traps
and soil samples) in the lab and in the eld, as well
as using next generation 'metagenetics/ metabarcoding'
approaches to tracking mainly meio- and macrofauna
communities. There will be opportunity to develop a
preliminary pipeline as a tool for biomonitoring and
best-practice guidelines for environmental barcoding
(sampling protocols, preservation and downstream data
analysis). The student will join a multi-disciplinary su-
pervisory team led by Dr Vera Fonseca (biodiversity and
metabarcoding) and Dr Jonas Astrin (Biobank and DNA
barcoding), together with an external collaborator, Dr
Christopher Quince from Warwick University (food web,
meta-analysis), oering the student to gain knowledge
and training in Bioinformatics, Ecology, Genomics, Con-
servation and Biodiversity. The PhD candidate should
be highly motivated, with good computer command
line skills and with a strong enthusiasm for environ-
mental molecular biodiversity. The candidate will haveto spend some time in the Eifel NP (driving license
not necessary, but helpful). Desirable skills are molec-
ular biology (e.g., DNA/RNA extraction, PCR) and
bioinformatic environmental meta-analyses experience
(HTP). Students are expected to acquire and develop
new skills but candidates with prior expertise in HTP
meta-analysis will be given preference. The candidate
should have a Master's degree, or be close to completing
a Master's degree in Biology or related discipline. Fluent
spoken and written English is essential. The Center for
Molecular Biodiversity Research at the Zoological Re-
search Museum Alexander Koenig oers a pleasant and
stimulating research environment with a modern molec-
ular laboratory and a state-of-the-art high-performance
computing cluster. Current research projects in the de-
partment deal with DNA barcoding and metabarcoding
terrestrial biodiversity (German Barcode of Life, GBOL)
and Environmental barcoding of aquatic invertebrates
(EBAI, Norway University Museum), as well as other
exciting research lines such as the phylogeny of insects
(e.g., www.1kite.org) and other groups of organisms and
the organization and evolution of insect genomes (e.g.,
i5K).
Applications should include: (1) Letter of motivation
(relevant skills, experience and research interests) (2)
Curriculum vitae (3) Ocial BSc and/ or MSc certi-
cates (4) Contact details of two (ideally academic) refer-
ences Closing date for Applications: 1st April 2016. Ap-
plications should be submitted in English and electroni-

ERC-LINKED POSITIONS NORD UNIVERSITY NORWAY
A ve-year researcher position (ref. 30065360), a three-
year postdoctoral position (ref. 30065361) and a three-
year PhD fellowship (ref. 30065360) in epigenetics of sh
domestication are available at the Faculty of Biosciences
and Aquaculture (FBA), Nord University (Bod, Nor-
way).
FBA invites applications from outstanding candidates
for the above positions within the project Innovative
Epigenetic Markers for Fish Domestication (EPIFISH),
which has been recently funded by the EU H2020 excel-
lence programme ERC consolidator grant. The project
leader, Professor Jorge Fernandes is aliated with the
Strategic research group marine genomics.
About EPIFISH Domestication is a fascinating and very
complex example of evolution in action, involving a com-
bination of random genetic drift, articial selection for
desirable traits and adaptive selection to new environ-
mental conditions. EPIFISH is a timely project that will
address sh domestication at its research frontier using
a multidisciplinary approach combining evolutionary bi-
ology, functional genomics, epigenetics and aquaculture.
The rapid pace of substantial phenotypic changes dur-
ing adaptation to new environmental conditions in sh
undergoing domestication raises the hypothesis that epi-
genetic mechanisms are involved in this process. Thus,
the overarching aim of EPIFISH is to ascertain the role
of epigenetics in sh domestication using the Nile tilapia(Oreochromis niloticus) as a commercially important
model species.

qualications, requirements, salary and how to apply

UOslo 3yr EvolutionDefenceSystems
Researcher in aquatic evolutionary ecology
A researcher position is available at the Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Synthesis, (CEES), Depart-
ment of Biosciences.
The position is for 38 months, and with start date as
soon as possible after June 1st 2016. The successful
candidate will work on the project \The evolution of
defence systems: theory and experiment" (EVODEF)
funded by the Research Council of Norway.
Project description
The EVODEF project focuses on the evolutionary ecol-
ogy of organismal defence traits. Organisms may use
an impressive diversity of defences against their natural
enemies. Evidence from a range of animal and plant sys-
tems suggests that the dierent defence traits expressed
by an organism cannot be understood in isolation from
each other, but must be studied as parts of complex
suites of traits. The project combines theoretical models
(mainly developed by the PI) with empirical experiments
(conducted by the candidate) to understand the proper-
ties of such defensive systems and how they evolve under
dierent selective conditions. Topics of interest include
how defence lines are phenotypically co-expressed and
coevolve, how defences against dierent enemies (e.g.
predators or parasites) aect each other, and the role of
non-genetic inheritance (e.g. maternal and epigenetic
eects) in defence expression. In the theoretical part
of the project we will develop mathematical models of
organismal defence relevant to several empirical systems.
In the experimental part of the project, we will use the
inducible defences of Daphnia to test novel predictions
from theory; the results will in turn stimulate further
theory development.
The successful candidate will join our team and study
the defence traits of Daphnia in the lab. The project
provides a unique opportunity to design and run ex-
periments that test novel theoretical ideas and inform
ongoing theoretical work. The ideal candidate will make
a major contribution to the planned research, but will
also develop his/her own complementary lines of re-April 1, 2016 EvolDir 63
search that reect the candidate's own expertise and
interests and that broadly t within the project's main
goals. There is growing interest in developing a research
environment for Daphnia at the department and it is
highly desirable that the candidate will take an active
part in this, as well as contribute to developing future
collaborative projects that build upon achieved results.
Requirements
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has
a strategic ambition of being a leading research faculty.
Candidates for these fellowships will be selected in accor-
dance with this, and expected to be in the upper segment
of their class with respect to academic credentials.
Applicants must hold a PhD-degree or other correspond-
ing education equivalent to a Norwegian doctoral degree
in biology or a related eld. The successful candidate
will be responsible for the establishment and mainte-
nance of Daphnia cultures, the daily running of experi-
ments, imaging, morphometrics, and data analysis. A
proven, solid record of running lab experiments with
small aquatic organisms (preferably Daphnia) and main-
taining them in culture is required.
The ideal candidate has extensive lab experience with
Daphnia, strong statistical and writing skills, pays care-
ful attention to detail and theoretical context when
designing experiments, and has some experience with
eld sampling. A background from evolutionary ecol-
ogy or evolutionary biology is considered an advantage.
Field sampling is planned for the summer 2016, and
it is desirable that applicants are available to start by
this time. A research stay abroad is planned during one
section of the project.
The successful candidate will work in close collaboration
with the project PI and other members of the team. We
seek a highly motivated, enthusiastic person with the
ability to think creatively and critically, and with the
ambition to gain new insights and publish papers in
leading, international journals. Applicants must show
good interpersonal skills and be willing to work in close
collaboration with others, as well as have the ability
to work independently. Applicants should have a good
publication record for the career stage.
A good command of English is required.

African Arabidopsis samples
Other: Arabidopsis thaliana collection from African sky
islands
We are seeking collaborators to help collecting Arabidop-
sis thaliana seeds from east Africa. Preliminary studies(part of the Arabidopsis thaliana 1001 Genomes project)
have shown that lines from east-African \mountain is-
lands" are very distinct from all others worldwide, pre-
senting interesting opportunities for population genetics
and biogeography studies. The lines were collected near
\Ketumbeine Forest Reserve" (2.8738 S, 36.2 E), eleva-
tion at around 2700 m. We are seeking collaborators
who are familiar with these habitats to help collecting
more seeds from east Africa.

to be held at Pontio Arts and Innovation Centre,
Bangor, UK is now welcoming registrations (http:/-
/www.fsbi.org.uk/conference-2016/registration-2/) and,
very importantly, EARLY-BIRD registration ( ^A$190
GBP vs. full rate of ^A$220) and student registration
(^A$110 GBP) will remain open until 29th of April, 17:00
UK time.
We therefore suggest that you visit the link and register
as soon as possible.

Budget Cryobox Organization
Hi all!
I'm hoping some of you may be able to suggest a route to
take with the organization of ~800 cryoboxes. Currently,
these boxes are being stored across the lab that I am a
part of: in cold rooms, in fridges, and in freezers. They
are stacked without much order, so that when a box
is removed it is put back without thought to location.
This has caused issues with accounting for samples in
a database. Boxes get misplaced... and end up being
\lost" for several weeks before they \show up" again.
Ideally, we would like to purchase metal freezer racks
to better inuence how/where boxes are stacked and
stored. However, this can be costly for the quantity
we require. Does anyone know of a vendor that sells
metal freezer racks at a reduced cost? Does any lab have
unneeded racks that we could acquire? OR, can anyone
think of a cheaper alternative to the metal racks? We've
tried plastic bins, but have been unable to nd anything
with dimensions that maximize cryobox storage.
Any insight will be greatly appreciated!

DominicanRepublic VolFieldAssist
Woodpeckers
TWO eld assistants needed for a study of ecology of
colonial, cooperative breeding and foraging behavior in
the Hispaniolan Woodpecker in the Dominican Repub-
lic. Field research assistants will participate in data
collection during an intensive ~3.5-month eld season.
Assistant duties will include (but are not limited to)
nest monitoring, focal behavioral observations (includ-
ing nest watches and foraging records), assisting with
tree-climbing, color-band reading, nest-searching, assist-
ing with bird capture and processing, and data entry. I
am currently looking for:
TWO (2nd term) half-term assistants are needed to ar-
rive between 15 and 30 April (exible) and remain until
30 July. Applications will be accepted until positions are
lled, but preference will be given to those submitted
by 26 March.
Location: Piedra Blanca (near Jarabacoa and close to
Salto Jimenoa I), La Vega province, Dominican Republic
Job description: The Hispaniolan Woodpecker (Melan-
erpes striatus) nests colonially, ranging from 2 to as
many as 20+ simultaneously active nests in the same
tree, making it very unique among woodpeckers (only
one other picid species of the more than 200 is known to
nest in colonies). Additionally, the Hispaniolan Wood-
pecker is the most sexually size dimorphic of Melanerpeswoodpeckers. Since 2012, I have been color-banding and
observing these woodpeckers to better understand the
social organization of colonies. Fieldwork in the 2016
eld season will focus on further studying social organi-
zation of colonies, attempting to answer such questions
as:
1) How do nesting substrate (live vs. dead trees) and
its availability inuence colony size and structure?
2) What information do prospecting birds utilize to \de-
cide" where to nest, and how does this information use
inuence variation in colony size?
More generally, we will collect data to help test hypothe-
ses regarding the costs, benets, and consequences of
group living, the operation of sexual selection in cooper-
ative societies, and the evolutionary factors driving the
woodpecker's exceptional size dimorphism. An impor-
tant secondary objective of our work will be studying
how parasitic y larvae in the genus Philornis impact
nesting success.
Field research assistants will participate in data collec-
tion during an intensive 3.5-month eld season. Assis-
tant duties will include (but are not limited to) nest
monitoring, focal behavioral observations (including
nest watches, dominance watches, and foraging records),
assisting with tree-climbing, color-band reading, nest-
searching, assisting with bird capture and processing
(including metal- and color-banding), and data manage-
ment and entry. All volunteers will have the opportunity
to learn various tree-climbing techniques. Assistants will
be trained to set up, operate, and take down a unique
elevated mist-net system developed specically for this
project but with applications to other ornithological
studies.
Days will be long and the work will be physically and
mentally demanding, but for those seeking to gain ex-
perience in eld research, you wont be disappointed.
The workweek will typically be 6 days long in humid,
mosquito-lled elds and forests, involving hiking some-
times muddy, steep hills, climbing barbed-wire fences,
and avoiding bulls; this work will leave you exhausted
at the end of the day! Assistants will be involved in
all aspects of the project, including discussions of the
conceptual framework of the project.
Neotropical bird species are generally poorly known
with many aspects of their natural history incomplete
or wholly unknown. Hispaniola is an island with many
poorly known native or endemic species that will reveal
their intriguing secrets to those motivated and patient
enough to look. While our work will focus primarily
on Hispaniolan Woodpecker, opportunities to collect
data on the islands other avian denizens may arise, andApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 73
we will exploit these opportunities when possible. Any
such observations of other bird species made by eld
assistants may result in publications (so an added bonus
of this eldwork is the possibility of not only adding a
publication to your CV but making a real contribution
to our knowledge of Hispaniolan birds and Neotropical
ornithology). That having been said, the woodpecker
research takes priority.
Dates:
Spring/summer assistants- Start: ~15 April, End: ~30
July 2016. ( ~3 months)
College graduates and undergraduates are encouraged
to apply. Current college students are encouraged to
apply for academic credit for their work at their home
institution.
Salary: Housing, drinking water, and research-related
travel within the Dominican Republic will be covered.
Additionally, some funding is available to partly or fully
cover airfare to/from the Dominican Republic. Assis-
tants will have to cover their food expenses ( ~$30 USD
per week).
Deadline: Until positions are lled. Preference will be
given to those

Draba verna samples
We are starting a research project on the ploidy and
ecological characteristics of this small spring (or win-
ter) annual, known as 'whitlow grass', Draba verna, or
Erophila verna and hoping to get seed from as many sites
globally as possible. If you are able to nd plants and
can send samples, here are some guidelines as to what
we are looking for, below. PLEASE FORWARD this
request to botanists and naturalists in other places, in-
cluding outside of the U.S. (so instructions are included
for collections made outside of the U.S.).
Please wait until the plant is nished owering and seeds
are ripe (but before dispersal, of course). Please note the
exact latitude, longitude and if possible elevation of the
site, with photos of the plants and location if possible.Please include your own name, email or other contact
information, and institution or address. FROM THE
U.S.: If you can send whole, pressed, air dried plants,
please send 12-15 whole pressed plants with seeds, or,
save seeds only from the plants and send dried seeds
packaged separately from each plant. FROM OUTSIDE
OF THE U.S.: The USDA does not allow whole plants,
so please send seeds only. Their requirements are at the
bottom of this note.
If you have seeds from fewer plants, that is also useful,
please send what you can collect. If you have seeds from
other species of Draba or Erophila, please identify the
species and send those, they may also be useful for our
research project. Our contact information is: Jessica

Inquiry Book UnknownSpecies
German press inquiry - book \50 unknown species"
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a freelancing German science writer and biologist
by profession.
At present I am working on a book that is intended to
tell 50 portraits of hardly known species (animals).
The intention is to tell the reader there is much more in
the world than main predators, elephants, rhinos and
dolphins. More than killing, mating and foraging.
Moreover I intend to tell the reader there is a fascinating
world outside that is worth being protected.
My question is if there is anyone out there who knows
species that are unique, pretty unknown and somehow
fascinating to the general audience.
Besides I would like tell some anecdotes from the eld-
work that are linked to a certain species - being lost
in the desert while doing a survey or being stuck in
the mood while chasing an insect or whatsoever. A
fascinating blend of eldwork and diversity.
My rst ideas are the stinking ant (Paltothyreus tarsa-
tus) and the Demodex family that is closely linked to
man and still hardly known.
I would be happy if you could send me one or two ideas.
Looking forward to hearing from you, best Tim

Joshua Tree Genome Project
Dear Evoldir members,
I am writing to share the exciting news about an initia-
tive to sequence the genome of the Joshua Tree (Yucca
brevifolia sensu lato). Todd Esque (USGS), Leslie De-
Falco (USGS), Jim Leebens-Mack (University of Geor-
gia), Mike McKain (Danforth Plant Sciences Center),
Jeremy Yoder (University of British Columbia) and IApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 75
are collaborating on a project that we hope will allow
us to identify genes involved in climate adaptation and
coevolution with yucca moths.
As part of the project were starting a social me-
dia campaign to generate public engagement, and
promote public understanding of conservation ge-
nomics. You can check out our project page here:
http://joshuatreegenome.org/ , follow us on twitter:
@JTGenome, and join our Facebook group here: https:/-
/www.facebook.com/jtgenome/ .
We've also launched a crowd-funding project raise money
to pay for pilot sequencing. You can donate to our
crowdfunding campaign here: https://experiment.com/-
joshuatree This project is part of Experiment.com's
liberal arts college competition; the project with the
most donors on March 16th will get an additional $2000
from Experiment. Please help us to spread the word!
Why Sequence The Joshua Tree Genome?
A Joshua tree reference genome would open the doors
to answering many questions, of both scientic and
conservation importance.
Understanding the genetics of coevolution. Like all yuc-
cas, Joshua trees rely on a specialized group of moths to
move their pollen from plant to plant. Amazingly, female
moths actively collect and distribute yucca pollen after
laying their eggs in the owers they pollinate. Yucca
moths eectively farm yucca seeds as nutrition for their
ospring. In exchange for reliable pollination, yuccas
sacrice some of their seeds to the moths larvae. Joshua
tree owers exhibit a suit of adaptations that promote
active moth pollination while deterring larval consump-
tion of all their developing seeds. The genetic bases
of these adaptations, however, are currently unknown.
Sequencing of a reference Joshua tree genome would
pave the way for association mapping to identify genes
contributing to co-evolved adaptations to yucca moth
pollination and larval seed predation.
Discovering genes that allow adaptation to desert en-
vironments.The Mojave Desert contains some of the
hottest and most arid regions of North America. To
survive in these inhospitable environments, Joshua trees
have developed an array of physiological and morpho-
logical adaptations, from thickening of the waxy cuticle
on the outside the leaves, to reduced stomatal pore size,
and the presence of water storage cells. Sequencing the
Joshua tree genome will help to identify the genetic
basis of these adaptations, and will identify existing
genetic variation in Joshua trees that may allow some
individuals to survive and adapt to warmer tempera-
tures. We will combine genome-wide-association studies
with gene expression assays in common gardens to deter-mine which genes have enabled Joshua trees to survive
in the Mojave.
A genomic approach to conservation. Ensuring that
Joshua trees will persist into the future means preserv-
ing not only the plants themselves, but also the genetic
variation that will allow them to adapt to changing
climates and environments. We will use a landscape ge-
nomics approach to measure the total amount of genetic
variation in dierent populations, and estimate genetic
dierentiation between populations. This information
will allow us to identify which populations of Joshua
tree have the greatest potential to adapt to future en-
vironmental changes, and give these areas the highest
priority for conservation.
Genome archeology. Like the vast majority of species
within the Agavoideae, Joshua trees have ve large
chromosomes and twenty-ve small chromosomes. The
bimodal karyotype is hypothesized to have originated
with an ancient allopolyploidy event. Sequencing the
Joshua tree genome will allow us to test this hypothesis
by comparing gene content and organization between the
large and small chromosome sets. Further, comparisons
with related genomes just outside of the Agavoideae will
reveal how the putative subgenomes have changes since
polyploidization.

Laboratory Fees
Apologies for any cross-postings of this message.76 EvolDir April 1, 2016
Please send all replies to brent.p.thoma@jsums.edu
I am sure most of you can commiserate with university
systems continually facing budget cuts in recent years.
At our university, this has resulted in little to no money
available to purchase basic supplies and equipment for
undergraduate teaching labs. There are a number of
funding opportunities to update or advance undergrad
laboratory equipment and activities but few, if any,
provide funds for long-term support and maintenance.
I am aware that many departments with lab courses
have created 'lab fees' to help ameliorate the funding
of innovative and informative lab activities; however,
I have found little written text containing such infor-
mation. Thus, I am writing in hopes that you would
provide me with any information on the implementation
of 'lab fees' at your respective institutions.
This information will be compiled and presented to
our university in hopes to implement our own lab fees
to supply our students with a more robust curriculum
including both eld and laboratory exercises.
I appreciate your consideration and time in this en-
deavor. I will post the results of this inquiry for those
of you who are interested.
Cheers, Brent

Liverpool Proteomics BSPRLecture
'What has proteomics ever done for us?' Professor
Rob Beynon (http://www.liverpool.ac.uk/cpr), a bio-
chemist who works in close collaboration with the
Mammalian Behaviour and Evolution Group (http:/-
/www.liverpool.ac.uk/mbe ) in Liverpool UK, is the
BSPR Lecturer this year (http://www.bspr.org/news/-
bspr-lecturer). He has been asked to deliver two types
of talk, one of which promotes the application of pro-
teomics to new areas of science. To this end, and with
a little trepidation, he is oering to deliver one of his
lectures to Departments with a strong interest in Evo-
lutionary Biology and Animal Behaviour. He promises
the keep the nerdy jargon down to a minimum! This isthe abstract for this talk:
The proteomics of sex
Robert J Beynon, Centre for Proteome Research, Insti-
tute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool
Most of evolutionary biology and animal behaviour is
about sex! Sex is, in part, mediated through proteins
and their interactions with other proteins. Thus, the
study of proteins involved in topics such as sexual re-
production, sperm competition, mate selection and in-
breeding avoidance could provide valuable new insights
into the drivers of speciation and evolution. In my talk
I will explore how successful collaborations between pro-
tein chemists and evolutionary biologists can yield new
insights in this area. The biologists bring the big ideas,
while the protein chemists nd sneaky and novel ways
to test their hypotheses, developing a truly interdisci-
plinary team approach - a model of modern biological
research. I will target my talk towards the biologist,
make few assumptions about the technical level of un-
derstanding of protein chemistry or mass spectrometry,
and illustrate throughout with some fascinating studies
we have conducted with the Mammalian Behaviour and
Evolution Group here in Liverpool. If there is time I'll
discuss the recipe for a productive collaboration across
these two disciplines.
If you would like Rob to deliver a talk, please make

MolecularEcol Prize Nominations
I am soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular
Ecology Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is a young and inherently
interdisciplinary research area. As a consequence, re-
search in molecular ecology is not currently represented
by a single scientic society. Likewise, there is no body
that actively promotes the discipline or recognizes its
pioneers. To help ll this void, the editorial board of
the journal *Molecular Ecology* created the Molecular
Ecology Prize to recognize signicant contributions to
this area of research.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to Molecular Ecology.
Presumably these contributions would mostly be scien-
tic, but the door is open for other kinds of contributions
that were crucial to the development of the eld. Pre-
vious winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre
Taberlet, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pem-
berton, Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent
Excoer, Johanna Schmitt, and Fred Allendorf.
Please send your nominations with a short supporting
statement (no more than 150 words) by 15 May 2016
directly to me (fred.allendorf@gmail.com).
Thanks on behalf of the Molecular Ecology Prize Se-
lection Committee. We look forward to hearing from

Structural and functional constraints on protein evolu-
tion
Proteins are under selective constraints to fold stably
into their native conformation and to carry out their
biological function. These selective constraints shape
how proteins evolve, and they cause variation in sub-
stitution rates among the sites within a given protein.
In particular, sites in the core of a protein, with many
residue-residue contacts, tend to be more conserved than
sites on the protein surface. Further, catalytic residues
in enzymes are highly conserved, and they impart a mea-
surable increase in conservation to much of the enzyme
structure, in a distance-dependent manner. (The further
a site is from a catalytic residue, the less extra conserva-
tion it experiences.) Finally, protein-protein interfaces
show a surprising ability for evolutionary divergence,
even if they are strongly selected for function.

Pyrenees VolFieldTech
PlantSpeciation DeadlineExt
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and Tech-
nology (IST) Austria requires volunteers to assist with
eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees (Spain)
this coming summer (late May - early August).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary dynam-
ics underlying species diversication in the genus Antir-
rhinum (snapdragons). A major focus of this research
involves eld work on natural hybrid zones between two
subspecies with dierent ower colours. Most of the
eld work is contributing to a long-term pedigree project
aimed at establishing a direct link from genotype to phe-
notype to tness. With 20,000 samples collected over six
generations (so far), this provides an exciting and pow-
erful system to examine many outstanding questions in
speciation and quantitative genetics in wild populations.
We are seeking volunteers to assist with the eld work,
which involves working in teams mapping the location of80 EvolDir April 1, 2016
individual plants (GPS), tagging and sampling them for
leaves and owers, measuring quantitative traits, phe-
notyping them for ower pigmentation and processing
material for later DNA extraction. There may also be
opportunities to be involved in other projects we are
doing on plant-pollinator interactions, pollen fertility
and community ecology surveys. Most of the work is
outdoors, however we do spend some time indoors pro-
cessing samples. The work is highly team orientated,
typically in groups of 2-3 in the eld and larger groups
processing samples back at the research station. This
is a great opportunity for anybody looking to obtain
experience in eld work relating to evolutionary biology,
plant ecology and plant-animal interactions. You will
also be part of a large multidisciplinary team includ-
ing researchers from IST Austria (Vienna), John Innes
Centre (Norwich, UK) and the University of Toulouse.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia).
We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a pic-
turesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(within Europe) are covered. However, we cannot oer
any further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students with a strong interest in
working outdoors with plants. You must be meticulous
with recording data and also be comfortable working
as part of a team. Experience with eld-based projects
and plants is preferred but not essential.
We require assistance between late May and late July.
Depending on the year and the plants, we may extend
our time into August. Length of stay is exible but a
minimum stay of 3 weeks is required.
Please send any questions to the email address below.

Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis).
Voluntary research assistant: Starting in May 2016 for
6 months
We are looking for one voluntary research assistant to
help with our research on the completely subterranean,
highly social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damaren-
sis).
This position entails assisting in several studies on hor-
monal eects on social behaviour of mole-rats. We are
interested in the eects of prolactin and testosterone on
allo-parental care in non-reproducing mole-rats. The
research assistant will be involved in all steps of the ex-
periments and will mainly work in the laboratory with
our captive mole-rats which are housed in large semi-
natural tunnel systems. The responsibilities include
behavioural observations, hormonal measures (blood
sampling, urine sampling) and hormonal manipulations.
The laboratory is situated in the Kuruman River Re-
serve in the southern Kalahari, Northern Cape province
of South Africa.
Additionally, we are conducting a capture-mark and re-
capture study in which the voluntary research assistant
can get involved in. Entire groups of mole-rats will be
captured and individually marked. Morphological mea-
surements and tissue samples will be obtained before
the release of the animals. The eld work is physically
demanding (long hours, heavy digging to capture mole-
rats) and weather conditions are very challenging (heat
during the day, very cold during the night). Field work
will make trapping during the night necessary. The
assistant will mostly be working along one more experi-
enced scientist but will need to work independently at
times.
The successful applicant will work in a team of 5-10
persons. The research station is also the home of sev-
eral other projects studying meerkats (www.kalahari-
meerkats.com), pied babblers, forktailed drongos, bat-
eared foxes and hornbills resulting in a stimulating sci-
entic environment. Around 20-30 research assistants
are based at the station year round. Research assis-
tants will learn a range of skills such as remote sensingApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 81
of behaviour, endocrine sampling techniques, capture-
mark-recapture techniques, behavioural observations,
data handling and management.
Applicants should be enthusiastic, willing to work hard
and keen to get involved in an ecological research project
in the African bush. The research assistants are ex-
pected to work at night when trapping schedules require
it and need to be t as capturing mole-rats requires the
capacity to do hard physical work (digging) in a chal-
lenging environment. A zoology related degree and/or
previous eld experience will be considered an asset.
The successful applicant needs to be a team player and
generally a person that enjoys collaboration and team
work.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants
are paid a monthly allowance to cover their personal
costs and food. The bus fare from Johannesburg to
the eld site can be covered but we do not provide an
international airfare, travel insurance, or visa fees for
applicants from overseas.
Applications received until the 25th of March 2016 are
ensured full consideration. Later applications can be
considered if the position has not been lled.

Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night in
winter, sometimes over 40 ^AC during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of a
small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance of
the research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1450 (around 175 US$, 100 Euro) must be paid for ac-82 EvolDir April 1, 2016
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 350 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$ / 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
two volunteers starting in April 2016 and two volunteers
to start in June / July 2016. Volunteers are expected to
stay for 2-3 months. We are also looking for volunteers
for later in 2016.

outstanding student talk in the eld of systematics at
the annual meetings of the Society of Systematic Biolo-
gists (SSB). This is SSB's premier award, and is judged
by the quality and creativity of the research completed
over the course of the student's Ph.D. program. The
award consists of $1000, a certicate of distinction, and a
two-year subscription to the journal Systematic Biology.
Members of the Society who are students or have com-
pleted their Ph.D. within the last 15 months are eligible.Applicants may be from any country, but MUST be
members of SSB, and are advised to join the Society
as soon as possible to be considered. Previous Mayr
Award winners are not eligible.
*IMPORTANT: Submit your abstract early to be sure
you will be considered for the award*
How to become eligible for the Ernst Mayr Award
+ To be considered for this award, you MUST submit an
abstract of your talk to the Evolution meeting website
(http://evolutionmeetings.org/) at the time of registra-
tion. Instructions for registering as a potential Mayr
award contender will be given on the meeting website. +
Abstracts should clearly indicate methods used, conclu-
sions, and the relevance to systematics. Presentations
focusing on other areas of biology (ecology, behavior, ge-
netics, populations or molecular biology, etc.) that lack
a strong systematics emphasis are not eligible. + Ap-
plications for this award will be accepted only until the
end of early registration (April 30, 2016) or EARLIER
if all of the meeting talk slots ll. So APPLY EARLY
to ensure that you are considered for the award and are
able to present at the meeting. + At the closing of early
registration, a subset of applicants will be selected by
the SSB Awards Committee to present their talks in the
Mayr symposium during the meeting. All applicants
will be notied about selection decisions approximately
May 15. Applicants not selected for an award will be
given a regular concurrent talk in another session at the
meeting.
Judging: Based on the submitted abstracts, the Mayr
Awards Committee (appointed by the Awards Chair)
will select a maximum of 16 applicants for inclusion in
the Mayr Award symposium. The Mayr symposium
will be held at a single venue as a continuous session.
Talks will be judged on creativity, depth and excellence
of research, and on quality of presentation. Competitive
students are expected to be in the nal stages of their
doctoral program, presenting results of a major body of
work.
Co-Authors: The talk may be co-authored. It is under-
stood that the ideas, data and conclusions presented
are primarily and substantially the work of the student
presenter, and the intention is that the student presen-

SSB Mini-ARTS Grant
The Society of Systematic Biologists is pleased to of-
fer Mini-ARTS awards to enhance taxonomic knowl-
edge (http://www.systbio.org/mini-arts-awards.html).
These awards are for revisionary taxonomy and sys-
tematics, modeled after the NSF Dear Colleague Let-
ter: Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy and Systemat-
ics (ARTS) recently developed within the Systematics
and Biodiversity Science Cluster (http://www.nsf.gov/-
pubs/2011/nsf11037/nsf11037.jsp). We are calling these
'Mini-ARTS' grants. These awards are designed to al-
low SSB members (students, post-docs, and faculty) to
spend a summer or semester apprenticed to an expert
in a particular taxonomic group or to enhance revision-
ary taxonomic and systematics research in novel ways.
Goals of this award program are to address constraints
on our knowledge of undescribed biodiversity, assist in
passing on taxonomic expertise before it is lost, increase
the number of students with broad training in organ-
ismal biology and systematics, and support projects
in biodiversity and taxonomy informatics as well as
monographic and revisionary taxonomy. Activities can
include a trip to the taxonomist's laboratory, pay for
the taxonomist to visit the applicant's laboratory for
a period of time, or pay for costs of computer time or
development of interactive keys for electronic dissemina-
tion of systematics results. Requests for support may be
in any amount up to $3,000. We expect to fund between
1-3 of these awards this year.

UGeorgia REU
EvolutionAndClimateChange
subject: NSF REU position with Anderson lab (UGA)
in the ecological and evolutionary consequences of cli-
mate change on natural plant populations
body: Jill Anderson and Susana Wadgymar at the Uni-
versity of Georgia are searching for an enthusiastic under-
graduate with a strong interest in evolutionary ecology
for eld research in an NSF REU position (National
Science Foundation, Research Experience for Undergrad-
uates) from June-August 2016.
We study the ecological and evolutionary consequences
of climate change for natural plant populations. We
focus on research on Drummond's rockcress (Boechera
stricta in the plant family Brassicaceae), a mustard plant
native to the Rocky Mountains. Our studies take place
around the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (http://-
www.rmbl.org/), which is located in Gothic, Colorado
near the wildower capital of Colorado (Crested Butte).
We quantify plant tness and traits to ask whether cli-
mate change could disrupt long-standing patterns of lo-
cal adaptation, and to test whether phenotypic plasticity
will enable populations to persist in the short-term. We
perform large-scale reciprocal transplant experiments
to examine patterns of adaptive evolution and natural
selection in contemporary landscapes. Since fall 2013,
we have planted ~60,000 seeds and seedlings into ve
experimental gardens ranging in elevation from 2500
m to 3340 m (8202 feet to 11000 feet). Our summer
research involves intensive monitoring of these exper-
imental plants to record data on germination success,
survival, growth, reproductive success, as well as life
history and morphological traits. We conduct most of
our work in the eld, with a small proportion of indoor
lab work.
The successful candidate will assist with ongoing eld-
work. In addition, there are many opportunities for
students to develop independent projects associated
with our overall objectives, including studies on: 1)
population divergence in ecologically-relevant traits, es-86 EvolDir April 1, 2016
pecially drought, UV tolerance, and herbivore resistance;
2) phenotypic plasticity at multiple spatial scales; 3)
population density and species composition of the her-
bivore community that attacks Drummond's rockcress;
4) ower color polymorphism; and 5) the importance
of maternal eects in biological responses to climate
change.
We are oering a stipend of $500/week for a full time
REU student (40 hours/week) for 10 weeks. The exact
start and end dates are exible.
We will cover room and board at the Rocky Mountain
Biological Laboratory and reimburse travel expenses up
to $500. Fieldwork will involve hiking to experimental
gardens through rough terrain (1-3 miles one-way daily).
The University of Georgia is committed to maintaining
a fair and respectful environment for living, work, and
study. To that end, all qualied applicants from individ-
uals with a strong interest in evolutionary biology will
receive consideration for employment without regard to
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orien-
tation, gender identity, disability status, or age. The
application consists of a cover letter your qualications,
a CV/ r esum e and contact information for two refer-
ences, all of which can be emailed to Dr. Jill Anderson
at: jta24@uga.edu Applications are due by April 1st,
2016.
Feel free to contact Jill or Susana (susanaw@uga.edu)
if you have any questions about the position. Addi-
tional information about the our work can be found

CIRAD France VirusPopGenetics
We are seeking a post-doc fellow to investigate
potential adaptive mechanisms behind the ability of
viruses transmitted by arthropod vectors to infect
cyclically both mammals and arthropods. To that
end, you will analyse how the genetics of Bluetongue
virus populations changes while they switch between
mammals and insects hosts. This funded project will
use bioinformatic analysis of NGS data generated from
infections of mammals and insect vectors as well as
experimental evolution of viral populations in cell
culture. We will consider candidates able to conduct
both bioinformatic and experimental approaches, as
well as those autonomous in one and willing to develop
its skills in the other. The candidate will work in our
fully equipped labs in Montpellier - South of France,

**
*Project METHIS:*
*METHIS: Inuence of admixture histories on the ge-
netic evolution of hybrid populations.*
The METHIS project aims to develop a novel com-
prehensive population-genetic framework for studying,
reconstructing, and predicting how complex historical
admixture processes inuence genetic diversity and evo-
lution of hybrid populations.
*The post-doctorate candidate will be mainly in charge
of developing (and ultimately releasing to the commu-
nity) a exible forward-in-time simulator of genome-
wide genetic data*, based on the mechanistic admixture
models developed in Verdu and Rosenberg /Genetics/
2011. This simulator shall be used to investigate, a
priori, the evolution of genetic diversity in hybrid pop-
ulations experiencing complex histories of admixture.
Furthermore, *the simulator will be integrated into an
Approximate Bayesian Computation framework that
will be specically adapted to infer the parameters of
the historical admixture processes* that gave rise to
hybrid populations, using genetic data.
*The candidate will be able to apply this new methodol-
ogy to two \real life" case-studies.*First, using available
genetic data, the post-doctorate candidate will be able
to apply the new methodology to *reconstruct and pre-
dict the inuence of admixture processes on the survival
and adaptation of /Arenaria grandiora/.* This plant
species is targeted by a hybrid re-introduction program
conducted since 1999 in the Fontainebleau forest to re-
store its nearly extinct population, and more than 600
samples gathered in 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2015 have
already been genotyped to monitor the genetic diversity
of the re-introduced populations.
Second, we will investigate recent histories of admixture
in human populations. In particular, the post doctorate
candidate will be able to apply the new simulator and
ABC tools to *reconstruct, from genome-wide data,*
*how variable admixture histories inuenced the genomic
diversity of admixed populations that arose, on dierentApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 91
sides of the Atlantic, during the history of European
colonization and the Atlantic Slave Trade.* This case
study will focus on *publically available genome-wide
data *from African, European, Caribbean and Ameri-
can populations (including admixed Barbadian, Puerto
Rican and Columbian populations), *as well as novel
genome-wide data* for 400 individuals (75 are already
available in the lab) *from Cape Verde* generated dur-
ing the project METHIS.
**
*Required abilities:*
Candidates are expected to have a strong background in
population genetics/genomics principles and statistical
tools, as well as extensive programming skills. Ideally,
candidates should have prior experience with ABC and
genetic data analysis at the genome-wide scale.

GeorgiaTech Evol Biol
The Paaby lab at Georgia Tech is seeking a creative
and enthusiastic postdoctoral scholar in evolutionary
biology, with an anticipated start date in fall 2016 or
spring 2017.
Our lab explores the evolution of complex traits using
genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, genomics andeld work. Our strength is using creative engineering
approaches to test the functional consequences of natu-
ral genetic variation. (For more information, please visit
my website: http://genaamics.org/.) The successful
candidate will be a critical thinker pursuing research in
evolutionary genetics, quantitative genetics or evo-devo
and have a PhD in one of these, or a related, area.
The research project will include both experimental
benchwork and computational research or analysis and
will be dened jointly by the postdoc and myself, An-
nalise Paaby. The project could originate entirely from
the candidate, from an existing project in the lab (which
currently includes research in C. elegans and related
Caenorhabditis species), or it could be something in be-
tween. The postdoc will be free to develop an indepen-
dent research program with the support and expertise
of the lab.
WHY GEORGIA TECH?
The School of Biology at Georgia Tech is a medium-sized
department with an outstanding group of evolutionary
biologists. We include at least seven highly interac-
tive labs with a primary focus on the genetic basis of
evolutionary dynamics, and additional labs using com-
putational approaches in evolutionary genomics or eld-
and lab-based approaches in ecological genetics. Lo-
cated within a world-class engineering institute, we have
truly unique opportunities for collaboration, especially
for experimental model systems.
WHY ATLANTA?
Atlanta is a lush, green city with loads of restaurants
and great quality of life. The city oers all the perks of
a major metropolis but is aordable. The North Geor-
gia mountains are only an hour's drive and the region
includes some of the most beautiful outdoor landscapes
on the east coast.
WHY THE PAABY LAB?
My lab is new (established fall 2015) and what I can't yet
oer in reputation I aim to make up for as an engaged
colleague! I am committed to working productively
with all members of my lab and I enjoy opportunities
to mentor the development of independent researchers.
HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE PAABY?
It's \poe-bee".
WANT TO APPLY?
The most important criterion of the successful candidate
is demonstrated enthusiasm and aptitude for scholar-
ship in evolutionary biology. If this sounds like you,

An NSF-funded postdoctoral position investigating milk-
weed (Asclepias) phylogenomics is available in the
Straub Lab at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in96 EvolDir April 1, 2016
Geneva, New York. The diversity of Asclepias in North
America is the product of a recent, rapid evolutionary
radiation. Because milkweed species diversied over

evolutionary relationships requires genome-scale data.
Targeted sequencing of the nuclear genome of Asclepias
combined with sampling of many individuals per species
will allow us to distinguish common causes of gene tree
discordance: incomplete lineage sorting and introgres-
sion. The postdoc on this project will be responsible for

THREE POSTDOC POSITIONS IN EVO DEVO AND
ECO DEVO OF HORNED BEETLES
(Moczek-Lab, Indiana University, Bloomington)
Three (3) full-time postdoctoral positions are available
in Armin Moczek's lab, Department of Biology, Indiana
University, Bloomington. Our lab conducts research in
the evolutionary developmental (evo-devo) and ecolog-
ical developmental (eco-devo) biology of insects. We
focus on the genetic, developmental, and ecological mech-
anisms, and their interactions, that mediate the origins
and diversication of novel complex traits (such as beetle
horns, rey lanterns, or treehopper helmets) and func-
tions (such as nutrition-responsive development, sexual
dimorphisms, or alternative reproductive tactics).
The rst position will focus on identifying the genes and
pathways underlying the origin and diversication of
horns in the extraordinarily diverse beetle genus On-
thophagus. Specically, the work will use genomic
and candidate-gene approaches to identify and func-
tionally characterize the developmental-genetic mecha-
nisms that regulate horn morphology (size, shape, posi-
tion), context-dependent expression of horns (sex- and
nutrition-specicity), and how evolutionary changes in
these mechanisms have mediated diversication within
and among species.
The second position will utilize diverse horned beetle
species and populations to explore the role of devel-
opmental plasticity in facilitating, biasing, or hinder-
ing phenotypic evolution. Focusing on morphological
and physiological phenotypes, this work will combine
genomic, transcriptomic, and candidate-pathway ap-
proaches to contrast ancestral and descendant patterns
of gene expression and function in natural as well as
mesocosm populations.
The third position will explore the relative signicances
of - and interactions among - the horned beetle mi-
crobiome, niche construction behaviors, and nematode
symbionts in the ecological radiation of horned beetles.
This work will combine genomic, transcriptomic, and
candidate-pathway approaches in both beetles and ne-
matodes to characterize the role of co-development in
the ecology and evolution of dung beetles, and the de-
velopmental mechanisms and evolutionary consequences
of interspecic epistasis.April 1, 2016 EvolDir 97
All postdoctoral candidates would have opportunities
to develop additional independent lines of research in
these and related areas.
We seek three collegial, self-motivated, independent,
and intellectually curious individuals with recent PhDs
in Evolutionary Biology, Developmental Biology, or re-
lated elds. Applicants for either position must have
strong bench skills, and familiarity with techniques
such as RNAinterference, qPCR, cloning, immuno-
histochemistry, and the bioinformatic analyses of next-
gen sequencing data is strongly desirable (though train-
ing in these techniques will also be provided as neces-
sary). In addition, candidates must have demonstrated
written and oral communication skills. Experience work-
ing with insects is helpful but not required. All three
positions are initially available for 24 months, with pos-
sible extension for a third year funds permitting. Salary
will be commensurate with experience, and full benets
are included.
Indiana University has a large and interactive group at
the interface of evolutionary and developmental biology
and ecology. Bloomington is situated in scenic, hilly
southern Indiana, near several parks and wilderness
areas. The cultural environment provided by the Uni-
versity is exceptionally rich in art, music, and theater.

EvolutionOfPersonality
Postdoc required for research on the mechanisms under-
lying variation in animal personality
Job description:
Dr. Hanne L ~Avlie, Link oping University (IFM Biology),
is looking to recruit a strong postdoctoral candidate
in evolutionary biology. The job description primarily
entails analysing and writing up existing data on the
underlying mechanisms of variation in personality in
the 3-spine stickleback, together with developing further
research on the same topic.
Animal personality (i.e. consistent individual be-
havioural responses), has recently received considerableresearch attention. Despite this, fundamental questions
remain unanswered, such as why variation in personality
arises, and how polymorphism is maintained?
The postdoc will have access to existing data on brain
physiology, and gene expression exploring the role of
the brain monoaminergic systems (i.e. serotonin and
dopamine) underlying variation in personality. The
stickleback is a particularly suitable species to investi-
gate personality because of the potential to combine
existing understanding of behaviour, physiology and
genetics, with the application of a strong experimental
design. However, the topic of the project is relatively
exible and can be tailored to t the skills and in-
terests of the successful candidate. The project is in
collaboration with Professor Svante Winberg (Uppsala
University).
Requirements:
The successful applicant will be a highly motivated and
well-merited candidate with a PhD and potentially also
postdoc experience in evolutionary biology, behavioural
ecology, neurobiology or similar. Research experience in
experimental animal behaviour, good statistical knowl-
edge and analytical ability are merits, as is strong ex-
perience in scientic writing. Very good knowledge of
written and oral English is required. Both good co-
operation skills and the ability to work independently
are emphasised. Experience of sh as model is also
benecial.
What we oer:
Link oping University is a modern university with a vi-
brant and growing biology division. A major research
focus at the biology division is animal behaviour, in-
cluding behavioural genetics and genomics. Link oping
is located in central Sweden, only a couple of hours
from several other university cities, such as Stockholm,
Uppsala and Lund.
Opportunities to gain experience in the supervision of
students and other teaching is possible, but not required.
Start date:
Suggested starting date is 1st of June 2016, but this is
exible.
Funding:
According to present rates at the university, postdoc
stipends (where no tax will be deduced) are 25 000
SEK per month. The stipend does not give entitle-
ment to sickness benet, parental allowance, holiday
pay or pension. Funding is so far secured for the start
up of the project and 50% of the stipend for a period
of 2 years. The suitable candidate will apply together
with Dr L ~Avlie for the remaining funding, with suitableApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 101
opportunities available already from 15/4.
Application procedure:
The application should include a 1-2 page cover letter
describing your research experience and interests, and
your interest in the project, and a full CV (including
name and contact details of 2 references who are willing
to provide letters of support). The application should

MosquitoMatingBehaviour
Postdoctoral position for a Bio-engineer on insect acous-
tic behavior in malaria mosquitoes
A 2 year postdoctoral position in insect acoustic be-
haviour is available within the Anofeel project funded
by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)
and hosted by the Research Institute for Development
(IRD, Mivegec Lab, Montpellier, France), in collabora-
tion with the IRSS (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso) and
the NRI (Greenwich University, Kent, UK). The Anofeel
project aims at investigating the mating behavior of
malaria mosquitoes using state-of-the-art synchronized
3D video and audio recording devices.
Scientic context: Malarial mosquitoes are the most
dangerous animal on Earth; they kill more humans than
any other animal. Prof. G. Gibson at the NRI and
colleagues at the University of Brighton have discovered
that mosquitoes use acoustic cues in a unique way to
identify and locate mates. The aim of the project is to102 EvolDir April 1, 2016
discover how this novel behavior might be exploited to
control or even eradicate these deadly insects. For ex-
ample, the development of sterile male release strategies
to control mosquito populations highlights the neces-
sity of producing competitive males which will require
a detailed analysis of their acoustic capabilities. The
ndings of the project will also be used to develop new
control and monitoring strategies.
Observing mating behavior is technically challenging,
as it occurs in mid-ight within a volume ~1 m3 and in
virtual darkness. Prof. Gibson has developed a record-
ing studio designed to mimic the natural lighting and
atmospheric conditions mosquitoes encounter during
mating ights, and instrumented the space with 3D
video recording and high-quality acoustic recording to
document every stage of mating behavior. An experi-
enced bio-engineer is required to operate the equipment,
to design and construct modications as required for
this project and to write code for capturing and ana-
lyzing the video and audio recordings. The Post doc
will also be required to set up similar equipment at the
IRSS research centre in Burkina Faso, West Africa to
build capacity in the eld for similar experiments where
there is access to wild populations of mosquitoes.
The postdoc fellow will work on acoustic cues emitted by
males swarm at the NRI under Prof. Gabriella Gibson's
supervision. She/He will conduct the following studies:
 - Characterise male swarms; record the ight paths
of individual mosquitoes in 3D and the simultaneous
sounds they emit by their ight-tones.  - Determine
the distance of attraction to swarms for males and fe-
males.  - Test the eects of pure tones within the range
of male and female ight-tones to determine whether
pure sounds can trigger similar responses.  - If it can be
shown that mosquitoes hear swarms, arrangements will
be made with the University of Brighton to conduct key
investigations of the sensory physiology underlying this
acoustic behavior.  - The Postdoc will be expected to
contribute to the maintenance of the equipment related
to the project and assist with rearing the mosquitoes
used in the project.  - The Postdoc will make one - two
eld trips to Burkina Faso to test for biological activity
of recorded sounds in semi-eld and eld conditions and
to assist with setting up a swarming studio equipped
with 3D video recording for use by co-PIs on other tasks
of the project.

Project Title: Reconstructing the history of epigenetic
divergence and transposon activity in Macaronesian
Arabidopsis
Location: Max Planck Institute of Plant Breeding Re-
search (MPIPZ), Cologne, Germany
Project Description: Large-scale structural variation
mediated by transposons and epigenetic variation may
enhance adaptive potential and underlie episodes of
rapid adaptation in nature. Arabidopsis thaliana is
widespread across Eurasia, but is also found in otherApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 103
locations worldwide. The population from Cape Verde
has been especially intriguing because of the extreme
climate, which is dened by a long and severe dry season.
Only a single strain has been available from this region,
but based on years of study, we know this strain is diver-
gent from other strains for a broad range of organismal
phenotypes. It is therefore particularly interesting that
this accession is also divergent for methylation and het-
erochromatin phenotypes and suggests a possible link
between phenotypic and epigenetic divergence.
The goal of this project is to retrace the evolutionary
history of epigenetic divergence of Cape Verde Arabidop-
sis and identify associated organismal phenotypes. This
project will make use of RNA-seq, bs-seq and genomic
data sets (using data from Illumina and PacBio plat-
forms) and phenotypic data generated in our lab.
Research Environment: Research in the Hancock Lab is
funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and
Max Planck Institute (MPI) and focuses on understand-
ing the molecular basis of evolutionary processes. For
more information about work in the lab, see http:/-

stitute houses 25 research groups, its own Genome Cen-
ter with cutting-edge PacBio and Illumina sequencing
capabilities, Mass-Spec facility, Biomolecule Screening
Center and Central Microscopy Center.
The MPIPZ is part of a larger network of plant and
evolutionary biologists from the University of Cologne
and Heinrich Heine University in D usseldorf, and it is a
member of (CEPLAS), a regional cluster of excellence

be ideal. English is the working language of the labora-
tory and the institute, so excellent communication skills
in English are imperative.
The position is for two years with the possibility of ex-

Post-doctoral Position in Plant Systems Biology
Project: NSF - NutriNet: A network inspired approach
to improving NUE in crops.
New York University Center for Genomics and Systems
Biology
A post-doctoral position at NYU's Center for Genomics
and Systems Biology - in the laboratory of Dr. Gloria
Coruzzi - is available as part of our NSF Plant Genome
Grant entitled: NutriNet: A network inspired approach
to improving Nutrient Use Eciency (NUE) in crop
plants.
The successful applicant will have skills and experi-
ence in Plant Biology and Genomics. The position
will require experimental skills for the generation of
-omics datasets such as DNA/RNA isolation, Next-gen
sequencing library construction, plant growth (Arabidop-
sis and Maize) etc. Additionally, working knowledge
of R, Python or other programming language is highly
desirable. This position also includes Project Man-
agement duties, which involve coordinating scientic
activities at two participating institutions; organizing
group meetings, writing grant reports, paper writing and
communicating our work in conferences and meetings.
This project involves the collaboration three institutions.
PI: Gloria Coruzzi (PI), NYU, Center for Genomics &
Systems Biology (plant genomics); Dennis Shasha (co-
PI) NYU, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences
(bioinformatics); & Stephen Moose (co-PI) U. Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign (maize functional genomics).
Overview: Recent advances in genome sequencing, func-
tional genomics, and computational tools enable a
systems-level understanding of key physiological and104 EvolDir April 1, 2016
developmental processes in the model plant Arabidopsis,
but translating this knowledge to enhancing agricul-
turally important phenotypes in crop species remains
challenging. The goal of our NutriNet project is to de-
velop network-connected modules in crops- exploiting
Arabidopsis network knowledge - that are predictive
of phenotypic variation and enhance the eciency of
genetic gain in crop species, using nutrient use eciency
(NUE) of maize as the target trait. Four aims are pro-
posed to achieve these goals. First, new and existing
data for nutrient-responsive gene expression proles will
be integrated with phenotypic variation for NUE to
develop a training set that exploits the power of genetic
diversity from both Arabidopsis (Coruzzi, NYU) and
maize (Moose, Illinois). Second, a split-root experi-
mental design combined with RNASeq (Coruzzi) will
identify Arabidopsis and maize genes that function in
root-shoot N-signaling and that control root foraging for
nutrients. The third aim is to construct the NutriNet for
maize (Coruzzi/Shasha, NYU), which will be combined
with Arabidopsis ???network knowledge???? to dene
network modules predictive of NUE traits. NutriNet
modules will be validated using ???left-out data' and
tests of predictive ability in genotypes outside of the
initial training set. Finally, information derived from
NutriNet modules will be used to select individual geno-
types that possess optimal NutriNet congurations from
diverse germplasm pools, which will then be evaluated
for improved NUE traits in the lab (Arabidopsis) and
eld (maize). A comparative analysis of lab-to-eld
results will directly assess the ???translation???? of
knowledge from Arabidopsis to cereal crops.
Application: Please send cover letter, re-
sume and 3 letters of reference by email to:

*Predicting the adaptive potential of the endangered
New Zealand hihi (stitchbird; Notiomystis cincta)*
We are pleased to oer an 18 month postdoctoral fellow-
ship, funded by a Marsden Fund Grant, with Dr Anna
Santure in the School of Biological Sciences, University
of Auckland, New Zealand. This project is an exciting
opportunity to use statistical genetic approaches to un-
derstand and predict the evolutionary potential of the
endangered New Zealand hihi (stitchbird; *Notiomystis
cincta*), and is a collaboration with Dr Patricia Brekke
and Dr John Ewen at the Institute of Zoology, Zoologi-
cal Society of London, see www.hihiconservation.com .
Determining the adaptive potential of wild populations
requires that we understand the genetic basis of traits
that are important for survival and reproduction in these110 EvolDir April 1, 2016
populations. We are developing a genomic toolkit to
characterise the genetic basis of morphological and life
history traits in the reintroduced Tiritiri Matangi Island
population of hihi, in order to understand the potential
of the species to respond to changing environmental
pressures, including anthropogenic climate change. Hihi
are an ideal study system because, in addition to being
a wonderful example of eccentric New Zealand wildlife,
a reintroduced population of birds on Tiritiri Matangi
Island has been intensively monitored since introduction
and we have a wealth of data on morphological and life
history traits, social and genetic relationships, DNA
samples and environmental variables. The postdoctoral
fellow will be responsible for quantifying selection on
morphological and life history traits, and investigating
heritabilities and genetic trade-os between traits that
may constrain the adaptive potential of the species. The
postdoc will also have the opportunity to contribute to
linkage mapping and association analysis, and there is
potential to examine signatures of selection in the draft
hihi genome and test the impact of drift versus selection
on the population.
We are looking for a candidate with a strong background
in quantitative and / or theoretical population genetics,
as well as a passion for evolution and conservation biol-
ogy and a track record of publishing in leading journals.
Candidates with experience in comparative genomics,
statistics, bioinformatics, mathematics, computer pro-
gramming or similar are also encouraged to apply.
The postdoctoral fellowship is available with a salary
range of approximately NZD $79,159- $84,931 de-
pending on experience, the start date is negotiable
but ideally before September 2016. We welcome
informal enquiries, please contact Anna Santure at

SymbioticBacteria
Variation and transmission patterns of symbiotic micro-
bial communities associated with wood-feeding insects
A 18-months postdoctoral position is available in the
Insect Biology Research Institute at the University
Fran ~A^A-Rabelais in Tours (France). The postdoc fel-
low will participate to the Xylobiotic project funded
by the ~A^ a:AR~A^AcgionCentreV aldeLoire ~A^a: ?`12.
This project aims to investigate the role of symbiotic
microbial communities in the invasion success and dy-
namics of wood-feeding insect species. The candidatewill work in close collaboration with several entomol-
ogists, evolutionary biologists and ecologists who are
involved in this research project.
Scientic objectives
The specic aim of the postdoc is to investigate the evo-
lutionary dynamics of the Symbiotic Microbial Commu-
nities (SMC) associated to the hindgut of subterranean
termites and to the mycangia of ambrosia beetles. More
specically, this project aims: (i) to study the diver-
sity and composition of the SMC associated to these
insects, (ii) to analyze the intra and inter-population
variations of the SMC, (iii) to determine the eciency
of vertical transmission of the symbionts (from par-
ents to ospring), and (iv) to test the possibility that
symbionts can be horizontally transferred between host
species (host-switching events). This research will prin-
cipally involve analyses of high-throughput sequencing
of microbial barcoding regions (rRNA 16S for prokary-
otes, 18S for protists, ITS for fungi) isolated from insect
tissues.
Candidate prole
The postdoc fellow will be in charge to lead all the DNA
metabarcoding data analyses. We therefore are looking
for candidates with a background in evolutionary ge-
nomics and/or microbial ecology with a high skill level
in bioinformatics. The ideal candidate will demonstrate
the ability to analyze Illumina sequence data sets, and
use high throughput sequencing data to characterize
and interpret the diversity and structure of microbial
communities. An experience in analyzing meta-genomes
and/or transcriptomes will also be highly valuable.
Environment
Our Institute is a unit of the ~ACentre National de
la Recherche Scientique ~Athat provides a stimulat-
ing environment, including a rich spectrum of research
activities in life sciences related to the insects (http://-
irbi.univ-tours.fr). Tours is a mid-sized French city, well
connected to Paris and Bordeaux and oering a broad
range of cultural and recreational activities (http://-
www.tours-tourism.co.uk).
Schedule
The postdoc position ideally will start in September
2016, although some arrangements eventually could be
made. Applications will contain a CV, a cover letter
describing candidate background and interests, a de-
scription of previous research experiences, and contact
names and emails for two letters of reference. Complete
application les must be sent to Dr Franck Dedeine
(franck.dedeine@univ-tours.fr) as soon as possible and
before June 13 ^th. Pre-selected candidates might thenApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 117

Post-Doc in Evolutionary Analysis of Gene Regulation
We seek a highly motivated and creative individual to
join our Bioinformatics for Molecular Biology and Ge-
nomics research group at Department of Biosciences,
University of Helsinki, Finland.
*Project Description:
In this project, biological experimentation is combined
with methods development to estimate conserved gene
regulatory networks. Initial application area is evolution
of leaf formation. Leaves are optimal for the purpose,
since they are easy to quantify in large amounts with
several replicates per individual, they vary between
and within species, and there exists a large amount of
publicly available gene expression data from leaf de-
velopment in dierent species. In addition to public
data, leaf formation is studied in a large birch pop-
ulation (family Betulaceae) which is characterised in
a high-throughput plant phenotyping facility, followed
by genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of selected
phenotypes.
*Research Environment:
Research is carried out in Bioinformatics for Molecular
Biology and Genomics research group headed by D.Sc
Jarkko Saloj arvi. The group is focusing on plant systems
biology by combining dierent omics data to study the
evolution and adaptation of gene regulation in plants.
The group is part of Finnish Center of Excellence in
Molecular Biology of Primary Producers, and housed
within the Viikki Biocentre campus of University of
Helsinki. The campus has exceptional research facil-
ities, including state-of-the-art core facilities such as
next generation sequencing platforms (Illumina HiSeq,
PacBio), plant growth chambers, greenhouses, and a
high-throughput plant phenotyping facility.
*Required Qualications and Application Instructions:The candidate should have experience or necessary skills
to learn machine learning or advanced statistics, and/or
population genomics, and programming/scripting expe-
rience (preferably R). Previous background of working in
a Linux environment with genomic and transcriptomic
data analysis is needed. The working language of the
group is English, and therefore excellent communication
skills in English are imperative.
The position is for two years, and salary is according
to the University salary system, which is based on qual-
ications and personal performance. A post-doctoral
fellow will likely be at level 5 (salary before taxes 3100-
3700 Euro/ month). Preferable starting time is August
2016, but is exible.
To apply, please send a letter of motivation describing
your reasons for applying to the position, CV, tran-
scripts and contact details for at least two references.
All materials should be sent in English to

*Position 1: Genomics of adaptive radiations*
The main objective of the rst position is to analyse
the genomic elements involved in the adaptive radiation
of clownsh to better understand the genetic mecha-
nisms that are responsible for the specialisation of this
iconic group of organisms. In a second step, full genome
and transcriptome data will be used jointly with the
phylogenetic context to assess the presence of parallel
patterns of genomic change that lead to phenotypic di-
versication of clownshes. This will allow to assess if
comparable mechanisms are at play between the micro-
and macro-evolutionary scales.
Prole requirements: The ideal candidate should be an
autonomous and ambitious person with enthusiasm for
inter-disciplinary work, who will need to interact produc-
tively with evolutionary biologists, genome biologists

A theoretical evolutionary biology postdoctoral position
for 1 year (extensible for 2 more years) is open in the
research group of Laurent Lehmann at the Department
of Ecology and Evolution of the University of Lausanne
(https://www.unil.ch/dee). We study social evolution
from a mathematical and computational point of view
with a current focus on human evolution and address
the following type of questions:
How did large-scale stratied human societies emerge
from small-scale egalitarian societies? Is this the result
of an increase in the technologies of production and
exchange (invention of agriculture and trading) or in
the technology of appropriation (intensication of war-
fare)? What are the selection pressures on increased
lifespan and cognition in the human lineage? Is this the
result of an ecological or a social pressure? How does
the determinants of behavior evolve in social environ-
ments? Should behavior be genetically driven, acquired
by social learning, or is free choice of actions delegated
to the individual?
Applicants with a strong interest in these research ques-April 1, 2016 EvolDir 119
tions are encouraged to apply. Applicants should have a
Ph.D. in a relevant area (e.g. evolutionary biology, eco-
nomics, anthropology, physics, or mathematics), with
strong mathematical and computing skills, and a vivid
interest in fundamental research.
Inquiries and applications should be sent to lau-
rent.lehmann@unil.ch by April 31th. They should in-
clude a CV, a statement of research interests, and names
of 2-3 referees. Only applications with all these infor-
mation will be considered. Starting date is negotiable,

Job Description:
Main objective of the project Comparative Infection
Biology (COMPI) is the genomic investigation of
pathogenic species in the Yersinia genus using ancient
DNA (aDNA) techniques, high-throughput sequencing
methods and related bioinformatics. The Yersinia genus
comprises an assemblage of diverse pathogens capable
of infecting vertebrates in terrestrial and marine ecosys-
tems. Nonetheless, the evolutionary and ecological pro-
cesses underlying the epidemiology of these pathogens
remain debated. The project includes investigations
on Y. pestis, responsible for all known historic plague
pandemics and Y. ruckeri, a marine pathogen aecting
various sh species. Using a multidisciplinary approach,
involving paleogenomics, climatological and ecological
data we aim to understand spatial and temporal trajec-
tories of Yersinia speciesin the past. A core component
of the project is the aDNA analysis of ancient samples,
including medieval human remains and historical sh
collections, for identication and phylogenetic analy-
sis of Yersinia (and other pathogens). Datasets from
historic Atlantic cod specimens have been generated
and are available for analysis. Comparative studies
of population dynamics and pathogenicity factors of
the bacteria will provide a better understanding of the
biological processes underlying bacterial infection.
The successful candidate will work in close collaboration
with a multi-disciplinary group of international recog-
nized experts from the elds of microbiology, ecology,
genomics and evolution from the teams of CEES (led byNils Chr Stenseth), COMPI (Dirk Linke, PI) and Med-

EvolutionReproductiveBehaviour
POST DOC: Reproductive behaviours in a risky world:
are mothers trading-o ospring safety for future t-
ness?
Background
Individuals do not only have to eat without been eaten,
they also have to balance the risk of mortality with
their investment into reproduction. We study trade-os
between reproductive and anti-predatory behaviours.
Rodents are a suitable study system: they are highly
depredated, have exible mating system (i.e. can mate
singly or multiply), and can potentially simultaneously
invest into nestling litters (current investment) and preg-
nancy (future investment). This produces a conict
between caring for the current ospring, and leaving
the ospring temporally behind for mating in order
to be able to invest into future ospring. It further
allows to separate the eects of predation risk on dif-
ferent stages in the life cycle on the trade-o between
current reproductive investment (nest guarding) and
future reproductive investment (mating behaviour). In
our experiments individual variation in time allocation,
physiological responses, space use and mating success
will be monitored allowing quantifying both behavioural
and tness consequences. Experiments are conducted
in dierent spatial and temporal scales: behavioural
observations in the laboratory and automated teleme-
try observations in semi-natural enclosures, allowing
for novel estimates of the general exibility of repro-
ductive behaviour and measureing life-history trade-os
of reproduction and mortality risk for individuals in
semi-natural settings. Experimental data either already
exists or has to be collected. The post-doc is expected
to work with and publish this data.Research Environment
Our (all female) research group \Animal Ecology"at the
University of Potsdam consist of three scientists (Eccard
and Dammhahn, Behavioural Ecology, Scheer, Human
Biology) and two technicians. We run large outdoor
facilities with enclosures and automated telemetry and
a behavioural research facility. We part of the Pots-
dam/Berlin research Area with several universities and
research institutions. Currently we supervise 8 PhD
projects in Behavior/Evolution/Conservation (see our
homepage). Our strengths are experimental approaches
and statistical modelling. Potsdam is a beautiful town
20km southwest of Berlin and great to live an work in.

Postdoc position in Evolutionary Ecology
at the University of Zurich, Switzerland
A postdoctoral position in evolutionary ecology, of 18
months duration, is available at the University of Zurich
working with Prof Hanna Kokko and her international
team www.kokkonuts.org . This research group is also
part of a Centre of Excellence in Biological Interactions,
which will bring the postdoc in contact with Univer-
sities of Helsinki and Jyv askyl a in Finland (https://-
www.jyu./bioenv/en/divisions/coe-interactions). The
research involves theoretical studies related to life his-
tory questions in modular organisms, a question that
can be framed within the general context of the evo-
lution of multicellularity. There is also potential to
collaborate with Will Ratcli's group at Georgia Tech122 EvolDir April 1, 2016
(http://www.ratcliab.biology.gatech.edu/).
We are a team that places a lot of emphasis on creat-
ing theoretical work that integrates well with empirical
ndings. The most up to date version of our current
interests can be best described by the list of journal club
articles that we discuss each week (www.kokkonuts.org ,
click on ^ ajournal club'). We are looking for a researcher
who combines a broad interested in the research areas
described there, with a specic interest of developing
theory for life histories of organisms that do not t
the classical assumptions of much of modelling (such
as discrete generations, clear distinction between germ
line and soma, clear boundaries between individuals).
Applicants should come with a strong set of theoretical
skills. Applicants who are adept at generating research
ideas - as long as they fall within the broad scope of our
focal topics as implicitly dened by the journal club -
are preferred over those who expect a clearly delineated
project to be given to them.
The working language in the group is English (Germanskills are not essential). The position is available from
mid-year 2016. The target application date is March
31, 2016, but open until a suitable candidate has been
found.
Applicants should send a cover letter with a
- statement of their research interests, especially in rela-
tion to the journal club articles as mentioned above
- C.V. (including publication list), and
- the names and contact details of at least one referee.

Boston Plant microMORPH
Reminder! Applications due March 15.
Due to overwhelming interest, plant morphology has re-
turned as the topic for the fourth annual microMORPH
summer short course at the Arnold Arboretum. This
short course will be taught by experts from around the
world as an intense, two-week lecture, laboratory, and
living collections learning experience. The course will be
based at the Weld Hill Research Building at the Arnold
Arboretum in Boston, which oers a state-of-the-art
microscopy laboratory for teaching and sits amid the
15,000+ living specimens of more than 2,200 species at
the Arnold Arboretum.
This course will provide a working knowledge of tools
and concepts that are central to understanding the devel-
opmental basis for the remarkable structural and func-
tional diversity of plants. Topics include developmental
dynamics, evolutionary diversication, and ecological
and physiological function. Ultimately, this course aims
to provide the skills necessary to interpret the vast array
of morphologies that exist among plants. Each day will
consist of lecture and laboratory sessions, with ample
opportunity to explore the Arnold Arboretum.
The microMORPH and Arnold Arboretum summer
short courses are free for all participants, and funds
are available to help defray costs of participant travel.

organized by Rita Ponce and Teresa Nogueira j18-22
April 2016 @ Lisbon, Portugal
Objectives: In this course we will explore evolutionary
change at the molecular level. We will focus on the ori-
gin of genomic variability and the forces that drive the
evolutionary process at molecular level, as well as origin
of novel gene functions and genome organization. We
will integrate the knowledge from molecular evolution
to other levels, such as cell biology, physiology and the
relationship of genotype to phenotype and will address
several applications. Part of the course will involve
the discussion of both classical and recent papers and
hand-on analysis of case studies.

Glasgow Linux workows Aug15-19
Glasgow.LNUXworkows.Aug15-19
Course: ntroduction to LINUX workows for biologists
nstructor: Dr. Martin Jones
This course will run from 15th - 19th August 2016
at SCENE (the Scottish Centre for Ecology and the
Natural Environment), Loch Lomond National Park,
Glasgow.
Course overview: Most high-throughput bioinformatics
work these days takes place on the Linux command line.128 EvolDir April 1, 2016
The programs which do the majority of the computa-
tional heavy lifting ^ a genome assemblers, read mappers,
and annotation tools ^ a are designed to work best when
used with a command-line interface. Because the com-
mand line can be an intimidating environment, many
biologists learn the bare minimum needed to get their
analysis tools working. This means that they miss out
on the power of Linux to customize their environment
and automate many parts of the bioinformatics work-
ow. This course will introduce the Linux command
line environment from scratch and teach students how
to make the most of its tools to achieve a high level of
productivity when working with biological data.
Availability: 15 places total.
Course programme
Monday 15th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
^ a Session 1 - The design of Linux
n the rst session we briey cover the design of Linux:
how is it dierent from Windows/OSX and how is it
best used? We'll then jump straight onto the command
line and learn about the layout of the Linux lesystem
and how to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's le per-
mission system (which often trips up beginners), how
paths work, and how we actually run programs on the
command line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the
command line more eciently, and how to deal with
programs that are misbehaving. We'll nish this session
by looking at the built in help system and how to read
and interpret manual pages.
^ a Session 2 - System management
We'll rst look at a few command line tools for mon-
itoring the status of the system and keeping track of
what's happening to processor power, memory, and disk
space. We'll go over the process of installing new soft-
ware from the built in repositories (which is easy) and
from source code downloads (which is trickier). We'll
also introduce some tools for benchmarking software
(measuring the time/memory requirements of processing
large datasets).
Tuesday 16th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
^ a Session 3 - Manipulating tabular data
Many data types we want to work with in bioinformat-
ics are stored as tabular plain text les, and here we
learn all about manipulating tabular data on the com-
mand line. We'll start with simple things like extracting
columns, ltering and sorting, searching for text before
moving on to more complex tasks like searching for du-
plicated values, summarizing large les, and combiningsimple tools into long commands.
^ a Session 4 - Constructing pipelines
n this session we will look at the various tools Linux has
for constructing pipelines out of individual commands.
Aliases, shell redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will
all be introduced here. We'll also look at a couple of
specic tools to help with running tools on multiple pro-
cessors, and for monitoring the progress of long running
tasks.
Wednesday 17th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
^ a Session 5 - EMBOSS
EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformatics command-line
tools explicitly designed to work in the Linux paradigm.
We'll get an overview of the dierent sequence data
formats that we might expect to work with, and put
what we learned about shell scripting to biological use
by building a pipeline to compare codon usage across
two collections of DNA sequences.
^ a Session 6 - Using a Linux server
Often in bioinformatics we'll be working on a Linux
server rather than our own computer^ a typically because
we need access to more computing power, or to special-
ized tools and datasets. n this session we'll learn how to
connect to a Linux server and how to manage sessions.
We'll also consider the various ways of moving data to
and from a server from your own computer, and nish
with a discussion of the considerations we have to make
when working on a shared computer.
Thursday 18th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
^ a Session 7 - Combining methods
n the next two sessions ^ a i.e. one full day ^ a we'll put
everything we have learned together and implement a
workow for next-gen sequence analysis. n this rst ses-
sion we'll carry out quality control on some paired-end
llumina data and map these reads to a reference genome.
We'll then look at various approaches to automating
this pipeline, allowing us to quickly do the same for a
second dataset.
^ a Session 8 - Combining methods
The second part of the next-gen workow is to call vari-
ants to identify SNPs between our two samples and the
reference genome. We'll look at the VCF le format
and gure out how to lter SNPs for read coverage and
quality. By counting the number of SNPs between each

item.aspx?e=597 We are pleased to announce a
new course focusing on Evolutionary Biology and
Ecology of Cancer. Knowledge of evolution and ecology
is important to understand and clinically control cancer.
Unfortunately, there are few cancer biologists trained in
evolution and ecology, and few evolutionary biologists
and ecologists work in cancer research.
The aim of this new course is to cross-train evolutionary
biologists and ecologists in cancer, and to train cancer bi-
ologists in the relevant evolutionary biology and ecology
to facilitate cross fertilization of ideas and forge active
collaborations. For example, in the areas of evolution-
ary modelling and 'steering' in vitro, in determinants of
convergent evolution, and in predictive parameters for
evolutionary progression.
Course topics -The dynamics of somatic evolution -
Cancer phylogenetics -Ecological theory -Cooperation
and cheating between neoplastic cells -Ecology of cell-
type interactions -Ecological interactions with the micro-
biome -Ecology of inammation in tumours -Ecological
measurements -Acquired therapeutic resistance and
adaptive therapy
This course is aimed at researchers currently working
in cancer and/or evolution and ecology. It is partic-
ularly suited to evolutionary biologists and ecologists
interested in moving into cancer research, and to can-
cer biologists and oncologists who lack formal train-
ing in evolutionary biology. Applications are invited130 EvolDir April 1, 2016

The sixth DNA metabarcoding Spring School at Kun-
ming
FROM AUGUST 22TH TO 26TH, 2016
DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method for as-
sessing biodiversity from environmental DNA and bulk
samples. It has a wide range of applications: biodiversity
monitoring, animal diet assessment, reconstruction of
paleo communities, among others. DNA metabarcoding
uses molecular techniques such as PCR and next gener-
ation sequencing, and integrates skills in bioinformatics
and biostatistics with classical ecological knowledge.
The DNA metabarcoding spring school is now in its
sixth edition, and this year it is co-organized by the
metabarcoding.org team and the Kunming Institute of
Zoology, with support from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Yunnan.
The DNA metabarcoding spring school will be held from
August 22 to 26, 2016
The school will be divided in two parts:
- Two days of lectures (22nd, 23rd) - Three days of
practicalsApril 1, 2016 EvolDir 131
All the lectures and the practicals will be taught in
English
The number of participants in the lecture portion is not
limited, but registration is mandatory.
The number of participants in the practical portion is
limited to 24.
Candidates can apply for the school by sending an email
to the following address :
kunming2016@metabarcoding.org
The email must contain a brief curriculum vitae and
a short letter of motivation. For applicants wishing to
participate in the practical sessions, we request a more
complete letter indicating how your research will benet
from DNA metabarcoding and what you are hoping
to learn from this school. As part of the course, each
participant in the practical portion will give a ash talk
(5 minutes) about your research and how it is related
to DNA metabarcoding.
Registration deadline is 15 May 2016

Course Schedule
The lectures will cover dierent aspects of DNA metabar-
coding. The bioinformatics practicals will introduce
data analysis from raw sequences to basic ecological con-
clusions. The molecular ecology practical will present
basic techniques for DNA extraction in the eld and
DNA amplication by PCR. After the course formally
ends on 26 August, many of the lecturers will remain
in Kunming to allow for one-on-one interaction and
consultation.

***2 ^nd Active LENS Workshop: June 2016*
The 2 ^nd annual Avida-ED Active LENS Workshop will
be held at Michigan State UniversityJune 9-11, 2016 inEast Lansing, MI.The purpose of this workshop is to
train instructors in the use of the Avida-ED software
package, developed to help students learn about evolu-
tion and the nature of science, so that workshop partici-
pants can both implement classroom interventions using
this software and also train other educators./Teams
of two/ will learn to use Avida-ED and how to best
incorporate it into courses that they teach.Travel and
expenses related to the workshop will be covered for
the 20 workshop participants as part of an NSF-funded
IUSE grant.
Avida is a digital evolution software platform used to
study evolutionary processes, and harness evolution to
solve engineering problems.Avida-ED is a free, user-
friendly version of Avida developed specically for edu-
cational purposes, with a graphical user interface and
visualizations that allow the user to observe evolution in
action. (See http://avida-ed.msu.edu/ for more informa-
tion and to download a copy of the software.)Organisms
within this software (Avidians) are self-replicating com-
puter programs, competing for computational resources
supplied by the environment.Their replication is imper-
fect, resulting in mutations in some of their ospring,
which may alter the ability of those organisms to make
use of their environmental resources.Populations studied
over the course of generations therefore display all of the
elements necessary for evolution by natural selection:
variation, inheritance, selection, and time.Avida-ED
thus provides not a simulation of evolution, but an
actual instance of it.
Avida-ED has been developed for undergraduates and
advanced placement high school students to learn about
the nature of science and evolution in particular.Users
have signicant control of the environment, and are able
to change parameters such as the world size, the muta-
tion rate, and what resources are available.Individual
organisms can be saved in a virtual freezer, analyzed
individually to watch how they perform tasks and repli-
cate themselves, and used to start new evolutionary
runs.Because digital organisms grow and divide much
faster than even the fastest microbes, Avida-ED allows
users to test evolutionary hypotheses over the course of
hours or minutes.By generating hypotheses, collecting
data, and analyzing results, users gain experience not
just with concepts in evolution, but with the nature and
practice of science as a whole.
Workshop participants will join a growing community
of educators using digital evolution to let their stu-
dents directly observe evolutionary processes through
inquiry-based exercises that advance reform-oriented
active learning. Participants will develop new lesson
plans and will help collect assessment data from their
classroom implementations. They will help disseminate134 EvolDir April 1, 2016
materials and train other science educators; nancial
support is available for this. At least one member of
each pair will attend a 1-day follow up meeting at MSU
in early summer 2017 to report on their experience.
The team application form for the Active LENS Work-
shop must be completed online on the following page:
http://avida-ed.beacon-center.org/. *We have extended
the application deadline; applications will be considered
on a rolling basis through March 31, 2016*. If you have

by the Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul,
Republic of Korea during August 14-19, 2016.
The 'Phylogenetic Inference' module oers a theoretical
background and hands-on experience in phylogenetic
analysis for those who have little or no prior expertise in
sequence analysis. An 'Evolutionary Hypothesis Testing'is targeting participants who are well familiar with align-
ments and phylogenetic trees, and would like to extend
their expertise to likelihood and Bayesian inference in
phylogenetics, coalescent and phylogeographic analyses
('phylodynamics'). A 'Large Dataset Analysis' module
will cover the more complex analysis of full genomes,
huge datasets of pathogens including Next Generation
Sequencing data, and combined analyses of pathogen
and host.
Practical sessions in these modules will involve software
such as, PHYLIP, PAUP*, DAMBE, PHYML, MEGA,
PAML, HYPHY, IQ-TREE, TREE-PUZZLE, Consel,
RAxML, Fasttree, SplitsTree, BEAST1, BEAST2, Mr-
Bayes, Clusterpicker, PhyloPart, Phylotype, LASSO,
bowtie, bcftools, PLINK, QuRe, Velvet, SPAdes,
MEGAN, UGENE, Simplot, RDP3, Figtree, R package.
We recommend participants to buy The Phylogenetic
Handbook as a guide during the workshop, and to bring
their own data set.
The abstract and application deadline is extended to
March 15th Selections will be made by the beginning of
April.
The registration fee of 900 Euro covers attendance,

Anatomy & Function of Marine Vertebrates
Join us in Maine for a 2-week credit course in
Anatomy & Function of Marine Vertebrates
(BioSM 3210/MEFB 754) this summer! http://-
www.shoalsmarinelaboratory.org/course/anatomy-and-
function-marine-vertebrates COURSE DESCRIP-
TION:
The course covers comparative anatomy and function of
vertebrates, with a strong emphasis on marine species
(e.g., sharks, bony shes, marine birds, sea turtles, seals,
and cetaceans). We combine studies of structure, evolu-
tion, physiology, and biomechanics to provide an inte-
grative framework for understanding how animals use
anatomy to interface with the marine environment. Lab-
oratory and eld activities include dissections of sharks
and other shes, marine mammal necropsies, trawling,
whale watching, trips to the intertidal, and visits to
nearby seal and seabird colonies. Each student will com-
plete an independent research project on a topic within
the eld of anatomy and function. DATES: July 25 -
August 8, 2016
CREDITS: 4 undergraduate credits from the Univ. of
New Hampshire awarded upon completion
FACULTY: Dr. Stacy C. Farina (Postdoctoral Fellow,
Harvard University) and Dr. Malcolm Gordon (Profes-
sor, UCLA)
PREREQUISITE: One semester of college-level biology
or equivalent.
LOCATION: Shoals Marine Laboratory, Appledore Is-
land, Isles of Shoals, Maine

TGAC Norwich UK RADseq and
Stacks May23-27
Hi All,
We will be hosting a RAD sequencing and analysis
course in June at TGAC in the UK.
http://www.tgac.ac.uk/361 Division/training-
programme/courses-workshops/tgac-events/genotyping-
by-sequencing-2016/ This course will discuss the RAD
molecular protocol and the computational analysis
of RAD data. We will start from the beginning in
presenting analysis techniques, providing participants
with a solid base of UNIX before we move on to
analyzing data with Stacks.
- We will analyze data with and without a reference
genome, focusing on analyzing data to look for popula-
tion structure in the de novo case, and doing Fst genome
scans in the reference genome case. We will also analyze
RAD data to produce phylogenetic trees.
- We will have two guest speakers who will present their
RAD analyses, including population structure in right
whales and the eects of toxins on populations of brown
trout.
- Students will have an opportunity to interact with the
instructors, guest speakers, and fellow attendees giving
lots of time to talk strategy and research tactics.
The course will run from May 23 through the 27th at
The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) in Norwich, UK.
Please forward this message on to any local mailing lists
if you think there may be interest.
Thanks and best wishes,

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although140 EvolDir April 1, 2016
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
