CityU NewYork BiolTheory
Apr12-14CUNY Graduate Center CFP: Philosophy & Theory in
Biology Young Investigators Symposium Theorists have
long probed, and often crossed, the boundaries between
biology and philosophy through conceptual reection,
mathematical modeling, and the analysis of complex
empirical patterns.
>From Aristotle to Darwin and beyond the growth
of biological theory has gone hand-in-hand with philo-
sophical inquiry into biological phenomena. The work
done at these frontiers by theoretically-minded biolo-
gists and scientically-informed philosophers is of mu-
tual benet to both disciplines.
These frontiers are often most evident in the next gen-
eration of researchers who are open to new possibilities
and aware of novel perspectives or innovative tools. We
therefore invite the emerging next generation of the-
orists to catalyze this dialogue with a symposium in
New York City, one of the nations thriving centers of
research in both biology and philosophy of biology, to
be held on April 12-14, 2013 at Lehman College, part
of the City University of New York.
Attendance is open to all, but we accept papers by
young investigators in theoretical biology or philos-
ophy of biology, dened as graduate students, post-
docs, or non-tenured faculty. Papers should be of
a maximum length of *5,000 words* (including ref-
erences) and need to be submitted at the latest by
*November 25, 2012*. Information, registration and
instructions to submit papers can be found at https:/-

Scholars consider a comment in Charles Darwin's Note-
book C to be one of his rst insights into human nature.
As Darwin noted, our mental machinery makes us dif-
ferent. For instance, it allows us to ask about ourselves,
about what a human is. It allows us to question what
we are and the meaning of the way we are. One thing we
have discovered is that humans possess certain unique
mental traits. Ethic and aesthetic values are among
them, and they constitute an essential part of what we
call the human condition. This Colloquium brings to-
gether leading scientists who have worked on several
aspects of human morals and aesthetics considered as
mental traits, their evolution, and their relationship to
related behaviors in other primates.

10th International Meeting on Microbial Epidemiologi-
cal Markers, October 2-5, 2013
The ability of microbes - bacteria, viruses, fungi and
parasites - to mutate rapidly, disseminate and adapt to
new hosts and environments, forces us to increase our
capabilities for the early recognition of novel strains
of pathogens, and to understand the factors that con-
tribute to their diversity, evolution and dissemination.
IMMEM-10 will address a variety of topics related to
pathogen emergence, population-level diversity, evolu-
tion of virulence and antibiotic resistance, strain track-
ing, typing networks, public health and surveillance,
novel typing approaches, high-throughput sequencing,
genomics, and molecular epidemiology of infectious dis-
eases. The meeting will take place at Institut Pasteur,
in the heart of Paris.

Portugal OligochaeteTaxonomy
Apr22-25
6th IOTM
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
For its 6th edition, the IOTM goes to *Palmeira de
Faro* in the north of Portugal! Located at 4 km from
Esposende, in the parish of Palmeira de Faro, Quinta
da Seara is a privileged space of interaction with the re-
gion. On one side, the sea and the magnicent beaches
of Esposende. On the other, the rural landscape in-
dented by river Cavado, rich in stories and traditions.
Oligochaeta (few-bristled worms) is an extremely im-
portant taxonomic group in aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystems. In spite of the importance of oligochaetes,
there are presently some serious deciencies in the
knowledge about their taxonomy, distribution, biol-
ogy and ecology, in comparison with mammals, birds,
lizards and other organismal groups. One way to bridge
this gap is to bring together scientists working on the
subject with the aim to speed up information about the
progress in their work, exchange ideas and encourage
them to cooperate. This is the basic idea behind the or-ganization of the International Oligochaeta Taxonomy
Meetings (IOTM). So far, ve successful meetings took
place. Traditionally, the meetings concentrate mainly
on Oligochaete taxonomy and phylogeny, but also dis-
cuss dierent aspects from other scientic elds, e.g.
earthworm ecology, faunistics and phylogeography as
well as new methods of their study. The 6th Interna-
tional Oligochaete Taxonomy Meeting will continue in
the best tradition of the previous four meetings and will
take place in Palmeira de Faro in Portugal, from April
22th to April 25th, 2013. An optional eld excursion
will be organised on April 26th.
We are quite convinced that you will like the venue of
the Quinta da Seara in Palmeira de Faro, in the North
of Portugal. It is located in a wonderful region, calm
and beautiful.
On our web site <http://6thiotm.tomas-pavlicek-
biologie.net/ >, you will nd a lot of information con-
cerning the conference and its venue. And of course,
you can already register !
Promote the conference among your colleagues and if
you have some addresses that we could add to our mail-
ing list, please let us know.

tasis and resistance to therapies. The Jacques Monod
Conference \*Ecological and Evolutionary Perspectives
in Cancer" *aims to promote this emerging discipline by
addressing some of the most important questions about
cancerogenesis. The conference will cover 3 themes:
- Interspecic patterns and processes - Progression -
Therapies
The rst theme will address the observation that in-
fectious agents can cause cancers. Persistent infections
may promote cancer because long-term host defensive
responses induce inammation that subsequently in-
creases mutation rates. Why human defensive mech-
anisms have not evolved to more eciently control
or eliminate invasive cell lineages, and why do some
species with more somatic tissue show less than ex-
pected incidences of cancer? The second theme will
evaluate the role of the tumor environment and natu-
ral selection in explaining cancer progression. To what
extent are dierent cancers predictable and what are
the key contributing variables? The third theme will
tackle the daunting challenge of employing evolution-
ary theories to improve cancer therapies. It will seek
how preventative, curative and management therapies
can be improved and even optimized to slow or stop the
emergence of resistance to chemotherapies.

May25-26
Dear Colleagues, The third annual Yosemite Symbio-
sis Institute will take place on May 25-26, 2013 at the
Sierra Nevada Research Institute, Yosemite National
Park.
This is an integrative meeting of biologists focusing
on symbiosis research Co-organized by M onica Medina
(UC Merced) and Joel Sachs (UC Riverside)
May 25-26, 2013. DEADLINES: EARLY BIRD REG-
ISTRATION: JANUARY 15TH POSTER/TALK
SUBMISSIONS: MARCH 15TH KEYNOTE
SPEAKER: John N. Thompson Title: \Relent-
less Coevolutionary Dynamics" Abstract: We now
know that coevolution is not a slow and stately process.
It is often fast and relentless at every temporal and
spatial scale. We have evidence of rapid coevolutionary
change in environments ranging from relatively simple
microcosms to complex communities in nature. The
process generates ever-shifting mosaics of adaptation
and counter-adaptation across ecosytems. Most
coevolutionary changes do not lead to sustained
directional change in species, but they are ecologically
important and evolutionarily crucial as the means by
which populations persist. It is likely that we are still
underestimating the rates and importance of ongoing
coevolution among interacting species.
Key information for our 3rd annual meeting:
Why: We again had a very successful event last year!
This inspired us to keep the momentum going. Our
goal is continue these meetings every year at Yosemite
to better integrate scientists that focus on symbiosis re-
search. The last couple of years, the event was funded
by the University of California (Oce of the President
and UC Merced Oce of Research) enabling us to bring
people from all over the state and the Western US. We
would like to attract participants from the rest of the
country for what promises to become an important re-
gional meeting for our discipline. This year we are still
trying to keep costs down, so please be prepared to
share quaint but rustic facilities at a eld station.
Who: We plan this meeting to be small by design
(<50) and seek to gather scientists interested in cooper-
ation and symbiosis. Last year the workshop covered a
range of symbiosis topics from ecology and evolution to14 EvolDir December 1, 2012
molecular mechanisms. We have made reservations for
approximately 45 attendees (though more options are
available for anyone who would like to stay nearby). We
would like to make room for a diverse group of people so
we will initially accept up to 3 lab members per group
(including the PI) on a rst come rst served basis.
When: The meeting will be held May 25th-26th, though
we hope that attendees will arrive on Friday to enjoy
the park. We will schedule talks for part of each day
so that there is plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful
Yosemite Valley and environs. Since time at the con-
ference is limited, we will ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). We will
hope to give everyone their rst preference, but some of
the attendees might be asked to submit posters if there
is a limitation in talk slots. Abstract and early bird
registration are due on February 1st.
Where: The talks and all meals will take place at
the community center in Wawona, California which
just within the South Entrance of Yosemite National
Park and part of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute
(SNRI). SNRI has a set of cabins throughout Wawona
and all within a short walk of the community center.Costs: Grad students $180, Postdocs $200, PIs $220
by January 15. grad students $220, postdocs $240, PIs
$260 after January 15. This fee will cover both lodging
and food. Last year the food was excellent so we hope
to maintain a high level of quality this year too!

Dear Colleagues,
Brown University and the Marine Biological Labs in
Woods Hole are accepting applications for the Ph.D.
program in Reverse Ecology, the application of next-
generation sequencing technologies to questions in ecol-
ogy, evolution and environmental sciences.
This program is supported by an NSF IGERT award
and will give special consideration to applicants inter-
ested in integrating genomics, ecology and evolutionary
biology, and computational biology as the foundation of
their doctoral training. Highlights of the program are a
core course in reverse ecology that applies high through-
put sequencing tools, neutral models of ecological and
evolutionary variation, and computational analyses of
large data sets to test specic ecological or evolutionary
questions at NSF LTER sites. Training in eld ecol-
ogy, Illumina library preparation, and computational
and statistical analyses are achieved through hands-
on, group projects that culminate in joint- authored
manuscripts for publication.

CityUNewYork Conservation
A position for a PhD student at the Graduate Cen-
ter, City University of New York is available through
the Conservation Biology laboratory of Dr. Eugenia
Naro-Maciel, College of Staten Island, starting Fall
2013. The position includes full tuition, benets, and
a full salary stipend.Compatible candidates should be
interested in one of two areas: 1) investigating ge-
netic relationships among and within species in or-
der to understand patterns and processes of molecu-
lar evolution, and to inform conservation strategies; 2)
restoration ecology. There are several current research
projects ranging from ecological and genetic research at
Freshkills Park, formerly one of the world's largest land-
lls, to conservation genetics or genomics (please see be-
low). Students are also welcome to develop their own
original projects related to the Freshkills Park ecosys-
tem, or to develop new ideas in conservation genet-
ics, genomics, or bioinformatics. To ll this position
the student must be accepted to the CUNY GraduateCenter (http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Prospective-Current-
Students/Prospective-Students). The application is
due in December. Interested students are re-
quested to email a cv and cover letter, including re-
search interests, GRE scores, and grades to Euge-
nia.NaroMaciel@csi.cuny.edu
POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE Protected
areas form the cornerstone for conservation planning
worldwide; however, protecting an area does not au-
tomatically achieve conservation outcomes. Sea tur-
tles and other highly migratory organisms protected in
one area may face threats when moving to other locali-
ties. Understanding the linkages between groups in pro-
tected areas and outside them is key to eective conser-
vation. We are therefore investigating the population
distribution of highly migratory sea turtles through-
out the world's oceans (Naro-Maciel and Fomia 2006;
Naro-Maciel et al. 2007; Caraccio et al. 2008; Monzon-
Arguello et al. 2010). Identifying migratory connec-
tions is particularly challenging in the case of highly
migratory organisms such as sea turtles, which spend
much of their lives hidden from view moving through-
out the oceans. We are using genetic analysis to under-
stand the connections between sea turtle populations.
By determining the unknown linkages between feeding
grounds and other regional breeding or feeding sites,
we will better understand the range of these turtles,
identify regional management partners, and determine
conservation priorities.
DNA BARCODING DNA barcoding is a global
initiative that provides a standardized and e-
cient tool to catalogue and inventory biodiversity,
with signicant conservation applications (http://-
www.barcoding.si.edu/whatis.html). To obtain DNA
barcodes of marine turtles, we sequenced a segment of
the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from
eighty turtles of all seven species in the Atlantic and Pa-
cic Ocean basins. To further investigate genetic varia-
tion, we sequenced green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from
nine additional Atlantic/Mediterranean nesting areas
and from the Eastern Pacic. We established character-
based DNA barcodes for each species using unique com-
binations of character states. DNA barcoding of marine
turtles is a powerful tool for species identication and
wildlife forensics, which also provides complementary
data for conservation genetic research (Naro-Maciel et
al. 2010). The project has been expanded to include
DNA barcodes for other threatened turtles listed on
the IUCN Red List of threatened species (Reid et al.
2011), and spiny lobsters (Naro-Maciel et al. 2011).
Future eorts will focus on urban barcoding including
at Freshkills Park.
EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS Marine cheloni-December 1, 2012 EvolDir 17
ans have inhabited the earth for over 100 million years
(Hirayama, 1998). To address the lingering controver-
sies and to recover a denitive marine turtle phylogeny,
we sequenced ve nuclear DNA markers and two mi-
tochondrial genes in the seven widely recognized ma-
rine turtle species, the taxonomically ambiguous East-
ern Pacic green turtle, and four outgroups. Using this
approach we tested hypotheses about the evolutionary
relationships of marine turtles, including the placement
of the geographically restricted atback turtle, and the
origin of the rare spongivorous dietary habit of hawks-
bill turtles. Our phylogenetic results dier from those
recovered in previous molecular studies by strongly sup-
porting a sister-taxon relationship between the atback
(Natator depressus) and green turtles (Chelonia my-
das). This phylogenetic study provides a foundation
for more detailed research in evolutionary biology, clari-
es systematic issues of these highly threatened species,
and signicantly contributes to the resolution of the
\turtle tree of life" (Naro-Maciel et al. 2008). Our
next project focuses on the

PhD Scholarship in Population genetics A PhD Scholar-
ship in Population Genetics is available at the National
Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua) with start-
ing date 1st February or 1st March 2013.
The project will primarily be carried out in the Sec-
tion for Marine Living Resources' Population Genetics
group in Silkeborg, Denmark. The PhD project is a
part of a European Union joint research project assess-
ing genetic eects of aquaculture on wild sh popula-
tions. The project is coordinated by DTU Aqua and
started November 2012. The PhD project will have
an independent prole but will be carried out in col-
laboration with international research partners. The
successful applicant will be expected to take part in
experimental work during regular shorter stays in Nor-
way.
The purpose of DTU Aqua is to provide research, ad-
vice and education at the highest international level
within the sustainable exploitation of living marine and
freshwater resources, the biology of aquatic organisms
and the development of ecosystems as well as their inte-
gration in ecosystem-based management. The institute
has an international research sta comprising approx.
120 academic employees.
Project description Knowledge of local adaptation and
adaptive potential of natural populations is becoming
increasingly relevant due to anthropogenic changes to
the environment. Humans have cultured and released
sh into wild populations for hundreds of years. How-
ever, it was not until the development of the aqua-
culture industry, together with increase in numbers
of escapees observed in wild populations, that ge-
netic interactions between domesticated and wild con-
specics started to become a major global concern.
The project addresses local adaptation in brown trout,
Salmo trutta, and will investigate how interbreeding
between individuals of wild and hatchery origin aects
life history and tness in wild populations. The project
will combine information from novel genetic markers
with experimental assessment of heritable tness com-
ponents and dierences in life-history traits. Link-
age mapping and admixture mapping will be appliedDecember 1, 2012 EvolDir 19
to link quantitative traits with specic gene regions
and for establishing the genetic architecture of intro-
gression. The project will take advantage of the fact
that interbreeding between wild and farmed sh pro-
vides a unique opportunity to study functional adapta-
tions from a general evolutionary perspective, and the
project is planned to have a strong evolutionary ecol-
ogy prole. The results of the project will form the
basis for providing advice on management of farmed
and wild trout populations to national authorities and
the European Commission.
Qualications We are looking for a candidate who has:
Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree, or equivalent. Pre-
vious experience in population or breeding genetics and
preferentially also ecological research. Good math-
ematical skills, and potentially experience with QTL
modeling. Prociency in written and spoken English.
Keen interest in research and for working within the
eld of molecular and evolutionary ecology.

DrexelU EvolutionOfSymbiosis
Subject Header: Graduate Position: DrexelUniver-
sity.EvolutionOfSymbiosis
The Russell lab at Drexel University seeks driven and
enthusiastic Ph.D candidates to join them in the De-
partment of Biology for the Fall of 2013. The best
applicants will have background experience in molec-
ular ecology, microbiology, microscopy, or entomology.
Students would work on one of two NSF-funded grants
focused on symbiosis in aphids and ants.
The central theme in the Russell lab is the evolution
of symbiosis, and we are addressing dierent types of
questions in the aphid and ant systems.
First, what features correlate with the composition of
symbiotic communities across the ants? And what
do such correlations tell us about the likely causes
and consequences of symbiosis in this group? We are
specically interested in the question of whether mi-
crobes have facilitated the origins of herbivory across
the ants, and are using experimental and metagenomic
approaches to address this possibility.
Second, what forces favor the maintenance of diverse,
heritable symbiont communities in the pea aphid?
There are at least seven species of \secondary" sym-
bionts infecting aphids from this species. Five of these
are known to defend against natural enemies, and all
are found at intermediate levels within pea aphid pop-
ulations. But it has recently been shown that several
of these species exhibit strain diversity, with up to four
dierent strains of one symbiont existing within a sin-
gle population. Given the existence of multiple sym-
biont infections, the number of cytoplasmic genotypes
harbored by pea aphids is quite large. How can such20 EvolDir December 1, 2012
diversity be maintained in aphid populations? And do
defensive symbionts mediate antagonistic coevolution
between aphids and their natural enemies?
The lab is currently made up of three graduate stu-
dents and one postdoc. All students have advanced to
Ph.D candidacy and will serve as experienced mentors
for incoming students. Students will be trained in the
realms of molecular biology, bioinformatics (and possi-
bly metagenomics), experimental biology, and eld re-
search. Current eld sites include Southeastern Penn-
sylvania and the Florida Keys. Through Jake Rus-
sell's joint appointment with Drexel's new Biodiversity,
Earth, and Environmental Sciences, students will in-
teract with a broad range of faculty with interests in
organismal biology, systematics, ecology, and evolution.

FunctionalGenomicsMetabolomics
Graduate Student Positions: Functional Genomics and
Metabolomics
Merritt Lab, Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry,
Laurentian University
Graduate positions to study a variety of systems linked
by common questions investigating the connection be-
tween genotype and phenotype are available in the Mer-
ritt Lab (http://www3.laurentian.ca/merritt). Both
MSc and PhD positions are available to start May-September 2013.
Current areas of investigation focus on network func-
tion, metabolomic complexity, and gene expression in
ies and microbes. Successful applicants will be ex-
pected to develop research projects of their own that
complement and build on these areas.
Network metabolomics
Much of my research program investigates interactions
across simple metabolic networks as models of biolog-
ical complexity. Often using Drosophila melanogaster,
this research combines naturally occurring and labo-
ratory engineered genetic variation with biochemical,
physiological, and complex biological phenotypes to
quantify the connection between genetic variation and
biological complexity. Working with D. melanogaster
allows us to combine cutting edge molecular genetics
with natural population genetic diversity to investigate
the function and evolution of network complexity. This
work is expanding our understanding of interactions
within networks and the importance of the overall ge-
netic background. Our results have implications both
in the application of model systems and in the impor-
tance of inter-individual genetic variation. Current di-
rections in this research include expanding the search
for network metabolites using broad-based liquid chro-
matography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS).
Microbial Diversity and Metabolomic Complexity
My lab is also using LC/MS for metabolomic proling
to quantify interactions within microbial communities.
This research will use naturally occurring and lab cul-
tured communities with increasing species richness to
quantify interactions within these communities with a
focus on the distinct microbial communities of Acid
Mine Drainage (AMD) environments. AMD, highly
acidic water draining from mine waste, is a global en-
vironmental issue that largely results from microbial
metabolism of mining contaminates. As such, the mi-
crobial communities are of great environmental and
economic interest. These communities are also strik-
ingly simple, facilitating their study and reconstruc-
tion, making them an exciting system for understand-
ing the fundamental science of community interactions
and metabolomics. This research combines the pub-
licly available genomic and metagenomic libraries for
many of the dominant AMD microbes with developing
LC/MS-based metabolomic proling to establish the
connections between species and genome diversity and
metabolic complexity. This work will be co-supervised
with Drs. Nadia Mykytczuk and Leo Leduc in the De-
partment of Biology at Laurentian University.
Inuence of Genomic Architecture and Diversity on22 EvolDir December 1, 2012
Gene Expression
Conventional models of gene regulation focus on cis-
regulation, the control of transcription by regulatory
elements on the chromosome being transcribed. Re-
cent research has highlighted the importance of trans-
regulation, the inuence of one chromosome on the ex-
pression of the other, essentially crosstalk between chro-
mosomes and a form of epigenetic regulation. Trans-
regulation is much more poorly understood than cis-
, but is a fast developing eld with implications in
both \normal" and disease state gene expression; trans-
regulation appears to be the norm in ies, but has been
implicated in disregulation of gene expression in some
human cancers. My lab has been developing a model
system in D. melanogaster that is extremely sensitive
and experimentally tractable. Current research is in-
vestigating the role of both local and global factors in
driving these trans-interactions.
The Merritt Lab is funded by grants from the Cana-
dian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Natural
Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC),
including a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair. Laurentian
University is a bilingual institution oering courses in
both French and English.
Applicants should be independently motivated, have a
good academic record, and have demonstrated both an
interest in and aptitude for research. Please send an

Ph.D. Students Wanted in Biodiversity Science
I will be starting up my lab at Louisiana State Univer-

students. Most of my research focuses on diversica-
tion processes in SE Asian and African small mammals.
In general, I am interested in questions related to the
geography and ecology of speciation and communityassembly, systematics and species delimitation, and ge-
ographic patterns of biodiversity, especially in islands
and island-like systems. I use molecular genetics, eld
research, morphology, and bioinformatic techniques to
address questions in these areas. Students with expe-
rience in DNA sequencing, phylogenetics, biodiversity
inventories, or bioinformatics will be ideally suited, but
enthusiasm for research is also important. Students will
be encouraged to develop their own research interests
and projects, but numerous collaborative opportunities
are available for existing projects.
Financial support will be available in the form of Cura-
torial Assistantships from the Museum of Natural Sci-

Project description: What maintains variation in natu-December 1, 2012 EvolDir 23
ral populations? This seemingly simple question repre-
sents one of the major unsolved problems in evolution-
ary biology. Selection in natural populations is often
strong, and most traits are heritable, which in the long
run should lead to depletion of standing genetic vari-
ation. Yet this is not what we see. Although several
mechanisms for the maintenance of genetic variation
have been suggested, such as mutation-selection bal-
ance and uctuating selection, this issue is far from
resolved. Recently, a new appreciation of the poten-
tial role of sexual antagonism in shaping patterns of
standing genetic variation has developed. Sexual antag-
onism occurs when the same allele has opposite tness
eects in males and females, and as such may constrain
the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sexual antago-
nism has often been considered a relatively transient
phenomenon which will eventually be resolved by the
evolution of sex-specic modiers, but recent research
suggests that sexual antagonism can in fact be a chronic
phenomenon, and may therefore be an important com-
ponent of the standing genetic variation in sexual or-
ganisms.
Although there are theoretical reasons why such phe-
nomena could be important even in hermaphrodites,
there is currently little empirical data.However
mutation-selection balance, spatial and temporal vari-
ation in sex-specic tness optima, assortative mating
for tness, negative frequency-dependence, and asym-
metric tness and dominance eects are all phenomena
that could contribute to maintaining sexually antago-
nistic genetic variation within hermaphroditic popula-
tions.The student will further explore this area using
a three-pronged approach which combines quantitative
genetics, experimental evolution, and simulation mod-
eling.The amount of standing sexually antagonistic ge-
netic variation for tness in the hermaphroditic at-
worm /M. lignano/ can be measured using a standard
quantitative genetics breeding design.An experimental
protocol has already been developed and is currently
in the pilot stage, which will allow the creation of a
synthetic sex chromosome to measure the response to
sex-limited experimental evolution in /M. lignano. /Fi-
nally, the student will use simulation modeling to de-
termine under which conditions each of the phenomena
listed above may contribute to intralocus sexual conict
in hermaphrodites.

The projects will use New Zealand's fantastic fossil
record of marine snails and their living descendents.
By combining DNA evidence from extant species with
shell analysis of their fossil relatives, the putative link
between speciation and punctuated evolution will be
examined. The two projects will use the following tools,
division dependent on the skills and interests of the can-
didates: (1) Model-based tests of evolutionary mode of
shell shape change using outline-based Fourier shape
analysis and/or landmark-based geometric morphome-

phometrics, population genetics and coalesence theory.
(3) Molecular clock analysis to estimate time of clado-
genesis and test for concordance with fossil record orig-
ination dates.

Evolution of social behaviors
Project abstract Natural selection is expected to lead to
'good' genes taking over a population, and thereby to
deplete genetic variation in natural populations. Nev-
ertheless, even traits closely correlated to tness often
show considerable genotypic and phenotypic variation.
Social behavior like dominance behavior and parental
care behavior can vary widely between individuals, and
incur tness consequences. There must therefore be
mechanisms operating that result in genetic variation
in social behavioral traits being preserved. Dierent so-
cial environments may select for dierent social traits.
A PhD position is available to examine this hypothe-
sis and the evolutionary consequences. We will analyze
12 years of data from a pedigreed, wild island popu-
lation of house sparrows. We use focused experiments
on captive sparrows in Germany to test our hypothe-
ses generated from observations on the wild population.

Project abstract Our main research focuses on the
proximate underpinning and ecological and evolution-
ary repercussions of between-individual in behavior and
other labile traits. We apply research paradigms that
focus on the integration of behavioral ecology, quantita-
tive genetics, and evolutionary biology. We study suites
of key behavioral (exploratory tendency, anti-predator
boldness, aggressiveness) and life-history traits in each
of 12 nest box populations of great tits, and use ex-perimental approaches to ask i) whether natural se-
lection can help maintain individual variation and ii)
whether variation itself has ecological and evolution-
ary repercussions. This year, we encourage applicants
with interest in the evolutionary ecology of dispersal
to apply, since we are planning to quantify experimen-

variation in natal dispersal behavior, and its links with
perceived predation risk and parental personality (col-

but remarkably little is known about the acquisitionDecember 1, 2012 EvolDir 27
of their distinctive anatomical traits. The early fossil
record of chondrichthyans is comprised mainly of iso-
lated scales, teeth, and spines, while articulated skele-
tons are comparatively rare. The current project exam-
ines the morphology and phylogenetic relationships of
three articulated chondrichthyan and chondrichthyan-
like fossil shes from the Devonian and Carboniferous
periods. The candidate will address several key ques-
tions regarding the characters of early chondrichthyans,
how chondrichthyans are identied in the fossil record,
and the implications for the timing and morphological
evolution of both chondrichthyans and early jawed ver-
tebrate fossils.
This project will provide training in phylogenetic tech-
niques, as well as comparative morphological expertise,
microscopic and histologic techniques, as well as poten-
tial for learning computed tomography techniques and
possible eldwork. Applications from candidates who
submit their own project ideas in a related area are
encouraged and will be considered.
General requirements and skills The successful candi-
date should have a Master's or Honour's bachelorate
(or equivalent) degree in biology, geology, or palaeontol-
ogy with experience in systematics/phylogenetics and

PHD POSITION: \DOMESTICATION AND THE
EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR"
The position is available in Animal behaviour at the
Department of Zoology, StockholmUniversity. Appli-
cation Deadline: 20 November 2012.
**
Project description: Domestication of animals involves
behavioural changes such as increased tolerance and
less aggressiveness. Such changes will inuence an an-
imal's social relationships. By studying domesticated
animals and their wild ancestors, we can increase our
knowledge of the evolution of social behaviour. Studies
of wolves and feral dogs show dierences in both the
intensity of territorial defense and the degree of aggres-
siveness within a pack, but the knowledge of how so-
cial behaviour and aggression develop during ontogeny
is small. This project aims to increase our knowledge
of the eects of domestication by studying two related
species, a non-domesticated species (the wolf) and a
domesticated species (the dog), primarily in relation
to the ontogeny of variables relevant to social life and
especially social dominance. Social behaviours during
ontogeny will be studied during the juvenile period, in-
cluding behavioural tests at dierent ages and physi-
ological parameters. The project can provide impor-
tant insights into how evolutionary changes in social
behaviour can occur.
Qualications: MSc or similar degree in animal be-
haviour or related disciplines, including at least 80
weeks (120 Swedish higher education credits) of biol-
ogy studies, with a degree project in animal behaviour
of at least 20 weeks (30 creditsat advanced level. Ap-
plicants who have acquired corresponding competence
in Swedenor abroad are also qualied. Applicants will
be assessed based on their documented knowledge in
elds relevant to the research area, their creativity, in-
dependence and social competence, the quality of their
degree project thesis and other publications, and the
cover letter. Applicants with documented experience
of behavioral studies will have an advantage in the se-
lection process.

GRADUATE POSITIONS AT UC BERKELEY
PhD positions are available at UC Berkeley over the
next few years as part of a newly funded project
that seeks to merge two disparate areas of research
to understand patterns of biodiversity, (1) a broad
ecological approach which provides insights into
how species assemble and interact in a community;
(2) a lineage based approach which focuses on how
species adapt, diversity, or decline over time. We will
integrate these two approaches by using a system of
age-structured biological communities on the youngest
of the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii), and comparing
these to communities on the next older island of
Maui. Within Hawaii Island, lineages of organisms
are actively diversifying, while the community and
food web contexts in which they are embedded are
changing with the development of their habitats. The
system is relatively simple ecologically, but impor-
tantly it represents an environmental chronosequence,
allowing for a \space-for-time" substitution. The
project (part of NSF's \Dimensions in Biodiversity"
http://www.nsf.gov/news/news summ.jsp?cntn id=-
125495&org=BIO&from=news ) will look at priority,
sequence, and associated interaction strengths among
members of a community as it develops, and hence
how biodiversity is generated, assembled, and lost.
Students interested in any one of the following are en-
couraged to apply: (1) macroecological metrics of di-December 1, 2012 EvolDir 35
versity and abundance of species and how these might
change over time; (2) dynamics of predator-prey or
other interactions between species; (3) evolutionary
adaptation and speciation. Data to be analyzed will in-
clude molecular, morphological, ecological, and/or be-
havioral characters, and will involve macroecological,
macroevolutionary, and population genetic and phylo-
genetic analyses. A single student will focus on one
aspect of the project, though interest in the integra-
tion between ecological and evolutionary approaches is
encouraged.

SymbioticEvolution
Graduate Positions: Evolution of symbioses
The Sachs lab at the University of California in River-
side is looking to recruit multiple Ph.D. students inter-
ested in plant-bacterial symbioses.
Our research seeks to understand the emergence and
spread of exploitative traits in symbiont populations,especially the plant symbiont Bradyrhizobium japon-
icum.
Bradyrhizobia are bacteria that induce benecial infec-
tions in legume plants: the bacteria form nodules on
host roots and x atmospheric nitrogen in exchange
for carbon from their plant hosts. Potential projects
include collecting Bradyrhizobium from wild legume
populations, culturing and sequencing DNA of bacte-
rial isolates and using computational and experimental
methods to test hypotheses about the evolution of sym-
biosis and pathogenesis. Other common techniques in-
clude experimental evolution, microcosm experiments,
greenhouse inoculations and molecular analysis at the
level of genes to genomes. At a broader level our lab
also studies the macroevolution of symbiosis across bac-
teria using computational techniques that gather and
analyze data from published sources.
The University of California at Riverside is home to
a very strong collection of faculty researching ecol-
ogy and evolution. The Department of Biology hosts
an excellent graduate program in Ecology, Evolu-
tion and Organismal Biology (http://eeob.ucr.edu/-
). Moreover, the Sachs Lab welcomes students
from the Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics grad-
uate program (http://ggb.ucr.edu/), the Microbiol-
ogy graduate program (http://microbiology.ucr.edu/-
) and the Botany and Plant Sciences program
(www.plantbiology.ucr.edu/) .
Riverside is a great town with excellent weather, ac-
cess to beaches, mountains and desert and is in close
proximity to Los Angeles, Palm Springs and San Diego.
For more details see our website: www.sachslab.com .
Interested students are encouraged to email Dr. Sachs

UCincinnati EvolutionaryGenetics
The Center for Conservation and Research of Endan-
gered Wildlife (CREW) at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botan-
ical Garden in collaboration with the Department of
Biological Sciences at the University of Cincinnati is
oering a unique opportunity for a qualied, energetic
Ph.D. student with a strong interest in plant conser-
vation and molecular biology.The student will be part
of a project supported by a Federal grant from the In-
stitute of Museum and Library Services involving the
evaluation of samples that have been cryopreserved for
up to 24 years in CREW's CryoBioBank.
The specic focus for the student will be to analyze
the genetic components of this project and work with
others in the team, investigating those results in rela-
tion to the survival of seed and tissue samples.The rst
aspect of this will include genetic analysis of samples
removed from storage in comparison with samples that
have been in active culture over the same amount of
time. Comparison will be made with genetic data from
before the time of banking. The goal will be to deter-
mine whether genetic changes have occurred in the sam-
ples over time, during in vitro culture or cryostorage.
Other DNA analytical methods, such as microsatellites,
will also be employed in other parts of this study. Ge-
netic analysis will also be conducted on a subset of sam-
ples that will be re-banked during the course of this
project.The second aspect will involve the analysis of
300 samples for DNA/RNA degradation.This will in-
volve travel to the National Center for Plant Genetic
Resources labs of the USDA in Ft. Collins, CO, for one
week in each of three years, to learn the use of the Ag-
ilent Bioanalyzer, prepare samples, and run them for
analysis. The Ph.D. student will work under the di-
rection of Dr. Theresa Culley, from the Department of
Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati, in collabo-
ration with Dr. Valerie Pence, the PI of the project, lo-
cated at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.The
University and Zoo are within a mile of each other.
Candidates for this position should have a B.S. or an
M.S., with a strong background in plant genetic anal-
ysis and molecular techniques, as well as in statistical
analysis. A strong interest in plant conservation is also
required. A familiarity with in vitro and/or cryopreser-
vation methods is desirable.
This position provides an annual stipend of $22,000 inaddition to a graduate scholarship which covers most
tuition costs. The position will start no later than
September, 2013, but an earlier start date can be con-
sidered.

MammalianEvolution
Two PhD positions in Mammalian Evolutionary Biol-
ogy and Comparative Genomics funded by the Euro-
pean Research Council
Ageing is the gradual and irreversible breakdown of liv-
ing systems associated with the advancement of time,
which leads to an increase in vulnerability and even-
tual mortality. It is considered as one of the most fa-
miliar but least well-understood processes in biology,
with hundreds of theories developed about why and
how we age. Despite recent advances in ageing research,
the intrinsic complexity of the ageing process has pre-
vented a full understanding of this process, therefore,
ageing remains a grand challenge in contemporary bi-
ology. The new ERC funded research team that Dr.
Teeling is gathering will tackle this challenge by uncov-
ering the molecular mechanisms of halted ageing in a
unique model system, the bats. We will couple state
of the art-eld biology with cutting-edge next gener-
ation comparative genomic and transcriptomic studies
to address this challenge.
Two four-year fully funded PhD positions are currently
available in the Teeling lab:
(1)PhD 1: The successful candidate will explore ageDecember 1, 2012 EvolDir 37
related MtDNA diversity & telomeric variation across
mammals using modern molecular biology techniques.
This project will consist of wet laboratory data genera-
tion, comparative genomic and phylogenetic evolution-
ary analyses. The student will be expected to partic-
ipate in eld sessions to gather the required samples.
Therefore, we require an individual that has successful
experience in generating molecular data using modern
laboratory techniques and is willing to optimise and
develop novel molecular protocols. Preference will be
given for candidates that also have experience in phylo-
genetic and comparative genomic analyses. An under-
standing of mammalian evolutionary history and bat
biology would be desirable. This student must have an
honours B.Sc. in Biology or equivalent and preferably
an M.Sc. or equivalent in Evolutionary Biology. The
position is fully funded for four years, including fees,
student stipend, travel to conferences and workshops.
Start date January 1st 2013.
(2)PhD 2: The successful candidate will explore the
age related population level changes in the trascriptome
gathered from a wild population of bats. Their primary
role will be to collect, extract, sequence and analyse
the transcriptome data from samples that he/she will
acquire through the eld sessions. This project will
consist primarily of wet laboratory data generation, de
novo transcriptome assembly and comparative analy-
ses. Therefore, we require an individual with primarily
bioinformatic experience in assembling and analyzing
next generation sequence data. The individual should
also have experience/understanding of the wet labora-
tory generation of these data and a willingness to de-
velop these skills if necessary. Preference will be given
to candidates that have both the bioinformatic and the
wet laboratory experience in the generation and anal-
yses of next generation transcriptome data. An under-
standing of mammalian evolutionary history and bat
biology would be desirable. This student must have an
honours B.Sc. or equivalent and preferably an M.Sc.or
equivalent. The position is fully funded for four years,
including fees, student stipend, travel to conferences
and workshops. Start date January 1st- June 2013.
Both PhD students will become part of a larger ERC
funded multidisciplinary team.
To apply, please send a full C.V. detailing your experi-
ence and contact details of three referees. Also include

PhD STUDENTSHIP IN DISEASE ECOLOGY Cen-

The dynamics of coinfection: understanding the
immune- and resource-mediated mechanisms that drive
within-host parasite interactions
Supervisors: Dr Amy Pedersen (Institute of Evolution-
ary Biology, University of Edinburgh) Prof. Judi Allen
(Institute of Immunology and Infection Research,
University of Edinburgh) Dr Andy Fenton (Institute
of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool) Inter-
ested individuals must follow the instructions at this
link on how to apply http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-
departments/biology/postgraduate/pgr/how-to-apply
If you would like us to consider you for one of our
scholarships you must apply by 18th January 2013 at
the latest.
Individuals are typically hosts to a variety of parasite
species, representing vast taxonomic diversity, and ex-
ploiting a wide range of host tissues and resources. This
diversity creates a dynamic and complex parasite com-
munity within individuals, which may be structured
by interspecic interactions, either bottom-up' (via re-
source competition) or top-down' (via the host's im-
mune system). Within-host interactions between co-
infecting parasites can be critical to the tness and dy-
namics of both the parasites and the host. A growing
literature emphasises the potential importance of such
interactions to population and community ecology and
various longitudinal eld studies have demonstrated the
ubiquity of co-infection in the wild. However, evidence
of interactions between co-infecting parasites in natu-
ral populations remains equivocal, and the mechanisms
that drive these interactions have been poorly studied.
Therefore many key questions remain unanswered, par-
ticularly relating to the type of mechanisms that shape
within-host parasite communities, which is vital for the
design of eective long-term disease control strategies.38 EvolDir December 1, 2012
The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to investi-
gate the mechanisms determining within-host parasite
interactions, in order to better understand the conse-
quences of coinfection for host health, and importantly,
provide insight into treatment strategies for coinfected
populations. This project will focus on the micropar-
asite (viruses, bacteria, & protozoans) and macropara-
site (nematodes, cestodes) communities of wild wood
mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) populations in the UK,
where coinfection is the norm ( >70%). The aims of
the project are (1) to develop immunological assays for
wood mice in order to measure the immune phenotypes
of wild mice, (2) to test whether resource competi-
tion or immune-mediated interactions structure within-
host parasite communites, using data from experimen-
tal treatment studies in wild mice populations, and (3)
to test the direction and strength of these mechanisms
using controlled laboratory studies. Training will be
provided in relevant immunological and parasitological
techniques and the successful applicant will work with
researchers with a breadth of expertise in ecology, im-
munology, evolutionary biology and host-pathogen in-
teractions.
The successful applicant will have a biological sciences
degree, either a 1st or 2i, and possibly an MSc in ecol-
ogy, immunology, or infectious disease/parasitology.

UEdinburgh EvolutionOfAgeing
PhD opportunity at the Institute of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, University of Edinburgh
Title: The within individual and cross-generational ef-
fects of dietary restriction on rates of ageing. Supervi-
sors: Craig Walling (Edinburgh), Neil Metcalfe (Glas-
gow), Dan Nussey (Edinburgh).
Description: Rates of ageing, or senescence, show re-
markable diversity, even between individuals within a
population. A greater understanding of the causes and
consequences of this variation in rates of ageing is im-
portant not only in the context of evolutionary biology
but also in our attempts to promote healthy ageing in
humans. Dietary restriction has been shown to increase
longevity across a diverse range of species. However,
life history theory predicts there are likely to be trade-
os between survival and reproduction. Thus although
dietary restriction may result in apparent alleviation
of ageing in traits related to survival, it may be as-
sociated with costs to reproductive traits, potentially
including a faster rate of reproductive senescence. Ad-
ditionally, the nutritional state of an individual at the
time of breeding may have long lasting eects on the
performance of its ospring. In particular, a mismatch
between parental and ospring nutritional environment
has been associated with an increase in the ospring's
susceptibility to diseases such as coronary heart disease
and type 2 diabetes in humans. However, few stud-
ies have addressed the question of how the interaction
between parental and ospring nutritional environment
might inuence the relative investment of ospring into
dierent life history traits such as growth, reproduction
and survival at dierent ages and how this might inu-
ence subsequent rates of ageing in these traits. The
aim of this PhD project will be to address these cur-
rent gaps in our knowledge of the causes of variation in
ageing rates using an experimental stickleback popula-
tion (/Gasterosteus aculeatus/).
The results of these experiments will allow a rare inves-
tigation of the eects of dietary restriction on the rates
of ageing in traits associated with growth, physical per-
formance and reproduction and will provide some of the
rst data on the eect of parental nutritional environ-December 1, 2012 EvolDir 39

EvolutionOfFemaleMateChoice
PhD opportunity at the Institute of Evolutionary Biol-

Project Title: Understanding female mating prefer-
ences in three-spined sticklebacks Supervisors: Dr
Craig Walling, Dr Per Smiseth
Description: The evolution of female mating prefer-
ences for extravagant male traits is one of the most
enigmatic questions in evolutionary biology. Despite
intensive theoretical and empirical study over the last
30 years, there is still considerable debate about how
female preferences arose. The aim of this PhD project
is to investigate female mating preferences in the stick-
leback (/Gasterosteus aculeatus/). The rst part of
the project will look at the quantitative genetic basis
of female mating preferences and their genetic corre-
lation with other traits such as male secondary sexual
traits, taking advantage of well-known in vitro fertili-sation techniques to set-up controlled breeding designs.
In addition, the potential for non-genetic inheritance of
female preferences through imprinting on the father's
phenotype and its implications for the evolution of fe-
male preferences and male traits will be investigated.
The second part of the project will then focus on ad-
dressing the question of the costs to females of express-
ing mating preferences by experimentally manipulating
choosiness between females and analysing the conse-
quences for fecundity.
This project will be based in the newly estab-
lished stickleback laboratory of Dr Craig Walling
(http://wildevolution.biology.ed.ac.uk/lkruuk/-
CraigWalling.html). IEB is one of the world's
leading Evolutionary Biology departments and has
considerable expertise in both quantitative genetics
and behavioural ecology.
Candidates should posses at least a 2.1 honours de-
gree or its equivalent in a relevant subject such as Bi-

UEdinburgh TreeEvolution
Title: Quantifying the potential for adaptation of na-40 EvolDir December 1, 2012
tive tree populations to climate change
Rapid climate change is perceived to be a signicant
threat to the long term persistence of our native tree
populations. It has been argued by some authors that
tree populations will fail to adapt because the rate of
climate change is too great compared to tree longevity,
because tree populations maintain insucient adap-
tive variation and because the contemporary landscape
is impermeable to dispersal, preventing range shifts.
Other authors have contended that most tree species
have high phenotypic plasticity, maintain high levels of
within-population genetic variation and have very eec-
tive gene dispersal capability, all characteristics which
should enable eective adaptive responses to take place.
The aim of this PhD is to investigate these questions by
collecting data on the extent of phenotypic plasticity,
the level of adaptive genetic variation and the extent
of gene ow among populations of native tree species,
including silver birch (Betula pendula) and rowan (Sor-
bus aucuparia). Together the data will be used to as-
sess the potential for adaptation to climate change for
birch and rowan in the UK. The PhD will make use of
established multisite provenance trials to measure phe-
notypic plasticity and genetic variation for a range of
traits important in adaptation to climate. This will
involve application of fast phenotyping techniques to
quantify physiological variation among and within pop-
ulations. Genetic markers will also be employed to es-
timate the extent of gene ow occurring among native
populations. Results from the PhD will be of great rel-
evance in the development of mitigation strategies for
native forests in the face of climate change.
The project is part of an ongoing collaboration between
CEH, Forest Research and the University of Edinburgh
and will be funded by Forestry Commission GB. The
successful candidate would be registered with the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh, but should expect to spend sig-
nicant amounts of time at each of the collaborating
Institutions, all in or around Edinburgh. The successful
candidate will have a strong motivation for the subject,
with a clear background in evolutionary biology. Ca-
pability for extended periods of eldwork is necessary
and good statistical skills would be an advantage.

for funding. Studentships will be awarded on the basis
of merit.Successful applicants will benet from working
within a lively research environment within the Cen-

wall Campus, near Falmouth at the College of Life and
Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter.
Bumblebees are key pollinators of crops and wild ow-
ering plants. Horizontally transmitted parasites pose a
large risk to these pollinating insects, as many of these
species have overlapping niches with ample opportuni-
ties for pathogens to infect novel host species. In this
project, you will use genomic tools to investigate trans-
mission networks in natural populations of bumblebees,
asking which ecological factors promote disease trans-
mission. This project will run in parallel to a large BB-December 1, 2012 EvolDir 41
SRC project studying and modelling the population dy-
namics and behaviour of bumblebee communities. Lo-
cal populations will be comprehensively sampled, al-
lowing you to study how pathogens are transmitted
between bumblebee colonies and species and how this
may impact on population-wide tness. By studying se-
quence evolution in rapidly evolving viral diseases, you
will be able to apply powerful genomic modeling ap-
proaches developed for emerging diseases, such as HIV,
to infer transmission pathways. These can be used to
identify potential transmission hotspots, such as par-
ticular host species, food plants or landscape features.
These eld results can then be experimentally tested
using lab or eld experiments. The work will have
practical relevance for understanding and managing the
health of vital pollinator populations.
The project will be co-supervised by Dr. Lena Wil-
fert and Dr. Juliet Osborne, with eld work being car-
ried out in collaboration with Dr. Alison Haughton
(Rothamsted) and Prof. Dave Goulson (University of
Stirling/University of Sussex). The student will also be
closely involved with the disease group at University of
Exeter in Cornwall, including Prof. Mike Boots, Prof.
Angus Buckling and Dr. Britt Koskella. It will combine
eldwork in the UK with molecular infection assays in
the lab. The work will heavily rely on molecular tech-
niques, such as quantitative PCR and sequencing, for
quantifying infections and for studying viral sequence
evolution. The student will be trained in these meth-
ods. Ideally, the candidate has a strong interest in ge-
netics and bioinformatics. Please contact Dr. Lena
Wilfert (lena.wilfert@ed.ac.uk) for informal enquiries.

PhD opportunity in Social Evolution Theory at the
University of Jyv askyl a, Finland
Eusocial organisms such as bees and ants pose a chal-
lenge for evolutionary theory because they exhibit al-
truistic traits that contradict the Darwinian principle
of individual tness maximization. Although a large
body of theory exists on the evolution of altruistic
traits, few studies have explicitly modelled the tran-
sition from a solitary lifestyle to eusociality, includ-
ing feedbacks between gene frequencies, colony dynam-
ics and population ecology that are a necessary part
of this process. We aim to ll this gap by building
models based on recent theoretical advances. Appli-
cants should have a degree in a relevant area (e.g. be-
havioural ecology, evolutionary biology, economics with
focus on game theory, physics, mathematics, computer
science), with some mathematical and computing skills
and a keen interest in evolutionary biology. The project
will be supervised by Lutz Fromhage at the University

Australian National University, Canberra. Funding is
provided by the Department of Biological and Envi-
ronmental Science to ll positions in two out of four

ParallelEvolutionCichlids
The Meyer lab at the University of Konstanz, Ger-

fering two fully-funded three-year PhD positions
Ecology and genomics of parallel speciation of cichlid
shes in Nicaraguan crater lakes
Project abstract The crater lakes in Nicaragua each
contain small adaptive radiations of endemic cichlid
sh. The species in these lakes often look astonish-
ingly similar (Elmer and Meyer 2011). These cases of
parallel evolution are the focus of research in the Meyer
lab and we are studying this phenomenon at dierent
levels of biological organization. We are looking for
two PhD students to join our team who are interested
in this from a (1) genetic (e.g., QTL-analyses) and ge-
nomic (e.g., comparative transcriptomics) perspective,
and (2) an ecological/experimental viewpoint. The eco-
logical genomics work aims to discover the genetic ba-
sis of (parallel) adaptations and next the functional
characterization of candidate genes. This approach in-
volves nextgeneration DNA sequencing technologies (Il-
lumina and Roche FLX platforms) in the Genomics
Center Konstanz and evo-devo work using transgenic
model sh (e.g., zebrash and medaka). We also plan
to conduct mark-recapture studies and other ecological
work in crater lakes in Nicaragua and are looking for
a Spanish-speaking student who would work for longer
periods of time in Nicaragua.
The successful applicants will participate in the Inter-
national Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Or-
ganismal Biology, the PhD program of the Max Planck
Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen and Radolfzell
and the University of Konstanz. All IMPRS students
are supported by stipends or contracts. The pro-44 EvolDir December 1, 2012
gram oers a dedicated teaching program, high qual-
ity research experience, and outstanding research facil-
ities in an inspiring research and living environment.
The working language is English. Each PhD student
receives individual supervision and mentoring and is
guided in her/his research work by a PhD advisory com-
mittee.
Qualication Applicants should hold a MSc or equiva-
lent degree in biology or a related discipline at the point
of enrollment. Queries should be mailed to the IMPRS
program oce: IMPRS@uni-konstanz.de
Deadline for the application is January 15, 2013. In-

ULausanne ComputationMolBiol
PhD positions in Computational Molecular Biology and
Phylogenetics
*Job description* The two PhD positions are part
of a collaborative project, funded by the Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation, between the groups of
Nicolas Salamin (Computational Biology and Phylo-
genetics, Department of Ecology and Evolution) and
Marc Robinson-Rechavi (Bioinformatics, Department
of Ecology and Evolution) at the University of Lau-
sanne, and the group of Bastien Chopard (Computer
Science Department) at the University of Geneva; all
three groups are members of the Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics.
The overall aim of the project is to develop and improve
the algorithms used to estimate the selective pressure
acting on DNA sequences by combining biological re-
alism and computational eciency. More specically,
the project is divided in two parts: - The rst one aims
at proposing novel algorithms to enable ecient paral-
lelisation of the likelihood calculations of codon mod-
els. The goal is to develop a true high-performance
computer approach to the optimisation of maximum
likelihood to study molecular evolution within a phy-logenetic context. - The second one aims at develop-
ing a Bayesian approach to estimate positive selection.
The goal is to propose novel approaches to facilitate the
identication of specic sites and lineages under dier-
ent types of selective pressure.
Both parts of the project will be enhanced by using
high performance computing facilities (e.g. ~IBM Blue
Gene/Q) available within the CADMOS center.
*Prole requirements* We are looking for autonomous
and ambitious students with enthusiasm for inter-
disciplinary work. The students will need to interact
productively with evolutionary biologists, genome bi-
ologists and computer scientists, and read the corre-
sponding range of scientic literature. Candidates must
have completed their Master's degree or equivalent in
a relevant eld.
The requirements for each part of the project include a
strong mathematical or statistical and computer science
background and deep interest in theoretical aspects of
evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. Previous ex-
perience with evolutionary biology and/or parallel com-
puting is a plus but not a requirement.
The successful candidates will be part of the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution of the University of
Lausanne, the Department of Computer Science of the
University of Geneva, as well as the Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics. Our research groups oer a supportive
and stimulating environment, with access to excellent
computer and academic facilities.

\Modelling the community context of host-parasite in-
teractions"
University of Liverpool, UK Supervisors: Dr AndyDecember 1, 2012 EvolDir 45
Fenton (Dept of Evolution, Ecology & Behaviour) Dr
Kieran Sharkey (Dept of Mathematical Sciences)
There is great interest in the community context of
host-parasite associations - hosts and parasites are not
isolated, but are embedded within wider ecological com-
munities. This leads to various important questions:
How do alternative hosts aect parasite dynamics?
How do parasites alter the stability of the wider com-
munity? To help address these questions we need a gen-
eral theory of the community context of host-parasite
interactions.
This studentship will develop such a theoretical frame-
work. First, motivated by a recently-obtained NERC
grant, in which we manipulate natural multihost-
parasite communities, the student will develop simple
community sub-models to explore how dierential host
susceptibility and parasite transmission mode interact
to shape multihost-parasite dynamics. Second, moti-
vated by on-going large-scale community-wide surveys,
the student will use network theory to explore how par-
asites spread through, and alter the stability of, ecolog-
ical communities. This general framework will greatly
aid data interpretation, and provide insight into the po-
tential impact of parasites on ecological communities.
The student will work closely with ecologists working
on natural host-parasite communities, and mathemati-
cians with expertise in network theory, and so will re-
ceive training in both theoretical and empirical host-
parasite ecology. Furthermore, they will be part of a di-
verse and active research environment, both within Liv-
erpool University and collaborating institutions (Uni-
versities of Edinburgh and Zurich). The project would
particularly suit a student with strengths in mathemat-
ical or computational biology, and network and/or eco-
logical theory.
This studentship is fully funded for UK residents, but
fees only for EU citizens. For informal enquiries please
contact Dr Andy Fenton (a.fenton@liverpool.ac.uk).
Applicants should send a CV, cover letter and contact
details of two academic referees to Mrs Linda Marsh

PhD available at the University of Manchester
Darwinian evolution is often assumed to be inherently
competitive, frequently characterized by the adage
the survival of the ttest. However, individuals do
not always operate as adversaries and cooperation is
widespread in many animals. Humans show innate pre-
dispositions to be moral and prosocial, and these ten-
dencies give rise to complex societies organized by social
and political institutions. Group living animals can also
be highly prosocial, as evidenced by cooperative breed-
ing, coalitionary support, consolation following conict,
social grooming and even policing of conict. Explain-
ing the evolution cooperation remains one of the great
problems for evolutionary biology, as it does not t with
the notion of selsh individuals and genes.
In evolutionary game theory, population structuring
has been shown to have strong impacts on the stability
of cooperation. However, such models have historically
used theoretical population structure rather than varia-
tion in group structure derived from observed networks
of interactions in animals. We have shown that group
structure in primates is highly conserved over evolu-
tionary time, which raises the question of whether these
group structures are important promoters of stable co-
operation.
This project will use agent-based models to explore how
variation in animal social networks impact on the stabil-
ity of cooperation. These models will simulate individ-
ual decisions about whether to cooperate, or not, with
others based both on the benets of cooperation and
patterns of interactions across dierent group struc-
tures. These models will also explicitly incorporate
individual characteristics such as dominance, learning
strategies, and enforcement behavior (i.e. punishment
and policing).

I am interested in the study of traits shaped by sexual
antagonistic coevolution driven by sexual conict be-
tween the sexes. Sexual conict is prevalent between
the sexes and has been shown to occur in a broad
range of taxa. In my research I work with the fruit
y /Drosophila melanogaster/, which is a widely used
model organism and also sexual conict has been widely
studied in this species. Within the project the success-
ful candidate will study how ecological factors might
alter sexual antagonistic trait expression and the conse-December 1, 2012 EvolDir 47
quences for male-female coevolution. This will be done
by combining molecular work with behavioural experi-
mental work to measure trait expression at the molec-
ular level combined with phenotypic tests and tness
estimates.
WWU is a large vibrant university hosting a num-
ber of excellent scientic institutions (http://www.uni-

ology provides a stimulating research environment with
a number of scientic groups researching on diverse top-
ics centred on dierent aspects of the study of Evolu-
tion. The town of Muenster itself is characterised by
its many students and presents a dynamic environment
with many cultural and social events throughout the
year (http://www.muenster.de/en/).
Qualications: I search a highly motivated student of
any nationality and those with the equivalent of a Mas-
ter's degree in biology are invited to apply. A back-
ground in any of the following subjects will be useful:
previous experience with Drosophila work, good molec-
ular skills, preferably experience with qPCR, a good
understanding of statistics. Applicants should have ex-
cellent communication skills. The working language of
the institute and the lab is English.

*Graduate Position at the University of Sheeld*
The Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Univer-
sity of Sheeld is currently accepting applications for
a PhD in the Laboratory of Gareth Fraser commencing
October 2013 on the following evo/devo project:
*Developing innovation from regeneration: evolution
and development of the puersh beak*
* *
Puershes are a recent and relatively simple genomic
model and are characterized by a bizarre modied and
reduced dentition, resembling a parrot-like beak com-
posed of just four teeth. This simple dental form is
attractive for further study and genetic manipulation
to understand the process of lifelong de novo tooth re-
placement and the development of novel form. The
puersh dental condition provides an unrivalled and
simple system to dissect the gene interactions responsi-
ble for both continuous tooth production and morpho-
logical modication to form a beak-like jaw. Speci-
cally this project seeks to identify the key genes that
regulate the process of continuous tooth replacement
V a mechanism that breaks down in mammals typi-
cally after only one replacement phase. This project
will involve the development of gene expression tech-
niques (including insitu hybridisation) to expand our
knowledge of genes responsible for tooth replacement
and evolutionary modication of these tissues. The
successful candidate will use genetic manipulation tech-
niques (constructing oligo-morpholinos) to knock down
and block specic gene function during puersh cran-
iofacial development, resulting in the predicted distur-
bance of continued replacement tooth development that
forms the beaked dentition. Essentially, this research
will target known regulators of stem-like cells (i.e., Wnt
and Notch genes) responsible for continued regulation,
maintenance and initiation of life-long tooth replace-
ment.
The Department of Animal and Plant Sciences cur-
rently has around 100 PhD students. These stu-
dents are funded mainly by the UK Research Coun-
cils, University Scholarships, Industry and from over-
seas. We are currently seeking applications for stu-
dentships in all areas of the department's research inter-
ests<http://www.sheeld.ac.uk/aps/prospectivepg/-

IslandFoxEvolution
We seek to recruit a highly motivated doctoral student
to pursue dissertation research on the evolutionary his-
tory of the island fox, *Urocyon littoralis*. The island
fox is smaller than its progenitor, the mainland gray
fox, and includes six subspecies, each restricted to a dif-ferent island in Southern California's Channel Islands
due to their unique migratory history during the Ice
Age and thereafter. Extreme population crashes have
occurred on several of the islands, leading to federal
protection for a subset of the subspecies. The work
will take advantage of fossils and historical samples
from museum collections, taken before the population
crashes, as well as recent samples.
The research will be part of a multidisciplinary project
(molecular, morphological and paleontological) involv-
ing collaboration between the Natural History Museum
of Los Angeles County, the Wrigley Institute for Envi-
ronmental Studies and the University of Southern Cal-
ifornia. This is a funded project and the Ph.D. student
will have ve years of support (including tuition remis-
sion) through a combination of RAships, TAships and
fellowships.
Analyses of genetic and morphological changes can
be used to address a number of important questions.
When did the fox arrive at each island and how much
migration has there been amongst islands? Were hu-
mans (Paleo-Indians) involved in the colonization of
each island? What is the genetic basis for the evolution
of dwarsm? How much genetic variation has been lost
due to population bottlenecks on the dierent islands?
Potential applicants are encouraged to contact either
Xiaoming Wang ( xwang@nhm.org) or Suzanne Ed-
mands (sedmands@usc.edu) for more information. Ap-
plications should be submitted to the Integrative and
Evolutionary Biology Graduate Program at the Univer-

UppsalaU 2 SpeciationGenomics
Speciation genomics
2 PhD positions at the Evolutionary Biology Centre of
Uppsala University, supervised by Prof Hans Ellegren
(see end of message for web page)
Advances in large-scale genomics open new opportuni-
ties in speciation research. It allows us to address ques-
tions such as the genes underlying the process of speci-
ation, the character of genomic divergence during spe-
ciation, and speciation-with-gene-ow. Flycatchers of
the genus Ficedula oer an excellent model system for
studies of these and related questions (see e.g. Nature
387:589-592, 411:45-50, Science 318:95-97). We have re-
cently sequenced and de novo assembled the ycatcher
genome (at 85x coverage and with a scaold N50 of
7.3 Mb) and performed genome-wide re-sequencing of
multiple individuals (each at 5x coverage) of the two
closely related species collared ycatcher and pied y-
catcher (Nature, in press; doi:10.1038/nature11584).
By this we have identied a number of 'divergence is-lands', many of which are associated with centromeres
and telomeres, potentially indicating a role for meiotic
drive in species divergence. We are now seeking new
PhD students to joi n this project in which coming re-
search will use data from whole-genome re-sequencing
of multiple populations (sympatric as well as allopatric)
and species, from a 50K SNP array (genotyping in pedi-
grees and population samples) and from the ycatcher
transcriptome and methylome. Genomic parameters
that will be analyzed include, for example, recombi-
nation rates, linkage disequilibrium, expression diver-
gence, and epigenetic modication. The precise direc-
tion of studies will be decided together with the suc-
cessful candidates.
The venue for these positions, the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre, is situated in recently-built localities in
central Uppsala. The working atmosphere is inter-
national with a regular recruitment of PhD students
and post-docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes
an exciting arena for multidisciplinary research in evo-
lutionary biology in a broad sense, housing some 300
scientists and graduate students, and with research
programs in, for example, ecology, genetics, genomics
and developmental biology. The scientic environ-
ment with numerous seminars, journal clubs and so-
cial activities oer excellent possibilities for contacts
and collaborations, and represents an ideal training for
students to become leading evolutionary biologists of
the future. A graduate school in 'The Genomics of
Phenotypic Diversity in Natural Populations' (http://-
www.ebc.uu.se/education/postgrad/gradschool/) pro-
vides a framework for courses and other activi-
ties for PhD students. Local platforms for next-
gen eration sequencing (http://www.scilifelab.uu.se)
and high-performance computational analyses (http:/-
/www.uppmax.uu.se) ensure immediate access to state-
of-the-art technology. Uppsala University is the oldest
university in Scandinavia and the city of Uppsala is a
vibrant student town with beautiful and easy accessible
surroundings conveniently situated close to Stockholm.
The positions, which are funded by a European Re-
search Council Advanced Investigator Grant, are ali-
ated with the Department of Evolutionary Biology - an
overview of the research activities in the environment
can be found at our web pages (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
Research/IEG/evbiol/). Thanks to a number of com-
petitive grants recently obtained, the environment has
expanded signicantly and houses 8 independent re-
search groups and about 20 PhD students, 20 post-
docs, and some bioinformaticians. A common theme
is that we address key questions in evolutionary biol-
ogy, like speciation, local adaptation, life history evo-
lution, genome and molecular evolution, using genomicDecember 1, 2012 EvolDir 51
approaches. Study organisms include natural bird and
plant populations, Neurospora, Drosophila, zebra sh,
domestic animals and humans. We have tight connec-
tions with several other research programs at the Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre.
The fully-funded (salary, research and travel expenses)
PhD positions are for four years.
Applicants must hold a Master degree, or are to ob-
tain a degree this academic year, in evolutionary bi-
ology, genetics or bioinformatics, or in related disci-
plines. Successful candidates are expected to display
enthusiasm, curiosity, creativity and dedication to the
project. Informal inquiries and applications should be
sent by email to Hans.Ellegren@ebc.uu.se. Applicants
must provide a CV, a statement of research interests
and the name and contact details of at least two refer-
ences. The positions remain open until lled.

population dynamics and evolutionary responses to an-
thropogenic change.
I am seeking a PhD student to work on applied and
fundamental questions in behavior, demography, popu-
lation ecology, and life history evolution of black bears.
* *
*Project: *The aim of this project is to help guide black
bear conservation by linking bear habitat selection pro-
cesses to both individual-based demography and pop-
ulation dynamics using state-of-the-art statistical and
modeling tools. The selected PhD student will work
on 30+ years of high quality, individual-based black
bear data (i.e., capture-recapture, GPS and telemetry
locations, nuisance conict calls, etc.) that were col-
lected by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife
NJDFW. This dataset oers enormous possibilities to
address applied questions and management solutions
directed at mitigating bear-human conicts. It also
provides opportunties to address basic research ques-
tions by relating individual performance and tness to
environmental and anthropogenic changes in New Jer-
sey; the state with the highest density of black bears
in the country. The combination of applied and ba-
sic research is the approach I favor in my lab. Itshould be noted that even though the student will be
working with an existing dataset, the student will also
have opportunities to participate in eld work each year
with NJDFW (summer bear captures and winter den
searches).
* *
*Funding: *All interested candidates must apply to
both USUs School of Graduate Studies, and the
S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney Doctoral Fellowships Pro-
gram. These fellowships will cover 75% of all ex-
penses (stipend, tuition, health insurance) over 4 years.
Matching funds (remaining 25%) have already been se-
cured, which is a sinequanon condition for a successful
application.
* *
*Requirements: *Minimum requirements for a success-
ful application are a cumulative 70th percentile (for
both verbal and quantitative) on GRE and cumula-
tive GPA of >3.5. Note that although 70th per-
centile scores are not required for the Quinney fellow-
ships, nominees without these scores will be at a dis-
tinct disadvantage. Paper(s) in peer-reviewed journals

Evolution of reproductive strategies in livebearing sh
The Experimental Zoology Group at Wageningen Uni-
versity (the Netherlands) is looking to recruit a Ph.D.
student interested in evolutionary biomechanics. Our
research seeks to understand the evolution of repro-
ductive strategies in the livebearing sh family Poe-
ciliidae. This project is nancially supported by the
Dutch Earth and Life Sciences foundation (ALW).
Job description Viviparity (livebearing) is known to
carry a locomotory cost to females during their repro-
ductive phase, due to an increase in physical burden and
change in morphology/physiology aecting the power
output of females and their interaction with the imme-
diate surroundings. In our lab we study the evolution
of two reproductive strategies in the livebearing sh
family Poeciliidae: placentation (post-fertilization ma-
ternal provisioning by means of a placenta) and super-
fetation (the ability to carry multiple litters at dier-
ent developmental stages). We hypothesize that these
strategies evolved because they reduce the locomotory
costs of gestation without sacricing a females repro-
ductive output (each strategy notably achieving this
in a fundamentally dierent way). If true, then these
two strategies may impart a signicant tness advan-
tage to females in high-performance demanding envi-

WesternU InvasiveSocialInsectsGraduate position: population genetics of invasive in-
sects. The Social Biology Group at Western University
(Canada) has an opening for an MSc or PhD student
with an interest in invasive biology of social insects.
The project will focus on the Eastern subterranean
termite, which is introduced to urban environments
across southern Ontario. The student will generate
and analyze population genetic data to estimate the
number and origin of invasion events, relate termite
social biology to their invasive success, and predict
future patterns of gene ow across spatial and tem-
poral scales. Moreover, it is anticipated that some
eldwork and liaising with homeowners and pest con-
trollers will be an important part of sample collect-
ing. The suitable candidate will have (or develop) an
interest in invasive biology, social evolution and ge-
netics. Some background information is available in

hours/week) teaching assistant and laboratory prep as-
sistant in the introductory biology program for the
Spring 2013 semester. The position has two main
components, teaching and behind-the-scenes laboratory
preparation.
Teaching component: The primary teaching responsi-
bility of the position is to lead laboratory sections of up
to 16 students in the Biology Department's new genet-
ics and evolution Gateway course, Biology202L. Each
Biology 202L section meets weekly for 2.5 hours for a
combined hands-on laboratory/problem-based learning
session. Additional teaching responsibilities include (a)
attending and taking notes at all course lectures in-
cluding the weekly large discussion section and viewing
the online lectures, (b) grading weekly student written
assignments and occasional oral presentations, (c) help-
ing with the preparation and grading of mid-semester
hourly and nal exams, and (d) assisting students dur-
ing oce hours and otherwise mentoring students as
beginning biologists. TAs also attend weekly prep ses-
sions during the semester on Monday mornings.
Teaching assistants should plan to arrive in Durham,
NC, on or before January 7, 2013.
Prep component: The second set of duties associated
with the position is to assist in the prep. work for
the teaching labs in Biology 201L and 202L, as deter-
mined by the Lab Administrator. Responsibilities in-clude setting up and putting away equipment and spec-
imens for laboratory exercises, maintaining supplies in
lab rooms between sections, cleaning glassware, assist-
ing with eld collection of live specimens, and helping
to care for a diverse collection of invertebrate animals
in salt-water aquaria. The lab prep workload is likely
to require evening (until 10 PM) and/or early morning
(8 AM) work.
Salary: The projected salary for the position is $9000,
pending funding. Employment begins on January 9,
2013 and ends May 10, 2013, with most of the spring
break o, with payment made in 5 equal amounts on
the 25th of each month starting in January and ending
in May. Full-time teaching/prep employees are eligible
for health plans made available by the University.
Qualications: Applicants should have a strong, varied
background in biology, especially genetics and evolu-
tion, with a superior science GPA. A very important

able; experience tending Drosophila is a plus. Teaching
assistants in Biology 202L are expected to be actively
engaged with their students in all aspects of the course
and to serve as role models and mentors. Because they
are a vital part of the introductory biology teaching
team both in the classroom and behind the scenes, full-
time assistants must be willing to commit themselves
fully to the responsibilities of the position described
above and as determined by the faculty members in
charge of the Gateway course.

MolEvolutionAgeing
Research Assistant: Molecular Evolution of Excep-
tional Ageing, University College Dublin
Ageing is the gradual and irreversible breakdown of liv-
ing systems associated with the advancement of time,
which leads to an increase in vulnerability and eventual
mortality. It is considered as one of the most famil-
iar but least well-understood processes in biology, with
hundreds of theories developed about ^ awhy' and ^ ahow'
we age. Despite recent advances in ageing research,
the intrinsic complexity of the ageing process has pre-
vented a full understanding of this process, therefore,
ageing remains a grand challenge in contemporary bi-
ology. The new European Research Council funded re-
search team that Dr. Teeling is gathering will tackle
this challenge by uncovering the molecular mechanisms
of halted ageing in a unique model system, the bats. We
will couple state of the art-eld biology with cutting-
edge next generation comparative genomic and tran-
scriptomic studies to address this challenge.
A Research Assistant (RA) position is available for up
to ve years is available in the Teeling Laboratory.
Duties:
The RA will aid in the generation of all molecular data
for the duration of the ERC project. The RA will en-
sure the smooth running of the laboratory, purchas-
ing of consumables, shipping of samples and will help
maintain the DNA and RNA collections. The RA will
aid the PhD students and postdoc in the generation
of molecular data. The RA will be actively involved
in the teaching and supervision of undergraduates and
MSc students and will also help train the PhD students
in laboratory skills. The RA will assist the PI in neces-
sary day-to-day running of the project when required.
Mandatory Experience:
- Honours BSc in Biology or equivalent
- Experience in the generation of molecular data in the
laboratory- e.g. PCR, DNA extraction, RNA extrac-
tion, mtDNA isolation, RNA generation and analyses,
DNA preservation, sequencing.
- Experience in working in a large molecular laboratory
- Understanding of data base development and mainte-82 EvolDir December 1, 2012

Vacancy number 212248
Job description
Research description Dispersal is the movement of indi-
viduals from their birthplace to their location of breed-
ing. Dispersal plays a key role in social-organisation,
the mating system and social evolution. Behaviour,
such as dispersal, may be inuenced by the presence
and behaviour of other individuals, which is the social
environment in which the behaviour is expressed. Con-
sequently as social behaviour evolves, the environment
it is expressed in does as well. Therefore evolution of
social behaviour is complicated by the need to consider
the role of both the social environment in which individ-
uals live, and the degree of social interactions between
individuals on the expression of individual behaviours.
The combined eects of these have rarely been consid-
ered. The proposed project will investigate how the
social environment aects the expression of dispersal,
and the consequences this has for individual lifetime
tness parameters. We will use eld experiments to
manipulate social interactions and phenotype frequen-
cies in wild Seychelles warbler populations to investi-
gate how specic perturbations inuence the expression
of individual behaviours and subsequent tness. There
are very few studies that have experimentally manipu-
lated the social environment in the wild. For our ex-
periments, we will focus on the islands of Cousin (high
density and saturated population) and Denis (rapidly
expanding from very low density), for which we have
comprehensive behavioural and pedigree data.
This project is closely linked to the TopGrant funded
post-doctoral position in Theoretical Evolutionary
Ecology. The close collaboration between molecular,
theoretical and behavioural researchers, along with ac-
cess to the long-term Seychelles warbler dataset, pro-
vides a unique opportunity to forge a link between con-
ceptual models and real-world data.

search group which is part of the Centre for Ecological
and Evolutionary Studies at the University of Gronin-

mechanisms leading to population dierentiation and
species separation. A second project investigates the
extent of population dierentiation in European and
North American populations of particularly widespread
species (including eld work). We further use exper-
imental evolution over many generations at hot and
cool temperatures in the laboratory to identify the
thermal traits contributing to continental and latitu-
dinal population dierentiation. A third project stud-
ies the genetics and genomics of population dierenti-
ation of widespread sepsid species (genome size: 200-
300 Mb) using whole-genome sequencing, to examine
the molecular genetic basis of the ongoing speciation
process and to identify candidate genes involved in
speciation and/or dierentiation hot-spots within the

AlleleMeanVar program
Can anyone recommend a program that will calculate
allele size mean and variance per locus from a data set
of microsatellite allele fragment sizes (not number of
repeats). Yes, I can do this in Excel, but it is cumber-
some, especially when there is missing data in dierent
places in the spreadsheet.

DIYABC answers
Dear all, Thank you for the reassuring feedback on
DIYABC. I have received a number of emails that seem
to agree on the following:
1. This beta version can be temperamental also with
Windows XP;
2. The \START" screen, when everything seems to
be ready to rock & roll, if often represents a 'freezing'
moment;
3. Sometimes, even if it seems to freeze and to 'not
respond', it may still produce the simulation data;
4. It doesn't seem to enjoy much changes in the default
settings;
5. Sometimes you need to start the analysis again 2 or
3 times, and then it works ne;
6. I personally got it to work after trying several times
and removing the nal mtDNA sequence (although it
had accepted it was there and took me through all the
settings);
7. I also banged on the desk furiously several times,96 EvolDir December 1, 2012
but I am unsure it had any inuence on the outcome.
8. There is a general sense of relief and expectation for
the release of the new version, which should be with us
before the end of the year.
Thank you so much again and good luck.
Stefano.

DIYABC problems
Dear all, I was very happily working with DIYABC,
and, suddenly, it stopped responding. I've tried many
times to start again, simplifying scenarios, shortening
runs, using various numbers of cores. The same thing
keeps happening: I prepare all the settings and progress
smoothly until the nal screenshot where I just need to
press 'START' to build the simulated data sets, and
as soon as I click, it freezes. The task manager just
tells me that the program is not responding. I am run-
ning v1.0.4.46beta on a WindowsXP platform - as sug-
gested - and on exactly the very same PC on which the
software has been running smoothly in the past two
months. Does anyone have any idea of what might be
happening?
Thanks,

Evolutionary Demography Society
Announcing the Evolutionary Demography Society,
please circulate
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the formation of the
Evolutionary Demography Society (EvoDemoS)
and to invite interested researchers to join. While many
societies include life-history evolution or evolutionarydemography within the range of topics they consider,
no active society focuses on these topics across taxa and
disciplines. EvoDemoS is intended to ll this gap.
EvoDemoS is an interdisciplinary scientic society ded-
icated to the study of the interactions of ecology and
evolutionary biology with demography, including but
not limited to patterns of mortality, reproduction and
migration over age, stage and state and the evolution-
ary processes that produce those patterns. All taxa
and methodologies are of interest. Our primary goal is
to facilitate communication between researchers, and
as such we are pleased to oer free membership for
2013 to any interested researcher. We invite members
from students to established experts. We will orga-
nize yearly meetings to provide a specic forum for
evolutionary demography. Our rst meeting will be in
Odense, Denmark in October of 2013, and will be open
only to society members. Membership can be gained
by emailing your name, preferred email address, ali-
ation and a sentence describing your research interests
to: evodemo-list@demogr.mpg.de
Questions and comments can be addressed to this same
address.

Fst data
Hi All,
Does anyone know of a software package that can take
allele frequency data, e.g. from multiple allozymes, and
use these to calculate Fst values? I am trying to make
use of data from some older papers that include a ta-
ble of allele frequencies in each population, but never
calculated pairwise Fst between populations. The data
in the tables is total allele frequencies for each popula-
tion, rather than by individual genotypes. i.e. there is
no information on which individuals had which alleles
or which alleles for a given locus occurred with which
alleles for another locus, so the types of iniles used
for e.g. Fstat, Arelquin, Genepop, etc would not be
possible to make.
Data example: Locus Allele Pop1 Pop2 pgm A 0.5 0.3
B 0.5 0.7 Pgi A 0.3 0.5 B 0.7 0.5
Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions, Amy

Human exome positions

Haiwei Luo <hluo2006@gmail.com >Human exome positions answers
Hello,
I thank the following people who responded my ques-
tion posted several days ago. Now I received a couple
of great responses. Please see the following messages.
(1) From Jason E Stajich this is documented at
the ensembl site, I would read more on their
help pages and just looking at the base folder
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub
For your question you want the GTF le:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current gtf/homo sapiens/Homo sapiens.GRCh37.69.gtf.gz
(2) From Micha3Kabza
Ensembl FTP (http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/-
ftp/index.html) contains GTF les with exon positions
or you can download them using BioMart (http://-
www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) . There is no
explicit intron representation of introns in Ensembl,
however. I've recently developed software that can
help with your problem. It's available at http://-
galago.amu.edu.pl/wendigo/. You can use the SQLite
databases from the webpage or use Python modules to
access them. Keep in mind that Wendigo uses 0-based
coordinates (exactly like UCSC, unlike Ensembl).
Currently it has no citation, but the paper is under
review in BMC Genomics.
(3) From Anna
You can get the exon and intron positions from UC
Santa Cruz genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/-
). Below are links to answers to questions similar to
yours.
https://lists.soe.ucsc.edu/pipermail/genome/2011-
August/026943.html http://seqanswers.com/forums/-
showthread.php?t=3D5803 (4) From Mehmet Somel
I get the positions from Ensembl Biomart: http://-
www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/ In attributes,
you choose \structures".
(5) From Timothy O'Connor It depends on which
gene models/annotation you decide to use. One tool
that should give you what you want, plus a whole
lot more, is SeattleSeq (http://snp.gs.washington.edu/-
SeattleSeqAnnotation137/). At the end of the list of
things to include is two dierent gene model annota-
tions where you can choose one or both versions.December 1, 2012 EvolDir 99
For large lists of variants it might be best to use the
custom format split into multiple les. But it also has
the capacity to directly annotate VCF les (which also
may need to be split if the number of variants is greater
than 500K).
(6) From Julien Roux You can nd this in the GTF
le describing the gene models. It can be downloaded
together with the genome sequence le from: http://-

NewMorphometricSoftware in R
Hello all,
We are happy to announce the release of GeoMorph: a
morphometrics package in R for the collection and anal-
ysis of landmark-based geometric morphometric data.
It is available on the CRAN package website.
Geomorph provides routines for all stages of a geo-
metric morphometric analysis. It allows one to read,
manipulate, and digitize 2D and 3D landmark data,
generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for
points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses
of shape variation and covariation, and provide graphi-
cal depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation.
Most of geomorph's functions are designed for re-
searchers interested in testing ecological and evolu-
tionary hypotheses of shape variation and covariation.
Methods are available to:
Data -read existing landmark data les into R (nts, tps,
Morphologika format) -digitize 3D landmarks from sur-
face images within R -estimate missing landmarks on
specimens
Shape -Superimpose specimens using GPA (for both
landmarks and semilandmarks)
Analyses -Anova/regression designs -
integration/modularity analyses -analysis of phe-
notypic trajectories -assessment of phylogenetic signal
for shape data
Visualization -scatterplots of shapes -shape deforma-
tion plots -plots of allometric trajectories -plotting phy-
logenies in shape space
In the coming months we will add additional functions
of interest to evolutionary biologists.December 1, 2012 EvolDir 101

genotype matrix in PC, Mac or Linux, and it admits
data coding formats compatible with all the molecu-
lar techniques used in the investigation of biodiversity,
either codominant (allozymes, nuclear microsatellites,
SNP coded with two letters per genotype), or dominant
(chloroplast microsatellites coded with three digits per
haplotype, AFLPs, RFLPs, ISSR or any other molec-
ular technique that can be binary-coded, or DNA se-
quence matrices). DNA sequence, SNP coded with one
letter per genotype, and RAD matrices are considered
dominant by T4 2.0.0, and they can only be imported
to this version of T4 from fasta, mega, nexus, or phylip
les.
T4-2.0.0 is suitable for matrices containing an unlimited
number of alleles per locus, loci, individuals, popula-
tions, or taxa (diploid individuals, in the case of codom-
inant data). The only limit is the space available in the
hard disk of the user's computer. Most matrices resi-
dent in T4's matrix explorer can be transformed easily,
swiftly and simultaneously into the input formats of one
or several of the 38 most commonly used population ge-
netic software (and for any possible combination of the
populations that each matrix contains).
T4-2.0.0 also allows the users to quickly publish \ge-
netic diversity digests" in the Demiurge information
system. Such \digests" are peer-reviewed and made up
by a geo-referenced T4 genotype matrix plus any an-
cillary information relevant to its interpretation that
the authors see t to include (see an example of a
published digest in http://www.demiurge-project.org/-
matrix digests/14).
To use T4-2.0.0, just register in the Demiurge informa-
tion system by clicking onhttp://demiurge-project.org/register Examples of all
types of matrices suitable to be imported to T4 are
available in the T4 download page (http://demiurge-
project.org/download t4). An exhaustive user's man-
ual is available upon opening the software (clicking on
\Help/Help contents")
A note about the T4 v 2.0.0 software and the Demi-
urge information system has been submitted to Mol.
Ecol. Res. A short video summarizing the utilities of
this software and the Demiurge system can be seen clik-
ing on http://vimeo.com/29828406 . Previous versions
of T4 have been downloaded and used by researchers
from 26 countries, and some of the digests published in
Demiurge are already associated with papers in several
impact journals.
T4-2.0.0 and the Demiurge system are deliverables re-
sulting from several work packages in the project Demi-
urgo (MAC/1/C20). These work packages were co-
funded by the Programa de Cooperaci on Transnacional

Tucson Hackathon Jan28-Feb1
Phylogenies! Hacking! Tucson in January!
An implicit promise of the Tree of Life project is that,
ultimately, expert knowledge of species phylogeny will
be accessible and usable by everybody. In other words,
we will all be able to get the species trees we need, in
a useable form, when we need them. The Phylotastic
project aims to make that vision a reality, by develop-
ing a loosely coupled system of components that, in re-
sponse to a user's query (a list of taxa plus conditions),
will rectify names, nd suitable source trees, prune and
graft to get the right species, estimate branch lengths,
and return the results with metadata on sources and
methods.
In June 2012, the HIP (Hackathons, Interoperabil-
ity, Phylogenies) working group of NESCent staged
a hackathon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)
to prototype components of a Phylotastic system, and
implement demos to show their potential. Thanks to
25 participants who responded to an open call (just like
this one), that hackathon was an extraordinary success
(see http://phylotastic.org/).
Now we are gearing up for a second hackathon, to take
another step toward providing computable, convenient,
credible access to the Tree of Life. We aim to recruit
a diverse group of participants, including students, fac-
ulty, postdocs, and sta of both genders and from dif-
ferent backgrounds. Only some of the seats at the
hackathon will be lled by expert hackers who spend
their time coding. We also need folks who can:
* Provide knowledge of workows and downstream uses
of trees * Design user interfaces * Test software * Make
screencasts, develop tutorials, and document user ex-
periences
Applications are now being accepted to Phylotastic 2,
which will take place January 28th, 2013 to February
1st, 2013 at the BIO5 facility in warm and sunny Tuc-
son, AZ (http://bio5.arizona.edu/about-bio5). Infor-
mation on how to apply is provided below. Partial
support (and, if funds allow, full support) for travel,
food and lodging will be available to each successful
applicant who indicates need. We particularly welcome
applications from women and members of underrepre-
sented groups.
To understand how you might be able to contribute, re-view the slideshow (ppt format, http://bit.ly/RWRgIc,

LastCall
Dear Evoldir{
This is the last call to apply for the Phylotastic
hackathon at the Bio5 facility in Tucson, Jan 28 to
Feb 1, 2013, sponsored by Hackathons, Interoperabil-
ity, Phylogenies (HIP), a NESCent working group.
Our aim is to build a distributed delivery system for
expert knowledge of species phylogeny, i.e., the Tree of
Life. At the rst hackathon, we built some components
and sketched out how they would work together. ThisDecember 1, 2012 EvolDir 103
time, we aim to recruit a diverse set of scientists, pro-
grammers, and scientist-programmers to build on our
previous results, focusing on supporting use-cases, in-
tegrating processes, and adapting end-user tools.
If that sounds interesting, please scan the materials be-
low and consider how you could be a part of this ex-
citing project. The application period closes on Friday
(http://tinyurl.com/PhyloTastic2; details below). Re-

current research aims to contribute to better under-
stand demographic and ecological processes playing a
role in the ongoing decline of the population Rus us-
ing the Netherlands during migratory stopover. The
eldwork consists in the monitoring of colour-banded
birds in Southwest Friesland, a characteristic Dutch
meadow area in the north of The Netherlands. We
collect data on the timing of migration, habitat use,
phenotype characteristics, feeding and reproductive be-
haviour of the birds; but you will also assist with the
banding of the birds, blood sampling, and data entry.
Volunteers and students involved will live together in
our eld station in a small village along the shore of
Lake IJsselmeer.

WillametteU Volunteers
PollinationCoevolution
The Smith lab at Willamette University is soliciting
applications for volunteers to participate in eld re-
search studying the pollination biology and coevolution
of Joshua trees (*Yucca brevifolia*) and yucca moths
(genus * Tegeticula*) from late March to mid April of
2013.
Pending the availability of funding, volunteers will as-
sist in the completion of pollination experiments in a106 EvolDir December 1, 2012
plant hybrid zone located in central Nevada. Partici-
pation will require living at a remote eld site continu-
ously for approximately four weeks. Cost of transporta-
tion to the eld site will be covered and food while in
the eld will be covered.
Successful applicants will be of above-average physical
tness (i.e., capable of walking 10 miles per day while
carrying heavy and awkward loads, able to climb a 6'
ladder, and able to lift 40 lbs) and be enthusiastic about
living and working closely with others in challenging
conditions. The eld site has no running water, lit-
tle opportunity for personal space and time, and no
phone/internet services. Daily temperatures may drop
below freezing or exceed 90 F. Wind and sandstorms
are very common.
Volunteers must have an educational background in bi-
ology or a related eld (there is no degree requirement,
but a familiarity with ecology and natural history is
necessary) and must provide their own camping equip-
ment. Essential gear includes a fully-sealable tent capa-
ble of withstanding strong winds (i.e., a 4-season tent),
a sleeping pad, a sleeping bag rated to 20 degrees F,
and backpack with at least a 40 liter capacity.
Prospective volunteers should submit a CV or resume,
the name and contact information for one or more pro-
fessional references, and a letter describing their inter-
est in the project by email to csmith@willamette.edu .
Please include the words 'Volunteer Field Assistant' in
the subject line of your message.
Screening of applicants will begin on December 16th,
2012, and continue until all positions are lled. Finalstang decisions will be dependent on funding.

EvolutionaryGenomics
Postdoc and PhD position in evolutionary genomics -
Kiel University, Germany
Topic: Evolutionary genomics of host-parasite interac-
tions
Host-parasite coevolution is predicted to have complex
consequences on the genetic architecture of both inter-
acting species. These consequences may relate to the
mechanisms that (i) are of direct relevance to the in-
teraction (e.g., resistance, pathogenicity), (ii) associate
with a possible cost of co-adaptation (e.g. life-history
trade-os), or (iii) increase evolutionary rates (e.g., re-
combination). The advertised positions will be involved
in the genomic and population genetic analysis of host
and parasite material generated through evolution ex-
periments within the German priority programme SPP
1399 on host-parasite coevolution (See: http://ieb.uni-
muenster.de/spp/). The project aims at understand-
ing the genomic changes that result from such coevo-
lutionary interactions in three model taxa, the micro-
parasite /Bacillus thuringiensis/ and two of its inver-
tebrate hosts, the nematode/Caenorhabditis elegans/
and the insect /Tribolium castaneum/.
The project is funded by the German Science Foun-
dation (postdoc position according to 100% TV-L 13;
PhD position according to 65% TV-L 13). It will
be based in the Department of Evolutionary Ecology
and Genetics at the University of Kiel, Northern Ger-
many, led by Hinrich Schulenburg (www.uni-kiel.de/-
zoologie/evoecogen/). The positions will be for three
years; extensions may be possible. The project is part
of the German priority programme SPP 1399 on host-
parasite coevolution and thus includes comprehensive
interactions with various research groups across Ger-
many and abroad (e.g., Portugal and US). The de-
partment itself provides an international and interac-
tive atmosphere, while Kiel University and connected
institutes (e.g., Max Planck Institute in Ploen) oer
a stimulating research environment with a particular
focus on evolutionary biology and also /C. elegans/ ge-
netics. The city of Kiel is a medium-sized pleasant townlocated at the coast of the Baltic Sea. It is the capi-
tal of the most Northern state of Germany, Schleswig-
Holstein. It oers many opportunities for leisure ac-
tivities, including theatres, an opera, the Schleswig-
Holstein classical music festival, the heavy metal festi-
val in Wacken, sailing, surng, cycling, and the famous
festivities of the \Kieler Woche" { one of the largest
sailing events in Europe.
Requirements for positions: PhD (for postdoc position)
or Master (for PhD position) in biology, bioinformatics,
or related topic; high motivation; excellent background
in bioinformatics and/or genomic analysis and/or popu-
lation genetics; teamwork; ideally some experience with
host-parasite interactions; uency in English.

TropicalForestBiodiversity
Postdoctoral Fellowship in tropical forest evolution and
biodiversity
Job Summary
Fixed term for 24 months, available from 1 February 1
2013
This post is part of the NERC funded project 'Niche
Evolution of South American Trees and its Conse-
quences'. The project aims to make a fundamental
advance in our knowledge of the processes that have
created patterns of diversity in the tropics by gaining
a better understanding of the evolutionary timing and
rate of biome switching in plant lineages. Such patterns114 EvolDir December 1, 2012
of biome switching are not only of interest for studies
of plant diversication, but also have far-reaching im-
plications for understanding forest ecology and the con-
servation of evolutionary (phylogenetic) diversity as a
result of land-use or climate change.
The project focuses on the rain forest, seasonally dry
forest and savanna biomes of South America, and the
postdoc will take a leading role in eldwork, data gen-
eration, data analysis and paper-writing.
The project aims to:
integrate plot and community survey data from all
three biomes from a wide variety of sources to create a
dataset of oristic composition unparalleled in its eco-
logical breadth and detail, spanning ~1300 sites. We
will work at on all tree genera and at the species level
in Leguminosae (the legume family) across all plots
quantify the climatic and edaphic niches of: (i) all ade-
quately sampled genera; and (ii) all adequately sampled
species of Leguminosae
reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of: (i) all gen-
era found at all inventory sites in all biomes; and (ii)
of species of Leguminosae found at >10 plots across all
biomes, using existing and de novo sequence data
These datasets will then be used to understanding the
timing, rate and nature of biome switching and niche
evolution in South American trees.
You will have a completed or soon to be completed (by
start of the post) PhD with a background in plant evo-
lution, systematics, ecology, or biogeography. You will
need to have eldwork experience and good skills in
quantitative scientic methods, allied to good commu-
nication skills. An ability to work in an international
team will also be needed, along with some level of u-
ency in Spanish and/or Portuguese.
The work will be based in the UK at Leeds (rst 9
months) and Edinburgh (subsequent 15 months) al-
though you will work closely with all partners involved
in the project in Brazil, Peru and Bolivia. The rst part
of the post will focus mainly on eldwork and data col-
lection and the second part principally on data analysis
and writing.

Lyon France MouseEvolution
POST-DOCTORAL POSITION: MOUSE MOLAR
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT IGFL, Lyon,
France
In the Mus genus, some mice feature a \prestyle" (kind
of ridge) on the anterior part of their rst upper molar:
this has been observed repeatedly in island populations,
as well as is several laboratory strains, and correlates
with a large body size. Our lab is involved in a col-
laborative project aiming at deciphering the processes
beyond this remarkable case of parallel teeth evolution.
A post-doctoral fellow will be recruited to take charge
of the evo-devo aspects of this work. In particular,
she/he will look at the embryonic origin of this prestyle
in lab strains selected for large body size and in strains
established from wild-trapped mice. She/he will no-
tably test a model proposed in Renaud et al. (Plos
One 6(5):e18951 2011), whereby the evolution of the
prestyle may involve a variation in the degree of incor-
poration of an abortive tooth bud found at the anterior
edge of the developing rst molar.
The candidate will demonstrate high motivation and
the ability to independently manage aspects of the
project determined to be her/his responsibility, while
interacting with a collaborative group. A good general
background in developmental biology/morphogenesis is
essential. Good knowledge of evolutionary developmen-116 EvolDir December 1, 2012
tal biology and/or a previous experience with a rodent
model would be an asset. Ideally, the candidate will
have skills in staining and imaging methods (e.g. im-
munostainings, confocal microscopy) and some training
with dissecting/manipulating embryos under a stere-
omicroscope.
A 18-months position (ANR grant funded) is on oer,
and the candidate will be provided assistance to nd
follow funding. Expected starting date: between Jan-
uary 2013 and September 2013.
The Molecular Zoology group is part of the Institute for
Functional Genomics of Lyon. We have been interested
in rodent molar development and evolution since 2004.
In September 2012, we moved to a newly built and fully
equipped building in Lyon. The institute hosts interna-
tional teams and largely uses English for internal com-
munication. http://ig.ens-lyon.fr Contact: CV and

sor Andrew Pomiankowski and Dr Nick Lane. Poten-
tial topics include: possible origins of natural selection
on genetically encoded metabolism in primordial envi-
ronments; the coevolution of parasitic replicators - the
ancestors of viruses - alongside true cells; the costs and
benets of multicellularity related to dierent modes of
feeding (phagocytosis vs. osmotrophy) in which there
is scope for cooperation and cheating over 'common
goods'; the evolution of mating types and true sexes
in multicellular organisms coincident with the develop-
ment of germ/soma dierentiation; the transfer of mi-
tochondrial genes to the eukaryotic nucleus and conse-
quent loss of mitochondrial genes due to sexual conict
over gene expression.
The 2020 Science programme is a joint collaboration be-
tween UCL, Oxford University and Microsoft Research
Cambridge, now into its second year. It is focused on

MolEvolutionAgeing
Postdoctoral Position: Molecular Evolution of Excep-
tional Ageing, University College Dublin
Ageing is the gradual and irreversible breakdown of liv-
ing systems associated with the advancement of time,
which leads to an increase in vulnerability and eventual
mortality. It is considered as one of the most famil-
iar but least well-understood processes in biology, with
hundreds of theories developed about why and how we
age. Despite recent advances in ageing research, the in-
trinsic complexity of the ageing process has prevented a
full understanding of this process, therefore, ageing re-
mains a grand challenge in contemporary biology. The
new European Research Council funded research team
that Dr. Teeling is gathering will tackle this challenge
by uncovering the molecular mechanisms of halted age-
ing in a unique model system, the bats. We will couple
state of the art-eld biology with cutting-edge next gen-
eration comparative genomic and transcriptomic stud-
ies to address this challenge.
A postdoctoral position for up to ve years is available
in the Teeling Laboratory.
The postdoc will be expected to:
Create the algorithms and pipelines needed to identify
and download the vast amount of ageing related ge-
nomic data across mammals Analyse these data using
an evolutionary, phylogenetics and network approach
Oversee de novo trancriptomic assembly and analysesof population level transcriptomes from long-lived wild
bats. Integrate all molecular data generated to uncover
the causal mechanisms of halted ageing in bats. Inter-
act and help supervise other members of the team.
Mandatory Requirements:
PhD in Comparative Genomics and or Comparative
Transcriptomics Experience in assembling Next Gen-
eration Sequencing data particularly whole transcrip-
tomes Experience in developing / utilising novel bioin-
formatic search pipelines and algorithims for the anal-
yses of comparative genome data An understanding of

Post-Doc: Multilevel Selection and the Evolution of
Human Behavior
University of Jyv askyl a, Finland
JOB DESCRIPTION: A postdoctoral position is
available in a project studying the origin and impli-
cations of group structure in human social behavior
and cultural change. Questions like: What main-
tains within-group cooperation in social dilemma
situations? have been researched extensively, both
theoretically and empirically. However, most of this
research considers processes in isolated, homogenous
groups. In reality, human social interactions take
place in an environment where there are multiple
levels of organizational hierarchy, and where thereis heterogeneity among individuals and groups. The
central tenet of current research project is that in
order to understand the evolutionary origins and the
day-to-day processes of human social behavior and
culture, the multiple levels of human organizational
hierarchy must be given explicit consideration. The
applicant will be involved with design and execution of
computer-mediated decision experiments to study how
the interplay of between- and within-group interactions
aects conict and cooperation in human groups. The
research project also involves a development of theory
to complement the empirical studies, and theoretically
oriented researchers are strongly encouraged to apply.
The successful applicant is expected to play a key role
in developing research within the research topic. See
http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/-
1655/355 and http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/-
content/278/1723/3428 for previous published work in
the group.
DURATION: The successful applicant can start the
project in January 2013, but later starting dates are
also negotiable. The position is rst lled for two years,
but can be extended up to ve years.
SALARY: 37,000 - 41,000 per annum, depending on
qualications. Healthcare included.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: PhD in Biology,
Mathematics, IT, Economics, or a related eld. The
applicant must possess a thorough understanding of
evolutionary concepts. Excellent written and good oral
English skills are required.
PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: Good skills in ex-
perimental design and in statistical analysis of experi-
mental data. Experience in programming and/or math-
ematical modelling is a denite plus. THE PLACE
& THE PEOPLE: The position is at the Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the Univer-
sity of Jyv askyl a, Finland. To quote a recent in-
ternational evaluation: \This is a very happy, col-
laborative and successful department with highly mo-
tivated and enthusiastic members of uniform high
quality." The postdoc will join a group led by
Dr. Mikael Puurtinen (Academy Research Fellow
2013-2017), which at the moment consists of the PI
and two PhD students. The applicant will also be-
come a member of the Centre of Excellence in Bi-
ological Interactions (https://www.jyu./bioenv/en/-
divisions/coe-interactions), which oers excellent net-
working possibilities among top scientists.
DEADLINE: To ensure full consideration, applications
should be received by December 15, 2012.
APPLICATION: In the application, include a state-128 EvolDir December 1, 2012

Postdoctoral Researcher, Evolution and Systematics of
Rust Fungi
We are seeking applications for a Post-Doctoral Re-
searcher to take the lead on molecular systematic in-
vestigations of rust fungi (Puccinia sp.) associated with
warm-season (C4) cereals and grasses that impact U.S.
agricultural productivity, including those that cause
disease in bioenergy grasses and major food crops. At
present, 141 dierent Puccinia species are thought to
cause disease in C4 grasses, with as many as 41 dierent
Puccinia species described from individual host genera.
Many of these rust-causing species are thought to in-
fect multiple hosts - up to eight dierent host genera in
some cases. However, current identications are almost
exclusively based on a few morphological traits and un-
likely to reect the true diversity of species present.
Basic responsibilities include the generation of molecu-
lar data for phylogeny reconstruction (including the de-130 EvolDir December 1, 2012
velopment of new markers) to determine evolutionary
relatedness, host range, co-evolution and distribution
of rust fungi on C4 grasses in the United States; mor-

The University of Sydney is Australia's rst university

of mathematics and statistics. The school attracts a
strong body of excellent students as well as Australian
Research Council (ARC) grants, fellowships, and other
competitive external funding.
Applications are sought for two Postdoctoral Research
Associate positions in the evolution and ecology of in-
vasive cane toads that are funded by an ARC Laureate
Fellowship \Using biological invasions to understand
evolutionary processes" held by Richard Shine.
The project exploits the unique logistical opportuni-
ties oered by the cane toad's Australian invasion to
pose and test a suite of hypotheses about evolutionary-
ecological processes. In particular, why has the rate
of dispersal of invasion-front toads increased so rapidly
over this relatively brief period? What are the relative
roles of spatial sorting and natural selection in driving
that range-edge acceleration? How and why do cane
toads at the invasion front dier from those in long-
colonised areas in traits such as cognitive ability, be-
havioural syndromes, dispersal tactics, immunobiology,
locomotor ability, morphology and phenotypic plastic-
ity? The project not only will compare such traits be-
tween toads from invasion-front versus long-colonized
areas, but also link those changes to concurrent research
on the genetic divergences that have accumulated dur-
ing the toads' Australian invasion.
This is an opportunity to conduct research in a highly
productive research team, on a project that has gath-
ered substantial international recognition. You will
spend most of your time working out of the University's
Tropical Ecology Research Facility at Middle Point, in
a bushland setting 65km east of the city of Darwin in
the Northern Territory. The eld station has accommo-
dation, oce and laboratory facilities, and four-wheel-
drive vehicles. However, the research also will require
extensive travel in order to collect toads from across
the breadth of the Australian tropics. Teaching is not
a requirement.
You will have: . PhD degree in biology (or be close
to completing one) . sound knowledge of advanced
techniques and demonstrated capability of research in
at least one of the following areas: analyses of mor-
phology, physiology, performance, behaviour, genetics
and/or ecology of free-ranging animals . demonstrated
ability to conduct high-quality research either indepen-
dently or as part of a research team, published research
as sole author or in collaboration, excellent written and
verbal communication skills.
Experience in conducting eldwork in remote areas, and
in working with multidisciplinary teams, will be highly

years subject to completion of a satisfactory probation
and conrmation period for new appointees. Further

tions such as the genes underlying the process of speci-
ation, the character of genomic divergence during spe-
ciation, and speciation-with-gene-ow. Flycatchers ofthe genus Ficedula oer an excellent model system for
studies of these and related questions (see e.g. Nature
387:589-592, 411:45-50, Science 318:95-97). We have re-
cently sequenced and de novo assembled the ycatcher
genome (at 85x coverage and with a scaold N50 of 7.3
Mb) and performed genome-wide re-sequencing of mul-
tiple individuals (each at 5x coverage) of the two closely
related species, collared ycatcher and pied ycatcher
(Nature, in press; doi:10.1038/nature11584). By this
we have identied a number of 'divergence islands',
many of which are associated with centromeres and
telomeres, potentially indicating a role for meiotic drive
in species divergence. We are now seeking new postdocs
to join t his long-term project in which coming research
will use data from whole-genome re-sequencing of mul-
tiple populations (sympatric as well as allopatric) and
species, from a 50K SNP array (genotyping in pedi-
grees and population samples) and from the ycatcher
transcriptome and methylome. Genomic parameters
that will be analyzed include, for example, recombi-
nation rates, linkage disequilibrium, expression diver-
gence, and epigenetic modication. Successful candi-
dates will have the possibility to choose among sev-
eral possible directions of research, in dialogue with the
host.
The venue for these positions, the Evolutionary Biology
Centre, is situated in recently-built localities in cen-
tral Uppsala. The working atmosphere is international
with a regular recruitment of PhD students and post-
docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes an exciting
arena for multidisciplinary research in evolutionary bi-
ology in a broad sense, housing some 300 scientists and
graduate students, and with research programs in, for
example, ecology, genetics, genomics and developmen-
tal biology. The scientic environment with numerous
seminars, journal clubs and social activities oer ex-
cellent possibilities for contacts and collaborations. A
graduate school in 'The Genomics of Phenotypic Diver-
sity in Natural Populations' (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
education/postgrad/gradschool/) provides a frame-
work for courses and other activities for PhD students.
Local platforms for next-generation sequencing (http:/-
/www.scilifelab.uu.se) and high-performance computa-
tional analyses (http://ww w.uppmax.uu.se) ensure
immediate access to state-of-the-art technology. Up-
psala University is the oldest university in Scandinavia
and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with
beautiful and easy accessible surroundings conveniently
situated close to Stockholm.
The positions, which are funded by a European Re-
search Council Advanced Investigator Grant, are ali-
ated with the Department of Evolutionary Biology - an
overview of the research activities in the environment134 EvolDir December 1, 2012
can be found at our web pages (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-

WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGENETICS
at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, California
March 2V9, 2013
Sponsored by the University of California, Davis and
Bodega Marine Laboratory (additional nancial sup-
port provided by the University of Rochester)
http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Front Page Intro-
duction Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized
modern systematics and become indispensable tools
in evolution, ecology and comparative biology, playing
an increasingly important role in analyses of biological
data at levels of organization ranging from molecules
to ecological communities. The estimation of phyloge-
netic trees is now a formalized statistical problem with
general agreement on the central issues and questions.
A nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
This Spring, for the fourteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-
vances in phylogenetic methodology, and then focuses
on methods and tools that can be brought to bear on
these \applied" issues in the context of a given phy-
logeny.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the Northern California coast, which has on-site
housing. Our newly increased bandwidth and access
to computing clusters allows us to utilize computer-
intensive approaches even in a one-week course. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, dis-
cussion, and hands-on software training. One afternoon
during the week will be left free for eld trips to local
natural areas.
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesian
and Maximum-likelihood estimation of phylogeny * Es-
timation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree con-icts * Divergence-time estimation from sequence data:
relaxed clocks, fossil calibration * Analysis of charac-
ter evolution: maximum likelihood and Bayesian ap-
proaches, ancestral-state estimation, rates of trait evo-
lution * Analysis of morphological form, function of
complex character systems * Inference of diversica-
tion rates: detecting rate shifts, testing key innovation
hypotheses * Model specication issues: model selec-
tion, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing MCMC

candidates who are in the early to middle stages of their
thesis research, and who have completed sucient pre-
requisites (through previous coursework or research ex-

ber 10th - 14th 2012
Candidates with adequate prole will be accepted in
the next 72 hours after the application until we reach
20 participants.
Overview
The course sets out to introduce an extensive range
of computing facilities vital for molecular biological re-
search. This will be achieved primarily through \hands
on" exercises based around an investigation of a well
documented human disease. How information can be
obtained both by analysis of raw sequence data and by
interrogation of information resources will be demon-
strated. In order to enable the participants to perform
sequence analysis on short read sequences, we will pro-
vide a short tutorial on NGS data analysis for begin-
ners.
Objectives
The course is a user course. How to use the various
tools is thus the prime objective. However, where it is
useful, the operation of the programs will be discussed
as far as is required. Participants will know how to set
up the programs in an informed fashion, and to fully un-
derstand the output generated. On completion of this
5 day long training, they will also know how to imple-
ment this methodology elsehwere, using public domain
software and data resources.
The course will provide participants with an awarenessof a wide range of bioinformatics tools and sucient
experience to use those tools in basic investigations.
Target Audience
This course is intended for those wishing to investigate
how they might begin to exploit the ever expanding
abundance of computing resources for molecular biolo-
gists. Course Pre-requisites
Basic understanding of molecular biology and no par-
ticular computing expertise will be assumed.

With Lisete Sousa and Carina Silva-Fortes
We are proud to annouce the third edition of our Foun-
dations course in BioStatistics.
Led by the rm hand of two Statisticians that have their
research work centered in the Life Sciences, participants
go through a comprehensive set of short lectures and
guided hands-on exercises. The course revisits concepts
bottom-up from probability to classication, using an
exclusive set of bioinformatics examples. It is a ve day
opportunity to put statistics back in shape, to acquire
condence in methods and to learn how to write small
scripts using open source software (R).
*Course description:*
This is one of our \Foundations" type courses, provid-
ing a systematic and detailed review of fundamental
concepts and techniques used in Bioinformatics. Many
analytical and inferential methods, regardless of their
novelty, have their niches of application all over the
place in Bioinformatics. Newer techniques such as the
ones employed in high throughput data analysis are not
dierent in this respect. We will be looking at statisti-
cal methods, digging into their inner workings, wearing
the skins of professional statisticians. Attendees can
expect to attend a thorough set of lectures that will
reveal the conceptual frameworks that are needed to
understand the methods, and extensive hands-on prac-
tice, exclusively based on biological examples.140 EvolDir December 1, 2012
*Target Audience* Everybody using Bioinformatics
methods is implicitly using statistical methods. Most
people have had one or more semester courses in Statis-
tics in their graduate education. For many, Statistics
happened in their lives a long a time ago, and that
makes it dicult to go back and manipulate the con-
cepts with full condence. Moreover, proper judgement
of the results often calls for a deeper level of under-
standing than what is required to solve scholarly exer-
cises.
Attending this course is a chance of revisiting subjects
like experimental design, hypothesis testing, inference
and prediction in an intensive and systematic way. We
will look into particular areas such as Bayesian Infer-
ence, Hidden Markov Chains and Multivariate methods
with the attitude, eyes and brains of a statistician that

Overview
Genetic data are increasingly used by ecologists and
evolutionary biologists in general. It has thus become
important for many biologists with dierent levels of ex-
perience to produce and analyse genetic data. In this
short course we shall try to take a practical approach
to the analysis of genetic data, but we will also provide
some of the theoretical background required to under-stand the outputs of the software used. This course
will be organised so as to mix sessions where impor-
tant notions are introduced with practicals where freely
available software will be used. While this will not be
the focus of the course, we will also discuss genealogical
(coalescent-based) simulation methods and those based
on forward-in-time simulations. Altogether this will al-
low to discuss the potentialities and limitations of the
tools available to the community.
In this three-day course we will introduce the main con-
cepts that underlie many of the population structured
models that are frequently used in population genetics.
We will focus on the importance of demographic history
(e.g. eective sizes and migration patterns) in shaping
genetic data. We will go through the basic notions that
are central to population genetics, insisting particularly
on the statistics used to measure genetic diversity and
population dierentiation. The course will also cover
a short introduction to coalescent theory, Bayesian in-
ference in population genetics and data simulation, as
they are connected to what makes landscape genetics
today on the basis of multilocus data.
Most theory will be put into practice in practical ses-
sions, analyzing real and/or simulated datasets. In
these sessions, we will
(i) look at measures of genetic diversity and dieren-
tiation using GENETIX; (ii) use methods to detect
population structure as implemented in the programs
GENECLASS2 and STRUCTURE; (iii) use geneland
to detect genetic clusters using spatial information on
the sampling locations of individuals, and (iv) learn
how to perform coalescent simulations of genetic data
(using SPAms and ms).

*University of Copenhagen Graduate Course: Tropical
Behavioural Ecology and Evolution in Panama*
* *
*Course summary: *
The course will provide an overview of the patterns and
processes that determine tropical biodiversity and of
the evolutionary ecology of key invertebrate model sys-
tems. The program is designed for graduate students at
all levels and includes a three week preparation phase in
Copenhagen (online for graduate students elsewhere),
where students will prepare and discuss literature, and
a personal eld project proposal (in the STRI short-
term fellowship format) with instructors to ensure sci-
entic interest and feasibility. Once in Panama (May
2013), students will focus on personal research projects
which will be supervised by the instructors to max-
imize the probability of obtaining publishable results.
A small group project designed by course instructors or
STRI scientists will expose students to specic research
techniques and study organisms as well as promote col-
laborative research. Students will read, review, and dis-
cuss the work of their peers, attend lectures/tutorials
and excursions throughout the stay in Panama. A nal
report in manuscript form will be submitted 16 days
after the eld component in Panama (June 12th). Stu-
dents will have the opportunity to interact with STRI
researchers and become familiar with infrastructural as-
pects of tropical research in behavioural ecology and
evolution at the world renowned Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute.
*Registration period: *Nov. 1st -March 8th
Space is limited to 16 Ph.D. and M.Sc. students there-
fore an application procedure is necessary. Personal
motivation and submission of the required permit pa-
perwork will be part of the admission criteria in case
the course becomes oversubscribed. General observa-
tion permits are provided but Ph.D. students are en-
couraged to apply for personal permits before Jan. 1st
to allow collection and exportation of specimens rele-
vant for vouchering and research.
*Course dates: *
* *April 6th-29th (online preparation and proposalwriting)
May 2nd to 27th (eld course in Gamboa, Panama)
June 12th (nal paper due, oral exams for M.Sc. stu-
dents enrolled at the University of Copenhagen will take
place June 21st in Denmark)
* *
*Fees: *
* *This 15 ECTS course is subsidized by the Centre
for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen
(*http://socialevolution.ku.dk/*) but will still carry a
fee of Dkr 9000 (1200 or $1485) for the 26 day eld
component in Panama. Expenses for transportation in
Panama (trucks, boats and charter buses), accommo-
dations, and meals will be covered but students will
arrange to pay their ights and personal research per-
mits. Small stipends may be awarded to qualied Pana-
manian students.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
