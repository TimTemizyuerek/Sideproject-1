IST Austria HumanEvolution May7
Announcing the launch of the ﬁrst IST Austria Young
Scientist Symposium on the topic of human evolution
on Monday May 7th 2012.
Human evolution is a topic that lends itself to a variety
of approaches, such as genetics, cognition, the evolu-6 EvolDir February 1, 2012
tion of language and palaeontology, including extensive
informatic applications. With this symposium we aim
to bring together people from diverse academic back-
grounds and give participants the opportunity to hear
about research that they would perhaps not normally
experience.
We are pleased to announce the following conﬁrmed
speakers: Bence Viola (MPI Leipzig, DE) Bill Sell-
ers (Manchester, UK) E¨ ors Szathm´ ary (Budapest,
HU) Daniel Nettle (Newcastle, UK) Johannes Krause
(T¨ ubingen, DE) Gil McVean (Oxford, UK)
This one-day event is organised by the students and
postdocs of IST Austria, and will take place on the IST
Austria 18km North of Vienna. Registration is free and
includes lunch, and a shuttle bus will be provided too
and from Vienna free of charge. There will also be an
opportunity for a campus tour if you wish to take a
look at the rest of what goes on at IST Austria
We are especially keen to give scientists at the start of
their career the opportunity to interact with top scien-
tists, and as the day will also include a question and
answer session with the speakers at the end of the day
on the future of human evolution, so that students can
pitch their questions directly to the experts. Students
are especially encouraged to register!

conference ﬁeld trips
A keynote lecture will be given by the Alfred Russel
Wallace Award winner, recognizing a lifetime of out-
standing contributions to biogeography.On the day just before and after the conference (9th
and 13th January), there will be arranged ﬁeld excur-
sions to a number of protected natural areas including
Everglades National Park. In addition, on 9 January,
several workshops will be held (topics currently in de-
velopment).

InﬂuentialSymbionts
Dear Evoldir Community
Wolfgang Miller and I (David Hughes) are convinced
that symbionts generally thought of as benign may play
an important role in altering host behavior. We are
all becoming more familiar with the increasing studies
on parasites adaptively controlling host behavior. It is
easy to see why they evolved and it will be fun to ﬁgure
out how they do it. But what of the many other selﬁsh
genetic elements from transposable elements to virus to
bacteria that cohabit in animal bodies. How much do
they impact behavior?
We think it is an interesting challenge to look for such
manipulators or therefore are organizing a symposium
at Ottawa entitled Inﬂuential symbionts: Master ma-
nipulators of adaptive host behavior
We have two slots left and since our whole symposia is
about ﬁnding things you didn’t really know you were
looking for we thought to again throw the net out to
catch someone. Are you working on any aspect of sym-
biosis (frankly that is everyone) that aﬀects behavior?
Please let us know if you are interested.10 EvolDir February 1, 2012

A strong connection between phenotypic evolution and
developmental mechanisms (gene regulation, protein in-
teractions, mechanical constrains) of rodents is increas-
ingly used to describe and explore the links between
micro- and macroevolution. The classical mouse model
is no longer the single best-suited model for explaining
the evolution and development of rodent phenotypes
(skulls, bones, teeth). Hence, the diversity of small
mammals used, both by paleontologists and develop-
mental biologists, is increasing: Cricetidae (Cricetus,
Microtus, Myodes), Muridae (Mus, Apodemus), Sorici-
dae (Sorex, Crocidura)... This symposium seeks to en-
able both paleontologists and biologists to share their
cutting-edge experience and knowledge of small mam-
mal evolution and development. We hope to increase
interactions between these two group of researchersthrough their combined interests in the fast evolving
rodents.

Dear Colleagues,
We would like to invite all non-tenured (post-grad - fel-
low) researchers currently working in the North of Eng-
land to a one-oﬀ symposium held at the Institute for
Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool. NEYEES
aims to bring together early career researchers working
in the Evolutionary Ecology ﬁeld in order to promote
the sharing of ideas and approaches between neighbour-
ing institutions.
The symposium will span 2 days, with a total of 20
talks. As a guideline, sessions will be divided up into 5
themes; Molecular Evolution, Symbiont Evolution, Sex
and Life Histories, Population Biology and Adaptation
to changing environments
These themes are guidelines however, and any talks not
ﬁtting into these subjects will not be disadvantaged.
Conﬁrmed speakers: Chris Wilson (Imperial College
London) Kayla King (University of Liverpool) Penny
Haddrill (University of Edinburgh)
All attendees are invited to submit an abstract, and reg-
istration and abstracts should be submitted by the 19th
February. To register and for more details, please visit
http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/ ˜ eharriso/ We have capped
attendance at 25 people to make sure that we maintain
an intimate atmosphere, so be sure to register early to
be sure there is space!

Project description:
Population genetics of key determinants of drought and
freezing stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Diﬀerent accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana from
around the world have been demonstrated to have very
diﬀerent levels of freezing and drought stress tolerance,
seemingly adapted to their local climate e.g. the Cape
Verde accession is very freezing-sensitive (Cook et al.,
2004; Hannah et al., 2006; Gery et al., 2011). Thus the
natural distribution of Arabidopsis thaliana may reﬂect
selective pressure for local adaptation with respect to
environmental stress, which should be revealed at the
genetic level.
There are already full genome sequences for almost
500 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, this num-
ber is planned to increase to 1000 in the next year
(www.1001genomes.org ). This resource is freely avail-
able, allowing the in silico mining for candidate genes
and SNPs to screen in comparison with neutral loci.
Loci in accessions not already sequenced will be am-
pliﬁed, cloned and sequenced. For instance for freez-
ing stress, key candidates would include the CBF tran-
scription factors (McKhann et al., 2008) (shown to be
the reason for altered freezing tolerance of Cape Verde
accession (Cook et al., 2004)), and for drought the
DREB2 and ABF transcription factors, shown in nu-
merous laboratory studies to be key determinants of
drought stress tolerance (Kim, 2006; Qin et al., 2007;
Qin et al., 2008).
Patterns of population structure at functional loci can
be expected to be associated with strength of selection
and inﬂuence of genetic drift (which will be related to
the eﬀective population size and pattern and extent of
population connectivity).
This study will compare population genetic structure
at neutral and candidate functional loci for natural
Arabidopsis thaliana populations across relevant envi-
ronmental gradients (from the Arctic to the equator).
Signals for selection will be assessed comparing the re-
lationship between population diﬀerentiation and di-
versity under neutral expectations. Initial studies will
be based on assessment of allele frequency, followed byanalysis of expression by real-time PCR analysis. Alle-
les from diﬀerent accessions will be transferred by ge-
netic transformation to validate the inﬂuence of speciﬁc
alleles in diﬀerent genetic backgrounds.
Key objectives will include a better understanding of
the strength of selection for speciﬁc candidate gene sys-
tems related to environmental stress, and the relative
importance of drift and selection in diﬀerent environ-
mental contexts. The project will also seek to deter-
mine the relative importance of each genetic determi-
nant of freezing and drought stress in the wild, evidence
for which currently only comes from controlled labora-
tory experiments using a limited number of accessions.

The focus of infectious disease research is most often
on just one organism, the pathogen. However, when
pathogens encounter a host, they do not meet a ster-
ile environment but a pre-existing and complex multi-
species microbial community that either allows, facili-
tates or outcompetes the newcomer and consequently
determines clinical outcome. in this inter-disciplinary
project, we will combine the approaches of evolution-

immunocompromise produce. The aim is to identify
key factors permitting pathogen colonization and in-

The Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research (GEOMAR)
seeks to recruit a PhD student in Evolutionary Biology.
The PhD student will be funded by a German science
foundation (DFG) grant, entitled “/Interactive eﬀects
of environmental change and host-parasite co-evolution
on the ecological speciation of sticklebacks/”.
The project:
We aim at testing experimentally the relative contri-bution of natural and sexual selection on the process
of ecological speciation using the three-spined stickle-
back as model organism. Both abiotic (eutrophication)
and biotic (parasitism) pressures will be manipulated in
large scale mesocosm experiments and ecological (mate
choice) and genomic/transcriptomic changes will be fol-
lowed over generations.
The project is part of the Lead Agency Program
and will be performed in strong collaboration with
Dr. Blake Matthews’ lab (EAWAG, Kastanienbaum,
Switzerland).
The candidates should:
- Be highly motivated.
- Have a master degree (or equivalent) in Evolutionary
biology, Animal biology, Genetics or any related ﬁelds.
- Be interested in host-parasite coevolution, evolution
of mating strategies, speciation, genomics and evolu-
tionary consequences of climate change.
The hosting lab:
The GEOMAR is an international research institute
aﬃliated to the University of Kiel (Germany). The
working language of the department is English. The
successful student will join the junior research group
of Dr. Christophe Eizaguirre, which is part of a larger
department led by Prof. Thorsten Reusch.
The research activities in the department are diverse
and include host-parasite interactions, conservation ge-
netics, ﬁshery and ﬁshery induced evolution.

Project summary:
How human-caused environmental change aﬀects the
ecological and evolutionary processes that create and
maintain biodiversity is a pressing question in biol-
ogy. The eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is a
widespread and ongoing problem that has manifold con-
sequences for sustaining critical ecosystem services, in-
cluding water quality and biodiversity. The loading of
nutrients (e.g. phosphorus and nitrogen) to freshwater
environments not only aﬀects their chemical and phys-
ical condition, but also inﬂuences the nature of interac-
tions between species such as host-parasite interactions
which generate local adaptation patterns and may even
lead to speciation. Pervasive eﬀects of eutrophication
can alter selection regimes and therefore, cause unex-
pected evolutionary changes in populations over short
time scales. Here, using three-spined stickleback as a
model system, we focus on how the interactive eﬀects
of nutrient loading and parasites might drive rapid evo-
lutionary changes and breakdown of local adaptation.
First, using an intensive ﬁeld survey along a lake pro-
ductivity gradient, we will test how lake productivity
co-varies with i) parasite diversity and community com-
position, ii) host genotype diversity, and iii) host im-
mune system function and gene expression- testing for
local adaptation of host and parasite populations. Sec-
ond, using a large scale experiment in mesocosms (42
X 1000 L), we will test how contrasting natural selec-
tion regimes, resulting from orthogonal combinations
of parasites and nutrient levels, can aﬀect phenotyp-
ically and genotypically stickleback adaptive abilities.
In this experiment, we focus on phenotypic and genetic
traits that have been implicated in mate selection, so
that we can test if the contrasting selection regimes
caused by manipulating nutrients and parasites (antag-
onistically) synergistically might contribute to popula-
tion divergence, and play a role in (reverse) speciation.
This work will shed light on how natural and sexual
selection are mediated by parasites and environmental
conditions, and

Description
The successful applicant will use carefully designed ex-
periments and social network theory to understand
and predict the responses and adaptations of gregar-
ious freshwater ﬁsh and amphibians to human-induced
environmental change. The studentship asks how
these changes inﬂuence association/contact patterns
and mixing in social networks, and consequently trans-
mission of information and diseases within micro- and
macro-populations. We hypothesise that changes in the
environment will indirectly aﬀect network structures,
but the consequences of this are diﬃcult to predict.
Changes could increase contact rates (e.g. increased co-
hesion), and so heighten disease and information trans-
mission. Conversely, changes could reduce contact rates
(e.g. reduced activity), dampening disease and infor-
mation transmission. Depending on the direction and
magnitude of these eﬀects, anthropogenic change could
therefore result in a net costs or beneﬁts to populations.
The successful applicant will beneﬁt from working
within a lively research environment within the Struc-
ture and Motion Laboratory and the Veterinary Epi-
demiology and Public Health Group at the Royal
Veterinary College Hawkshead Campus. The stu-
dent will acquire diverse research skills, including ﬁeld
and laboratory techniques and advanced data analy-
sis/statistical skills. The project will be supervised
principally by Dr Andrew King, an expert on the struc-
ture and function of animal societies. The project will
take an interdisciplinary approach and the student will
work closely with Prof Dirk Pfeiﬀer (RVC) with exper-
tise in analytical epidemiology, advanced multivariate
techniques, spatial and temporal analysis of epidemio-
logical data, Dr Ken Eames, a mathematical biologist
based in the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of In-
fectious Diseases (LSHTM) who is an expert on social
network analyses, and Dr Jon Bielby (Institute of Zo-
ology, ZSL) a conservation biologist whose expertise is
how life-history, ecology and threat intensity interact
to determine the susceptibility of a species.

PhD STUDENTSHIP IN SEXUAL SELECTION AND
EVOLUTION OF SPERM TRAITS AND FUNCTION
We oﬀer a four-year PhD studentship to study the role
of sexual selection on energy metabolism and oxidative
stress in mammalian spermatozoa.
The study will integrate diﬀerent levels: evolutionary
biology, reproductive physiology, cell biology and bio-
chemistry. The aim is to understand whether sperm
competition enhances sperm energy metabolism which,
in turn, generates oxidative stress in sperm.
The study involves intensive laboratory work to anal-

PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
A PhD position in evolutionary biology focusing on ef-
fective population sizes in vertebrates is available at the
Centre for Conservation Biology, Department of Biol-
ogy. The fellowship is ﬁnanced by an Advanced Re-
search Grant by the European Research Council to the
project Stochastic Population Biology in a Fluctuat-
ing Environment for three years with the possibility of
up to four years including teaching duties to the De-
partment of Biology. The position is within the NTNU
Evolution, Ethology and Ecology group (EEE): ( http:/-
/www.ntnu.no/biologi/eee )
The fellowship runs under the doctoral programme at
the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology. The
faculty is the employer, and working place is Depart-
ment of Biology. The Department of Biology has 36
members of faculty (professors and associate profes-
sors), 22 research scientists and about 66 PhD students
and post docs. The department has research programs

. Project background: Eﬀective population size is one
of the basic concepts for understanding evolutionary
dynamics at the molecular and phenotypic levels. The
eﬀective size of a population, Ne, determines the ex-
pected rate of random genetic drift, increase in inbreed-
ing coeﬃcients, and loss of selectively neutral heterozy-
gosity, each of which is proportional to 1/(2Ne) per
generation for a diploid autosomal locus. Furthermore,
Ne also interacts with selection to inﬂuence the ﬁxa-
tion probabilities of advantageous and deleterious mu-
tations. In real populations Ne generally is substan-
tially smaller than N, the actual population size, of-
ten by an order of magnitude, because of uneven sex-
ratio, large variance in family size (greater than the
mean), and temporal ﬂuctuations in population size.
Age structure eﬀects considerably complicate the calcu-
lation of eﬀective population size. Formulas for eﬀective
population size with overlapping generations have been
derived by several authors . However, for populations
exposed to natural environments, ﬂuctuating popula-
tion size is usually the most important factor reducing
Ne below the actual average size. All natural popu-
lations ﬂuctuate due to a combination of demographic
and environmental stochasticity, which generally pro-duce ﬂuctuations in both the age structure and total
size of a population. Thus, accounting for ﬂuctuations
in population size and age structure is essential for cal-
culating the eﬀective size of a population with over-
lapping generations. The candidate will work on these
problems using data from long-term study systems (e.g.
house sparrows and moose ) as well as being part of an
international network of collaborators who can provide
suitable data sets
Requirements: The position require a Master degree
or similar within evolutionary biology, ecology and/or
biomathematics. The applicant must be qualiﬁed for
the doctoral program within these disciplines. Back-
ground in population genetics, statistics and evolution-
ary biology will also be considered advantageous. We
are looking for a hard-working candidate, highly moti-
vated to conduct fundamental scientiﬁc research. Abil-
ity to carry out goal-oriented work, ability to deliver,
oral and written presentation of research results, and
good co-operation abilities will be emphasized.
In order to be accepted as a PhD student the grades of
the MSc degree has to be suﬃciently high (in Norway:
B/2.5, or better), or the applicant has to document
a similar level through later scientiﬁc work. Candi-
dates from universities outside Norway are requested
to send a Diploma Supplement or a similar document,

Description
The successful applicant will use carefully designed ex-
periments and social network theory to understand
and predict the responses and adaptations of gregar-
ious freshwater ﬁsh and amphibians to human-induced
environmental change. The studentship asks how
these changes inﬂuence association/contact patterns
and mixing in social networks, and consequently trans-
mission of information and diseases within micro- and
macro-populations. We hypothesise that changes in the
environment will indirectly aﬀect network structures,
but the consequences of this are diﬃcult to predict.
Changes could increase contact rates (e.g. increased co-
hesion), and so heighten disease and information trans-
mission. Conversely, changes could reduce contact rates
(e.g. reduced activity), dampening disease and infor-
mation transmission. Depending on the direction and
magnitude of these eﬀects, anthropogenic change could
therefore result in a net costs or beneﬁts to populations.
The successful applicant will beneﬁt from working
within a lively research environment within the Struc-
ture and Motion Laboratory and the Veterinary Epi-
demiology and Public Health Group at the Royal
Veterinary College Hawkshead Campus. The stu-
dent will acquire diverse research skills, including ﬁeld
and laboratory techniques and advanced data analy-
sis/statistical skills. The project will be supervised
principally by Dr Andrew King, an expert on the struc-
ture and function of animal societies. The project will
take an interdisciplinary approach and the student will
work closely with Prof Dirk Pfeiﬀer (RVC) with exper-
tise in analytical epidemiology, advanced multivariate
techniques, spatial and temporal analysis of epidemio-
logical data, Dr Ken Eames, a mathematical biologist
based in the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of In-
fectious Diseases (LSHTM) who is an expert on social
network analyses, and Dr Jon Bielby (Institute of Zo-
ology, ZSL) a conservation biologist whose expertise is
how life-history, ecology and threat intensity interact
to determine the susceptibility of a species.

*Brief summary of the project:*
This project merges genomic, evolutionary and ecologi-
cal approaches, having an emphasis on amphibian pop-
ulations in montane habitats. The model species are
the common frog - Rana temporaria and common toad
- Bufo bufo), which are very sensitive to rapid warm-
ing and vulnerable to the occurrence of novel pathogens
(i.e. Ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis).
The general aim is at establishing a research program
to characterize biodiversity at the intraspeciﬁc level.
Multiple angles will be tackled (i.e. quantitative ge-
netic breeding designs, population genetics, 454 tran-
scriptome sequencing and comparative linkage/QTL-
mapping), aiming at providing molecular tools to track
adaptation to thermal conditions and strong disease-
induced selection in the wild.
The identiﬁcation and monitoring of adaptive genetic
polymorphisms with respect to environmental condi-
tions will be used in the assessment of conservation
value and capacity to adapt to climate change in wild
populations.

Open PhD position in Evolutionary Biology of Alpine
Plants
A PhD postion is available in the Group of Plant Pop-

of Basel in a research project with the title: “How lo-
cal adaptation and phenotypic plasticity allow plants
to survive in a changing Alpine landscape: Eﬀects of
ﬁne-grained vs. coarse-grained environmental variabil-
ity”.
The project is a continuation of earlier research in
my lab and includes reciprocal transplantation among
ﬁeld sites, controlled experiments in the greenhouse and
molecular work. I will contribute to a still poorly un-
derstood question of evolutionary biology: To what ex-
tend is local adaptation of alpine plants shaped by phe-
notypic plasticity and to what extend is it a result of
ﬁxed genotypic diﬀerences?
Genotypic variability and phenotypic plasticity are
complementary mechanisms adjusting plants to envi-
ronmental heterogenity. Phenotypic plasticity received
increased attention because of its possible role for the
colonization of new habitats or to mitigate climate
change. There is a shortage of studies testing the role of
phenotypic plasticity in the ﬁeld. The main hypothe-
ses to be tested in this project is, that natural selec-
tion by ﬁne-grained environmental variability should
have favored high phenotypic plasticity, while coarse-
grained environmental variability should have favored
ﬁxed genotypic variability.February 1, 2012 EvolDir 27
The successful candidate should be motivated to work
on alpine evolutionary ecology. Applicants with expe-
riences in experimental population biology and a sound
background in statistics will be preferred, and skills or
interest in molecular work would be appreciated. Appli-
cants should enjoy working in the ﬁeld as well as in the

Divergence in life history along ecological gradients
in Australian rainforest Drosophilia: how does early
growth aﬀect longevity and immunity?
Supervisors: Dr Jon Bridle (University of Bristol) and
Dr Nick Priest (University of Bath)
Evolution is a multiple optimisation problem: selection
to optimise one trait typically has negative eﬀects on
others. Classical trade-oﬀs include egg size and number,
development rate and competitiveness, and fecundity
and longevity but we lack empirical data on how con-
sistent these correlations are across populations of the
same species. Quantifying correlations between ﬁtness
traits, especially where they act diﬀerently on diﬀerent
life stages or genders, is critical to understand longevityand health in natural populations.
This studentship will explore how insect life histories
are shaped by local selection. We are currently test-
ing adaptive divergence in Australian Drosophila birchii
along four 2-10 km ecological gradients, and are mea-
suring 400+ isofemale lines from diﬀerent altitudes for
stress resistance, female fecundity and male mating suc-
cess. These lines show remarkable increases in labora-
tory productivity at higher altitudes, implying strong
trade-oﬀs in the ﬁeld. The student will examine how
these traits aﬀect the rate of ageing and the ability
to resist fungal infections. Previous analyses of such
Drosophila traits have revealed consistent associations
between immunity, behaviour, longevity, and tempera-
ture.
We are looking for a highly-motivated student with a
passion for evolutionary biology and genetics. (S)he
will receive training in life history evolution theory,
quantitative genetics, and modern molecular tech-
niques, and will measure genetic variation in life history
traits in Drosophila, and (most crucially) how these cor-
relations vary among sites. In addition, (s)he will as-
say genome-wide linkage disequilibria in SNPs, allowing
exploration of the genomic basis for these trait correla-
tions.
This a competitively-funded studentship; funding will
only be awarded to those research projects that attract
the brightest and most enthusiastic candidates.

Discovering candidate sex determining genes in a reptile
with genetic and temperature dependent sex determi-
nation
We are seeking potentially TWO FULLY FUNDED
PhD students with interests in genomics, genetics and
reproduction, molecular cytogenetics and evolution to
carry out targeted and intensive molecular and func-
tional characterisation of candidate sex determining
genes in a model reptile species.
Project Description Sex determination in vertebrates
is the focus of vigorous enquiry, because of its intrin-
sic interest as a crucial fundamental biological process.
Yet, despite decades of work, we know remarkably lit-
tle, in vertebrates generally, of the processes that direct
sexual development down one or the other of the male
or female development pathways, and sex determining
genes have been identiﬁed in only a handful of verte-
brate species. Non-mammalian systems are much less
well understood, partly because they have received less
attention, but also because of their astonishing diver-
sity. Reptiles, in particular have a truly impressive ar-
ray of sex-determining modes, compared with the con-
servatism of mammals and birds. Among reptiles with
genotypic sex determination (GSD), male and female
heterogamety (XY and ZW) is known in turtles, fe-
male heterogamety (ZW, ZZW, or ZWW) is known in
snakes and both male and female heterogamety (includ-
ing XXY) are known in lizards.
The aim of this project is to carry out targeted and
intensive molecular and functional characterisations of
candidate sex determining genes in the model reptile,
the central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) in order
to identify key sex determining genes in this species and
to use this information to dissect evolutionary mecha-
nisms initiating sex chromosome diﬀerentiation within

PhD Studentship at the University of Exeter, UK.
Modelling early eukaryotic evolution using biogeochem-
ical data ? a systems approach.
Supervisors: Dr. Mark van der Giezen (Biosciences) &
Prof. Tim Lenton (Geography).
It is commonly assumed that the ancestor of all eu-
karyotes was aerobic and acquired a mitochondrion
when oxygen ﬁrst rose to signiﬁcant levels in the atmo-
sphere. However, although atmospheric oxygen concen-
tration rose in a ?Great Oxidation? of the atmosphere
around 2.4 billion years ago, it only reached 1-10% of
the present level, and the deep oceans remained largely
anoxic and either iron-enriched or sulphidic until 580
million years ago, when the eukaryotic radiation was
well underway. This new picture could explain the
widespread distribution of anaerobic biochemistry in
every eukaryotic supergroup.
This project will provide training in handling large-
scale datasets of various strategically-chosen anaerobic
eukaryotic taxa. We have the genomes of several key
organisms and proven collaborations to provide access
to other key genomes which have been published, or are
soon to be submitted to high impact journals. Train-
ing will also be provided to use the Proterozoic Earth
system model to explore the chemical composition of
the ancient ocean, with particular emphasis on avail-
ability of diﬀerent trace metals. This will be matched
to the anaerobic biochemical potential of representative
genomes, to arrive at a novel synthesis of these inter-
disciplinary ﬁelds.
Lenton is an expert in the coupled evolution of life and
the planet and has recently developed an Earth sys-
tem model of the Proterozoic Eon in which eukaryotes
evolved. This model includes a 3-dimensional ocean
with sediments and many geochemical tracers that canbe matched to data recorded in ancient rocks to recon-
struct the environments in which eukaryotes evolved.
Van der Giezen is an expert in anaerobic eukaryote
biochemistry and evolution and has recently reviewed
energy metabolism in anaerobic eukaryotes. This is a
good time to combine our expertise on the interplay be-
tween anaerobic environments and eukaryotes through
a crucial interval of Earth history. We envisage several
good quality publications, given that ancient ocean re-
dox chemistry and anaerobic eukaryotic biochemistry
have both been the subject of a string of high impact
papers over the last ten years or so and we have been
involved in several of these.
About the award We are inviting applications to com-
mence October 2012. For eligible students the awards
will cover UK/EU tuition fees and an annual stipend
(in 2011/12 this was ?13,590 for full-time students, pro
rata for part-time students) for at least three years.
Entry requirements Applicants for these studentships
must have obtained, or be about to obtain, a First or
Upper Second Class UK Honours degree, or the equiv-
alent qualiﬁcations gained outside the UK, in a rele-
vant subject. The studentships are only available to
UK and other EU nationals (due to funding criteria,
EU nationals who have not been resident in the UK for
the three years prior to the start of their studentship
may be restricted to a fees-only award). The awards
provide funding for tuition fees and stipend, subject to
eligibility.

Supervisors: Dr. Mark van der Giezen & Dr. David J.
Studholme.
We identiﬁed a unique and novel mechanism that can be
exploited to tackle major plant pathogens such as Phy-
tophthora. This proposal addresses the BBSRC Food
Security strategic priority and will provide combined
training in bioinformatics and biochemistry/cell biol-
ogy.
The aims are: - Identify the novel stramenopile-speciﬁc
mitochondrial transport protein by comparative ge-
nomics. - Interfere with this glycolytic transporter us-
ing substrate-analogs.
We have demonstrated that in a large group of or-
ganisms, which includes major plant pathogens suchFebruary 1, 2012 EvolDir 31
as Phytophthora and the human parasite Blastocystis,
the second half of glycolysis is localized in mitochondria
rather than the cytoplasm.
Mitochondrial localization of the latter half of glycoly-
sis necessitates a novel transporter. As several genomes
of related organisms are available, and both supervi-
sors have produced additional related human and plant
pathogen genomes (for example the Gatsby/FERA-

PhD Studenthsip on the Molecular Basis and Evolution
of Host-Pathogen Interaction.
This studentship provides an exciting opportunity to
involve in research towards better understanding the
evolution and molecular basis of host-parasite interac-
tions. Based in the Soyer group, the successful candi-
date will undertake experimental and theoretical work
in collaboration with the lab of Prof. Richard Titball
and the research team at DSTL.
In recent years parasite interference with host pathways
has emerged as a key mechanism that ensures parasites
ability to infect and reproduce in the host cell. Doc-
umented examples of parasite interference come from
a variety of pathogens including Taxoplasma, Leishma-
nia, Yersinia, and Francisella tularensis and also viruses
such as herpes and HIV. In this project, we will fo-
cus on the genomic and experimental idenﬁtifaction of
pathogen interference points in the host networks and
theoretical system dynamics analysis of the correspond-
ing host sub-networks.

Join a team that examines the mechanisms of speciation
using Hawaiian Metrosideros, an endemic tree species
complex that appears to capture multiple stages of the
speciation process. Our studies involve ﬁeld, green-
house, and lab (molecular and microscopy) methods to
examine the strengths and stages of reproductive iso-
lation among taxa, adaptive divergence among taxa,
and the molecular genetic changes that accompany di-
vergence. The graduate scholar will receive training in
ﬁeld and lab methods and will contribute to the overall
project, while also conducting thesis research.
The successful applicant(s) will receive $22,000 annual
salary, will enroll in the TCBES Program in August
2012, and will join a vibrant research community in

ment of Biological Sciences ( http://biology.unt.edu/ ).
We are interested in strong applicants with a back-
ground in biological sciences, broadly interested in the
comparative and evolutionary physiology of animals.
Potential graduate students interested in vertebratecomparative physiology, with an emphasis on studies
of lower vertebrates (ﬁsh, amphibians and reptiles), as
well as birds and mammals are encouraged to apply.
Experience using molecular methods is desired. We
strongly encourage applications from students that
hold a M.S. in a ﬁeld of biology. Accepted students
will have access to our colony of hatchling alligators
and turtles (hatched Aug-Sept 2011) produced from
eggs incubated under chronic hypoxia or hypercapnia
conditions. In addition students will have access
to a large frozen turtle and alligator tissue library
including heart, lung, liver and kidney from diﬀerent
embryonic timepoints with both to chronic hypoxia
or hypercapnia as the experimental manipulation.
All members of the lab are encouraged to use these
animals and tissues as experimental subjects.
MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES We are particularly in-
terested in applicants who are familiar with the molec-
ular methodologies used to quantify gene and protein
expression for cardiovascular and regulatory compo-
nents (receptors and enzymes) during vertebrate de-
velopment. Useful techniques that a strongly quali-
ﬁed applicant would posses are, mRNA quantiﬁcation,
Western blot analysis, 2D gel electrophoresis, real time
PCR, receptor binding assays, or in situ hybridization.
A background in comparative, evolutionary, develop-
mental or reptilian biology is a plus, but is not nec-
essary. We have compiled a large, ﬂash-frozen library
(-80C) of tissues from various embryonic timepoints for
turtles and alligators exposed to chronic hypoxia or hy-
percapnia as embryos, including heart, lung, liver and
kidney tissues. Therefore, students could be able to

UppsalaU Sexually Antagonistic
Variation
Uppsala University hereby invites applications for a
Postgraduate PhD position in Animal Ecology - sexu-
ally antagonistic genetic variation
at the Department of Ecology and Genetics, Evolu-
tionary Biology Centre (EBC) with a tentative start-
ing date being May 1 ^st , 2012, or as soon as possi-
ble after this date. The Evolutionary Biology Center
hosts one of the world’s largest aggregations of evo-
lutionary biologists, and is a prime research environ-
ment for a wide range of ﬁelds in evolutionary biol-
ogy (see “ http://www.ebc.uu.se/” for more informa-
tion). The working atmosphere is very international
with English as our operational language. Our gradu-
ate school oﬀers a creative and stimulating environment
and is very rich in seminars, courses and possibilities to
interact with other scholars and students (see “ http:/-
/www.ebc.uu.se/education/” ) – graduate students re-
cently ranked Uppsala University in ﬁrst place among
all institutions in Europe in the subject of biology (CHE
European ranking). Uppsala University is the oldest
university in Scandinavia and the city of Uppsala is a
vibrant student town with beautiful surroundings con-
veniently situated 35 minutes by train from Stockholm.
*Brief research outline: **Although males and females
share much of the same genome, selection can be dis-
tinct in the two sexes. Sexually antagonistic loci are
those loci where selection acts in opposing directions
in the two sexes. This PhD student position is aimed
at improving our emerging understanding of the **ar-
chitecture of sexually antagonistic genetic variation**.
Insects (seed beetles and/or fruit ﬂies) will serve as
main model systems and the research will primarily
employ quantitative genetic techniques. The research
will establish a series of discrete genotypes and use
crosses between these to analyse, describe and under-
stand the architecture of sexually antagonistic genetic
variation. Traits in focus are sex speciﬁc measures of
life history traits (especially metabolism) and integra-
tive traits such as life-time ﬁtness. ***
*This PhD *position forms a part of a new project
on genetic conﬂict, funded by the European Research
Council and the Swedish Research Council. The en-
tire project will employ some 6-8 PhD students and
postdocs, apart from a full time TA and the PI, andwill strongly encourage interactions and collaborations
within the group.
*Salary and appointment*: The duration of the PhD
training period is four full years. The successful candi-
date will receive a postgraduate fellowship the ﬁrst year
(currently 15.500 SEK/month) and a postgraduate po-
sition year 2-4 (currently 23.300 – 26.400 SEK/month)
including full social beneﬁts.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate should have a rel-
evant MSc degree (or equivalent) in biology/ecology.
*Qualiﬁcations and merits*: We seek highly moti-
vated candidates with a documented and strong inter-
est in evolutionary biology and/or evolutionary genet-
ics, preferably also with past experience of quantitative
genetic analyses and an understanding of life history
theory and sexual selection. Experience of laboratory
work with insects is a merit as is previous experience of
scientiﬁc writing and publishing. Because the holder of
this position will collaborate and interact closely with
other members of the group, we will put emphasis on
both independence and ability to collaborate.The ap-
plicant is expected to have a good knowledge (spoken
and written) of the English language.
*To apply:*Applications should include (1) personal in-
formation/background, (2) complete CV (3) a descrip-
tion of undergraduate training, (4) an authorized copy
of the undergraduate degree and (5) the names and
email addresses of three referees. Applications should

ToxoplasmaPopulationGenomics
Disease Ecology: Parasitology
Diversity and pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii iso-
lates from Africa
A new PhD position is available to work on popula-
tion genomics of Toxoplasma in Prof Judith Smith’s lab
at the University of Salford, Manchester. Toxoplasma
gondii is one of the most common zoonotic pathogens
worldwide. The parasite can cause serious congenital
disease in humans and animals and is potentially fatal
to individuals with HIV. Prof. Smith’s research group
has recently isolated some of the ﬁrst parasite strains
from Africa revealing that they are closely related to
clonal strain types (II and III) which dominate across
Europe and North America and also discovering that
recombination between these strains occurs in nature.38 EvolDir February 1, 2012
They further generated whole genome sequence for our
recombinant isolate identifying over 74,000 Single Nu-
cleotide Polymorphisms.
This analysis allowed us map regions with high levels of
variation and loci under selection providing markers to
investigate the diversity of strains in relation to disease
phenotype. Based on these new tools we now wish to
investigate the frequency of recombination and its im-
pact on the disease virulence. The project will isolate
and characterise strains from rural and urban habitats
using genetic analysis to detect recombination and in
vitro culture to investigate the phenotype of strains.
For more information please visit Professor Smith’s re-
search page by following this link.
Funding Notes: Prof Smith has commissioned a Grade
2 pathogen laboratory for isolation and culture of par-
asite strains. This allows work on the molecular and
phenotypic characterization of pathogens. Support for
consumables and travel is also available. The researcher
would develop the project which builds on past research
experience working on the diversity and environmental
partitioning of parasites. The project area will fall into
the remit of NERC and will pump prime a grant appli-
cation in this area.
Closing date for applications: 17 Feb. 2012

partment of Computer Science
3 year studentship
Application closing date: Wednesday 25 January 2012.
The successful applicant(s) will investigate the applica-
tion of social evolution theory to understanding pro andanti-social behaviour in a biological system or systems
of their choice. Social systems span all ranges of biolog-
ical complexity, from populations of single-celled organ-
isms, to multi-cellular bodies, to societies of individuals.
Of particular interest for the lab is the importance of
social evolution theory for understanding many aspects
of disease. The successful applicants will be encouraged
to empirically study their chosen systems, either devel-
oping experiments themselves or in collaboration with
experimental biologists, while ensuring that any exper-
iments are motivated by and interpreted using a good
understanding of the underlying theory. A representa-
tive recent theoretical publication from the Lab in this
area is http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/-
pii/S0169534711001169 The ideal candidates will be
biologically-inclined physical scientists (e.g. with ﬁrst
degrees in mathematics, physics or computer science)
or numerate life scientists. Candidates should submit
an application as described below including in their ap-
plication a 500 word research proposal understandable
to a non-specialist, and a 250 word explanation of why
their skills, experience and plans for further research or
study make them a particularly suitable candidate.
Potential candidates are welcome to discuss their
application informally with Dr James Marshall
(james.marshall@shef.ac.uk).
The studentship will cover the candidates’ fees, as well
as a stipend at a level determined by the candidate’s
background. Applications from UK home, EU home
and international students are welcomed.
About the Behavioural and Evolutionary Theory Lab:
The Behavioural and Evolutionary Theory Lab is an
interdisciplinary collection of individuals interested in
how and why behaviours evolve. We are interested in
behaviours and behavioural mechanisms, and their evo-
lutionary function. We apply a range of theoretical
approaches, from mathematics and statistics, decision
theory, computer science, and physics. Particular top-
ics of interest are currently the evolution of social be-
haviour, such as altruism and cooperation, and optimal
decision-making mechanisms in groups, such as social
insects, and in individuals.
The Lab is part of the Department of Computer Sci-
ence, University of Sheﬃeld ( http://www.shef.ac.uk/-

PhD project available at the University of St Andrews:
evolutionary genomics of social behaviour and repro-
ductive isolation
We are seeking an enthusiastic PhD student to work
on a project using two closely-related Australian ﬁeld
cricket species (Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus
commodus) and next-generation sequencing to identify
inﬂuences of the social environment, behavioural mech-
anisms, and associated candidate genes that contribute
to reproductive isolation. The student will work to-
wards three goals: (1) test how variation in the social
environments of T. oceanicus and T. commodus aﬀects
the expression of behaviours that impede hybridisation
between the two species, (2) use genetic markers and
QTL crosses to map genomic regions implicated in re-
sponses to social information and (3) identify and char-
acterise candidate genes in those regions. The student
will develop bioinformatic techniques to integrate and
visualise the resulting network of genetic, mechanistic
and behavioural information. Existing laboratory pop-
ulations of both species and funding available for be-
havioural work and genetic mapping make the project
feasible and will facilitate a timely ﬁnish by the post-
graduate student.
The student will be based at St Andrews and will be
supervised by Dr. Nathan Bailey. She or he will also
beneﬁt from co-supervision by Prof. Michael Ritchie
and from a highly dynamic and stimulating intellec-
tual environment with regular interaction between ge-
neticists, behavioural ecologists and other evolutionary
biologists. St Andrews is a leader in behavioural re-
search, and there is a vibrant, friendly postgraduate
community. For informal inquiries, contact Nathan at
nwb3@st-andrews.ac.uk. Further details about the lab
can be found on www.ﬂexiblephenotype.org . The suc-
cessful candidate will have a Bachelor’s or Masters de-
gree in a related ﬁeld such as behaviour, evolution or
genetics, and a background in, or a demonstrated abil-
ity to learn, the experimental and statistical techniques
the project will entail. The starting date is September
2012.
Applications must be made through the University of
St Andrews, and forms and further information canbe found on the university website ( http://www.st-

UTartu MolecularEvolution
Funded PhD position in molecular evolutionary bioin-
formatics in the University of Tartu
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD candidate to be
supervised by Dr Gemma Atkinson within the group of
Prof Tanel Tenson in the Institute of Technology, Uni-
versity of Tartu, Estonia.
Dr Atkinson’s research addresses protein functional
evolution, using bioinformatic approaches and primar-
ily focusing on the ancient families of proteins involved
in translation of mRNA to protein. Members of these
families are often essential for life and predate the last
common ancestor of all life on earth. Thus by studying
these proteins we can gain understanding of the funda-
mental processes of life, and how these processes have
evolved over billions of years.
The PhD project will take advantage of the thousands
of whole genome sequences now available for the study
of evolution of protein families from the origin of life to
the present day. Work will involve sensitive sequence
searching to identify the presence and absence of par-
ticular proteins across genomes, phylogenetic analyses
to reconstruct their emergence and evolution, and se-
quence analyses to link domain- and site-speciﬁc pat-
terns of amino acid substitution with molecular func-
tion. Speciﬁcally, the proposed PhD project will target
the ABC superfamily of ATP-binding enzymes found
in all domains of life. This superfamily comprises enig-
matic proteins of diverse, and often unknown func-
tions. Several ABC enzymes have recently been found
to have important roles in regulation of translation
such as ribosome recycling protein Rli1/ABCE1, yeast-
speciﬁc elongation factor eEF3 and starvation response
enzymes Gcn1 and Gcn20.
>From the results of the PhD, it is expected that en-
zymes with novel roles in protein synthesis will come to
light as interesting targets for subsequent experimental40 EvolDir February 1, 2012
study. Dr Atkinson collaborates with the lab Dr Vasili
Hauryliuk, also in Prof Tenson’s group, for biochemical
and genetic validation of in silico results. If the candi-
date so wishes, there is an opportunity to gain practical
lab experience in Dr Hauryliuk’s lab.
The candidate should have:
a Masters degree in a biological or computational dis-
cipline
a strong interest in, and enthusiasm for molecular evo-
lution
familiarity with basic sequence and phylogenetic anal-
yses
experience in using a programming language such as
Python, Perl, Java etc
ﬂuency in spoken and written English
Estonia has a rich culture and beautiful natural envi-

PhD Position in Theoretical Population Genetics at the
University of Vienna
The mathematics and biosciences group (MaBS, home-
page www.mabs.at ) led by Joachim Hermisson at the
University of Vienna is looking for a strong and highly
motivated candidate for a PhD position in evolutionary
modeling and statistical data analysis.
Project: Due to modern methods of high-throughput
sequencing, huge amounts of DNA sequence data from
population samples (“polymorphism data”) are avail-
able today. Interpretation of these data is an important
task for theoreticians. In the project, we will develop
novel methods to detect so-called footprints of selection
in DNA polymorphism data. These footprints can be
used to describe the pattern of recent adaptations on a
genome. We will particularly focus on eﬀects of poly-
genic selection on genetic footprints. We will use math-
ematical methods based on stochastic processes (coales-
cent theory) and extensive computer simulations. The
project is part of an international DFG-research group
“Natural Selection in Structured Populations” in col-
laboration with groups in Evolutionary Biology at the
University of Munich, and Mathematics at the Univer-
sity of Freiburg. This work will be conducted in collab-
oration with Angela Hancock, a postdoctoral researcher
in the MaBS group.
Research environment: Vienna is not only one of the
world’s most liveable cities, but also oﬀers an excellent
research environment and is currently developing into
one of the main centers in evolutionary research in Eu-
rope. The position will be located at the Max F. Perutz
Laboratories, part of the Vienna Biocenter Campus,
which houses a vibrant community of researchers from
several institutes. As a member of the MaBS group, the
student will also interact closely Magnus Nordborg and
members of his group, and will be part of a larger com-
munity of evolutionary biologists and population ge-
neticists through the activities of the Vienna Graduate
School for Population Genetics ( http://www.popgen-
vienna.at ) and EvolVienna ( www.evolVienna.at ).
Conditions: The position is for three years, salary is ac-
cording to the FWF standard rates for PhD students in
Austria. The starting date is somewhat ﬂexible (May
2012, earlier dates negotiable, starting date before sum-
mer/fall 2012 preferred).February 1, 2012 EvolDir 41
Application: We are looking for a candidate with a
strong background in quantitative methods (analytical
or computational modeling or data analysis) and inter-
est in evolutionary research. Applicants should have a
Master / Diploma degree in natural science (e.g. biol-
ogy or physics), mathematics, or bioinformatics. Pro-
gramming skills are highly appreciated. The working
language in the group is English. German skills are not
essential.
All formal applications run through the Max F.

erence ESG-ECO-0072) “Genetic structure of White-
fronted geese”42 EvolDir February 1, 2012
We are looking for an enthousiastic PhD student for the
following research. The family Anser can be thought of
as a well-structured group of species but equally it can
be viewed as a species swarm comprised of species that
are less well deﬁned. So the Grey-lag goose is quite dis-
tinct from the White-fronted goose, but on the other
hand within the Bean goose two or three species may be
hardly distinguishable as cryptospecies. Since crossing
is possible between all Anser species and even between
Anser and Branta, much gene ﬂow is expected between
the species. Yet it is unclear under which conditions
gene ﬂow is frequent and when not. The concept of
supraspecies (as we recently found for ducks) and its
implications for goose evolution has to be investigated.
This can be of signiﬁcance both for the conservation
of these geese as for the understanding of their role in
disease transmission.
We ask that the selected candidate should have a Mas-
ter’s degree, or equivalent, in (eco-)genetics with proven
abilities to interpret his/her results in an ecological con-
text. Preferably she/he can read and speak Russian. A
driving license is a necessity and so is the willingness
and ability to travel independently in Eurasia. Sound
statistical knowledge and proven publication skills are
important.
We oﬀer a full-time position (38 hours), initially for 18
months. If your suitability in this position is apparent,
the period of employment will be extended to the re-
mainder of your PhD-study, with another 30 months.
Gross salary starts at 2042 Euro per month during the
ﬁrst year, increasing to 2612 Euro per month during
the fourth year. Commencing as soon as possible. The
candidate will be based at the Resource Ecology Group
in Wageningen.
We are the Resource Ecology Group and we perform
research and education in community ecology of large
herbivores, with particular emphasis on the interactions
between herbivores and the vegetation and their role in
wildlife disease ecology. This is carried out at aggrega-tion levels ranging from plant part to ecosystem, with
a world-wide geographical focus. Our main research
ﬁelds are (1) rangeland ecology of large herbivores in
extensively managed ecosystems, (2) conservation ge-
netics of large herbivores, and (3) the role of vertebrates
in abundance and movements of pathogens. The re-
search approaches include model development, model
testing, and experimental hypothesis testing. The
main research sites are savannas, grasslands in tropi-
cal and temperate regions, and grasslands and forests
in neotropical regions. Most research is carried out by
post-docs and PhD students, supported by faculty. Re-
sults have a strong bearing on nature conservation and
management in tropical and temperate areas.
The department of Environmental Sciences of Wagenin-
gen University provides fundamental research and aca-
demic education on our living environment: nature,
landscape, land usage, adaptation to climate change,
water and ocean management, and the various com-
peting claims on space. This also includes biodiversity
and the sustainability of management and production.
Wageningen University is part of the Wageningen Uni-
versity and Research Centre concern.
Wageningen University and Research Centre Delivering

tary Research Assistant to help with our pelagic seabird
research on Skomer Island, Pembrokeshire, Wales, in
Spring and Summer 2012. The work will involve several
research projects coordinated by Prof Tim Guilford (see
our website oxnav.zoo.ox.ac.uk). We utilise state-of-
the art tracking technologies (miniature GPS, Geoloca-
tors, & on-board video), and comprehensive automated
activity monitoring systems (RFID controlled burrow-
nest sensing networks), and engages several species
(Manx Shearwater, Atlantic Puﬃn, Common Guille-
mot, Razorbill). Most work will involve assisting two
doctoral students with the day-to-day maintenance of
the burrow sensing systems, weighing and monitoring
breeding birds and their chicks, and the deployment
and retrieval/downloading of tracking devices. There
will be some nocturnal work, since the primary study
species is the Manx Shearwater, which only arrives at
the colony after dark. There will also be scope for in-
volvement in other conservation and ecological projects
on the island, which is a National Nature Reserve ad-
ministered by the Wildlife Trust of South and West
Wales.
There is no stipend, but accommodation (shared) will
be provided, as will travel to the island from within
UK. However, the project is a great opportunity to
gain valuable experience in modern ﬁeld ornithology.
Skomer is a short boat trip away from the mainland
(weather permitting), has mobile coverage, and inter-
net. There is a small community of warden, assis-50 EvolDir February 1, 2012

Application deadline Feb 16 Additional information can
be obtained from Dr. Sip van Wieren, 0317-483434;
sip.vanwieren@wur.nl. 2 PhD projects:
1) evolutionary genetics / molecular ecology (job ref-
erence ESG-ECO-0072) “Genetic structure of White-
fronted geese”56 EvolDir February 1, 2012
We are looking for an enthousiastic PhD student for the
following research. The family Anser can be thought of
as a well-structured group of species but equally it can
be viewed as a species swarm comprised of species that
are less well deﬁned. So the Grey-lag goose is quite dis-
tinct from the White-fronted goose, but on the other
hand within the Bean goose two or three species may be
hardly distinguishable as cryptospecies. Since crossing
is possible between all Anser species and even between
Anser and Branta, much gene ﬂow is expected between
the species. Yet it is unclear under which conditions
gene ﬂow is frequent and when not. The concept of
supraspecies (as we recently found for ducks) and its
implications for goose evolution has to be investigated.
This can be of signiﬁcance both for the conservation
of these geese as for the understanding of their role in
disease transmission.
We ask that the selected candidate should have a
Masterˆ as degree, or equivalent, in (eco-)genetics with
proven abilities to interpret his/her results in an eco-
logical context. Preferably she/he can read and speak
Russian. A driving license is a necessity and so is the
willingness and ability to travel independently in Eura-
sia. Sound statistical knowledge and proven publication
skills are important.
2) ecology (job reference ESG-ECO-0073) “Land use
changes in Russia and their impact on migrating geese”
We are looking for an enthousiastic PhD student for
the following research. The breaking-up of the former
USSR led to profound social and economic changes in
those areas of Russia, White Russia, the Baltic Re-
publics and Ukraine that are important to geese that
migrate in winter to Western Europe. In the country-
side much arable agriculture decreased (especially north
of 55 degrees north but also in the steppe area in the
south), livestock numbers decreased profoundly, river
valleys get overgrown and hunting regimes change. The
PhD student will study land use changes at the hand
of sociological surveys, census outcomes and satellite
imagery with the aim to understand changes in the mi-
gratory routes and population development of Barnacle
geese, White-fronted geese and Bean geese, and to make
well-founded predictions under diﬀerent scenario devel-
opments. This has important implications for goose
conservation.
We ask that the selected candidate should have a Mas-
terˆ as degree, or equivalent, in ecology with proven abil-
ities to interpret remotely sensed imageries. Preferably
she/he can read and speak Russian. A driving licenseis a necessity and so is the willingness and ability to
travel independently in the named countries. Sound
knowledge of spatial statistics is important as well as
proven publication skills.
For both positions:
We oﬀer a full-time position (38 hours), initially for 18
months. If your suitability in this position is apparent,
the period of employment will be extended to the re-
mainder of your PhD-study, with another 30 months.
Gross salary starts at 2042 Euro per month during the
ﬁrst year, increasing to 2612 Euro per month during
the fourth year. Commencing as soon as possible. The
candidate will be based at the Resource Ecology Group
in Wageningen.
We are the Resource Ecology Group and we perform
research and education in community ecology of large
herbivores, with particular emphasis on the interactions
between herbivores and the vegetation and their role in
wildlife disease ecology. This is carried out at aggrega-
tion levels ranging from plant part to ecosystem, with
a world-wide geographical focus. Our main research
ﬁelds are (1) rangeland ecology of large herbivores in
extensively managed ecosystems, (2) conservation ge-
netics of large herbivores, and (3) the role of vertebrates
in abundance and movements of pathogens. The re-
search approaches include model development, model
testing, and experimental hypothesis testing. The
main research sites are savannas, grasslands in tropi-
cal and temperate regions, and grasslands and forests
in neotropical regions. Most research is carried out by
post-docs and PhD students, supported by faculty. Re-
sults have a strong bearing on nature conservation and
management in tropical and temperate areas.
The department of Environmental Sciences of Wagenin-
gen University provides fundamental research and aca-
demic education on our living environment: nature,
landscape, land usage, adaptation to climate change,
water and ocean management, and the various com-
peting claims on space. This also includes biodiversity
and the sustainability of management and production.

Director CanadianInstEcolEvol
The Canadian Institute for Ecology and Evolution
(CIEE/ICEE; http://ciee-icee.com/ ) seeks candidates
for the position of Director. CIEE/ICEE is a national
platform to identify and solve important problems in
ecology and evolution through working groups, work-
shops, and other fora. In its ﬁrst three years, the In-
stitute has mounted working groups on global patterns
in plankton dynamics, the application of science in im-
plementation of the Species at Risk Act, networking of
Canadian ﬁeld stations and, coming this spring, the ef-
fects of rising temperatures on food web structure. The
Institute also sponsors training workshops in conjunc-
tion with the Canadian Society of Ecology and Evolu-
tion, and in June will give it ﬁrst graduate mini-course,
Landscape Genetics. CIEE/ICEE is now poised for
membership and budgetary expansion, and the new Di-
rector will provide leadership and strategic direction asCIEE/ICEE continues to grow and mature. The Direc-
tor is appointed by CIEE/ICEE’s Management Board
(3-year, renewable term) and receives a $5000 yearly
allowance. A Director can be located anywhere.
Responsibilities of the Director include:
- INSTITUTE DEVELOPMENT: The Director pro-
poses and develops new and innovative programs and
partnerships that advance the CIEE/ICEE mission.
This includes the recruitment and retention of mem-
ber institutions.
- PROGRAMS: The Director issues calls for proposals
for CIEE/ICEE programs and, with advice from the
Scientiﬁc Advisory Group, selects proposals for fund-
ing. (An Associate Director arranges practical aspects
of CIEE/ICEE programs, such as travel and housing.)
- COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH: The Di-
rector communicates information on CIEE/ICEE pro-
grams and accomplishments within the Institute, to
relevant administrative oﬃcers at member institutions,
and to the community of potential users.
- FUNDRAISING: The Director seeks ﬁnancial sup-
port from governmental granting programs, universi-
ties, private donors, and other sources. The Manage-
ment Board and the Associate Director assist with this
responsibility.
- BUDGET: The Director (in consultation with the As-
sociate Director) proposes a budget for approval by the
Management Board.
The Directorship of CIEE/ICEE is an opportunity to
have a major inﬂuence on the direction of ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research, and its application, in
Canada. To learn more about this opportunity, contact
the Chair of the Management Board (Stephen Heard,
stephen.heard@unb.ca, 506-452-6047). Applications for
the directorship will be accepted immediately and until

Ernst Mayr Award
Society of Systematic Biologists Ernst Mayr Award
(Graduate Student Award)February 1, 2012 EvolDir 59
The Ernst Mayr Award is given to the presenter of the
outstanding student talk in the ﬁeld of systematics at
the annual meetings of the Society of Systematic Biolo-
gists (SSB). This is SSB’s premier award, and is judged
by the quality and creativity of the research completed
over the course of the student’s Ph.D. program. The
award consists of $1000, a certiﬁcate of distinction, and
a two-year subscription to the journal Systematic Biol-
ogy.
Eligibility: Members of the Society who are advanced
Ph.D. students or have completed their Ph.D. within
the last 15 months are eligible. Applicants may be from
any country, but must be members of SSB, and are ad-
vised to join the Society as soon as possible to be con-
sidered (to join go to: http://systbio.org/?q=node/6 ).
Previous Mayr award winners are not eligible.
Application Procedure: 1. To be considered
for this award, you will need to submit a 400-
word abstract of your talk to the Evolution Ot-
tawa meeting website ( http://www.confersense.ca/-
Evolution2012/index.htm ) at the time of registration.
Instructions for registering as a potential Mayr award
contender will be given on the meeting website. 2.
Abstracts should clearly indicate methods used, con-
clusions, and the relevance to systematics. Presenta-
tions focusing on other areas of biology (ecology, be-
havior, genetics, populations or molecular biology, etc.)
that lack a strong systematics emphasis are not eligible.
This abstract must include the title of the talk, names
and institutions of the authors, and contact information
for the primary author. 3. Applications for this award
will be accepted only until the end of early registration
(April 30, 2012). 4. At the closing of early registra-
tion, a subset of applicants will be selected by the SSB
Awards Committee to present their talks in the Mayr
symposium during the meeting. All applicants will be
notiﬁed about selection decisions by May 15.
Judging: Based on submitted abstracts, the Mayr
Awards Committee (appointed by the Awards Chair,
Sydney Cameron) will select a maximum of 16 appli-
cants for inclusion in the Mayr Award symposium.
The Mayr symposium will be held at a single venue as
a continuous session. Talks will be judged on creativ-
ity, depth and excellence of research, and on quality of
presentation. Competitive students are expected to be
in the ﬁnal stages of their doctoral program, presenting
results of a major body of work.
Co-Authors: The talk may be co-authored. It is under-
stood that the ideas, data and conclusions presented
are primarily and substantially the work of the student
presenter, and the intention is that the student presen-
ter will be senior author on the published version ofthe paper. If a submission includes multiple authors,
include a brief section below the abstract that outlines
the contribution of each author to the research.
Notiﬁcation of Winner: The winner of the award will be
announced at the SSB business meeting in Ottawa and
again during the banquet awards ceremony (compli-
mentary ticket provided) at the conclusion of the Evo-
lution Meetings, whereupon the winner will be given
an award certiﬁcate. An announcement of the win-
ner will be published in Systematic Biology and placed
on the SSB website (see last year’s winner at http://-
systbiol.org/ ).
Please see the SSB website ( http://systbio.org/?q=-
node/10 ) for additional information or updates on this
award.

Genetic correlations estimates
Dear all,
I’m working on a meta-analysis involving genetic cor-
relations (both inter-trait and intra-trait (e.g. cross-
environment or cross-sex)). I would like to ask all who
would be keen to contribute to this project to contact
me if you have any valuable data in this matter. I’m
looking especially for estimates of high genetic correla-
tions in case of realtively low/moderate individual her-
itabilities as such estimates are rarely published. Also
- in case of cross-sex/environment heritabilites high es-
timates accompanied by low heritability estimates are
also desirable. But feel free to include anything you’d
like to oﬀer.
If youd like to provide any data please specify: - es-
timates for h2 and rG with their standard errors (if
possible) + whether i’s inter-trait or cross-sex/env rG -
sample size used to estimate these parameters - statisti-
cal technique (e.g. animal model, full-sib analysis, half-
sib analysis, parent-oﬀspring regression etc.) - whether
the data comes from wild or captive population (if thelatter - whether it’s from artiﬁcially selected cultivars of
some kind) - any relevant information you think might
be important
If you have any questions - feel free to ask. I’ll try to
keep all of data providers posted about progress.
Cheers, sz.

Heat sealing PCR plates
Hi all,
We have had trouble with evaporation during 10 uL
PCRs run in 96-well plates. Samples on the perimeter
of the plate routinely evaporate when the sealing tape
opens up around the plate edges.
As a possible solution to this problem, our lab is consid-
ering the purchase of heat sealer, such as the Eppendorf
PCR Plate Heat Sealer, for use with sealing foil.
Can anyone attest to the eﬀectiveness of this method?
Is evaporation completely eliminated for small volume
PCR when using a heat sealer? Are there other solu-
tions we should consider?
Thanks for any feedback,

changes (any measure of size) between diploid malesFebruary 1, 2012 EvolDir 61
and haploid males (and/or triploid workers and normal
diploid workers) in the hymenoptera. I would appreci-

Mini-ARTS grant
The Society of Systematic Biologists is pleased to an-
nounce the availability of awards for revisionary tax-
onomy and systematics, modeled after the NSF Dear
Colleague Letter: Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy
and Systematics (ARTS) recently developed within the
Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster. We areFebruary 1, 2012 EvolDir 63
calling these ’mini-ARTS’ grants. These awards are
designed to allow SSB members (students, post-docs,
and faculty) to spend a summer or semester appren-
ticed to an expert in a particular taxonomic group or
to enhance revisionary taxonomic and systematics re-
search in novel ways. Goals of this award program are
to address constraints on our knowledge of undescribed
biodiversity, assist in passing on taxonomic expertise
before it is lost, increase the number of students with
broad training in organismal biology and systematics,
and support projects in biodiversity and taxonomy in-
formatics as well as monographic and revisionary tax-
onomy. Activities can include a trip to the taxonomist’s
laboratory, pay for the taxonomist to visit the appli-
cant’s laboratory for a period of time, or pay for costs
of computer time or development of interactive keys
for electronic dissemination of systematics results. Re-
quests for support may be in any amount up to $3,000.
We will fund two or three of these awards this year.
Please visit NSF’s website http://www.nsf.gov/-
pubs/2011/nsf11037/nsf11037.jsp for more information
about their ARTS program.
How to apply A complete application includes 1) a brief
description of the project, including a separate section
justifying the importance of the taxon and the revision-
ary work, 2) an itemized budget, 3) the applicant’s CV,
and 4) a letter of support from the taxonomic expert or
collaborator. If the applicant is a student or post-doc,
please also include a reference letter from the advisor.
Applicants may be from any country, but must be mem-
bers of SSB, and are advised to join the Society as soon
as possible to facilitate their applications (to join go to:
http://systbio.org/?q=node/6 ). The narrative part of
the application should be no more than two pages, in-
cluding the budget, but not including the curriculum
vitae and letter(s).
Grant applications should be sent to the SSB Awards
Committee (ssb-apps@life.illinois.edu). E-mail submis-
sions are required, and applicants should use pdf for-
mat for all documents. In the subject line of the email,
please indicate the SSB award category as ’mini-ARTS’.
Please see the SSB website ( http://systbio.org/?q=-
node/26 ) for any updates or additional information
about this award.
Application deadline is March 31, 2012

Outgroups with winclada nona
Dear Evoldir partners, First of all HAPPY 2012 for you
all!
Does anybody know how to designate the outgroup(s)
to use winclada/nona for parsimomy analysis?
Thanks, Rodrigo A. Torres
rodrigotorres@ufpe.brOutlier analyses answers
Dear All,
Many thanks for all of you who have replied to my post
on Evoldir last week. The responses were very useful
and as many requested me to forward them the replies,
I have summarised them below. For privacy’s sake I
have left out people’s names.
Thank you once again,
Serinde
My original post:
I am running outlier analyses on a set of 25 markers but
ﬁnd discrepancies between diﬀerent methods, which I
ﬁnd hard to explain. The dataset is comprised of both
putatively neutral microsatellites and candidate SNP
loci in genes of interest for divergently selected popula-
tions over 6 generations (50 individuals per population).
Fdist and Schlotterer’s method are fairly consistent in
the identiﬁcation of outlier loci, which also correspond
to patterns of allelic divergence and results obtained
from exploratory analyses (AMOVA, correspondence
analysis). The output from BayeScan however is very
diﬀerent: rather than indicating divergent selection at
the loci identiﬁed by Fdist and Schlotterer’s methods
(and others) other loci are identiﬁed as under balancing
selection. There therefore appears to be a bias towards
balancing selection rather than diversifying selection at
the expected loci, which doesn’t make biological sense
in the case of my data. Analysing microsatellites and
SNPs independently does not radically change the ﬁnd-
ings.
I would like to know if anyone has observed similar dis-
crepancies between BayeScan and other outlier analyses
or could think of ways how such a shift (identiﬁcation
of diﬀerent loci under balancing selection rather than
the same loci under divergent selection) could be ex-
plained. Any suggestions would be extremely helpful.
Thank you very much in advance.
The responses:
—–
1) The methods are really diﬀerent, so you shouldn’t
be shocked if they yield diﬀerent results.
2) The Beaumont & Nichols FDIST/Lositan test is very
intuitive and understandable, so if it does conﬁrm likelyFebruary 1, 2012 EvolDir 65
divergent selection at those candidate loci for which you
already had biological knowledge, then that is a strong
indication!
3) Consider that in most cases these tests are conducted
on samples from wild populations, with large Ne and
very little knowledge about them. You may have a lot
of knowledge about your populations, and over 6 gen-
erations. Also if your populations are small and there
is a strong genetic drift signal in your data maybe that
aﬀects the results of Bayescan. I remember some ex-
periments on Drosophila that showed that when you
have lab populations undergoing strong genetic drift,
the signal of selection may not be so obvious. Maybe
FDIST picks it up, and Bayescan doesn’t.
4) Do you have 2 or more populations? If you have
more, you could try to do tests per pairs.
5) You could also try to use multivariate ordination
techniques (like PCA or FCA), separately for microsats
and SNPs, and plot your individuals alongside the alle-
les, to see if there is any decisive pattern of association
between certain alleles that you expect to be under se-
lection and those individuals that had been exposed to
said selective pressure (I suspect that if there is a real
signal of selection, you should see some striking scat-
tering).
So, these were my two-cent - good luck with your re-
search!
—–
I saw you message on evoldir. Sorry I cant be of much
use, but Id be interested in the response you get so if
you dont post a summary on evoldir, perhaps you could
forward the replies to me? One thought did occur. Per-
haps your results are not as diﬀerent from each other
as they appear, it just seems that the assessment of di-
vergent selection by BayeScan has shifted down for all
loci. In that case outlier loci look like loci under ordi-
nary drift only, and loci under drift look to be under
stabilising selection. Perhaps a problem with your prior
settings? Good luck in ﬁguring out the diﬀerence and
which program does the better job in your case
—–
It is a general issue that BayeScan seems to be more
conservative than alternative tests (see attached if you
haven’t already), but be aware of the major ﬂaw in their
discussion of the hierarchical model. I don’t know how
large your Fst values are, but for marine ﬁsh (approx.
Fst=0.0001-0.04) we do also often get candidates for
balancing selection, but they’re most likely false posi-
tives, and as long as the neutral background Fst is rel-
atively low, I don’t think it’s possible to reliably detecttrue balancing selection in these types of tests. Thus, I
wouldn’t worry too much about that result. The lack of
outliers in BayeScan may simply be due to low power
in your dataset, but I guess that if you couple these
observations with time series plots of Fst for the other
outliers that could reinforce the results (does it make
sense).
—–
How large is your Fst values over time? Does it make
sense that the signal is simply too low for BayeScan to
detect? A simulation trial

Queensland VolFieldAssist
RainForestDrosophila
Field assistants required to study limits to adaptation
in Australian rainforest Drosophila
We are looking for up to three motivated, hardworking
volunteers to assist with ﬁeldwork in northern Queens-
land as part of a project examining limits to adaptation
in rainforest Drosophila.
The project is being carried out by researchers at the
University of Bristol, UK (PI Dr Jon Bridle, postdoc Dr
Eleanor O’Brien), in collaboration with researchers at
the University of Queensland (Professor Mark Blows)
and the University of Melbourne (Professor Ary Hoﬀ-
mann). This position represents an excellent opportu-
nity to be involved in exciting research in evolutionary
biology, and would suit someone seeking direct experi-
ence of a ﬁeld-based project in this area.
The role of the volunteer will be to assist with collec-
tion of Drosophila at several locations in the rainforest
in northern Queensland, sort ﬁeld-collected specimens,
conduct mark-recapture and ﬁeld ﬁtness experiments,
as well as maintain live stocks and perform other du-
ties as required. Training will be provided in Drosophila
identiﬁcation and maintenance, although previous ex-
perience would be helpful.
Essential requirements: (1) BSc in evolutionary biol-
ogy, genetics, ecology or a related discipline. (2) Will-
ingness to spend long days working in the rainforest in
hot, humid conditions. (3) Ability to work carefully
and meticulously, with close attention to detail. (4)
Enthusiasm and the ability to work as part of a team.
(5) A full driving license.
Previous ﬁeldwork experience and 4 wheel-driving ex-
perience would also be an advantage.
The volunteer must be able to spend up to 8 weeks in
the ﬁeld from early April - late May 2012. Full living
expenses (meals and accommodation) will be paid dur-
ing this period. We are also able to make a contribution
of up to £400 (approx. $AU640) towards the costs of
travel to the ﬁeld site.
Applications should be received by the 1st February
2012, and must include a cover letter and CV, includ-
ing the names of two referees.

Reference choice models
Dear all, I am quite new in phylogeny and I know
the very bases. I know some books about phylogeny,
but they all seem to present phylogeny methods and
distance matrices models without explaining how to
make a good choice between those methods and mod-
els (though it is interesting to compare the results from
diﬀerent methods).
My question is thus: do you know some interesting ref-
erences (in English or in French) explaining practically
how to select among phylogeny methods and models
depending on your data ?
Thank you very much in advance. Regards,

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
I have uploaded a new version of DAMBE with the fol-
lowing improvement:
1. Tip-dating based on the least-squares criterion:
Some users suggested that the input sequence name
format (OTUname@Year) is not suﬃcient. For exam-
ple, two viral sequences sampled at the end of 1999
and the beginning of 2000, respectively, could be just
a few days apart instead of a whole year apart. I
have added two more formats: year with decimals, e.g.,
OTUname@1999.98 and OTUname@DDMMYYYY.
2. Eﬀective number of codons: some users have asked
for this function, and it is added with some improve-
ments. In particular, the original formulation han-
dles short sequences poorly and the eﬀective number
of codons could be more than 100. I dealt with this
problem by adding the option for pseudocount (which
I suggest should not be greater than 1, which is also
the default). There are also a few other things that
I will explain in more detail if you are interested to
use the function. The function is accessible by click-
ing ’Seq.Analysis |Codon usage |Nc: Eﬀective number of
codons’.
3. Numbering notation: After spending a part of my
sabbatical in Europe (mostly in Turku, Finland), I have
noticed that the European use of ’,’ for ’.’ (e.g., 1.234,56
instead of 1,234.56) aﬀects some of DAMBE’s functions.
I believe that I have ﬁxed them all. Please let me knowif you experience anything unusual.
Please download the new version.

prehensive software package for extensive data anal-
ysis in molecular biology and evolution for Windows

Hi folks,
We have developed a software program that might help
in identifying rapidly-evolving sites without the draw-
back of having a starting tree.
The program is called “tiger” and it is available here:
http://bioinf.nuim.ie/tiger It is written in python, the
code is open source and the program should run on all
platforms.
The paper describing the method and some results from
our analyses using this method can be found here:

Spectrophotometer question
Dear all,
Recently I’ve started using Jaz spectrophotometer for
reﬂectance measurements in the ﬁeld. it work ﬁne but
I’m having troubles analysing its output ﬁles (I know,
there’s SpectraSuite but it’s missing necessary options,
has very poor manual and is slow). There are several
applications that were created for this - e.g. CLR an
RCLR apps (they have problems reading jaz dataﬁles,
RCLR fails to read the data correctly even after re-
formating it to the desired structure). And here’s thequestion: before I start wrestling with my enemy (I’ve
planned to write my own R/python script for handling
jaz ﬁles) - have any of You, Evoldir Readers, ever en-
countered such problems. Maybe you know some other
(free) software options that could be of help here? If so
- I’d be greatful for letting me know.

Titanium 454 provider
Request 454 Titanium XL+ provider
Dear all
I am looking for a provider oﬀering the longer titaniumxl+ chemistry for pooled amplicon sequencing. Anyone
knows a company already oﬀering the 454 xl+ chem-
istry with up to 1000bp, the response so far was “plan-
ning on installing the new version” but only oﬀers for
the titanium chemistry...
Best regards

454 Titanium+ providers: Answers
Dear Evoldir Community,
thank you for your responses to a request about Ti-
tanium XL + providers I posted a few days ago. As
several people asked me to share the results, ﬁnd blow
a compilation of helpful answers I received, and a list
of companies which conﬁrmed using XL+ chemistry.

Dear Gregor,
The Centre for Genomic Research atUniversity ofLiv-
erpool runs 2x 454xl+ machines. Both shotgun and
amplicon libraries. Note that 1000bp is the absolute
maximum read. Median is more like 700 - 750bp.
Contact our centre manager, Dr Christiane Hertz-
Fowler, if you’d like a quote or further details.

Dear Gregor,
I’ve had your request for a 454 Titanium XL+ provider
passed on to me from a colleague that is on the same
email list as you. We do currently oﬀer 454 Titanium72 EvolDir February 1, 2012
XL+ sequencing and have for a few months now.
However, these kits are currently not supported for am-
plicon sequencing (only for gDNA and cDNA libraries)
and Roche strongly recommends that amplicons still
be run using the Titanium XLR70 kits. I have run one
short amplicon library as a test for a customer with the
XL+ kits and the data was not nearly as good as has
been obtained for his similar libraries sequenced with
the XLR70 kits. Other service providers have said the
same, the XL+ kits consistently give worse results for
amplicons. This is due at least in part to the software
not yet being updated/optimised for longer amplicons.
I hope this you ﬁnd this information helpful.
Kind regards,
Jason Koval

We are seeking a post-doctoral fellow to lead a project
on ecological and phylogeographic determinants of
species and populations boundaries in subterranean ro-
dents of the genus Ctenomys. The project seeks to un-
derstand the evolutionary biology of populations and
species of the genus, commonly known as tuco-tucos,in
fragmented habitats in a marshland in northern Ar-
gentina. In order to generate a comprehensive pictureof the evolutionary dynamics of the group, phenomena
belonging to three diﬀerent sources/scales will be con-
sidered: (1) A spatial approach involving comparisons
of the degree of diﬀerentiation in fragmented vs. con-
tinuous populations, (2) a temporal approach, which
considers comparisons of the populations before and
after the fragmentation event, and (3) a model based
approach, which will simulate genetic diﬀerentiation re-
sulting from diverse scenarios of habitat isolation and
fragmentation. The project is led by Dr. Patricia
Mirol, from the Argentinian Natural History Museum
in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dr. Marcelo Kittlein, from
Mar del Plata University, Argentina and Dr. Oscar
Gaggiotti, from U. J. Fourier, Grenoble, France. The
successful candidate will conduct ﬁeldwork in Corri-
entes, Argentina, in order to analyze landscape genetics
and ecology of the species, including demographic pa-
rameters in two model populations and measurement of
dispersal using radiotelemetry; labwork to obtain geno-
types of the sampled animals; and it will also work on
the development of model based approaches to simulate
genetic diversity under diﬀerent fragmentation scenar-
ios. The project start date is to be no earlier than
April 2012 and project duration is 2 years. To be
considered for this position, please send your CV to

Postdoctoral Position in Chordate Comparative Em-
bryology
A recent PhD or junior-level Postdoctoral Fellow is
sought to join the Rui Diogo laboratory, at the
Howard University College of Medicine, Department of
Anatomy (Washington DC).
We are interested in a candidate that will contribute
to uncover evolutionary and developmental mechanisms
underlying both hard tissue (cartilages and bones) and
soft tissue (mainly muscles) formation and patterning
during ontogeny of a wide range of vertebrate taxa, as
well as soft tissue in non-vertebrate taxa such as sea
squirts. Some of the issues and broader questions in
which we are particularly interested include: the paral-
lelism between ontogeny and phylogeny, the remarkable
similarity between the hard and particularly the soft
tissues of the upper and lower limbs of tetrapods, the
importance of evolutionary reversions/neotenic events,
the study of birth defects and their implications for
medicine and for the understanding of evolutionary bi-
ology, and the regeneration of hard and soft tissues
in key vertebrate taxa. For more information about
these subjects and about other issues being studied in
the lab, please see www.ruidiogolab.com . The suc-
cessful candidate will have a PhD degree with a broad
experience in molecular biology and developmental bi-
ology (e.g., doing/using developmental techniques such
as antibody staining, in situs, and cell tracing, among
others), backed by publications in peer-reviewed jour-
nals, and also some experience in comparative anatomy.
He/She will have the skills and motivation to pursue a
career in research, be interested in studying and com-
paring a wide range of taxa and various model organ-
isms and in discussing various evolutionary and devel-
opmental issues.
There are funds available for two years, the ﬁrst con-
tract being for one year, the second contract depending
on the productivity, interest and dedication of the can-
didate. There are possibilities to continue being part
of the lab after the two-year period of the post-doc po-
sition. The post-doc will also have the opportunity to
take classes, and then to be instructor, of human gross
anatomy; this will further allow him/her to also postu-
late for faculty positions in medical schools in the DCarea (including Howard University) as well as in other
regions.
Interested candidates should send a CV including re-
search interests, a list of publications and the names
and contact information for three references to Rui
Diogo, at rui.diogo@howard.edu. Please write “post-
doc in Diogo’s lab” followed by your last name in the
email subject.
Howard University is a historical University situated
in the center of Washington DC, which is a beautiful,
green and enjoyable city with numerous cultural and
outdoor activities. The Department of Anatomy pro-
vides a prosperous, resourceful and multidisciplinary
environment for biomedical research, includes faculty
with a broad experience in developmental biology, pa-
leontology, neurobiology, comparative anatomy and
medicine. We have strong ties with surrounding institu-
tions, particularly with George Washington University,
and the candidate will probably have the opportunity
to do part of his/her research at those institutions and
thus to expand his/her knowledge and academic con-
nections.

The evolution of vertebrate dentition is an area of in-
vestigation common to both developmental biology and
paleontology. The Viriot team is recognized for its
works on the Evo-Devo of dentition in rodents, cyprini-
formes ﬁsh, and crocodiles. We now wish to extend the
realm of our research to *bird paleobiology*, with the
aim of *investigating shape, function, renewal and loss
of the dentition*. Team’s major assets are (1) our ex-
pertise in dental comparative anatomy, (2) our skills in
3D imaging and morphometrics, and (3) our Evo-Devo
studies of the dentition including data from the fossil
record as a crucial component of our investigations.
All living birds are toothless, constituting by far the
most diverse toothless vertebrate clade, and are striking
examples of evolutionary success following tooth loss.
In recent years, an unprecedented number of Mesozoic
birds have been described, illustrating the evolution of
dentition reductions. Simultaneously, major advances
in experimental embryology have yielded new results
concerning avian edentulism. *This post-doc proposes
to investigate the evolutionary developmental biology
of tooth loss in birds mostly emphasizing on develop-
mental biology aspects*.
*Applications are invited from candidates **who have
previously worked on the morphogenesis, shape and
evolution of dentition in a vertebrate group, whichever
their background (from paleontology to developmental
biology).*
*Knowledge in craniofacial anatomy, as well as skills in
development biology, mineralized tissue histology, mi-

*Genomewide characterization of the eﬀect of modern
selection on genetic diversity and identiﬁcation of orig-
inal genetic resources in maize * *Scientiﬁc context*
: Postdoctoral position is to ﬁll as soon as possible
at beginning of 2012 for a minimum of 18 months at
the Plant Genetics Moulon Lab ( http://moulon.inra.fr )
and at the UMR AGAP in Montpellier (South of
France) . Plant Genetics Moulon Lab conducts research
on the determinism of complex traits and valorization
of genetic diversity in plants and is located in Paris
suburb’s (South of Paris 30 km) in an exceptional sci-
entiﬁc environment. *Background:* The maize genetic
resources, as for most crops, remain largely underex-
ploited in modern breeding programs because it’s very
hard and time-consuming to identify in the genetic re-
sources collections the favorable alleles for agronomic
traits of interest and transfer these in elite cultivated
pools. During the early twentieth century, the modern
selection of maize extracted inbred lines from maize lan-
draces (populations) to produce hybrid in a controlled
manner, and then exploit the hybrid vigor (heterosis)
to meet the needs of modern agriculture (homogene-
ity, stability). During this transition of varieties from
landraces to hybrids many favorable alleles have proba-
bly been lost because of their association with unfavor-
able alleles and/or genetic drift. However, the eﬀect of
this transition on genetic diversity is still poorly under-
stood. *Aims of the project: * The aims of the project
are to characterize the genetic diversity between and
within population landraces of maize to (i) identify ge-
netically original populations to be used in selection
and possibly identify some favorable alleles by associa-
tion mapping (ii) quantify the eﬀect of selection on the
evolution of genetic diversity throughout the genome.
Two case studies will be considered (i) the population
landraces to hybrid evolution and (ii) recurrent selec-
tion for adaptation to drought. *Scientiﬁc program: *
The selected candidate will analyze and compare the
genetic diversity of 150 representative maize popula-
tion landraces by using 50 000 SNPs distributed along
the genome (Ganal et /al./, 2011) and a collection of
1000 populations using a subset of SNPs. The selected
candidate will implement and possibly improve the sta-
tistical methods to quantify allele frequencies of the
SNPs from DNA pooling of individuals belonging to
each population. Based on these allele frequencies es-82 EvolDir February 1, 2012
timated at each SNPs, the selected candidate will 1)
assess the contribution of diﬀerent factors explaining
the genetic structure of populations including the use
of the spatial coordinates of these populations and/or
historical information 2) compare the diversity of these
populations to that present within panels of inbred lines
representing the diversity presently used in breeding 3)
compare the evolution of genetic diversity in four trop-
ical populations selected for their drought tolerance,
to identify possibly genomic regions under selection 4)
identify most original populations among a collection of
1000 populations to be used as sources to increase the
diversity of existing breeding program. The genotyp-
ing data have already been acquired on almost inbred
lines (900 in total) and about half of the population
and will be completed up to 150 populations at the
start of the project. The selected candidate could orga-
nize/perform complementary genotyping of additional
populations landraces and inbred lines if required. He
will work at the UMR AGAP in Montpellier (South-
East of France) where is located the maize landraces
genetic resources collection and recurrent selection pop-
ulations program (B. Gouesnard and A. Zanetto) and
the INRA station of St. Martin de Hinx (South-West
of Frances) where is located the inbred lines genetic
resources collection (J. Laborde). He will also work
in connection with private maize breeders. *Skills:*
PhD in genetics or in plant breeding. Goods skills
in quantitative and population genetics and statistics
and in R programming, other (s) language (s) appre-
ciated (s), Knowledge in plant breeding and / or ge-

MosquitoGenomics
POSITION DESCRIPTION
A postdoctoral position is available in the lab of Dr.
Bradley White at the University of California River-side. The long-term goal of the lab is to identify the
genetic polymorphisms that control natural variation in
medically and ecologically important traits of malaria
mosquitoes and to characterize the evolutionary forces
that create and maintain these polymorphisms.
Currently, research in the lab focuses on the two main
vectors of malaria in Africa – Anopheles gambiae and
Anopheles funestus. Both mosquitoes belong to species
complexes composed of at least seven isomorphic sib-
ling species. Each complex exhibits a gradient of vec-
torial capacity with species ranging from non-vectors
to major vectors. Consequently, these two systems of-
fer an excellent opportunity to investigate, at both the
genetic and phenotypic levels, why some species trans-
mit malaria while others do not. Moreover, due to the
varying hybridization levels among sibling species this
system is also useful for studying the formation and
preservation of species boundaries under diﬀerent de-
grees of gene ﬂow. The genome of An. gambiae was
sequenced in 2002 and the genome of An. funestus will
be sequenced in 2012, providing an excellent platform
for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits.
Currently, three projects are ongoing in the lab includ-
ing (1) the evolution of anti-malarial genes (An. gam-
biae), (2) the genomics of species boundaries (An. gam-
biae), and (3) the genetic basis of host preference (An.
funestus). As this position is not directly tied to fund-
ing for a particular project, the successful candidate
will have an opportunity to pursue any of the above
topics and will be given the latitude to develop addi-
tional research questions. For more background please
see the publications listed at:
< http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3DbI-
WIgMAAAAJ&hl=3Den >
TO APPLY
A minimum qualiﬁcation is a PhD or equivalent in Bi-
ology, Computer Science, or a related discipline. Appli-
cants should be highly motivated, intellectually curious,
and possess expertise in population genomics, compu-
tational genomics, vector biology, or insect behavior. A
willingness to travel to Africa is a plus, as is the ability

EvolComputGenetics
The Balloux lab has recently relocated to the UCL Ge-
netics Institute (UGI) at University College London
and will have openings for three postdoctoral positions.
Over recent years, we have witnessed unprecedented
progress in genetic sequencing technologies. As a result,
we are now in a position to sequence large numbers of
genomes from a variety of organisms in no time and atreasonable cost. However, genomic data in itself does
little more than clog up computers.
This is where the lab ﬁts in. Its mission statement is
to harness genomic information to address important
questions in evolution, epidemiology and public health,
through the analysis of genomic datasets and the de-
velopment of new methodological tools. The empiri-
cal work is primarily centred on humans and human
pathogens (MRSA, the plague and malaria). Research
in the lab also aims at overcoming the divide between
fundamental and applied science. As such, the work
spans a large continuum ranging from the fundamen-
tal (e.g. reconstructing the colonisation of the world
by our ancestors) to the applied (e.g. tracking MRSA
infections in hospital wards).
Two positions are in human evolutionary genetics and
are funded by the BBSRC. The successful applicants for
these posts will be involved in a long-term collaborative
project between Francois Balloux and Andrea Manica
at Cambridge University on the relative role of past de-
mography and natural selection in shaping the human
genomic diversity. The third position is ERC funded
and its primary objective of the post holder will be to
develop and apply new methodologies taking advantage
of genomic data to reconstruct transmission chains in
disease (“who infected whom”).
Job descriptions and person speciﬁcation for each
post can be accessed at the following URL: https:/-

numbers for the posts are 1227782 and 1228554 for

one in infectious disease epidemiology. Informal en-

ULiverpool HostParasite
Postdoctoral position in Host-parasite evolutionary
ecology. University of Liverpool
Inherited microbes have recently emerged as incredi-
bly important elements of arthropod ecology and evo-
lution, determining host features as diverse as repro-
ductive system, susceptibility to natural enemies, and
host plant usage. Despite passing maternally from a
female to her progeny within species, these microbes
establish regularly in new host species following host
shifts events. However, the ’ﬁt’ in new host-symbiont
combinations is never perfect. This project will con-
sider two question:
a) To what extent does natural selection in the early
stage of new symbioses act to produce a ﬁt between
microbe and host?
b) What microbe systems are involved in producing this
ﬁt?
We are seeking a postdoctoral scientist to join a NERC
funded project examining the eﬀects of host shift events
on the tempo and mode of evolution of inherited mi-
crobes. The project will generate ’artiﬁcial’ combina-
tions of host and microbe and examine the transmis-
sion rate and ﬁtness eﬀects of these microbes at the
point of introduction. The parasite will then be pas-
saged through the new host and its evolution monitored
both through phenotypic assays and whole genome re-
sequencing. The latter will be used to create a view
of how evolutionary rates alter on a genome scale fol-
lowing host shift events of diﬀerent magnitudes, and
also to identify the elements of the genome that are
evolving in response to host shift events. This data
will then be examined alongside genome sequence fornatural isolates of the parasite obtained from diﬀerent
host species in the wild, to examine whether host shift
events have driven the diversiﬁcation of the pathogen
that is observed in the natural environment.
The project will work use Nasonia wasps as a model
host. In addition to driving the project, the postdoc
will be expected to manage the daily activities of a tech-
nician in maintaining and characterizing the infections.
The work will require someone who is hardworking and
meticulous, and able to maintain long term experimen-
tal cultures of insects and their parasites. Quantitative
skills are also important. The project will require
analysis of NGS data, although training will be given
in this area if necessary. The project is for 2.5 years,
and is supervised by Prof. Greg Hurst, Prof. Steve
Paterson, Dr. Mike Brockhurst and Dr. Kayla King at
the Institute of Integrative biology at the University of
Liverpool ( http://www.liv.ac.uk/integrative-biology/-
). The appointee will join the Ecology, Evolution
and Genomics of Infectious Disease Research Group
(http://www.liv.ac.uk/integrative-biology/research/-
ecology-evolution-and-genomics-of-infectious-disease/ ).
This research group, which comprises eight academic
staﬀ members and their individual groups, investigate
host-parasite interactions at a variety of levels, with
particular interests in Wildlife disease dynamics, the
impact of coinfection on the ecological and evolutionary
dynamics of parasites, the dynamics of coevolution be-
tween hosts and parasites, and Parasite genomics. The
group is currently supported by extensive grants from
the NERC, Wellcome Trust, BBSRC and MRC. Three

The postdoc fellow will work on the project The early
stages of the speciation process - prezygotic reproduc-
tive isolation and diversiﬁcation in passerines, funded
by the Research Council of Norway and NHM. Speci-
ation is a fundamental evolutionary process in which
lineages diverge to form new species. Understanding
speciation processes is essential for understanding the
evolution of biodiversity. Sexual selection may play a
role in speciation processes, e.g. by promoting evolu-
tion of secondary sexual traits and preferences in al-
lopatry, leading to divergence and premating isolation
upon secondary contact. However, if sexual ornaments
do not diverge in allopatry, populations may evolve
deep genetic divergence but still despeciate upon sec-
ondary contact. The postdoctoral fellow will investi-
gate cases of deep sympatric intraspeciﬁc divergences in

ing multilocus coalescence-based analyses, and explore

(EBC) with starting date being May 1 ^st , 2012, or
as soon as possible after this date. The Evolutionary
Biology Center hosts one of the world’s largest aggrega-
tions of evolutionary biologists, and is a prime research
environment for a wide range of ﬁelds in evolutionary
biology and genetics (see “ http://www.ebc.uu.se/” for
more information). The working atmosphere is very
international with English as our operational language.
Uppsala University is the oldest university in Scandi-
navia and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town
with beautiful surroundings conveniently situated 40
minutes with train from Stockholm.
*Brief research outline: **The holder of this posi-
tion will direct research towards an evolutionary un-
derstanding of **the genomics of metabolic rate**. In-
sects (seed beetles) will serve as the model system.
The candidate will ﬁrst complete a collaborative eﬀort
to produce a /de novo/ complete genome sequence of
our main model system (/Callosobruchus maculatus/)
which is currently underway. The holder of this posi-
tion will then concentrate on the genetics of metabolic
rate using focussed genotype-phenotype matching and
upon sex-speciﬁc selection on discrete genotypes us-
ing experimental genomics. This research will involve
whole-organism phenotyping of metabolic rate (using
a state-of-the art respirometry system) and will focus
on those nuclear and mitochondrial genes that are in-
volved in the oxphos pathway and epistatic interactions
between these.*
*This post*doctoral position forms a part of a new
project on genetic conﬂict, funded by the European Re-
search Council and the Swedish Research Council. The
entire project will employ some 6-8 postdocs and PhD
students, apart from a full time TA and the PI, and
will strongly encourage interactions and collaborations
within the group.**
*Salary and appointment*: The period of initial ap-
pointment is two years, with the possibility of pro-
longing the contract with another two years *(i.e.,
2+2 years)*. Uppsala University adopts an individual
salary policy but the starting salary for postdoctoral
researchers is typically about 29.000 SEK per month
and includes full social beneﬁts.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate must have a
Ph.D, or an exam which is judged comparable to a
PhD, that was completed within three years of the ap-
plication deadline. Applicants that received their PhD
earlier than this date will be considered if special cir-February 1, 2012 EvolDir 91
cumstances exist (such as prolonged periods of illness,
parental leave, military service, union duties and others
of similar character).
*Qualiﬁcations and merits*: The ideal candidate has a
documented expertise in using genomic tools in evolu-
tionary biology and has a documented interest in the
study of phenotypic selection and/or general evolution-
ary theory. Experience of /de novo/ next-generation
sequencing is a merit, as is experience of genotype-
phenotype matching using genomic data and/or com-
parative genomics. Experience of laboratory work
with insects and/or previous experience of work with
respirometry phenotyping of metabolism will also be
considered merits. Because the holder of this position
will interact and collaborate closely with other mem-
bers of the group, we will put emphasis on both inde-
pendence and ability to collaborate. The holder of this
position will be responsible for orchestrating part of the
larger research project as an independent junior scien-
tist and the ideal candidate therefore already has some
postdoctoral research experience.**
*To apply:*Candidates should submit a cover letter, a
curriculum vitae including a list of publications and a
short (1-3 pages) description of past research accom-
plishments and future research ambitions. Applicants

tative genetic techniques. The research will establish
a series of discrete genotypes and use crosses between
these to describe and understand the architecture of
sexually antagonistic genetic variation. Traits in focus
are sex speciﬁc measures of life history traits (especially
metabolic parameters) and life-time ﬁtness. ***
*This post*doctoral position forms a part of a new
project on genetic conﬂict, funded by the European Re-
search Council and the Swedish Research Council. The
entire project will employ some 6-8 postdocs and PhD
students, apart from a full time TA and the PI, and
will strongly encourage interactions and collaborations
within the group.
*Salary and appointment*: Period of appointment is
two years. Uppsala University adopts an individual
salary policy but the starting salary for postdoctoral
researchers is typically about 29.000 SEK per month
and includes full social beneﬁts.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate must have a
Ph.D, or an exam which is judged comparable to a
PhD, that was completed within three years of the ap-
plication deadline. Applicants that received their PhD92 EvolDir February 1, 2012
earlier than this date will be considered if special cir-
cumstances exist (such as prolonged periods of illness,
parental leave, military service, union duties and others
of similar character).
*Qualiﬁcations and merits*: We seek candidates with
a documented expertise in quantitative genetic analy-
ses and with a ﬁrm understanding of life history theory.
Experience of laboratory work with insects is a merit as
is previous experience of work with respirometry assays
of metabolism. Because the holder of this position will
collaborate and interact closely with other members of
the group, we will put emphasis on both independence
and ability to collaborate.
*To apply:*Candidates should submit a cover letter, a
curriculum vitae including a list of publications and a
short (1-3 pages) description of past research accom-
plishments and future research ambitions. Applicants
should also include names and e-mail addresses of two

The Cutter lab at the University of Toronto is seek-
ing a postdoctoral researcher to study the genetic basis
of adaptation and reproductive isolation. The Cutter
lab uses Caenorhabditis nematodes related to C. ele-
gans as a model system to investigate these problems
in evolutionary genetics. In particular, we are trying
to understand how evolutionary adaptation to temper-
ature by C. briggsae manifests in terms of sequence
changes to its genome, and to understand the evolution
of genetic incompatibilities between C. briggsae and a
close relative. To do so, we are applying and devel-
oping resources for mapping with advanced intercross
recombinant inbred line (RIL) and near isogenic intro-
gression line (NIL) strain libraries, coupled with high-
throughput next-generation sequence-based genotyping
and functional experiments, to determine the identity
and function of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN).

March17-Apr1
We announce a beginner’s programming course for evo-
lutionary biology.
The course will take place at the University Leipzig
from March 17th to April 1st 2012.
Website: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de “Nothing in
Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution”
(Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolutionary biology often98 EvolDir February 1, 2012
involves the analysis of an unprecedented amount of
information and supports many other disciplines, such
as medicine (evolutionary medicine), behavioral biol-
ogy (evolutionary psychology), ecology, and informa-
tion transfer. Scientists have to analyze large datasets,
which requires computational programming skills to de-
sign and apply own ideas into customized algorithms.
In this intensive 16 days course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on expe-
rience in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the ﬁeld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a fo-
cus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
“learning by doing”, which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as ﬁnal projects in small
groups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs
of evolutionary biology or related research ﬁelds with
no or little programming experience who want to be-
come proﬁcient in computational evolutionary biology
in a couple of weeks.
The course will take place at the University Leipzig,
which is conveniently located in the center of the city.
Leipzig is a modern city with many students, an in-
ternational ﬂair, and an established cultural scene.
You can ﬁnd here many parks and exciting night life.
Leipzig is only about one hour away from Berlin and
three hours away from Prague.
The deadline for application is January 31st. For more
information about the course and how to apply, see:

WORKSHOP April 23-27, 2012 STOCHASTIC
DEMOGRAPHY IN FLUCTUATING ENVIRON-
MENTS: THEORY AND EMPIRICAL PATTERNS
On the occasion of Professor Russell Lande’s award of
the Balzan Prize 2011 for Theoretical Biology or Bioin-
formatics, the Centre for Conservation Biology (CCB)
will organize a workshop in Stochastic demography in
ﬂuctuating environments: theory and empirical pat-
terns April 23-27, 2012. The workshop will be aimed
at young scientists in the initial stages of their scien-
tiﬁc career. The focus will be on models for describing
the demography of populations in ﬂuctuating environ-
ments, methods for estimation of parameters from data
and presentations of empirical examples that illustrate
the practical application of this quantitative approach
for understanding dynamics of populations. Topics that
will be covered are the concepts of demographic and en-
vironmental stochasticity, density-dependence in age-
structured populations, techniques for estimating key
parameters in age-structured models, spatial synchrony
in population ﬂuctuations, population viability analy-
ses and community dynamics.
The workshop will be based on introductory lecturers
by Prof. Steinar Engen, Prof. Russell Lande, Prof.
Bernt-Erik Sæther, Prof. Jarle Tufto and Researcher
Vidar Grøtan. In addition, the participants will present
their own research in short talks, which will be subject
for open discussion. The participants will also be in-
volved in short group exercises on selected topics under
the supervision of researchers at CCB.
The venue will be the island of Lovund at Helgeland
in northern Norway ( http://www.lovund.no/ ). Several
ﬁeld studies (e.g. on house sparrows) run by CCB have
been located in this pristine coastal environment.
Applications. The workshop is primarily aimed at
young ( <37 years old) researchers (e.g. graduate stu-

EnvironmentAdaptation Summer
ANNOUNCING: Summer 2012 REU Opportunities in
The Ecology and Evolution of Changing Environments
at Kansas State University
Kansas State University invites applicants for a 10-week
REU Summer Program. The focus of the program is on
the mechanistic understanding of ecological and evolu-
tionary responses to short- and long-term responses to
changing environments. Research projects will address
biological patterns observed in changing environments
by examining underlying genetic, developmental, phys-
iological, or ecological mechanisms.
The program is hosted by the Ecological Genomics In-
stitute, The Konza Prairie Biological Station, and the
Division of Biology at K-State. Over 30 faculty from
the Division of Biology and Departments of Entomol-
ogy, Geography, and Plant Pathology, will serve as po-
tential mentors. Participants will learn modern ap-
proaches in ecology and evolutionary biology, attend
professional development seminars, travel to important
ecological sites and genomic centers in Kansas and Mis-
souri, and have two opportunities to present their re-
search. The program covers costs of accommodations
and meals. Participants will also receive a generous
10-week stipend.
The deadline for applications is the 1st of March 2012.
More information is available by visiting http://-
www.ksu.edu/reu or by contacting the PIs (Dr. Bruce
A. Snyder and Dr. Theodore J. Morgan) at biolo-
gyreu@ksu.edu.

Learn state-of-the-art genomic methods to identify re-
lationships between the structure and function of mi-
crobial communities. This intensive two-week course
will provide hands-on experience with all aspects of
a metagenomic study. You will formulate hypotheses
and design experiments to test them. You will iso-
late and sequence environmental DNA. You will per-
form computational and statistical analyses to test your
hypotheses. Your system will be an ongoing study of
the eﬀects of land use on the production of the green-
house gas nitrous oxide at the nearby Kellogg Biological
Station Long Term Ecological Research Site ( http://-
lter.kbs.msu.edu ).
Morning lectures will discuss microbial and ecological
principles underlying experiments that you will conduct
during the afternoons. The wet lab sessions will in-
clude puriﬁcation of DNA from soil for clone libraries
and 454 pyrosequencing and for quantitative PCR. In
the computer lab you will analyze your sequences and
metagenomic data with a suite of contemporary pro-
grams to measure community diversity, and use mul-
tivariate analyses to relate community composition to
ecosystem function.
The course will be taught primarily by Drs. Thomas
Schmidt, Jay Lennon and Clegg Waldron of Michigan
State University. Other researchers (from MSU and
elsewhere) will be contributing their expertise in bothlectures and lab sessions.
Who can attend? This course is primarily for graduate
students, postdocs and faculty. Advanced undergrad-
uates and other researchers will be considered. This

Smithsonian PhylogenyEstimation
May20-22
Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to let you know about a workshop and
symposium that we will hold on May 20-22, 2012, at
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The
workshop will provide training in advanced methods for
multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny estimation,
and will take place on May 20 and 21; the symposium
will follow immediately and will feature research pre-
sentations on the same topic. This workshop is funded
by:
US NSF DEB 0733029 Large-scale simultaneous multi-
ple alignment and phylogeny estimation Project Web-
page: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tandy/ATOL-
MSA.html The workshop will include presentations of
new methods for maximum likelihood phylogeny esti-
mation of large sequence alignments (including GARLI
and FastTree), for comparing diﬀerent alignments of
the same dataset, for phylogenetic analyses of datasets
that include partial sequences (e.g., short reads gener-
ated in a metagenomic analysis), for supertree estima-
tion, and for simulating sequence evolution. However,
a main focus is to train participants in both basic and
advanced use of the SAT´ e software (Liu et al. 2009,
Science, Vol. 324, no. 5934, pp. 1561-1564) for simul-
taneous estimation of alignments and trees – software
available for download at
http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/software/sate/sate.html
Workshop participants are expected to bring laptops
with them to the workshop, so that they can perform
alignment and phylogenetic tree estimations. We willprovide test datasets for you to learn how to use SAT´ e,
but strongly encourage you to bring your own datasets
to analyze.
Attendance at the workshop is limited to 40 partici-
pants, and registration is required. If you are inter-
ested in attending the workshop, whether or not you
are requesting travel support, please ﬁll out the Word
document available at
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tandy/workshop-
application.doc, and return it to Laurie Alvarez

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
