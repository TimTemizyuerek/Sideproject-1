Evoluzione 2015 The University of Bologna, the De-
partment of Biological Geological and Environmental
Sciences and the Molecular Zoology Lab (MoZoo Lab)
invite you at the 6th Congress of the Italian Society
of Evolutionary Biology that will be held in Bologna
(Italy) from August 31 to September 3, 2015.
The 6th SIBE congress wants to specically promote
exchanges and discussion among Italian and non-Italian
evolutionary Biologists, with particular attention to
young researchers. Symposia will cover dierent topics,
including the most up-to-date thematic areas of Evo-July 1, 2015 EvolDir 5
lutionary Biology. A paricular attention will also be
given to the dissemination of the nature and social role
of evolutionary biologists to general public.
The Conference is organized into 7 thematic symposia
covering most of the elds of Evolutionary Biology. The
Conference warmly welcomes all professional and non-
professional Evolutionary Biologists, as well as teachers
and science writers. It is also particularly addressed to
young students and scientists and, through an informal
and easy going atmosphere, wants to promote exchanges
and synergies among scientists and/or amateurs.
The Congress venue is conveniently located in the Uni-
versity Area, which is close to the historic part of the
beautiful city of Bologna, the house of the oldest Uni-
veristy in the world.
We hope to see you in all in Bologna

partments or universities in common research, or make
the pathway to publication in journals like SPORA or
LiB easier? Join us at BEER 2015 to kick o an online
network that will be focused on using QUBES Hub to
manage research groups in quantitative and mathemati-
cal biology education and research.
Dates & Location: Friday, October 9, 2015 from 1:30 PM
- 4:30 PM preceding the International Symposium on
Biomathematics and Ecology Education and Research
<https://about.illinoisstate.edu/biomath/beer/Pages/-
default.aspx >meeting at Illinois State University in
Normal, IL.
Description: The Quantitative Undergraduate Biol-
ogy Education Synthesis (QUBES) team sponsors on-
line mentoring networks and an online hub (https://-
qubeshub.org) focused on quantitative biology educa-
tion. QUBES Hub can be used to run a variety of
computational tools in the cloud, for everything from
agent-based modeling simulations in NetLogo to big
data analysis in R. Be one of the rst user groups to see
how QUBES Hub could be used to manage your current
undergraduate research, classroom-based research, or
undergraduate education research agendas. This Faculty
Mentoring Network will begin in-person, then continue
online all semester to facilitate the sharing of resources
and expertise.
Prior to the BEER kick-o meeting, participants will
have the opportunity to review tutorials for QUBES Hub
and begin participating in the online environment. The
network will run from 1 October 2015 to 26 February
2016 and will be hosted online at https://qubeshub.org/-
groups/beer2015 . During the October 9th kick-o, par-
ticipants will develop a plan for integrating QUBES
Hub into their research team. After the in-person meet-
ing, network participants will continue to interact on-
line to rene the workow for their research groups
(classroom-based or undergraduate research), discuss
various implementation challenges, dene strategies to
overcome these challenges, and engage in user experi-
ence feedback for the QUBES Hub team. Participants
will implement during the late fall and/or spring and
share their experiences with each other.6 EvolDir July 1, 2015
This mentoring network is most relevant for faculty who
have already dened research agendas in mathematical
or quantitative biology which incorporate undergradu-
ate students or the scholarship of teaching and learning.
No more than 14 participants will be selected from the
applications. To qualify, participants must identify at
least one current research topic in mathematical or quan-
titative biology, identify at least one quantitative tool
that they use with their students, and must have an
ongoing research collaboration either with an undergrad-
uate student(s) or with another faculty member in the
scholarship of teaching and learning.
We particularly encourage applications from research
groups that involve faculty and students from more than
one college/university.
Participants must also be able to commit ~1 hour per
week to online discussions throughout the span of the
mentoring network dates. Additional time outside of
these discussions will also be required for independent
work on adapting the framework for managing research
online.
Although we are unable to provide travel support, BEER
has its own travel funding opportunities for early-career
faculty. There is no additional cost to participate in the
QUBES Faculty Mentoring Network.
To apply, please go to: https://goo.gl/REgTok. Appli-
cation deadline is June 25th. Accepted applicants will
be notied by July 2th.

The aim of the European Congresses of Mammalogy is
to foster communication between researchers working on
issues of mammalian biology in the European arena, as
well as providing a venue for the broad dissemination of
European mammal research. The relaxed and friendly
atmosphere of these congresses provides an excellent
opportunity to hear the latest developments in various
elds of mammalogy, to share research experience and

Dear Colleagues,
The eld of population genetics has a remarkable tradi-
tion of being a tight-knit and nurturing community. In
order to better foster that sense of community for the
popgen groups in the Midwest, we thought it would be
fun to organize a short scientic conference to which we
could bring our labs and have meaningful introductions
and interactions. After a successful rst trial last year
(Evidence on https://midwestpopgen.wordpress.com/),
we are excited to run this meeting again.
Thus, we'd like to invite you to come and bring your
group to the meeting of the MidWest Population Ge-
netics group, which will be held on July 25-26th at the
University of Michigan. The meeting will begin Satur-
day and continue to Sunday with a BBQ on Saturday
evening.
The keynote speaker will be Goncalo Abecasis, chair
of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. Thir-
teen 25 minute talks will be selected from submitted
abstracts. Students are especially encouraged to attend
and present their work. There will be a small prize for
best poster and best talk by a student or postdoctoral
fellow.
Space is limited, so if you do plan to attend, please
RSVP to szoellne@umich.edu or sign up on http://-
tinyurl.com/kv3vtx4 by June 1, and submit your ab-
stracts by June 1 to dconrad@genetics.wustl.edu so we

Nov9-13
Upcoming Conference on
Re-conceptualizing the Origin of Life
Nov. 9-13 ^th, 2015 at Carnegie Institution of Washing-
ton, Washington D.C.
Physics and chemistry have arrived at a deep under-
standing of the non-living world. Can we expect to
reach similar insights, integrating concepts and quanti-
tative explanation, in biology? Life at its origin should
be particularly amenable to discovery of scientic laws
governing biology, since it marks the point of departure
from a predictable physical/chemical world to the novel12 EvolDir July 1, 2015
and history-dependent living world. This conference
aims to explore ways to build a deeper understanding
of the nature of biology, by focusing on modeling the
origins of life on a suciently abstract level. The confer-
ence will cover a diverse range of topics bearing on the
problem of solving life's origins, starting from prebiotic
conditions on Earth and possibly on other planets and
moving up through the hierarchy of structure in biology
all the way to social complexity. The focus is therefore
on studying the origin of life as part of a larger con-
cern with the origins of organization, including major
transitions in the living state and structure formation
in complex systems science.
Each day of the conference is organized around a dier-
ent integrative theme, kicked o by an invited keynote
presentation. Themes include: information in the living
world, the origin of organization, the self in the world,
re-conceptualizing the nature of the living state, and
an integrated view of the origin and organization of
the biosphere. Keynotes include: Chris Adami (Michi-
gan State U.), Lee Cronin (U. Glasgow), Sara Imari
Walker (Arizona State U.), Eric Smith (ELSI/Sante Fe
Institute) and Douglas Erwin (Smithsonian Institution).
The goal of the conference is to concentrate on integra-
tive conceptual and foundational themes, and not to
review the eld. We hope to facilitate new collabora-
tions and identify specic experimental and theoretical
projects that signicantly advance our understanding of
the origin of life. To maintain a productive workshop-
style atmosphere, the conference is limited to 100 par-
ticipants. Participants must therefore apply to ensure a
space at the meeting. There is no registration fee.
Applications for participation are now open and may
be submitted at: https://easychair.org/conferences/-
?conf=3Dmol20150 We encourage submission of ab-
stracts for the poster session, which will be held through-
out the entire week and will central to fostering lively
discussion. Abstract submissions for poster presenta-
tions are being accepted through Aug. 1st 2015 and
should be submitted at the link above.

Dear Evoldir community:
The 2015 meeting \Mobile Genetic Elements: in silico,
in vitro, in vivo" will take place from Thursday, Septem-
ber 3 to Saturday, September 5 at the Marine Biological
Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA, USA. The meet-
ing will bring together experimental and computational
scientists seeking to narrow the existing gap between the
fast-paced discovery of transposable elements (TEs) in
silico, stimulated by exponential growth of comparative
evolutionary genomic and metagenomics studies, and a
limited number of experimental models amenable to in
vitro and in vivo studies of structural, mechanistic, and
regulatory properties of TEs and their impact on their
prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. It will also feature a
bioinformatics workshop. Special attention will be paid
to the evolutionary aspects of TE-host interactions.
The meeting continues the series of bi-annual regional
meetings held since 2007 in Woods Hole and in Cold
Spring Harbor and will now cover a broader swath of the
continent, following the recent aliation between the
MBL and the University of Chicago. Participants from
any interested US and international labs are welcome.
Half of the talks will be selected from submitted ab-
stracts. We especially encourage abstract submissions
from young scientists at the graduate, postdoctoral,
and early-stage investigator levels, and have allocated
funds for fellowship awards to cover registration costs
for selected presenters, as well as members of under-
represented minority groups.
We look forward to seeing you on Cape Cod in Septem-
ber!

AMU Marseille DrosophilaEvolution
PhD position available in the Prud'homme lab Aix Mar-
seille University (France)
Evolution of egg laying site choice in Drosophila
We are looking for a PhD student to study the evolution
of egg laying site selection in Drosophila. While most
fruities species use decaying plant or fruit substrates to
lay their eggs, some species have evolved a preference for
ripe fruit substrates. One of these species is Drosophila
suzukii, an invasive species that causes severe damage
to the fruit industry in many countries.
The goal of the project is to peer into the genetic and
neuronal mechanisms involved in the selection of egg
laying site in Drosophila, and the changes responsible
for the evolution of this innate behavior in Drosophila
suzukii. The approaches we are using to tackle this ques-
tion include behavioral tests and functional (genetic)
manipulations in an inter-species comparative context.
The project is funded by the A*MIDEX foundation,
supported by the Initiative of Excellence at the Aix-
Marseille University (AMU). The PhD position is funded
for 3 years and should start in September or October
2015. The position is exclusively for students outside
the AMU.
Please send applications, including a motivation let-
ter, a CV, a description of research experience and
interests, and contact information for 2-3 references to:
benjamin.prudhomme@univ-amu.fr
Applicants with a background in Drosophila behavior
/genetics/ chemosensory biology will be considered fa-
vorably.
Our lab is part of the Institute of Developmental Biol-
ogy of Marseille (IBDM), an interdisciplinary research
center studying developmental biology and neurobiol-
ogy. More information about the lab and the institute
can be found here : ( http://www.prudhommelab.com/www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr / )

However, I am open to research projects in other areas
of evolution of sex. I am especially interested in sex
of organisms other than plants and animals, such as
chromalveolates.

ColoradoStateU
EvolutionManagementSystems
A position for a Ph.D. student is available at Colorado
State University. Human societies vary widely in the ap-
proaches used to manage natural resources. The funded
project seeks to address long-standing debates in multi-
ple academic disciplines (e.g., anthropology, geography,
economics, and human behavioral ecology) regarding
what factors shape the subsistence and land tenure sys-
tems used by societies across the globe, and to examine
the evolutionary pathways of these natural resource man-
agement systems. The senior project personnel have, in
recent years, adapted methods originally developed in
biogeography and evolutionary biology to explore the
factors that drive the evolution and geographic patternsof cultural diversity. In addition, the research group
has developed a database that maps cultural features
onto language family trees for over 1400 societies, and
links these to ecological and environmental variables,

uralis has a position for a PhD Candidate, 36 hours
a week PhD project: The genomics of moving hybrid
zones
*About the project* Hybrid zones between species are
recognized as ^Awindows on the evolutionary process ^A
because they provide insights into the nature of species,
species boundaries, introgression and speciation. Com-
paratively little attention has been given to the spatial
dynamics of hybrid zones, how they shift across the
landscape and how movement impacts introgression. In
this PhD project, the candidate will investigate hybrid
zone movement in European large bodied newts of the
genus *Triturus*. Questions to be addressed include:
Is introgression large-scale and unidirectional as mod-
els predict ? Is hybrid zone movement depending on
the landscape ? Can the history of introgression be
reconstructed from the size of the introgressed blocks
of genes ? The project is funded by the Dutch research
organization NWO. The project will be carried out in
international collaboration and the possibility exists to
work at the Shaer Lab at UCLA, Los Angeles, USA,
in one or two sessions for up to eight months.
*General requirements and skills* The successful can-
didate has a Master ^As degree in biology with proven
experience in genomics and in evolutionary biology and,

ImmunityEvolution
The Centre for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial
Model Systems (EEMiS), Linnaeus University, Sweden,
is currently recruiting ve new PhD students in subjects
ranging from marine microbiology to ecoimmunology.
Full details of all ve studentships, with information
on how to apply, can be found at: http://lnu.se/about-
lnu/jobs-and-vacancies?l=en . Applications (in English)should arrive no later than July 31, 2015.
Two of these studentships will be hosted by the Zoonotic
Ecology and Epidemiology Group headed by Prof Jonas
Waldenstr om. Further details of these two PhD posi-
tions are provided below:
|{
POSITION 1
TITLE: Innate immunity of waterfowl - from genes to
function. Reference number: PA 2015/292-2.2.1
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The extent to which natu-
rally occurring polymorphisms in immune genes result in
individual dierences in pathogen susceptibility remains
an open question. While inbreeding has been linked
to increased disease susceptibility in many species, it
is not currently known whether low heterozygosity in
general, or at specic immune loci, is responsible. Beta-
defensins are key eector molecules of the innate immune
repertoire of higher vertebrates, including birds. Their
primary mode of action is the disruption of microbial
membranes. However, they are increasingly recognised
to have multifaceted roles in immune defence. Beta-
defensins represent an ideal system for the study of
host ecoimmunology. Firstly, they have a direct role in
killing invading pathogens, and secondly, the functional
peptide is encoded by a single exon of 36-38 amino acid
residues. These genes thus represent a tractable and bi-
ologically relevant tool for elucidating the genetic basis
for host immunity. The current project aims to build
on knowledge of Beta-defensin allelic variation within
and between wild populations and species in order to
develop an in vitro model for assessing host-pathogen
interactions. Based on allelic proles the student will
compare the bactericidal properties of defensin alleles
in their native conformations. This work may involve
folding and oxidation of native peptides, liquid chro-
matography, structure determination based on NMR
data, and development of bioassays for testing. The suc-
cessful applicant will interact with other students and
researchers within EEMiS, a multidisciplinary centre of
excellence within Linnaeus University that comprises
expertise in ecology, evolution, and microbiology.
|{
POSITION 2
TITLE: Re-addressing Campylobacter jejuni epidemi-
ology and evolution. Reference number: PA 2015/291-
2.2.1
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Campylobacter jejuni is
the most common zoonotic infection in Europe. Despite
a well described epidemiology and targeted interventions
to reduce carriage in food animals (especially poultry),July 1, 2015 EvolDir 19
human campylobacteriosis remains high in Sweden and
the EU. In this doctoral student project, we want to
turn the question of campylobacteriosis around. Instead
of asking how humans become infected, we will investi-
gate what properties that make specic campylobacters
so adapted to their food animal niche. Identifying the
genes responsible to a 'life on the farm' will: (1) enable
a more comprehensive understanding of C. jejuni evolu-
tion, (2) pinpoint which traits that underlie emergence
of new genotypes in food animals and human disease,
and (3) provide new entry points for measures to reduce
C. jejuni carriage in food animals.
A vital part in this line of research is to combine epi-
demiology with phylogenomics where genotypes and
phenotypes of C. jejuni from food producing animals are
contrasted with strains isolated from non-food animal
sources. At our disposal, we have the largest collection
in the world of C. jejuni strains from wild birds which,
together with new strains, will form the basis for gene-
by-gene comparisons with C. jejuni genomes from a
reference strain repository. Based on the genetic studies
the student will set up phenotypic assays, perform ex-
perimental binding studies, and carry out experimental
infections in bird models to test the predictions arising
from the genomic approach. The successful applicant
will interact with other students and researchers within
EEMiS, a multidisciplinary centre of excellence within
Linnaeus University that comprises expertise in ecology,
evolution, and microbiology.

A 3-year PhD position is available in my lab at the Max
Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Ger-
many. This DFG-funded project will study the evolution
of metabolic cross-feeding interactions within bacterial
model communities. Using an approach of experimental
coevolution between members of the same or dierent

impact of genetic relatedness, and (ii) determining the
role of phenotypic heterogeneity during the evolution
of cooperative cross-feeding interactions. By combin-
ing individual-based modelling with detailed analyses
of derived genotypes (whole-genome re-sequencing) and
phenotypes (i.e. microscopic analyses on a single-cell
level, chemical analyses), unprecedented mechanistic
insights into the dynamics that shape the evolution of
cooperative cross-feeding interactions can be gained.
The project is part of the DFG-funded Priority Pro-
gramme Phenotypic Heterogeneity and Sociobiology of
Bacterial Populations (http://spp1617.de) and will be
conducted in close collaboration with other experimental
and theoretical working groups.

Analysing genetic dierentiation to identify genomic
signatures of selection
The rapid development of high throughput sequencing
and genotyping technologies (Next Generation Sequenc-
ing, NGS) permits the comparison of patterns of poly-
morphisms at a very large number of molecular markers,
which allows a detailed characterization of the genomic
regions involved in the adaptation of organisms to their
environment. However, most of the statistical methods
developed so far to identify signatures of selection in the
genomes rely on over-simplied demo-genetic models,July 1, 2015 EvolDir 23
and generally ignore the information brought by linkage
disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers.
The aim of this PhD project is to propose and eval-
uate new model-based methods to identify signatures
of selection using allele frequency data in a Bayesian
framework, along two main axes:
(i) improving the underlying demo-genetic models, by
extending existing approaches based on a migration-
drift equilibrium model (Vitalis et al. 2014), or the
explicit modelling of the divergence history of popula-
tions (Gautier et Vitalis, 2013). An alternative approach
will consist in estimating the correlation structure of
allele frequencies between populations (Guillot et al.,
2014).
(ii) using the information brought by the spatial or-
ganization of markers (LD). This might be achieved,
e.g., by integrating the correlation of gene frequencies at
neighbouring SNPs in the models, using hidden Markov
models or autoregressive models; or by analysing phased
data (obtained by haplotype reconstruction using unsu-
pervised classication techniques) and considering hap-
lotype blocks as multi-allelic loci. These new methods
will be directly applied on NGS (pool-seq) data ob-
tained within the European (BiodivERsA) programme
EXOTIC, which aims at characterizing the genetic bases
of adaptation during the invasion of an iconic species:
the Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Lombaert
et al. 2014). These data, which are already available,
will be used to contrast the genomic characteristics of
native and invasive populations, at a worldwide scale.
We seek a highly motivated candidate with a Master
degree, trained in mathematical modelling and/or bio-
statistics, with a strong interest for evolutionary biol-
ogy and the analysis of data (NGS in particular). A
good knowledge of population genetics principles and
likelihood-based inference techniques will be appreci-
ated. Advanced programming skills in one programming
language (e.g., C, C++, Fortran), and the statistical
software R, are required.
This PhD will be co-supervised by Renaud Vitalis and
Mathieu Gautier, at the Centre of Biology for the Man-
agement of Populations (CBGP), in Montpellier, France.
The application of the new methods developed on the
Harlequin ladybird will benet from a close collabora-
tion with Arnaud Estoup and Benoit Facon.
We invite the interested candidates to send us a detailed
CV, a motivation letter and the e-mail address of one
referee, at: renaud.vitalis@supagro.inra.fr and math-
ieu.gautier@supagro.inra.fr, before July 1st 2015. A
rst selection round will be done based on this informa-
tion, and the successful candidates will be interviewedthrough Skype before July 10th 2015.
Funding: ca. 1 757 euros (gross) per month (for 3 years),
starting October 1st 2015.

Job description
The subject of the PhD project will address the genomic
foundations of cryptic speciation in marine interstitial
invertebrates. The detection of cryptic species is ex-
ponentially increasing in the past two decades. This
includes many interstitial species living in the space
between the sand grains, for which the \Meiofauna para-
dox" is long known. That is, morphological identical
species with very limited dispersal capacities exhibit
a global distribution. The paradox is related to cryp-
tic speciation, but several aspects are unknown. 1)
What is driving speciation? 2) How strongly is gene
ow limited between populations? 3) Does sympatry
of cryptic species occur? 4) Why are the species mor-
phologically static? These questions shall be addressed
using European populations from the interstitial poly-
chaete Stygocapitella subterranea as a model system.
Population and evolutionary genomic approaches will
be explored to assess gene ow, signatures of dierent
selection regimes and phylogeography.

Sweden Macroevolution
Dear colleagues,
Please help us advertise this fully funded PhD position
in Biology to any potential candidates.
The applicant will work on macroevolutionary analyses
of living and extinct taxa. The project, funded through
a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship, aims at identifying
major drivers of speciation and extinction through time
and space. We aim at answering questions such as why
some lineages have produced many more species and
genera than others; how climate change has aected
biodiversity in the past; which regions, biomes and
traits are most closely associated with the evolutionary
success of clades; how clades compete with each other
over evolutionary time; what is the biogeographical his-
tory of particular lineages; and what is the inuence of
phenotypic traits on biogeographical processes.
The project will involve compiling (or generating) and
analysing phylogenetic and fossil data, and potentially
the development of methods aimed at macro evolution-
ary inferences. The details of the project can be adjusted
based on the candidates skills and interests.

Density estimation of lynx during a snowshoe hare peak
and decline
We are seeking a motivated student interested in using
camera trapping to estimate the abundance of lynx in
our study area in the southwestern Yukon. We have
been studying snowshoe hares and lynx at Kluane Lake
for almost 40 years. During much of that time we have
obtained a relative abundance estimate of lynx via win-
ter snow track transects. We are now poised to deploy
camera arrays to estimate actual lynx density changes
during a hare peak and decline. We have good estimates
of snowshoe hares and numbers suggest they will peak
in 2015-16. The successful candidate will be part of an
energetic team (5 professors and 7 graduate students)
studying the lynx-hare cycle. The project will involve
extensive eldwork during autumn and winter meaning
that scholarship (NSERC or equivalent) support will
be necessary. The successful applicant would enroll
at the University of Alberta, Department of Biological
Sciences.
If you enjoy eldwork and want to experience one of
the most beautiful places in Canada during an exciting
time in the hare-lynx cycle, this thesis opportunity is
for you. Work could begin as early as September 2015.
Applicants should provide a CV plus a copy of their tran-

PHD STUDENT POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY
FISH ECOLOGY, 15.6.2015
We announce a four-year graduate student position
(01.09.2015 - 31.08.2019) at the Department of Biology,
University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Joensuu campus
in the Project \Evolutionary restoration of trout popu-lations impacted by human-induced selection", funded
by the Academy of Finland. PhD work will take place
in our new project that is based on a large breeding
experiment, and in which we study the genetic basis of
vulnerability to angling, life-history variation and trait
co-variation (pace-of-life syndromes) especially with re-
spect to migration behaviour in brown trout. The PhD
student is expected to have a background in genetics
and to have basic knowledge on next generation sequenc-
ing techniques and associated bioinformatics methods.
The work will require occasional visits to and a 2-12
month stay at the Department of Biology, University
of Turku, but basic work such as DNA extraction can
be conducted at the local department in Joensuu. The
recruited PhD-student would join an appropriate grad-
uate school of University of Eastern Finland and be
supervised by Dr. Anssi Vainikka (Joensuu), Dr. Silva
Uusi-Heikkil a (Turku) and Prof. Robert Arlinghaus
(Berlin, Germany).
We encourage applications from highly motivated candi-
dates interested in evolutionary genetics, animal person-
ality research and shing/hatchery-induced evolution.
We oer a competitive salary according to the UEF
standards (also based on the candidate's progress, ca.
2000 - 3500 eur / month) the benets of a young, very
productive research group and an international network
of collaborations. Some teaching obligations are in-
cluded in the position (to be negotiated). Four month
trial period is used in the recruitment. Joensuu is a
small (about 75 000 inhabitants) rather international
university town in Eastern Finland, but well connected
through railways and an airport. Joensuu oers a nice
environment especially for a person interested in nature-
related hobbies. Fishing skills are appreciated but by no
means compulsory. Field work is conducted in Kainuu
Fisheries Research station in Paltamo, located 270 km
north from Joensuu.
We expect the successful candidate to be uent in En-
glish, since modern academic research is based on inter-
national collaboration, and all scientic reports (Finnish
PhD thesis consists of 4-5 research articles/manuscripts
and a summary) will be written in English. We require
some demonstrations of good writing skills, and there-
fore ask the applicants to attach a motivation letter
(two pages) describing in English, why would you be a
suitable person for the work, how do you see research
on sh genetics could help to solve sustainability issues
and what are your personal ambitions in science. Please
also analyse your strengths and weaknesses. We do not
expect you to be a PhD during admission phase, but
ready to work hard enough to become a highly qualied
PhD in four years.
Please send your application together with your CV toJuly 1, 2015 EvolDir 29
anssi.vainikka@uef. by 30.7.2015. You can also send
a voluntary recommendation letter separately to the

UmeaU UngulateEvolution
I am advertising a PhD position in animal community
ecology, partly using molecular methods. I think this
position could be of interest for the readers of evoldir.
Joris
The department of Wildlife, Fish & Environmental stud-
ies (SLU, Umea, Sweden) oers a fully funded PhD
project in Animal Community Ecology.
Beyond Moose: community ecology of Sweden's novel
diverse ungulate communities
Project description30 EvolDir July 1, 2015
Sweden's ungulate communities have changed dramat-
ically, resulting from introductions of non-native (e.g.,
fallow deer) and native ungulates (e.g., wild boar) and
expansion of ranges northwards beyond historic distri-
butions due to milder winters. We lack a comprehen-
sive understanding of the functioning of these novel
diverse ungulate communities in landscapes modied
by humans. The Swedish EPA has funded our program
Beyond Moose to increase this understanding and to
move from single- to multispecies wildlife management.
This also feeds into the international discussion on how
to manage increasing ungulate communities throughout
Europe and North America. The PhD will study trophic
interactions among species, and eects on individual
and population performance, for varying ungulate com-
munity compositions and along gradients of land use
practices. The project combines eld methods with
state of the art DNA tools. Results will be crucial for
nding trade-os among competing ecosystem services
such as game meat and recreation from hunting vs. ber
from forests and food from crops. The PhD student
will closely collaborate with an advertised PhD posi-
tion in the Governance project that focuses on social
dimensions of multi-species wildlife management.
Qualications
The applicant should have an MSc degree in Ecology or
similar discipline. We are looking for a candidate that
is prepared to combine extended eld work periods with
work in the lab (DNA analyses) as well as complex data
analyses, such as bioinformatics. Documented skills in
one or more of these three aspects are highly valued.
The candidate should be uent in spoken and written
English. The candidate should be able to work indepen-
dently as well as in a team. Experience in writing and
publishing scientic papers is a plus.
How to apply:
Deadline for applications is 26 ^th July 2015. Preferred
start date is 1 ^st of September 2015. Please use below

CrustaceanEvolution
Genomics of Masculinity in Crustaceans:
Crustaceans are considered ancestral to insects. They
represent a diverse phylum, with unique features such
as the androgenic gland which denes masculinity in
Malacostraca. Applications for PhD positions in evolu-
tionary genetics are invited in the lab of Tomer Ventura
at the University of the Sunshine Coast (Queensland,
Australia). Our group uses an array of bioinformatics ap-
proaches combined with in vitro and in vivo techniques
(including gene silencing), in order to understand the
molecular basis and evolution of sexual dierentiation.
We developed de novo transcriptome assemblies and
assays that enable us to explore the function of specic
genes in masculinity followed by elucidating the evolu-
tionary pathway of these genes, through comparative
phylogenetics.
Prior training in the following areas is highly desirable
but not essential: quantitative or population genetics,
bioinformatics, genomics or evolutionary biology.
Qualications: Applicants require either a Bachelor's
degree with Honours, `Master of Science, MPhil or equiv-
alent degrees. International applicants usually will have
published some work in peer-reviewed journals. Aus-
tralian and New Zealand applicants must have received
rst class Honours degrees. Scholarship schemes at the
University of the Sunshine Coast are highly competitive.
The USC Graduate School website provides further in-
formation on the entry requirements for admission to
the PhD program and scholarship details. Individuals
successful in gaining a tuition-fee waiver scholarship
usually also obtain a living stipend.
*Application process* Interested candidates should send
a cover letter describing their motivation and research
interests along with a CV to tventura@usc.edu.au no
later than Tuesday July 7th 2015. Short-listed candi-
dates will be asked to provide further information and
documentation and will be interviewed over Skype. Fol-
lowing, the nal applicants will be invited to apply for
a PhD at USC.

UWestEngland Biodiversity
We are oering a fully-funded PhD bursary studying
the evolutionary relationships of tropical arthropods
and their ecological interactions with the environment.
Essentially, the student will investigate the link between
biodiversity and ecosystem function in a tropical rain-
forest.
Supervisor: Dr Farnon Ellwood, University of the West
of England Applicants are encouraged to email in ad-
vance of application: farnon.ellwood@uwe.ac.uk http:/-
/people.uwe.ac.uk/Pages/person.aspx?accountname=-
3Dcampus/mdf-ellwood Background: The world is
changing. Climate change and food security are of
increasing concern, while the loss of biodiversity and
ecosystem services are forcing us to question how
ecological communities interact with the physical
environment. Answering this question is becoming
increasingly urgent; we are in a mass extinction crisis
and few theories can predict how communities of species
will respond to environmental disturbance and shifting
weather patterns. Tropical rainforests are particularly
vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance. The student
will spend their rst year studying a model rainforest at
the Eden Project in Cornwall; eldwork in the second
and third years will be based in Malaysia alongside
members of our research group currently taking part
in the Royal Society South East Asia Rainforest
Research Programme. This programme is designed to
facilitate the study of rainforest under dierent levels
of disturbance; the study area is made up of forest
fragments logged in a chronological sequence. The32 EvolDir July 1, 2015
size and shape of each fragment is known, as are the
identities of every tree species.
Aims: The overall aim of the project is to explore
whether functional redundancy (i.e. overlap in ecosys-
tem services) can buer against disturbance-induced
species extinctions. Studies of the link between biodiver-
sity and ecosystem function have yet to show how the
removal of certain species aects nutrient cycling and
the transfer of energy within ecosystems. By studying
the evolutionary relationships of invertebrates against a
background of microbial activity and nutrient stoichiom-
etry (i.e. relationships between the relative quantities
of nutrients cycling through the epiphytes), the student
will show how the nutritional requirements of organisms
shape ecological communities. Moreover, this work will
reveal how disturbing the chemical balance of organ-
isms changes the uxes of elements and energy through
ecosystems. In summary, we will reveal what happens
when environmental disturbance upsets the balance of
nature.
Methods: The student will manipulate physical and
biological conditions within epiphytic bird's nest ferns
(Asplenium nidus), an ecosystem model developed by
us specically for this purpose. Experimental manipula-
tions within the epiphytes will be replicated in habitats
where the ferns occur naturally, and which represent
increasing severities of disturbance: in pristine rainfor-
est; in selectively logged forest of dierent times since
logging; and in oil palm plantations. Bird's nest ferns
are increasingly important as reservoirs of biodiversity
in these progressively degraded habitats. This project
will advance our knowledge in two ways: rst, using
ferns as ecosystem models, the student will manipulate
invertebrate diversity and microclimate within the ferns
and thus quantify the specic impacts of disturbance on
biodiversity and ecosystem function; second, using ferns
as naturally-occurring sampling units, the student will
compare the results from their manipulative experiments
with the genuine eects of large-scale habitat degrada-
tion. The ferns are ideal natural microcosms for this
purpose: they are abundant, widely distributed, easy to
manipulate, and can be sampled thoroughly. Moreover,
the ferns contain suspended soil which not only provides
the fern with nutrients but creates a unique habitat for
a wide range of organisms.
Further details: The studentships consist of an annual
stipend of $14,057. In addition, full-time tuition fees will
be covered for 3 years. Please submit your completed
application to graduateschool@uwe.ac.uk by Monday
29 June 2015. The studentship will start on 1 October
2015 or 1 January 2016.

GenomicSelectionNaturalEnemies
A PhD student position within the EU-funded Marie
Skodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network BINGO
(Breeding Invertebrates for Next Generation Biocon-
trol) is available at the Laboratory of Genetics and the
Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre of Wageningen
University in the Netherlands.
About the position: The candidate will work on the
development of genome-based selection for the improve-
ment of natural enemies in biocontrol. Intraspecic
genetic variation in arthropods is often studied in the
context of evolution and ecology. Such knowledge can
also be very usefully applied for selection of genotypes
with optimal trait values to develop more eective bio-
control agents. For complex life-history or behavioural
traits that lack easily recordable morphological pheno-
types (i.e. longevity, development time, fecundity), the
selection process can be laborious. Knowledge of the
genomic regions underlying the traits can facilitate the
screening and selection process. Genome-based selection
(GS) methods use information from genome-wide DNA-
markers to eciently select for such complex traits.
While they have been shown to hold great potential
for plant and animal breeding, GS methods have not
yet been applied for the improvement of natural ene-
mies. This project seeks proof-of-principle for the use of
genome-based selection for key life history and natural
enemy traits in the model parasitoid wasp Nasonia vit-
ripennis. The aim is to develop selection protocols for
insect natural enemies and apply these for the genome-
based selection of Nasonia lines for complex life-history
traits. The project will involve: (1) A quantitative
genetics approach, known as (genomic selection,) to ac-
commodate the haplodiploid nature of parasitoids and
other natural enemies; (2) Genomic data generation
and analysis using next-generation sequencing technolo-
gies; (3) Large-scale phenotyping of complex traits in
Nasonia. For more details on this position, see http://-bit.ly/1D3tcLT Qualications: We seek a bright, highly
motivated, and enthusiastic researcher with a skill set
suitable to the project and who is able to work both
as part of a team and independently. Our ideal can-
didate has a strong quantitative or statistical genetic
background, experience with bioinformatic analysis, and
life-history or behavioural work in insects. You have a
master degree in quantitative genetics, statistical genet-
ics, animal or plant breeding, or evolutionary biology,
with a good background in population genetics, bioinfor-
matics, genomics or computational biology. Candidates
from other programs, with a strong interest in the ap-
plication of quantitative methods in genetics are also
invited to apply. Experience with NGS technologies and
genomic data analysis is a plus, but training will be
provided. Insect experimental work will be part of the
project. The language in the lab is English. Therefore, a
high standard of spoken and written English is required.
Eligiblity: Candidates must be, at the time of recruit-
ment by the host organisation, in the rst four years
(full-time equivalent) of their research careers and have
not yet been awarded a doctoral degree. This is mea-
sured from the date when they obtained the degree,
which would formally entitle them to embark on a doc-
torate (e.g. Master degree). Eligible candidates may
be of any nationality but must not, at the time of re-
cruitment have resided or carried out their main activity
(work, studies, et cetera) in The Netherlands for more
than 12 months in the 3 last years immediately prior to
the recruitment date.
BINGO-ITN: The BINGO-ITN is funded by the EU
Horizon2020 programme and involves 12 partners from
academia, non-prot organizations, and biocontrol in-
dustry located in the Netherlands, Germany, France,
Spain, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Greece
and Portugal. BINGO's approach is multidisciplinary,
encompassing a broad range of scientic disciplines,
including the application of state-of-the-art popula-
tion genomics. The BINGO programme combines in-
tegrated training workshops and internship opportu-
nities across the network, with career opportunities
in academia, public or the private sectors. You will
work in close cooperation with PhD students and re-
searchers involved in related BINGO research projects.
Secondments are planned to other BINGO participants.

Call SSB Symposia
Reminder: Call for 2016 SSB Symposia
The Society for Systematic Biologists invites proposals
for symposia at the 2016 SSB meeting in Austin, Texasfrom June 17-21st. The meeting will be held jointly
with the American Society of Naturalists (ASN) and
the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE).
Proposals should include (1) a descriptive title, (2) one
or two paragraphs explaining the purpose of the sym-
posium and its relevance to systematics, (3) a list of
presentations including proposed speakers, their institu-
tions or aliations, and their presentation titles, and (4)
an indication of whether the speakers have been invited48 EvolDir July 1, 2015
and whether they have agreed to participate.
Symposia are restricted to half-day sessions (typically 6
half hour talks). The society is particularly interested
in symposia whose topics do not overlap with those
from previous meetings, that introduce new ideas or
synthesize important concepts, or those that are partic-
ularly good examples of the analysis of empirical data.
Proposals that unite systematics with other elds are
also desirable. We encourage participation from young
investigators and others typically under-represented in
symposia. Limited funding is available.
The deadline for full consideration is June 23, 2015.
Proposals should be emailed (Word or PDF for-
mat) to the Program Chairperson, Stacey D. Smith,
stacey.d.smith@colorado.edu. Please use the subject
heading: SSB Symposium Proposal.
The program chair will conrm receipt of submitted
proposals; please inquire if you do not receive email
conrmation. The proposals will be considered by the
SSB Council, and the two selected symposia will receive
funds to partially defer participant costs.

Exploitative Biology positions
If you would like to highlight particularly exploitative
volunteer opportunities, internships, and \work expe-
riences" posted to job boards, there is a new site for
that!
http://crapwildlifevolunteerjobs.tumblr.com/ >From
the about page:
Volunteer 'jobs' that oer no pay are rampant in wildlife
ecology and conservation biology, and it's time for them
to stop. They're unprofessional, exploitative, limit di-
versity, immoral, and in some jurisdictions illegal.
Gas stations don't volunteer their products to run eld
trucks; airlines don't oer up free ights 'for the experi-
ence'. Sta should be paid. No money for salaries = no
sta.
This site isn't about slogging any individual or organi-
zation, but the practice of using volunteers in place of
paid sta. This practice has got to stop. And from timeJuly 1, 2015 EvolDir 49
to time, we come across 'job' adverts that are simply
ridiculous. To highlight the problem and widespread
nature of the practice, submit unpaid jobs in ecology,
wildlife, and conservation and help spread the word.

Long Term DNA storage
Dear Evoldir Community,
Recently in our lab we have been experiencing intermit-
tent problems with long term DNA storage.
The samples causing problems would have been ex-
tracted using a variety of dierent methods, stored at 4
degrees during use and then moved to -20 or -80 degrees
for long term storage. These samples all have good
nanodrop values and have been successfully PCR'ed.
Once the samples are taken out of long term storage
and are nanodropped again the DNA seems to have dis-appeared!!! The samples have been stored in a variety
of plastic ware (dierent types of tubes and plates) all
made from polypropylen. While it is possible that the
DNA is somehow becoming stuck to the plastic, the fact
that the problem is happening so infrequently makes us
think it may be something else.
Thankfully we have managed to recover the samples by
heating and shaking at 60 degrees continuously for ~48
hours, but are puzzled as to why this is happening in
the rst place.
Has anyone else experienced this before or have any
insights into the causes?
Thanks in advance for your help and I will of course
re-post responses,
Nicole Foley

Long Term DNA storage answers
Dear Evoldir Community,
We've had some very interesting responses to our prob-
lem regarding our disappearing DNA. Below, please nd
all responses on the matter and more.
Thanks to everyone for all their help,
Nicole Foley
*Original Query*
Dear Evoldir Community,
Recently in our lab we have been experiencing intermit-
tent problems with long term DNA storage.
The samples causing problems would have been ex-
tracted using a variety of dierent methods, stored at 4
degrees during use and then moved to -20 or -80 degrees
for long term storage. These samples all have good
nanodrop values and have been successfully PCR'ed.
Once the samples are taken out of long term storage
and are nanodropped again the DNA seems to have dis-
appeared!!! The samples have been stored in a variety
of plastic ware (dierent types of tubes and plates) all
made from polypropylen. While it is possible that the50 EvolDir July 1, 2015
DNA is somehow becoming stuck to the plastic, the fact
that the problem is happening so infrequently makes us
think it may be something else.
Thankfully we have managed to recover the samples by
heating and shaking at 60 degrees continuously for ~48
hours, but are puzzled as to why this is happening in
the rst place.
Has anyone else experienced this before or have any
insights into the causes?
Thanks in advance for your help and I will of course
re-post responses,
Nicole Foley
*Responses*
It could simply be that the samples stored below -20C
become insoluble and the DNA tends to crystallize to
the walls of the tube. Thus you cannot pick up any
signal on the nanodrop and when you re-suspend the
DNA you nd it again.
Another cause could be the quality of the buer you are
using and the tubes you store the DNA in.
You could either precipitate the samples and store them
dry or just keep them at 4C - DNA is generally quite
stable.

Hi Nicole
I have seen good DNA go bad but not since I started
using low bind plastic. I use eppendorf lo-bind tubes
and twin.tec plates. The plates are designed for PCR,
but also work ne for DNA template storage. But I
know from others that it is not always the solution.
Sometimes DNA just mysteriously disappears.

My lab has experienced this from time to time with a
small number of samples. In all cases, the DNA had
been stored in water rather than a buer like TE. DNA
eventually denatures in water, especially if dilute. It can
often be (partially) renatured by treatments similar tothe one you used, and this can be facilitated by adding
a small amount of concentrated TE (or that old standby,
SSC) to the denatured DNA sample before heating. It
is less successful if the storage water was acidic (below
pH of about 6.0) to begin with or has become so with
time or upon initial thawing from the freezer.
Our Sanger sequencing facility on campus (like many
others) requires samples to be submitted in water. There
is a temptation therefore to elute our sh DNA samples
from purication columns with water and then store
them that way. If such samples are stored at - 20 or
even -80 C for some time, we encounter the denaturation
problem. So with precious samples we elute withTE (or
with the elution soln. provided by the supplier of the
columns, generally Qiagen or Zymo) and then repurify
an aliquot and elute with water for sequencing.

Dear Nicole Foley,
I would like to share with you my experience: nanodrop
measurements are not very reliable. Sometimes at all. I
dont know how old are your DNAs, however, my DNAs
were PCRable after 4 years of -20 storage (very good
amplication at variable loci).
Another option might be to lyophilisate DNA for long-
term storage and keep it at -20 or - 80 C. Then dilute
when you will need this DNA again. Just an idea.
Nothing really new from my site, perhaps others will
have bigger expertise in DNA storage.
All the best,

Hi Nicole,
How was the DNA extracted and what is it stored in
(e.g. TE, water, etc)? Some extraction methods such as
boiling are good for short term yield, but can damage
the DNA. Similarly some may leave other compounds in
the solution that degrade the DNA. The nal solution it
is stored in is also important as it needs some buering
capacity.

ApeSampleCollection
Volunteer Research Assistant Chimpanzee and Gorilla
genetic sample collection
Hiring Organization: Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Anthropology
Date Posted: 2015-04-06
Position Description: We have one research assistant
position available in Loango National Park, Gabon. We
initiated a project to habituate chimpanzees and western
gorillas in Loango in January 2005. In addition, in 2014,
we started a project to assess group composition and
group dynamics of chimpanzees and gorillas in the study
area. For this, genetic samples have to be collected in a
systematic manner.
We are looking for a person to support the sample col-
lection starting in July 2015, for a one year period. The
assistant's tasks will include: walking recces within grid
cells as part of a team and searching for genetic samples
(feaces) and signs of apes. This will require long hours
in the forest, a lot of walking, a high degree of self-
motivation and reliability. Other tasks include handling
of samples, data entry, chimpanzee habituation and
possible assistance with other projects like phenology,
vegetation surveys and camera traps. Loango National
Park is located on the coast of Gabon and consists of
several ecosystems including coastal forest and swamps.
The living conditions at this project are basic. We have
two main camps, with only basic amenities (no running
water, only minimal solar power for electricity). The
typical day consists of approximately 10 hours walk-
ing in the forest, often through swamps, an average of
12 km per day, rain or shine. The work is physically
demanding.
Qualications/Experience: The applicant must have
at least a BSc in biology, zoology, anthropology or a
related discipline. Previous eld experience with pri-
mates or other animals will be viewed as a great asset.
Basic laboratory skills (like handling a pipette) are ad-
vantageous but not mandatory. The applicant shoulddemonstrate an ability to handle the living conditions
at the site. A minimum knowledge of French is required.
Interested applicants should send a letter of interest,
CV, and names and email addresses of 3 references via
email by June 12 ^th. However, we will be reviewing
applications as they arrive; please don't send repeated
letters of inquiry or telephone calls.
Salary/funding: 150 euros per month to be paid within
Gabon.
Support provided for internship/volunteer positions
(travel, meals, lodging): One round trip airfare to Gabon
and transportation to study site will be provided. Ac-
commodation (a tent) and basic equipment is provided.
Basic food is also provided, but if you want anything
special you need to purchase it yourself. You will be
required to have basic health insurance that also covers
emergency repatriation and liability. You also must have
vaccinations for measles, yellow fever, TB, hepatitis A
and B, polio, and meningitis.
Term of Appointment: 1 year
Application Deadline: June 12 ^th, 2015
Comments: Interested applicants should send a letter of
interest, CV, and names of 3 references (since the dead-
line is tight the can be handed in later in exceptional
cases) to laura hagemann@eva.mpg.de. If you do not
hear from me by June 20th, please assume that you are
not being considered for the position.

Software DISSECT genomeAnalysis
Dear All,
Computational tools are quickly becoming the main
bottleneck to analyse large-scale genomic and genetic
data.
To address this, we have developed DISSECT, a new,
free and user-friendly software that can run on computer
systems that range from simple desktop computers to
large supercomputers. This allows analysing small ge-
nomic datasets as well as datasets containing hundreds
of thousands of records.
Among the things the software can currently do are:
standard GWAS Analysis, Principal Components Anal-
ysis, Fit Univariate and Bivariate Mixed Linear Models
or Genomic Prediction.
Further details on the software and what it can do can
be found at: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/-

Software RpackageLEA
Dear All
We have recently released the R package LEA that en-
ables users to run genome-wide ecological association
studies from the R command line.
Genome-wide ecological association studies aim at de-
tecting allele frequencies that exhibit signicant statis-
tical association with ecological gradients. Ecological
association studies can provide lists of genetic polymor-
phisms that are potentially involved in local adaptation
to environmental conditions through natural selection.
The package LEA runs (very fast) STRUCTURE-like
analyses of population structure, and performs genome
scans for selection from large genomic data sets. It de-
rives advantages from R programming functionalities to
adjust signicance values for multiple testing issues and
to visualize results.
The package is available from the Bioconductor re-
source repository http://www.bioconductor.org. Online
documentations and tutorials are available from the

Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis).
Position 1: Voluntary eld research assistant: 9th of
July to Mid-October (3 months)Position 2: Voluntary laboratory research assistant:
From July onwards for 6 months
Position 1 (Field based):
We are looking for one voluntary eld research assis-
tants to conduct research on the completely subter-
ranean, highly social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys
damarensis). Specically, this project investigates the
group augmentation hypothesis and how benets of liv-
ing in large groups can generate selection for altruism
in animals. We are currently conducting a large scale
capture-mark and recapture experiment running over
one year in which the voluntary research assistant would
play an important role. Field work takes place in the
southern Kalahari, Northern Cape province of South
Africa. Entire groups of mole-rats will be captured and
individually marked. Morphological measurements and
tissue samples will be obtained before the release of the
animals. The work is physically extremely demanding
(long hours, heavy digging to capture mole-rats) and
weather conditions are very challenging (heat during the
day, very cold during the night). Field work will make
trapping during the night necessary. The assistant will
mostly be working along one more experienced scientist
but will need to work independently at times.
Applicants should be enthusiastic, willing to work hard
and keen to get involved in an ecological research project
in the African bush. The research assistants are ex-
pected to be willing to work at night when trapping
schedules require it and need to be t as capturing
mole-rats requires the capacity to do hard physical work
(digging) in a challenging environment. Applicants must
be holders of a driving license. A zoology related degree
and/or previous eld experience will be considered an
asset. The successful applicant will work in a small
team of 2 persons and hence need to be a team player
and generally a person that enjoys collaboration under
sometimes challenging and isolated circumstances.
Position 2 (Laboratory based):
This position entails assisting in a study on hormonal
manipulations of subordinate and dominant mole-rats.
We are interested in the eects of prolactin and testos-
terone on allo-parental care in non-reproducing mole-
rats. The research assistant holding this position will be
involved in all steps of the experiments and will mainly
work in the laboratory with our captive mole-rats which
are housed in large semi-natural tunnel systems. The
responsibilities include behavioural observations, hor-
monal measures (blood sampling, urine sampling) and
hormonal manipulations.
The successful applicant will work in a small team of
5-6 persons. The research station is also the home of54 EvolDir July 1, 2015
several other projects studying meerkats (www.kalahari-
meerkats.com), pied babblers, forktailed drongos, bat-
eared foxes and hornbills resulting in a stimulating sci-
entic environment. Around 20-30 research assistants
are based at the station year round. Research assis-
tants will learn a range of skills such as remote sensing
of behaviour, endocrine sampling techniques, capture-
mark-recapture techniques, behavioural observations,
data handling and management.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants are
paid a monthly allowance to cover their personal costs
and food. Costs for travelling from Johannesburg to the
eld site will be covered.
Applications received until the 8thth of June 2015 are
ensured full consideration. Later applications can be
considered especially for position 2.

Volunteers needed from now onwards as eld assistants
for the project: Reducing Daily Energy Expenditure as
an Adaptive Response to Droughts - Physiology and
Behavior
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to eco-physiology, animal behavior, evolution, and
ecology before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for
long periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part
of a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; all-day observations
in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood samples
are collected for physiological measurements. Volunteers
are expected to help with maintenance of the research
station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1350 (around 180 US$, 110 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$ / 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
several volunteers. Volunteers are expected to stay at
least three months, but longer periods of up to 6months
are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to rrimbach@gmail.com

methods large scale computational biology with a fo-
cus on genetic investigations using genomic information
in combination with large scale phenotyping programs.
The position is part of the strategic research center
\GenSAP" (http://gensap.au.dk) that aims to develop
models and applications for use of computational biol-

Results are implemented in software which is routinelyused at QGG and by several Danish and international
research groups and commercial breeding companies.
Such studies commonly include analysis of very large
stochastic mixed models that require ecient numerical
implementation. In recent years the use of genomic in-
formation, with thousands or millions of genetic markers
per individual, has been increasing and this development

tems used by societies across the globe, and to examine
the evolutionary pathways of these natural resource man-
agement systems. The senior project personnel have, in
recent years, adapted methods originally developed in
biogeography and evolutionary biology to explore the
factors that drive the evolution and geographic patterns
of cultural diversity. In addition, the research group
has developed a database that maps cultural features
onto language family trees for over 1400 societies, and
links these to ecological and environmental variables,
empowering new lines of investigation into drivers of
cultural change. The team is now uniquely positioned
to conduct the rst, integrated empirical tests of theo-
ries regarding the geography and evolution of natural
resource management. The successful candidate will

Phyloinformatics
Post-doctoral position in phyloinformatics
In 2012 and 2013, NESCent sponsored 2 hackathons to
build a prototype \Phylotastic" [1] system with the goal64 EvolDir July 1, 2015
of providing an open, distributed, community-owned
system for ecient delivery of \Tree of Life" knowledge,
so that scientists, educators, and the public can get
online species trees as easily as they currently get on-
line driving directions. NSF recently funded a 3-year
collaborative project [2] to develop a production system
based on this prototype.
As part of this project, a post-doc position is available
with Arlin Stoltzfus at the Institute for Bioscience and
Biotechnology Research (IBBR), a joint NIST-UMD-
UMB institute in Rockville, Maryland, in the midst of a
major biotechnology corridor in the greater Washington,
DC area.
Interested individuals are encouraged to apply for
this position, which provides a unique opportunity to
build tools with a broad impact in spreading phyloge-
netic knowledge (in the scientic community and be-
yond). The successful applicant will become part of
a distributed, collaborative team with colleagues from
IBBR as well as NMSU (Enrico Pontelli), UTK (Brian
O'Meara), Open Tree of Life (Karen Cranston), and
Global Names (Dmitry Mozzherin).
Applications should include * A cover letter (include
skills, suggested start date, and expected PhD date as
needed) * A CV * A short research statement * Contact
information for two references * Link(s) to repositories
with examples of code you have written (or attachments
including such code)
Salary is from 42000 to 46000 USD depending on ex-
perience. The desired applicant is expected to bring a
scientic understanding of phylogeny use-cases into the
design and testing process, and also to participate in
implementation of tools where appropriate. Experience
in scientic programming is required. Understanding
how and why scientists use phylogenies will be extremely
valuable. Knowledge of R or Python (the language of
some of the prototype tools), though helpful, is not nec-
essary. If in doubt, ask: please do not self-select yourself
out from what might be a mutually benecial position.

cation of plants in the Western Ghats mountain system
in India. The duties of the selected candidate will in-
clude some eld work along with collaborators to sampleJuly 1, 2015 EvolDir 65
plants. The major part of the work will involve DNA se-
quencing and phylogenetic analyses. A Junior Research
Fellow will also be part of the project, and will work
under the guidance of the postdoc.
Our lab has ongoing projects on plant evolutionary biol-
ogy, and we would like to begin new experimental work
in this area. I have several ideas in mind. However
the candidate will have plenty of exibility in design-
ing projects, and can involve undergraduate students
& interns. You are welcome to contact me informally
(ullasa@iisertvm.ac.in) for discussions before sending in
your formal application.
SELECTION: The advertisement for the position is at
http://iisertvm.ac.in/openings/read opening/119. The
candidate should have a PhD in biological sciences, and
a good publication record. Experience in phylogenetic
work and familiarity with plant taxonomy will be an
advantage. Independence and willingness to collaborate
with the research group on other projects will be a major
plus - a candidate who can bring in new expertise to
the lab in this area will have a strong advantage.
LIFE IN KERALA AND THIRUVANANTHAPURAM
(TRIVANDRUM): The coastal city of Thiruvanantha-
puram is the capital of Kerala, and has a rich cultural
heritage. It is within a stone's throw away from world-
famous beaches such as Kovalam and Varkala, and lovely
backwater tourism areas such as Poovar. Several hill
stations (e.g Ponmudi) and wildlife sanctuaries are close
by. Being a major medical tourism destination, the city
has excellent medical care facilities.
It is a relatively small city, and the cost of living tends
to be considerably lower than in bigger Indian cities. A
2-bedroom apartment can be had for Rs 8,000 - 10,000
per month. There are plenty of options for dining out
- a meal at a decent local restaurant can start from
Rs 50, but a good meal with a drink even in a ve-
star hotel need not cost more than Rs 1000. Costs for
groceries and other daily needs can be looked up here
(www.kada.in). Taxis can be hired from Rs 10 per km
(with a minimum fare of Rs 50), while the cost of driv-
ing your own small car (not for the faint-hearted!) is
about Rs 5 per kilometer (petrol: Rs 67/litre, diesel: Rs
55/litre).

Lusignan France PlantBreeding
Dear Member,
*Postdoctoral Position in plant breeding methodology
to optimise selection schemes and selection indices for
the improvement of grassland species mixtures at INRA
URP3F (France)*
POSITION DESCRIPTION. The INRA URP3F re-
search unit is seeking for a post-doctoral researcher to
contribute to a collaborative research project (PRAISE)
granted by the ANR 2013 call ^A^ABioadapt ^A^A.
PRAISE is a pluridisciplinary project at the crossroad
of Quantitative and Population Genetics, Ecophysiology
and Functional Ecology. It aims to identify the best
genetic composition of sown grassland mixtures and to
provide the bases of innovative selection methods of
grassland species for their use in mixture. This post-
doctoral research will develop a theoretical analyse of
selection schemes designed to improve grassland species
for their use in mixture and will set up a new selection
index method to reach optimal compromise between
directional selection on some traits and conservation
of diversity on others. Theoretical analyse of selection
schemes for the use of grassland species in mixtures. The
usual selection scheme of grassland species is a recurrent
selection scheme based on the agronomic assessment of
half-sib progenies. Half-sib progenies are usually tested
in pure mono-specic stands although grassland species
are commonly sown in mixtures of several grass and
legume species. However, previous results obtained at
INRA UR P3F suggest that the agronomic value of
genotypes in pure stands correlates quite poorly with
their value in mixtures of two or more species. It is
thus necessary to conceive selection schemes in which
half-sib progenies of a species would be tested in micro-
assemblages with other species. Such selection schemescan be considered as multi-species selection schemes in
which several species would be simultaneously improved.
At each selection cycle, half-sib progenies of a given
species would be tested in factorial micro-assemblages
with other species. Dierent factorial micro-assemblage
designs can be conceived with dierent emphasis on
the general and specic abilities for association in pluri-
specic mixtures (GAA and SAA, respectively). The
post-doctoral research will aim to dene the relative
eciency of several factorial micro-assemblage designs
according to values of GAA and SAA on the basis of the-
oretical expectations of genetic gains. These expected
genetic gains will also be compared to the correlative
response of mixture performance obtained with parallel
classical selection schemes based on the test of pure
stands of half-sib progenies, according to the value of
the correlation of pure stand performances with GAA
and SAA. Finally, eld assays from INRA UR P3F will
provide experimental values of GAA, SAA and of their
correlation with pure stand performances to practically
identify the best selection design. Optimisation of se-
lection indices. The selection methods used in plant
breeding are inherently directional and reduce genetic
variability. They allow maintenance of variability only
for traits genetically unrelated to traits submitted to se-
lection. Usually, the control of selection on several traits
is obtained by choosing candidates to selection based on
the value of an index, i.e. a linear combination of the
estimated breeding values of candidates for traits being
selected. The coecients of the index are determined
using a constraint system based on expectations of ge-
netic gains. The post-doctoral fellow will complete this
constraint system by applying additional constraints
to maintain sucient genetic variance of some traits
and will set up an operational research script to solve
this constraint system. This improved index selection
method will enable to deal with the trade-o between
selection on some traits and conservation of diversity
on others, which is of primary importance to release
improved populations of grassland species for creating
species mixtures able to cope with various environmental
conditions.
REQUIREMENTS. The post-doctoral fellow is ex-
pected to have a background in quantitative genetics,
statistics, applied mathematics and agronomic sciences.
CONDITIONS. The post-doctoral fellow will be
hosted at the INRA URP3F research unit in Lusig-
nan (France) where he will get support from Jean-
Paul Sampoux (responsible of work-package about se-
lection methodology of PRAISE) and Isabelle Litrico

lution of two multigenic families (P450 and terpene
synthases) implicated in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) sec-
ondary metabolism and that show a remarkable expan-
sion in the grapevine genome. The richness of grapevine
metabolism and its potential for giving rise to an excep-
tional diversity of avor compounds contribute greatly
to the aromatic complexity of wine. The goal of the
project is to decipher the evolutionary mechanisms that
led to the expansion of these families, and its poten-
tial link with domestication, performing comparative
analysis between grapevine varieties with dierent aro-
matic properties, domesticated and wild grapevine and
more broadly within dierent species of the Vitaceae
family. This work will extend the integrated approach
used with the stilbene synthases family in Parage et al.

Postdoctoral position in Theoretical Population Genet-
ics
A postdoctoral position in Theoretical Population Ge-
netics is available at the Museum of Natural History in
Berlin. The postdoc will participate in research related
to the Germany-wide Priority Program \Rapid Evolu-
tionary Adaptation" funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG).
The specic project focuses on the role of polygenic
selection in fast adaptation. It involves the mathemat-
ical analysis of a multi-locus model of a quantitative
trait that is subject to stabilizing selection and muta-
tion. We will study the response to selection after an
environmental shift of the trait optimum. Furthermore,
we construct statistical tests to detect the signatures of
polygenic selection in the genome. Our recent publica-
tions on these topics include:
Stephan, W. (accepted): Signatures of positive selection:
from selective sweeps at individual loci to subtle allele
frequency shifts in polygenic adaptation. Molecular
Ecology.
Jain, K. and W. Stephan (2015): Response of polygenic
traits under stabilizing selection and mutation when loci
have unequal eects. G3-Genes Genomes Genetics 5:
1065-1074.
Wollstein, A. and W. Stephan (2014): Adaptive xation
in two-locus models of stabilizing selection and genetic
drift. Genetics 198: 685-697.
Pavlidis, P., D. Metzler, and W. Stephan (2012): Selec-
tive sweeps in multi-locus models of quantitative traits.
Genetics 192: 225-239.
We seek a very highly motivated colleague with a strong
record of accomplishments from her/his PhD work. Ide-
ally, applicants should have a strong background in
population genetics, computational biology and statis-
tics.
The research group of Wolfgang Stephan will relocate
to the Museum of Natural History (MfN) Berlin this
fall. MfN is located in the middle of Berlin on a vibrant
campus of bioscience institutes of the Humboldt Univer-
sity and various other institutions with a broad interest
in evolutionary and theoretical biology.
The postdoc will receive a salary according to the Ger-man pay scale (100% E13 TV-L). Interested candidates
should send a CV, statement of interest, and contact
information of three potential referees as a single PDF
le to Prof. Wolfgang Stephan (stephan@bio.lmu.de).

Tokyo 10 OriginOfLife
*Postdoctoral fellowships in interdisciplinary research
relating to origins of life, spending 50% of time in Tokyo,
Japan*
The ELSI Origins Network (EON) announces the avail-
ability of post-doctoral research fellowships for researchrelated to the Origins of Life. Ten two-year positions will
be funded, to take place within the period 2016-2018.
Successful candidates will split their time between the
Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) in Tokyo and an-
other institution of the candidates choice, anywhere in
the world. The fellowship will pay a salary for two years,
which covers the time spent at both locations, as well
as a generous research budget. The positions will start
on or before 1st April 2016.
EON (eon.elsi.jp) is an interdisciplinary international
network which seeks to foster dialogue and collabora-
tion within the Origins of Life community to articulate
and answer fundamental questions about the nature
and the reasons for the existence of life on Earth, and
possibly elsewhere in the Universe. Its goal is to bring
together leading-edge research in all areas of the physi-
cal, mathematical, computational, and life sciences that
bears on the emergence of life. ELSI is chartered as a
Japanese World Premier International Research Center,
to study the origin of Earth-like planets and the origin
of life as inter-related phenomena. ELSI is located at
the Ookayama campus of Tokyo Institute of Technology.
EON-supported research addresses three overarching
questions:
1. How did life emerge on Earth?
2. How common is life in the universe?
3. What fundamental principles explain the emergence
of life?
Due to the split-time nature of these fellowships, the
application process requires the applicant to choose a
supervisor and host institution outside ELSI who will
support the proposal. EON is designed to promote
collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, and host
institutions in all elds are welcome.
The goal of the fellowships is cross-fertilization between
specialists in Origin of Life research around the world,
with a central collaborative hub at ELSI. EON aims
to build a research community in which postdoctoral
fellows benet from facilities not only at ELSI but also
among the centers throughout the network.
The rst deadline for applications is August 1st 2015,
with a second deadline on 1st October to ll any remain-
ing places. Please check our web site for more details,
including the application procedure.
Details of the fellowships are as follows, with further
details available on our web site.

Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Associate
position at the University of Maryland Institute for
Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR).
Position Summary
Because species phylogenies (trees) are so widely used
in the life sciences, there has been a major worldwide
eort to determine trees for various groups and assemble
them into a grand \Tree of Life" or ToL. While experts
continue improving the ToL, our focus is on getting this
knowledge into the hands of scientists, educators, and
the general public, so that they can get online species
trees as easily as they get online driving directions. In
preliminary work, we organized community hackathons
at which participants prototyped a web-services system,
called \Phylotastic" (www.phylotastic.org), that aims to
provide an open, distributed, community-owned system
for ecient delivery of ToL knowledge. NSF recently
funded a 3-year collaborative project to develop produc-
tion system based on this prototype. Responsibilities
will include participating in the design process, devel-
oping tools for specic use-cases (including educational
ones), and playing a key role in software evaluation.
The successful applicant will be part of a distributed,
collaborative team including key personnel from IBBR,
NMSU, UTK, OpenTree and GlobalNames.
Qualications:
A Ph.D. in a relevant discipline is required. Understand-
ing how and why scientists use phylogenies is critical.
Typically this knowledge will come from research experi-
ence using phylogenies. Experience in scientic softwareprogramming is strongly preferred. Experience pro-
gramming with phylogenies, or with web services, is
desirable.
Salary: Commensurate with qualications.
Applications: Applicants should send a (1) cover let-

*LAST CALL for a Postdoctoral bioinformatician in
Evolutionary genomics, UNamur, BE*
A 3-year postdoctoral bioinformatician position is avail-
able to work on the genome evolution of bdelloid rotifers
within the group of Prof. Karine Van Doninck (Lab-
oratory of Evolutionary Genetics and Ecology) at the
University of Namur (Belgium). The postdoctoral re-
searcher will work on two projects, funded by ARC and
FNRS-MIS, with as main objective to investigate the
origin and causes of the genomic peculiarities found in
the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga.
Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) we previously
characterized the degenerate tetraploid genome struc-
ture of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga with massive
genomic rearrangements involving most of the longest
scaolds. As a consequence, no homologous pair of chro-
mosomes could be identied within this genome pro-
viding the rst genomic hallmark of ameiotic evolution
within this bdelloid rotifer clade. Another peculiarity
observed in the genome of A. vaga is the high percentage
of genes (8%) of non-metazoan origin and probably ac-
quired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (see Flot
et al Nature 2013). These features could be conferred
by their long-term ameiotic evolution. Nonetheless, the
unusual lifestyle of many bdelloid rotifers, involving re-
peated cycles of desiccation and the associated DNA
DSBs (see Hespeels et al JEB 2014), may also contribute
to genome structure evolution. In order to determine
the origin and causes of these genomic peculiarities we
are starting a comparative analysis of genomes of dif-
ferent bdelloid species that diverged a long time ago,
including lineages that have lost the ability to withstand
desiccation, and of an A. vaga clone submitted to sev-
eral rounds of desiccation. The postdoc will conduct
bioinformatic analyses of genomic (and transcriptomic)
data being generated.
The current team of researchers working on bdelloid
rotifers within the 2 projects include 3 Principal Inves-
tigators (Prof. K. Van Doninck and Dr. F. Chainiaux
from UNamur and Prof. B. Hallet from UCL), 2 post-
doctoral researchers, 3 PhD students, 2 Master students
and 2 technicians.

UOulu Bioinformatics
The Faculty of Humanities of the University of Oulu, Fin-
land, announces a three-year Postdoctoral Researcher
Position in bioarcheological research community to start
at 1 September 2015.
Description
Bioarchaeological research community (BARC) at Uni-
versity of Oulu, Finland, is looking for a talented and
research-oriented postdoctoral researcher. This posi-
tion is for three years. The postdoctoral researcher is
expected to make a contribution to multidisciplinary
research of this research community by bringing in ex-
pertise in biomolecular research, more specically bioin-
formatics and computational genomics.
BARC examines the eects of environmental and cul-
tural changes on both humans and animals in northern
Europe focusing on Finland and neighboring regions.
The eects of neolithization, modernization and urban-
ization are under particularly close scrutiny. The main
study materials include archaeological materials (biolog-
ical and non-biological materials), museum collections
and clinical samples. A broad range of methods and
techniques are thus utilized from those used in archae-
ological and historical research to those used in bone
imaging and biomolecular research. Due to this multi-
disciplinary research, this research community includes
four research teams divided between three faculties. The
four research teams are as follows:
The Post-Pleistocene Evolution of Human Skeleton (Do-
cent Markku Niskanen, Archaeology, Faculty of Human-ities) utilizes osteometric and bone imaging techniques
to examine temporal and geographic variation in human
body size, body shape and skeletal robusticity and how
these are related to environmental and cultural changes.
Bioarchaeology of human-animal interactions: biomolec-
ular and osteoarchaeological analyses of human and
animal bones (Prof. Jouni Aspi, Biology, Faculty of
Science) explores human-animal relationships through
ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotope and osteological
analyses.
Material culture and the modernization of the north (Dr.
Timo Ylimaunu, Archaeology, Faculty of Humanities)
examines the development of society from the medieval
period to the present. The focus is on examining the
dynamics of modernization, globalization and consump-
tion processes and human-environmental relationship
in Northern Fennoscandia as a part of the globalizing
world.
Human Biology and Comparative Anatomy (Prof. Juha
Tuukkanen, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of
Medicine) concentrates on functional relationship in
morphology between temporally distinct populations.
The main research focus is temporal trends in overall
skeletal morphology, bone microstructure and biome-
chanical properties.
The postdoctoral researcher is expected to carry out
research and participate in publishing research results
in peer-reviewed journals, and to co-supervise students.
It is our hope that this position would help the post-
doctoral researcher to develop his/her own scientic
networks through research collaboration, and that this
position would be a step towards a position as a more se-
nior and independent researcher able to develop his/her
own projects.
This position will be ocially based at the Faculty of Hu-
manities, University of Oulu, Finland. In practice, the
postdoctoral researcher would work in facilities, which
best suit his/her actual work for the BARC.
Qualications
The candidate must have earned his/her doctorate no
more than seven years before the application deadline.
This doctoral degree should be in biological anthropol-
ogy, biology, biomedicine, archaeology (mainly biomolec-
ular archaeology) or a related eld. In addition, he/she
should have a record of scientic achievements (e.g.
peer-review publications). International mobility and
experience of teaching and/or academic supervision are
advantages. In addition, we appreciate ability for inde-
pendent research, high motivation and eciency, as well
as ability to co-operate and work as a research team
member.82 EvolDir July 1, 2015
We are searching for a researcher, who is familiar with
bioinformatics and computational genomics. Previous
experience in handling NGS data using scripts and anal-
ysis pipelines is desirable. Other highly useful skills
and/or experiences include computer programming, pop-
ulation genetics, wet lab analysis, genome assembly and
annotation.
Salary
The salary of the postdoctoral researcher will be set on
levels 5 ^AV6 of the national salary scale for the teaching
and research sta of Finnish universities. In addition,
supplementary remuneration will be given for personal
achievement and performance, the sum rising to a maxi-
mum of 46.3% of the salary scale. In practice, the salary
will be about 3300 ^AV 4000 euro at the start of the
period.
Applications
Applications, including any attachments, should be sub-
mitted using the electronic application form by 31 July
2015.

bicourses/PGDH15/ Course description Genetic data
are increasingly used by ecologists and evolutionary bi-
ologists in general. It has thus become important for
many biologists with dierent levels of experience to
produce and analyse genetic (and genomic) data. In
this course we will take a practical approach to the
analysis of genetic data, but we will also provide some
of the theoretical background required to understand
the outputs of the software used. This course will be
organised so as to mix lectures where important notions
are introduced with practicals where freely available
software will be used. While this will not be the focus of
the course, we will also introduce and discuss genealog-
ical (coalescent-based) simulation methods and those
based on forward-in-time simulations. Altogether this92 EvolDir July 1, 2015
will allow to discuss the potentialities and limitations
of the tools available to the community.
In this four-day course we will introduce the main con-
cepts that underlie many of the models that are fre-
quently used in population genetics. We will focus on
the importance of demographic history (e.g. eective
sizes and migration patterns) in shaping genetic data.
We will go through the basic notions that are central to
population genetics, insisting particularly on the statis-
tics used to measure genetic diversity and population
dierentiation. The course will also cover a short in-
troduction to coalescent theory, Bayesian inference in
population genetics and data simulation, as they are
connected to what makes landscape genetics today on
the basis of multilocus data. We will also introduce two
methods that have been recently developed to analyse
genomic data. The PSMC of Li and Durbin reconstructs
the demographic history of a species or population with
the genome of a single individual. The Rehh package
is an R implementation of the Extended Haplotype Ho-
mozygosity (EHH) test for selective sweeps and looks
for signals of selection based on the analysis of genomic
regions.
Most theory will be put into practice in practical ses-
sions, analyzing real and/or simulated datasets. In these
sessions, we will look at measures of genetic diversity
and dierentiation and use methods to detect population
structure as implemented in the program STRUCTURE
and discuss related programs such as FastSTRUCTURE.
We will learn how to perform coalescent simulations of
genetic data (using SPAms and ms). Some exercises
will make use of R scripts (R being a freely available sta-
tistical program). Basic R knowledge is a pre-requisite
but we will provide a short introduction to R. The R
statistical package is a very powerful tool to analyse
data outputs from many population genetics software,
and can also be used to simulate genetic data under
simple demographic scenarios.

Dear PhD students and PostDocs,
we seek six highly motivated young researchers to ac-
tively contribute to two workshops on the topic Towards
a general theory of the pace-of-life syndrome, which
will take place in Hannover (Germany) from October
14 to 16, 2015 and July 13 to 16, 2016. The workshops
are fully funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (Ref:
89905).
With these workshops will revisit a broad heuristic con-
cept suggesting that life-history characteristics, among-
individual dierences in behaviour (i.e. personality)
and a suite of physiological traits have coevolved in
response to environmental conditions forming the pace-
of-life syndrome (POLS). This concept has generated
much research interest because it provides an extraor-
dinary opportunity for organismal biologists to extend
fundamental principles of life-history theory to a whole
set of ecologically relevant physiological and behavioural
traits. However, we still lack a general theory explaining
the (co)evolution and maintenance of links between life-
history, physiological and behavioural traits in a general
ecological framework as well as specic models predict-
ing links between multiple traits at the dierent levels
of variation (i.e. individual, population, species). In the
workshops we will unite the expertise of 40 empiricists
from various elds (behaviour, ecology, evolutionary
biology, psychologists) and theoreticians to intensively
work at the development of a general theory of the pace-
of-life syndrome. We aim at (1) rening the general
theoretical concept, (2) building specic quantitative
models, (3) developing guidelines on study design and
statistical analyses for empiricists, (4) initiating the cre-
ation of a public data base containing information on
life-history, physiology and behaviour of species and pop-
ulations in various ecological conditions, (5) using this
date base to run comparative analyses to test the eect
of broad-scale environmental conditions on covariation
of the POLS traits, and (6) exploring the predictive
potential of the POLS for species range shifts as a result
of global change.
If you are interested to actively participate in these two
workshops, please send a CV and a letter of motivation,
explaining why you think the workshop will be interest-
ing for you and how you can contribute to the specicJuly 1, 2015 EvolDir 93

Dear colleagues
I am pleased to announce this year's morphometrics
course from the University of Manchester. This year's
course will run in the six weeks from 2 November to 11
December 2015.
The course information can be found on the following
we site: http://www.ywings.org.uk/MorphoCourse
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Denitions
of size and shape * Geometric methods to characterise
shape from a conguration of landmark points (Pro-
crustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation, scatter
plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal component
analysis * Measurement error and outliers * Shape trans-
formations and 'warping' { the thin plate spline * Anal-
ysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing between groups
(taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) * Allometry and
size correction * Inuence of external factors on shape
(ecomorphology, dose-response studies) * Symmetric
forms and measurement of asymmetry. * Morphometric
inferences on developmental processes * Morphological
integration and modularity * Genetics of shape: analy-
ses of resemblance between relatives, QTL analyses. *
Phylogeny: reconstructing the evolution of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.

EvolutionTreeInvasion Nov9-10
The Centre of Invasion Biology (CIB) is pleased to
announce its international workshop \Evolutionary dy-
namics of tree invasions: drivers, dimensions, and impli-
cations for management" that will be held between 9th
and 10th November 2015 in Stellenbosch, South Africa.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
An extensive body of research suggests that invasive
plant populations often undergo phenotypic and ecologi-
cal divergence from their native sources. These changes
can result due to selective pressures in the new range or
through demographic stochasticity during introduction.
Given the life-history traits of trees that gives them
long lifespans and generation times, it is not surprising
that the evolutionary dynamics of invasive trees are still
comparatively poorly understood and that their inva-
sion potential has been often underestimated. Invasive
trees have signicant impacts worldwide and these are
increasing rapidly in many parts of the world.
Several cases are known where invasive tree populations
show dierences in morphological or physiological traitsor altered ecological interactions (e.g. mutualistic re-
lationships) compared to their native sources. Despite
such evidence, the understanding of the drivers and the
extent of these changes remains sketchy compared to
other plant forms, such as annual herbs.
The rst aim of this workshop is to synthesize our cur-
rent knowledge on the key processes underlying tree
invasions worldwide by investigating the role of dier-
ent potential drivers, including pre-adaptation, articial
selection/selective breeding, polyploidy, hybridization,
reduced enemy pressure, new mutualistic interactions,
and novel selection pressures, in facilitating evolutionary
change. A second aim is to elucidate the dimensions
of these processes to better understand across which
temporal, spatial and taxonomic scales such changes
can occur. This includes, for example, ndings on how
certain drivers are represented across dierent taxa,
how rapidly divergence from native sources can develop
and/or if a species invasion success across wide geo-
graphical ranges can be the result of dierent drivers.
Further, we aim to explore how such processes may bias
management and control approaches and how research
could reduce such biases, thereby increasing our general
knowledge of, and ability to manage, tree invasions.

will discuss a particular theme together with one of
the invited speakers. The results of these small-group
sessions willl be presented to the plenum by student
participants, followed by a general discussion.
Adaptive decision making depends on the quality of
available information. The signicance of direct or in-
direct information involved in social decisions is little
understood. Evidence for constraints and substantial
costs in the acquisition and processing of information is
accumulating. Accordingly, behavioural decisions often
seem to be made with imperfect knowledge, following
\rules of thumb" rather than applying prudent assessment
to make optimal choices. Furthermore, individuals may
or may not benet from sharing information; hence they
may transmit only partial or false information. The aim
of this workshop is to discuss these issues in an evolution-
ary framework, both from an empirical and theoretical
perspective. Questions discussed in this workshop will
include, for instance, how dierent costs of information
acquisition and use will change predictions on adaptive
decision making; or, whether seemingly irrational or
\wrong" decisions may actually make sense when taking
costs and constraints on information use into account.
These are topics of great interest to students and sci-
entists from dierent disciplines, such as behavioural
ecology, neurobiology, cognitive sciences, and psychology.
Interaction between dierent elds will identify open
questions and directions for future interdisciplinary re-
search.

International Workshop \An Introduction to Geometric
Morphometrics using R"
October 5-9, 2015 @ CIBIO-InBIO, Vairao, Portugal
The analysis of organismal shape is central to many
questions in ecology and evolution. This workshop aims
at providing an introduction to the theory and meth-
ods of geometric morphometrics for analyzing variation
in shape and its covariation with other variables. It
will provide an overview of the theory underlying the
quantication of shape using landmark methods, and
a practical guide to data acquisition, standardization
for obtaining shape variables, statistical treatment of
shape variation, and visualization of the results in the
R language for statistical programming.
R knowledge is a requirement for the course and it will
be assumed that all participants are uent for data ma-
nipulation and basic operations in the R environment.

Wageningen GbyEInteraction
Oct19-23
In October (19-23), the Animal Breeding and Genomics
Centre of Wageningen UR, ABGC, is organizing a PhD-
course on genotype by environment interaction, unifor-
mity and stability. We will focus on quantitative genetics
and statistical modeling from a broad perspective: ani-
mal breeding, plant breeding and natural populations.
This course will be given on the Wageningen Campus.
Maximum number of participants is 40; the minimum is
15. The registration deadline is September 30th. Note
that registration is not nal until you have received
conrmation from the course organizers that you can
participate.
Course Details:
Genotype by environment interaction, uniformity and
stability
Dates : 19 to 23 October 2015Teachers : Han Mulder, Piter Bijma, Marcos Malossetti
and Phillip Gienapp
Credits : 1.5 ECTS
Minimum participants: 15 Maximum participants: 40
Final Registration date: September 30, 2015
Provisional day-to-day program:
Monday: Genotype by environment interaction: con-
cepts and implications
Tuesday: Statistical modeling of genotype by environ-
ment interaction in animal and plant breeding
Wednesday: Quantitative genetics of variability
Thursday: Statistical modeling of variability and stabil-
ity
Friday: Costs and benets of stability, plasticity and
uniformity (until 12.00h)

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), butJuly 1, 2015 EvolDir 99
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
