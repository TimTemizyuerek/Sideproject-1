Cleveland ASN
SymposiumProposalCall 2022
The American Society of Naturalists
Proposals for a Symposium to be held at the 2022
SSE/ASN/SSB Meeting in Cleveland, OH
Due October 15th, 2021
The American Society of Naturalists invites proposals
for a special symposium at the 2022 annual joint meeting
of the Society for the Study of Evolution, the American
Society of Naturalists, and the Society of Systematic
Biologists, to be held June 24-28, 2022, in Cleveland,
OH.
Proposed symposium topics should support the Soci-
ety's goal to advance the conceptual unication of the
biological sciences and to further knowledge in evolution,
ecology, behavior, and organismal biology. Proposals
should be synthetic and interdisciplinary and address
important emerging issues in evolution, ecology, or be-
havior. A budget of $8,000 for travel, registration, and
accommodation is provided to help defray expenses.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (one page); (3) a list of six speak-
ers, including institutional aliations, who have agreed
to participate in the symposium; (4) a justication for
the symposium, explaining why the topic and speakers
are appropriate for a Society-sponsored symposium (up
to one page).
Please submit proposals no later than midnight
Eastern Time on October 15, 2021, by email (we-
berm11@msu.edu) as a single pdf attachment, under
subject heading: ASN Symposium Proposal: Evolution
2022. In line with the ASN's commitment to diversity,we encourage including speakers from groups who have
been historically excluded from STEM. Therefore, pro-
posals that include a diverse list of speakers from a range
of backgrounds, institutions, career stages, geography,
gender, race etc. are especially encouraged.
The Society's selection committee will evaluate propos-
als based on the likelihood of attracting a substantial
audience, the signicance and timeliness of the topic,
and on the topic's diering substantively from recent
symposia hosted by the Society. All applicants will be
notied of the decision before the end of November.

Online AnimalBehaviour Nov18-19
Dear colleagues,
We are thrilled to announce the Animal Behaviour Live:
Annual Online Conference 2021 that will take place on
the 18th and 19th of November 2021. Like the previ-
ous version, this conference will be fully broadcasted
online on YouTube and is aimed at inclusively bringing
together researchers in animal behaviour from all over
the world. Like last year, the event will be completely
FREE of charge and open to everyone.
We already have two conrmed plenary speakers: Prof.
Marie E Herberstein who studies the behavioural ecol-
ogy of spiders and insects, and Prof. Rebecca Kilner
who studies the relationship between social behaviour
and evolution in birds and insects.October 1, 2021 EvolDir 3
Based on our previous edition, we have implemented
some changes to make ABL:AOC 2021 even more acces-
sible. The main one is a new presentation session every
day for a better coverage of global time zones. Thus,
the congress will be divided in 6 sessions (3 sessions per
day):
* Session 1: 7h-10h UTC+0 * Session 2: 14h-17h UTC+0
* Session 3: 21h-24h UTC+0
Over these dierent sessions, you will be able to attend
4 plenaries and 24 short presentations, as well as other
little surprises. In parallel, it will also be possible to
watch a series of posters during the whole congress.
The short presentations will be for 20 min (15 min talk +
5 min questions). This year, two options will be oered
to the speaker: 1) Record the 15 min presentation (and
we will stream the video) 2) Present live. In both cases,
the 5 minutes of questions will be held live to allow for
interactions with the attendees.
The posters will keep the same format as last
year, namely a pre-recorded 5 min presentation.
You can nd a lot of dierent examples on our
YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/-

Online Palaeobiology Dec1-15
Dear colleagues,
we are thrilled to announce the Thematic Session
\Conservation Palaeobiology - Bridging Past and Fu-
ture" at the 3rd Palaeontological Virtual Confer-
ence, that will take place from the 1st to the
15th of December! The direct link to the session
page is http://palaeovc.org/index.php/conservation-
paleobiology-bridging-past-and-future/ Conservation
paleobiology is an emerging eld that applies data, con-
cepts, and theories from diverse disciplines, including
paleontology, geology, and paleoecology, with the pur-
pose of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem man-
agement. Currently, humanity is facing grave conse-
quences from rapid climate change, pollution, biosphere
alteration, and species extinctions. However, direct
ecological observations of anthropogenic impacts and
environmental change rarely span more than the last
few decades. To understand more fully how ecosystems
have responded to multiple stressors through time we
need to seek answers in the past. Geohistorical records
can help overcome the temporal limitations of tradi-
tional ecological monitoring. They provide insights into
ecosystem changes and biotic responses to major en-
vironmental perturbations over long timescales, thusOctober 1, 2021 EvolDir 5
facilitating reconstructions of past ranges of variability
and supporting the theoretical foundations of future
conservation eorts.
This session is supported by the Conservation Paleobi-
ology Network (https://conservationpaleorcn.org/) and
co-chaired by Paolo Abondio (Dept. Biological, Geolog-
ical & Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna,
Italy), Danijela Dimitrijevi ~A (GeoZentrum Nordbay-
ern, FAU Erlangen-N urnberg, Germany) and Niklas
Hohmann (GeoZentrum Nordbayern, FAU Erlangen-
N urnberg, Germany).
We invite contributions from paleontology and related
elds including (but not limited to) archaeology, an-
thropology, and historical ecology. We are particularly
open to submissions on the topics of near-time and
deep-time perspectives on eco-evolutionary processes
during episodes of rapid (natural and anthropogenic)
environmental change and potential biases aecting the
fossil record. In addition, we encourage submissions
on collaborations with practitioners and conservation
eorts that use historical data.
We hope to gather exciting and thought-provoking con-
tributions that will stimulate discussions between sci-
entic disciplines and practitioners around urgent ques-
tions in conservation paleobiology.
There is a registration fee of 5 euro (social funds are
available for participants from low and lower-middle
income countries) for the whole virtual conference, and
the possibility to submit up to two abstracts (of 250
words each) as rst author in any of the thematic ses-
sions of PalaeoVC. Abstract deadline is September 20th;
formats for accepted communications will be slide pre-
sentations (5 to 30 slides) and videos (12 minutes), while
discussions will be carried out on Discord.
You can nd all the information you need at http://-
palaeovc.org/ . Please, do not hesitate to spread the
word around you by forwarding this e-mail to as many
colleagues as possible, and publishing the event on social
media!

Evolution & physiological genomics
The Dolby and Kusumi labs in the School of Life Sciences
at Arizona State University have funding to support
a PhD student in the area of evolutionary, physiolog-
ical, and functional genomics. The main project will
focus on modeling the genomic, epigenomic, transcrip-
tomic, and behavioral controls on an adaptive phenotype
(drought-tolerance) in snakes using empirical data (NSF
#2107975, https://tinyurl.com/rkwxmrcv). Prior expe-
rience is not required, but enthusiasm to learn modeling
(e.g., structural equation modeling) and bioinformatic
(CLI, R) tools is essential. Broadly, our group uses
interdisciplinary approaches to answer questions about
the mechanisms of evolution, such as under what lim-
its geological/climatic processes shape the formation of
species, or how are adaptive phenotypes controlled and
evolved during the process of speciation. Applicants
are welcome from a wide range of disciplines, including
mathematics, earth sciences, physics, computer science,
and biology.
Our group is a supportive, dynamic, integrative re-
search team with a strong commitment to inclusive
practices. For more information visit our lab websites:
www.greerdolby.org and https://kusumi.lab.asu.edu. If
you are interested in this research and applying to grad-
uate school at Arizona State University, please email

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Wheat is one of the most
important crops globally, forming a crucial part of hu-
man diet. Bread wheat has a polyploid genome result-
ing from ancient hybridization between its diploid and
tetraploid progenitors some 10K years ago. Understand-
ing the genetic consequences of polyploidization on the
wheat genome, transcriptome, and ultimately pheno-
type, can have crucial implications for utilization of
genetic diversity in breeding. The seminal polyploidiza-
tion of bread wheat evolution can be recreated in ex-
perimental settings, producing synthetic/nascent poly-
ploids, which are not simply a sum total of the parental
genomes, but are modied by various genetic and epige-
netic changes, including sequence elimination, transcrip-
tomic changes and epigenetic modications. Although
some of these changes are reproducible and similar to the
ones found in natural polyploid wheats, their systematic,genome-wide characterisation is lacking. Moreover, the
mechanistic basis of these changes remains poorly under-
stood, and it is unclear whether they are necessary for
proper functioning and fertility of the nascent polyploids,
or mere (potentially deleterious) byproducts of the poly-
ploidization process. The best described consequence
of polyploidization in wheat is the re-programming of
its transcriptome, also called expression partitioning.
Transcriptomic studies have shown that homoeolog si-
lencing is pervasive in bread wheat, with 27.6%-45%
of homoeologous groups having one or two gene copies
silenced. A portion of these changes is established im-
mediately after polyploidization and can be studied
in synthetic allohexploids. Although there are several
possibilities how transcriptional reprogramming can be
achieved (e.g., gene loss, TE insertion in gene's vicinity;
position eect due to translocation), mounting evidence
suggests that DNA methylation (i.e. cytosine methyla-
tion) is the primary mechanism of polyploidy-induced
reprogramming that ensures its heritability. Despite the
obvious importance of gene expression (de)regulation
in polyploid crops, virtually no studies have examined
on the genome-wide scale the possible links between
gene expression changes and DNA methylation patterns
in nascent wheat polyploids. This projects aims to
provide gene-based (but genome-wide) exploration of
these processes. Building on existing transcriptomic
data collected from families of nascent synthetic allo-
hexaploids where 'binary DEGs' have been identied
(dierentially expressed genes showing no transcription
in the synthetic wheat despite robust transcription in
the parents), the PhD candidate will rst explore gene
losses and aneuploidy as the potential causes of such
patterns. Subsequently, the core of the project will fo-
cus on links between cytosine methylation and altered
expression. These will be explored through methylome
sequencing (Illumina) of amplicon libraries (homoeolog-
specic) constructed from the binary DEGs. Various
gene partitions (UTRs, exons, introns), sequence con-
texts (CpG, CHG, CHH), crossing schemes, tissues and
generation will be examined to provide a detailed as-
sessment of methylation changes in respect to altered
transcription in polyploids. These changes will be evalu-
ated in the context of wheat diversity and agronomically
important traits, with the aim to infoWarning: base64

and Genomics)
We are recruiting two graduate students to study white-
tailed ptarmigan population dynamics in the southern
Rocky Mountains of Colorado. This research is part of
a continuing long-term study of two ptarmigan popula-
tions (Mt. Evans and Trail Ridge [Rocky Mountain NP])
that began in 1966. The rst student (Demographic)
will investigate habitat relationships by combining newly
collected VHF-telemetry data with an existing location
database and applying resource selection functions to
model quality habitats, and predict likely future changes
to habitat under various climate scenarios. This stu-
dent will also conduct eld work to monitor breeding
activities during the spring and summer, and construct
population models used to estimate various demographic
rates and processes. The second student (Genomic) will
have access to a full genetic catalog of biological sam-
ples collected from every banded white-tailed ptarmigan
captured within the past 15 years, with associated re-
peated measurement data on timing of breeding events
(for females) and demographic data. This student will
potentially conduct paternity analyses, and relatedness
matrices for use in animal models to evaluate the adap-
tive nature and evolvability of timing of breeding and
molt. This student will also participate in the collection
of eld data. There will be considerable freedom for
both students to develop their own research program, so
long as they align at least somewhat with these research
topics.

a PhD Student in \Adaptation during range expansion
in European beech"
MyGardenOfTrees is aimed at performing a species
range-wide transplant experiment to assess the capac-
ity of regeneration of two forest tree species, European
beech and silver r, as well as their Mediterranean
and oriental sister species. The experimental part of
the project is based on participatory science, involves
foresters all across Europe, and is coordinated by a dedi-
cated senior researcher. Two PhD students will be hired
on this project working on complementary topics.
The current PhD position will focus on understanding
the adaptive and demographic processes that have led to
the range expansion of European beech (Fagus sylvatica
L.) after the last glacial maximum both at the genomic
and phenotypic level. Fagus sylvatica is best considered
as a species complex whose current range extends from
the Pyrenees to northern Iran. Despite the large genetic
diversity of beech populations in Minor Asia and on theBalkan peninsula, a single lineage has colonized most
of Europe. Had the colonizing lineage have superior
performance, and does it outperform other lineages still
today? Could current beech die-back across Europe be
partly attributed to the reduced genetic diversity due to
the expansion load or is it due to ongoing unprecedented
climate change? Could the introduction of other beech
lineages and hybridization between them be used to mit-
igate future climate change? The selected PhD student
will investigate these questions using a combination of
genomics, common garden experiments (performed by
foresters) and environmental data.
The ideal candidate holds a Masters degree in evolu-
tionary biology, genetics, plant science or in a related
discipline. S/he is expected to have experience and a
keen interest in evolutionary biology, forest genetics,
bioinformatics, and statistics, is uent in English, has
good written and oral communication skills, and can
work independently. The PhD thesis will be super-

ogy & multimodal communication in the spider Pisaura
mirabilis
A Research Assistant (f/m/d) (PhD candidate) (65%
TVL13) position is available in the DFG funded project
\Chemical and vibratory communication: testing the role
of spider silk in a reproductive context" in a joint col-
laboration project of Monika J. B. Eberhard, University
of Greifswald and Cristina Tuni, LMU Munich. The
position is limited to a period of 3 years, starting ideally
in January 2022.
Project Rationale Animals communicate with each other
using a wide range of sensory modalities, including chem-
ical, vibratory and visual signals. The complex inter-
play between these signals is crucial for their survival
and reproduction. Hence, understanding the functional
role of multimodal signalling is key to the study of an-
imal communication, and remains a major objective
for behavioural ecologists. Spiders represent a partic-
ularly well-suited taxonomical group for studying the
evolutionary function of vibratory- and chemical-based
signalling. In the present project, we aim to uncover
the functional roles of vibratory and chemical signals,
as well as their interaction, by addressing silk-borne
communication between the sexes in the spider Pisaura
mirabilis (Pisauridae). In the course of the project, the
PhD candidate will explore the functional role of male
(and female) vibrational signals in a reproductive con-
text by assessing whether vibratory courtship confers
tness benets to the signaller. We will reveal whether
P. mirabilis males are able to plastically adjust their
vibratory performance to variation in female reproduc-
tive quality. We will additionally explore the role of
silk in facilitating the transmission of vibratory signals.
Furthermore, we will determine the use and integration
of male multimodal communication components in fe-
males by assessing the interplay between vibratory and
chemical courtship signalling, in close collaboration with
a second PhD project based at LMU Munich who will
focus on the chemical communication in P. mirabilis.
Tasks: i) Laser-vibrometer recording and behavioural
analysis of male (and female) vibratory courtship in dif-
ferent contexts (see Eberhard et al. 2020 Behav. Ecol.
Sociobiol. 74; Eberhard et al. 2020 Ethology 127, for
details on P. mirabilis vibratory signals) ii) Conducting
playback and mate choice experiments iii) Investigate
tness outcome (paternity share) of mating trials using
microsatellite analyses iv) Assess transmission charac-
teristics of signals on various substrates and dragline silk
v) Design and conduct experiments combining vibratory
and chemical signalling vi) Scientic publication and
attendance of congresses
Your prole The successful candidate holds a degree(M.Sc.) in a relevant eld (e.g., zoology, ethology,
evolutionary biology or other related biological disci-
pline) and has a sound knowledge in behavioural ecol-
ogy and experimental work. Ideally, the candidate has
the necessary practical skills to conduct recordings with
a laser-vibrometer and analyse vibratory/acoustic sig-
nals. Knowledge of competitive microsatellite PCR tech-
nique, multivariate statistical analysis of behavioural
data (preferably in R) and publication experience in sci-
entic journals are an asset. Furthermore, very good or-
ganizational and communication skills are required. Ex-
cellent English skills, oral as well as written are expected;
German language skills are helpful but not mandatory.
Since the present position is linked to a second PhD
project conducted at LMU Munich, a strong sense of
team spirit and the disposition to conduct part of the
research at LMU Munich (ca. 3 months) is important.
We oer a creative, appreciative working environment
with a high degree of personal responsibility in a diverse
and motivated team. You will benet from a research
network of national and international cooperation part-
ners, especially with the collaborators at LMU Munich.
About Greifswald: Founded in 1456, the University of
Greifswald is one of the oldest universities in Germany

We are seeking a motivated Masters student for a project:
Biological Clocks in the Wild: the eects of articial
light at night on circadian rhythms of a migratory bird
at the Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian
University (Poland)
What do we study: It is well established that biolog-
ical rhythms are fundamental drivers of biochemistry,
cell biology, physiology and behaviour. The regularity
of behaviours is governed by endogenous clocks, which
are adjusted and synchronised with environmental cues,
primarily light. Rapidly expanding anthropopressure
largely disrupts these cues. Yet, it is surprising how little
we know about the eects of disorders in the function-
ing of the internal time-keepers in free-ranging animals.
The project will aim at understanding the eects of
disturbance in environmental cues, i.e. light exposure,
on circadian clock of a wild migratory bird: collared
ycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We will employ an ex-
perimental setup introducing articial light at night in
nestboxes during breeding season, at dierent stages
of development and quantify its eects on circadian
clock, physiology and behaviour. As a result we will
try to build a comprehensive understanding of shifts in
circadian rhythms and their consequences in a natural
population.
Job description: The MSc candidate will actively par-
ticipate in eldwork (collecting phenotypic, biological
and environmental data), analytical and lab work. S/he
will be interacting with the PI and other team members,
collaborators in Poland and worldwide, and attend rel-

the candidate will learn a large ecological skill set that
will allow him/her to infer the evolutionary ecology of
disturbed photoperiods in wild ycatchers. Specically,
the thesis will focus on the behavioral part of the project
and the tasks will involve:
* active participation in eldwork across two breeding
seasons (ca. 2-3 months each year) on the Swedish island
of Gotland, * installation of cameras and light sources

- Based at the Department of Biology (Lund University).
- Application deadline: 15 October 2021.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A four-year fully-funded PhD position is available to
develop Machine Learning methods that will reconstruct
the origin of domestic horses and help us understand
their contribution to the success of Scandinavian Vikings.
Ancient DNA (aDNA) has changed history studies, en-
abling us to analyze early genetic variation directly. In
recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the
amount of collected aDNA and high-prole investiga-
tions. Still, insucient information about the timing
and geographical origin has limited the usefulness of
the collected data and resulted in many erroneous re-
ports. The project aims to develop machine learning
tools to date aDNA and predict the geographical ori-
gin of the DNA material. The ML methods developed
for this project will be used to reconstruct the origin
of domestic horses and their contribution to the suc-
cess of Scandinavian Vikings. The analyses will use
state-of-the-art genomic methods to assess the migra-
tion routes and subsequent changes in population struc-
ture and genetic diversity. The PhD student will join
the community of bioinformaticians at Lund University
and our international research team. The PhD stu-
dent will join the lab group led by Eran Elhaik http:/-
/www.eranelhaiklab.org/, located at Lund University,
Sweden.
WORK DUTIES
Candidates are expected to be interested in biology and
history alongside solid computational skills with a back-
ground in statistics, physics, computer science, and/or
a related eld. Candidates are also expected to have
fundamental knowledge and experience with Machine
Learning methods. The candidate will work jointly with
Dr. Eran Elhaik, Dr. Patrik Eden, and Prof. Eske
Willerslev (at the University of Copenhagen) to develop
statistical methods for a project in population genetics.
This is a multi-disciplinary project involving program-
ming and modeling. In addition, the project will involvecollaborations with researchers in other disciplines, in-
cluding biomathematics, biostatistics, and molecular
biology. The candidate is expected to have a strong
grounding in programming in R and math/statistics.
The main duties of doctoral students are to devote
themselves to their research studies which include par-
ticipating in research projects and third cycle courses.
The work duties can also include teaching and other
departmental duties (no more than 20%).

PhD position on song learning in birds
Disentangling early life experience and genetics in song
learning
Based at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm Uni-
versity
Application deadline: 2021-11-05 (opens 2021-10-15)
Project descriptionA 4-year PhD position, funded by the European Re-
search Council, is available in the research group of
David Wheatcroft (https://wheatcroftlab.com/). We
utilize an inter-discplinary approach to disentangle the
roles of early life experience and genetics in song learn-
ing in pied ycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), collared
ycatchers (F. albicollis), and their hybrids. These ap-
proaches include long-term eld monitoring, behavioral
experiments in the eld and laboratory (including oper-
ant conditioning), acoustic analysis, neuroscience, and
genomics. A major focus is understanding the build-up
of species (and population) dierences in songs and song
preferences.
Within this framework, the exact focus of the project is
exible and depends on the specic interests and skills of
the applicant. Among other topics, the project could fo-
cus on the proximate mechanisms underlying responses
to songs in juvenile birds and connecting these responses
to subsequent learning, utilizing behavioral and/or neu-
roscientic approaches to assess auditory-vocal develop-
ment, and exploring how early life conditions inuence
subsequent behavioral traits, including song.
An important focus of the research would be on groups
of juvenile pied ycatchers, kept at Tovetorp research
station, around 1.5 hour from Stockholm University
(https://www.tovetorp.com/). Captive-rearing allows
us to manipulate song experience and track the devel-
opment of auditory ability and song production. In
addition, we study wild ycatchers during the breeding
season, allowing for projects connecting the lab with
the eld.
Research environment

be part of the Division of Ethology. There is a long-
standing tradition for researchers at the Division of
Ethology to collaborate with researchers from other
elds, such as evolutionary ecology, theoretical evolu-
tionary biology, and the study of cultural evolution.
Selection criteria The selection among the eligible candi-
dates will be based on their capacity to benet from the

BirdBatEvolution
The Behaviour, Evolution, and Conservation Lab
(BEAC Lab) at Thompson Rivers University (Kamloops,
BC) is seeking two M.Sc. students to lead projects on
trait and behaviour evolution in birds and bats. The po-
sitions will begin in 2022 (January, May, or September
start dates are all possible).
Project Description: Recent work in the BEAC Lab has
focused on large-scale phylogenetic analyses aimed at
understanding the evolutionary drivers of trait evolution
in both birds and bats. For example, recent students
have investigated body size and plumage evolution on
islands across all passerines, the evolutionary drivers
of altitudinal migration, and the ecological factors pro-
moting dierent moult strategies. We have compiled
massive trait databases for all species of birds and bats
and have several projects to explore (e.g., brain size
evolution, sexually selected trait evolution, mating sys-
tem evolution) depending on the students' background
and interests. All research will be computationally in-
tensive and require extensive work in R. There is no
eld work required as part of this project, though stu-
dents are always encouraged to help out on eld crews
working on other project in my lab (mountain bluebirds
and mountain chickadees) in the summer. To get a
better sense of research done in the BEAC Lab, visit
www.mattreudink.com and check the publications page.
Students will be funded at $18,500/year by a combi-
nations of graduate research awards, teaching assis-
tantships, and supervisor stipend. Canadian citizens
and permanent residents strongly encouraged; unfor-
tunately, international tuition costs are prohibitively
expensive and tuition wavers are not available.
Qualications: Candidates must possess a Bachelor's
degree in Biology, Zoology, or related eld. Academic
transcript must meet the qualications required for en-
trance to the Masters of Environmental Science program
at TRU (https://www.tru.ca/science/masters-degrees/-
msces.html).
The ideal candidate will have experience working with R
and a solid foundation in statistics. In addition, candi-
dates must possess a strong understanding of evolution-
ary theory and a passion for problem solving. Strong
writers and applicants with research experience (e.g.,Honours research) encouraged. Candidates must be able
to work collaboratively in a large team environment con-
sisting of undergraduate and graduate students.
About TRU and the BEAC Lab: Thompson Rivers
University campuses are on the traditional lands
of the Tk'eml ~Aops te Secw epemc (Kamloops cam-
pus) and the T'exelc (Williams Lake campus) within
Secw epemc'ulucw, the traditional and unceded territory
of the Secw epemc people. Our region also extends into
the territories of the Stat'imc, Nlaka'pamux, Nuxalk,
Tsilhqot'in, Dakelh and M etis peoples.
TRU is a primarily undergraduate institution with only
masters programs (no PhD program) and a strong em-
phasis on undergraduate research. As a result, M.Sc.
students in my lab work closely and collaboratively with
undergraduates.
Kamloops, BC is located in Interior British Columbia
between the Coast Range and the Rocky Mountain.
The climate is fantastic with hot summers, cold winters,
and amazing outdoor recreation. Sun Peaks (Canada's
second largest ski resort behind Whistler) is only 40
minutes away and the mountain biking in Kamloops is
legendary.
The BEAC Lab is a strong proponent of Equity, Di-
versity, and Inclusion and encourages applications from
BIPOC, LGBTQIA2+, and other under-represented
groups.
To Apply: Please send a cover letter, CV, unocial
transcripts, and contact information for 3 references to
Matt Reudink (mreudink@tru.ca). Applications will
be considered as they are received until the position is
lled.

EvolutionaryGenomics
Graduate Student in Evolutionary Functional Genomics
at UC Irvine
The Briscoe, Emerson, Gaut, Kvon, Lee, Long, and
Thornton labs at the University of California, Irvine
are looking for prospective Ph.D. students to join us.
Research in our labs probes the connection between
variation in genes and genomes and how that aects or-
ganismal phenotypes. These labs specialize on topics in
evolutionary genetics, including genome structural varia-
tion, evo-devo, epigenomics, genomics of domestication,
transposable element evolution, experimental evolution,
molecular evolution of the visual system, the genetics
of complex traits, population and behavioral genetics.
The common theme is that we combine evolutionary
biology with genomics approaches (3rd-generation se-
quencing, transcriptomics, epigenomics, 3D genomics,
genome editing etc) to understand the evolutionary
causes and functional consequences of natural variation.
Our students train in both \wet" and \dry" lab ap-
proaches. While many specialize in bioinformatics and
big data methodologies, others carry out cutting-edge
genomics experiments or specialize in dissecting organ-
ismal traits (e.g, domestication, vision, Lyme disease).
There is strong interaction and collaboration across labs,
and co-advising is common and welcome. Each lab also
has a strong dedication to individual development and
mentoring.
We are part of the Department of Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology (https://ecoevo.bio.uci.edu/), the Center
for Evolutionary Genetics (https://evogen.bio.uci.edu/),
and Center for Complex Biological Systems (https:/-
/ccbs.uci.edu/), which is a vibrant multi-disciplinary
center.

UDenver OriginSponges
Scott Nichols' lab (scottnicholslab.weebly.com) at the
University of Denver, Department of Biological Sciences,
is recruiting graduate students for the 2022/23 academic
year. The Nichols lab studies the molecular and cel-
lular foundations of animal origins. Three main areas
of research include 1) the evolution of epithelial orga-
nization, 2) the origin of novel animal cell types, and
3) the evolution of microbial recognition and response
mechanisms in animals (innate immunity). We address
these topics primarily through the study of sponges,
but with opportunities for comparative work in cnidar-
ians (sea anemones). Students are welcome to work
in any of these broad areas and encouraged to become
the intellectual drivers of their own projects. Our re-
search is integrative and incorporates methods for cell
and developmental biology, genomics and proteomics,
molecular biology and biochemistry - but at the core we
are organismal biologists and strive to always interpret
our results in the broadest evolutionary context, and at
the whole-organism level.
The University of Denver is located minutes from down-
town Denver Colorado, at the edge of the Rocky Moun-
tains. The Department of Biological Sciences is currently
composed of 21 tenure-track faculty and ~40 graduate
students. The application deadline is January 15th,
2022, the GRE exam is not required. Because the de-
partment is \direct admission," students are assigned
to a specic lab at the point of admission rather than
rotating between labs in their rst year. Therefore, be-
fore applying, applicants should directly contact Scott
Nichols (scott.nichols@du.edu) to discuss their interest
in joining the lab. At point of contact, please provide
some background about yourself, including stating your
specic interests in the Nichols lab. Both MS and PhDstudents are oered full tuition remission and a living
stipend. This applies to both domestic and international
applicants.
The most competitive applicants will have taken un-
dergraduate courses in cell and molecular biology and
evolution. Experience with molecular biology techniques
in a research lab setting is preferred but not required.

AvianInbreeding
PhD scholarship 'Inbreeding, mitochondrial performance
and senescence in birds' (B045221)
We are looking for a student who wishes to design their
own PhD research project researching inbreeding ef-
fects on senescence and physiological mechanisms of
senescence. You will be supervised by Hannah Dugdale
(RUG; https://hannahdugdale.wordpress.com), Simon
Grith (MQ; https://grithecology.com), and DavidS Richardson (University of East Anglia, UK; https://-
people.uea.ac.uk/david richardson).
This is a double degree at RUG and MQ. For the rst
two-years you will be based at RUG and embedded in the
Seychelles Warbler Project (http://seychelles-warbler-
project.group.shef.ac.uk). You will conduct eldwork
in the Seychelles for a minimum of two seasons (up to
3 months per season), with a COVID-19 contingency
plan. For the second two-years you will be based in
Australia on the MQ campus. You will be part of a
team of PhD students, post-docs, and sta who are
using long-term individual-based datasets of natural
and captive populations to improve understanding of
life-history evolution.
As a PhD scholarship student, you will develop your
own research project in consultation with the associated
supervisors. You will conduct independent and original
scientic research, report results via peer-reviewed publi-
cations, conference presentations, and ultimately a PhD
thesis. The PhD thesis has to be completed within four
years. Being part of a cutting-edge research programme,
you will receive training in the form of hands-on instruc-
tion, advanced courses, summer/winter schools, as well
as complementary workshops on generic research and
transferable skills. Special attention is paid to train-
ing activities directed towards your future (academic or
non-academic) career after the PhD trajectory, in the
context of the RUG's Career Perspective Series, and the
Research Training Certication Program at MQ.
Project One of the most profound challenges we all face
is our deterioration with age - a process known as senes-
cence. Individuals clearly senesce dierently, in both
the age they start to deteriorate and the rate of their
decline. However, the underlying causes of these dier-
ences in senescence patterns remain poorly understood.
Inbreeding increases the proportion of the genome that
is identical by descent, reducing genetic heterozygosity
and increasing the expression of deleterious recessive
alleles, thus reducing tness. Genomic markers provide
power to estimate heterozygosity and test the prediction
that inbreeding depression increases with age. Addition-
ally, improved understanding of the cellular physiology
of senescence will highlight potential mechanisms of
senescence. This will help clarify why some individuals
are less able to buer against senescence, perhaps, for
example, due to their genetic makeup or mitochondrial
performance.
You will design your project to investigate inbreeding
eects on senescence, and physiological senescence. In
the Netherlands, you will have the long-term Seychelles
warbler dataset available to address this question. Sey-
chelles warblers are cooperative breeders and we haveOctober 1, 2021 EvolDir 25
detailed life-history data of over 2,000 birds, spanning
more than 30 years. High variance in both senescence
and inbreeding occurs in the population. Over 450 birds
in our dataset are inbred, and inbreeding eects ac-
cumulation over life and impact strongly on survival.
Potential research questions are how genome-wide het-
erozygosity aects senescence, and whether heterozy-
gosity tness correlations arise due to locus specic or
genome-wide eects. In Australia, you will work on the
cellular physiology of senescence using a captive popula-
tion of long-tailed nches. In this captive population we
have a good pedigree with known demography and use
approaches to measure mitochondrial performance non
invasively. This component will provide insight into po-
tential underlying mechanisms of organismal senescence.
The overall project will improve our understanding of
how and why some individuals live longer, healthier lives,
and provide important insights into ways of mitigating
senescence.

phologyOfSpiderChelicerae
Dr. Hannah Wood (National Museum of Natural His-
tory, Smithsonian Institution - NMNH) and Dr. Je
Shultz (University of Maryland, College Park - UMD)
are seeking a PhD student. The PhD student will con-
tribute to an NSF-funded project that examines the
evolution of cheliceral form and function across spiders.
This project uses several dierent methodologies, with
the main goal of understanding cheliceral diversica-
tion: 1) gathering UCE sequence data and phylogenetic28 EvolDir October 1, 2021
analysis; 2) micro-Computed-Tomography scanning and
3D-morphometric analysis; 3) histological sectioning; 4)
high-speed videography of cheliceral strikes; 5) compar-
ative phylogenetic techniques. The PhD student will
have freedom to develop their own projects, although
ideally their project would align with the goals of the
NSF-funded project, that of using phylogenetics and
functional morphology to understand morphological evo-
lution in spiders.
Applicants can come from a variety of backgrounds, but
we are particularly interested in those with a strong inter-
est in functional morphology, evolution, phylogenetics,
and Arachnology. The doctoral degree and coursework
will be based at UMD, but the PhD student will have
freedom to divide their time as needed between the two
institutions (UMD and NMNH - about a 45-50 minute
metro ride between).
Financial support will be provided through research and
teaching assistantships at UMD. The UMD stipend will
be at least $29K per year, and includes health coverage
and tuition for a total compensation package that may
exceed $38K per year. Exceptional applicants may be
nominated for additional fellowships.
To be considered, send an email to Hannah Wood
(woodh@si.edu) and/or Je Shultz (jshultz@umd.edu)
that includes the following attachments: 1) a cover letter
expressing your interest, your qualications for the po-
sition, and your future career goals, 2) your curriculum
vitae, 3) an unocial copy of your college transcripts,
and 4) names and contact information of 2-3 professional
references.
To receive full consideration, submit your letter and
supporting materials by Oct. 15, 2021; however, we will
consider candidates until the position is lled. Please
note that the selected candidate will need to apply and
be accepted to the UMD Dept of Entomology (applica-
tions are due on Dec. 1, 2021 for a start date of Fall
2022). If needed, the student can begin working earlier
as a lab technician, starting as early as Jan 2022.
Please email Hannah Wood (woodh@si.edu) or Je
Shultz (jshultz@umd.edu) with any questions or con-
cerns about this position.

USalzburg Eel phylogenomics
migration
We are seeking a motivated Ph.D. student to work in
an Austrian Science Fund project entitled: From Myth
to Reason - Population structure and spawning area(s)
of tropical eels in the southwestern Indian Ocean.
The project focuses on two aspects:
(i) Whole genome sequencing data will be analysed to as-
sess the population structure of Indian Ocean species of
the genus Anguilla throughout their distribution ranges.
Additionally, genomic data for population samples of
all species of the genus Anguilla (16 species and 3 sub-
species) will be analysed to investigate their phylogeny
together with signals of interspecic hybridization.
(ii) Endemic Anguilla mossambica will be tagged with
satellite transmitters to study their marine migration
routes from Madagascar, locate their spawning area
(which they may share with one or more of co-occurring
species), and assess the oceanographic conditions along
the eels' migration path to identify landmarks that the
eels may use to nd their spawning area.
Using existing population samples, the Ph.D. student
will study the evolutionary and biogeographic history
of species dierentiation and hybridization across all
anguillid species with whole genome sequencing. In
addition, the student will have the possibility to join
eldwork in Madagascar for tagging eels with pop-up
satellite archival transmitters and the collection of addi-tional tissue samples for genomic analyses. The position
will be based at the University of Salzburg, supervised
by Robert Schabetsberger. Prolonged research visits
will be included to perform molecular work together
with collaborators Robert Jehle (University of Salford,
UK) and Chrysa Gubili (Fisheries Research Institute,
Greece), and to perform bioinformatic analyses together
with Michael Matschiner (University of Oslo, Norway)
and Julia Barth (University of Basel, Switzerland).

UtahStateU PredictingEvolution
The Gompert lab in the Department of Biology at Utah
State University (USU) is seeking a highly motivated
and enthusiastic PhD student with interests in fore-
casting ecological and evolutionary processes from time-
series data. Research in the lab addresses a range of
fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary bi-
ology. We are particularly interested in the ecological
causes and evolutionary consequences of natural selec-
tion, the causes and consequences of genetic variation in
the wild, the role of hybridization in evolution, and the
nature and evolution of species boundaries and barriers
to gene ow. This specic position is funded through a
NSF LTREB award to Zach Gompert (and collaborator
Matt Forister at the University of Nevada). A stipend
will be provided via a mixture of teaching and research
assistantships. Review of applicants will begin Novem-
ber 1, 2021. The start date for the PhD project is fall
2022.
Project Overview: The history of life on Earth has many
periods of mass extinction, when many species cease to
exist. These periods are usually studied through use of
fossils. Although fossils have revealed a lot about extinc-
tion, they???ve been unable to solve the basic riddle of
why some species go extinct and others seem unaected.
Humans are now witnessing a mass extinction event,
which provides biologists an opportunity to study in
real time how species dier in their responses to climate
change and other stressors. Some may go extinct within30 EvolDir October 1, 2021
our lifetimes; others won???t. This project builds on one
of North America???s longest-running studies of (but-
tery) insect populations by continuing data collection
at ve sites in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Northern
California. Encompassing more than 150 species of but-
teries, this NSF funded LTREB project will explore
habitat use by both butteries and caterpillars to better
understand climate impacts on insect populations. Of
particular interest is the role of extreme droughts, which
are aecting the western United States with increasing
frequency. Results from the project will inform our
understanding of ongoing insect and pollinator declines.
Specic Responsibilities: We are looking for a PhD stu-
dent interested in collaborating on the project. Specif-
ically, the PhD student will use computational meth-
ods, including hierarchical Bayesian models and neural
networks, to make predictions about future buttery
population demographics while accounting for uncer-
tainty in future climate and possible eects of adaptive
evolutionary change. The student will be tasked with
maintaining a website making forecasts available to the
public. Additional components of the PhD student???s
dissertation will be tailored to the student???s interests
and background. Possible projects could make connec-
tions to Gompert???s funded work on contemporary
evolution and uctuating selection in Lycaeides butter-
ies, but this is not required. The student will have the
opportunity to visit the eld sites, but collecting the
buttery count data is not a key part of the student???s
project.
The successful candidate should have previous training
in ecology, evolutionary biology, population genetics,
applied math and statistics, or computational biology.
Some prociency with programming (e.g., moderate
comfort with R, C, java, perl, or python) is desirable.
Experience working with climate models or ecological
forecasting would be an asset, but is not essential. Stu-
dents with or without a Master???s degree are encour-
aged to apply. We welcome and encourage enthusiastic
and open-minded applicants from any nation, ethnicity,
gender, sexual orientation or socioeconomic class. For
more information about the Gompert lab, including a
statement of mentoring philosophy and expectations,
please visit the lab website at https://gompertlab.com/ .

PhD Student- The evolution of sexual conict We oer
a fully funded 3+1 yr PhD position starting ca. July-
August 2022; meaning that, if the PhD is nished in less
than 4 years, the student can transfer to a junior post
doc position for the remaining time. We are looking for
a PhD student interested in studying the evolutionary
factors modulating the intensity of male-male competi-
tion and sexual conict, and its consequences in terms of
population viability. Strong sexual selection can improve
population viability and evolvability through processes
such as genic capture. However, strong sexual selection
will also often give rise to sexual conict and female
harm, which does not only tend to deviate females from
their evolutionary optima, but can drastically aect
population viability, leading to a \reproductive tragedy
of the commons". We are interested in understanding
what factors modulate the evolution of male-male com-
petition, female harm levels, and sexual conict at large,
and how this all feeds back into population viability and
evolvability.
We work mainly with (mostly wild) Drosophila
melanogaster, which typically involves behavioural ex-
periments in the lab, experimental evolution, some eld-
work across Europe and the USA/Australia, and poten-
tially some genomics/proteomics. This PhD position
may also involve some mathematical modelling. We
are looking for a motivated, enthusiastic, hard-working

in sexual selection, and evolutionary biology and animal
behaviour at large.The student will be supervised by Dr.
Pau Carazo and based at the Behaviour and Evolution

ASN-SSB-SSE-EvolutionMeetings
AssocConferenceOrganizers
The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), on behalf
of the Joint ASN/SSB/SSE council, seeks two members
of one or more of our societies to help plan and run our
annual scientic conference - the Evolution meetings
(https://www.evolutionmeetings.org). The meetings arecoordinated by a Chief Meeting Ocer (CMO), an aca-
demic who oversees all aspects of the meeting and who is
responsible for nal decisions about schedules, activities
and venues, in consultation with a tri-society Joint Meet-
ing Committee (JMC) and the larger ASN/SSB/SSE
Joint Council. The CMO also acts as the principal liai-
son with a Professional Conference Organizer (PCO),
whose responsibilities include executing the logistics of
conference management, interactions with vendors and
service providers, and helping identify and negotiate
contracts with future meeting venues.
We are currently seeking two Associate CMOs who willOctober 1, 2021 EvolDir 71
assist the CMO with organization, including interfacing
with society councils and other stakeholders, producing
the scientic program, and providing academic insight
to help guide the work of the PCO. Duties will be di-
vided between the Associate CMOs as determined by
the CMO and the JMC, and in consultation with them.
Associate CMOs will normally serve a 3-years term and
may transition into the lead CMO role after this (or
earlier if necessary). Helping run our meetings is an
important and valuable service to our societies and our
eld which is largely a volunteer eort, but each ACMO
will be given a stipend of $5000 in appreciation. All
meeting attendance costs will be also be covered, as well
as any other costs associated with carrying out meeting
responsibilities.
The time commitment is variable but is expected to
average a few hours/week, ramping up at certain times
depending on particular tasks and in the month preced-
ing the meeting. Much of the time is spent in electronic
communication and virtual meetings, but there may
also be some duties at the conference.
These positions are best suited to someone who has
attended several of our recent meetings, has academic
organizational and leadership experience, enjoys team-
work, and would nd it rewarding to serve the societies
by fostering dynamic and high-quality meetings. We
welcome expressions of interest in these positions. To do
so, please contact evolution.meetings@gmail.com with
'ACMO positions' in the subject and include any rele-
vant experience and a CV with your message. The goal
is to ll these positions as soon as possible to aid the cur-
rent CMO (Howard Rundle) in the planning of the 2022
meeting, currently scheduled to be held in Cleveland,
Ohio, on June 24-28. Note that there are no geographic
restrictions and no citizenship or residency requirements,
but attendance at the 2022 and subsequent meetings is
expected.
About the annual conference: The Evolution meet-
ing is the joint conference of the American Society of
Naturalists, the Society for the Study of Evolution,
and the Society of Systematic Biologists. The con-
ference is held in a dierent location every year, pri-
marily in the United States but occasionally in other
countries (see https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/past{
future-meetings.html). Recent and future locations
include Austin Texas, Portland Oregon, Montpellier
France, Providence Rhode Island, and Cleveland Ohio.
The meeting is the premier opportunity for sharing re-
search on evolutionary biology. The conference attracts
between 1600-2000 attendees and includes more than
1,000 oral presentations, 400-500 posters, a diverse array
of social events, and a variety of workshops. It runs for
approximately 5 days (depending on satellite events) inmid-late June. Evolution has an enforced meeting Code
of Conduct and a strong commitment to promoting eq-
uity and inclusion. More information is available on the
conference web site: http://www.evolutionmeetings.org,
including complete programs from recent meetings. Con-
ferences are run on a break-even basis with careful atten-
tion given to minimizing registration costs for attendees.

Hi everyone,
In need of a pause in this busy month? Go on buttery
hunting for a few minutes!
As part of a project led by researchers from CEFE
(Montpellier, France), MNHN (Paris, France), and
INRIA (Bordeaux, France) and the University of
North Carolina (US), *we have developed a citizen
science game to better understand camouage* meth-
ods and their eectiveness against predation: https://-
ndthebutteryv2.cleverapps.io/
If you have played the previous game \nd the butter-
y", no problem, just let us know by checking the box
and play the new game! These are two independent
games and your help will be precious this time too! If
you have already played this very game, indicate it, but
your contribution will not be taken into account. *We
need inexperienced hunters to increase our sample size.
*
Play the role of a hungry predator looking for butteries
camouaged in their environment and click as quickly
as possible on the buttery hidden in the image! To
play, it's easy: take a card of the format of a credit card
(so that we have an idea of the real size of the images
on your screen), your favorite computer (the game is
not designed to be played on a smartphone) and let's
go: it will only take you about 10 minutes!
Please share this link with your networks, friends, family,
and colleagues...
We need a lot of responses from all age groups, includ-
ing children! The more players, the more consistent the
results!
Have fun and thank you for your contribution!

10.1101/2021.09.15.460360 |{ A novel algorithm to
ag columns associated in any way with others or a
dependent variable is computationally tractable in
large data matrices and has much higher power when
columns are linked like mutations in chromosomes.
Marcos A. Antezana ===== STRACT. When a data
matrix DM has many independent variables IVs, it is
not computationally tractable to assess the association
of every distinct IV subset with the dependent variable
DV of the DM, because the number of subsets explodes
combinatorially as IVs increase. But model selection
and correcting for multiple tests is complex even with
few IVs.
DMs in genomics will soon summarize millions of mark-
ers (mutations) and genomes. Searching exhaustively
in such DMs for mutations that alone or synergistically
with others are associated with a trait is computation-
ally tractable only for 1- and 2-mutation eects. This is
also why population geneticists study mainly 2-marker
combinations.
I present a computationally tractable, fully paralleliz-
able Participation in Association Score (PAS) that in a
DM with markers detects one by one every column that
is strongly associated in any way with others. PAS does
not examine column subsets and its computational cost
grows linearly with the number of columns, remaining
reasonable even when DMs have millions of columns.
PAS P values are readily obtained by permutation and
accurately Sidak-corrected for multiple tests, bypassing
model selection. The P values of a column's PASs and
dvPASs for dierent orders of association are i.i.d. and
easily turned into a single P value.
PAS exploits how associations of markers in the rows of
a DM cause associations of matches in the pairwise com-
parisons of the rows. For every such comparison with a
match at a tested column, PAS computes the matches
at other columns by modifying the comparison's total
matches (scored once per DM), yielding a distribution
of conditional matches that reacts diagnostically to the
associations of the tested column. Equally computation-
ally tractable is dvPAS that ags DV-associated IVs by
also probing the matches at the DV.
Simulations show that i) PAS and dvPAS generate
uniform-(0,1)-distributed type I error in null DMs and ii)
detect randomly encountered binary and trinary models
of signicant n-column association and n-IV association
to a binary DV, respectively, with power in the order of
magnitude of exhaustive evaluation's and false positives
that are uniform-(0,1)-distributed or straightforwardly
tuned to be so. Power to detect 2-way associations
that extend over 100+ columns is non-parametrically
ultimate but that to detect pure n-column associationsand pure n-IV DV associations sinks exponentially with
increasing n.
Important for geneticists, dvPAS power increases about
twofold in trinary vs. binary DMs and by orders of
magnitude with markers linked like mutations in chro-
mosomes, specially in trinary DMs where furthermore
dvPAS ne-maps with highest resolution.

UHolar FishCognitionInternship
Hello everyone,
The Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology, H olar
University, Iceland, is looking for a Masters student for a
project about Arctic charr spatial cognition. See advert
below:
Title : Internship position in sh behavior and cognition
Hosting structure : Department of Aquaculture & sh
Biology, H olar University - Iceland
Dates : from January 2022 to June 2022, but discussable
Context of the study: Comparative studies might give
an insight on how cognition has evolved across taxa.
The evolution of spatial cognition is of particular inter-
est because all animals depend on navigational skills
to nd food or mates, retrieve the nest and escape
predators. Hence, spatial cognitive abilities have an
impact on individuals' tness and are consequently sub-
ject to natural selection. In that sense, spatial cognitiveabilities in each population should be locally adapted
to its particular ecological conditions. The Icelandic
Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus, AC) is found as sev-
eral sympatric morphs thriving in very dierent types
of habitats, from anadromous to benthic and pelagic
lake-resident morphs, and ranging along an evolutionary
gradient of divergence. We hypothesize cognitive abili-
ties to be shaped according to both evolutionary history
and current ecological factors. The project is lead by
Prof. David Benha m (lead PI, H olar Univ., Iceland)
in collaboration across H olar Univ. (Prof. Bjarni K.
Kristj ansson, Dr. Camille Leblanc), University of Caen,
France (Dr. Christelle Jozet), IFREMER, France (Dr.
Marie- Laure B egout, Dr. Benjamin Geroy), INRA,
France (Dr. Xavier Cousin) and University of Iceland
(Prof. Zophon as O. J onsson).
Student project: The student will specically be in-
volved in identifying cognitive ability dierences between
morphs and environments, by monitoring learning abil-
ities in ospring of wild- caught AC morphs along a
degree of divergence and raised under complex vs. plain
conditions. To do so, the student will be working in
close collaboration with a PhD student to train AC in-
dividuals to solve spatial cognitive tasks in a maze, and
then highlight behavioral dierences using an automated
behavioral tracking software s/he will be introduced to.
Requirements: The candidates must be enrolled in a de-
gree in the elds of ethology, evolutionary or behavioral
ecology, or relevant equivalent elds. The ideal candi-
date has a strong interest in pluridisciplinary research
with an emphasis on cognition. S/he enjoys working in
a dynamic group but should be able to work indepen-
dently as well. Statistical skills will be a plus. A valid
driving license is a requirement.
Organizational details: Working language is English.
The student will be provided with a discount on Univer-
sity accommodation as a lab member, and commuting
between the lab and the accommodation place will be
at the lab's charge. The student will also have free ac-
cess to the University gym, pool, hot pot and cold pot.
Aside, remuneration is not available for this project, but
Iceland is eligible for Erasmus+ grants.
Application: Applicants should send an application let-
ter, with a statement of research interests and relevant
experience and curriculum vitae as a single pdf to both
Pr. David Benha m, benhaim@holar.is and Dr. Mar-
ion Dellinger, marion@holar.is. For further information

Project summary
CNVs are regions of the genome that vary in integer copy
number and are found across all domains of life, from
bacteria and archaea to plants and animals. CNVs are
now recognized as the largest source of interindividual
genetic variation that can aect more bases than sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), variable number
tandem repeats and other small genetic variants. New
bioinformatic approaches now make it possible to char-
acterize CNVs from short-read DNA sequencing data
(Kosugi et al., 2019) to unravel their role in population
adaptation.
The genus Malus, distributed throughout temperate
regions, includes all wild apple species, and one domes-
ticated species, Malus domestica. The origin of the
genus, as well as the history of apple domestication, hasbeen documented using genetic markers (microsatellites,
and nuclear and chloroplast sequences) (Cornille et al.,
2012; 2014; Bina et al., 2021). The origin of the genus
is supposed to be in China, followed by diversication
in America on the one hand, and to the West (Cau-
casus and Europe) on the other. Regarding the apple
domestication process, we now know that the cultivated
apple tree (M. domestica) originated in the mountains of
Kazakhstan in Central Asia from the wild species of this
same region, M. sieversii. During its journey along the
ancient Silk Roads, the cultivated apple tree underwent
recurrent introgressions involving the Caucasian and
European wild species, M. orientalis and M. sylvestris,
respectively (Cornille et al., 2012; Cornille et al., 2019;
Cornille et al., 2014). I Master project
The aim of the internship will be to build a bioinformatic
pipeline for the detection of CNV in wild and cultivated
apples. To address this question, we will use datasets of
short-read sequenced genomes of wild and cultivated ap-
ples Methodology: Bioinformatic, genomics, evolution,
statistical analyses, writing.
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the can-
didate will have skills in evolutionary genomics and
bioinformatics. He/she will not necessarily be familiar
with the apple model.
Gratication: 550 euros / month

Title: Responses of the a major contributor to the culti-
vated apple genome (Malus sylvestris) to climate change
Summary Crop wild relatives have a high potential
phenotypic and genetic diversity for future breeding
programs in the context climate change. However, the
study of responses to climate change have been sur-
prisingly neglected in crop wild relatives, especially in
fruit trees. Sustainable fruit production relies on the
selection of phenotypes in the cultivated germplasm pre-
senting adequate response to local climatic conditions.
However, those recent breeding often result in a reduc-
tion of genetic diversity and a loss of valuable allelesat genes not directly targeted by human selection. As
a consequence, important traits allowing response to
local climatic conditions may be absent in the cultivated
germplasm while present in wild relatives. The chal-
lenge is thus to investigate the response to climate of
wild close relatives of crop species in order to identify
phenological traits that can be introgressed into elite
lines in future breeding programs.
Using evolutionary genomics, the student will use a
powerful approach combining transplant experiments in
controlled climatic conditions, measures of growth rates,
phenological traits, and gene expression data to inves-
tigate the plastic responses of two wild apple relatives
(Malus sylvestris and Malus orientalis) of the cultivated
apple (Malus domestica) to climate change. The project
will bring new insight in how fruit tree species respond
to climate change and will therefore provide a practi-
cal basis for conservation, agroforestry, and breeding
programs for apples. The Master student will have the
opportunity to pursue a PhD project by applying to the
Doctoral School \Sciences du V??g??tal"

CNRS France PlantSexualSelection
A 18 months post-doctoral position is opened at the In-
stitut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier to study
sexual selection in plants in the context of the SEX-
MATE project funded by the University of Montpellier
(MUSE Tremplin ERC program to Jeanne Tonnabel).
Despite evidence that sexual selection operates in plants,
direct tests of fundamental concepts from the theory
of sexual selection are still lacking for the plant king-dom. The main barrier preventing the development
of a uniform and integrative theory of sexual selection
including plants lies in the lack of estimation and exper-
imental manipulation of the central parameter of sexual
selection thinking - the number of mating partners, i.e.
mating success. Studies in plants have primarily fo-
cused on proxies for mating success, such as pollinator
visits or number of ovules sired. Yet, the link between
these variables and mating success remains entirely un-
explored. Problematically, the most attractive plants to
pollinators may even fail at exporting pollen to mates
if they monopolize pollinator visits (thus reducing the
number of pollen recipients). Arguably, the presence of
a third party in the operation of sexual selection - the
pollinator - certainly introduces a level of complexity
that warrants attention, but it should be evaluated in
terms of its eect on plant mating success. The SEX-
MATE project aims at (1) providing a comprehensive
test of the theory of sexual selection in plants, and (2)
understanding the specicities of the operation of sexual
selection in plants.
Job description The recruited researcher will carry out
two experiments of the project on the model species
Brassica rapa: - The rst experiment will test a central
prediction of the sexual selection theory formulated by
'good-genes' models. It will ask whether plants that
perform better to access sexual partners also display
a better overall condition, with potentially important
implications for plant conservation. This rst experi-
ment will use quantitative genetics to estimate genetic
correlations between mating success, sexually-selected
traits and tness traits. - The second experiment will
investigate the link between the density of pollinators,
and the intensity of sexual selection which may bring
about dierent outcomes on male and female functions.
This second experiment will also decompose episodes of
sexual selection occurring in the phase of pollen disper-
sal to mates versus when pollen compete to access ovules
within pistils. This experiment will involve observations
of pollinator behaviour in controlled conditions, as well
as paternity analyses using microsatellite genotyping.
Qualication requirements The candidate should hold
a PhD in evolutionary biology with a solid background
in this discipline, have demonstrated expertise at least
in one of the following topics: sexual selection, mat-
ing systems evolution, or plant evolution, and have a
publication record corresponding to his/her experience.
The candidate should show a strong motivation both
for undertaking experiments and reading conceptual
papers on sexual selection. Candidates with expertise
in large experiments in plants, quantitative genetics,
and/or statistics are particularly welcome.
Candidates must be at ease with insect manipulationsOctober 1, 2021 EvolDir 85
(e.g. bumblebees, ies).
Good skills in English both for writing and oral commu-
nication are required.
Conditions The position will be held at the Institut des
Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM - UMR
5554). ISEM oers a very dynamic and stimulating
scientic environment for studying evolutionary biology
with an excellent scientic animation, and various ac-
tions directed towards young researchers. Experiments
will be performed on the nearby CNRS campus at the
Centre D'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE -
5175) which oers excellent plant growing facilities. Reg-
ular scientic meetings will also be held at the CEFE
with collaborators of the project (Dr. Patrice David
and Prof. Mathilde Dufa ~A>). Montpellier is a city lo-
cated near the sea in South of France with both a great
cultural life and various nearby natural environments.
The net salary per month will be ~2200 euros. Ap-
pointment is for 18 months with a possibility to extend
the contract (pending funding acquisition). For more
informations on the research group:

skills, two contacts information for references.

HarvardU EvoDevo
The laboratory of Dr. Cassandra Extavour at Harvard
University is looking for one or more collaborative, self-
motivated Postdoctoral Associates in Cambridge, MA.
The Extavour lab works on the evolution of develop-
ment at many dierent levels of biological organization
and scale. We seek to understand the evolutionary ori-
gins and modern functions of the genes that govern cell
fate decisions during animal development. We often86 EvolDir October 1, 2021
focus on the cell types that ensure that the evolution
process can take place at all in multicellular organ-
isms: the germ cells, that produce gametes, and the
gonads, which house the gametes. Because we can-
not understand evolution by studying a single organ-
ism, we use a wide range of model organisms, most of
which are insects, including Drosophila melanogaster
and many other species of Drosophila fruit ies. We
also employ a wide range of approaches, because we
wish to understand evolution from the perspective of
the gene, the protein, the cell, the organs, the organism,
and the ecological context. Current and previous lab
members have had expertise in genetics, microscopy,
biochemistry, bioinformatics, molecular evolution, de-
velopmental and cellular biology, and behavioural ecol-
ogy , and we are always interested in team members
who will bring new lenses of inquiry. More information
can be found on our website: www.extavourlab.com
<http://www.extavourlab.com./ >.<http://-
www.extavourlab.com./ >
The Postdoctoral Associate will have the opportunity
to study the evolution of development broadly speaking,
with some exibility in choosing the specic technical
approaches and model organisms to be used. We are
particularly interested in scientists with expertise in
bioinformatics, biochemistry, biophysics, microbiology,
ecology, and mathematical modelling, as we have a
number of ongoing research projects that would benet
from applying these ways of solving complex problems.
Projects under three major areas of our research are
available:
1. Drosophila Area: Understanding the animal, plant
and microbial contributions to the evolution of specic
adaptive traits and phenotypic plasticity, using both
Drosophila melanogaster and natural populations of
wild Drosophilaspecies in Hawaii. 2. Protein Evolution
Area: Elucidating the biochemical and biophysical basis
of evolutionary change in protein function, with a focus
on an insect gene whose ancestral function was likely
somatic, and which later acquired essential roles in the
germ line. 3. Evo-Devo Area: Using and developing non-
traditional model species to study the dynamic evolution
of early embryonic, germ cell and gonadal development
across 500 million years of insect evolution.
This is an excellent opportunity for someone with an
interest in developmental biology, evolution, evo-devo
and/or the origins of multicellularity to take leadership
roles in helping further existing work and developing new
projects within our broad intellectual framework, while
working with other passionate scientists in a collegial,
productive and project-driven laboratory.
The success of our research program relies on open andtransparent communication between all members of the
lab, and on our exibility in pursuing unusual new re-
search directions that arise as synergistic products of the
diverse array of perspectives in the lab. For this reason,
Dr. Extavour seeks to maintain a diverse and collabora-
tive lab, where a multiplicity of distinct personal and
professional experiences enhance both our intellectual
work, and our growth together as a supportive team of
people seeking to learn as much as we can individually
and collectively. Dr. Extavour is an experienced men-
tor with a proven track record of helping her trainees
cultivate professional development skills and success in
their subsequent independent scientic careers. Former
Extavour lab members have gone on to successful ca-
reers in academia, industry, education, communication,
government and the arts. In addition to professional
development opportunities within the lab and exposure
to a breadth of scientic disciplines, the Postdoctoral
Associate will be able to take advantage of the vibrant
scientic communities of Harvard University, the Quan-
titative Biology Initiative, the Museum of Comparative
Zoology, the Harvard University Herbaria, the Arnold
Arboretum, the Harvard Medical School, and the Broad
Institute of MIT and Harvard, as well as the numerous
other academic and research institutions in Boston and
the surrounding area.
Preferred Qualications
Education. A Ph.D. or M.D. is required. Ph.D. students
in the nal year of their thesis work are eligible to apply,
but proof of PhD will be required before their Postdoc-
toral Associate appointment can begin. Specic degree

BIOINFORMATICS POSTDOC IN EVOLUTIONARY
GENOMICS
Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), Heidelberg Uni-
versity, Germany
A postdoctoral position (3 years with possible exten-
sions) is available immediately in the evolutionary ge-
nomics group of Henrik Kaessmann.
We are seeking highly qualied and enthusiastic ap-
plicants with strong skills in computational biol-
ogy/bioinformatics, ideally also with experience in data
mining and comparative or evolutionary genome analy-
ses.
We have been interested in a range of topics related
to the origins and evolution of vertebrate organs. In
the framework of our research, we generate and ana-
lyze comprehensive genomics (e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq)
datasets based on samples from our large organ collec-
tions. More recently, we have begun to bring the work
of our lab to the level of single cells using state-of-the-
art single-cell genomics technologies and bioinformaticsprocedures.
The postdoctoral fellow will be funded by a recently
awarded ERC Advanced Grant. In the framework of
this grant, we seek to unravel the cellular and molecular
origins and evolution of the vertebrate brain. The fel-
low will perform integrated evolutionary/bioinformatics
analyses based on extensive single-cell transcriptomic
and epigenomic data as well as spatial transcriptomics
data produced in our lab for species representing all ma-
jor vertebrate lineages, ranging from jawless vertebrates
such as the sea lamprey to mammals such as platypus.
The precise project will be developed together with the
candidate.
In our lab, we attach great importance to a highly
collaborative and positive team spirit! And we are par-
ticularly fond of the diverse cultural backgrounds of
our lab members, which contribute to a very enriching
atmosphere.
The language of our institute is English and its members
form a highly international group. The ZMBH is located
in Heidelberg, a picturesque international city next to
the large Odenwald forest and Neckar river. The city
oers a very stimulating, diverse and collaborative re-
search environment, with the European Molecular Biol-
ogy Laboratory (EMBL), German Cancer Research Cen-
ter (DKFZ), Heidelberg Institute of Theoretical Studies
(HITS), and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Re-
search located in close proximity to the University.
For more information on the group and our institute
more generally, please refer to our website at the ZMBH

Postdoc in theory of evolution: modeling the evolution
of self-incompatibility
Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
Tamar Friedlander's lab https://www.friedlander-
lab.net/ Available immediately.
The Friedlander lab is seeking an outstanding, highly-
motivated, curious and creative post-doctoral researcher
for cutting-edge theoretical research addressing funda-
mental questions in evolution.
About the proposed research:The Friedlander lab studies theoretically how biological
networks evolve. Most evolutionary models consider
the evolution of a single gene, regardless of its network
context. Genes, however, are often part of a network,
where the products of one gene aect the activity of
others. A fascinating example for a medium-sized net-
work of interacting molecules is the self-incompatibility
system of plants. This system enables plants to distin-
guish between self and non-self fertilization by specic
matches and mismatches between pairs of specialized
proteins. This immediately raises fundamental theoret-
ical questions about the evolutionary emergence and
maintenance of this mechanism. The exact project will
be tailored with the candidate.
Our lab is theoretical-computational. The research is
inter-disciplinary and uses various tools borrowed from
exact sciences to address fundamental questions in biol-
ogy. On the mathematical side, the analysis will com-
prise for example evolutionary and biophysical models,
data analysis and stochastic computer simulations.
About the position:
There is funding available for two years, with possibility
of extension.
Qualications:
PhD in physics, mathematics, computer science, engi-
neering, computational biology or another related eld.
A prerequisite is a keen interest both in mathematical
modeling and in biological systems. Good quantita-
tive skills and knowledge of a programming language
(preferably in Matlab or Python) are essential.
Background in biology (formal or informal) in an advan-
tage, but not a must.
Salary: Commensurate with qualications and experi-
ence.
How to apply:
Interested candidates should submit:
a one-page cover letter indicating your scientic interests
and why you are a good t to the lab,
your CV and list of publications, and
names and contact information of at least three refer-
ences familiar with your work.

ProtistSymbiosisGenomics
Dear colleagues,
Please see below a brief description of a post-doc posi-
tion to study symbiotic interactions in protists at Lund
University, Sweden.
More details and how to apply: https://lu.varbi.com/-
what:job/jobID:425005/ Deadline: Oct. 14 2021 Con-
tact information: Any questions can be directed to
courtney.stairs@biol.lu.se, but all applications must be
submitted to 'Varbi'.
Subject description Every ecosystem on our planet is
composed of a complex community of organisms. The
function of these ecosystems is often dependent on inter-
actions - or symbioses - between community members.
In the microbial world, symbiotic interactions based on
syntrophy (i.e., a type of mutualistic symbiosis where92 EvolDir October 1, 2021
nutrients are exchanged between organisms to allow for
metabolic division of labour) are common, especially
between prokaryotic organisms in anoxic environments.
Such interactions are essential drivers of biogeochemi-
cal processes like global carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur
cycling. Whether similar roles can be attributed to
single-cell eukaryotes (protists) occupying these environ-
ments remains unclear owing in large part to our limited
understanding of the biology, syntrophic potential, and
metabolism of anaerobic eukaryotes.
The prospective post-doctoral fellow will be hosted by
Dr. Courtney Stairs with support of the Crafoord Stif-
telsen in the Biology Department at Lund University.
The fellow will develop single-cell sequencing techniques
to investigate the genomic and transcriptomic of individ-
ual eukaryotic cells and their resident microbial partners
isolated from anaerobic environments. These data will
be used to approximate metabolic interactions between
the organisms. The candidate will have the potential to
develop experimental detection methods to test these
predictions in collaborations with Drs. Ryan Gawryluk
(U. Victoria, Canada) and Edith Hammer (Lund Uni-
versity) as part of an international multi-disciplinary
research initiative funded by the New Frontiers in Re-
search Fund (awarded to Drs. Gawryluk and Stairs).
Work duties The work focuses on the development of
genomic tools to study individual protist cells. Some of
the planned methodology include anaerobic culturing,
environmental sampling, 18S metabarcoding, split-pool
barcoding transcriptomics, metagenomics, bioinformat-
ics and phylogenic analysis.
The main duties involved in a post-doctoral position
is to conduct research. Teaching may also be included,
but up to no more than 20% of working hours. The
position shall include the opportunity for three weeks
of training in higher education teaching and learning.

POSTDOC IN QUANTITATIVE and POPULATION
GENETICS, Institut Pasteur, Paris
The Quintana-Murci laboratory (Unit of Human Evo-
lutionary Genetics, CNRS UMR2000) is recruiting a
post-doctoral researcher in quantitative and population
genetics at Institut Pasteur, Paris. Our research is fo-
cused on how natural selection, human demography
and lifestyle have shaped the patterns of diversity of
the human genome and, ultimately, phenotype varia-
tion and disease risk (https://research.pasteur.fr/en/-
team/human-evolutionary-genetics/). Specically, our
projects aim to increase our understanding of (i) the
genetic and evolutionary determinants of phenotype
variation, (ii) the occurrence of natural selection, in
its dierent forms and (iii) the demography history of
human populations, with a focus on Africa and the
Pacic.
The current postdoc project will be focused on exploring
both the genetic architecture of phenotype variation in
Polynesians (height, metabolic functions, skin pigmen-
tation, immune response, etc.) and the evolutionary
mechanisms that aect their distribution. The objec-
tive is to determine if population dierences in these
quantitative traits are the result of genetic drift or past
or ongoing directional selection, a question that is key
to understand human health disparities in the Pacic.
This proposal, which combines quantitative genetics,
population genetics, computational modelling and the
development of statistical frameworks, will shed new
light into the mechanisms of human genetic adaptation,
during their last journey into uninhabited lands.
Requirements: - Ph.D. in quantitative genomics, sta-
tistical genetics, population genetics, bioinformatics,
or computational biology - Strong programming and
bioinformatics skills (R and Bash scripting, cluster com-
puting) - Prociency in English.
Duration: 2 years funding are available, and support will
be provided to become self-nanced through competitive
fellowship applications.
Application Procedure: E-mail a CV, motivation let-
ter and three reference names (in a single pdf le) to
quintana@pasteur.fr by **November 30, 2021**.
Please put \Postdoc Quantitative Genetics" in the sub-ject line of your email. Interviews will be held soon after
this date. The starting date can be any time during
spring 2021.

ConvergenceGenomics
We are looking for two postdoctoral research associates
to work on a NERC-funded project \The genetic basis of
convergence across evolutionary time" led by Kanchon
Dasmahapatra at the University of York and Nicola
Nadeau at the University of Sheeld.
This project seeks to understand how the genetics of
convergent evolution diers with diering evolution-
ary timescales. We will determine whether the genetic
mechanism of convergence (collateral evolution, parallel
evolution and divergent genetic mechanisms) depends
on the relatedness of the species, the eect size of theloci involved and/or conservation of the genetic path-
ways controlling the phenotype. In South America there
are mimicry rings in which many defended species con-
verge on near identical colour patterns. This project
will investigate the genetic basis of convergent mimicry
in wing patterns among 18 species of butteries and
moths, which include the well-studied Heliconius but-
teries. This is a unique system in the Lepidoptera in
which we know that some recently diverged lineages
have converged in defensive colouration by collateral
evolution, whereas other clades have achieved similar
phenotypes despite diverging over 100 million years ago.
This provides an ideal model system in which to explore
the likelihood of dierent mechanisms of convergence
among lineages at a range of evolutionary timescales.
One of the PDRAs will be based in Sheeld, supervised
by Nicola Nadeau (http://nadeau-lab.group.shef.ac.uk).
This postdoc will lead the bioinformatic analysis of pop-
ulation genomic and gene expression data sets to identify
genes controlling within-species colour-pattern variation
in multiple species of ithomiine butteries and Chetone
day-ying moths.

*22-month post-doctoral position - Measurement of the
evolution of the genetic load during biological invasions
using population genomics approaches.*
/*Work environment, missions and activities*/
Context: Biological invasions are a major component of
global change. Yet, it is still not understood why some
introduced populations become invasive and others do
not. Demographic processes appear to be a key factor:
after the introduction of small numbers of individuals
into a new environment, levels of inbreeding and drift
increase signicantly, and deleterious mutations may
become exposed to natural selection. This can have
two opposite consequences: either xation or purging
of deleterious mutations. One hypothesis in invasion
biology is that the populations that will actually be-
come invasive are those that have purged some of their
deleterious alleles.
Project objective: Using genomic data already available
or being acquired by the host team, the post-doctoral
fellow will be in charge of population genomics analyses
aiming at quantitatively and qualitatively comparing
the genetic load of native and invasive populations of
a dozen insect species. The post-doctoral fellow will
have the opportunity to propose and explore dierent
methodologies and analyses to evaluate (i) the evolution
of the genetic load during the invasion of each species,
and (ii) the generality of the observed features thanks
to the multispecies approach.
Available resources and expected analyses: The position
is funded by the ANR GENLOADICS project. Sequenc-
ing of native and invasive populations (WGS pool-seq)
of at least ve species will already be available at the be-
ginning of the post-doc. Five to seven additional species
will be sequenced during the course of the contract.
The post-doctoral fellow will have access to computing
servers and clusters. The expected analyses are the
following: (i) identication of polymorphism from WGS
sequencing data of pools of individuals; (ii) polariza-
tion of identied alleles based on sequences of closely
related species; (iii) identication and categorization ofOctober 1, 2021 EvolDir 105
neutral and deleterious alleles; (iv) characterization of
the demographic history of populations (invasion routes,
bottlenecks severity), (v) quantication and comparison
of the genetic load of native and invasive populations,
and (vi) analysis of all 10 to 12 species studied in or-
der to identify possible generic patterns that could be
associated with the success of biological invasions.
Scientic environment: The post-doctoral fellow will be
hosted for a period of 22 months at the Institut Sophia
Agrobiotech (ISA), INRAE PACA, in Sophia-Antipolis,
France. The work will be performed in the Biology of In-
troduced Populations (BPI) team, which includes about
ten permanent sta (researchers, engineers, technicians)
working in the elds of evolutionary biology, population
genetics, ecology and bioinformatics. ^ a e
/*Candidate requirements*/
Education required: PhD in population genet-
ics/genomics or evolutionary biology. Skills: The post-
doc will have a strong background in bioinformatics and
population genomics, programming (R, perl, python
...) and writing skills. He/she should be independent,
autonomous and willing to work in a group. Additional
experience appreciated: Experience in the eld of inva-
sion biology is a plus.

UCalifornia SanDiego Microbiomes
A postdoctoral position is available in the Jackrel Lab in
the Division of Biological Sciences - Section of Ecology,
Behavior and Evolution at UC San Diego. Start date is
exible. The position is available for one year, and re-
newable for up to four years dependent on progress. This
candidate will pursue avenues related to an NIH-funded
research program aimed at advancing our understanding
of the role of host genetics and the environment in reg-
ulating assembly of microbial communities, short-term
changes in these communities through ecological succes-
sion, and long-term changes through evolutionary pro-
cesses. In order to better understand complex biological
networks, our lab seeks to elucidate the underlying struc-
ture of ecological interactions within host microbiomes
in order to predict when and how microbiomes might
confer benecial versus deleterious functions associated
with their host. Our lab aims to advance fundamental
understanding of host-microbiomes by leveraging single-
celled eukaryotic phytoplankton as a highly-tractable
experimental system. We seek a postdoctoral scholar
to:
(1) Harness the diversity of phytoplankton with bacterial
-omics approaches to test how microbiomes assemble in
response to host genetics. Use bacterial gene expression
responses to host genetics, in tandem with uctuating
environmental conditions, to determine the host genetic
x environmental forces that drive microbiome assembly
of eukaryotic microbiomes.
(2) Evaluate mechanisms of microbiome change for main-
tenance of host homeostasis in uctuating environments,
including ecological shifts in bacterial taxonomic compo-
sition, shifts in bacterial gene expression, and bacterial
strain evolution.
(3) Leverage classic community ecology theory to char-
acterize traits of transient versus stable microbiome net-
works. Quantify bacteria-bacteria interaction strengths
within naturally assembled and engineered microbiomes
to understand how network structure contributes to
transitions between host health and disease states.
Qualications:
- Ph.D. or equivalent degree in Microbiology, Ecology,
Evolution, Genetics or related elds.
- Expertise in one or more of the following is desired (and108 EvolDir October 1, 2021
broadly dened): empirical community ecology, eld
and lab-based environmental microbiology, bacterial
gene surveys, metagenomics, or metatranscriptomics.
- Familiarity with R for statistical analyses and data
visualization.
- Ability to work independently to conduct an indepen-
dent research project, as well as willingness to mentor
graduate and undergraduate students.

UCambridge MothPolymorphism
A post-doctoral research associate position is available
in the Department of Zoology from 1 Jan 2021 or as
soon as possible thereafter, to work with Professor Chris
Jiggins on the genetic basis for life history and morpho-
logical traits in the tiger moth Arctia plantaginis.
The moth has a male colour polymorphism which is also
associated with other life history and behavioural traits
including chemical signals, mating behaviour of males
and mate preferences. This complex polymorphism is
a puzzle as our preliminary analysis shows no evidence
for a supergene or large associated genetic locus. The
PDRA will work on the genetic basis of traits associ-
ated with colour dierences, to identify genomic regions
showing association with phenotype.
This work will be carried out as part of a BBSRC-funded
project, in collaboration with Prof Johanna Mappes at
the University of Helsinki. The Mappes group has devel-
oped this species into an exciting system with extensive
ecological background and potential for rearing large
numbers of individuals. Large collections of wild sam-
ples are also available.
The project will include quantitative genetic analysis
of life history and behavioural traits, QTL analysis of
chemical data on pheromones and defensive chemicals
and morphology including larval and adult colour pat-terns, and genetic analysis of wild samples; analysing
and writing up the results for publication.
Please see here for more info https://-

BalancedLethalSystemGenomics
The Institute of Biology Leiden at Leiden University
and Naturalis Biodiversity Center are looking for a post-
doctoral researcher - in the European Research Council-
funded project BALANCED LETHALS - to determine
the genomic architecture at the basis of an evolutionary
enigma: the balanced lethal system in the salamander
genus Triturus (the crested and marbled newts).
Balanced lethal systems represent an evolutionaryOctober 1, 2021 EvolDir 111
enigma because they are incredibly maladaptive. Two
distinct forms of a chromosome are required for survival,
meaning that only heterozygotes are viable, while ho-
mozygotes - half of the total reproductive output - perish.
Triturus newts are the most illustrious example. Two
non-recombining forms of chromosome 1, 1A and 1B, are
involved. The unfortunate homozygous ospring that
possess either chromosome 1A or 1B twice experience
developmental arrest and die halfway through normal
embryogenesis. Half of the eggs a female Triturus newt
lays never hatch!
The candidate will combine data obtained with Oxford
nanopore sequencing, Hi-C chromosome conformation
capture and high-resolution linkage mapping to assem-
ble the ~32Gb Triturus genome into chromosomes and
determine the genomic architecture underlying the bal-
anced lethal system. All required samples are available
and lab work is outsourced.
Selection criteria
- PhD degree in biology with proven experience in bioin-
formatics and whole genome assembly and annotation;
- A good command of the English language and proven
writing abilities;
- Highly motivated and capable of working both inde-
pendently and as part of a team.

Postdoc: EXILE - University of A odAo- Department
of Ecology and Vertebrate Zoology
REMINDER - DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF
APPLICATIONS: 20 October 2021
An exciting postdoctoral position funded by the Pol-
ish National Science Centre (NCN, grant EXILE) is
available at the Department of Ecology and Verte-
brate Zoology of the University of A odAo(Poland)
under the supervision of Philippe Kok (STELLAR Re-
search Group, see http://www.philippekok.com/stellar-October 1, 2021 EvolDir 113
research-group/). The position is oered for one year,
renewable for two further periods of one year (thus max
3 years) and is available from January 2022.
Brief scientic summary of the project: While poten-
tial responses of vertebrate communities to environ-
mental constraints have been widely tested in post-
Pleistocene landscapes, extrinsic and intrinsic drivers
of vertebrate population density in ancient insular ter-
restrial landscapes (fragmented paleosurfaces) are es-
sentially unknown. The overarching objective of this
project (acronym EXILE for EXobIoLogy on Earth)
is to explore, document and understand how environ-
mentally hostile naturally fragmented paleosurfaces may
have driven/altered peculiar behavioural, bio-physical
and eco-physiological adaptations, and ultimately the
evolutionary trajectories of vertebrates. EXILE fo-
cusses on the \Lost World" moonlike tabletop moun-
tains of northern South America (tepuis). We hypothe-
size that ancient endemic lineages of vertebrates thriv-
ing on these paleosurfaces, such as the toad genus
Oreophrynella and the lizard genus Riolama, have
developed unique behavioural, bio-physical and eco-
physiological traits/strategies to cope with the tepuis'
highly contrasted environmental conditions. EXILE
stems from our previous work in this unique system
and was inspired by unconventional ndings, testimony
to the tremendous research discoveries yet to be made
in this unusual ecosystem. It is well known that body
temperature and water balance are jointly inuenced by
heat and water exchange within the organism and be-
tween the organism and its environment. This exchange
is modulated by (i) the biophysical and physiological
properties of the organism and by (ii) behavioural strate-
gies. Biophysical properties include morphology, surface
properties, and metabolic modes. For instance, skin
colour, thickness, and ultrastructure in reptiles and am-
phibians determine heating capacity and resistance to
water loss. EXILE will specically focus on two main
complementary research axes: (1) thermal biology, and
(2) bio-physical adaptations to dehydration. We will
use selected Pantepui amphibians and reptiles on a sin-
gle tepui summit at ca. 2,800 m elevation. In order
to situate these results in the appropriate ecological
and evolutionary context, we will also investigate non-
insular upland (ca. 1,000 m elevation) closely-related
taxa in the surrounding Pantepui tropical rainforest,
as well as the closest relatives of the tepui taxa living
in a Neotropical post-Pleistocene landscape at similar
elevation (ca. 2,800 m elevation in the sub-paramo in
the Andes). Field expeditions coupled with the use of
advanced techniques such as highly sensitive thermal
imagery, including the use of drones to record thermal
images of the landscapes from the air, will be carriedout to complete our project. We will also run a va-
riety of cutting-edge behavioural tests, either in the
native environment of the animals or in our eld lab-
oratory, and use modern imagery techniques (such as
high-resolution X-ray microcomputed tomography and
electronic microscopy).

ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/les/listy-rankingowe/2020-

an eye for the details and excellent organisational
skills. The successful candidate will have a PhD in
biological or closely related science and experience in

Delphine Bonnet, at the MARBEC Laboratory in the
Universit e de Montpellier, France. This project is in-
tegrated with Carol Lee's NSF-funded project at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison.
This project focuses on Rapid Evolutionary Responses
to Global Change using the copepod Eurytemora anis114 EvolDir October 1, 2021
species complex as a model system. With changes in
global climate, coastal high latitude waters are expe-
riencing rapid declines in salinity, due to increases in
ice melt and precipitation. In addition, populations are
experiencing salinity decline during saline to freshwa-
ter invasions. We have found evolutionary shifts in ion
transport function, genome-wide gene expression, and
population genomic signatures of selection associated
with these changes in salinity (see pubs in the links
below).
This postdoc project will entail conducting a genetic
association study to link candidate alleles with tness-
related traits. Across multiple studies in the Lee Lab,
the largest functional category of genes under selection
during the salinity shifts are ion transporters. The goal
of this study is to identify the impacts of specic ion
transporter paralog alleles on salinity tolerance and per-
formance. The experimental procedure involves crossing
copepod lines adapted to dierent salinities to the F2
generation to dissociate genetic loci, followed by data
collection of tness-related traits and genotypes of ion
transport paralogs. We will later use the results to input
into models of evolutionary rescue in the Baltic Sea dur-
ing its freshening due to climate change. The postdoc
will work alongside a technician and Ph.D. student, who
are already trained on this project.
The ideal candidate should hold a Ph.D. and have
publications in peer-reviewed journals. Relevant areas
of expertise include quantitative genetics, laboratory-
controlled experiments (e.g. association studies, ex-
perimental evolution, or common-garden experiments),
culturing (e.g. copepods and algae), and statistics.
Review of applications will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is lled. The appointment
could persist for up to two years. Interested candi-
dates should email their application to Prof. Carol Lee
(carollee@wisc.edu), including: (1) a CV, (2) a list of
references (recommenders), and (3) samples of rst au-
thored publications. Enquiries regarding this position
are most welcome.

diversity may be aected by environmental variables
such as habitat size, urban areas, connectivity etc. One
of the aims of this project is to quantify the eect of
these environmental variables. The project is focused
on urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden, which
were surveyed with regard to biodiversity (invertebrates
and amphibians) and environmental variables. Data col-
lection is already completed and will be analyzed using
advanced multivariate statistics. You will use genomic
data already obtained through ddRADseq (with DNA
methylation-sensitive enzymes), as well as community
ecology data (already collected). The two datasets will
be used to quantify genetic variation, genetic structure,
and species diversity as well as the association between
these.

the Dominican Republic
Summary The postdoctoral scholar will join a col-laborative team of researchers elucidating how Ano-
lis lizard niches evolve along dietary, habitat (vege-
tation structure), and temperature axes. The post-
doc will be primarily based out of the Frishko Lab
(www.frishkoab.com) at the University of Texas at
Arlington, but will collaborate closely with researchers
in the laboratories of Martha Mu noz (Yale University)
and Luke Mahler (University of Toronto). Anolis lizards
form diverse communities on the islands of the Greater
Antilles in the Caribbean. But why some species both
dominate local communities, and are geographically
widespread within individual islands, is unclear. As
part of a three-year NSF-funded project, the postdoc
will characterize species' geographic distributions, local
abundances in communities, and niche breadths in three
replicate adaptive radiations across Puerto Rico, Ja-
maica, and the Dominican Republic. In particular, the
postdoc will lead the characterization of anoles' commu-
nity structures and their dietary niches with respect to
their insect prey, though will be involved in project ac-
tivities related to the thermal and vegetation structural
niche as well.
Specically, the postdoc will be responsible for: * Co-
leading eld expeditions of 6-10 researchers to Puerto
Rico, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic to: - quan-
tify Anolis lizard abundance in standardized plot surveys
across environments on each island - collect insect com-
munity samples using sweep nets, pitfall traps, and other
methods - collect Anolis fecal samples for metagenomic
barcoding dietary analysis * Conducting analysis of Ano-
lis dietary niches through metagenomic barcoding and
sequencing of fecal samples at UTA. Additionally, the
post-doc will work with undergraduate team members
to: - Identify insects and assess total biomass and body
size distributions across sites - Sanger sequence represen-
tative insects from eld collections to build sequence-to-
specimen library * Managing resulting data * Analyzing
lizard dietary niche breadth in relation to lizard abun-
dance, environment, and insect availability across sites
* Preparing scientic manuscripts * Mentoring junior
researchers
Additionally, the postdoc will be encouraged to develop
independent ideas pertaining to Anolis lizards and/or
insect community ecology in the system. The postdoc
will collaborate closely with aliated labs, and will be
supported to travel to the University of Toronto for sev-
eral weeks as a visiting scholar to work collaboratively
on project activities and to develop skills in phylogenetic
comparative analysis with the Mahler Lab.
Initial appointment will be for one year, with the expec-
tation of extension for two additional years contingent
on performance.120 EvolDir October 1, 2021
Requirements: * PhD in ecology or related eld * Quan-
titative statistical skills and familiarity with analysis in
R * Excitement to conduct tropical eldwork in a vari-
ety of environments, sometimes with minimal amenities
* Strong communication skills, and ability to work both
as part of a team and independently * Demonstrated
capacity to develop, conduct, and complete projects, as
evidenced by a publication record
Preferred, but not required skills: * Experience with
tropical eld biology * Experience in entomology and

UVirginia CoevolutionaryGenetics
The Department of Biology at the University of Virginia
invites applicants for a post-doctoral Research Associate
position in the lab of Professor Amanda Gibson as part
of a 5-year NIH-funded project.
The big questions we're pursuing with this project are:
o How do organisms adapt to rampant uncertainty?
o In what ways does context, both environmental and
genetic, change the alleles that matter for tness?
o To what extent do these genetic interactions confound
our ability to map genotype to phenotype? (and can
we overcome this?)
We use resistance to coevolving parasites as a model trait
to get at these questions. The work makes use of the
experimental tools and resources available for the model
nematode C. elegans and its natural parasites, including
experimental evolution, cryogenic preservation, high-
throughput phenotyping, transgenic methods, wild iso-
lates with whole genome sequences, and public resources
for genetic mapping. You can nd read more about the

VirginiaTech ChestnutGenomics
Research Associate/Post-doc to study the genomics of
blight resistance in Castanea
Job Description The Holliday lab at Virginia Tech, in
collaboration with The American Chestnut Foundation
(TACF), is seeking a post-doctoral fellow for two years
to study the evolutionary genomics of chestnut blight
resistance in Castanea. At the turn of the twentieth
century, the introduction of the chestnut blight fungus
(Cryphonectria parasitica) killed approximately four bil-
lion American chestnuts in the forests of Eastern United
States. Asian Castanea species are resistant to chest-
nut blight whereas the North American and Europeanspecies are susceptible. We would like to better under-
stand the evolution and genetic networks underlying
blight resistance to enable gene editing to improve the
blight resistance of American chestnut. The successful
candidate will take the lead on the following analyses:
- Estimate phylogenies and divergence times among host
(Castanea spp.) and pathogen (Cryphonectria spp.) to
test alternative hypotheses about the evolution of blight
resistance. - From whole genome resequence data, detect
signatures of positive or balancing selection in blight
resistant Asian Castanea species that are absent or re-
duced in susceptible European and North American con-
geners. - Use RNA-seq timecourse data to compare gene
expression in the stems of Chinese chestnut, American
chestnut, and F1 hybrids of these species. Detect which
gene are dierentially expressed and determine whether
these expression dierences are regulated in cis or trans.
- Compare the annotated chromosome scale reference
genomes of American chestnut and Chinese chestnut to
detect presence/absence variants, copy number variants,
and non- synonymous, and potentially deleterious alleles
in genes and pathways hypothesized to be important
for blight resistance. - Use machine-learning approaches
to integrate data sources and discover candidate genes
involved in resistance. Specically, integrate QTL map-
ping of resistance in hybrid populations, dierential gene
expression analyses, signatures of natural selection, and
comparative genomic evidence.
Note that the above data are or will be in hand soon.
No data generation or lab work will be expected.
Required qualications - Ph.D. in population genomics,
computational biology, or a related eld - Experience
and/or desire to learn bioinformatics, phylogenomics,
population genomics, dierential gene expression anal-
yses, and machine learning. - Expertise in R, Python,
and Linux scripting and implementation on high perfor-
mance computing clusters

I am happy to announce that the graduate course on
\Quantitative Evolutionary Genetics" is open for applica-
tions. The course is part of the IMaLiS master's program
of the Ecole Normale Sup erieure (ENS) in Paris, and
it will be held in-person at the Department of Biology
of the ENS, 46 Rue d'Ulm, 75014 Paris France; from
Monday, December 6th to Friday, December 17th, 2021.
Attendance of the course is free and European students
will be able to credit 6 ECTS.
This is a course that will cover the fundamental biologi-
cal and mathematical concepts of quantitative genetics,
as applied to the evolution of complex traits. The stu-
dents will learn several models of quantitative genetics
and how to partition and estimate the components of
phenotypic variation, as well as the statistical study
of these components (animal model) and of selection
and selection trait responses (Robertson-Price identity).
The course will discuss several advanced topics such
as genomic selection, genome-wide association analysis
and multivariate evolution (G-matrix, M-matrix, adap-
tive landscapes). We will study modern applications
of quantitative genetics to understand selection and
genetic drift in experimental and natural populations,
particularly in the context of climate change. A large
part of the second week of the course will be devoted to
computer modelling the evolution of complex traits in
tutored projects.
The faculty will be composed of Diala Abu Awad (Uni-
versit e Paris-Saclay), Alain Charcosset (INRAE), Chris-
tine Dillmann (Universit e Paris-Saclay), Arnaud Le
Rouzic (CNRS), Maud Tenaillon (CNRS), Henrique
Teot onio (ENS) and Pierre de Villemereuil (EPHE).
As prerequisites for the course, students will have the
background in population genetics and quantitative ge-
netics, and a keen interest in the mathematical founda-tions of evolutionary theory. Students will further have
a basic understanding of statistical inference and some

ConservationGeneticsInTheTropics
Oct18-29
We are happy to announce Conservation Genetics in the
Tropics 2021, which will be all online this year.
Many conservation genetics tools have been developed
for use in temperate other high latitude habitats, and so
not all of these tools translate to the tropics. Tropical
habitats share some features which complicate the ap-
plication of some conservation genetics tools which are
heavily relied upon in higher latitudes, and also share
some basic questions and problems that are less of an
issue in higher latitudes or other, better studies and/ or
less diverse habitats.
This course will discuss practical issues, genetic and
genomic theory, tools and analyses as applied to issues
relevant to conservation in the tropics. Some basic
questions of conservation importance include describ-
ing species diversity, determining species distributions,
characterizing the basic biology of species, and under-
standing demographic history and population size and
structure. Underlying biogeographic histories that have
shaped communities, and the biotic interactions within
those communities are also of fundamental importance.
There are optional online computer practicals in parallel
with the lectures, seminars and discussions.
This course is designed with students and practitioners
of Conservation Biology or Conservation Genetics in the
tropical regions of America, Africa and Asia in mind.124 EvolDir October 1, 2021

a quick introduction to Julia and to the jPANDA Julia
package.
The RPANDA package contains tools for macroevolu-
tionary analyses on phylogenetic trees, in particular for
the analysis of diversication and trait evolution from
comparative data.
The instructors will introduce the theory behind these
analyses, run practicals with illustrative examples, and
guide the interpretation of the output of these analyses.
This workshop is primarily intended for (but is not
exclusive to) graduate students and postdocs. Partici-
pants are encouraged to bring their own phylogenetic
datasets (with potentially matching trait, biogeographic
and paleoenvironmental datasets).

The University of Connecticut's Computational Biology
Core is oering a workshop on assaying genetic vari-
ation using restriction-associated DNA sequencing, or
RAD-Seq.
The workshop will cover basic concepts and walk
through a complete analysis on a high performance
computing cluster. The analysis will start with raw
reads and go through some very basic analyses of pop-
ulation genetic structure. The core learning goal is to
familiarize attendees with the steps necessary to ana-
lyze RAD-seq data, the tools available, common data
formats, and possible pitfalls they may encounter.
We'll use data collected from a landscape genetic study
of arctic grayling, a marine sh, using the ddRAD
method (Peterson et al. 2012). All code required to
complete the full analysis will be provided in a pub-
lic github repository, and sessions recordings will be
available to all participants after the workshop.
The workshop will take place over 4 days for three hours
each day.
Dates: September 13-16 (4 days)
Time: 9.00am - 12.00pm

Online SexChromosomeEvolution
Feb14-18
Dear all,
registrazions are now open for our online \Sex Chro-
mosome Evolution"course : ( https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/sexchr/ )
Dates: 14-18 February 2022
This course will introduce attendees to how the genomic
and transcriptomic data can be used to detect homomor-
phic/heteromorphic sex chromosomes and inform the
cause and consequences of sex chromosome dierentia-
tion. The instructors will guide students through study
design, genomic/transcriptomic data collection methods,
handling of raw genomic/transcriptomic data, and meth-
ods to identify sex chromosomes. Then, we will work
through a suite of analyses looking at the molecular evo-
lution of sex chromosomes, particularly the timing and
patterns of recombination suppression, gene gain/loss,
gene expression dierentiation, and genome divergence.
We will provide background on the theory and hands-
on exercises, running analysis, and interpreting results.
After completing the course, the participants should be
able to manipulate, visualize and interpret genomic data
and patterns of sex chromosome evolution.

Course Overview:
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) are a pow-
erful machine learning technique with very promising
potential applications in ecology and biogeography in
general, and in species distribution modelling (SDM)
in particular. Unlike most other SDM methods, BART
models can generally provide a well-balanced perfor-
mance regarding both main aspects ofpredictive accu-
racy, namely discrimination (i.e. distinguishing presence
from absence localities) and calibration (i.e., having pre-
dicted probabilities reect the species&#39; gradual
occurrence frequencies). BART can generate accurate
predictions without overtting to noise or to particular
cases in the data. As it is a cutting-edge technique in
this eld, BART is not yet routinely included in SDM
workows or in ensemble modelling packages. This130 EvolDir October 1, 2021
course will include 1) an introduction or refresher on
the essentials of the R language; 2) an introduction
or refresher on species distribution modelling; 3) an
overview of SDM methods of dierent complexity, in-
cluding regression-based and machine-learning (both
Bayesian and non-Bayesian) methods; 4) SDM build-
ing and block cross-validation focused on dierent as-
pects of model performance, including discrimination
and calibration or reliability. We will use R packages
&#39;embarcadero&#39;, &#39;fuzzySim&#39; and
&#39;modEvA&#39; to see how BART can perform
well when all these aspects are equally important, as well
as to identify relevant predictors, map prediction un-
certainty, plot partial dependence curves with Bayesian
credible intervals, and map relative probability of pres-
ence regarding particular predictors. Students will apply
all these techniques to their own species distribution
data, or to example data that will be provided during
the course.
Intended Audience
Any researchers (PhD and MSc students, post-docs,
primary investigators) and environmental professionals
who are interested in implementing best practices and
state-of-the-art methods for modelling species' distribu-
tions or ecological niches, with applications to biogeog-
raphy, evolutionary biology, spatial ecology, biodiversity
conservation and related disciplines.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.October 1, 2021 EvolDir 131
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
