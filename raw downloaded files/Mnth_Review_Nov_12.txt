6th International Macrostomum Meeting: Evolution
and Development in the free-living atworm genus
Macrostomum
We are happy to announce the \6th International
Macrostomum Meeting" here in Basel. The meeting
will last from Friday, 16.11.2012 at 18:00 to Sunday,
18.11.2012 at around 16:00.
The \International Macrostomum Meeting" brings to-
gether annually the growing community of researchers
that are either using atworms of the genus Macros-
tomum in their research or who are otherwise inter-
ested in research on this emerging model organism. The
meeting oers a great opportunity to get an update on
what is happening in the Macrostomum Community,
and to establish personal contacts if you consider to
start working on these lovely worms.
The contributed talks and posters (see the form be-
low) are expected to span ageing, bioadhesion, develop-
ment, evolution, genomics, transcriptomics, transgene-
sis, regeneration, neurobiology, ecotoxicology, system-
atics, phylogenetics, and sexual selection.
As in earlier meetings, we aim at keeping everything assimple and cheap as possible, and we therefore expect
everyone to cover their own costs. We will collect a
small fee (about 50 Euros) from each participant dur-
ing the meeting to cover sandwich lunches, refreshments
and a joint dinner on the Saturday evening.
For the students we will try to nd oor space ac-
commodation in apartments of members of the Sch arer
Group. Please let us know if you would like to be ac-
commodated in this way (see the form below).
The other people should make a hotel reservation soon,
because there are many fairs in Basel, and hotels can
ll up quickly. We suggest that you book your room in
the Hotel Rochat, where we routinely host guests that
visit our department (http://www.hotelrochat.ch), and
where we therefore have special rates (CHF 125.- for
singles and 180.- for doubles). The Hotel Rochat is just
ve minutes by foot from the Institute. Please contact
them directly to make your arrangements/payments,
and please mention the Zoological Institute when you
book to get the special rates.
For people coming by plane, please note
that Easyjet (http://www.easyjet.com), Swiss
(http://www.swiss.com), and AirBerlin (http://-
www.airberlin.com/) y to Basel from many European
destinations (e.g. Hamburg, London, Amsterdam,
Brussels, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona etc.).
If you would like to attend the meeting, and maybe
present your research, please ll out and return the formNovember 1, 2012 EvolDir 3
below to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch until 19. October at
the latest.
We are looking forward to seeing you soon in Basel,

NeotropicalBiogeography Jan14
*2nd meeting of the Network for Neotropical Biogeog-
raphy*
* *
*Theme: Integrating Neotropical Research*
*Venue:* Montgomery Botanical Center, Coral Gables,
Miami, Florida, USA
*Date: *January 14th, 2013 (immediately after the 6th
Biennial meeting of the International Biogeography So-
ciety)
*Organizers: *Christine Bacon and Alexandre An-
tonelli (http://antonelli-lab.net)
*Rationale: *Tropical America (the Neotropics) oers
a splendid opportunity for studying evolution and bio-
geography. The region's outstanding biodiversity, its
comparatively well-known geological history, the rela-
tive ease of travelling and conducting eldwork (with
Spanish as a lingua franca), and the rapid increase
in highly competent Latin American biologists and
well-equipped institutions, all contribute to making the
Neotropics a great research arena for a new generation
of students and established researchers alike.
Despite an increasing amount of interest, there is lim-
ited coordination and interactions among independentresearch groups. This is unfortunate given the sci-
entic and spatial dimensions of Neotropical research
and the scarce funding available. This one-day meeting
aims at improving this situation by *bringing together
representatives for as many research groups as pos-
sible* working on Neotropical biogeography and evo-
lution - regardless of methodology, data source, spa-
tial/temporal scale, or organismal group studied. Talks
will therefore be welcome from the elds of molecular
phylogenetics, paleontology, ecology, etc.
Each *research group* will be given a time slot (e.g., 20
minutes) to present their *current and planned activi-
ties*, which will be followed by discussion for feedback
and possible interactions with the other participants
(e.g. joint eldwork, material exchange, scholarships,
etc). The presentations can be done by each group's PI
and/or group members.
There is *no need to submit an abstract; *but you
must* send a title*(preferably the project title) and the
number of other attendees from your lab group to con-
rm your participation to Christine Bacon as soon as
possible, and *by October 31st,* at the latest. Please
await a conrmation for the symposium before book-
ing any extra hotel nights or ights, as the maximum
number of participants is restricted to 60 (due to space
constraints).
*Transportation* will be arranged between the IBC
2013 partner hotel (Newport Beachside Resort; http:/-
/www.newportbeachsideresort.com/) and the meet-
ing site (Montgomery Botanical Center; http://-
www.montgomerybotanical.org/).
The *meeting fee* will be calculated depending on the
number of registered participants but will be kept as
low as possible. A separate fee will apply for the din-
ner (a *Cuban esta to not miss!*).
*Feel* *free to distribute this announcement* to any-
one who could be potentially interested!

The International Symposium:
The International Symposium will celebrate 30 years
of Thornhill and Alcock's ground-breaking book The
Evolution of Insect Mating Systems. The book has had
an enormous impact on multiple generations of ento-
mologists and behavioural ecologists, and we will cel-
ebrate that achievement and explore the progress we
have made in understanding insect mating systems and
reproductive behaviour since 1983. The original book
covered many aspects of insect mating systems, from
the evolution of sex and sexual systems, through to how
ecology and sexual selection interact to shape the mat-
ing systems we see. Much has happened in the three
decades since the book was published, including ma-
jor advances in our understanding of the evolution of
sex, sexual selection (especially mate choice and post-
copulatory sexual selection), the mechanistic basis of
reproductive behaviour, and of course sexual conict.
Insects have played a major role in all these develop-
ments, as the symposium and the accompanying vol-
ume will highlight.

ABSTRACT:
Elucidating the evolutionary implications of epigenetic
signals promises to signicantly improve our under-
standing of the mechanisms underlying natural phe-
notypic variation and organismic adaptive strategies.
Recent investigations already integrate epigenetics in
population genetics, evolutionary biology and ecology,
particularly when studying biotic responses to changing
environmental conditions. The reality of transgenera-
tional epigenetic inheritance in a broad variety of organ-
isms currently challenges the gene-centered view that
still dominates the evolutionary thinking about varia-
tion, adaptation and evolution. Accordingly, our focus
in the study of evolution is shifting from single genes to
developmental/regulatory networks and holistic pheno-
types.
Additional related topics will be discussed in other sym-
posia and workshops oered at BioSyst.Eu2013 - to
give only few examples: \Biotic responses to climate
change", \Evo-devo", \Processes of diversication and
speciation", \Hybrid evolution and speciation", etc.
The Evolutionary Epigenetics symposium is being
sponsored by the Linnean Society of London, which is
greatly appreciated.

STRACT: Elucidating processes of diversication
and speciation is paramount for our understanding
of how the tremendous biodiversity observable today
has originated and how it may react to threats and
challenges imposed by human activities now and in
the future. Technological advances with respect to
data generation (e.g., next-generation sequencing,
sophisticated analytical tools) as well as conceptual
advancements (e.g., modes and models of speciation)
set an excitingly powerful framework for studying
those processes (e.g., hybrid and polyploid speciation,
ecological speciation, sexual selection) in and beyond
model organisms.
Additional related topics will be discussed in other sym-
posia and workshops oered at BioSyst.Eu2013, which
include, among others, \Biotic responses to climate
change", \Evo-devo", \Evolutionary epigenetics", \Hy-
brid evolution and speciation", \Phylogenetic meth-
ods"

Basel Switzerland SexualSelection
PhD position on 'Quantifying Sexual Selection in a Si-
multaneous Hermaphrodite'A 3-year full-time PhD position, funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation, is available in the group
of Lukas Scharer, at the Zoological Institute, Univer-
sity of Basel, Switzerland (http://evolution.unibas.ch).
The ideal starting date is January 2013 (but there is
some exibility regarding this).
Our research focuses on the evolutionary ecology
of reproduction in simultaneous hermaphrodites, us-16 EvolDir November 1, 2012
ing a highly suitable model organism, the free-
living marine atworm Macrostomum lignano (http://-
evolution.unibas.ch/scharer/). Our research integrates
a diversity of approaches, including controlled labo-
ratory experiments, molecular developmental biology,
quantitative genetics, genomics, eld work, molecular
phylogenetics and comparative methods. The practical
work for this PhD project will primarily involve breed-
ing experiments in the lab, a range of molecular biology
approaches, and some eld work in the Mediterranean
Sea.
One central aim of the project is to describe and
quantify sexual selection on dierent male and female
reproductive traits along the pre- to post-copulatory
axis, using a state of the art approach based on Bate-
man's principles that we have recently extended to
hermaphrodites (see Anthes et al. 2010, Am. Nat.).
Recently established transgenic GFP-expressing worms
now allow us to track the sperm cells of GFP-positive
sperm donors in their GFP-negative partners in vivo
(think 'watching sperm at work'), and we can use
the same GFP marker for extremely ecient paternity
analysis.
Moreover, we have recently established tools that al-
low us to manipulate dierent reproductive traits using
dosage-dependent RNA interference of specic repro-
ductive genes (see e.g. Sekii et al. 2009, BMC Dev
Biol). We are now taking advantage of next generation
sequencing approaches (whole-genome and transcrip-
tome sequencing, and gene expression studies using
RNAseq) to identify additional relevant genes. Thus
the other central aim of the project will be to experi-
mentally validate the importance of (at least some of)
the traits identied with the rst aim (think 'pheno-
typic engineering of sexually selected traits').
Finally, the work will be performed in collaboration
with a PostDoc to be hired on the same project. This
PostDoc will likely focus on the quantitative genetics,
genetic architecture, and indirect genetic eects of a
broad range of reproductive traits in this system, thus
complementing the aims of the project of the PhD stu-
dent. However, the specic interests, skills, and back-
grounds of the PhD and PostDoc candidates will have
a considerable inuence on the scope of the work, and
there is ample room for developing own ideas and ap-
proaches. The study system oer tremendous opportu-
nities for sexual selection and sexual conict research.
The successful PhD candidate will be independent, ded-
icated, inquisitive, creative, and collaborative. More-
over, he/she should have a keen interest in evolutionary
biology and must be willing to learn new techniques and
statistical approaches. Previous experience in molecu-lar biology is a clear advantage, but not a prerequisite.
A MSc or equivalent education level is required for this
PhD position and the handsome salary is in accordance
to the standards of the Swiss National Science Founda-
tion.
The Scharer group belongs to the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel, a
stimulating and highly international research environ-
ment with English as the predominant language (a re-
cent count yielded ~20 nationalities). The other groups
focus on host-parasite interactions (Ebert), speciation
in cichlids (Salzburger) and sticklebacks (Berner), evo-
lution of the immune system (Du Pasquier), behav-
ioral ecology of birds (Amrhein), and parent-ospring
conicts (K olliker) (see http://evolution.unibas.ch/-
research.htm). Our Institute has a strong background
in experimental design, statistics, population genetics,
quantitative genetics, genomics and molecular biology.
So it is an ideal place for a PhD candidate interested
in evolutionary biology.
Basel is the third largest city of Switzerland and attrac-
tively situated at the foot of the Jura mountain range.
It has the beautiful river Rhine, and directly borders
both Germany and France, thus oering rich culinary,
cultural, and outdoor possibilities.
To apply, please send a letter of motivation, a CV, con-
tact details of 2 referees, and a copy of your MSc-thesis
(if available) to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch (electronic ap-
plications in a single le are preferred). Reviewing of
applications starts on October 31, but applications will
be considered until the position is lled.

term research project funded by the *Science and In-
dustry Endowment Fund *running across * CSIRO*,November 1, 2012 EvolDir 17
*The University of Melbourne* and *Monash Univer-
sity*
- * *
- Four PhD projects are currently available:
- Genomics of climatic adaptation (*Drosophila* and
*Eucalypts*)
- Metabolomics of climatic adaptation
- Transcriptomics of climatic adaptation
-
- Interested candidates should contact:
- Prof John Oakeshott john.oakeshott@csiro.au

- Dr Carla Sgr o carla.sgro@monash.edu
* *
*PHD PROJECT OUTLINES*
*Drosophila as a model system for using genomic and
genetic techniques to understand climate adaptation (2
projects)*
Australian Drosophila species are good model systems
for developing new tools to understand the genetic ba-
sis of climate adaptation - questions about what (ge-
nomically) makes a climate specialist and a climate
generalist can be answered in this group because the
species vary enormously in their geographic range but
utilize similar resources. We have initiated a large
scale sequencing project that will provide genomic and
transcriptomic information across Drosophila clades,
and this represents an opportunity for student projects
to understand the nature of adaptive processes across
space and time. We are seeking students with an abil-
ity to think in novel ways about using these resources.
They might have interests in bioinformatics and/or eco-
logical genetics as an initial starting point.
*Metabolomics of climate stress responses in
Drosophila. *
A PhD student project is available to use cutting
edge metabolomic, and in particular lipidomic, tech-
nology in order to investigate the biochemical basis for
Drosophila species' various abilities to adapt to climate
stresses. The species come from a range of climatic
niches and show very dierent abilities to adapt to cli-
mate stresses. They will also have already been char-
acterised for the genetic, genomic and transcriptomic
bases for their responses to these stresses, and pre-
liminary results indicate that species conned to trop-
ical rainforest ecologies have much less heritability for
these responses. There is thus a range of unique re-sources and important preliminary results available for
the metabolomics to build on, which should provide
deep insights into the biochemical bases for adaptation.
Students interested in the project should have some
background or interest in linking biochemical methods
to ecology.
*Genomic basis for adaptation to climate stresses in
eucalypts.*
Eucalypts are foundation components of many Aus-
tralian ecosystems, so their ability to adapt to climate
change will be crucial to the resilience of the ecosys-
tems in the face of climate change. This project will use
next gen' sequencing technology to screen for genomic
variation across temperature and aridity gradients for a
key eucalypt species, and test for associations between
that variation and ecophysiological measures of climate
stress responses. Pre-existing plots of dierent biotypes
reared in common environments could also be tested.
The work will inform the potential of using these tech-
niques in building evolutionary resilience in populations
and ecosystems. Students interested in applying for
this project should have the ability to think across dis-
ciplines and have some background in molecular and/or
population/quantitative genetics, and a willingness to
undertake eld work.

with Root Gorelick at Carleton University in Ottawa,
please send me the following information, preferably in
a single e-mail attachment: (1) most importantly, a
thoughtful and passionate 1-2 page essay on why you
would like to pursue this degree and your vision of what
the research might entail, (2) your CV, (3) a scanned

manent residents of Canada.
MY VIEW: Much of modern western evolution and
ecology is reductionist and typological, despite being
about relationships amongst natural entities. Even
when taking on population perspectives, there is a fo-
cus on averages (vice outliers), competition (vice coop-
eration), single species (vice communities), and single
hierarchal levels. Turtle Island Indigenous peoples de-
veloped detailed and robust evolutionary and ecological
frameworks that are often dierent from each other and
from western views. Dierences can be due to local con-
ditions (e.g. northern tundra versus southern desert),
with substantial emphasis on spatially local knowledge,
especially compared with global perspectives of west-
ern colonial traditions. Dierences may be due to false
dichotomies between natural and social science and be-
tween humans and other organisms. Western science
may be too negative, relying on the oundering philo-
sophical framework of falsication and on killing and
imprisoning many animals and plants, whereas Indige-
nous sciences seem to oer more positive and construc-
tive approaches. Did dierent epistemologies and on-
tologies arise because of dierences in spatial and tem-
poral scales, dierences in domestication of animals, or
gynocratic world-views? In Indigenous versus western
studies of evolution, why is there usually a very dif-
ferent emphasis on origin, as opposed to maintenance,
of entities and traits? Do Indigenous ways of know-
ing parallel western theory and natural history, which
often seem detached from western scientic method?
By comparing and contrasting multiple perspectives,
can we improve each of the frameworks for understand-
ing evolutionary and ecological patterns and processes,
thereby better understanding the natural world, our-
selves, and our communities?

Edinburgh EvolutionVirulence
Sociality
Hello,
I have just advertised a funded PhD position on
Findaphd, deadline 18 Jan (funding for UK stu-
dents only). (see http://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=3D40720&LID=3D455 )
The advertisement focuses on the 'evolution of viru-
lence' question, however I want to stress that the fo-
cus will be very much on the bacterial traits that un-
derlie virulence, with a big emphasis on social, co-
operative traits (expression of secreted virulence fac-
tors), and on plasticity (regulatory control of virulence
factors). For more general info on what we do, see
brown.bio.ed.ac.uk. Any questions, please email.
best wishes, Sam Brown
Findaphd advert: Molecular, ecological and evolution-
ary dynamics of bacterial virulence.
Bacterial pathogens are very often pathogens by acci-
dent - typically growing in distinct environments caus-
ing no harm to humans. The major challenge in this
proposal is to further our understanding of virulence
evolution in opportunistic pathogens, including com-
mensal and environmental bacteria.
The evolution of virulence is a major focus in evo-
lutionary biology, and has resulted in a large body
of theory based on the assumption that virulence is
a result of selection for virulence factors (VFs) that
enhance within-host growth, survival or between-host
transmission. While this theory has met with suc-cess for specialist pathogens (e.g. malaria), for many
opportunistic pathogens these proposed countervailing
growth/transmission benets of VF expression are dif-
cult to identify in hosts, casting a large body of theory
into doubt.
To answer this challenge, our lab aims to develop and
test novel theoretical frameworks for virulence dynam-
ics across multiple environments, to capture the en-
vironmental and regulatory complexity of virulence in
bacterial opportunistic pathogens and to identify novel
and evolutionarily robust methods of pathogen control.
Opportunities for experimental and/or theoretical ap-
proaches exist in the lab. A general aim is to foster an
integrative training spanning molecular microbiology,
systems biology, ecology and evolution.

ences Program is looking for highly motivated graduate
students with an interest in evolutionary biology, ma-
rine invertebrates and molecular methods.
Research Interests
The Bracken-Grissom Lab is fundamentally interested
in the evolution of marine invertebrates with an empha-
sis in decapod crustaceans. Specically, our present
research combines molecular, morphological and fos-
sil evidence to gain insights into evolutionary rela-
tionships (phylogeny), biogeography, biodiversity, ecol-
ogy, origins and diversication of crabs, lobsters and
shrimp. As part of this research, we have been devel-
oping and applying novel methods for DNA sequenc-November 1, 2012 EvolDir 21
ing using next-generation technology and directed se-
quencing. More recently, we have been exploring vi-
sual systems and structures involved in marine biolu-
minescence using deep-sea shrimp as model organisms.
Present awarded grants propose to study the eects of
the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill on the Gulf of Mex-
ico coastal and deep bank ecosystems. We are using
gene expression studies and transcriptomics to assess
the stress response of nearshore decapod crustaceans
to increased oil exposure.
Qualications
Applicants should have a background in evolutionary
biology and molecular methods. Experience with inver-
tebrate zoology, phylogenetics, systematics, next gen-
eration sequencing methods and/or bioinformatics is a
plus. Students would ideally have a B.S. degree in Biol-
ogy or related discipline. Student must be procient in
English (both spoken and written). Our work requires
good organizational and computational skills and the
ability to work collaboratively as part of a team. Oc-
casional physically demanding eldwork may also be
required to support research.
Requirements
The Bracken-Grissom lab is looking for 2 gradu-
ate students to start in the Fall of 2013. PhD
candidates are preferred but students interested in
pursuing an MS degree are welcome to apply. If
you are interested in applying for a graduate posi-
tion in my lab, please send a letter of interest to

OrangutanConservation
PhD Position available at the Masaryk University in
Brno.
Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic has open-
ings for several students to conduct research on
orangutan parasitic infections.This is the rst research project to investigate special
behaviours and ecological conditions necessary to main-
tain health in wild orangutans. In addition, it is the
only on-going and long-term orangutan health research
project being conducted in the world at this time. This
is partly due to the complexity of self-medicating be-
haviours of the orangutan and the astonishing variety
of ora in the rainforest, as well as geographical and
seasonal variations.
The primary focus of this research investigates how wild
orangutans combat parasitic infections by the use of
specic rainforest plant species. Main topics of research
are:
1. Anti-parasitic properties of extracts isolated from In-
donesian plants and their eect on selected parasitoses.
to develop comparable in vitro and in vivo systems suit-
able for studies on selected parasites
to test selected compounds for antiparasitic activity by
means of applications of selected biological active com-
pounds to both in vitro and in vivo systems
2. Orangutan parasite infections, including the eects
of certain ecological factors
Possible eld work may include sampling and data col-
lection from several sites in Sumatra (Langkat and Aceh
Tengara) and Kalimantan (Sebangau and Mawas area).
The PhD program usually consists of four years of
coursework and supervised dissertation research. In
addition, the faculty encourages students to conduct
part of their dissertation research at partner institu-
tions in other countries or to participate in collabora-
tive research projects. All doctoral study programs at
the Faculty of Science are accredited in both Czech and
English languages; prospective students may thus apply
in either language.
Candidate Requirements
Candidates are expected to have strong backgrounds in
the elds of parasitology and animal population ecol-
ogy, as well as sucient English language skills (both
spoken and written) to fully understand the study ma-
terials. Applicants are required to hold a correspond-
ing master degree from a university, and be capable of
working both independently and as part of a team.
Furthermore, the following skills are advantageous:
o Experience with parasite culturing techniques
o Experience with coprological methods
o Experience with molecular methods of isolation and
PCR
o Experience with data analysis in community ecology,24 EvolDir November 1, 2012

InducedPlantDefenceEvolution
Department of Molecular Ecology in Max Plank Insti-
tute for Chemical Ecology is oering a PhD position on
molecular basis of induced plant defence evolution.
**
Plants have been threatened by insect herbivores for
more than 350 million years. During their struggle for
survival, plants have evolved many sophisticated anti-
herbivore defence strategies, ranging from physical bar-
riers to toxins and antifeedants. Because defence in
plants is costly, induced defence was suggested have
evolved as a means of reducing these costs. Induced
defence is widespread in plants and its importance has
been widely accepted by ecologists and biologists. How-
ever, how did induced defence evolve and what are the
molecular basis are remain unknown.
In this project, we will take a multiple disciplinary ap-
proach, which combines tools in plant metabolomics,
genomics, molecular biology, chemical ecology and
molecular evolution in a systematic framework to in-
vestigate the evolution of herbivore induced plant de-
fence and its molecular basis. The study system will be
/Nicotiana attenuata, /an ecological model plant, ini-
tiates growth in a post-re environment in response to
water-soluble chemical cues in wood smoke, and evolved
sophisticated herbivore induced defense strategies.
We are looking for a highly-motivated candidate with
a solid background in plant evolution and genomics.
Bioinformatics background and skills will be considered
as a plus. The PhD fellowship is funded for three years.
The position is available immediately and will remain
open until lled.

PHD POSITION: \DOMESTICATION AND THE
EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR"
The position is available in Animal behaviour at the
Department of Zoology, StockholmUniversity. Appli-
cation Deadline: 20 November 2012.
**
Project description: Domestication of animals involves
behavioural changes such as increased tolerance and
less aggressiveness. Such changes will inuence an an-
imal's social relationships. By studying domesticated
animals and their wild ancestors, we can increase our
knowledge of the evolution of social behaviour. Studies
of wolves and feral dogs show dierences in both the
intensity of territorial defense and the degree of aggres-
siveness within a pack, but the knowledge of how so-
cial behaviour and aggression develop during ontogeny
is small. This project aims to increase our knowledge
of the eects of domestication by studying two related
species, a non-domesticated species (the wolf) and a
domesticated species (the dog), primarily in relation
to the ontogeny of variables relevant to social life and
especially social dominance. Social behaviours during
ontogeny will be studied during the juvenile period, in-
cluding behavioural tests at dierent ages and physi-
ological parameters. The project can provide impor-
tant insights into how evolutionary changes in social
behaviour can occur.
Qualications: MSc or similar degree in animal be-
haviour or related disciplines, including at least 80
weeks (120 Swedish higher education credits) of biol-ogy studies, with a degree project in animal behaviour
of at least 20 weeks (30 creditsat advanced level. Ap-
plicants who have acquired corresponding competence
in Swedenor abroad are also qualied. Applicants will
be assessed based on their documented knowledge in
elds relevant to the research area, their creativity, in-
dependence and social competence, the quality of their
degree project thesis and other publications, and the
cover letter. Applicants with documented experience
of behavioral studies will have an advantage in the se-
lection process.
The position corresponds to four years fulltime work.
A scholarship is available for the rst year and a PhD
employment for the following three years.
The application should include a one-page presentation
(cover letter) of yourself and why you want to undertake
a PhD within this project. The application should also
include your CV, a copy of the thesis of your degree
project, a copy of your diploma or degree certicate,

Project description: The project will investigate the en-
vironmental factors driving variation in phenotypic se-
lection on timing of reproduction in iteroparous plants
via interactions with antagonistic and mutualistic an-
imals. An important part of the project is to assess
the eects of interactions on lifetime tness using de-
mographic information, and to calculate estimates of
selection based on lifetime tness. The project will also
use long-term data sets to estimate individual-specic30 EvolDir November 1, 2012
reaction norms between timing of reproduction and cli-
mate as well as selection on these reaction norms.
The project will initially focus on a model system
consisting of a perennial plant (Lathyrus vernus),
its' antagonists (large mammalian herbivores and pre-
dispersal seed predators) and mutualists (bumble-bee
pollinators). The methods will consist of experiments
in the eld, common garden and greenhouse as well
as correlational eld studies. The analytical frame-
work will consist of phenotypic selection analyses to
link traits with tness components and demographic
analyses, such as integral projection models (IPMs), to
link tness components with lifetime tness.
Qualications: MSc or similar degree in ecology or re-
lated disciplines (at least 4 years education including
a minimum of 10 weeks ecology courses). We seek a
candidate with good knowledge of ecological and evo-
lutionary theory, analytical capacity and good skills in
English. Previous experience of eld and or experimen-
tal work is desirable.
How to apply: Application should include (1) a let-
ter stating why the applicant should be considered a
strong candidate for the position, (2) a CV, (3) one copy
of the master thesis (and other documents supporting
your competence and suitability for the position), (4)

SyracuseU PlantEvolution
Msc and PhD positions in Plant Evolutionary Biology
beginning September 2013 are available in the Biology
Department at Syracuse University. Our lab is using
a combination of ecological and genomics approaches
to address questions related to the evolution of repro-ductive transitions in plants. Our work focuses on
understanding the enormous diversity in plant repro-
ductive strategies by combining approaches in evolu-
tionary ecology, population and ecological genetics and
genomics. We are particularly interested in the role
of adaptation and natural selection in driving repro-
ductive transitions like changes in pollination systems
(e.g. animal to wind), mating strategies (e.g. out-
crossing to selng, hermaphroditism to dioecy) and life-
history transitions (e.g. perennial to annual). We use
a variety of study systems to address these questions,
including the seep monkeyower (Mimulus guttatus),
ragweed, meadow-rues, and sedges, and combine eld
work, greenhouse and growth chamber studies with ge-
netic and genomic analyses.
We are looking for highly motivated graduate stu-
dents, with a strong background in evolution and ecol-
ogy. International students with high academic achieve-
ments will be considered. Syracuse University Biol-
ogy has a strong and growing research faculty (http:/-
/biology.syr.edu/faculty/faculty.htm), as well as a di-
verse and interactive group of people interested in plant
ecology and evolution (http://plantecology.syr.edu/).
In addition, we share a campus with SUNY-College of
Environmental Science and Forestry, providing lots of
opportunity for interaction.
We oer a competitive and generous stipend as well
as free tuition and excellent health insurance. We are
located in a brand new state-of-the-art building with
excellent facilities.

*MSc position - ecology and evolution of host-parasite
associations. * A graduate research position is avail-
able in Dr. Lien Luong's research group ( http:/-
/www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/lien luong/) at the
University of Alberta. Students interested in the ecol-
ogy and evolution of infectious diseases and/or parasite-
host interactions are encouraged to apply.
Pathogenic organisms that are harmless under certain
conditions can suddenly become extremely harmful un-
der dierent circumstances. Indeed levels of parasitism
vary continuously in nature, with some species shift-
ing along a continuum from benign to pathogenic over
ecological and evolutionary time. But even more fun-
damental to this issue is the process by which para-
sitism *per se* evolved. One of our goals is to in-
vestigate the life-history evolution of parasites that ex-
press variation in host exploitation strategies, and iden-
tify the selection pressures that lead to the transition
to a parasitic lifestyle. Facultative parasites present
a unique and interesting opportunity for addressing
these questions because they regularly shift from free-
living to parasitic lifestyles. The facultative ectopar-
asitic mite, *Macrocheles subbadius* feeds and repro-
duces on highly ephemeral habitats. However, mites
become parasitic under certain circumstances by at-
taching to and feeding on *Drosophila *fruit y hosts.
The student will be involved in laboratory manipula-
tion of ecological conditions to identify the factors that
favour the transition to increased infectivity.

UBerne 2 GenomicDiversity
2 PhD positions: Eect of range expansions on func-
tional genomic diversity
Two PhD positions will be available for 3 years at the
University of Berne to investigate the eect of range ex-
pansions on non-neutral genomic diversity. Theoretical
and simulation results suggest that spatially expanding
populations should accumulate non-neutral mutations
at a higher rate than stationary populations through
the mechanism of gene surng. The present research
project aims at verifying these predictions in bacterias
and in humans.
The rst PhD student will perform and analyse the out-
put of a series of experiments with bacterias, measure
their tness at various stages of their expansions and
analyse the evolution of their genome by NGS. These34 EvolDir November 1, 2012
analyses will be done in collaboration with Prof. Mar-
tin Ackermann in ETH Zurich. The candidate is ex-
pected to have a good background in microbiology and
a strong interest in evolution and population genomics.
The second PhD student will be involved in the
analysis of full exomes of human individuals from
a region of Qu ebec known to have been recently
colonized and where gene surng has been evi-
denced (see http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/-
6059/1148.abstract). He/she should be also involved in
the modeling and simulation of genomic regions under
selection, and thus have a good background in popula-
tion genomics or bioinformatics, and in statistics. Pro-
gramming abilities (e.g. R, C++) will be a plus for this
position.
The successful candidates will be able to further their
education by following courses organized by Swiss inter-
University doctoral programs in Population Genomics
and Bioinformatics. Their salaries will follow the Swiss
NSF scale. The CMPG lab oers a very stimulating
research environment with access to a fully equipped
wet lab, high performance computation facilities and
it is aliated to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.
Berne is ideally located in the middle of Switzerland
and Europe, and provides rich cultural and outdoor ac-
tivities.
Please send before November 1 2012, an applica-
tion letter stating your motivation for one position, a

PhD position - University of Bielefeld - Social inuencesduring adolescence on adult behaviour in zebra nches:
endocrine mechanisms and functional consequences.
A three-year PhD position is available at the Depart-
ment of Animal Behaviour, University of Bielefeld,
for work on a project combining behavioural and en-
docrinological approaches to study eects of social en-
vironment during adolescence on adult behavioural and
hormonal response to social challenges using the zebra
nch (Taeniopygia guttata) as a model species.
Phenotypic plasticity is caused by the interplay of en-
vironment and genetic background. Early environment
can predict future conditions which enables the organ-
ism exibly to adjust its development accordingly. In a
variety of species, social inuences during adolescence
can modify adult behaviour, physiology and morphol-
ogy. However, we still know very little about the (hor-
monal) mechanisms and function of these eects. This
project will look at hormonal proles and behaviour of
individuals experiencing dierent social environments
during adolescence. We use hormonal manipulations
to study their role in behaviour and the endocrine sys-
tem in adult life. Finally, we will study the functional
consequences of adult social behaviour by assessing t-
ness costs and benets in dierent social settings during
adulthood.
I am seeking a highly motivated and independent stu-
dent who is interested in the hormonal mechanisms, de-
velopment and function of social behaviour. The PhD
project will require skills in the handling of birds and
behavioural observations, invasive techniques (blood
sampling, hormonal implants) and lab work, all of
which may involve regular attendance during weekends.
The applicant ideally has experience with animal ex-
perimentation and observation as well as with lab tech-
niques relating to the above. Excellent communication
skills in English as well as experience in statistical anal-
yses and scientic writing are a denite advantage. An
MSc (or equivalent) in Biology is required.
My young and dynamic research group (http://-
www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/vhf/NE/) is part of the
Department of Animal Behaviour. We oer a stimu-
lating international environment with research groups
focusing on function, mechanisms and evolution of be-
haviour, using a variety of model systems in the lab and
the eld. We have excellent research infrastructure and
supporting sta and the working language is English.
The project is funded by the German Research Foun-
dation (DFG) and embedded in a larger research unit
with several PhD projects at the University of Bielefeld
and M unster studying the \Reduction of phenotypic
plasticity in behaviour by early experience: functionalNovember 1, 2012 EvolDir 35
consequences of an adaptive mechanism" (http://-
www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/biologie/fg1232/). The suc-
cessful candidate will therefore benet from additional
scientic meetings, master classes and method work-
shops.
The PhD salary is set according to the regulations of
public service in Germany (TV-L E13, 65%). The con-
tract is for three years and shall start at the earliest in
February 2013.
If you are interested, please send your application with

Social inuences on quail behaviour and physiology over

PhD position - University of Bielefeld
Project title: Evolution of transgenerational eects:
function and genetics of epigenetics
A three-year PhD position is available at the Depart-
ment of Animal Behaviour, University of Bielefeld, for
work on a project combining behaviour, endocrinol-
ogy and genetics to better understand the evolution of
transgenerational eects.
Phenotypic variation is determined to a large extent
not only by the underlying genetic architecture, but
also by epigenetic eects causing variation in gene ex-
pression. Variation in ospring phenotypes induced by
hormone-mediated maternal eects are especially inter-
esting since steroid hormones act as transcription fac-
tors, thereby directly aecting the epigenome. Thiscan lead to heritable modications across generations.
However, the adaptive and evolutionary signicance of
transgenerational epigenetic eects is highly debated.
In this study we will investigate not only whether pre-
natal maternal eects prepare ospring in an optimal
way for the future environment, but we will also analyse
the underlying hormonal mechanisms and the heritabil-
ity of these. We will breed Japanese Quail (Coturnix
coturnix japonica) under dierent social settings and
follow the progeny across several generations. By com-
bining behavioural, endocrinological and gene expres-
sion measurements, we aim at enhancing our knowledge
on the mechanisms and function of prenatal maternal
eects.
We are seeking a highly motivated student who is fas-
cinated by mechanisms underlying phenotypic plastic-
ity and wants to embark on a long-term study. The
main focus of the PhD project will be the behavioural
aspects of this study, however, the candidate will be
highly involved in both the endocrinological and ge-
netic aspects as well. The work will include both han-
dling and behavioural observations of captive quail as
well as laboratory work to analyse tissue/blood samples
for endocrinological and epigenetic data. Consequently
the ideal applicant will have experience with animal
experiments and lab techniques relating to the above.
Excellent communication skills in English as well as ex-
perience in statistical analyses and scientic writing are
a denite advantage. An MSc (or equivalent) in Biology
is required.
Our young and dynamic research group is part of
the Department of Animal Behaviour (http://www.uni-

PhD Scholarship Phylogeography, Extinctions and
Global Climate Change
Applications are invited for a PhD scholarship at the
Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, De-
partment of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Den-
mark. The PhD candidate will be enrolled for a 3 year
period starting between January 1 and March 1, 2013.
Research area and project description: This PhD
project is part of a new Sapere Aude grant enti-
tled \Species Extinctions Under Climate Change: Re-
evaluating Extinction Risk" (EXTINCTIONs). EX-
TINCTIONs aims at assessing past and current popu-
lation dynamics and extinction processes and how can
this knowledge about the past help to better predict the
future impacts of global change in biological diversity.
A signicant aspect of the EXTINCTIONs will in-
volve relating Species Distribution Models, SDMs,
and paleoclimate simulations to population ge-
netic/phylogeographic data to investigate the relation-
ship between population size and geographic range size
under climate change over evolutionary time-scales.
The PhD student will contribute to this broader ob-jective by investigating the spatial and temporal dy-
namics of genetic diversity and population structure
for numerous species during the Late Quaternary. The
goal of this PhD project will be to integrate phylo-
geographic inference with methods and theory from
other ecological and evolutionary sub-disciplines (in-
cluding macroecology) to understand population dy-
namics under historical climate change. Technically,
the project will include conducting statistical phylogeo-
graphic and population genetic analyses, species distri-
bution modeling, and GIS manipulation of species dis-
tribution and climatic data. To achieve this aim the
Phd student will help, in collaboration with a bioin-
formatician, to compile a database of phylogeographic
and population genetic data spanning dierent biomes
and taxonomic groups from public databases such as
GENBANK, NCBI and EMBL.

vated graduate students for Fall 2013. We seek stu-
dents who are broadly interested in fungal ecology, evo-

of the Pecan True (Tuber lyonii). Tuber lyonii is a
common, edible true that forms symbiotic ectomycor-
rhizal associations with Carya illinoinensis (Pecan) and
other angiosperms throughout the Southeastern USA.
This commercially valuable species can fetch prices of
$10-20 an ounce but up until now the biology of this
species has been mostly unknown. For example: What
is the population structure of Tuber lyonii? How does
it disperse into pecan orchards? What soil and man-

govern competition with other ectomycorrhizal fungi?
These are some of the many questions that the Pecan
True project is trying to answer. If you are passionate
about fungi and/or ecology and would like to dig deep
into true biology, please apply for this position. For

UIllinois AquaticFungiGenetics
The Dalling and Heath labs at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign seek applicants for a
graduate research position through either the Pro-
gram in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation (http:/-
/sib.illinois.edu/peec/) or the Department of Plant
Biology grad program (http://www.life.illinois.edu/-
plantbio/graduateAdmissions.htm). Students inter-
ested in ecology, genetics, and evolution of micro-
bial communities are encouraged to apply! In a
new project entitled, \Community assembly and de-
composer function of aquatic fungi along a salin-
ity gradient", which was recently funded by the Na-
tional Science Foundation, we will study the pro-
cesses that determine the assembly of wood decom-
poser communities in freshwater-estuarine river sys-
tems in Coiba Island National Park on the Pacic
coast of Panama. This project will provide unique,
cross-disciplinary training in tropical ecology, metage-
nomics, bioinformatics, microbiology, and fungal taxon-
omy. Students will also have the opportunity to apply
to a recently-funded NSF IGERT (graduate training
grant: http://sib.illinois.edu/igert/index.php), which
is focused on integrating genomic data with organ-
ismal biology. Interested applicants should contactone of the PIs: Astrid Ferrer (aferrer@life.illinois.edu),

UIllinois FishEvolution
Two graduate research positions are available in
the laboratory of Dr. Becky Fuller (http://-
www.life.illinois.edu/fuller/) at the University of Illi-
nois. Students interested in evolution and ecology of
shes are encouraged to apply.
Our lab has two main research themes. The rst re-
search theme focuses on the evolution of color pattern
and color vision and how this varies with environmen-
tal conditions. This line of research includes questions
about (a) the origins of female mating preferences, (b)
the maintenance of genetic variation in male color pat-
terns within populations, (c) the signicance of popula-
tion dierentiation in phenotypic plasticity in color pat-
tern, visual traits, and mating traits, and (d) the scale
of temporal and spatial variation in lighting conditions
and its eects on color pattern and color vision. Our
most recent work involves developing models of visual
detectability to determine how dierent species perceive
color patterns in dierent environments. Our second
research theme focuses on speciation and the extent to
which it is driven by natural selection to dierent envi-
ronmental conditions. This includes questions about
(a) whether reinforcement or adaptation to dierent
abiotic conditions (namely salinity) is important for
the evolution of behavioral isolation, (b) whether post-
zygotic isolation evolves more rapidly for taxa that in-
habit radically dierent environments, and (c) whether
genomic rearrangements contribute to the evolution of
reproductive isolation. Our most recent work here in-
volves measuring QTL for reproductive isolation and
examining genomic divergence between freshwater and
saltwater populations/species of killish. Students with
interest/experience in genomics are welcome to apply.
Students in the Fuller lab have worked on a variety of
shes including killishes in the genus Lucania, top-
minnows, and darters. Students are welcome to de-
velop their own research projects independent of the
main lab projects, but students may also collaborate
on aspects of the main lab projects that are of in-
terest to them. Students may apply either through
the Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conserva-42 EvolDir November 1, 2012
tion Biology (http://sib.illinois.edu/peec/index.html)
or through the Department of Animal Biology (http:/-
/www.life.illinois.edu/animalbiology/). Students with
interests in genomics may be eligible for funding via a
recently awarded IGERT that emphasizes the vertical
integration from genomes to individuals to species and
ecosystems (http://sib.illinois.edu/igert/apply.html).
PhD candidates are preferred but students interested in
pursuing an MS degree are welcome to apply. If you are
interested in applying for a graduate position in my lab,
please send a letter of interest to fuller@life.uiuc.edu
describing your research interests, career goals and ra-

EvolutionCooperativeBehaviour
One available phd position: Partner Control/ Game
theory /Cooperation/Social Network
A 3 year phd position is available, for theoretical re-
search in a joint project of the Institute of Biology
at the University of Neuch^ atel and the Department of
Ecology and Evolution of the University of Lausanne,
the latter providing the actual working location (http:/-
/www.unil.ch/dee). It is funded by a project of the
Swiss National Science Foundation aiming at investi-
gating the evolution of various partner control mecha-
nisms in the context of cooperative interactions.
The project will be supervised by Redouan Bshary (an
empirical biologist at Neuch^ atel) and Laurent Lehmann
(a theoretical biologist at Lausanne) and aims at study-
ing a number of questions from a theoretical point of
view. How should an individual respond to a non-
cooperative partner? Should the partner be punished or
should one switch partner? How does partner switching
depend on the variation of the expressions of coopera-
tion in the population? Does it depend on the within-
group network of interactions? A key aspect of the
modeling will be that assumptions regarding popula-
tion structure and interaction patterns will be informed
by natural model systems such as vervet monkeys and
cleaner sh mutualism.Applicants should have a master degree in a relevant
area (e.g. behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology,
economics with focus on game theory, physics, or math-
ematics), with strong mathematical and computing
skills, and a vivid interest in fundamental research.
Inquiries and applications should be sent to lau-
rent.lehmann@unil.ch or redouan.bshary@unine.ch.
Applications should be sent by November 1st, and
should include a CV, a one-page statement of research
interests, and names of 2-3 referees. Only applications
with all these information will be considered.

SexChromosomeEvolution
A PhD position is available at the Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolution, University of Lausanne, to do mod-
eling work on the evolution of sex chromosomes.
Classical models (e.g. Ohno 1967) account for the pro-
gressive degeneration of sex chromosomes from an an-
cestral autosomal pair, over long evolutionary times (as
documented e.g. in mammals). However, the view is
now emerging that sex determination systems are often
much more dynamic and labile. In many groups, sex
chromosomes show no decay, due to a combination of
high turnover rate and occasional X-Y recombination.
The ultimate causes and evolutionary consequences
of such lability remain poorly understood. Using
individual-based simulations, we are investigating how
the interplay between sex-determination genes, sexually
antagonistic genes, recombination modiers and dele-
terious mutation load aect sex-chromosome evolution
(see relevant papers below). The project will be super-
vised by Nicolas Perrin in collaboration with Jerome
Goudet and Samuel Neuenschwander. The ideal can-
didate should have a solid background in evolutionary
biology and population genetics, interest in theory, and
good modeling skills. English is compulsory, French is
helpful for social life.
Application: send by e-mail a CV, motivation letter,
and names of three referees to Nicolas.Perrin@unil.ch
before November 10, 2012.
Starting date to be discussed depending on the sit-
uation of the candidate chosen. The Department of
Ecology and Evolution provides a very stimulating re-
search environment, with an active program of seminarsNovember 1, 2012 EvolDir 43

EvolutionSexualImprinting
4-year PhD studentship available at the University of
Manchester
Would you like to be part of a multi-disciplinary project
bringing together the elds of ecology, evolution, com-
puter science and control theory?
Title: The evolution of sexual imprinting behaviour
Anticipated start date: September of 2013.
Closing date for applications: December 7th, 2012.
Description: Why do individuals choose the mates they
choose? In many species, including humans, mate
choice depends in part on sexual imprinting. Sexualimprinting is a process by which individuals learn pref-
erences for mates with certain phenotypes by observing
other members of their populations. Dierent popula-
tions, and dierent sexes within populations, exhibit
dierent sexual imprinting strategies. Sexual imprint-
ing is an important component of animal behaviour,
and it helps to shape how phenotypes evolve and if
and when speciation occurs. However, how sexual im-
printing itself evolves, and why strategies dier between
populations and sexes, remains poorly understood.
The goal of this project is to develop a synthetic theory
for the evolution of sexual imprinting. With guidance
from Drs. Tucker Gilman and Eva Navarro-L opez at
the University of Manchester, the student who under-
takes this project will develop analytical models and
agent-based computational simulations to understand
when sexual imprinting should evolve and what im-
printing strategies we should expect to see in nature.
Research will consider how evolved imprinting strate-
gies can aect trait evolution in environments in which
selective pressures are heterogeneous in space and time.
In the third year of the studentship, the student will
spend six months in the lab of Prof. Erik Svensson at
Lund University, where he or she will gain experience
with experimental approaches to the study of sexual
imprinting, as well as professional experience working
with international collaborators.
Training will include classical methods in biology (e.g.,
population genetics, adaptive dynamics) and hybrid
systems modelling - a nascent area of research that
merges computer science, control engineering and dy-
namical systems analysis. The student will gain em-
pirical experience and professional experience with in-
ternational collaborators in the lab of Erik Svensson at
Lund University.
Candidates should: - be interested in using mathemati-
cal models to understand evolutionary processes; - have
a background in biology, or a willingness to acquire
such a background; - have a sound mathematical back-
ground; - have good verbal and written communication
skills, good interpersonal skills, and a collaborative at-
titude.
The ideal candidate will also: - have experience with
dynamical systems analysis; - have experience with
mathematical models, and with mathematical and com-
putational tools required to carry out the project; - have
experience in programming;
Applicants with multi-disciplinary backgrounds are es-
pecially welcome.
Funding available and eligibility: The studentship pro-
vides tuition fees and a stipend ( $13,590 per year, tax44 EvolDir November 1, 2012
free) to cover living expenses for 4 years for eligible UK
students. Students from the EU but outside the UK
are eligible for tuition and fees, but a stipend cannot
be guaranteed to non-UK students. A small amount of
travel funding is attached to the studentship. Students
from outside the EU will be considered, but must have
their own funding source.

UNeuchatel HostParasiteEvolution
A 3-year PhD position, funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation for research on the evolutionary
ecology of host-parasite interactions is available in the
group of Jacob Koella at the University of Neuch^ atel
from February 1, 2013 (with some exibility).
The general goal of my group is to integrate evolution-November 1, 2012 EvolDir 45
ary and ecological thinking into the epidemiology and
control of infectious diseases. We develop the theoret-
ical basis of this integration and test empirically as-
sumptions and predictions of the theory, using malaria,
microsporidians and their mosquito hosts as experimen-
tal systems.
The PhD-project will integrate resource ecology with
the within-host dynamics of parasite to obtain a better
picture of the evolution of the host-parasite interaction.
This approach explicitly takes into account a funda-
mental, yet largely neglected, aspect of parasites: that
they steal resources from their host to support their
own development. Resource ecology thus gives a mech-
anistic basis of the host's and the parasite's develop-
ment, and thereby brings theory in closer contact with
experimental observations, leading to a more realistic
description of the host-parasite interaction. The ex-
perimental system will be the microsporidian *Vavraia
culicis* and its host, the mosquito *Aedes aegypti*.
The PhD student will collaborate with a post-doc hired
on the same grant to integrate the theoretical and ex-
perimental approaches of the project. The specic work
can be purely experimental, purely theoretical, or a
mixture of the two; the balance depends on the PhD
student's interests.
The position requires an independent, enthusiastic, and
scientically curious person with a strong background
in evolutionary biology and an interest in parasitology.
Good knowledge of evolutionary theory is an advan-
tage, but not a prerequisite. An MSc (or equivalent) in
Biology is required. The positions require some teach-
ing of undergraduate and graduate biology labs. The
generous salary is in accordance with the standards of
the Swiss National Science Foundation.
Neuch^ atel is located in the French part of Switzerland
and is an attractive city with a high quality of life. The
city is located on the shore of Lake Neuch^ atel with the
Jura Mountains to the North and a view of the Bernese
Alps to the South. For outdoors enthusiasts, this is
an excellent area for outdoor activities such as hiking,
climbing or skiing.
Formal applications should include: a 1-2 page cover
letter (in English) indicating research interests, your
CV, and two letters of reference. Application dead-
line is November 18, 2012. Applications and in-

UZurich ConservationGenomics
Two PhD positions in conservation genomics
Two three-year Ph.D. studentships are available in the
laboratories of Lukas Keller and Andreas Wagner at the
University of Zurich to study conservation genomics of
Alpine ibex.
Evolutionary adaptation is essential for endangered
species to survive in the long term, yet the role of
functionally important genetic variation in the small,
isolated populations typical for endangered species is
only poorly known. These two PhD theses will ad-
dress this gap by studying the conservation genomics
of the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), a species that has ex-
perienced recent and severe bottlenecks. Using modern
population genomics techniques in more than a dozen
ibex populations, the successful candidates will study
functionally relevant genetic variation and relate it to
the dynamics of these populations.
The successful candidates are independent, creative,
interactive and highly motivated researchers, with a
strong background and interest in evolutionary biology.
These projects require the students to immerse them-
selves into both conservation and genomics. Thus, a
background in one, and a willingness to learn the other
is essential. Experience with a major programming or
scripting language is a bonus, because computational
data analysis that requires programming will be a ma-
jor part of the research work. Some eldwork may take
place in rough terrain high up in the mountains.
These PhD projects are part of the University of
Zurich's Research Priority Pro-gram ^ aEvolution in Ac-
tion' and will be jointly supervised by Lukas Keller
(conservation genetics) and Andreas Wagner (bioinfor-
matics) of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and
Environmental Studies. The Wagner lab at the Uni-
versity of Zurich uses next-generation sequencing and
functional genomics approaches, together with labora-
tory evolution experiments, to study the dynamics of
genetic change in evolving populations. More gener-
ally, the lab has extensive experience with bioinformat-
ics analyses of whole genome sequences ranging from
plants to humans. The Keller lab studies evolutionary
processes relevant for the long-term survival of endan-
gered species, and has extensively worked on Alpine
ibex. The working language in both laboratories is En-glish.
Zurich consistently ranks amongst the cities with the
highest quality of life. While it oers all the pleasures
of living in a bigger city, thanks to its central location
and excellent public transport system, it is extremely
easy to get out of the city and head for the mountains.
Applicants should have an MSc (or equivalent) in a
relevant eld. To be considered, please send a sin-
gle (!) PDF le merged from the following parts to
nicole.zweifel@ieu.uzh.ch: 1) a statement of research
interests not exceeding two pages, 2) a 1-page sum-
mary of your MSc work, 3) a detailed CV including
publication list (if available), 4) a scanned academic
transcript (list of grades in university courses), and 5)
the contact details of three references. Please include
the word \IBEX" in the subject line. Review of appli-

family formation in Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaus-
tus). This bird species is well investigated and earlier
studies focused on the role of parental investment for
family living (Ekman & Griesser 2002, Griesser et al
2006, Griesser 2008).
We will use a combination of eld experiments, long-
term data and physiological analyses (e.g. testosterone
& corticosteroid levels) to investigate the proximate fac-
tors that drive within brood competition and dispersal,
as well as cooperation among group members. The can-48 EvolDir November 1, 2012

UZurich OrangutanEvolution
PhD position ^Aat University of Zurich
Identifying cultural units in orangutans
The goal of this project is to identify which factors limitthe spread of behavioral innovations, since orangutans
lack well-dened bisexual social units as found in the
majority of primates. Orangutan females form clear
clusters of female relatives, but also have contacts with
others, especially males. The task is therefore to de-
scribe behavioral proles of many individuals at a site,
including multiple clusters, and relate dyadic similari-
ties to patterns in genetic relatedness, current associa-
tion frequency (social exposure) and home range over-
lap (environmental overlap). Observations will focus on
one Bornean and one Sumatran population that vary
in associations and cluster size. The project requires a
eld phase, including living under basic conditions, for
a total of ca. two years. The PhD candidate will be
a member of an international team and is expected to
take responsibility for research management and orga-
nizational tasks in the respective eld sites.
Suitable candidates should hold a master level degree
in biology (e.g. zoology, physical/evolutionary anthro-
pology). ^A In addition, they must have experience doing
eldwork in the tropics (at least 3 months), ^Abe well-
organized and able to work independently, be uent in
English, and willing to learn Indonesian. This PhD po-
sition is funded by the Anthropological Institute and
Museum of the University of Zurich (Switzerland). Ap-
pointment is subject to yearly renewal for a maximum
of 4 years. For further information contact Prof. Carel
van Schaik (vschaik@aim.uzh.ch) or Dr. Maria van No-
ordwijk.
Candidates should send a letter of application, curricu-
lum vitae, transcript of study records, contact infor-
mation for two academic referees, list of publications
if any, and a half-page summary of the Master's thesis
(all combined to a single PDF) to Maria van Noordwijk
(vnoord@aim.uzh.ch) no later than December 1, 2012.
Start of the project is planned for March 2013. ^A^A

UppsalaU 2 SpeciationGenomics
Speciation genomics
2 PhD positions at the Evolutionary Biology Centre of
Uppsala University, supervised by Prof Hans Ellegren
(see end of message for web page)November 1, 2012 EvolDir 49
Advances in large-scale genomics open new opportuni-
ties in speciation research. It allows us to address ques-
tions such as the genes underlying the process of speci-
ation, the character of genomic divergence during spe-
ciation, and speciation-with-gene-ow. Flycatchers of
the genus Ficedula oer an excellent model system for
studies of these and related questions (see e.g. Nature
387:589-592, 411:45-50, Science 318:95-97). We have re-
cently sequenced and de novo assembled the ycatcher
genome (at 85x coverage and with a scaold N50 of
7.3 Mb) and performed genome-wide re-sequencing of
multiple individuals (each at 5x coverage) of the two
closely related species collared ycatcher and pied y-
catcher (Nature, in press; doi:10.1038/nature11584).
By this we have identied a number of 'divergence is-
lands', many of which are associated with centromeres
and telomeres, potentially indicating a role for meiotic
drive in species divergence. We are now seeking new
PhD students to joi n this project in which coming re-
search will use data from whole-genome re-sequencing
of multiple populations (sympatric as well as allopatric)
and species, from a 50K SNP array (genotyping in pedi-
grees and population samples) and from the ycatcher
transcriptome and methylome. Genomic parameters
that will be analyzed include, for example, recombi-
nation rates, linkage disequilibrium, expression diver-
gence, and epigenetic modication. The precise direc-
tion of studies will be decided together with the suc-
cessful candidates.
The venue for these positions, the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre, is situated in recently-built localities in
central Uppsala. The working atmosphere is inter-
national with a regular recruitment of PhD students
and post-docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes
an exciting arena for multidisciplinary research in evo-
lutionary biology in a broad sense, housing some 300
scientists and graduate students, and with research
programs in, for example, ecology, genetics, genomics
and developmental biology. The scientic environ-
ment with numerous seminars, journal clubs and so-
cial activities oer excellent possibilities for contacts
and collaborations, and represents an ideal training for
students to become leading evolutionary biologists of
the future. A graduate school in 'The Genomics of
Phenotypic Diversity in Natural Populations' (http://-
www.ebc.uu.se/education/postgrad/gradschool/) pro-
vides a framework for courses and other activi-
ties for PhD students. Local platforms for next-
gen eration sequencing (http://www.scilifelab.uu.se)
and high-performance computational analyses (http:/-
/www.uppmax.uu.se) ensure immediate access to state-
of-the-art technology. Uppsala University is the oldest
university in Scandinavia and the city of Uppsala is avibrant student town with beautiful and easy accessible
surroundings conveniently situated close to Stockholm.
The positions, which are funded by a European Re-
search Council Advanced Investigator Grant, are ali-
ated with the Department of Evolutionary Biology - an
overview of the research activities in the environment
can be found at our web pages (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
Research/IEG/evbiol/). Thanks to a number of com-
petitive grants recently obtained, the environment has
expanded signicantly and houses 8 independent re-
search groups and about 20 PhD students, 20 post-
docs, and some bioinformaticians. A common theme
is that we address key questions in evolutionary biol-
ogy, like speciation, local adaptation, life history evo-
lution, genome and molecular evolution, using genomic
approaches. Study organisms include natural bird and
plant populations, Neurospora, Drosophila, zebra sh,
domestic animals and humans. We have tight connec-
tions with several other research programs at the Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre.
The fully-funded (salary, research and travel expenses)
PhD positions are for four years.
Applicants must hold a Master degree, or are to ob-
tain a degree this academic year, in evolutionary bi-
ology, genetics or bioinformatics, or in related disci-
plines. Successful candidates are expected to display
enthusiasm, curiosity, creativity and dedication to the
project. Informal inquiries and applications should be
sent by email to Hans.Ellegren@ebc.uu.se. Applicants
must provide a CV, a statement of research interests
and the name and contact details of at least two refer-
ences. The positions remain open until lled.

A PhD position is available to work on adaptive muta-
tions in C. elegans. Although benecial mutations have50 EvolDir November 1, 2012
been well-studied in prokaryotes, only limited informa-
tion is available for multicellular Eukaryotes. The PhD
student will use next generation sequencing to identify
novel, benecial mutations that occurred during an ex-
perimental evolution experiment. The trajectories of
these benecial mutations will be followed by a ne
scale temporal analysis. Modeling the spread of the
benecial mutations will be used to infer selection coef-
cients, dominance and epistasis. This project is a col-

The W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of Michi-
gan State University seeks to ll a tenure-track, aca-
demic year faculty position in microbial ecology. This
position is part of a University-wide Global Water Ini-
tiative to enhance and expand the capacity of MSU to
address fundamental and applied research questions re-
lated to the sustainable use of water. The position is
available beginning in Fall 2013 and can be lled at
either the Assistant or Associate Professor level.
Applicants should show evidence of their capacity to
develop externally funded and collaborative research
that uses microbes to address fundamental ecological
and evolutionary questions. KBS is ideally suited to a
eld-focused research program that links microbial pro-
cesses and population, community, ecosystem, and/or
landscape dynamics. While the specic research area
of interest is open, the individual selected for this po-
sition should have a demonstrated interest in research
involving aquatic systems.
The successful applicant will be expected to contributeto graduate research training at KBS and in their on-
campus department and participate in summer teach-
ing and research programs at KBS. Joint appointments
in the Departments of Microbiology and Molecular Ge-
netics, Zoology or Plant Biology, which would be the
tenure home for the successful applicant, will be evalu-
ated as part of the search process. The specic campus
teaching assignment for this position will depend on the
candidate's home department, but will be equivalent to
one course per year. They will also be expected to
participate in the interdepartmental graduate training
programs at MSU in Ecology, Evolution and Behav-
ioral Biology (EEBB) and/or Environmental Science
and Public Policy (ESPP). Opportunities for research
in collaboration with other KBS faculty and in Microbi-
ology and Molecular Genetics, Plant Biology, Zoology,
Geology and other departments involved in the estab-
lishment of the MSU Global Water Initiative will be
encouraged.
The position is based at KBS, an MSU o-campus re-
search facility that supports the research programs of
14 resident faculty, as well as campus-based and visit-
ing faculty from other institutions. KBS has state of
the art laboratory and eld research facilities and is lo-
cated approximately 65 miles from the main East Lans-
ing campus of MSU (www.kbs.msu.edu). The 3000+
acre land base of KBS and proximity to a diversity of
aquatic habitats provide ample opportunity for a eld-
based research program in microbial ecology. There is
a rich history in both microbial and aquatic ecology
research at KBS that provides a foundation for the re-
search to be developed by a new faculty member. KBS
also hosts an NSF Long-term Ecological Research site
that can provide opportunities for research collabora-
tion nationally.
Applications will be considered until the position is
lled. Review of applications will begin on 1 De-
cember 2012. Application materials should be sub-
mitted to MSU's online application website (https://-

This position is funded by the Danish Council for In-
dependent Research within a \Sapere Aude" grant en-
titled \Species Extinctions under Climate Change: Re-
evaluating Extinction Risk" (EXTINCTIONs). EX-
TINCTIONs aims at assessing past and current popu-
lation dynamics and extinction processes and how can
this knowledge about the past help to better predict the
future impacts of global change in biological diversity.
A signicant aspect of the project will involve relating
SDMs and paleoclimate simulations to population ge-
netic/phylogeographic data to investigate the relation-
ship between population size and geographic range size
over evolutionary time-scales.
We are seeking a dedicated bioinformatician to ll
a one-year support position for this project. The

building a phylogeographic dataset for a variety of dif-
ferent taxa (plants and animals) across dierent biomes.
The bioinformatician will also work together with a
PhD student and a post-doctoral researcher to imple-
ment population genetic and phylogeographic analyses,
and will provide support for other bioinformatic needs
as they arise.
The successful candidate will have a BSc or MsC (PhDsare also welcome to apply) in computer science and/or
molecular biology. Although the position is not a post-
doctoral position, we would be happy to consider candi-
dates with a PhD in population genetics who would be
interested in pursuing postdoctoral funding to continue
these research lines.
Applicants must have experience in gathering large
dataset from public DNA databases. The successful
applicant will be competent in the programming lan-
guages Perl, Java, Python, C or C++ and will be com-
fortable working in a UNIX environment. Experience
with bioinformatic tools like BIO++ or BIOPearl would
clearly be an advantage.

formatics and statistical phylogeographic analyses, in-
cluding likelihood-based or Bayesian coalescent mod-
elling (such as ABC and HABC models).
Good English communication and writing skills are es-
sential.
Place of Employment: The bioinformatician will be
employed by the University of Copenhagen and will
work at the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and
Climate (CMEC), a Center of Excellence directly
funded by the Danish National Research Foundation
and comprising 40 researchers from 16 dierent coun-

Answers:
1. Ian Dworkin (Michigan State University)
Cornelya,
I saw your post of EvolDir. I have a couple of sug-
gestions. My colleague Titus Brown and I have been
teaching a short course (2 week workshop) on the analy-
sis of next generation sequence data. We post all of thematerials online for free, including tutorials and some
lectures.
http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2011/ http:/-
/ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2012/ We use the
Amazon EC2 cloud computing system to run every-
thing (so students do not need any special computer).
While you normally have to pay, if you contact Amazon
they usually provide 100$ educational credit for EC2
for each student. In 2010 & 2011 we primarily used
unix shell scripting and python, while this past summer
Titus integrated a fair bit of the ipython notebook
framework (which I would not suggest unless you have
some familiarity with it. It is great for teaching, but
the teacher needs a fair bit of background).
I also highly recommend teaching the tutorials within
the context of very simple scripting/programming.
This could all be unix shell scripting or in a language
like python or R (or perl if that is what you know).
The problem with galaxy and other systems is that the
point and click model does not real provide any extra
added value (like the basics of programming), and since
the shelf life of such programs is not so long (3-4 years
usually), what is learned can become obsolete quickly.
I am not sure what background you have though, so it
clearly depends on this.
I am mostly involved with the more statistical side of
bioinformatics for expression data and genome map-
ping, but I can also make some suggestions for materials
if you like.
btw.. I am a Trent alum, graduated in 1997. I worked
really closely with Carolyn Kapron, Michael Berrill and
Jim Sutclie. If you see any of them, say hi for me ( I
saw them all 2 years ago at Michael's retirement party).
Cheers

Hi Cornelya,
I am teaching an introductory course in bioinformatics

ing material. I am attaching my slides and one lab for
the rst two topics in your list. For Galaxy I selected
a couple of tutorials available on the web starting with

me know if you have diculties or need more.
I have additional stu, on those and other subjects, but
the BTN ones have been checked and rated. Maybe
better to start at BTN. My materials are often inter-

Drosophila ananassae samples
Dear all,
I am looking to collect population samples of
Drosophila ananassae- ideally 100+ isofemale lines. I
am after either someone able to collect and send me
such lines, or any advice on good places to go and col-
lect ananassae to bring back to the UK.
We are interested in looking at the sigma virus in these
ies (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma viruses), so
existing lines that have been on CO2 are unfortunately
no use as infected lines will be killed.
Many thanks,

2013RubensteinFellows
*2013 EOL Rubenstein Fellows Program *
Over the past four years the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL,
http://eol.org) has grown to become one of the world's
largest aggregators of biodiversity information. Now
featuring information on over one million taxa, EOL
brings together trusted content from 219 scholarly con-
tent partners, including 57 current and former Ruben-
stein Fellows.
This year, EOL is inviting proposals supporting the use
of EOL in biological research - it is time to see whatthe wealth of information in EOL can do.
In preparation for this call, EOL solicited research top-
ics with the potential to illuminate large-scale questions
in biology and advance biological research. Eleven spe-
cic requests were selected by the EOL curator commu-
nity as the most promising, tractable, and potentially
impactful.
We are calling for proposals to extract data from
the EOL collection and advance the corresponding in-
quiry in one or several of these \Wishes for Research".
These \Big Data" questions have not previously been
tractable because the information needed to address
them was simply not accessible.
We believe it is now possible to begin to address these
questions with the help of EOL, and we are prepared
to fund your eorts to do so.
\How can I extract the data?" Any technique is ac-
ceptable.
\Crowdsourcing? Semantic reasoning? Automated im-
age analysis? Brute force?" Yes.
\I've thought of a method you haven't." Even better.
Please visit the 2013 EOL Rubenstein Fel-
lows competition page at http://eol.org/info/-

Wishes and the competition details. The competi-
tion deadline is November 15th. Questions can be
directed to the Rubenstein Fellows Coordinator at

Neotropical army ants samples
Request for Neotropical army ant samples (genus:
Eciton) for molecular and morphological work.
As a graduate student in Dr. Corrie Moreaus lab at
the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, IL,
USA, I plan to infer the Eciton phylogeny using RAD
sequencing to address questions of Amazonian speci-
ation for my dissertation. Sample contributions from
collaborator Dr. Daniel Kronauer at Rockefeller Uni-
versity have provided us with most of the species and
a large portion of the Eciton subspecies, but we are
still looking for additional samples to broaden our geo-
graphic coverage. Any Eciton samples you are able to
share would be helpful for our analysis, but there areNovember 1, 2012 EvolDir 91
two species that have remained elusive. In particular:
(1) Eciton setigaster (2) Eciton uncinatum
We will accept as many Eciton samples as you can
spare, but would prefer recent collections in 95-100%
EtOH. As many Eciton species have several recognized
subspecies that are often geographically distinct, full
collection information would be most appreciated. [we
would appreciate the additional data.] Additional in-
tact specimens would be helpful for the morphological
component of the study.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions
and please forward this request to anyone you know
that may be able to provide samples of army ants.
Please send all samples to:

Origin FixationDynamicsTheory
Dear evoldir{
About a year ago, we posted a query asking for help in
tracking down the source of models that characterize
evolutionary change as the product of a rate of mu-
tational origin and a probability of xation (e.g., k =
4Nus). We call them \origin-xation" models, but they
have no standard name that one can look up in an in-
dex, or search in a databaseX- thus the diculty of
tracking their history. Today, origin-xation models
represent an important branch of evolutionary genet-
ics, being widely used in hypothesis-testing in molecu-
lar evolution, in phylogenetics, and in models of adap-
tation.
We asked the evoldir community to share knowledge of
any sources prior to the 1969 work of King & Jukes[1], or Kimura & Maruyama [2]. We received a few re-
sponses, but nothing helpful. One person cited a source
that attributes k = 4Nus to Wright, 1949 [3], but this
turns out to be a red herring.
Subsequently, in preparing a literature review, we dis-
covered a 1938 paper by Wright [4] in which an inci-
dental result, noted by Wright, clearly reduces to k =
4Nus. By virtue of its other innovations, this paper has
been cited >100 times by theoreticians, but neither
Wright nor others cite it as a source of origin-xation
dynamics (determined by reading each of the 61 pre-
1985 publications that, to our knowledge, cite Wright's
1938 paper).
Thus, Wright (1938) seems to be the proverbial \excep-
tion that proves the rule" that origin-xation models
are an invention of the molecular era, and played no
meaningful role in the Modern Synthesis. We remain
interested in any evidence bearing on this point.

Phylogenies AmbiguousData
Dear Evoldir members,
I am seeking help or advice from anyone who has ex-
perience in constructing phylogenetic trees with nuclear
data that contains ambiguous positions (as consequence
of double peaks in the chromatogram). This has been
my procedure so far: First I have taken the nuclear
sequences as if these were haplotypes, but because of
the ambiguous positions, many nodes remain poorly re-92 EvolDir November 1, 2012
solved. Second, I reconstructed the possible alleles of
each nuclear sequence with PHASE and constructed the
phylogenetic trees with all these alleles. Third, I have
concatenated the two reconstructed alleles coming from
each sequence, and treated it as a single \haplotypic"
sequence; from here I constructed the pylogenetic trees.
I was wondering if anyone knows/thinks whether my
third approach is correct. On the contrary, if you think
there is a better way to address this issue I would really
appreciate some hints.
Thanks in advance,
Victoria

ProjectEvoMap
Hi,
I have decided this week to try to create a resource
where evolutionary biologists can nd info on labs and
groups from all around the world. I have created a col-
laborative Google map online which evolutionary biol-
ogy research groups can pin their labs to with a brief
description of their interests. Others can then browse
the map to look for labs in specic areas - for example,
if someone wants to nd suitable labs in their current
country for work they can see all the labs in that area,
likewise anyone looking for work in a specic region or
who needs access to labs while on eldwork can look
for nearby groups which may be able to help.
Yesterday ProjectEvoMap was born, spread using twit-
ter, already has labs from all over the world, and has
received plenty of positive feedback. Hopefully this
project will make networking easier, raise awareness of
smaller groups, and promote collaboration. So could I
ask you to take a moment to add your groups to it as
well because the more that add to it, the better it be-
comes. Ideally I'd like to get pins on the map for each
group, not just each department.
To add a lab follow this link (https:/-

Hi all,
I know you all emailed information to your mailing lists
about ProjectEvoMap last week, but there have been
changes to the set up so I would really appreciate it if
you could read and circulate this email.
Unfortunately some people were struggling with the
Google maps interface and this lead to pins being moved
or deleted accidentally. I have now changed editing op-
tions so only I can add pins & edit the map.
ProjectEvoMap is now viewable by visiting http:/-
/projectevomap.yolasite.com/ Or Google-ing Pro-
jectEvoMap Or on my twitter account @GrinEvo
(which you should also follow for updates)
To add a lab to the map you should email pro-
jectevomap@live.co.uk with the following 1. Univer-
sity/ Institute name 2. Group leaders name 3. Brief
research description 4. Address
Sorry for sending another email about this, but it is
now easier for you to add a map & is completely safe
from tampering V the changes only make more work
for me!
I hope you nd the time to join this exciting new project
which now has >130 labs covering every inhabited con-
tinent, and nearly 10,000 views in its rst 5 days! I am
delighted it has been such an active project and really

Software ExaML
LargePhylogeneticAnalyses
Dear Community,
A new parallel version of RAxML-Light, called ExaML
(Exascale ML) was released today.
It uses a new parallelization approach which dramat-
ically increases parallel eciency (up to a factor of 4
compared to RAxML-Light) on large partitioned phy-
logenomic datasets.
This is a dedicated program for distributed memory
clusters and supercomputers.
It only works with MPI!
The code and some initial documentation are available
here:
https://github.com/stamatak/ExaML User support
will be provided via the RAxML google group.
Cheers,

Software
NewMorphometricSoftware in R
Hello all,
We are happy to announce the release of GeoMorph: a
morphometrics package in R for the collection and anal-
ysis of landmark-based geometric morphometric data.
It is available on the CRAN package website.
Geomorph provides routines for all stages of a geo-
metric morphometric analysis. It allows one to read,
manipulate, and digitize 2D and 3D landmark data,
generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for
points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analysesof shape variation and covariation, and provide graphi-
cal depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation.
Most of geomorph's functions are designed for re-
searchers interested in testing ecological and evolu-
tionary hypotheses of shape variation and covariation.
Methods are available to:
Data -read existing landmark data les into R (nts, tps,
Morphologika format) -digitize 3D landmarks from sur-
face images within R -estimate missing landmarks on
specimens
Shape -Superimpose specimens using GPA (for both
landmarks and semilandmarks)
Analyses -Anova/regression designs -
integration/modularity analyses -analysis of phe-
notypic trajectories -assessment of phylogenetic signal
for shape data
Visualization -scatterplots of shapes -shape deforma-
tion plots -plots of allometric trajectories -plotting phy-
logenies in shape space
In the coming months we will add additional functions
of interest to evolutionary biologists.

Tucson Hackathon Jan28-Feb1
Phylogenies! Hacking! Tucson in January!
An implicit promise of the Tree of Life project is that,
ultimately, expert knowledge of species phylogeny will
be accessible and usable by everybody. In other words,
we will all be able to get the species trees we need, in
a useable form, when we need them. The Phylotastic
project aims to make that vision a reality, by develop-
ing a loosely coupled system of components that, in re-
sponse to a user's query (a list of taxa plus conditions),
will rectify names, nd suitable source trees, prune and
graft to get the right species, estimate branch lengths,
and return the results with metadata on sources and
methods.
In June 2012, the HIP (Hackathons, Interoperabil-94 EvolDir November 1, 2012
ity, Phylogenies) working group of NESCent staged
a hackathon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)
to prototype components of a Phylotastic system, and
implement demos to show their potential. Thanks to
25 participants who responded to an open call (just like
this one), that hackathon was an extraordinary success
(see http://phylotastic.org/).
Now we are gearing up for a second hackathon, to take
another step toward providing computable, convenient,
credible access to the Tree of Life. We aim to recruit
a diverse group of participants, including students, fac-
ulty, postdocs, and sta of both genders and from dif-
ferent backgrounds. Only some of the seats at the
hackathon will be lled by expert hackers who spend
their time coding. We also need folks who can:
* Provide knowledge of workows and downstream uses
of trees * Design user interfaces * Test software * Make
screencasts, develop tutorials, and document user ex-
periences
Applications are now being accepted to Phylotastic 2,
which will take place January 28th, 2013 to February
1st, 2013 at the BIO5 facility in warm and sunny Tuc-
son, AZ (http://bio5.arizona.edu/about-bio5). Infor-
mation on how to apply is provided below. Partial
support (and, if funds allow, full support) for travel,
food and lodging will be available to each successful
applicant who indicates need. We particularly welcome
applications from women and members of underrepre-

Volunteers SouthAfrica
SmallMammals
2 volunteers needed from November and 1 from Decem-
ber 2012 onwards
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of eld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood samples
are collected for physiological measurements. Volun-
teers are also expected to help with maintenance of the
research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1250 (around 180 US$, 120 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
2500, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$, 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in
Germany, SSJARP in Switzerland).
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
2 volunteers starting in November and 1 in December
2012. Volunteers are expected to stay at least three
months, but longer periods of up to 6months are pre-
ferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr.

Although this project is on pollutant impacts, evolu-
tionary ecological and ecosystem ecology concepts are
used to understand the responses from individuals to
population to ecosystems.
|{
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is a Swiss-based and internationally

The Department of Aquatic Ecology has a vacancy for
a three year position as
Postdoctoral Researcher on Impacts of pollutants on
aquatic ecosystems The contamination of freshwater
systems with micropollutants (MPs) is a key environ-
mental problem, but the basic principles of how MPs
impact aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood. The
specic goals of this project are therefore to test i)
whether MPs have ecosystem level consequences and
ii) how these eects are mediated across dierent hi-
erarchical levels in ecosystems (from individuals and
populations to communities and ecosystem function).
The postdoctoral project is embedded in a large col-
laborative and interdisciplinary eort that encompasses
research from environmental chemistry and ecotoxi-
cology to evolutionary ecology and ecosystem ecol-
ogy. The project is theory driven and involves innova-
tive experimental approaches combined with large scale
eld surveys and the use of up-to-date methodology
in measurements of ecosystem function and ecotoxicol-
ogy/chemistry.
A Ph.D. degree in biology or related area is mandatory.
The main selection criterion for this position is scientic
excellence. The ideal candidate has a strong concep-
tual basis in evolutionary ecology/ecosystem ecology100 EvolDir November 1, 2012
and their applications (especially environmental stress
research and/or environmental toxicology). Previous

INIA Madrid PopulationGenetics
The Population Genetics and Evolution (PGE) Group
at the INIA Forest Research Centre in Madrid, Spain,
would like to advertise a recent call for human resources
published by the Spanish Secretary of State for Re-
search, Development and Innovation. The call includes,
across science disciplines,
225 three-year contracts for postdocs with up to four
years post-doctoral experience in the \Juan de la
Cierva" subprogramme (PhD degree obtained not ear-lier than September 1st, 2008; application deadline Nov
27), and
175 ve-year contracts for researchers with up to ten
years postdoctoral experience in the \Ram on y Cajal"
subprogramme (PhD degree obtained not earlier than
January 1st, 2002; application deadline Nov 29).
We call for excellent and motivated young researchers
to apply for these contracts with our group. Appli-
cants with expertise in evolutionary ecology, bioinfor-
matics, next-generation sequencing, and/or statistical
genetics are especially encouraged. Juan de la Cierva
candidates should present a project in conjunction with
a host researcher. Candidates for the highly competi-
tive Ram on y Cajal subprogramme should develop their
own project/research line, which should extend the re-
search currently developed by the group. Successful
Ram on y Cajal candidates will receive 40,000 EUR in
research funds and are expected to apply for additional
funding in R+D+I calls.
The PGE group at INIA-CIFOR is composed of four
researchers (Santiago C. Gonz alez-Mart nez, Juan Jos e
Robledo Arnuncio, Ricardo Al a and Jos e Climent), two
\Ram on y Cajal" fellows (Delphine Grivet and Myr-
iam Heuertz), two postdocs, ve PhD students and two
technicians. Our expertise is in population and quan-
titative genetics, evolutionary ecology and population
dynamics of plants, mostly forest trees. Our main study
organisms are Mediterranean conifers and some tropical
trees. We examine the demographic, reproductive and
genetic processes that inuence adaptation to chang-
ing environments of forest species, including biogeo-
graphic approaches and applications for management
and conservation of forest genetic resources. We de-
velop studies on gene ow, local adaptation, plasticity
and phenotypic integration and on the molecular basis
of adaptation, as well as new statistical methods.

link expired prematurely)November 1, 2012 EvolDir 103
Three year post
Applications are invited to join the Department of In-
fectious Disease Epidemiology located at the St Mary's
campus, Paddington. The department is based within
a ve star research institute equipped with the lat-
est technologies and facilities. DIDE is arguably the
largest grouping of infectious disease epidemiologists
in the world with a very wide range of skills repre-
sented, from experimental studies on bacterial/fungal
pathogens, through population genetics and infectious
disease modelling to eld work on emerging infectious
disease. As such, the Department oers excellent re-
search facilities and a friendly, intellectually stimulat-
ing, working environment.
Emerging fungal infections are attracting increasing sci-
entic and policy interest as their impact on human and
ecosystem health becomes more pronounced (see Na-
ture 484 2012). This Research Associate post is funded
by a 3-year MRC project grant, entitled 'An evolution-
ary population genomics approach to determine the ge-
netic basis of virulence in the pathogenic fungus Cryp-
tococcus neoformans', and seeks to understand the evo-
lutionary basis underlying this pathogen's emergence as
a leading cause of human disease in Africa and South
East Asia.
The post holder will join a multidisciplinary team of
researchers that are using statistical genetic and func-
tional genomic approaches to identify the patterns and
processes that have led to contemporary distributions of
genetic diversity for emerging pathogenic fungi, with a
focus on Cryptococcus. The post-holder will have a key
role in study design and will develop a state-of-the-art
bioinformatics pipeline for assembling next-generation
sequence data from a global panel of environmental and
clinical Cryptococcus isolates. These data will be used
for statistical genetic, phylodynamic and evolutionary
analyses with the ultimate goal of dening the subset
of genetic diversity that is associated with virulence
and spatial-expansion of key lineages of Cryptococcus.
Key responsibilities will be to develop cutting-edge ap-
proaches to managing large eukaryote population ge-
nomics datasets, and to liaise with our international
collaborators in order to eectively share and curate
genome-data.
The successful candidate will have a strong bioinfor-
matic, evolutionary or statistical genetics background
with a PhD degree or equivalent in a relevant quanti-
tative subject.
This post is a full time and xed term until 31st July
2015.

tracellular biomineralization of calcium carbonates by
cyanobacteria
Postdoctorate position 2 or 3 years
Institute of Mineralogy and Physics of Condensed Mat-
ter (IMPMC), Paris
European Research Council Starting Grant
Cyanobacteria are among the most important bacte-
ria involved in the interactions between the geosphere
and the biosphere. They are photosynthetic bacteria
that appeared more than 2.3 billion years ago. It is
usually assumed that by xing CO2 in the form of or-
ganic carbon, they raise the pH of the environment
and induce precipitation of calcium carbonates. They
may thus have had a major role in the formation of
carbonate rocks throughout Earths history. Despite
the geochemical importance of cyanobacteria-mediated
CaCO3 biomineralization, the mechanistic details of
this process are yet poorly understood.
Very recently, we discovered the existence of an early-
diverging cyanobacterial species, Candidatus Gloeo-
margarita lithophora, which can form intracellular car-
bonates (Couradeau et al., 2012, Science). This chal-
lenges all existing models of cyanobacterial calcica-
tion which assumed that carbonate precipitation by
cyanobacteria was exclusively extracellular and was
thus not controlled by the cells. We know almost noth-
ing about the phylogenetic distribution of this capa-
bility to produce intracellular carbonates or about the
involved biological mechanisms. The study of molecu-
lar mechanisms involved in intracellular biomineraliza-
tion will have deep implications on our understanding
of how microbial communities interact with minerals in
calcifying environment and their impact on the global
carbon cycle at the surface of the Earth.
The present job will consist in studying these partic-
ular cyanobacteria that are cultured in the laboratory
and for which we have already obtained their genome
sequences. Dierent lines of research are considered:
1) comparative genomics of intracellularly calcifying
strains (eventually including additional genomes of
newly discovered calcifying strains) with non-calcifying
cyanobacteria to pinpoint candidate genes involved in
biomineralization; 2) search in sequenced genomes for
candidate genes potentially involved in biomineraliza-
tion and testing their role on carbonate precipitation by
heterologous expression in E. coli or any other pertinent
model organism; 3) transcriptomics of Gloeomargarita
under two culturing conditions: one allowing intracellu-
lar biomineralization and the other one not allowing it;
4) extract proteins from intracellular inclusions of car-
bonates and characterize these proteins by biochemicalanalysis to help testing the role of specic proteins in
biomineralization.
The candidate should have a strong experience in ge-
nomics, transcriptomics and proteomics or at least in
one of these elds, ideally with a double formation in
bioinformatics and wet laboratory techniques. Most
importantly, she/he should be motivated by working
on an interdisciplinary topic. She/he should have skills
for working in a team and supervising PhD students,
conducting her/his research autonomously and commu-
nicate her/his results in English.
The funding is for 2 or 3 years. It is provided by a
Starting Grant from the European Research Council
(ERC). Employment will be arranged by the adminis-
tration of CNRS. The position can open as soon as Jan-
uary, 1st 2013 and should be lled no later than May
2013. Candidates should send a detailed CV with a
letter of motivation explaining the motivations for this
job to Karim Benzerara, Geobiology team at the Insti-
tute of Mineralogy and Physics of Condensed Matter;

Epigenetic transgenerational eects of parental age on
tness
THE PROJECT
The house sparrow is a major model system for the
study of evolutionary physiology, behavioural ecology
and molecular ecology. Terry Burke (University of
Sheeld, UoS) has studied the wild house sparrow
population on Lundy Island since 1997, in cooperation
with Mark Rees (UoS), Shinichi Nakagawa (University
of Otago), Julia Schroeder (Max Planck Institute for
Ornithology, Seewiesen, Germany, MPIO) and others.
This has led to fascinating new insights about sexually
selected ornamentation, parental care behaviour, and
senescence of tness correlates in this system.
This project, funded by the UK Natural Environ-
ment Research Council, is a collaboration between UoS,
MPIO, and Otago, in which we will make inferences
from the long-term dataset on the pedigreed, wild
Lundy island population and use focused experiments
on the captive sparrow population to test the hypothe-
ses so generated. Specically, we will test the potential
mechanisms underlying the transgenerational eects of
parental age, such as telomere length, stress hormones
and other factors. We also aim at testing the implica-
tions of transgenerational senescence for the evolution-
ary theory of ageing. This project will generate new
insights on the prevalence, consequences, and mecha-
nisms of epigenetic transgenerational senescence.
The post-holder will assist in a project on trans-
generational senescence using two world-class studypopulations: a long-term dataset on house sparrows on
Lundy Island, UK, and a captive breeding population
of house sparrows at the Max Planck Institute for Or-
nithology in Seewiesen, Germany (MPIO). Applicants
should have a PhD (or equivalent experience) in evo-
lutionary biology or evolutionary physiology, and have
experience of advanced statistical methods. Analytical
methods include Bayesian mixed modelling, among oth-
ers, for meta-analysis and programming for individual-
based simulations. The successful candidate will spend
time conducting experiments on captive birds in Ger-
many. The project is currently funded until April 2016.
The post is available from 1st January 2013
for 39 months, with an initial appointment of
one year. NERC funded. Please apply online:

AncientPathogenGenomics
The Paeleogenetics group at the Faculty of Mathe-
matics and Natural Sciences, T ubingen University, is
searching for
Two research fellows (postdocs, TVL-E13)
for a period of 2 years, with potential extension up to
5 years starting in
January 2013 or later.
POSITION SUMMARY
We are looking for two Postdoctoral Research Fellows
with a strong bioinformatics background to study the
evolution and genetic reconstruction of pathogen and
human DNA from an archaeological context using next
generation sequencing data.
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES
Both positions are funded by the European Research
Council (ERC) as part of a 5 year starting grant with
the title \Ancient Pathogen Genomics or re-emerging
infectious disease" (APGREID). The aim of the project
is to study ancient pathogen genomes from histori-
cal pandemics as well as host pathogen interactions
throughout time. The primary focus of the research
fellows will be the computational reconstruction of an-
cient pathogen genomes, comparisons of these genomes
to modern pathogen strains in a phylogenetic context,
and an evaluation of how the noted genetic changes may
have inuenced virulence over time. We are further-
more interested in calculating mutation rates and diver-
gence times of modern and historical pathogen strains.
A second project will involve the analysis of immunity
related genes from human host populations throughout
major historical pandemics to get direct insights into
host pathogen interactions over time. This research
will be focused on pathogens of viral and bacterial ori-
gin that continue to aect human populations today.
Both positions may involve eldtrips in order to identify
and sample skeletal remains from historical contexts.Both positions are part of the same research project
and will be directly supervised by the PI. The work-
ing climate in the paleogenetics group is open with low
hierarchical structures and involves brainstorming and
interactions with all the team members during weekly
meetings and informal discussions.
Supervisory Responsibilities: Both Research Fellows
may be expected to co-supervise a PhD student each
and potentially other junior sta to assist with the
project.
QUALIFICATIONS
A completed Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, Microbiology,
Evolutionary Biology, Population genetics, or a related
eld; post-doctoral research experience is a plus.
SKILLS
A strong sense of team spirit and diplomacy is a require-
ment. The candidates should have a strong background
in bacterial or viral genetics and pathogen evolution.
Procient background in bioinformatics including ex-
perience with next generation sequencing data analysis
is a must (e.g. BWA, samtools, GATK). Software skills
should include, but not be limited to, most of the fol-
lowing: prociency in general statistical analysis such
as R (model testing, etc.); phylogenetic and evolution-
ary analysis for building phylogenetic trees and other
programs for alignment and building likelihood and
Bayesian trees (esp. BEAST). Excellent written and
verbal communication skills in English and a proven
track record in writing and publishing manuscripts are
required.
START DATE:
There is a proposed start date of January 1st, 2013.
This starts as a two-year position, however funding is
available for 5 years in total. Salary is based on the
German public funding system(TVL-E13).
How to Apply:
In order to be considered all eligible candidates must
email the following
three items: (a) one page cover letter, (b) CV, and (c)
three references
to Johannes.krause@uni-tuebingen.de.

MarineMicrobeEvolution
A 3-year, ERC-funded, postdoctoral research position
is available with Sin ead Collins at the University of Ed-
inburgh (http://www.smallbutmighty.bio.ed.ac.uk/).
Evolution of Ostreococcus tauri in the face of multiple
environmental stressors
Because marine phytoplankton have large population
sizes and reproduce quickly, they have the potential to
evolve over months or years, and there is evidence that
both freshwater microalgae and calcifying marine phy-
toplankton can evolve in response to CO2 enrichment.
Laboratory studies are typically done in simple environ-
ments, whereas all species evolving in the wild must do
so in environments where many stressors co-occur. Cur-
rent evolutionary theory (mainly from evo-devo) deals
primarily with the eect of organismal complexity on
evolutionary dynamics and outcomes. This project will
use experimental microbial evolution to investigate how
the complexity of environmental change aects evolu-
tion in several ecotypes of Ostreococcus tauri. While
the overarching theme of the project is xed, there is
plenty of opportunity to gear the project towards the
particular interests and expertise of the successful can-
didate (ie - this can be a microbial ecology project, or
an evolutionary genetics project), and the successful
candidate will be expected to contribute creatively to
the project.
Interested candidates must hold a PhD in evolutionary
biology or marine microbiology, with a strong interest
in whichever of the two elds they are not formally
trained in. Laboratory experience is required.
Starting time is exible but must be before May 1, 2013.
Ongoing interviews will be held until a suitable candi-
date is found.

Postdoctoral Position available at the University of Fri-
bourg, Switzerland Department of Biology / Ecology &
Evolution Postdoctoral Position in Invasion Biology &
Biological Control Rationale:
Common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (Aster-
aceae), has uniquely raised the awareness of invasive
alien plants in Europe. A main problem with this plant
is its particularly large production of highly allergenic
pollen generating huge medical costs and reduced qual-
ity of life among the allergic population. The major-
ity of land infested by ragweed in Europe is non-crop
land. However, ragweed also has increasingly become
a major weed in European agriculture, especially in
spring-sown crops such as sunower, maize, sugar beet
and soya beans. The threat of ragweed is further ac-
centuated by climate change, posing a signicant risk
to society even in countries presently not aected. In
June 2012, we received approval for a coordinated Eu-
ropean research program on \Sustainable Management
of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe" (COST FA1203-
SMARTER). We expect to ocially start by Novem-
ber 2012. By now, more than 20 countries have signed
the Memorandum of Understanding to participate in
this Action, with more than 100 researchers involved
so far. A main component will be to develop a bio-
logical control program for ragweed in Europe, consti-
tuting the rst European-wide weed biocontrol project.
For this, we can capitalize on recent biocontrol achieve-
ments in Australia and China and on a recent review on
prospects for biological control of Ambrosia artemisiifo-
lia, in which we discuss and propose a prioritization of
biological control candidates for both a classical and
for a inundative biological control approach in Europe
(Gerber et al. 2011; Weed Research 51, 559-573).
We now seek a highly motivated person to join our team
at the University of Fribourg. Initially, the position will
involve project development (support of the coordina-
tor in developing the Action, particularly the biocontrol
component) and will then shift to a full research posi-
tion on the ecacy and biosafety of selected biological
control agents, and the integration of biological control
into other management measures.November 1, 2012 EvolDir 117
Requirements Doctoral degree, preferentially in the
eld of plant invasions, entomology and/or biological
weed control.
Salary and conditions Salary dependent on age and sta-
tus (gross salary in the rst year about CHF 60'000).
Start date: preferentially 1 Nov. 2012, or early 2013.
The position is initially for 1 year, but we will seek for
funding to extend it to 2-3 years.

Postdoctoral position at University of Jyv askyl a (De-

Finland
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF CO-INFECTIONS
IN PARASITES WITH COMPLEX LIFE CYCLES
Wild hosts are typically infected with a range of par-
asite species and genotypes of one species at the same
time. This has signicant implications for parasite-
parasite interactions (one factor underlying parasite
virulence) and for host's ability to defend itself against
infections. These associations may also be subjected to
considerable variation depending on the stage of a par-
asite life cycle. This is particularly true for parasites
with complex life cycles that include several consecu-
tive hosts with dierent conditions for co-infections ineach. However, very little is currently known about
these interactions in natural host-parasite systems.
We are looking for candidates to ll a postdoctoral po-
sition in a project exploring responses of parasites and
their hosts to multiple parasite species and genotype in-
fections. The aims of the project are to determine (1)
the role of antagonistic and facilitative parasite inter-
actions in shaping co-infection dynamics, (2) the role
of dierent types of host responses in determining the
outcome of multiple infections, and (3) the inuence of
spatiotemporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions
on patterns of parasite community assembly. Consider-
able latitude in specic research questions will be given
according to personal interests of the candidate.
Candidates should have a PhD in evolutionary biol-
ogy/genetics/parasitology, or related eld. Starting
date is 1st of January 2013 or soon after, duration of
the post is 2 years. The post is funded by the Academy
of Finland with a salary of approx. 2900-3600 Euros
per month depending on the qualications of the can-
didate.
If interested, send a brief description of work experience
and interests along with CV, list of publications, and
contact details of at least two references as a single PDF
to Dr. Anssi Karvonen (anssi.t.karvonen@jyu.). Can-

ULausanne DrosophilaGenomics
Postdoc: genomics of experimental evolution in
Drosophila
A postdoctoral position is available in Tad Kawecki's
group at the Department of Ecology and Evolution,University of Lausanne, Switzerland. We are look-
ing for a qualied and motivated researcher for a
project aiming to uncover candidate genetic and molec-
ular changes underlying evolution of improved tol-
erance to chronic juvenile (larval) malnutrition in
Drosophila melanogaster. The project will involve
whole-genome resequencing of replicated Drosophila
populations which, in the course of 150 generations
of experimental evolution, evolved markedly improved
ability to develop on a low quality food. At the phe-
notypic level, these populations show a variety of life
history, physiological and behavioral adaptations, and
the project will help to uncover their genomic bases, as
well as point to other mechanisms of malnutrition tol-
erance. The postdoc will also collaborate/co-supervise
a PhD student carrying out RNAseq on the same pop-
ulations. It has been increasingly recognized that re-
sponses to nutritional stress during development may
have far-reaching consequences for adult life, including
the rate of aging. At the same time, mechanisms of
responses to nutritional environment seem highly con-
served. Thus understanding how evolution shapes these
responses is likely to throw light on early-life determi-
nants of human aging and metabolic disease.
The project requires a good background in bioinfor-
matics, statistics and/or population genetics, and an
interest in adaptive evolution. Wet lab skills are not
essential. The candidate is expected to start in the
rst half of 2013 (negotiable). The project is envisioned
for two years; prolongation for up to 5 years on follow
up or other projects may be possible. The initial an-
nual salary is about CHF 60,650 (about US$ 65,000 or
Euro 50,000). The group is English-speaking and no-
preexisting knowledge of French is required, but learn-
ing basic French would make living in Lausanne easier.
Lausanne is a medium-sized city on the shores of Lake
Geneva, surrounded by a wine growing region recog-
nized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and within
one hour of the Alps. It oers a great variety of cultural,
recreational and outdoor opportunities. The Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution (www.unil.ch/dee) is a
vibrant research community, with 22 research groups,
over 100 graduate students and over 40 postdocs, and
is the lead institution of the inter-university Doctoral

UNeuchatel HostParasiteEvolution
A 3-year postdoc position, funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation for research on the evolutionary120 EvolDir November 1, 2012
ecology of host-parasite interactions is available in the
group of Jacob Koella at the University of Neuch^ atel
from February 1, 2013 (with some exibility).
The general goal of my group is to integrate evolution-
ary and ecological thinking into the epidemiology and
control of infectious diseases. We develop the theoreti-
cal basis of this integration and test empirically the as-
sumptions and predictions of the theory, using malaria,
microsporidians and their mosquito hosts as experimen-
tal systems.
The postdoc-project will integrate resource ecology
with the within-host dynamics of parasite to obtain a
better picture of the evolution of the host-parasite in-
teraction. This approach explicitly takes into account
a fundamental, yet largely neglected, aspect of para-
sites: that they steal resources from their host to sup-
port their own development. Resource ecology thus
gives a mechanistic basis of the host's and the para-
site's development, and thereby brings theory in closer
contact with experimental observations, leading to a
more realistic description of the host-parasite interac-
tion. The experimental system will be the microsporid-
ian *Vavraia culicis* and its host, the mosquito *Aedes
aegypti*.
The postdoc will collaborate with a PhD student to be
hired on the same grant to integrate the theoretical and
experimental approaches of the project. I expect that
the postdoc will work theoretically end experimentally;
the balance of the two approaches depends on the post-
doc's and the PhD student's interests.
The position requires an independent, highly moti-
vated, creative, and scientically curious individual
with a strong background in evolutionary biology and
an interest in parasitology. Good knowledge of evolu-
tionary theory is a prerequisite. The generous salary is
in accordance with the standards of the Swiss National
Science Foundation.
Neuch^ atel is located in the French part of Switzerland
and is an attractive city with a high quality of life. The
city is located on the shore of Lake Neuch^ atel with the
Jura Mountains to the North and a view of the Bernese
Alps to the South. For outdoors enthusiasts, this is
an excellent area for outdoor activities such as hiking,
climbing or skiing.
Formal applications should include: a cover letter (in
English) indicating research interests, your CV includ-
ing a summary of previous research, and two letters of
reference. Application deadline is November 18, 2012.

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION IN IN-
SECT POPULATION BIOLOGY/GENETICS
A post-doctoral position is available as part of a collab-
orative project between Cornell University and USDA-
APHIS to develop microsatellite markers and SNPs for
distinguishing geographic populations of gypsy moth.
We have identied large numbers of microsatellites and
SNPs that need to be evaluated for their utility in dis-
tinguishing between gypsy moth populations from Asia
and those already present in North America (intro-122 EvolDir November 1, 2012
duced from Europe). The candidate will also be part of
a collaboration to identify markers linked to traits (fe-
male ight, etc.) in the Asian strains that the USDA
considers a threat to the forest systems of the US and
to the ability of USDA to manage gypsy moth pro-
grams in the US. The person lling the position will be
hired by Cornell University and will be under the di-
rection of Dr. Richard Harrison in the Department of
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. However, the can-
didate will be stationed at and most of the work will
be done at the USDA Otis Center for Plant Health Sci-
ence and Technology Laboratory, located on Cape Cod
in Buzzards Bay, MA. This USDA laboratory is fully
equipped to conduct the work and importantly has a
collection of samples from throughout the range of the
gypsy moth, totaling over 15,000 specimens. The goal
of the project is to develop a suite of markers that can
distinguish moths intercepted/trapped in the United
States that are of Asian origin. Additional, related
work may include developing bar codes to distinguish
other Lymantriid species.
The individual will also have the opportunity to col-
laborate on work on pest identication issues related to
other organisms targeted by APHIS in its exclusion or
managements programs. Two ongoing studies are (1)
a port monitoring program that aims to provide bar
codes for intercepted wood boring insects, and (2) a
large multi-state eradication program for the Asian long
horned beetle that needs to distinguish the source(s) of
recently established populations.
Qualications: The successful candidate must have
a Ph.D. and experience using molecular techniques
(PCR, sequencing, genotyping) in population biology
as well as familiarity with methods of analysis of the
genetic structure of natural populations. Ideally, the
candidate would have direct experience with generat-
ing and analyzing microsatellite and/or SNP data.
Terms of Appointment: Starting salary is $40,000-
$42,000, depending on experience. Funds are available
for one year, and renewable for a second year pending
satisfactory progress. The position is available imme-
diately.
How to apply: Applicants should send via e-mail a CV
and a cover letter explaining their interest in the posi-
tion to Richard Harrison (rgh4@cornell.edu) in the De-
partment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cor-
nell University. Applicants should also arrange to have
2-3 letters of reference sent via e-mail to the above ad-
dress. Applications should be sent as soon as possible,
but must be received no later than November 15.

UZurich PhyloSystematics
Post-doctoral position in macro-evolution and phyloge-
netic systematics, available from 1 January 2013. This
position is part of a large existing project, in which we
explore the patterns of radiation in the Angiosperms.
We are linking plant functional traits to climate change,
to shifts in the phylogenetic rates, and \groundproof-
ing" the patterns against the fossil record. The team
includes a palaeobotanist (Yaowu Xing), who has com-
piled the largest existing database of Angiosperm fossils
from the Cenozoic. The plant functional data is being
assembled by a PhD student, Renske Onstein. She has
already compiled substantial datasets on various fami-
lies and orders. What we need now is a phylogeneticist,
who will assemble the trees over which the rate shifts,
climate shifts, and plant trait shifts are modelled. This
involves downloading datasets from Genbank, build-
ing the trees, and dating them, then calculating rate
shifts. The successful candidate will have experience
using the relevant softwares (MEDUSA, RaXML, Mr-124 EvolDir November 1, 2012
Bayes, BEAST), and experience with R analyses.
Funding is denite for a year, but might be extended
for another two years.
If you are interested, could you send me (Peter Linder:

a) A letter detailing why this interests you
b) CV
c) Two possible referees.

Flycatcher speciation genomics
2 postdoc positions at the Evolutionary Biology Centre,
Uppsala University in the group of Prof Hans Ellegren
(see end of message for web page)
Each position is for two years with the possibility of
extension for two more years
Advances in large-scale genomics open new opportuni-
ties in speciation research. It allows us to address ques-
tions such as the genes underlying the process of speci-
ation, the character of genomic divergence during spe-
ciation, and speciation-with-gene-ow. Flycatchers of
the genus Ficedula oer an excellent model system for
studies of these and related questions (see e.g. Nature
387:589-592, 411:45-50, Science 318:95-97). We have re-
cently sequenced and de novo assembled the ycatcher
genome (at 85x coverage and with a scaold N50 of 7.3
Mb) and performed genome-wide re-sequencing of mul-
tiple individuals (each at 5x coverage) of the two closely
related species, collared ycatcher and pied ycatcher
(Nature, in press; doi:10.1038/nature11584). By this
we have identied a number of 'divergence islands',
many of which are associated with centromeres and
telomeres, potentially indicating a role for meiotic drive
in species divergence. We are now seeking new postdocs
to join t his long-term project in which coming research
will use data from whole-genome re-sequencing of mul-
tiple populations (sympatric as well as allopatric) and
species, from a 50K SNP array (genotyping in pedi-
grees and population samples) and from the ycatcher
transcriptome and methylome. Genomic parameters
that will be analyzed include, for example, recombi-
nation rates, linkage disequilibrium, expression diver-gence, and epigenetic modication. Successful candi-
dates will have the possibility to choose among sev-
eral possible directions of research, in dialogue with the
host.
The venue for these positions, the Evolutionary Biology
Centre, is situated in recently-built localities in cen-
tral Uppsala. The working atmosphere is international
with a regular recruitment of PhD students and post-
docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes an exciting
arena for multidisciplinary research in evolutionary bi-
ology in a broad sense, housing some 300 scientists and
graduate students, and with research programs in, for
example, ecology, genetics, genomics and developmen-
tal biology. The scientic environment with numerous
seminars, journal clubs and social activities oer ex-
cellent possibilities for contacts and collaborations. A
graduate school in 'The Genomics of Phenotypic Diver-
sity in Natural Populations' (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
education/postgrad/gradschool/) provides a frame-
work for courses and other activities for PhD students.
Local platforms for next-generation sequencing (http:/-
/www.scilifelab.uu.se) and high-performance computa-
tional analyses (http://ww w.uppmax.uu.se) ensure
immediate access to state-of-the-art technology. Up-
psala University is the oldest university in Scandinavia
and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with
beautiful and easy accessible surroundings conveniently
situated close to Stockholm.
The positions, which are funded by a European Re-
search Council Advanced Investigator Grant, are ali-
ated with the Department of Evolutionary Biology - an
overview of the research activities in the environment
can be found at our web pages (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
Research/IEG/evbiol/). Thanks to a number of com-
petitive grants recently obtained, the environment has
expanded signicantly and houses 8 independent re-
search groups and about 20 PhD students, 20 post-
docs, and some bioinformaticians. A common theme
is that we address key questions in evolutionary biol-
ogy, like speciation, local adaptation, life history evo-
lution, genome and molecular evolution, using genomic
approaches. Study organisms include natural bird and
plant populations, Neurospora, Drosophila, zebra sh,
domestic animals and humans. We have tight connec-
tions with several other research programs at the Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre.
Suitable background to these positions is a PhD
geared toward speciation genetics, population genet-
ics or bioinformatics. Experience from bioinformatic
analyses of next-generation sequencing data is of
merit. Competition might be erce so Informal in-
quiries and applications should be sent by email to

WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGENETICS
at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, California
March 2V9, 2013
Sponsored by the University of California, Davis and
Bodega Marine Laboratory (additional nancial sup-
port provided by the University of Rochester)
http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Front Page Intro-
duction Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized
modern systematics and become indispensable tools
in evolution, ecology and comparative biology, playing
an increasingly important role in analyses of biological
data at levels of organization ranging from molecules
to ecological communities. The estimation of phyloge-
netic trees is now a formalized statistical problem with
general agreement on the central issues and questions.A nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
This Spring, for the fourteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-
vances in phylogenetic methodology, and then focuses
on methods and tools that can be brought to bear on
these \applied" issues in the context of a given phy-
logeny.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the Northern California coast, which has on-site
housing. Our newly increased bandwidth and access
to computing clusters allows us to utilize computer-126 EvolDir November 1, 2012
intensive approaches even in a one-week course. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, dis-
cussion, and hands-on software training. One afternoon
during the week will be left free for eld trips to local
natural areas.
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesian
and Maximum-likelihood estimation of phylogeny * Es-
timation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree con-
icts * Divergence-time estimation from sequence data:
relaxed clocks, fossil calibration * Analysis of charac-
ter evolution: maximum likelihood and Bayesian ap-
proaches, ancestral-state estimation, rates of trait evo-
lution * Analysis of morphological form, function of
complex character systems * Inference of diversica-
tion rates: detecting rate shifts, testing key innovation
hypotheses * Model specication issues: model selec-
tion, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing MCMC
performance

the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Front
Royal, VA, USA Visit http://SMconservation.gmu.edu
or contact SCBItraining@si.edu for more information.
This course is an introduction for graduate students and
professionals to the applications, benets, and draw-
backs of non-invasive genetic techniques to wildlife con-
servation. The course will concentrate on the use of
non-invasive techniques to answer questions in animal
behavior, population biology, and population manage-
ment, with a particular focus on the conservation of
mammalian populations. Participants gain hands-on
experience with all stages of a research project utilizing
modern non-invasive methods by working with expert
researchers through a combination of eld, laboratory
and computer-based modules.
Throughout the course participants work through a di-
rected research project, progressing from study design
through eld data collection, sampling protocols, and
DNA extraction and amplication, to analysis of mi-
crosatellite and sequence data using the most eective
and accessible software packages. The course focuses
on relatedness, population size estimation and popu-
lation dynamics; additional lectures address genotype
reliability, research applications for ancient DNA, and
applications of next-generation pyrosequencing.
Many of these groundbreaking non-invasive genetic
techniques were initially developed at the Smithsonian's
National Zoo and its Center for Conservation and Evo-
lutionary Genetics (CCEG). Course instructors include
scientists from CCEG (Drs. Jesus Maldonado and Rob
Fleischer) and George Mason University (Dr. Christine
Bozarth) and several expert visiting instructors includ-
ing Drs. Mike Schwartz, Elizabeth Archie, and Lori Eg-
gert. While most instruction takes place in Front Royal
at the newly opened facilities of the Smithsonian-Mason
School of Conservation, the course also includes labo-
ratory work at the National Zoo's new state-of-the-art
genetics lab in Washington, DC.
The total course fee, which includes instruction and
course materials, food, shared lodging, and trans-
port to/from Washington-Dulles International Airport
(IAD) is $2,142. All other travel costs and inciden-
tal expenses are the participant's responsibility. Par-
ticipants earn Continuing Education Units; graduate
course credit (2) is available for qualied applicants
through George Mason University at an additional
fee. Participants should have previously completed
a college-level genetics and basic ecology/evolution
course. For rst consideration, apply before February
23, 2013. This course has been full during all previous
oerings, so you are encouraged to apply early.

EvolutionaryDynamics Nov11-15132 EvolDir November 1, 2012
Dear EvolDir members,
this is the 2nd announcement of our upcoming course on
Evolutionary Dynamics. The Research School Ecology
& Evolution of the Centre for Ecological and Evolu-
tionary Studies (U. Groningen, Netherlands) organizes
a PhD level course on Evolutionary Dynamics at the
\Assumburg" Castle in Heemskerk, the Netherlands.
The course is also accessible to advanced Master level
students.
Aim of the course Obtain a basic understanding of dif-
ferent theories for slow and fast evolutionary dynam-
ics. Become able to independently increase this under-
standing further. Be able to apply the tools presented
to simple population dynamical models, to turn them
into evolutionary dynamical systems.
Contents & Structure Evolution can be fast or very
slow. Comparisons of related species often reveal evi-
dence that evolution proceeds gradually or in discrete
jumps, or that species dierences appear to be caused
by drift. In recent years, the new framework of Adap-
tive Dynamics (AD) has joined the ranks of popula-
tion genetics, quantitative genetics, evolutionary game
theory, comparative analysis and optimization theory
as a method to study adaptive evolution. Methods of
AD apply to slow evolutionary processes, but they have
counterparts in many of the other types of evolution-
ary analysis for fast evolutionary processes, where they
all rely on a selection gradient and a genetic variance-
covariance matrix. We want to stress the similarities
of several approaches by presenting their basics in a
single course. Lectures cover both the basics of quan-
titative genetics, theories of selection response, adap-
tive dynamics, and comparative analysis. The lectures
primarily focus on concepts, and use mathematics and
simulation as a tool. Examples of how theories have
been successfully applied to real biological systems are
presented in every lecture. For example, topics such
as specialization and adaptive speciation will be dis-
cussed. The course will consist of lectures, computer
exercise classes, and literature discussion groups.
Our guest lecturer during the course will be
Luis-Miguel Chevin [https://sites.google.com/site/-
luismiguelchevin/], who will lecture on his own research
and who will be available for discussions.
The course will be held from 12 - 15 November 2011
at the \Assumburg" Castle in Heemskerk, the Nether-
lands. It is advised to bring your own laptop.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
