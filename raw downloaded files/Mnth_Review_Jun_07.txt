Hangzhou QuantGenetics Aug19-24
Announcement The 3rd International Conference on
Quantitative Genetics (ICQG3) will be held during Au-
gust 19-24, 2007, in Hangzhou, China. As with the 1st
ICQG in Ames, Iowa in 1976 and the 2nd ICQG inRaleigh, North Carolina in 1987, the 3rd Conference
will be a comprehensive survey of the current status of
quantitative genetics. New technologies in areas rang-
ing from genomics and molecular genetics to statistics
are providing both opportunities and challenges for our
understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits
in natural populations, the evolution of characters, and
use for plant and animal breeding. The Conference wel-
comes participants to submit contributed papers. Only
an abstract is needed and is to be submitted at regis-
tration for the conference. A limited number of con-
tributed papers will be selected for oral presentation in
an appropriate session of the conference and all oth-
ers will be presented in formal poster sessions. The
deadline for the abstract submission for the selection
of oral presentation has now been extended to June 1,
2007. The Conference will be held in an international
hotel, the Yellow Dragon Hotel, in the downtown of
Hangzhou. The program listing invited speakers is on
the website. Please check out the conference website
http://www.icqg.org/ for more information about the
conference and for registration and abstract submission.

London Linnaeus Jun1
In Linnaeus’ Wake: 300 years of marine discovery
A meeting, to be hosted at the Linnean Society of Lon-
don with an evening reception on the Swedish Ship
G¨ otheborg on the River Thames
June 1, 2007
The fundamental contribution of Linnaeus to the sci-
entiﬁc world - a system of nomenclature and classiﬁca-
tion - was underpinned by his collections and those of
his Apostles’, made possible in the mid 18th Century
by the maritime power of European nations. Ships,
and shipping companies such as the Swedish East In-
dia Company (SOIC), were used by Linnaeus to ex-
pand his collections from all over the globe. To cel-
ebrate both the tercentenary of Linnaeus’ birth, and
the arrival of the Swedish Ship G¨ otheborg in London
(an exact replica of the 18th Century East Indiaman
G¨ otheborg used by the SOIC), a scientiﬁc meeting will
be hosted this summer at the Linnean Society of Lon-
don with an evening reception aboard the vessel moored
on the River Thames.
The meeting will cover the historical importance of the
SOIC and Linnaeus, life aboard an 18th century ves-
sel, and scientiﬁcally will focus on marine systematic
and taxonomic discoveries from the last three hundred
years. It will show how in the age of DNA sequenc-
ing and deep-sea robotic submarines, much of marine
science is still in the discovery phase’, just as it was
in Linnaeus’ day. Our meeting, jointly sponsored by
G¨ oteborg University, Zoologica Scripta, the Hasselblad
Foundation, the Linnean Society and The Natural His-
tory Museum will celebrate the life of Linnaeus and his
legacy, and show what an 18th century square-rigged
East Indiaman was like for the scientist and sailor.
Speakers will include: Dr Tony Rice, Prof Phil Rain-
bow, Dr Katrin Linse, Dr Ben Wigham, Dr Kenneth
Nyberg, Dr Hans Nyman, Dr John Taylor, Dr Alex
Rogers, Joakim Severinson

CALL FOR REGISTRATIONS AND PAPERS This
informal, annual meeting is designed to bring together
people starting their research on molluscs, to give them
the opportunity to present and discuss their work and
to compare notes on methods and problems.
Attendance is open to all, but speakers and poster pre-
senters should be research students, post-doctoral re-
searchers, undergraduates starting molluscan projects
or dissertations, and amateurs engaged in substantial
projects, which have not yet been published. Any
topic related to molluscs is acceptable: palaeontolog-
ical, physiological, behavioural, ecological, systematic,
morphological or molecular.
Short talks (15 min) or posters may be oﬀered. They
need not be polished accounts of completed work: de-
scriptions of new methods, work in progress, appeals for
assistance with unsolved problems are equally accept-
able. Powerpoint presentations are the usual form, but
should be discussed in advance (see registration form
overleaf).
In addition to talks and posters there will be oppor-
tunities to acquire reprints contributed by members of
the Society. The forum will end with a wine reception.
There is no registration fee; a limited amount of help
with travel costs will be available for presenters who
cannot claim them from elsewhere.

The Jacques Monod Conference “Evolutionary genetics
of host-parasite relationships” aims to provide a state
of the art assessment of what evolutionary thinking can
contribute to an integrated understanding of the pro-
cesses shaping host-parasite interactions. The confer-
ence is structured in three major topics, which are inti-
mately linked with each other. Topic 1. Understanding
the genetic interactions between hosts and parasites.
Topic 2. Host and parasite evolution and the mainte-
nance of sexual reproduction Topic 3. The evolutionary
genetics of immune defence.

Dear Colleagues, please note the upcoming conference:June 1, 2007 EvolDir 11
“Origin and Evolution of Biota in Mediterranean Cli-
mate Zones: An Integrative Vision”
14-15 July 2007, University of Zurich, Switzerland.
Registration deadline: May 30, 2007
Understanding the biotic and abiotic processes that
contribute to high species numbers in biodiversity ’hot
spots’ is one of the major tasks of biology. The ex-
ceptional biological richness of the ﬁve mediterranean
climate zones of the earth - the Mediterranean basin,
South Africa, Australia, Chile and California - makes
them an ideal case study to investigate the evolutionary
and ecological dynamics that generate elevated species
numbers. By focusing on the Mediterranean basin, the
conference will synthesize the current state of knowl-
edge on the origin of mediterranean biota, while chart-
ing a map for pushing the frontier of conceptual and
methodological advances in biodiversity studies. The
goal of the conference is to clarify the history of biotic
assembly in mediterranean climate zones by integrat-
ing evidence across multiple disciplines, including evo-
lutionary biology, systematics, ecology, paleontology,
paleoclimatology, and paleogeology. Target audience
The conference is aimed at scholars from various bio-
diversity disciplines at diﬀerent stages of their careers,
from beginning Ph.D. students to established scholars.

Three funded PhD studentships in Population Ecology
and Population Genetics at the Professorship of Ecosys-
tem Management, ETH Zurich, Switzerland.14 EvolDir June 1, 2007
*Title:* Integrating genetic diversity and phenotypic
plasticity into plant population responses to climate
change in the Alps
*Start Date:* January 2008
The Professorship of Ecosystem Management is oﬀer-
ing three PhD positions in Plant Ecology and Ecological
Genetics to address the relative importance of intrinsic
adaptive variation, local (pre-) adaptation and pheno-
typic plasticity to Alpine plant populations abilities to
adapt to climate change.
All three projects will be supervised by Prof. Dr.
Jaboury Ghazoul, Dr. Andrea R. Pluess and Dr. Chris
Kettle, and will form part of the BIOCHANGE plat-
form at ETH Zurich.
*Project: * Alpine plant populations are predicted to
shift to higher elevations in response to climate change.
Under such conditions core populations will move to
higher elevations currently occupied by peripheral pop-
ulations occupying the present species range limits.
Should conservation eﬀorts prioritize the current core
populations which are predicted to contain greater ge-
netic diversity or small isolated peripheral populations?
We will investigate the relative importance of intrin-
sic adaptive variation, local (pre-) adaptation and phe-
notypic plasticity to Alpine plant populations abilities
to adapt to climate change. Key questions include: 1)
Does local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in high-
altitude peripheral populations infer an advantage over
core populations under predicted climate change sce-
narios? 2) Do small peripheral populations which are
predicted to have lower genetic diversity than large cen-
tral populations, have reduced adaptive potential? 3)
Does gene ﬂow via pollen between core and peripheral
populations undermine local adaptation of peripheral
populations and can this lead to outbreeding depres-
sion. These questions will be addressed using ﬁeld-
based reciprocal transplant experiments, experimental
populations in climate-controlled chambers, artiﬁcial
inter-population breeding experiments and direct and
indirect measures of gene ﬂow using molecular mark-
ers.
*Requirements:* We are seeking three highly motivated
applicants, with a desire to work on the ecology and ge-
netics of alpine plants in the context of climate change.
Applicants should have a B.Sc and M.Sc degree, prefer-
ably with experience in experimental population biol-
ogy, statistics, and ideally molecular work. Excellent
spoken and written English is required, and German
would be highly advantageous though not strictly nec-
essary. Applicants should enjoy working both in the
ﬁeld (Swiss pre-alpine and alpine area) and in the labo-ratory. The three PhD positions will be part of a team
of researchers working on the general theme of plant
responses to climate change in alpine systems, and will
also be members of the Ecosystem Management group,
led by Prof. Jaboury Ghazoul. Therefore, we place a
strong emphasis on cooperation and team work. Re-
quests for additional information on the three positions
oﬀered, or other informal enquiries, should be made
to Dr. Pluess andrea.pluess(at)env.ethz.ch, tel: +41
(0)44 632 89 75. Information about the research group
can be found at http://www.ecology.ethz.ch/ *Con-
ditions of Employment:* Three years appointment at
ETH, Zurich. Starting Salary: minimum 37,600 Swiss
Francs per year.
*Application: * Please send a letter of motiva-
tion, CV and names and addresses of two aca-
demic referees to Dr. Andrea Pluess, by e-Mail (an-
drea.pluess(at)env.ethz.ch).
*Deadline:* 10th July 2007

ulations but the ecology, dynamics and eﬀects of the
pathogens are still largely unknown. A combination of
ﬁeld work and experiment could be arranged depending
on the student interests. The candidate is encouraged
to create and develop his/her own project in the men-
tioned area. Good aptitude for ﬁeldwork, molecular
ecology skills and especially population genetics basics
are expected as well as good communication skills.
A minimum stipend ($15.000 CAD) will be provided as
well as opportunities for additional scholarships.

MasseyU EarlyEukaryotes
PhD Scholarship: Cell biology of early eukaryotes
Supervisors, Lesley J Collins and David Penny The
Allan Wilson Center for Molecular Ecology and Evo-
lution, Massey University, Palmerston North, New
Zealand ( http://awcmee.massey.ac.nz/ ) has a PhD
Scholarship for an Integrated Bioinformatics approach
to understanding the basic cell biological evolution of
eukaryotes.
1. By combing bioinformatics and information on gene
function and subcellular location we are beginning to
build an excellent picture of the ancestral eukaryote
cell. The project aims to help us understand both the
ultimate origin of eukaryotes, and also the main fea-
tures of the evolution of the cell biology within eukary-
otes.
Preferred skills are a good background in molecular bi-
ology of eukaryotes with a strong interest in comput-
ers and bioinformatics. The necessary training in basic
Perl or Python scripts can be learned as the project
develops.16 EvolDir June 1, 2007
2. An alternative approach could come from a more
computer science/physical science/ mathematics ap-
proach. This involves a more computer centered study
that infers, for example, ancestral sequences and aims
to reconstruct ancestral networks of related proteins in
important aspect of cellular function. Necessary skills
would require more computational skills with a good
basic knowledge of molecular biology.
3. An excellent student may wish to propose their own
approach to the topic.
Starting date: variable, depending on the academic
year of Northern or Southern Hemisphere applicants.

Two PhD Scholarships in Evolutionary Ecology (Syd-
ney, Australia)
Both projects will be based in Macquarie University’s
Centre for the Integrative Study of Animal Behaviour
(http://galliform.bhs.mq.edu.au/ ~cisab/) and are sup-
ported by MQRES Scholarships*.
Project 1. - Maintenance of polymorphism in the Goul-
dian ﬁnch
This project will investigate the persistence of the rare
yellow morph of the endangered Gouldian ﬁnch in wild
and captive populations. The general research theme
is to understand why the genetically determined yel-
low morph naturally occurs at much lower levels ( <
1%) than the red (30%) and black (70%) morphs of
this species. Based on the genetic determination of
the morphs we should expect to ﬁnd a much higher
frequency of the yellow morph in natural populations.
However, previous work has shown that yellow indi-
viduals are behaviourally dominated by the other two
morphs and also are generally avoided as mates. This
project will investigate a variety of physiological and
behavioural traits in an attempt to characterise both
positive and negative selection on the yellow morph to
understand its place in this classic balanced polymor-
phism. Although the research program into which this
project ﬁts is supported by ongoing ARC Discovery and
Linkage grants, the student will have ample room for
individual choice of speciﬁc topics and design of exper-
iments. Applicants should have a background in some
of the following areas: biology, animal behaviour, be-
havioural ecology, evolutionary ecology, genetics.
The project is based in the research group of A/Prof
Simon Griﬃth, to whom enquiries should be directed
(simon.griﬃth@mq.edu.au ) before 31 May 2007. This
project will be jointly supervised by Dr Sarah Pryke
(also in CISAB).
Project 2. - Genetic structure of the chestnut-crowned
babbler
We seek a student to investigate the genetic structure of
the cooperatively breeding chestnut-crowned babbler:
from family groups through local populations up to the
broad-scale species range in arid, and semi-arid Aus-
tralia. This research program, focusing on an avian
equivalent of the meerkat, will include ﬁeld-work, be-havioural observation and a substantial molecular com-
ponent (PCR-based microsatellite genotyping) with the
main aim of understanding the breeding system of this
species, and the way in which ecology interacts with
dispersal and local adaptation to contribute to the evo-
lution of cooperative breeding. This project will use
an ongoing study population at the Fowlers Gap Arid
Zone Research Station (far- west NSW) and a number
of other wild populations throughout the range. Al-
though the research program into which this project
ﬁts is supported by an ongoing ARC Discovery grant,
the student will have ample room for individual choice
of speciﬁc topics and design of research. Applicants
should have a background in some of the following ar-
eas: biology, animal behaviour, behavioural ecology,
evolutionary ecology, genetics.
The project is based in the research group of
A/Prof Simon Griﬃth, to whom enquiries about the
project should be directed (simon.griﬃth@mq.edu.au)
before 31 May 2007. This project will be
jointly supervised by Dr Andrew Russell (Univer-
sity of Sheﬃeld, UK, http://www.sheﬃeld.ac.uk/aps/-
contacts/acadstaﬀ/russell.html ).
* MQRES scholarships are available year round for
Australian and International students. MQRES schol-
arships include an APA-equivalent stipend (currently
AU$19,616 p.a. tax exempt), allowances for relocation
and thesis costs, international tuition fees and overseas
health cover for a maximum of 3.5 years tenure. Appli-
cants should have completed equivalent research quali-
ﬁcations to a four-year Australian Bachelor degree with
First Class Honours, such as a Bachelor degree plus a
Masters degree with a substantial research component.
AU$6,000 p.a. is provided by CISAB to all PhD stu-
dents to cover direct research expenses of their project,
and several generous internal schemes are available to
fund travel to visit overseas laboratories and to attend
conferences.

Genomics of the biomass crop Miscanthus: character-
izing variation in the plastid genome and assessing nu-18 EvolDir June 1, 2007
clear polyploid variation
A three-year PhD fellowship funded under the Wash
Fellowship Schema is available for a research project
on the biomass crop plant Miscanthus. Miscanthus
species are perennial, C4 grasses capable of tremen-
dous biomass growth under a wide range of climatic
conditions. Attention has focussed on biomass crops
because of the need for alternative energy sources for
sustainable living. Very few Miscanthus genotypes have
been assessed for their biomass potential but work is un-
derway to develop new genotypes. The overall aim of
this project is to gather essential genomic information
required for plant breeding in this poorly understood
genus. The focus will be on the characterization of the
nuclear and cytoplasmic gene pools. The entire chloro-
plast genome sequence will be sequenced, partial se-
quences of the mitochondrial genome will be generated
and chromosome number and ploidy variation recorded
for the nuclear genome.
We will use DNA sequencing and bioinformatics tech-
niques to assess the sequence information of the Mis-
canthus organelles. We will study their features via
annotated genome diagrams and via comparisons to
other grasses especially sugarcane, sorghum and maize.
Structural rearrangements will be recorded and assess-
ments made of the molecular evolution of their genes.
We will assess the cytoplasmic gene pools available for
breeding by developing and applying molecular mark-
ers (including but not exclusively SSR variants) suitable
for rapid screening of diversity. Furthermore we will use
ﬂow cytometry in conjunction with chromosome counts
to assess polyploid complexes. We will determine cross-
ability groups and gather essential information for fu-
ture ploidy manipulation.
This is a collaborative project between Teagasc Crops
Research Centre Oak Park in Carlow and the Botany
Department of Trinity College Dublin (TCD). The re-
searcher will be based in Oak Park but can spend some
research time at TCD. The student will receive an an-
nual tax free stipend of ???21,000 for maintenance and
to cover University fees (currently ???4,708 pa for EU
citizens, ???12,067 pa for non-EU citizens). The PhD
project is funded for three years and is expected to start
on 1st October 2007.
Applicants must have or expect to gain a ﬁrst or up-
per second class or Masters degree in an area of bio-
logical sciences. Informal enquires are welcomed and
further information is available from the co-supervisors
(below). Applications, including a covering letter de-
tailing research interests and aspirations, a detailed

PhD Position in Plant Population Ecology
Rationale: The European knapweed Centaurea macu-
losa, introduced from Central Europe (EU) into North
America (NA) during the late 19th century, where it
covers now an area larger than Switzerland, has become
a model for research on the ecological and evolutionary
causes and consequences of invasions. In recent studies
based on ﬁeld surveys covering well over 100 popula-
tions, we found both diploid (2x) and tetraploid (4x)
plants in EU, but so far only 4x in NA. The NA plants
are almost exclusively perennial and polycarpic, but the
most widely distributed ones in EU are the 2x that are
biennial and monocarpic. We presently explore the role
of rapid evolutionary processes in the invasion success
of C. maculosa, which involves both molecular marker
studies to clarify the introduction history, and quan-
titative genetic experiments, and try to elucidate the
complex taxonomic status of the various accessions.
Furthermore, we study preference, performance and
impact of both generalist and specialist insect her-
bivores (some of which have been introduced as bi-
ological control agents 30 years ago) on various C.
maculosa accessions in short-term greenhouse exper-
iments using potted plants. For further informa-
tion on the University and ongoing research on this
topic visit http:/www.unifr.ch/biol/ecology/ . This is
a project associated with the National Centre of Com-
petence in Research (NCCR) Plant Survival ( http:/-
/www2.unine.ch/nccr ), funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation.
We now seek a highly motivated person to initiate and
perform a three- year ﬁeld demography study on the im-June 1, 2007 EvolDir 19
pact of specialist insect herbivores on the C. maculosa
biotypes diﬀering in life cycle (monocarpic vs. poly-
carpic) and ploidy level. These studies are planned at
various sites in Europe, possibly also in NA, in collabo-
ration with colleagues from US (Ray Callaway and John
Maron, Corvallis, MT using joint ﬁeld sites and com-
plementary experiments) and from Australia (Yvonne
Buckley, Brisbane, for the modelling part) and will in-
volve stays at these sites. New ideas and complemen-
tary studies are of course highly invited.
Requirements
- Master Thesis in Biology - knowledge of, and/or expe-
rience in one or several of the following areas of research
is desirable: experimental ﬁeld ecology, demography,
plant populations ecology, modelling, insect-plant in-
teractions.
Salary and conditions The position is planned to be
ﬁlled in during summer/autumn 2007 and is available
for 3-4 years. Salary according to the guidelines of the
Swiss National Science Foundation (gross salary in the
ﬁrst year about CHF 34?200). The successful candi-
date will be enrolled in the NCCR doctoral school with
a large oﬀer of speciﬁc lectures and practicals.

MalariaComputerSimulation
PhD Studentship available
“Computer simulation of malaria transmission, drug re-
sistance and its impact on human heath” Liverpool
School of Tropical Medicine, http://www.liv.ac.uk/-
lstm/ Starting summer 2007.
Malaria kills an estimated 1 to 3 million people per
year and its transmission depends on the interaction of
three organisms: the malaria parasites, mosquitoes and
humans. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have
commissioned the Swiss Tropical Institute (STI) to pro-
duce a comprehensive computer simulation of malaria
transmission and its impact on human disease. The
programme will be made publicly available and will en-
able researchers to gauge the likely impact of public-
health strategies such as provision of bednets, spraying
houses to kill mosquitoes, deployment of vaccines and so
on. The programme uses distributing computing where
volunteers run components as screen-savers. This has
attracted considerable media interest from, among oth-
ers, Nature, the BBC and the Economist, see the fol-
lowing URLs for more details: Malariacontrol.net and
Africa-at-home.web.cern.ch
We are looking for someone to investigate how proposed
interventions to control malaria may simultaneously af-
fect the spread of drug resistant malaria; for example
will periodically treating all children with antimalarial
drugs pay a long-term penalty in driving drug resis-
tance? This component will be based at the Liverpool
School of Tropical Medicine and is oﬀered as a PhD
studentship.
Applicants need to have proven computing skills to ex-
tract and analyse the considerable amount of output
produced during the STI simulations; these track fac-
tors such as the frequency of severe malaria attacks,
number of infective bites per person, percentage of in-
fections that are drug resistant, and so on . The appli-
cant should also have an interest in the epidemiology ofinfectious disease although this is a secondary require-
ment and may be learnt in-post.
Essential skills: * Good/excellent programming skills
in C/C++ * Familiar with software development on
Linux OS Additional useful skills: * Mysql * Scripting
languages * XML
The applicant will probably have a background in quan-
titative biology, statistics or computer science. Unfor-
tunately, due to the PhD fee structure they must be
UK or EC citizens

UNamur EvolBiol
A six year Graduate position available at the
Department of Biology at the University of Na-
mur, Belgium ( <http://www.fundp.ac.be/ >http://-
www.fundp.ac.be/ ).
The graduate student has 6 years to accomplish his/her
PhD since he/she is expected to teach practical courses
too. The practical courses are in biology at the FUNDP,
approximately 250h a year, and should be given in
French.
The research project will investigate the population
genetic structure of a bdelloid species and the host-
parasite interactions within this unique group of organ-
isms.
Bdelloid rotifers are abundant free-living multicellular
animals, a few tenths of a millimetre long, characterized
by apical bands of cilia. The entire Class Bdelloidea ap-
pears to be without males or hermaphrodites and is the
highest-rank metazoan taxon to be obligately asexual.
Bdelloids have been remarkably successful, speciating
and adapting to many diﬀerent types of freshwater and
moist-terrestrial habitats like ponds, lakes, mosses, tree
barks and soil all over the world. This success has
come despite the fact that bdelloids inhabit microbial
pathogen-ﬁlled environments and lack sexual recombi-
nation, a mechanism necessary to generate variation in
response to rapidly evolving parasites. It is therefore
timely to explore the response of bdelloids to their nat-
ural and less speciﬁc pathogens and to investigate the
underlying genetic variation.
The speciﬁc aims of this project are:June 1, 2007 EvolDir 21
- investigate the clonal diversity within and between
bdelloid populations from the ﬁeld, since few studies
have been done on the population genetic structure of
those organisms
- investigate the response of bdelloid individuals in-
fected with the fungus Rotiferophthora and identify the
natural parasites of bdelloid rotifers
The work will be carried out with Dr. Karine VAN
DONINCK at the Department of Biology (URBO) at
the University of Namur (Belgium). The research will
be done in collaboration with Dr. Yannis Michalakis
(GEMI, IRD Montpellier, France), the group of Dr.
Timothy G. Barraclough (Imperial College London,
UK) and Dr. Africa Gomez (University of Hull, UK).
Applicants must have completed their undergraduate
studies, be motivated to do research in evolutionary bi-
ology and keen to teach.
Belgium is a very nice country to live in and the salaries
for PhD students are generous.
If you are interested, please contact Dr. Karine VAN
DONINCK at karine.vandoninck@mpl.ird.fr
To be eligible you have to submit the French applica-

PhD Opportunity: Evolutionary Origin of Medicinal
Properties in Plants
DNA sequence data have provided new and reliable
phylogenetic hypotheses for plants, but these new phy-
logenetic trees have yet to be related to the diversity
of medicinal plants. A recent analysis of the evolu-
tionary origin of economically important plants used
a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the ﬂora of the
Cape of South Africa and an inventory of useful plants,
and showed that utility is not randomly distributed but
instead clumped within particular lineages and loca-
tions1. Using this study as a proof of concept, we pro-
pose a project that will investigate the power of phylo-
genetic hypotheses to explain the origin and diversity
of medicinal plants at two levels of the taxonomic hi-
erarchy (for the angiosperms and for a selected fam-
ily), and with respect to ﬂoras for which databases of
plants with medicinal properties have been compiled
(Southern Africa, North America, and India). The
student will test the hypothesis that medicinal prop-
erties are constrained by the phylogeny and shed light
on the mechanisms underlying this pattern (including
the role of human traditions and an evaluation of the
constraints on chemical pathways for chemistries of in-
terest). The student will also test the hypothesis that
phylogeny-based conservation priorities are more eﬃ-
cient in preserving the diversity of medicinal plants in
a given location, region or country.

TITLE: TROPHIC CASCADES AND HERBIVORE
IMPACTS ON TUNDRA: FEEDBACKS ON BIODI-
VERSITY AND CLIMATE; INSTRUCTOR: LAURI
OKSANEN
Outlines of the project:
A lemming outbreak is coming on the mainland tundra
of northernmost Norway, allowing us to study whether
lemmings are dynamically in the role of predators of
plants or in the role of prey of carnivorous mammals
and birds. In this context, we will also study whether
the lemmings respond to high population densities by
“migrations” (long-range dispersal).
While the focus is ecological, the project has a clear
evolutionary dimension. If lemmings were regulated by
predationlike other microtien rodents, long range dis-
persal would be pointless and should not occur. If,
however, lemmings are adapted to harsh environements
where winter food is the limiting factor, emigration is
the only chance to escape starvation. Out hypothesis is
thus that those lemmings, which “jump the cliﬀ” (leave
crowded mountains) take their a chance; suicide is com-
mitted by those which chicken. As for plants, there has
been long standing argument that strong herbivirory
should select for low edibility. We doubt this. When
winter food runs out, herbivores are not especially se-
lective and can severely injure even maximally unpalat-
able plants, favoring resilience (e.g. graminoids). The
outbreak will enable us to test this hypothesis, too.
We know that woody plants are inedible for lemmings,
while graminoids are their delicassy. We will test the
inedibility h ypothesis by studying the response ow
graminoids and ericaceous dwarf shrubs to the out-
break.
As typical, the lemmings come on short notice. There-
fore, the current funding is improvised, suﬃcing forJune 1, 2007 EvolDir 23
8 months as a PhD project (PhD stipendium 1255
EUR/month) or for 6 months as a post doc project
(stipendium 1600 EUR/ mo). Grant proposals for
more sustained funding are pending, but lemmings do
not wait. The project will thus be started already
1st July this summer. A detailed project description
is found on my homepage ( http://users.utu.ﬁ/lauoks/-

The successful candidate is expected to start working

*PhD thesis in molecular evolution/evolutionary bioin-
formatics*
Mobile DNA is DNA that can change its position within
a genome. It is an integral component of most bacterial
genomes, and also implicated in the spreading of drug
resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria. Why does
mobile DNA persist in genomes? On one hand, mobile
DNA may be a very eﬀective parasite, replicating itself
at the expense of its host. On the other hand, mobile
DNA can also have beneﬁcial eﬀects, such as occasion-
ally beneﬁcial mutations. An ongoing project in our
group aims at resolving the question why mobile DNA
is maintained in bacterial genomes and in eukaryotic
genomes. Despite thirty years of debate, the question
still has no conclusive answer. The availability of many
completely sequenced genomes provides a unique op-
portunity to remedy this situation. We are searching
for a Ph.D. student with demonstrable experience and
interest in evolutionary biology and a solid background
in bioinformatics.
The Wagner lab at the University of Zurich studies
biological evolution on all levels of organization, from
genes, genomes, and genetic networks to whole organ-

Logan, UT 84322, USA
Description of research: The North American lesser
scaup (Aythya aﬃnis) population has been declining for
over 20 years, which has raised concern amongst man-
agers and the general public. Uncertainty about the
eﬀects of harvest-related mortality, recruitment, and
population density on lesser scaup population dynam-
ics make management extremely challenging. The cur-
rent harvest-management strategy assumes a particular
form of density-dependent population growth and ad-
ditive eﬀects of harvest on population abundance. One
objective of this position will be to develop a set of
alternative population models, such that management
decisions can be based on the population model(s) that
is(are) best supported by the data. The student will
have freedom in the development and examination of
relevant models. Factors that are of interest but have
yet to be explored in scaup population models that ex-
plicitly include harvest are: age structure, additive vs.
compensatory eﬀects of harvest on mortality, alterna-
tive forms of density dependence in demographic vitalrates, eﬀects of abiotic factors (e.g., climate) on demo-
graphic processes, etc.
In addition to the general Ph.D. education, the student
will be expected to learn about waterfowl survey data,
survival estimation, population models and Bayesian
statistics. Using appropriate methods, the student
will simultaneously incorporate multiple sources of data
(e.g., abundance, harvest surveys and wing collections,
capture-recovery data, etc.) into the estimation and de-
velopment of alternative population models. A comple-
mentary objective of this project will be to conduct sim-
ulation analyses to identify information requirements to
more objectively discriminate between alternative pop-
ulation models. The student will also be encouraged to
develop papers related to this work that might be of
broad interest to the population, conservation, statis-
tics, and adaptive management communities.

Wageningen LivestockDiseaseEvol
PhD project on pathogen transmission and bio-security
Job description
This research project aims to obtain a better under-
standing of the disease transmission during outbreaks
of highly transmissible diseases in livestock. Of par-
ticular interest is the transmission that occurs between
(more or less nearby) farms and that is taking place
despite the presence of animal movement restrictions
and other intervention measures. Some of the charac-
teristics of the dominant mechanisms are likely to be
universal across diﬀerent types of diseases, including
highly transmissible diseases such as avian inﬂuenza,
classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease, but
also other infectious diseases such as Campylobacter in
poultry and Inﬂuenza in pigs. The mechanisms will be
studied through a combination of transmission exper-
iments, parameter estimation and mathematical mod-
elling.
This research project is funded by the Ministry of Agri-
culture, Nature and Food Quality. The relevance to the
Ministry lies in its need to design well-founded interven-
tion strategies for combating epidemic spread of highly
transmissible diseases in livestock, including appropri-
ate hygiene and bio-security approaches.
This research will be carried out in Lelystad, the
Netherlands, at the Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiol-ogy cluster of the Division of Infectious Diseases of the
Animal Sciences Group (ASG), where experts both in
mathematical modelling and in conducting transmis-
sion experiments will provide guidance. The project
will be carried out under supervision of Prof. dr ir.
M.C.M. de Jong, head of the Quantitative Veterinary
Epidemiology group at Wageningen University, also
part of ASG.
Requirements
University Graduate
An MSc degree in Biology, Animal Science or Vet-

GroningenU ModellingTransgenes
PhD or Postdoc position “Modelling the spread of
transgenes”
University of Groningen, Centre for Ecological and Evo-
lutionary Studies
Context of the project: The introduction of transgenic
crops raises some important environmental safety is-
sues. One matter of concern is the question whether,
and to what extent, gene ﬂow involving transgenes sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀects the population ecology of wild rela-
tives. To assess the ecological implications of the ge-
netic modiﬁcation of¨ ycrops the Dutch Science Founda-
tion (NWO, www.nwo.nl ) launched the new research
initiative ’Ecology Regarding Gene-modiﬁed Organ-
isms’ (ERGO). In the context of ERGO, the research
programme “Introgression of crop (trans-)genes into
wild relatives: hybrid ﬁtness, background selection
and hitchhiking” is a joint eﬀort of research groups at
the University of Groningen, the University of Ams-
terdam and Wageningen University. This programme
comprises four integrated projects that combine an
experimental approach (focusing on the wild lettuce
species Lactuca serriola) with a theoretical modelling
approach. In addition to the theoretical project adver-
tised here, there are two open PhD positions for the
experimental projects.Job description: In the project “Modelling the ecolog-
ical implications of the spread from transgenic crops
into wild relatives” simulation models will be developed
for the spatial dispersal of transgenes (vegetatively or
through pollen or seeds) in wild populations. The main
objective is to predict the dispersal pattern and inva-
sion prospects of a transgene on the basis of the life
history of the plant species involved. The potential ef-
fect of¨ ytransgenes on dispersal characteristics will re-
ceive special attention. In a long-term perspective, the
projects aims at the development¨ yof general-purpose
predictive tools for scientists and decision-makers alike.
To achieve this goal, it is crucial to ﬁrst perform a
detailed analysis for speciﬁc well-studied model organ-
isms like L.serriola. This theoretical project will there-
fore strongly reﬂect progress in the three experimental
projects. The models resulting from the project will be
integrated and validated with existing data, in cluding
those generated for L. serriola.
Proﬁle: For this challenging, multidisciplinary project
we are looking for a highly motivated biologist (MSc
or equivalent) with a strong background in modelling,
population genetics and/or population biology. Experi-
ence with programming (preferably C++) is required.
Proﬁciency in English (both oral and written) and ex-
cellent communication skills are indispensible for this
integrative project. Although we are in the ﬁrst place
looking for a PhD student, qualiﬁed postdocs are also
invited to apply.
Organization: The position will be embedded in the
Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies (CEES,

Information about the Center and a complete position
description may be found at www.Bioinformatics.K-
State.edu <http://www.bioinformatics.k-state.edu/ >.
The K-State Bioinformatics Center is supported by the
Division of Biology and the Kansas Infrastructure Net-
work for Biomedical Research Excellence (KINBRE,
NIH-NCRR). The Center currently provides bioinfor-
matics support to K-State researchers for EST sequence
and microarray data analysis. GeneSpring software has
been used for microarray data normalization, statistical
inference and clustering analysis. With the anticipated
accumulation of microarray data from insect genomics,
a database system is needed for data management and
integration. For spotted cDNA microarrays, the in-
tegrated database can provide information about the
probe sequences and functional annotations, which may
not be available in the public databases. On the other
hand, the microarray data in the integrated database
should provide valuable information about the expres-
sion patterns of insect genes.
For the Tribolium research community, the center has
developed a comprehensive genome database (Beetle-
Base at http://www.bioinformatics.K-State.edu/-
BeetleBase/ ). BeetleBase was built using the Chado
generic data model designed by FlyBase and Berkeley
Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP). BeetleBase has
been populated with various types of data, ranging
from genomic sequences to mutant phenotypes of
Tribolium. A relatively large dataset of Tribolium
ESTs is also stored in BeetleBase. A web interface has
been developed to allow public access to the integrated
data in BeetleBase. In particular, the generic genome
browser (GBrowse) is used as one of the interactive
visualization tools of BeetleBase.
KSU is an equal opportunity employer and actively
seeks diversity among its employees.

AFLP run parameters 3730xl
Hi, I would be interested in ﬁnding out how other peo-
ple are running AFLPs on a 3730 genetic analyzer. We
are using the ROX size standard and are experienc-
ing loss of resolution with the larger fragments and a
“crunching” of the middle sized ladder fragments with
either of the two following sets of electrophoresis pa-
rameters: Dense patterns: 12 sec injection time, 15 kV
injection voltage, 30 min run time, 13 kV run voltage
Simple patterns: 5 sec injection time, 13 kV injection
voltage, 26 min run time, 15 kV run voltage
However, if we set the machine to the microsatellite pa-
rameters and run the plate a second time, the ladder
looks beautiful but none of the AFLP fragments makes
it through. Any advice would be much appreciated!

We are planning to purchase GeneMarker (from Soft-
Genetics) to score our AFLP proﬁles generated on
ABI 3100 capillary system (using LIZ size standard).
I would like to hear your experience with this soft-
ware and possibly also comparison with other similar
software. I would be particularly keen to hear about
GelQuest, STRand and Peak Scanner (as I have notused them before) or comparison with Genotyper (the
one I am most familiar with).
We have a large sample size (about 2000 samples and
9 primer combinations in 3 multiplexes) and are thus
looking for a high throughput software with automatic
processing, that would allow manual editing and would
be versatile and easy to use. We are limited by cost, so
not considering GeneMapper etc. I had previously also
tried Genographer, but encountered some problems.
Many thanks,
Sarka

AFLP scoring software answers
Dear EvolDir members,
I’ve got several request for a summary of answers to my
query regarding software for scoring AFLP. I received
positive comments on GeneMarker, which is very en-
couraging, but I haven’t heard much about most other
programs apart from Genographer - that seemed to
have mixed references. So please if you or your col-
leagues have experience with alternative AFLP scoring
software, I’d still be interested in hearing from you!
Best wishes, SarkaJune 1, 2007 EvolDir 43

RESPONSES I RECEIVED UP TO DATE (original
post at the end):
Just to let you know that I own a copy of GeneMarker,
and am very happy with it. I use it for data from an
ABI 3730, and prefer it to GeneMapper, which I have
also used, but refused to buy because of the cost. I’ve
heard that there’s a lite-version, free, of GeneMapper,
and once I ﬁnd the lead I’ll send it to you. If you’re
familiar with using this kind of software then Gene-
Marker is great. The manual assumes you’ve already
used something like GeneMapper. I like the ﬂexibility
in the software, and also the ability to create panels that
don’t require you to go through so many peaks each
time, once you’ve identiﬁed the informative markers in
a population, species, etc. I tried to use Genographer
and STRand, and got fed up, realizing that for high-
throughput work, they would really get on my nerves
after a while.

We have tried GeneMarker and found it an excellent
program - it is very powerful and user-friendly. We
routinely use GeneMapper and although GeneMarker
is more user-friendly, these two programs give broad
comparable results. Both GeneMarker and GeneMap-
per are fully automated (cf. Genographer). Also, I
don’t think Genographer supports the LIZ size stan-
dard.
SoftGenetics allow you to download either a limited-
function version, or a full-functional 30-day trial ver-
sion of GeneMarker ( http://www.softgenetics.com/-
downloads.html ).
We haven’t had much experience with other programs,
but you may ﬁnd Table 1 in the attached paper helpful
- it proﬁles most of the AFLP scoring software cur-
rently available. (Meudt, H.M. & Clarke, A.C. (2007)

tions, analyses and advances. Trends in Plant Science,
12. p106-117.)

I have experience working with both GeneMarker and
Genotyper for genotyping AFLP traces, and can report
that GeneMarker is a much better program. In fact,
I genotyped three primer combinations of about 300
samples with Genotyper and with GeneMarker. Geno-
typer is simply not set up for this kind of work, and
was generally cumbersome and diﬃcult to work with,
although I’ve been pleased with it before for genotypingmicrosatellite traces. GeneMarker is set up speciﬁcally
for AFLPs (but works well to genotype microsatellites
too), and the technical support is reasonably good. It
allows you to correct for peak saturation and pullup
between dyes, among other things, and does automatic
genotyping of AFLP peaks in a way that makes a lot
of sense to me, but is ﬂexible as well. It does some
things that are a little annoying, but may be corrected
in the most recent update. For example, it re-sorts the
marker table sometimes when you insert an allele (so
you have to sort the table so the samples are arranged
in order again, A1, A2, A3, etc.). It is also not possible
to edit the marker table until you export into diﬀerent
software, such as Word or Excel.

*****
I’ve never used GeneMarker, but just a few things to
mention.
1. Have you thought about using a 650 Rox ladder?
When I did my AFLPs using a 3100 ABI I found that
I had quite a few fragments as large as 450bp, so LIZ
wasn’t an adequate ladder for me.
2. If you’re cost limited, why not try BinThere? http:/-
/hcgs.unh.edu/protocol/aﬂp/AFLPbinthere.html It’s
free, downloadable software that I’ve heard is pretty
good at auto-binning (particularly attractive for a large
data set).
I ran my samples through Genotyper (to deﬁne the lad-
der) and then used Genographer - by far my favourite
software for analyzing my AFLP data. What type of
problems did you have with it?
Rachel
Genographer deﬁnitely will have size standard issues
unless you analyze the data with GeneScan ﬁrst - I’m
not exactly sure what it does, but I think it might cali-
brate the ladder.... when you’ve analyzed the ﬁles with
GeneScan the ﬁle itself is changed and then they should
work ﬁne in Genographer. I liked this software because
it created a virtual gel - made looking at many sam-
ples at the same time possible (plus another group of
neat features related to assessing peak height and exact
size). If you decide to give it another try I’m happy to
help you ﬁgure stuﬀ out.

AFLP training course
Dear All,
Does anyone know of any training courses/training
tools for AFLP technique, preferably within Europe?
In particular, I would like to learn how to analyse
data following fragment analysis (e.g. how best to
call peaks; how the AFLP markers you generate are
stored/organised; how sets of markers are used to geno-
type individuals from wild populations).
I am a PhD student developing AFLP markers for an
animal, with a view to genotype many individuals from
diﬀerent demes across at least 300 markers and use
these markers to construct a preliminary linkage map.
My samples are run on an ABI PRISM 3100 and visu-
alised using GeneMapper (4.0).
Any information about any training course/tools would
be most appreciated.
Many thanks,

Coalescent software answers
Dear EvolDir members,
thanks to all who responded to my request about soft-
ware for coalescence simulations. I have got many use-
ful answers and post them to the list. Most of you
suggested either using SimCoal / SimCoal2 or gener-
ating genealogies using MS and then and then using a
sequence simulation program, like SeqGen, to generate
sequences on those genealogies.
It seems that simulating selection together with com-
plex demographies under the coalescence is not yet pos-
sible and/or feasible.
One comprehensive reply listed a number of software
packages:MS http://home.uchicago.edu/ ˜ rhudson1/source/-

**
Can anybody suggest a software package for coales-
cence simulations under diﬀerent population demo-
graphic models (subdivision, stable population size,
bottlenecks) and diﬀerent background mutation rates?
Ideally there should also be a possibility to introduce
selection, diﬀerent mutation models, and Id prefer the
results (a random sample of sequences from the simu-
lated populations) to be available in .nex or some other
popular format.
Answers:
I do not now of any software that do all the
stuﬀ that you want would like to recommend
Hudsons MS http://home.uchicago.edu/ ˜ rhudson1/-
source/mksamples.html and if you want to in-
clude selection try SelSim http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/-
˜spencer/SelSim/Controlﬁle.html . At least ms is used
extensively and once you get started fairly easy to use.
** try SimCoal or SimCoal2 ( http://cmpg.unibe.ch/-
software/simcoal2/ )
** have a look at serialsimcoal
** Hi, you have a number of options. Proba-
bly the most eﬃcient neutral simulator would be
Richard Hudson’s ms ( http://home.uchicago.edu/-
~rhudson1/source/mksamples.html), the results of
which can be piped into Andrew Rambaut’s SeqGen
(http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/ software.html?name=Seq-
Gen) to generate sequences under varying mutation
models. For selection, have a look at Spencer &
Coop’s SelSim ( http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/˜spencer/-
SelSim/Controlﬁle.html ). All three are command line
unix-type programs which are easy to incorporate into
larger shell or perl scripts if necessary. Another option
for selection simulations would be HYPHY ( http://-June 1, 2007 EvolDir 45
www.hyphy.org/ ) which provides a framework for phy-
logenetic hypothesis testing. Selection can be simulated
along phylogenetic trees from predeﬁned roots under
given models. Again unix-style batch processing is pos-
sible.
** The most popular program for coalescent simulation
is ms (Hudson, Bioinformatics 2002). you can down-
load at http://home.uchicago.edu/ ˜ rhudson1/ Addi-
tionally, another programs have been constructed. I
designed a program named mlcoalsim (Evolutionary
Bioinformatics 2007) based on ms that construct sam-
ple sequences in fasta format and also calculates sev-
eral neutrality tests. you can download at http://-
www.ub.edu/softevol/mlcoalsim ** I have a program
which should allow you to do this (except for imple-
menting selection) at ueg.ulb.ac.be/treesSifter/

(1) DATA DEPOSITORIES * we are limited (by jour-
nal policies) in showing all our data, which could help
others doing simiilar projects or doing meta-analyses
* PMR suggested having people in the same discipline
brainstorm the best format for, for example, genotype
data * a possible “role model” data depository is NIH’s
DNA sequence depository, but our genotype depository
would have to be maintained probably by a nongov
agency (2) CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE * the
phrase “creative commons license” could appear after
your email email on the title page of your submitted
MS: this phrase means you not the journal own the
copyright; you could put your article as a pdf ﬁle on the
web for anyone to access free * Springer, Elsevier etc
make proﬁts from the front and back end: this phrase
would eliminate the back end (3) FOLLOW UPS if you
want these changes * google PMR for details and impli-

eMapper to GeneMarker because we are having some
problems with GeneMapper. We would appreciate any
comments on the pros and cons of GeneMarker. Would
you recommend GeneMarker? Or do you know about

Hi Sarah, I used the Qiagen kit for two 96-well plates
in a time. It works nice and it is very easy to follow
the instruction. The DNA was relatively clean. The
only down-side is that the yield is relatively low - I got
around 20-50 nano-gram/micro-liter in the ﬁnal solu-
tion. Cheers, Yuval
Hi Sara,
Yes, I have used 96-wells plates from Qiagen (DNA easy
96 Tissue kit) to extract genomic DNA. It has worked
ﬁne for me. Two remarks however: 1) you need to buy
a powerful and expensive centrifuge to use the kit. 2) I
ﬁnd the collection tubes (those in which you elute theextracted DNA at the end of the procedure) pretty bad.
They come in strips of 8 tubes, with the associated caps
attached to each other. This means that when you open
these tubes, it is easy to contaminate the samples with
one another.
Hope this helps.

Hi Sara I have used the promega sv96 wizard kit - it
has always given great results, even when all other ex-
traction methods have failed! You also need a vacuum
pump though.

hei,
i have used a kit for the 96 well DNA extraction for
plant materials 2-3 years ago. it worked very well
provided that you take great care to avoid of retro-
contamination among samples. This kit could be got
from QIAGen, which is very likely called DNeasy Kit.
it is for 6x96well preparation. but it costs a lot.
good luck!
jinyong
We perform chelex extractions in 96 well plates. It is
cheap, easy and fast and gives perfectly good DNA for
microsat ampliﬁcation.
Our protocol is below.
All the best, Andrew Pemberton
Making up the chelex suspension:
6% (w/v) ?solution? (really a suspension) in ddwa-
ter (Lukas? lab).1.5gchelex beads in 23.5ml ddwater.
Make up in autoclavable glass jar with lid and add
(clean) magnetic stirring ﬂea. Autoclave before ﬁrst
use and at intervals after that. Make up 2 or 3 bot-
tles at a time so have spares (perhaps of x1.5 the above
volumes). Use 150ul chelex for Scathophaga heads.50 EvolDir June 1, 2007
Protocol:
1. Aliquoting out the chelex suspension: Whilst stir-
ring on magnetic stirrer, pipette 150 ul chelex solution
into each well using a wide- ended P200 tip (either then
special white ?cell-saver? tips we have got or just cut
the end oﬀ a regular tip with scissors or a knife). This
is an inexact science as the number of beads you get
will vary. Try to get roughly the same by looking at
the pipette tip before dispensing.
2. Add the ﬂy head and crush on side of well or against
beads. Clean tweezers with bleach then deionised water
then 70% ethanol between ﬂies and have at least 3 sets
of tweezers so the get a few minutes in the bleach.
3. Seal the plate with a clean ABI rubber sealing mat.
Spin down with salad spinner. Using a PCR machine
with hot lid on (105C) incubate at 55C for 1hr

Leaf Preservation
Dear all,
I would like to ask for advice/suggestions about the
long-term preservation of leaf material in silica gel (for
molecular studies). We have quite abundant collections
from worldwide ﬁeld trips and wish to optimize their
storage conditions for long-term preservation while si-
multaneously keeping this material available (easy to
sample) for current research projects.
To our knowledge, no real data are available yet on this
topic, and we would like to know what the experience
of Evoldir members might suggest about: - Tempera-
ture of conservation: -20C, 4C, or room temperature?
-20C (or even -80C?) could appear the best solution,
but what about the condensation that will form on the
samples when taking them out of the freezer to remove
a piece of leaf? Are summer high temperatures (30-
35C) detrimental to DNA preservation? - Is light to be
strictly avoided for DNA preservation? - Bags, tubes,
boxes? Although tubes with screw-caps may be optimal
for DNA preservation, they are very space-consuming.
Therefore, we are rather thinking of using hermetically-
sealed bags (e.g. Minigrip). These bags should then
probably be placed in airtight plastic containers suchas Tupperware boxes.?? - Some people put the leaf
material into an individual bag only after the leaf is
dry. In this case, should we add silica gel in the bag?
Or would a small amount of silica gel in the box con-
taining several bags be enough?
In short, any suggestions on the long-term preservation
of dry leaf material for DNA studies would be greatly
appreciated! Thanks to all who could supply ideas.

ML DNA partitioning answers
Hello Evoldir.
Here are the replies to my request for programs that
could do ML phylogenetic reconstruction with DNA
data partitioning, such as when one has multiple genes
and wants to run by codon position by gene partitions
(as one can do in MrBayes).
exact response listed below.
My summary:
TREEFINDER ( www.treeﬁnder.de ) or RAxML
(http://icwww.epﬂ.ch/ ˜ stamatak/index-Dateien/-
Page443.htm ) or HyPhy www.hyphy.org thanks for
all the feedback and help,
chris
1) Hi, Chris. I’ve created such a program as part of my
PhD dissertation, which I’ll be completing this sum-
mer. The manuscript is in prep; I won’t distribute the
program until its approach has been peer-reviewed and
the paper is at least in press. Preliminary comparisons,
running the same non-partitioned models in PAUP and
in the new program, suggest that it can be up to 20
times faster than PAUP at ﬁnding the ML topology,
plus the program can run partitioned models, too (but
I haven’t evaluated its speed for that, yet).
One thing you could try in the interim (and assum-
ing that you don’t ﬁnd other programs which can al-
ready do partitioned ML quickly) is to do site-speciﬁc
rate models in PAUP. It won’t take into account diﬀer-
ent base frequencies or transition matrices across par-
titions, but will let you allow diﬀerent partitions to atJune 1, 2007 EvolDir 51
least have diﬀerent average rates. Also, ﬁve years ago,
it was announced that there would be a “bleeding-edge”
version of PAUP which would have new goodies such
as partitioned models: I haven’t heard anything about
this since then, but you could check with the develop-
ers.
2) To my knowledge, the only program (other than
codeml) that can do this currently is RAxML.
You can download it at: http://icwww.epﬂ.ch/-
˜ stamatak/index-Dateien/Page443.htm I believe that
Derrick Zwickl is also working on implement-
ing partitioned models in Garli, although I don’t
think it’s ready to go yet. You can check
for Garli updates at: http://www.zo.utexas.edu/-
faculty/antisense/garli/Garli.html 3) TREEFINDER
(www.treeﬁnder.de ) is a ML program that will ac-
cept multiple gene partitions along with diﬀerent
rate heterogeneity models. It will assume that
branch lengths are proportional between gene parti-
tions. RAxML ( http://icwww.epﬂ.ch/ ˜ stamatak/-
index-Dateien/Page443.htm ) is a very fast and eﬃcient
ML program that will allow for the existence of diﬀer-
ent GTR(Gamma or CAT) models in a multipartition
analysis. It estimates a single branch length across par-
titions. By the way, codeml is not designed for phylo-
genetic reconstruction.
4) Our open-source phylogenetic software package,
called HyPhy, is particularly well-suited for your prob-
lem. Please feel free to check it out at www.hyphy.org
5) If you are working with RNA genes, then try PHASE.

NeiLi GenetDistance software
Dear all,
I am looking for a software program available to calcu-
late Nei and Li’s (1979) genetic distance among popu-
lations for AFLP data. I do know that programs such
as PAUP and Phylip can calculate Nei and Li’s dis-
tance among individual samples, but I can’t ﬁnd any
tools to calculate it among populations. AFLPsurv and
GenAlEx are great programs for calculating population
distance based on Nei’s D, but they are not available
for Nei and Li’s.
I am wondering if anyone knows how to calculate pop-
ulation based Nei and Li’s distance. I appreciate it.

Nematode systematics
To those of you who have conducted biodiversity sur-
veys or ecological studies, particularly in terrestrial
biomes:
Could you please let me know if you have encountered
nematodes (esp. rhabditids) that you could not (easily)
identify, but which may have been an important part
of the ecological community you were studying. Would
your study have beneﬁtted by the availability of a good,
online, interactive key and database for rhabditid ne-
matodes?
(Rhabditids are tiny (0.5-4mm) roundworms that are
commonly found in many types of terrestrial (esp.
saprobic) environments and often associated phoreti-
cally or otherwise with other animals.)From our phylogenetic work, it is clear that there is a
need for the classiﬁcation system of these nematodes
to be completely revised, but we would also like to
get a general sense of the need/ demand for resources
and tools for identiﬁcation. Ideally, we would love to
hear about speciﬁc cases where such resources and tools
would have been useful.

SREL closing
The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory’s funding
from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will be
exhausted at the end of May 2007 and the lab will be
forced to close. The DOE or its equivalent has sup-
ported SREL for ecological research and environmental
education for 56 years.
During the past year, SREL has worked with Savannah
River Site (SRS) representatives to implement a new
5-year cooperative agreement with task-based funding,
similar to what has been used for the past 20+ years.
According to written and verbal communications from
DOE, the funds have been budgeted for SREL tasks
that have been underway since September 2006 and the
funds are actually at the SRS to complete these tasks,
however, the funds have not been released to SREL.
The decision to hold back funding from SREL is solely
due to oﬃcials at DOE Headquarters in Washington
DC who seem determined to cut oﬀ all DOE funding
for SREL regardless of the nature of the tasks proposed
and agreed upon with SRS managers.54 EvolDir June 1, 2007
SREL programs are more important than ever. Inde-
pendent environmental evaluation is critical for SRS
programs that will process new nuclear materials
brought to the SRS and current SRS processes that will
leave residual high-level waste in place forever. SREL
researchers are funded by many other agencies, but the
core mission of SREL remains independent environmen-
tal evaluation of SRS activities and long-term steward-
ship of the SRS. DOE Oﬃcials in Washington DC are
forcing the local SRS managers to discontinue funding
for an environmental program that has beneﬁted the
SRS, people of the Aiken-Augusta area, and the entire
country for more than half a century.
If DOE funding is not restored immediately, SREL will
be forced to close. All SREL animals will need to
be transferred or euthanized by the end of May. All
tasks that SRS managers have identiﬁed as important
to long-term environmental stewardship of the site will
not be completed. About 100 people will lose their
jobs, hundreds aﬃliated with or dependent upon SREL
research will be aﬀected signiﬁcantly, and tens of thou-
sands of teachers, students, and members of the public
who are touched by SREL education and outreach pro-
grams will lose out. SREL employees and programs
funded by non-DOE grants will also be forced to move
due to lack of funding to meet DOE mandated safety
and security requirements. Presentations to regional
schools, libraries, civic groups, and other organizations
will end in May, as will all funding for SREL student
programs on the SRS. The independent, oversight stud-
ies SREL conducts and publishes on radiation eﬀects,
chemical releases, and environmental health will also be
terminated at the end of May.
All citizens, including researchers, parents, teachers,
and children, who want to urge DOE to release the
funding for SREL to continue tasks agreed upon with
SRS managers should contact individuals who could
make this happen. The more people who express their
concern, the more likely it is that action will be taken.
You may contact the individuals listed below, write let-
ters to newspapers, or inform anyone else you think
should know. One suggestion is to write a short letter
that you can email, surface mail, and fax. Then make
a telephone call.

Sequence how many clones
Dear All
When cloning and identifying individual alleles of
mixed PCR products, a key question is how many
clones do I have to sequence to ensure that I have ap-
proached a good probability (eg 95%) that I have iden-
tiﬁed all diﬀerent copies. In the past when I have been
isolating two heterozygotic copies of a nuclear marker,
simply sequencing ﬁve colonies always identiﬁed the two
variants. But how many colonies would I have to se-
quence if there were 3, 4, 5, .... 20 etc...?
Does anyone out there know of a formula, or publica-
tion, that covers the above issue please?

year we plan to collect(or we will receivematerial) from
British populations. Silene nutans has a quite wide
continental distribution in Europe, so we would like to
extend your sampling area, especially to the east (and
to complete the northern distribution). Anyonewho

Software LAMARC 2 1
Announcing the release of LAMARC v2.1
We have just released a new version of the
LAMARC program, available at http://-
evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc/ for free down-
load.
LAMARC is a program which estimates population
parameters such as eﬀective population size, popula-
tion growth rate, migration rates among subpopula-
tions, and recombination rate. It performs Markov
chain Monte Carlo to search among possible genealogies
which can explain the observed data, and constructs an
estimate from these genealogies using either a Bayesian
or a maximum likelihood approach. It can use full DNA
or RNA sequence data, SNPs, microsatellites, or ele-
crophoretic data.
LAMARC is available as pre-compiled executables for56 EvolDir June 1, 2007
Windows, Mac OSX (PowerPC or Intel), and Linux,
and as source code which can be compiled on most sys-
tems.
Changes for version 2.1
Trait mapping. LAMARC can now be used to map
a phenotypic trait to a position in the sequence, if a
model of the relationship between trait phenotype and
genotype is available. This is a form of ﬁne-scale linkage
disequilibrium mapping. It may be useful in narrowing
down the position of an already-mapped genetic trait.
Multiple data types. Linked regions containing diverse
data (for example, a group of SNPs and an adjacent
microsatellite) can now be analyzed.
Linked data with diﬀerent mutation rates: Linked data
with known diﬀerences in mutation rate (for example,
introns and exons of the same gene) can now be ana-
lyzed more correctly.
Gamma-distributed rates among genomic regions. If
mutation rates are believed to vary among regions of
the genome, but the rate for each region is not known,
LAMARC can now model this as a collection of un-
known rates drawn from a gamma distribution. Doing
so both provides an estimate of the gamma shape pa-
rameter and provides more realistic conﬁdence intervals
for the the population size parameter. We expect this
to be particularly useful for large collections of unlinked
microsatellites.
GUI interface for ﬁle conversion. This release of
LAMARC features a greatly enhanced GUI interface
for converting ﬁles into LAMARC-readable input. For
users whose computers do not support windowing, we
also provide a batch version usable from the command
line.
TRACER compatibility. LAMARC now writes ﬁles
that can be read by the TRACER utility of Drummond
and Rambaut, which provides graphical and statistical
feedback on whether the parameter estimates have con-
verged.
If you have any questions about LAMARC or en-
counter diﬃculties in downloading it, please contact us
at lamarc@gs.washington.edu. We do not require reg-
istration to download LAMARC, but encourage you to
register so that you can receive updates and bug ﬁxes,
and so that we can document use of the program to our
granting agencies.

Software SciRoKo
Dear EvolDir members,
I am pleased to announce a new tool for whole genome
comparative genetics: SciRoKo 3.1 SciRoKo allows a
fast whole genome microsatellite search (H. sapiens in
600 sec on a common PC) and comparision of all iden-
tiﬁed microsatellites in fully sequenced species. Since
a total of 1.2 Mio SSRs (e.g.: H. sapiens) is some-
what diﬃcult to evaluate, SciRoKo provides statistical
analysisof the SSR-search results. For this similar mi-
crosatellite motifs are grouped into the same category
according to several considerations (eg.: trinucleotide
SSRs->trinculeotide category; AG, GA, TC, CT- >into
AG category etc etc). For each category SciRoKo
calculates the average length, the average number of
mismatches, average density (SSRs/Mbp) and average
standard deviation of the length. As a novelty SciRoKo
allows determining which microsatellite motifs can be
most frequently found in close proximity! SciRoKo
is platform independend and ships with a convenient
GUI (graphical user interface) SciRoKo is compatible
with many already existing SSR-search tools (Sputnik-
family), which SSR-search reports are accepted as inputJune 1, 2007 EvolDir 57

Which Mycena mtDNA loci
Hello ,
I would like to ask for a suggestion about
I am doing a phylogenetic study of the Mycena
(Prunulus) pura-complex. I have a relatively large sam-
ple of mostly European, but also North and South
American taxa fra the Calodontes group. I am mostly
interested in seeing 1) whether the Mycena pura-
complex can be properly subdivided with molecular
methods, and 2) if the Calodontes group (or rather,
our subsample thereof) is likely to be monophyletical.
I presently have about 600 ITS-sequences as well as 100
EFsequences (with, hopefully, some RPB1-sequences
yet to come), but I would like to supply with some se-
quences of a mitochondrial locus. I have been thinking
of sSU or MIP, but I have found little encouraging lit-
erature to support these thoughts. Does anybody have
a good suggestion?
Best regards,

Which loci
Dear all,
Thanks for the comments on my question posted last
week. In short I’m searching for low copy nuclear genes
to get a better resolution for my constructed topology.
One can ﬁnd the original question and some of the an-swers to this question below. Thanks to all that sup-
plied the cited suggestions bellow. If some of you still
have other options or things to try, please feel free to
let me know,
Best regards,
Philippe.
Original post:
Dear all,
I’m studying Opuntia (prickly pear) cacti in weakly di-
vergent species complex. I already sequenced some Trn
(chloroplast level) - and ITS - loci to construct a phy-
logeny. But because of the small amount of parsimony
informative sites I’m now thinking about adding one
or a few extra nuclear loci to get a better resolution.
Do some of you have some experience with this, or
have a nice idea about which nuclear loci to use, or
have other suggestions. Ideally these loci should have
some described conservative primers (for Cactaceae or
Caryophyllales).
Best regards and thanks in advance,
Philippe.
Answer from Bernard Pfeil:
Just a thought - check out the Silene (Caryophyllaceae)
work by Popp and Oxelman. They used introns from
rna polymerases and had nested primers, if I recall cor-
rectly (some conservative, others less so). But I’m not
sure I would agree that adding loci necessarily gives you
better resolution - that makes assumptions about com-
mon signal among loci, lack of hybridisation, lineages
sorting, etc.
Suggestion from Mark Chapman:
Dear Philippe,
Is there an EST database for a closely related species?
We used the lettuce and sunﬂower EST libraries to de-
sign a suite of markers usable across the Asteraceae
(paper in submission) and then used them to identify
the progenitor of saﬄower.
All the best
Suggestion by Taina M. Price
Philippe,
I saw your posting on evoldir, and I am working with a
very similar problem in Phemeranthus (Portulacaceae
sens. lat. or Montiaceae). I am doing phylogeny and
phylogeography but the species are weakly divergent
and there is very little informative variation in chloro-
plast regions, so I am looking for nuclear regions. One
region that I am having some success with, though the58 EvolDir June 1, 2007
data is very preliminary at this point, is the fourth
PepC intron, developed for Tamarix (Tamaricaceae,
Caryophyllales). The primers I’m using are PepC 4F
and 5R which you can ﬁnd in Lohmann 2006, Am. J.
Bot. 93: 304-318.
Thank you,
Taina M. Price

primers used and the variation he found when using
them.

Whole mitochondrial genomes
Dear EvolDir members, I have just started a project
about the whole mitochondrial genome of the decapod
Munidopsis polymorpha. I ampliﬁed a fragment for
the genes 12S,cytb,COI and ND5, and after I designed
species-speciﬁc primers for LONG PCR.
The problem is that I dont get ampliﬁcations with those
primers for the LONG PCR. I have high quality DNA,
but I dont know which is the order of the genes.
Thank you very much in advance.

mtDNA hypervariable regions
Dear all, I am currently trying to design primers to am-
plify the hypervariable region I (and possibly II) of hu-
man mtDNA. This is a small scale educational project
with a tight deadline, so thought I would ask if any-
body has primer sequences designed already that they
would be prepared to share with me. Ideally, I need
primers designed to conserved regions (i.e. so that they
will amplify the HVR of mtDNA from most/all human
samples) and that avoid the problem of ampliﬁcation
from gDNA.
Thank you in advance for your help, with best wishes,

mtDNA mutation rates
Dear Evoldir members
I am looking for any references that have compared the
mutation rates in diﬀerent mtDNA genes within thesame group of species. I am speciﬁcally interested in
comparing the rates for COI, 12S and 16S. The ma-
jority of references I have found just seem to give an
overall mutation rate.
Any help would be appreciated greatly

Postdoc: Evolution of plant gene regulation in Cologne,
Germany
A Postdoc position is available at the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany;
to join Juliette de Meaux’s lab, in the department of
Genetics and Plant Breeding.
Our research group is interested in evaluating the role
played by cis-regulatory DNA in adaptive evolution.
For this, we are studying the evolutionary dynamics of
functional non-coding regions within and among closely
related species of the Arabidopsis genus. Simultane-
ously, to relate this diversity to its ecological role in
natural environments, we are investigating the molec-
ular basis of adaptation in traits of great ecological
importance (seed dormancy, plant innate immunity).
The successful applicant will be encouraged to develop
his/her own research project within this framework. We
especially encourage evolutionary geneticists (including
evolutionary bioinformaticians) interested in transcrip-
tomics or population genetics of non-coding DNA to
apply. We are also very interested by molecular or evo-
lutionary biologists interested in characterizing molec-
ular functional variation of ecological relevance.
The Max Planck Institute oﬀers an outstanding en-
vironment for carrying out ambitious and innovative
research. Our research group exists since September
2005. It belongs to the Department of Genetics and
Plant Breeding, which brings together plant molecu-
lar biologists, quantitative geneticists and evolutionary
biologists to investigate the causes and consequences
of plant natural variation. The Institute beneﬁts from
a superb interdisciplinary scientiﬁc community, with
world class molecular biology being performed and ac-
tive contacts with outstanding evolutionary geneticists
located in the nearby University of Cologne.
Cologne, the metropolis on the Rhine, has just over
one million inhabitants and is the fourth-largest city in
Germany. It oﬀers plenty of cultural and recreational
activities. The city further beneﬁts from its centrallocation in the European travel network. Trains go di-
rectly from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt Interna-
tional Airport. Low cost air companies operate at the
local airport (K¨ oln-Bonn) and can take you anywhere
in Europe in a couple of hours.
Applicants are encouraged to consult the Insti-
tute/Departmental websites at http://www.mpiz-
koeln.mpg.de/english/research/koornneefGroup/-

begin on June 15th and continue until the position
is ﬁlled. Please provide a cover letter (detailing your
research achievements, goals and motivation for joining
our group) as well as a curriculum vitae and contact
information for three referees and submit to: Juliette
de Meaux <demeaux@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de >. We will
not review applications containing superﬁcial cover
letters. The position is funded by a fellowship of the
Max Planck Society for up to three years. Starting
date is October 1st 2007 or later. Don’t hesitate to

GenomeAnalysis
Open Post-Doc Position in Genome Analysis 10. May
2007
A Post-Doc position (1 year plus possible extension;
BAT IIa) is available for computational analyses of con-
served non-genic DNA sequences (CNGs). Of partic-
ular interest are content-based relationships between
CNGs and genic regions, which will be modelled by
methods coming from communication engineering and
information theory. Alternatively, a phylogenetic pro-
ﬁling approach together with a novel conservation score
will be used to test for functional relationships between
CNGs and genic regions. Candidates should have a
strong background in genome analysis, (i.e. database
queries, genome annotation, etc.), in genetics and po-
tentially in biological modelling and should be highly
motivated to broaden their methodological spectrum
by the interdisciplinary approach. If you are interested

This post doctoral position will be working with the
Ecological Genetics group in Auckland who are part
of the Biodiversity & Conservation science team. The
team consists of about 50 scientists and science tech-
nicians based in Auckland, Hamilton, Nelson, Lincoln
and Dunedin. Its mission is to undertake world class
scientiﬁc research to underpin the protection of New
Zealand’s biodiversity, and to minimise the impacts of
invasive weeds and invertebrates.
http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/research/biocons
The position is located in Auckland and you will be
applying genetic analysis to speciﬁc projects in plant
conservation genetics and provide evolutionary ecology
expertise for our program in environmental biosafety.
In particular, the position is aimed at determining
the relationship between genetic diversity and popu-
lation/species viability in threatened plant taxa. This
research programme you will be working in, aims todevelop a framework for identifying and conserving
genetic diversity in threatened indigenous plants in

risk of species extinction. This will be achieved by: *
Examining the relationship between genetic diversity
and key demographic and life-history factors that
inﬂuence population persistence * Determining the
level of relevant genetic variation necessary to main-
tain population viability * Generating management
guidelines that maximise the probability of population
viability and long-term evolutionary potential in plant
species with varied ecological attributes.
This project is part of a larger research programme on
sustaining and restoring biodiversity in New Zealand

join an NSF-funded international research team focus-
ing on the physiological, anatomical and genetic basis
of visual pigment spectral tuning in butterﬂies. But-
terﬂy visual pigments have evolved under positive se-
lection (See Frentiu et al. 2007, PNAS U.S.A. 104:
8634-8640) and undergone extensive spectral diversi-
ﬁcation following gene duplication (See Sison-Mangus
et al. 2006, JEB 209: 3079-3090). The spectral and
eye pattern variations are adaptations that reﬂect the
diversity of butterﬂy host plant usage and wing color
evolution. The successful candidate will have oppor-
tunities to engage in physiological (electroretinogram
recordings), transgenic (Drosophila), cell culture and
candidate gene approaches including mRNA and pro-
tein in situ studies to study the genetic basis of this
extraordinary evolutionary radiation.
Postdoctoral positions start at a salary of $37,548
per annum, plus beneﬁts. The successful candidate
will have a strong background in molecular and cel-
lular biology (e.g. PCR, cloning, sequencing, protein
biochemistry), neuroanatomical, and/or physiological
techniques (electroretinograms, microspectrophotome-
try). Excellent oral and verbal communication skills
are also required.

Postdoctoral Position in Modern Plant Taxonomy
Rationale: The European knapweed Centaurea macu-
losa, introduced from Central Europe (EU) into North
America (NA) during the late 19th century, where it
covers now an area larger than Switzerland, has become
a model for research on the ecological and evolution-
ary causes and consequences of invasions. We presently
explore the role of rapid evolutionary processes in the
invasion success of C. maculosa, which involves both
molecular marker studies to clarify the introduction his-
tory, and quantitative genetic experiments. Over the
past three years, we have collected seed material from
well over 100 populations from both the native EU and
introduced NA range and are presently growing most
of them in a common garden.
We seek a highly motivated person to help clarifying
the complex taxonomy, phylogeny and history of intro-
duction of C.maculosa, which may involve various sub-
species and hybrids, diﬀering in ploidy level. Part of
the task will be to link our molecular data, life- history
data and results from modelling and ﬁeld experiments
with the morphological characters yet to be collected
from our plant material. Finally, these ﬁndings need
to be confronted with published data and herbarium
specimen to come up with a more consolidated picture
of this taxon, its phylogeny and history of introduction
(e.g. single versus multiple events).
Requirements - doctoral degree in modern plant tax-
onomy or related disciplines; - knowledge of, and ex-
perience in one or several of the following areas of re-
search is highly desirable: complex multi-variate statis-
tics, nomenclature, phylogeny, biogeography, popula-
tion genetics, experimental ecology and evolutionary
biology
Salary and conditions Salary dependent on age and sta-
tus (gross salary in the ﬁrst year about CHF 70’000).
Start date: preferentially summer 07, autumn 07 the
latest. The position will also include support of research
activities of our group. The candidate will be located
at the University of Fribourg, but regular travel to the
University of Lausanne is expected. The position is for
1.5 years.
Applications Applicants should send their CV, includ-
ing the publication list, a short summary of research68 EvolDir June 1, 2007
experience and interests, and the names of two profes-
sional referees jointly to heinz.mueller@UNIFR.CH and

UIllinois BeeConsGenetics
Postdoctoral Research in Conservation Genetics– 2-yr
term
This posdoctoral research position is part of a multi-
team eﬀort to investigate causes of decline in several
species of North American bumble bees, among the Na-
tion’s most important wild and managed pollinators.
Reports of decline in range and abundance of several
species of North American bumble bees is cause for con-
cern as eﬀective pollination is critical for the health of
most terrestrial ecosystems and for agriculture.
The position is based at the University of Illinois and
will include extensive ﬁeldwork in both the midwestern
and western U.S. The research team comprises scien-
tists from UIUC, the USDA Bee Biology and System-
atics Laboratory (Logan, UT) and the Natural History
Museum, London. The principal goal of the research is
to determine whether population fragmentation, among
other potential causes, is leading to serious reduction in
genetic diversity in wild bumble bee populations. Ge-
netic diversity in declining species will be compared to
that of presumed healthy species to understand the role
that diversity may be playing in species population dy-
namics.
This research is part of a larger eﬀort to determine the
current status and causes of decline in bumble bees,
which includes surveys of current and past abundance
and distributions of targeted species as well as studies
of invasive pathogens.
We expect to hire someone with a PhD who has ex-
perience in the theory and methodology of popula-
tion genetics and phylogeography. The postdoc will be
expected to contribute evolutionary/conservation ge-June 1, 2007 EvolDir 69
netics expertise to the project, in collaboration with
other team members. Required expertise includes DNA
technology (extraction, ampliﬁcation, multiplex high
throughput sequencing and fragment-size analysis), de-
velopment of molecular markers (microsatellites, SNPs,
RFLPs), sibship analysis and population genetic esti-
mation, including eﬀective population size, genetic di-
versity, hierarchical genetic structure, evidence for in-
breeding and linkage disequilibrium. Expertise is ex-
pected in the use of relevant statistical software.
A background in molecular phylogenetics and statistics
along with experience in computer programming is also
highly desirable. Experience with nested clade analysis
of phylogeographic data is also important.
Additional interests should include an active interest
in invertebrate biodiversity and conservation, with rel-
evant publications in international journals.
The position is best suited to a person who has inde-
pendent initiative for problem-solving, is well organized
and works will with a team, and can work eﬀectively
under pressure. –

UQueensland EvolViralGenetics
Post doctoral Research FellowAn opportunity exists to work, as a Postdoctoral Re-
search Fellow, on a project funded by an Australian
Research Council Discovery grant. A motivated PhD
graduate is required to undertake original research
modelling the stochastic dynamics and evolutionary ge-
netics of virus populations.
The research will take place at the School of Physical
Sciences of The University of Queensland, which un-
dertakes a broad program of theoretical research, rang-
ing from astrophysics to bio-informatics research, in
conjunction with a strong biological sciences precinct.
This project will extend the School’s research scope to
include theoretical population genetics and population
dynamics. The project has a computational and quan-
titative focus, aided by close cooperation with biologists
and experts in computational bio-informatics.
Genetic complexity is at the heart of many problems in
theoretical biology. This type of exponential complex-
ity - which is found in many areas of science - often leads
to intractable computational issues. However, recently
developed stochastic gauge techniques for phase-space
representations provide powerful approaches to solving
these problems. These have greatly extended the work
of 2005 Nobel laureate Roy Glauber, into ﬁelds well be-
yond the original applications to quantum optics. They
are potentially relevant to the grand challenge problems
of evolution, adaptation and speciation. This project
is an interdisciplinary application of these novel tech-
niques to genetics.
Speciﬁcally the successful candidate will focus on the
highly relevant case of modeling viral evolution in a sin-
gle infected host using recent computational techniques
developed for quantum physics. Familiarity with high-
level computer languages would be useful, as would a
knowledge of modern population genetics or the use of
stochastic diﬀerential equations for modeling physical
systems.
You should possess a PhD in an area of theoretical
population genetics, mathematics, quantum statistical
physics or bioinformatics/computational biology, and
should have authored articles in international peer-
reviewed journals.
This is a ﬁxed term (one year with possible on year ex-
tension), full-time appointment at Academic Level A.
Applications close on July 1st, 2007.

YaleU ButterﬂyEvoDevo
Postdoctoral Position in Butterﬂy or Moth Evo-Devo
at Yale
I am looking for a postdoctoral candidate that has in-
terest in pursuing functional genetic work on Bicyclus
anynana butterﬂies and/ or in other butterﬂy or moth
species.
We have developed a new set of plasmid constructs
that once inserted into the germ-line can either ectopi-
cally express candidate genes or knock them down using
transgenic RNAi approaches. We have been obtaining
signiﬁcant eﬀects on the B. anynana adult wing pat-
tern by ectopically expressing B. anynana Distal-less
or Drosophila spalt either throughout the whole body
(via a whole body heat-shock) or via a laser-mediated
local heat-shock applied to the pupal wing. The genes
that still need to be tested, and for which we have made
both ectopic expression and RNAi constructs, include
decapentaplegic, wingless, engrailed, and spalt (RNAi).
This project will provide someone with an opportunity
to learn about transgenic techniques in Lepidoptera, as
well as wing color pattern evo-devo and functional ge-
netics.
The position is funded for two years ($37,000/year)
with the possibility of renewal contingent on additional
external funding. If candidates are interested in pur-
suing functional genetic techniques in butterﬂy/moth
species of their choice then the candidate will be sup-ported for a year but will be asked to apply for own
external funding during that year. In this case, ad-
ditional funding after the ﬁrst year may be contingent
on promising successful germ-line transformation of the
novel species.
Experience with molecular biology techniques such as
PCR, real-time PCR, Southern-blotting is desired. Ex-
perience with Immunohistochemistry is desired but not
essential.

Europe ConsGenetics proposals
The ConGen program, funded by the European Science
Foundation ( www.esf.org ) is calling for applications for
the organization of Winter- or Summer-Schools to be
held in late 2007 or in 2008. The School’s aim is to
provide the opportunity for younger researchers to meet
for discussions on the most recent developments in their
ﬁelds of research within conservation genetics. The
School, which usually last 5 days, should have a wide
participation from across Europe and involve young, in-
dependent researchers and scholars with leadership po-
tential. The relatively small scale (in terms of people
involved which should be around 25 to 30 persons) pro-
vides an ideal platform for focus on the topic and for
all participants to contribute to discussions and plan
follow-up collaborative work. The ConGen programme
invites applications for Winter/Summer Schools within
the ﬁeld of Conservation Genetics with special empha-
sis on the use of the application of genetic tools and
genetic softwares; interdisciplinary topics are greatly
encouraged. More speciﬁc guidelines on the main aims
of the Summer-(Winter-) School and of the suggested
structure of the course are given below: The eﬀects
of environmental stressors on ecosystems are complex,
and tools that improve our understanding are neces-
sary. Until now, eﬀorts have been mainly ecologically
based with little practice of incorporating genetic diver-
sity measurements into risk assessment. However, with
the use of genetic approaches the information level re-
turned is potentially much higher. The precise genetic
consequences of population perturbations result from
a complex balance among eﬀects on population sub-
structure, size, and founding events. Hence, there is a
need for tools that will support the interpretation of
genetic erosion eﬀects and selective eﬀects in investiga-
tions aimed to detect such events.
The course should provide an introductory overview of
the most essential methods commonly used in Con-
servation Genetics and of the most essential genetic
methods commonly used for the detection of environ-
mental perturbations, focusing on the joint application
of neutral and non-neutral genetic markers and demo-
graphic techniques. The course should be structured
with morning lectures and afternoon exercises in whichthe researcher will be given datasets to analyse and
will have an opportunity to analyse (their own) data.
Rather than provide comprehensive coverage of any sin-
gle technique, the course aims to teach young researcher
how to identify the most appropriate technique(s) for
speciﬁc types of data sets, and for speciﬁc questions.
Guidance should be provided to assist researchers in
ﬁnding references and software to address speciﬁc prob-
lems.

plications, please read the web page: www.congen . biz

Dear evoldir members, A ESF ConGen ( http://-
www.esf.org/congen/ ) funded workshop entitled “Pop-
ulation genetics modelling and habitat fragmentation:
separating recent and ancient events for eﬃcient con-
servation” will be held at the Instituto Gulbenkian
de Ciˆ encias in Oeiras ( http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ )
from the 19 to 21 Sept 2007.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together special-
ists from diﬀerent areas related either to conservation
biology and population genetics, including statistical
modelling. We shall discuss the current needs of con-
servation biologists in connection with the achievements
and limitations of current population genetics methods.
Discussions will revolve around case studies, and ongo-June 1, 2007 EvolDir 75

species. One aim is to show conservation biologists the
existence of tools that can be applied to infer the past
of endangered species and that this knowledge can be
used to improve conservation strategies. Another aim
is to show theoreticians that interesting inference prob-
lems still need to be addressed in conservation biology.
Case studies, theoretical work and software related pre-
sentations will all be represented during the workshop.
Current invited speakers are (in alphabetical order):
D. Balding, M. Beaumont C. Bessa-Gomes, B. Crouau-
Roy M. Currat, L. Excoﬃer P. Garnier-G´ er´ e, B.
Goossens D. Hudson, C. Lavigne R. Nielsen, U. Rade-

The Workshop aims at favouring discussion between
participants and is thus open to up to 25 participants
in addition to the invitees mentioned above. Local costs
(meals and lodging close to the Instituto Gulbenkian de
Ciˆ encias) will be taken care of for *all 25* participants.
Moreover, a limited number of grants will be given to
participants to reimburse partly ﬂight tickets.
The selection of participants will be based on scientiﬁc
criteria and on the need to maintain a balance between
theoretical and case studies. Participants coming from
ConGen contributing countries will be favoured in the
selection process (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Re-

We are pleased to announce that additional speakers
are now conﬁrmed for the workshop, and that the sub-
mission deadline for papers and abstracts has been ex-
tended until July 2nd 2007. This workshop oﬀers an
opportunity to be bold and creative, and to discuss ex-
citing new questions in evolutionary theory in a stimu-
lating environment.
This workshop will explore the formation of new lev-
els of selection and inheritance, the origin of the ﬁrst
evolutionary units and novel modes of natural selec-
tion. Recent work in a variety of ﬁelds has presented a
challenge to standard gene-centric evolutionary theory.
Higher-level and non-genetic sources of heredity have
been discovered. Artiﬁcial selection experiments have
demonstrated a response to selection of whole microbial
ecosystems, with concomitant implications for the for-
mation of new evolutionary units. These results bear
important relation to long-standing questions regarding
the formation of new levels of biological organisation.
The debate over levels of selection has an extended his-
tory. However, given recent empirical results and out-
standing unresolved issues, it again seems pertinent to
ask: What can selection act on? What sources of her-
itable variation exist? How can selection bring about
new units of selection? And how can artiﬁcial life mod-
els help to answer such questions?
Areas of interest:
Major transitions in evolution, formation of new
units of selection and/or levels of inheritance, non-
genetic heredity/epigenetics, evolution of co-operation,
ecosystem selection, multi-level selection theory, niche
construction and extended heredity, origins of life,
homeostasis and heredity/levels of homeostasis, self-

COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AN INTENSIVE TRAINING COURSE IN A
RAPIDLY EVOLVING FIELD
5-11 August 2007 - Alpine Lyceum Disentis, Switzer-
land
See: http://www.biosym.unizh.ch/index.php Oﬀered
by the BioSym and SIMOLIFE Teams of the Universi-
ties of Z¨ urich and Winterthur and the ETH Z¨ urich
Participants:
Students and researchers at the graduate, postgraduate
and professional level - maximum 25 and minimum 15
participants.
Stipends:
The course is supported by a grant from the Swiss Vir-
tual Campus, and a number of stipends are thus avail-
able for students who would not otherwise be able to
pay the course fee. The awards will partially cover tu-
ition, room and board, but not travel.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
The purpose of the course is to provide an overview of
the many facets of the exciting ﬁeld of computational
biology by bringing together various aspects of a num-
ber of biological and mathematical sciences. It is pri-
marily a skills course. Participants will develop math-
ematical models to solve biological questions. Since a
major goal of the course is to initiate contacts between
workers in scientiﬁc ﬁelds which are not usually com-
bined, it encourages a rapprochement between various
areas of biology, biochemistry, biophysics and mathe-
matics and treats them with an interdisciplinary out-
look.
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Over a period of six days the participants will be ex-
posed to an in-depth treatment of how biological pro-
cesses can be described in mathematical terms and howbiological concepts can be translated into mathemati-
cal models. We will employ Matlab-Simulink and other
software tools.
This year’s course will focus on eigth main themes
which are most central to the discipline of computa-
tional biology:
* Growth * Bioﬁlm formation * Epidemics * Virulence
and pathogenicity * Ecology and evolution * Human
physiological processes * Pharmacokinetics * Antibiotic
resistance

ESF sponsored exploratory workshop on
Ecological genetics: understanding the functional con-
sequences of natural variation in adaptation
Vienna 15.-16.9. 2007 Note: this is immediately after
the European Drosophila Research Conference ( http:/-
/www.imp.ac.at/EDRC2007/ )
Synopsis
It is well established that natural populations harbor
huge amounts of molecular variation. The neutral the-
ory of molecular evolution suggested that the eﬀect of
most of mutations is so small that they can be con-
sidered as neutral. Recent evidence, however, demon-
strated that a large proportion of natural variation
seems to be involved in adaptation to the environment.
Population genetics has developed powerful tools to
identify genes under selection, but the functional vali-
dation of such ecologically important variants requires
new functional approaches suitable to measure eﬀects
that are important in the wild, but diﬃcult to score inthe laboratory. Conversely, there is increasing evidence
that natural variation in structural or regulatory genes
have major eﬀects, which were only recognized through
the comparison of diﬀerent naturally occurring variants.
This workshop provides a platform for both functional
biologists and population geneticists with the aim to
develop concepts and new tools to study the functional
consequences of natural variation, in particular in the
context of ecology.
The invited speakers cover a broad range of topics and
approaches, ranging from theoretical population genet-
ics and quantitative genetics to developmental biology.
The impact of environmental and genetic variation on
phenotypic traits will be covered. It will be discussed
how the knowledge of well-studied model organisms,
such as D. melanogaster, yeast and A. thaliana, can be
extended to less studied organisms.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a80 EvolDir June 1, 2007
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
