Symposium on “The Origin of Novel Features”, Octo-
ber 6-8, 2006
The graduate student aﬃliates of the Indiana Univer-
sity / University of Oregon IGERT in Evolution, De-4 EvolDir August 1, 2006
velopment and Genomics would like to extend an in-
vitation to attend our upcoming symposium entitled
“The Origin of Novel Features” on October 6-8, 2006
on the IU campus in Bloomington, IN. This topic has
been chosen because it lies at the heart of evolution
of development (evo-devo) today. While much of evo-
devo has traditionally focused on deep connections in
macro-evolution, more micro-evolutionary perspectives
and approaches are now entering the ﬁeld. This makes
it possible to ask the diﬃcult and exciting question–
how do qualitatively new features arise in evolution?
We have assembled an interdisciplinary group of speak-
ers conducting important research towards this aim.
These speakers represent a diversity of ideas and organ-
isms (from dung beetles to humans) and utilize multi-
ple methodologies (from molecular biology to eco-devo).
More information about this symposium, including a
detailed schedule, list of speakers, and information on
accommodations and poster submission, is available at
our website:
http://www.bio.indiana.edu:16080/events/igert/ The
registration deadline is August 11. If you have any

First Conference Announcement - Save These Dates!
Convergence of Genomics and the Land Grant Mission:
Emerging Trends in the Application of Genomics in
Agricultural Research
Purdue University, West Lafayette, IndianaSeptember 10-12, 2007
You are invited to participate in a national conference
on agricultural genomics at Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Indiana on September 10-12, 2007.
The conference will feature invited presentations by rec-
ognized leaders in agricultural genomics and submit-
ted posters from interested participants. Presentations
on microbes, arthropods, plants, animals and ecological
systems will be integrated into sessions addressing the
following themes:
* Transition from Model to Agricultural Species * Inte-
grating Information Across Databases * Translational
Challenges and Successes * Roundtable Discussion and
Recommendations
This meeting promises to be a rare opportunity to ex-
change scientiﬁc expertise and experiences among ge-
nomics researchers and stimulate new discussions with
applied researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers
who do not normally interact with the genomics com-
munity. The goal of the conference is to promote syn-
ergisms across disciplines, commodities, and species. A
committee of recognized national leaders in molecular
biology and genomics is helping develop the program.
A ﬁnal list of topics and speakers is expected by
September 2006, when the second announcement about
the conference will be circulated and registration will
open. To learn more about the program, the organiz-
ing committee and other meeting logistics, go to the

Dear Colleagues,
Stony Brook University’s Departments of Philosophy
and of Ecology & Evolution will host an informal sym-
posium on the relationship between science and philos-
ophy, on Saturday, March 10, 2007 on the SBU campus
in Stony Brook, Long Island, NY.
The idea is to explore why, if at all, scientists should
care about what philosophers say about science. Is phi-
losophy of science a discipline that should matter, how-
ever tangentially, to practicing scientists? Is it an in-
dependent area of study largely independent of science6 EvolDir August 1, 2006
proper? What are the various domains of scholarship
and teaching of the two disciplines, and how should
they intersect?
We encourage colleagues and graduate students in both
philosophy and any area of science to submit abstracts
for the conference, on the general theme of whether or
not philosophy can be useful to science or vice versa,
and how one would go about building bridges between
the two cultures. Selected papers will be collected in a
special issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology, a very
high-impact journal dedicated to broad conceptual is-
sues in biology.
Abstracts should be around 200-300 words, and
should be sent to massimo.pigliucci@stonybrook.edu by
November 30, 2006. Authors whose abstracts will be
accepted will be asked to present for about 20 minutes,
with 10 minutes of Q&A after each presentation.

tion, massimo.pigliucci@stonybrook.edu)

Evolutionary Change in Human-altered Environments
An International Summit
February 8-10, 2007 Institute of the Environment Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles
Organized by Thomas Smith and Louis Bernatchez.
Human activities are aﬀecting the evolutionary pro-
cesses that generate and maintain biodiversity. Climate
change and deforestation are facilitating the evolution-
ary jump of animal diseases to humans. Fish farming
has resulted in the spread of poorly adaptive genes to
the wild. Introductions of exotic species are impacting
native species and limiting their ability to adapt.
In response to this developing crisis, we are convening
an international summit of evolutionary biologists, con-
servation practitioners, and policy makers to synthesizecurrent knowledge and to begin to develop plans to mit-
igate the eﬀects. The summit will feature talks from
more than 40 leading evolutionary biologists, poster
presentations, and working groups. A central goal of
the summit is to bring the discussion beyond academic
boundaries to frame real-world solutions to these prob-
lems. For more information and to submit an abstract
for a poster go to:
http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/ctr/ioesymposium.html The
deadline for poster abstracts is November 1, 2007.

Dear Colleague,
On behalf of the organizing committee for the 8th In-
ternational Feline Retrovirus Research Symposium to
be held in Washington DC October 8-11, 2006, I am
pleased to invite you to and members of your group to
submit abstracts of your latest work. The conference
promises to be an innovative and exciting blend of cat
genomics, retroviral research and advances in the cat
as a model of infectious disease.
Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by the Scientiﬁc
Committee and assigned to platform or poster presen-
tations (your preference would be helpful) and the best
of these would receive partial or full ﬁnancial support
for attendance. A signiﬁcant amount of the budget will
be allocated for this, so we really would encourage ab-
stract submission.
This is an exciting time for feline infectious disease re-
search and also feline genomics. The 2006 completion of
the complete cat genome sequence holds great promise
for expanding the role of the cat as a model of infectious
disease. We anticipate a unique blend of talks at the
conference and your participation would be a wonderful
contribution.
Please visit the conference website at http://-
ifrrs8.ncifcrf.gov for additional information, submission
of abstracts, and registration. Please note the deadline
for abstracts is July 15, 2006 and an early registration
discount deadline is June 1, 2006. Please feel free toAugust 1, 2006 EvolDir 7

speciation and hybridisation in Rhododendron.
The research project aims to investigate how inter-
fertile Rhododendron species co-exist. Genetic bar-
riers to gene ﬂow between species appear to be al-
most non-existent within Rhododendron, yet despite
this the genus has radiated dramatically within the
Sino-Himalaya region, with the genus Hymenanthescontaining well over 200 species in this region alone.
An understanding of how species barriers are main-
tained among Sino-Himalayan members of Hymenan-
thes will be highly instructive not only about how ex-
isting species maintain their integrity in the face of
hybridization, but also into how species barriers are
formed in the ﬁrst place, i.e. the process of speciation.
The research will involve ﬁeld work in China as well
as morphological, molecular and biochemical investiga-
tion. Candidates with a strong interest in ﬁeld botany,
taxonomy and plant evolution are particularly encour-
aged to apply.
RBGE has rich living and herbarium collections of
Rhododendron, and provides an extensive botanical li-
brary, molecular and microscopy laboratories for re-
search. RBGE has a strong research and teaching
ethos with about 20 PhD students and hosts the joint
RBGE/UoE MSc course on Taxonomy and Biodiver-
sity of Plants. Laboratories and other facilities are also
available at UoE.
Funding is available for three years and we hope to
appoint by October 2006. The closing date for applica-
tions is 12 August 2006, and interviews are scheduled
for 22 August 2006. Full funding is available only for
UK or EU students.
Letters of application, together with a full CV and the

LiverpoolU SexualSelection
PhD Position
Oxidative stress and sexual selection in mammals
Supervised by: Professor Jane Hurst, Dr Paula Stock-ley, University of Liverpool
Starting October 2006. Funded by BBSRC for 4 years
(UK-only funding)
Animals have evolved antioxidant defence systems that
play an essential role in minimizing the cellular dam-
age that results from interaction between cellular con-
stituents and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since
healthy life expectancy, fertility and reproductive suc-
cess depend on the eﬀectiveness of these defence sys-
tems, sexual selection is likely to lead to signals that
reliably reveal any diﬀerences between males in the abil-
ity to resist oxidative stress. In support of this, a num-
ber of recent high-proﬁle studies have linked colourful
sexual signals displayed by many birds and ﬁsh to an-
tioxidant defence and health. In mammals, scent is a
far more important mode of communication than visual
displays, and the project will investigate links between
oxidative stress and sexual selection for the ﬁrst time
in this important group. The project will build on our
established strengths in chemical communication and
sexual selection and develop a formal collaborative link
with Professor Malcolm Jackson, an expert on oxidative
stress at Liverpool University’s School of Clinical Sci-
ence. We will examine the eﬀects of deﬁciencies in an-
tioxidant defence systems and ageing on signal quality
and display, and the consequences for fertility and re-
productive success. This cross-disciplinary project will
provide speciﬁc training in evolutionary theory under-
lying sexual selection, the design and implementation
of rigorous controlled behavioural assays, assessment
of ejaculate quality, molecular analyses and pathology,
as well as generic research skills in experimental design,
statistical analysis, ethics and best practice in 3Rs, and
scientiﬁc communication.
Applicants should have a First Class Honours or an Up-
per Second Class Honours degree in a relevant biologi-
cal discipline, and a strong interest in evolutionary biol-
ogy. You will join an active research environment in the
Mammalian Behaviour and Evolution Group, based at
the University of Liverpool’s Veterinary Field Station,
on the Wirral Peninsula ( http://www.liv.ac.uk/mbe/-

University of North Florida. A graduate research as-
sistant (M.S.) is available. Starting date could be any-
time between September 2006 and August 2007 (prefer
January 2007). This research involves studying a basic
question in life history biology, namely the eﬀects of
the ovary on aging, independent of nutrition. The re-
production vs. longevity trade-oﬀ is well documented
in many organisms, but whether reproduction eﬀects
aging by nutrient allocation (e.g., stealing calories from
somatic maintenance) or direct eﬀects (e.g., releasing
factors that stimulate aging) is unknown. We aim to
test this question using a grasshopper model system.
Experiments will include testing the eﬀects of ovariec-
tomy on expression of stress proteins (Hsp70) and anti-
oxidation enzymes (superoxide dismutase). An under-
graduate degree in biology or a related discipline and
interest in working with insects are required. Strong

PhD position in Behavioural Ecology
Vacancy number: 1.2006.00141
The department of Animal Ecology, within the Faculty
of Earth and Life Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amster-
dam, The Netherlands has a PhD position vacant for
the project:
“Quantifying sexual conﬂict in a simultaneous
hermaphrodite”.
The goal of the project is to investigate the details of
sexual conﬂict in simultaneous hermaphrodites at dif-
ferent biological levels, using the pond snail (Lymnaea
stagnalis) as a model system. Within our integrative
approach, the focus will lie on experiments designed to
quantify the investment in the diﬀerent components of
male reproduction. At the same time, the aim will be to
uncover which male component induces the previously-demonstrated changes in the recipient, and whether
and/or how these imposed costs can be avoided. The
project is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for
Scientiﬁc Research and may start very shortly.
Tasks - Executing scientiﬁc research as detailed in the
project description. - Publication of results of the re-
search in scientiﬁc journals as well as in a thesis. -
Assisting in undergraduate courses given within the In-
stitute of Ecological Science. - Following the PhD edu-
cational programme as prescribed by the institute.
Required skills and education - MSc degree in Biology.
- Advanced courses in behaviour, animal physiology,
ecology, evolution or equivalent are desirable. - Proﬁ-
ciency in both written and spoken English. - Excellent
social skills, ability to work independently and high mo-
tivation will be assets.
Details The appointment will initially be for 12 months.
After a successful evaluation the contract will be pro-
longed with 36 months. The employment will have to
result in a written thesis. Our fringe beneﬁts of employ-
ment can be found at www.vu.nl/vacatures . Salary
Gross monthly salary, based on experience, amounts to
1.933,- Euro during the ﬁrst year up to 2.472,- Euro
during the last year.

URennes FieldAssist
Field assistants wanted
for a project examining the factors aﬀecting insect di-
versity in oak tree canopies in France.
Arthropods in the canopy represent one of the most
diverse, widespread and least studied communities in
temperate regions. In the present project we will study
the role of atmospheric stress (desiccation, NH3 emis-
sions) and island biogeographic processes (colonization,August 1, 2006 EvolDir 23
extinction) on arthropod biodiversity. We thus envis-
age the canopy as an archipelago of tree crown islands
in a sea of air. We will study diversity at the species
level, but also at a historical, i.e. phylogenetic level.
We will also explore the consequences of arthropod di-
versity for their functional role, particularly as grazers
and dispersers of cryptogams. Principle investigators
are Richard Bailey and Andreas Prinzing, University
of Rennes 1.
The ﬁeldwork will be in the Forˆ et de Rennes,
a large mixed deciduous and evergreen for-
est just outside the city of Rennes; the cap-
ital of the region of Bretagne (Brittany),
north-west France; see http://www.rennes.fr/-
; http://www.region-bretagne.fr/CRB/-
Public/rubriques thematique/visiter labretagne/-
labretagne unereg/la bretagne enimage/ .)
We are looking for people who are available in particu-
lar between mid August and the end of October 2006,
and will give preference to anyone who can stay for a
signiﬁcant length of time during that period.
The work would be particularly beneﬁcial for biology
students or recent graduates who wish to gain experi-
ence in entomological ﬁeldwork and more generally in
biodiversity measurement and research. Some knowl-
edge of insect identiﬁcation, and of tree climbing, would
be useful but is not essential as training will be given
where necessary. Some ability to speak French would
also be useful, but again is not essential.
There are no salaries associated with the positions.
However, food, accommodation costs and cheap ﬂights
to Dinard airport (Ryanair ﬂy to Dinard from East
Midlands and London Stansted in England) will be
paid. Besides the valuable ﬁeld experience to be gained,
we are able to oﬀer advice on manuscript preparation,
statistics, careers in research in France, and training
in French, if such things would be useful, and may of-
fer co-authorship to someone willing to stay for a long
period.
Anyone interested please contact me on

be available.A tout a lheure!

Coleoptera NuclearMarkers answers
Thanks from our lab to all those friendly responses to
our query. Herewith again my original request and the
promised summary of all the suggestions and tips (if
you are interested in PDFs or protocolls or other links
- please let me know, I won’t attach it all here cause I
don’t want to hog all your mailboxes):
our initial query: “we are busy with phyolgeographic
studies of Scarabs (Coleoptera) and are struggling to
get enough good loci in a microsatellite library (even us-
ing enrichment). Does anyone have experience with mi-
crosatellites in beetles and would be prepared to share
this (especially encountered problems or special tricks
or idiosyncracies)? Is it possible that Coleoptera (justas Lepidoptera) do not have that many microsatellite
loci? Could you recommend any other nuclear marker
for phylogeographic and conservation genetic studies in
beetles?”
..and now ...the answers:
1) I would say that Coleoptera have plenty of mi-
crosatellites, but they are diﬃcult to ﬁnd.
I suggest two things.
1- try and get access to the EST libraries of Volger and
company, see attached paper. Scan these EST seqe-
unces for microsatellites. 2- move on and try and get
nuclear gene markers that are variable with indels. I
think that this is pretty easy to do. Again, get the ri-
bosomal protein genes for Coleoptera, which are now
in gene bank. Make primers at the 5’ and 3’ end of
these genes and PCR them for several individuals. I
imagine you will ﬁnd some size variation in the PCR
products. Just use this as your molecular marker. You
could also try and do Restriction Enzyme digests on
these PCR products that don’t have any size variation-
to get variation among individuals in what cuts/does
not cut.
See the second attached paper explaining that using nu-
clear genes can be just as informative as microsatellite
loci. Given that you probably can’t get the micorsatel-
lite loci, you certainly can get the ribosomal proteins
to PCR for your species.
best of luck and let me know if you have any questions,
Chris
2) Dear Ute,
my husband was just forwarding me your mail, there are
two things: ﬁrst it looks as if some beetles really do not
have many repetative sequences in the genome, but thatAugust 1, 2006 EvolDir 25
is not easy to estimate. In the lab I used to work were
two students which were isolating mircosats from bee-
tles (Curculionoidea and Chrysomeloidea), and both
had problems but at the end they got some. Here in
Madrid they use a very fast PCR based method that
seems to work well for the group of animals they are
working with. If you want I can ask the detailed pro-
tocol. The other thing is that you could try ITS, this
is easy to amplify and for population/subspecies stud-
ies not too bad. This might be worth to try. I have
been using this for Lepidoptera and certainly can ﬁnd
the primer sequence but they should be available in the
literature.
Hope that helps a bit, in case you have some molecular
questions please do not hesitate to ask, I am not very
good with the beetles but the molecular work is ﬁne.
Greetings to Clarke, even though he might not remem-
ber me from the time in London, since I am not a beetle
person.
All the best, Ali – Dr. Alexandra Cieslak Department

3) We have developed primer sets for about 65 gene
regions (single- copy protein coding genes) IF you are
interested in cDNA work (RT-PCR). If you are uncom-
fortable working with RNA, we have a few of the same
genes that work with genomic DNA.

4) Dear Ute,
In response to your message regarding useful nuclear
markers in Coleoptera: I am a phylogeneticist spe-
cializing in Auchenorrhyncha (Hemiptera), however,
I worked on a molecular phylogenetic the Hawaiian
Platynini (Carabidae; Jim Liebherr’s group of interest)
as a Post-doc. Attached is a .pdf of the paper resulting
from my work with that group, in which I sequenced
28S and wingless from the nuclear genome. I know that
Jim Liebherr has published a number of other papers on
Platynini that deal more speciﬁcally with the group’s
phylogeography, as well.
Best of luck!

5) Hi Ute, I’m a PhD student working on beetles (Tene-brionidae) in fragmented systems. I too have found it
very diﬃcult to develop good microsatellite loci as well
as other non-microsatelite nuclear markers for popula-
tion genetics. The best I can oﬀer is our paper (at-
tached): Schmuki C, Blacket MJ, Sunnucks, P (2006)

Database Plant Biogeo26 EvolDir August 1, 2006
We have established a simple database for plant histor-
ical biogeography which is accessible under
http://www.plant-biogeography.fb10.uni-mainz.de
The intention of this database is to facilitate the
search for comparative data in the area of historical
plant biogeography. Accordingly, you can search by
taxon, distribution range and age (of origin of a range)
either alone or in combination. First entries can be
found under, e.g., Chenopodiaceae, Gentianaceae,
Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Restionaceae. The database
will only be ﬁlled through the input of data by authors
of biogeographical publications. As the usefulness of
the database increases with the amount of data it
contains, it would be helpful if you could enter your
own data. Plant images and distribution maps can be
added to your information on taxon, distribution and
age.
Any contribution is greatly appreciated!

of bee related information.
Interactive biogeographic maps can be viewed at:
http://stri.discoverlife.org/mp/20m?act=make map.
Users can generate global maps of any species or group
of species, can zoom or overlay map layers, and can
pull up individual record information by clicking on the
map. Lists of species names can be accessed by typing
in the genus name in the search box of the Discover
Life Home Page ( http://www.discoverlife.org ).John Ascher at the American Museum of Natural His-
tory has added over 10,000 georeferenced specimen
records. To facilitate this, he uploaded 18,000 valid
(and nominally valid) names of world bee species to the
site. This initial species list should be used with cau-
tion. Updates with additions and corrections of errors
already discovered will be made soon.
Leah Larkin at the University of New Mexico has added
over 24,000 georeferenced specimen records compiled
from several museums and the literature.
These databases join the existing 80,000 records from
the University of Kansas and the USGS Patuxent

EtOHpreservation pHBuﬀering
Dear Evol-dir readers,
I would like to know whether any reader can add to
my observations and resulting proposal about the useAugust 1, 2006 EvolDir 27
of a pH buﬀer in the alcohol used to preserve marine
(or other) collections.
My particular interest is in brachiopods, most of which
have calcitic shells.
The shells of specimens that have been in pickle for
a long time (e.g. a newly-received batch preserved in
1991) are invariably weaker than they would be when
fresh.
Many of my collections are kept in heat-sealed plastic
bags, and it is evident that even at -20C, gas slowly
evolves during longterm storage; the bags swell.
It is well known that the pH of distilled water is gen-
erally about 5.5 because of bicarbonate ions from ab-
sorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Putting these facts together I conclude that the acidity
of unbuﬀered ca. 70% - 90% ethanol attacks calcite,
with the liberation of carbon dioxide and that it would
be better for the alcohol to be buﬀered above pH 7.0.
This might also reduce DNA degradation.
Hence my question:
Does anyone use buﬀered 70% - 90% ethanol for the
preservation of specimens for DNA-based work and, if
so, with what recipe, rationale and results?
If buﬀered ethanol is not in general use, is it not likely
to be a better preservative than unbuﬀered?

Flowering schedules
We study assortative mating by ﬂowering time in
plants, and we have recently developed new quanti-
tative methods to determine the degree of assortative
mating and the eﬀects of this assortment on reproduc-
tive isolation and potential gene ﬂow. We are currently
looking for data sets with which to apply these meth-
ods.
We are looking for published or unpublished data sets
containing ﬂowering schedules. Flowering schedules are
descriptions, for individual plants, of the number of
ﬂowers open at speciﬁc time intervals (daily, weekly,
etc.) for the duration of the ﬂowering period either for
the lifetime of the plant or for at least one season in
perennials. The ideal form of the data is a matrix in a
spreadsheet or text ﬁle with individuals listed as rows
and time periods listed as columns.
The plants can be of any species and the data can be
from populations in the ﬁeld, greenhouse or lab. Re-
searchers studying plant mating systems, pollination
biology, reproductive ecology, plant phenology and de-
velopment, ﬂoral biology, population ecology, natural
selection, demography, or rare plant conservation biol-
ogy may be especially likely to have such data.
If you also have any other quantitative genetic infor-
mation, such as heritability estimates or selection gradi-
ents, population genetic data, demographic data or any
other population level information on the same plants,
this would be especially valuable.
If you have data meeting these speciﬁcations or know
of anyone who does, please contact Art Weis at
aeweis@uci.edu. We will be happy to provide sample
data and relevant reprints upon request.

Frozen Ark Project
Other: The Frozen Ark Project
Evolutionary biologists may be interested to know
about this project, which aims to save the DNA (and,
where possible,frozen viable cells) of endangered species
before they go extinct,
Many individual museums, zoos, and other research in-
stitutions have made frozen collections, but the Ark
aims to set up an international consortium so that we
can sample the world’s endangered species in a sys-
tematic fashion. Currently we have members in the
USA, Britain, India, South Africa, Australia and New
Zealand It is a very large task, so we seek individu-
als and organizations interested enough to contribute
their time, expertise or money to this objective. We
are only concerned with endangered species. Becoming
a member of the Frozen Ark Consortium demands a
high degree of commitment.
Information about the Frozen Ark can be found on its
web site ( www.frozenark.org ) and/or by emailing me

by using the ML method proposed by Sanderson &
Donoghue in a paper published on Science in 1994
(“Shifts in diversiﬁcation rate with the origin of An-
giosperms”). I read that this method is already im-
plemented in a software that is called LRDIVERSE. Is
that information correct? If so, does anyone know how
can I download a copy of the software?

Leaf Area survey
Ecological study of herbivory often requires estimation
of leaf area removal. Methods of measuring leaf area
removal vary from using visual estimation, to utiliz-
ing more exact digital quantiﬁcation. Computer soft-
ware/hardware for digital leaf area measurement , al-
though accurate, can be time consuming, expensive,
and cannot always be brought to the ﬁeld. On the
other hand, visual estimation is a very quick and easy
method to use in the ﬁeld. Upon searching articles
that dealt with leaf herbivory, more than 1/3 used a
form of visual estimation, often categorizing leaves by
their percent herbivory into anywhere from 3-8 cate-
gories. Although visual estimation is a commonly used
method, the accuracy of this method is not known. Our
aim is to determine the accuracy of visual estimation
in comparison to digital quantiﬁcation through the use
of a web based survey. This survey is composed of 100
leaves with varying percentages of herbivory. Below
the picture of the leaf are a series of buttons listing
each category of herbivory (1% <, 1-25%, 26-50%...).August 1, 2006 EvolDir 29
The surveyor then chooses the corresponding category
to which he or she believes best describes the leaf area
loss. We would greatly appreciate your anonymous par-
ticipation in this survey which should take no more than
10 minutes to complete. This is part of a larger research
project that also includes the development of leaf area
measurement software for PDAs. This software pro-
gram will be accurate and easy to use in the ﬁeld. If
you would like more information about this software or
if you are interested in testing a free copy once it is
ﬁnished, please leave your e-mail on the survey infor-
mation page. Thank you for taking the time to read
about my research and participate in the survey. Your
completion of this survey will help with the develop-
ment of better methods for herbivory measurement in
the ﬁeld.

Microsat data
Hi all, I have a set of microsatellite data of a tetraploid
species, and there are less than 5% individual-locu com-
binations shew multi-alleles (3 and 4). Since it seems
that no program can do HWE and LD on polyploid mi-
crosatellite, and also estimate various genetic distances
(although genetic diversity can be calcualted using the
recent program TETRASAT), I want to treat multi-
allele combinations as missing data, and then run the
data as diploid. Could you give me some suggestoions
or comments? Thanks.

Onagraceae samples
I am writing in the hopes that some of the Evoldir recip-
ients can help us obtain seed from a number of species
in the Evening Primrose family (Onagraceae). In col-
laboration with Mark Rausher (Duke University) and
Warren Wagner (Smithsonian Institute), we are study-
ing how variation in plant sexual systems aﬀects the
molecular and phenotypic evolution of plant defenses
in the Onagraceae. In this project, we are taking a
comparative approach and as such we require seed from
various Calylophus spp., Gaura spp., Gayophytum spp.,
and Oenothera spp. distributed across North America
and South America. If you would be willing to help us
obtain seed for any of the species listed below, please
do not hesitate to send me an email (or call).
Thank you very much!

Phylogeographical Info System
Over last 20 years a very large number of phylogeo-
graphic and population genetic studies have been pub-
lished. This body of data constitutes a Millennium
baseline for spatial genetic variation (a component of
biodiversity). Analysis of the data has resulted in the
identiﬁcation of common spatial pattern that has ex-
tended our knowledge of the role of past climate and
landscape change in the generation of biodiversity and
speciation. Hypothesized historical scenarios have been
shown to correlate to sub-fossil evidence and more re-
cently the output of ecological niche models coupled
to palaeoclimate reconstructions. Geographical infor-
mation systems have recently been employed to ana-
lyze distribution maps of related taxa to identify suture
zones as well as support the above activities. There is,
however, no central data repository for the storage of
phylogeographic reconstructions and hence the facili-
tating of such comparative and interdisciplinary analy-
ses.
Sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Cen-
ter ( www.nescent.org <http://www.nescent.org/ >) I
am developing a phylogeographical information system
(PGIS) for storing, visualizing and analyzing phylogeo-
graphic data as spatiotemporal networks (trees, net-
works and pairwise distance matrices). Presently the
PGIS is an early prototype; however, to test the sys-
tem and aid in the development of analysis and visual-
ization tools I wish to collate phylogeographic models
for European and Mesoamerican taxa. Speciﬁcally, I
am putting out a request for phylogeographic data for
European and Mesoamerican taxa (within and between
taxa). I request,
1. Trees as a NEWICK strings. 2. Sequences and
character matrices from which the trees were derived.
3. Meta data on tree construction. 4. Coordinates for
sample locations.August 1, 2006 EvolDir 31
Variety is good as I am intending to develop a generic
model. Please note that I am also putting out speciﬁc
requests for published data, however, the less of these
I make the more time I have for system development.
I am also interested in feedback from the wider com-
munity on potential applications, analysis methods and
collaborative eﬀorts. NESCent funds working groups to
stimulate and develop such synthetic collaborations.
Look out for the forthcoming editorial in the Journal
of Biogeography, Kidd and Ritchie (2006) Phylogeo-
graphic information systems: putting the geography
into phylogeography. J of Biogeog., in press.

PlantBiogeography database
We have established a simple database for plant histor-
ical biogeography which is accessible under
http://www.plant-biogeography.fb10.uni-mainz.de
The intention of this database is to facilitate the
search for comparative data in the area of historical
plant biogeography. Accordingly, you can search by
taxon, distribution range and age (of origin of a range)
either alone or in combination. First entries can be
found under, e.g., Chenopodiaceae, Gentianaceae,
Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Restionaceae. The database
will only be ﬁlled through the input of data by authors
of biogeographical publications. As the usefulness of
the database increases with the amount of data it
contains, it would be helpful if you could enter your
own data. Plant images and distribution maps can be
added to your information on taxon, distribution and
age.
Any contribution is greatly appreciated!

PublEvol survey answers
Dear All
thank you very much for your responses about publish-
ing evolution biology.
There were 136 respondents! (and four later ones not
incorporated yet). 1 from Argentina, 4 Australia, 2
Belgium, 9 Canada, 1 Colombia, 2 Finland, 3 France
6 Germany, 1 Greece, 10 International or unknown, 1
India, 1 Italy, 1 Japan, 1 New Zealand, 4 Netherlands,
1 Norway, 2 Portugal, 3 South Africa, 1 Spain, 4 Swe-
den, 8 Switzerland, 17 United Kingdom, 51 USA, 1
Venezuela.
I posed the questions to help inform the debate that
the Society for the Study of Evolution and its journal
EVOLUTION is having about the fairest and best way
to publish evolutionary biology, but the opinions and
information I summarize here do not necessary reﬂect
the views of the SSE.
Please read this with some generosity it is far from
perfect and is not rigorous in data collection, analysis
or presentation. But I think there are some interesting
messages here about what people think about publish-
ing, and how this diﬀers among regions. Interestingly,
there are strongly dichotomous opinions among people
who would like the same outcomes as each other.
COMMENTS MADE ABOUT MODE OF PUBLISH-
ING / ACCESSIBILITY32 EvolDir August 1, 2006
PAGE CHARGES & WAIVERS Interesting dichotomy:
ON ONE HAND. 13 people (x) said they oppose
page charges on principle 14 x Poorly funded peo-
ple/countries cant aﬀord page charges, page charges are
the ﬁrst thing to go when funds are tight / after end of
grant after retirement Numerous people said waivers for
page charges when people cant aﬀord them are a good
thing. That said, many people dont ask for waivers,
but many do and all but only ~6% are granted.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND 11x approve of open ac-
cess publishing because of its fairness to poorly-funded
people, but they usually entail high page charges. Sev-
eral also pointed out that many Non-proﬁt / Soci-
ety journals / Open Access tend to have higher page
charges for good reasons that have fair outcomes for
access, and so favour these journals.
So open access and cheap journals are great for equal-
izing access to READING science, but they entail page
charges, sowill work best to make PUBLISHING acces-
sible to everyone if there is a near-perfect waiver sys-
tem for people who cannot aﬀord page charges. This
assumes that publishing has to be paid for somewhere,
and presumably a good way to help is to reduce the
cost of publishing.
ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING COMMENTS 3x
Should go entirely electronic. Various suggestions for
improved features (bibliographic software interface,
colour, cheapness, print format, speed).
EDITORIAL ISSUES 5x Double-blind reviewing
should be used
The journal Evolution should be faster - but 2x said
the journal has done well in increasing speed
Pauls comment: handling times have been coming down
consistently for the last 5 years, and are ~20% faster
than in 2000. New processes will make them faster still.
But it will take a while for people to realize how strong
the improvement has been.
10x Evolution has high quality articles / scientiﬁc stan-
dards 2x Should accept LaTeX
CONTENT of journals in the ﬁeld We need more jour-
nals in evolutionary biology There should be an applied
evolution journal We need a low-end evolutionary biol-
ogy journal
SOME SUMMARIES of responses to questions
Q1. If you have to pay page charges to publish in a good
journal (typically in the order of USD60 per page), how
much of a disincentive relative to other factors is this
to submit to that journal?
Several common responses: - free-access supporters:there is no disincentive because paying to publish means
free/cheap access for poorly-funded scientists - its-
unethical-to-charge-to-publish-science supporters: to-
tal disincentive - will not submit papers to journals
with page charges on principle - journal quality is very
important, and if high enough, will pay page charges
- depends on level of funding. Scientists from poorly-
funded countries and many graduate students (etc) else-
where avoid page charges
There were strong regional diﬀerences in opinions about
page charges.
North Americans, Scandinavians and Swiss responded
similarly to each other (page charges no issue ~55%,
some issue ~30%, big issue ~15%) - while UK & conti-
nental Europe were less kindly-disposed to page charges
(page charges no issue ~35%, some issue ~20%, big is-
sue~45%) - while Australasia, S America, S Africa and
India were reasonably consistent in almost the oppo-
site response: (page charges no issue ~15%, some issue
~25%, big issue ~60%)
Q2. Have you ever decided to not submit to a particular
journal on the basis that you would incur page charges,
and if so, how often (eg rarely, usually etc)?
Common answers: -Never -Avoid if at all possible
within limits of publishing in good, relevant journal -
Will certainly choose a no-charge journal over equiva-
lent one that charges

SelectiveSweeps
Hi,
I’m looking for examples of a selective sweep occurring
at the same locus in multiple species.
In other words, cases in which an allele has swept re-
cently (recently enough to infer the sweeps occurrence),
but independently in two (or more) species in the same
gene. I’m guessing this may be most likely in arms-
race scenarios, e.g. host/parasite interaction or sexual
conﬂict genes.
I am only interested in nuclear and recombining genes,
i.e. not plastids/mitochondria or Y chromosomes.August 1, 2006 EvolDir 33
Any pointers to the literature would be much appreci-
ated!

Any species will do, as long as I can have 5-10 indi-
viduals, determined to the species level, killed and pre-
served in liquid nitrogen or -80C. I will cover expenses
for shipping in dry ice via DHL.

Bergen EvolFishEcolPOST DOC IN EVOLUTIONARY FISHERIES
ECOLOGY
Postdoctoral fellowship is available in the project “Sus-
tainable harvesting of marine resources” funded by the
Research Council of Norway. The project is run as col-
laboration between Institute of Marine Research and
University of Bergen, Norway. The project will in-
vestigate the eﬀects of ﬁsheries-induced evolution by a
combination of theoretical life-history models, species-
speciﬁc life-history models, and selection experiments.
For more information on the project, see http://-
www.uib.no/people/nzlcj/sustainable/ . The postdoc-
toral position is hosted by the Institute of Marine Re-
search ( http://www.imr.no ). IMR is one of the largest
marine research institutes in the world, focusing on
both applied and fundamental research. The main of-
ﬁce of IMR is located in Bergen, an attractive town with
rich cultural and academic life, and with surroundings
oﬀering excellent opportunities for all sorts of outdoor
pursuits.
The postdoctoral fellow, together with PhD student to
be hired to the project at the university, will use math-
ematical modelling to investigate: * eﬀects of ﬁshing
on life history traits using energy allocation models for
Atlantic cod, herring, and blue whiting, * coupling be-
tween oceanographic circulation models and the dis-
persal of early life history stages, and * the eﬀects
that diﬀerences in larval survival and growth at diﬀer-
ent spawning locations along the Norwegian coast may
have on the evolution of age and size at maturation and
length of the spawning migrations.
The postdoctoral position includes a 6-month visit to
the Department of Biology at University of California,
Riverside ( http://www.biology.ucr.edu/ ) where the fel-
low has opportunity to work with professor David
Reznick and professor Derek Roﬀ. The qualiﬁcations
are a PhD degree in a relevant ﬁeld and skills in life
history theory, ecological and evolutionary modelling
and an interest in ﬁsheries.
The postdoctoral position is for 36 months. The salary
follows the government scale (level 54, currently NOK
378,400/ year, or about 48,000 EUR/year). Female ap-
plicants are strongly encouraged to apply. Preferred
starting date is in early autumn 2006. The review
of applications will start August 18 and continue un-
til the position is ﬁlled. For more information, please

Postdoctoral position in Conservation Biology
Dept. Conservation Biology, Institute of Zoology, Uni-
versity of Berne, Switzerland.
Scientists with a background education in natural
sciences (biology, ecology and related ﬁelds) are in-
vited to apply for a postdoctoral research position
opened at the Division of Conservation Biology, In-
stitute of Zoology, University of Bern, Switzerland.
Launched in 2001 this research division is active in
the ﬁelds of resource exploitation patterns (ecological
niche requirements, from foraging ecology and habi-
tat selection analysis to GIS modelling) and popula-
tion dynamics (from estimation of basic vital param-
eters to integrated models, including population vi-
ability analysis). Main research focus is on threat-
ened, emblematic species of agro-ecosystems and Alpine
ecosystems (see <http://www.conservation.unibe.ch/-
>www.conservation.unibe.ch ). There is no taxon lim-
itation in our projects within the animal realm. All
candidates with skills in scientiﬁc Conservation Biology
in the broad sense of the term will be considered, but
priority will be given to experienced researchers with
a good publication record. The tenant is expected to
contribute to the ongoing research programmes of the
division (including assistance in undergraduate teach-
ing and supervision), but will also develop his/her ﬁeld
of research. Complementary competence to the above
mentioned expertise is welcome. An ideal candidate
would for instance have speciﬁc skills and interest for
the development of genetic methods to assess dispersal
patterns in animal populations.
The position is available for up to six years, with in-
termediate evaluations every second year. A 80-100%
position would be preferred; lower employment grade
is to be discussed. Salaries will follow the schemes of
the University of Bern. Supervisors: Rapha¨ el Arlettaz

Beyond BLAST and FASTA - Alignment: from pro-
teins to genomes - This course presents a comprehen-
sive overview of the theory and practice of computa-
tional methods for extracting the maximum amount of
information from protein and DNA sequence similarity
through sequence database searches, statistical analy-
sis, and multiple sequence alignment, and genome scale
alignment. Additional topics include gene ﬁnding, den-
tifying signals in unaligned sequences, integration of ge-
netic and sequence information in biological databases.
The course combines lectures with hands-on exercises;
students are encouraged to pose challenging sequence
analysis problems using their own data. The course
makes extensive use of local WWW pages to present
problem sets and the computing tools to solve them.
Students use Windows and Mac workstations attached
to a UNIX server; participants should be comfortable
using the Unix operating system and a Unix text editor.
The course is designed for biologists seeking advanced
training in biological sequence analysis, computational
biology core resource directors and staﬀ, and for scien-
tists in other disciplines, such as computer science, who
wish to survey current research problems in biologicalsequence analysis and comparative genomics.
The primary focus of the Computational and Compar-
ative Genomics Course is the theory and practice of al-
gorithms used in computational biology, with the goal
of using current methods more eﬀectively and develop-
ing new algorithms. Cold Spring Harbor also oﬀers a
“Programming for Biology” course, which focuses more
on software development.
Over the past few years, the course has been expanded
to cover more algorithms and exercises on comparative
genomics and genome databases.

Summary: More than 30 years ago, Theodosius
Dobzhansky claimed: ˆ aNothing in Biology makes sense
except in the light of evolutionˆ a. Currently, the sim-
plest Bioinformatics analysis uses species comparisons
in order to hypothesise the function of an novel bio-
logical sequence. Moreover, in most Molecular Biology
labs, evolutionary and phylogenetic concepts are con-
stantly being used with more or less formality: homol-
ogy, similarity, evolutionary rates, long branch attrac-
tion, rooted and unrooted trees, monophyletic group,
molecular clocks, lineage eﬀects, neutralism, clado-
grams, phylograms, etc. The course covers these and
other major concepts in Evolutionary Biology and Phy-
logenetics. Attendees will acquire speciﬁc skills in using
the methodology in Comparative and Evolutionary Bi-
ology problems. The course is designed to be a mixture
of theoretical and practical sessions developed in 5 days,
where both classic and recently introduced methods for
phylogenetic reconstruction will be covered. As a out-
come of the more recent developments in Genomics,
the course dedicates a day to Phylogenomics. Phyml,
Phylip, MEGA, TreePuzzle, MrBayes and Modeltest-
Protest are some of the software resources that will be
used in the practical sessions. Elementary knowledge
of Biochemistry and Sequence Analysis is useful though
not strictly required.

UDublin Biodiversity
MSc./PgDip. in Biodiversity and Conservation School
of Natural Sciences, University of Dublin, Trinity Col-
lege, IrelandThis new course will provide in-depth training and ex-
perience for those looking to further their career in vari-
ous aspects of biodiversity and its conservation, for stu-
dents wishing to pursue further post-graduate research
in this area, and for professionals already working in
conservation biology wishing to obtain relevant quali-
ﬁcations. The course will be taught in modules, and
these are grouped into theoretical components, practi-
cal research skills, and modules dealing with individ-
ual desk and experimental research projects. Students
may omit the individual research project to be awarded
a Post-graduate Diploma, those wishing to obtain the
degree of Master in Science must complete a four month
individual research project. The School of Natural Sci-
ences has considerable research and teaching capability
in biodiversity and conservation, and the course will be
taught by staﬀ who are actively engaged in a variety
of relevant research projects. Staﬀ from relevant State
agencies and institutions who are active in the practi-
cal application of conservation science, and biodiversity
and conservation policy, will also make contributions to
the course teaching. In Spring there will be an overseas
ﬁeld course, the venue for this course has not yet been
ﬁnalised.
The course will be taught through a variety of methods
- lectures, practicals, ﬁeld-based learning, guided read-
ing and discussion groups and web-based methods. A
variety of assessment procedures will also be adopted -
essay writing, oral presentations, web-based tests, ex-
aminations and assessment of dissertations. The ap-
proach will be to develop, progressively, a high degree
of independent thinking and academic excellence in stu-
dents completing the course, providing a smooth tran-
sition for those entering both directly from undergrad-
uate degrees, and for those entering the course from
industry.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that46 EvolDir August 1, 2006
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
