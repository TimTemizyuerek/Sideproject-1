organisers can be listed as an invited speaker on an-
other proposal Each symposium will include one invited
speaker plus a number of contributed speaker The in-
vited speaker included within a symposium should have
verbally agreed to be involved before the proposal is
submitted An individual can only give one talk at the
SMBE meeting, so in the event that a speaker is invited
to two successful symposium applications the organisers
should consider a back up The Society provides some
nancial support, in the form of complimentary confer-
ence registration, to facilitate symposium organisers in
attracting outstanding invited speakers Symposium or-
ganisers should provide a description of the symposium
(250 words max) that will be made public if selected.

Title: Long-read sequencing of 3,622 Icelanders provides
insight into the role of structural variants in human
diseases and other traits
Abstract: Long-read sequencing (LRS) promises to im-
prove the characterization of structural variants (SVs).
Upon generating LRS data from 3,622 Icelanders, we
identied a median of 22,636 SVs per individual, and
investigated their impacts in human diseases and other
traits. We discovered an association of a rare 14kb
deletion in PCSK9 with lower low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol levels, and of a multiallelic SV in a
tandem repeat region within ACAN and height, where
a higher number of repeats carried indicated increase in
height. These results show that SVs can be accurately
characterized at the population scale using LRS data ina genome-wide non-targeted approach and demonstrate
how SVs impact phenotypes.

Dear All,
The CIGENE seminars are being held on a weekly basis
the next few weeks. We are pleased to announce the
next week's presenter and welcome Dr. Pam Wiener
from the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh.
She will present: Probing domesticated animal genomes
to investigate history and phenotype Abstract: The
work I will describe relates to the application of selec-
tion mapping, the use of genetic diversity patterns to
infer historical processes and dissect genetic architec-
ture, to domesticated animal species. I will describe
examples of this approach to map genes associated with
animal production, morphological features and environ-
mental adaptation. I will also discuss how these studies
provide insights into the selection pressures that have
been imposed on the studied populations and, more
generally, contribute to the understanding of convergent
evolution.

Title: Calpain DEK1 acts as a developmental switch
gatekeeping cell fate transitions
Abstract: We initially studied the Dek1 (Defective ker-
nel 1) gene due to its essential function in forming the
aleurone layer of the cereal endosperm. The gene en-
codes a Ca2+activated cysteine protease termed calpain
(Lid et al., PNAS 2002). Soon after, it became clear
that the DEK1 protein serves a fundamental role in land
plants, ranging from the earliest diverging land plants
formed 500 million years ago to owering plants. Al-
though subsequent studies during the following twenty
years have associated diverse cellular and developmental
functions with the Dek1 gene, a mechanistic and integra-
tive understanding of its molecular function and role in
these diverse developmental and biological processes has
been missing. In animals, including humans, calpains
are viewed as modulatory proteases displaying severe,
pleiotropic phenotypes. Calpain cleavage targets were
recently shown to be directed to the N-end rule degrada-
tory pathway. Several of these destabilized targets are
transcription factors, hinting at a gene regulatory role
of the cysteine protease. Here, we analyze the gene
regulatory networks of the moss Physcomitrium patens
and characterize the regulons that are deregulated in
Dek1 calpain mutants. Predicted cleavage patterns of
the regulatory hierarchies in the ve DEK1-controlled
subnetworks are consistent with the gene's pleiotropy
and the regulatory role in cell fate transitions target-
ing a broad spectrum of functions. Network structure
suggests DEK1-gated sequential transition between cell
fates in 2D to 3D development. We anticipate that both
our method combining phenotyping, transcriptomics
and data science to dissect phenotypic traits and our
model explaining the calpain's role as a switch gatekeep-
ing cell fate transitions will inform biology beyond plant
development.

Hi all,
Welcome to the next CIGENE seminar, where Kathryn
Elmer, Professor at Institute of Biodiversity Animal
Health & Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow
will give a presentation entitled:
Parallel evolution of adaptive divergences in a freshwater
salmonid
Abstract: The repeated diversication of postglacial
shes into ecotype specialists in northern freshwaters
is a major source of temperate biodiversity and a long-
standing model for studying evolution. I will present
some of our recently published work on the evolutionary,
genomic, and transcriptomic underpinnings of ecotype
specialists in Arctic charr. This work is geographically
broad, as it compares within regions and also across
distinct lineages spanning Scotland and Siberia. We
nd extensive variation in historical and demographic
background yet parallel evolution of ecologically relevant
forms.

Venue: Online Zoom and Spatial.Chat (hosted by
Ci >1
2ncias, University of Lisbon)
This is a reminder for the International Meeting of
the Portuguese Association for Evolutionary Biology
(ENBE). ENBE aims to bring together Evolutionary
Biologists working in Portugal and abroad in order to
promote scientic cohesion and excellence. This is a
small informal meeting with usually 60-120 participants
that provides a supportive environment for discussion
for scientists of all academic levels (from master stu-
dents to principal investigators), fostering new ideas and
collaborations.
We are happy to announce that we have received many
submissions for the XVII ENBE. However, because we
wish to increase the diversity of participants, across
groups within Portugal and beyond, we will keep accept-
ing abstract submissions for the ENBE 2021. The new
deadline for abstract submission is 31st October 2021
(23:59 GMT+1).
We wish to make ENBE an opportunity to strength and
establish new interactions and collaborations. We en-
courage participation from evolutionary biologists from
dierent research groups, geographical areas and nation-
alities.
The conference will run online for two afternoons so
that people working in dierent time zones are able toattend. Registration fee is symbolic and free for mem-
bers of APBE (Portuguese Association for Evolutionary
Biology). We hope in this way to make the conference
as open and accessible as possible.

e.g., Masters, PhD or postdoc and aliation. Abstract
submission and registration are separate portals, both
on the YSF event page.
Space will be allocated subject to availability and for a
balanced programme of animal, plant, algal, microbial,
molecular and other research. Non-presenting attendees
are also very welcome - please register as above.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English
and in Word format no later than Friday 22 October
2021. The body text should not exceed 150 words in
length. Title, authors, and their professional alia-8 EvolDir November 1, 2021
tions/addresses should be included with the abstracts.If
the presentation is co-authored,the actual speakermust
be clearly indicated in BOLD text. The le should
be in editable format (.doc or .odt, not pdf) and ti-
tled Surname First-name YSF2019.doc, for example

Again the YSF will be held the day after the-
Molluscan Forum(http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also online (and at the Natural
History Museum). If attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we ask
that you submit only for a ash talk presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).If you are a postdoc, please be awarethat it's
unlikely we will be able to give you a chance to present
here, as the aim is to give more junior researchers their
rst experience in a supportive international setting.
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

Announcing two in-person meetings on Microbial Popu-
lation Biology for Summer of 2022. We look forward to
bringing the Microbial Population Biology community
back together in the Summer of 2022 at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl on.
During two independent, 4-day meetings, we will em-
brace thought-provoking discussions and community
engagement on cutting edge topics in microbial evolu-
tion. Applicants may apply to either or both meetings.
Both meetings will feature invited speakers, and we also
welcome applications for short talks and poster presen-
tations. We aim to have all participants present their

Belgian 3
QuaternaryEvolAntarcticLakes
Three research positions (2 fully funded PhD fellow-
ships, 1 PhD or Post-doc) in 'Late Quaternary evolu-
tionary dynamics of Cyanobacteria and eukaryote biota
in Antarctic lakes'
Ghent University and the University of Li >1
2ge are re-
cruiting two PhD students who will be engaged in the
recently started project HabitAnt: 'Past and future
habitability in Antarctic lakes: succession, colonization,
extinction, and survival in glacial refugia', funded by
BelSPO BRAIN-BE. The project also includes the Royal
Institute of Natural Sciences (Brussels) where the inver-
tebrates will be studied by a research assistant (PhD or
postdoc level).
Context
Coupled climate and Earth-system models predict in-
creased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns
in vast regions of Maritime and coastal Continental
Antarctica. These changes will likely result in more ex-
tensive glacial melt and the expansion of ice-free areas,
increasing connectivity between regions, and changes in
their hydrology. These projected environmental changes
are expected to cause biotic homogenization between re-
gions. Recent studies demonstrated that terrestrial and
lacustrine biota in the Antarctic are more globally dis-
tinct and biogeographically structured than previously
believed, due to the long-term survival and diversica-
tion of taxa in isolated glacial refugia. Hence, it is to be
expected that biotic homogenisation will signicantly
increase the risk of extinction of endemic species and
the spread of invasive species.
The students' work will be organized to design two (or
three) complementary PhD theses. They will use fos-
sil DNA in lake sediment cores, and develop molecular
phylogenies of focal taxa to study the processes that
contributed to the present-day diversity of organisms
in Antarctic lakes. The processes studied include thelong-term persistence of biota in glacial refugia, and
extinction, colonization, diversication and biological
succession in response to past climate and environmental
changes.
Job description
The job tasks will include:
- Extraction of fossil DNA and the development of DNA
libraries for high- throughput sequencing.
- Development of multi-gene molecular phylogenies.
- Bioinformatics and statistical analysis of metagenomic
and DNA amplicon datasets.
We oer an intellectually challenging environment, high-
quality training to develop hard and soft skills, and
opportunities to participate in sampling campaigns to
Antarctica and international scientic conferences. The
research fellows will be hosted at the three dierent
Belgian partner institutions, but joint PhD degrees are
envisaged and several tasks will be done in a close col-
laboration between the respective research groups.

Project Background
Bees are important pollinators of agricultural and wild
plants, yet they also face many challenges, including
habitat loss, pesticides, diseases, and poor nutrition.
Among the most important pollinators in temperate
regions are honeybees (Apis mellifera) and, in the trop-
ics, the stingless bees (Meliponini). People keep bees
in apiaries to facilitate beekeeping and pollination. For
traditional communities in the Amazon, beekeeping of
native Brazilian stingless bees is of both economic and
cultural importance as bees provide food, income, and
medicinal products. However, keeping bees in apiaries
in highly disturbed environments is challenging as bees
might struggle to nd enough food, leading to poor
health of colonies. Furthermore, the proximity of hives
in an apiary promotes \drifting", which means that bees
enter the wrong hive and leads to disease spread and
lowers the honey and pollen production of colonies.
Project Aims and Methods
This project brings together an exciting mix of method-
ological approaches to study how \drifting" in stingless
bees in Brazil and in honeybees in the UK is related to
their foraging landscape. The project will study drifting
in environments varying in human disturbance, particu-
larly dierent degrees of deforestation and urbanisation.
The main aims are (1) to identify the key food sources
for bees in modied and natural environments; (2) to14 EvolDir November 1, 2021
investigate if food source availability and diversity af-
fects drifting behaviour; (3) to test whether entrance
guarding by guard bees can prevent drifting and (4)
whether articial landmarks in apiaries can reduce drift-
ing behaviour. Results will help us identify the most
important food sources for these important pollinators
and help improve the health and productivity of bees.
The project will study stingless bee hives kept by tradi-
tional communities in the Maranh ao state in the Brazil-
ian Amazon region, which has been heavily aected by
deforestation and in honeybee hives inhabiting dierent
landscapes in the South West of England. Pollen quan-
tity and diversity will be assessed using DNA metabar-
coding, while drifting is studied using Radio-frequency
identication (RFID) tracking of bees and behavioural
observations. In addition to these aims, the project
provides opportunities for the candidate to build on or
modify the project and develop their own research ideas
within the general research topic.
Candidate requirements
We seek a highly motivated, dedicated, and collabo-
rative student with an interest in behaviour, ecology,
and entomology. You should be eager to learn about
the natural history of bees, molecular methods, and
bioinformatic tools. We welcome and encourage student
applications from under-represented groups. We value
a diverse research environment.
Project partners
This project provides an exciting opportunity to col-
laborate with Meli, a not-for-prot organisation that
uses native beekeeping, educational activities, and re-
generative agricultural initiatives to support traditional
communities in Brazil. The candidate will work with
beekeepers to study a fascinating group of social bees,
the Meliponini, and their interactions with the envi-
ronment. With the help of Meli, the student will gain
experience in the day-to-day business of an environ-
mental organisation that is passionate about protecting
the Amazon region and its human inhabitants, learn
about fundraising and generating content for educa-
tional projects run by Meli in Brazil. Contingency plans
are in place should the pandemic prevent or limit the op-
portunities to work in Brazil, which include generating
content for projects while working in the UK.

Project DescriptionRound Island, Mauritius, hosts a
community of rare endemic lizard species. Their envi-
ronment was cleared of most vegetation by introduced
goats and rabbits (now eliminated). A partnership
between the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mau-
ritian Wildlife Foundation and the Government's Na-
tional Parks and Conservation Service has permitted
the restoration of habitat and with it the recovery of
the reptile-dominated vertebrate community (Cole|et
al. 2018). The reptile species occupy a landscape going
through plant community recovery, but little is known
about availability of the invertebrate prey. The skinksNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 15
and geckos have proved to be remarkably resilient to
environmental change, although some species were ex-
tirpated from the island's reptile community. It is likely
the reptiles originally adapted to dierent niches, in-
cluding trophic niches that allowed them to avoid direct
competition. One species, the Telfair's skink, is a gen-
eralist, consuming a wide range of dierent taxonomic
groups. Other species may have narrower niche axes and
be more specialised. Understanding the feeding niche of
the reptiles may help explain dierences in population
recovery and guide restoration management to enhance
the success of planned reptile reintroductions.
The main aims/methods are:
§||||||Analyse the diets of the lizard species that
have survived on Round Island.|Collect lizard faecal
samples from across the island and use High Throughput
Sequencing (HTS) of plant and invertebrate DNA.
§||||||DNA barcode as many invertebrate
species on Round Island as possible|(we have already
barcoded all the plants). Invertebrates will be identied
by the student at the Natural History Museum. Once
we have the barcodes we can interpret the output from
HTS and identify who is eating what.
§||||||Analyse for prey choice and competition.
Compare what lizards are eating with available food
(Vaughan|et al. 2018) and use dietary overlap tests to
assess dietary similarity.
§||||||Analyse dierences in the abundances of
lizard and invertebrate species in dierent plant commu-
nities. Apply/develop a range of invertebrate and reptile
survey techniques. Look for areas of more advanced re-
growth of the vegetation to predict changes to the island
food web structure in the future. §||||||Analyse
the diets of reptile species that are to be reintroduced
to Round Island's reptile community.|Use prey overlap
tests to evaluate whether any of these species are likely
to compete with Round Island species.
Candidate requirements
The student would need to have a strong academic
record with expertise relevant to this project. Molecular
Ecology expertise would be ideal but is not a prereq-
uisite. Must be able to work in the eld on a rugged
tropical island for extended periods and also be good in
the lab. Possession of a clean driving licence would be
an advantage for accessing mainland sites on Mauritius.

CommunityEcolEvolution
PhD studentship in Community Ecology & Evolution
We invite prospective candidates for a four-year fully
funded PhD Studentship to explore exciting questions
on the interface of community ecology and population
genetics. How do species coexist in diverse communities?
And how is genetic variation maintained within popula-
tions? These processes are typically studied separately,
but likely interact to structure diversity in ecological
communities. For example, rapid evolution is likely to
have a key role in determining species coexistence.
To address these questions, our collaborative project
utilizes a novel experimental community model system
of wild Drosophila species and their parasitoids from
tropical Australia. We are able to perform multigen-
erational laboratory microcosm experiments and track
eco-evolutionary dynamics in ne detail. The candidate
will conduct laboratory experiments on eco-evolutionary
dynamics of communities, eco-evolutionary modelling,
and will be involved in obtaining live Drosophila and
parasitoid lines in Australia (likely to be possible in 2022
or 2023). There will also be opportunities to develop the
project in a direction of the candidate's own choosing.
The successful applicant will join the Laboratory of
Experimental Ecology [ http://lab.hrcek.net ] at the Bi-
ology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ceske Bude-
jovice, Czech Republic, under the supervision of Dr16 EvolDir November 1, 2021
Jan Hrcek. The laboratory is a multinational team of
postdocs, PhD students and technicians and the ap-
plicant will have the opportunity to work extensively
with other team members. The laboratory obtained
prestigious high-level funding for ve years from 2020
to 2025 (ERC-CZ grant) and therefore can provide sub-
stantial resources and support for exceptional research.
The laboratory is part of the Department of Ecology, a
dynamic international centre for research on interaction
networks.
Together with the PhD student we will choose a
co-supervisor from current international collabora-
tors (listed at the bottom of [ http://lab.hrcek.net/-
people.html ] page) or start new collaborations. The
position will include a research stay abroad.
The deadline for applications is 1st December 2021. The
position can start from February 2022 onwards. Inter-
ested candidates who could only start in autumn 2022
are also encouraged to get in touch. The student will re-
ceive a salary which comfortably covers living expenses
in the Czech Republic. The working language is English
and applicants from all countries are eligible. A MSc
degree is required to enter PhD in Czech Republic. We
are looking for candidates with some of the following:
- Research experience with laboratory experiments, in-
sect ecology or molecular ecology - Experience in eco-
evolutionary dynamics or population genetic modelling
- Experience with population genetics - Driving licence
and eldwork experience

DrexelU AntAphidMicrobiomes
The Russell Lab at Drexel University seeks strongly
motivated and intellectually engaged Ph.D candidates
to join them in the Department of Biology for the Fall
of 2022. Preferred, but not required, is background
experience in molecular ecology, genomics, evolutionary
biology, or entomology. Students with interests in so-
cial justice and environmental sustainability are highly
preferred.
Successful recruits will be joining a lab that strives to
support minoritized groups in the sciences, and one that
regularly engages in readings, discussions, and improvedadvising practices steeped in the realms of Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion. We aim to train students who
will apply these practices in their future mentoring. Em-
phasis is also placed on eective science communication,
eective and fair collaboration, and the development of
critical-thinking skills in addition to bench, eld, and
computational toolkits. Our current lab roster includes
8 undergraduates, 4 PhD students, and 1 postdoctoral
fellow, providing a critical mass for our strong intellec-
tual and socially conscious culture, along with numerous
opportunities for collaboration and the development of
mentoring skills.
For their research, students will work on one of two
systems: 1. A 46-million year old nutritional symbio-
sis between Cephalotes turtle ants and their symbiotic
gut bacteria. 2. Symbioses between pea aphids and
protective bacteria.
Research in both system uses genomic tools to under-
stand symbiont function, diversity, and evolution. Both
systems are amenable to lab experimentation, and op-
portunities exist for local and semi-long-distance eld
research to collect host insects and ecological metadata
from the surrounding habitat.
Dissertation research on the ant system may be focused
on elucidating symbiont function and evolutionary his-
tory, while that on the pea aphid may focus on sym-
bionts' protective roles - against parasitoids or high
temperatures. Alternative projects, available in both
systems, may include studies on within-host symbiont
interactions and their capacities to structure symbiotic
communities. Genomics, bioinformatics, PCR screening,
phylogenetics, FISH microscopy, and live insect manip-
ulations will be among the tools utilized for these lines
of research. All are supported by strong lab/university
infrastructure and opportunities for training at Drexel
and beyond.
Collaborators on both projects come from Drexel and
other renowned academic institutions, providing access
to a wide network with diverse expertise. Through the
PI's secondary appointment with Drexel's Biodiversity,
Earth, and Environmental Sciences department, stu-
dents will gain access to an even broader professional
pool. Like our collaborators, and our peers in Biology,
these BEES colleagues bring with them a variety of
interests in the areas of social justice, sustainability,
climate change, science, and leisure.
All inquiries should be directed to Professor Jacob Rus-
sell at jar337@drexel.edu and should include a brief
statement of interest and a CV.

SplicingNetworkEvolution
Therapies for many potentially treatable genetic diseases
remain out of touch because we still don't have a full pic-
ture of how genes are regulated dierently between cells
and tissues. Many genes, including some directly asso-
ciated with traits and disorders, are widely expressed
across cells and tissues, leading to potential unwanted
secondary eects if blindly targeted with medications.
However, nearly all genes in humans undergo alternative
splicing, the process through which dierent transcripts
are generated from a single gene.
Recent work by us and others demonstrated that alter-
natively spliced transcripts arising from many of these
genes tend to have a much more specic expression,
opening the opportunity to identify specic isoforms
as potential targets for drug development. To further
the identication of isoforms of interest it is becoming
increasingly important to fully characterise their regula-
tion through the reconstruction of regulatory networks
integrating splicing information in relevant tissues.
We oer a highly collaborative PhD project between the
Haerty (bioinformatics) Macaulay (molecular biology,
technology development), and Tunbridge (neurobiol-
ogy, target identication) groups. The main aim of the
project is to develop approaches to reconstruct regu-
latory networks at the transcript level in the human
brain, assess the transcript regulation for candidate
genes, and assess the impact of genetic variation on
transcript regulation.
The student will work in a rapidly developing eld and
gain unique expertise in computational biology, large
dataset analysis, genomics, transcriptomics, sequencingtechnologies, molecular biology, technology development,
and therapeutic target identication.
The project will be conducted at the Earlham Institute,
a UKRI-BBSRC research centre of excellence for bioin-
formatics and sequencing technology development, in
close collaboration with scientists at the University of
Oxford. The student will have access to training and
career development opportunities at EI and on the Nor-
wich Research Park as part of the Norwich Biosciences
Doctoral Training Partnership.

Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany Open PhD posi-
tion: Resistance and tolerance in persistent infections
Application deadline: 8th November 2021
The Evolution and Ecology of Insect Defences group at
the Institute of Biology, Freie Universitaet (FU) Berlin,
Germany, would like to invite applications for a German
Research Foundation (DFG) funded doctoral candidate
position (TV-L E13, 65%) for the research project: \Re-
sistance and tolerance in persistent infections". The
position is xed-term and available for 3 years and it
will start as soon as possible.
Project background Our research lies in the eld of
eco-evo-immunology, focusing on host resistance and
tolerance to infection (https://armitagelab.com/). A
host can counteract an infection by directly reduc-
ing its pathogen load, i.e., resistance, or by reduc-
ing the harm that the infection does to its tness,
i.e., tolerance (reviewed in Kutzer & Armitage, doi:
10.1016/j.zool.2016.05.011). Given that resistance can
be costly and involve autoimmune damage, a more re-
sistant host is not always the ttest. Tolerance on the
other hand. describes how well hosts are able to deal
with the tness costs of a given pathogen load. Resis-
tance and tolerance are predicted to give contrasting
perspectives on host-pathogen evolution and infectious
diseases, therefore it is important to understand infec-
tion in the light of these two concepts. In our group we
focus on resistance and tolerance to bacterial infections
in insects. Such infections are dynamic and, similarly
to the case in humans, can persist for up to a lifetime
(Acu na Hidalgo et al, doi: 10.1101/2021.03.29.437521).
The project will build on our previous work and involve
studying the interaction between the host (Drosophila
melanogaster) and bacterial pathogens over the course
of the infection process. The aims are to understand
more about bacterial persistence, the host and pathogen
responses during persistent infections, and resistance
and tolerance along the trajectory of the infection pro-
cess. Approaches will include, e.g., genetic modicationNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 19
of bacteria, bacterial infection of ies, microscopy, pro-
teomics of host responses to infection, and host tness
analyses.
Berlin has a dynamic research environment, and the
Freie Universitaet Berlin has a number of other re-
searchers with an interest in insect infection biology,
and with whom we intensively interact. Furthermore,
there is the possibility to join a graduate programme in
biodiversity, evolution and ecology. Please contact So-
phie Armitage (sophie.armitage@fu-berlin.de) with any
questions or for further information about the project.

ration based at 5 institutions in the US (listed below).
This project will study growth, survivorship, and im-
mune responses of multiple buttery species to dierent
temperature proles and variable host plant sources.
Field and laboratory approaches (including rearing, pop-
ulation genetics, and gene expression) will study select
buttery populations throughout their range to under-
stand local adaptations and evolutionary potential. We
will use these mechanistic data to build dynamic models
to project species' responses to climate change. Pre-
dictions of emerging models of large-scale population
and range dynamics will be tested with data emerging
from a network of community (citizen) science monitor-
ing platforms and programs (e.g., the North American
Buttery Counts, route-based buttery monitoring net-
works, opportunistic observations through portals like
eButtery and iNaturalist). Validated models will be
projected into future climates to explore the potential
biodiversity consequences of global change.
There is a great deal of latitude for building individual
projects and cross-lab collaborations within the scopeof this project. Limited graduate student stipends are
available in many participating labs (see below), but re-
cent or current undergrads are also encouraged to learn
more about the project and write individualized research
proposals that could be separately funded by fellowship
programs (e.g., NSF Graduate Research Fellowships,
https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). While there is no specic
funding in the project for post-docs, the goals of the
project align exactly with one current focus of NSF Post-
doctoral Fellowships in Biology (area 2), \Integrative
Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing In-
teractions Between Genomes, Environment and Pheno-
types." ( https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/-

Our project is looking to support a large and diverse
collaboration and we are particularly interested in re-
cruiting candidates who have been traditionally under-
represented in the ecological and evolutionary sciences or
who are passionate about broadening participation. As
such, we also highly encourage interested upcoming and
recent graduates who can also apply for NSF Biology

VertebrateBrainEvolution
PhD student positions (dry and wet lab): Vertebrate
brain origins and evolution
Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), Heidelberg Uni-
versity, Germany
Two PhD student positions (3 years with possible ex-
tensions) are available immediately in the evolutionary
genomics group of Henrik Kaessmann. Applications will
be reviewed until the positions are lled.
We are seeking highly qualied and enthusiastic appli-
cants with a Master degree, a keen interest in evolution-
ary questions, and a talent and passion for experimental
molecular/cellular work and/or bioinformatics analyses
(i.e., both joint and distinct dry/wet lab projects are
possible).
Our lab has been interested in a range of topics re-
lated to the origins and evolution of organs in mammals
and other vertebrates and the various underlying ge-
nomic/molecular changes (see \Selected Publications"
below). In the framework of our research, we have
generated and analyzed comprehensive genomics (e.g.,
RNA-seq, ATAC-seq) datasets based on samples from
our large organ collections. More recently, we have be-
gun to bring the work of our lab to the level of single cells
using state-of-the-art single-cell genomics technologies
and bioinformatics procedures.
The PhD student positions will be funded by a recently
awarded ERC Advanced Grant (VerteBrain - \The An-
cestral Vertebrate Brain and its Cellular DiversicationDuring Evolution"). In the framework of this grant, we
seek to unravel the molecular origins and evolution of
the vertebrate brain and its constituent substructures
and cell types. Possible projects involve the generation
and/or comparative/bioinformatics analyses of exten-
sive single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic, and spatial
transcriptomics data for key species representing all ma-
jor vertebrate lineages, ranging from jawless vertebrates,
such as the sea lamprey, to mammals, such as platypus
and human. The precise projects will be developed to-
gether with the candidates, based on their respective
interests and dry/wet lab skills.
In our lab, we attach great importance to a highly col-
laborative and positive team spirit! Indeed, we have
various \mini-teams" of dry and wet lab researchers
within the lab, who enthusiastically drive projects for-
ward in remarkable ways. We are also particularly fond
of the diverse cultural backgrounds of our lab members,
which contribute to a very enriching atmosphere.
The language of our institute is English and its members
form a highly international group. The ZMBH is located
in Heidelberg, a picturesque international city next to
the large Odenwald forest and Neckar river. The city
oers a very stimulating, diverse and collaborative re-
search environment, with the European Molecular Biol-
ogy Laboratory (EMBL), German Cancer Research Cen-
ter (DKFZ), Heidelberg Institute of Theoretical Studies
(HITS), and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Re-
search located in close proximity to the University.

KU Leuven
ModellingMicrobialEvolution
PHD POSITION IN MODELLING MICROBIAL EVO-
LUTION AT KU LEUVEN (BELGIUM)
PROJECT
We oer an interdisciplinary PhD position at the Uni-
versity of Leuven (Belgium). The research will concern
mathematical and/or computational modelling of micro-
bial evolution in changing and uncertain environments,
and will be mainly supervised by Prof Piet van den Berg
and co-supervised by Prof Jan Michiels. This set-up
ensures close supervision on the modelling part (Prof
van den Berg) but also the direct involvement of a world
class experimental evolution lab (Prof Michiels), both to
direct attention to the most relevant research questions
and to test model predictions.
Research questions include (but are not limited to):
* How do environmental change and uncertainty aect
the evolutionary response to antibiotic stress in bacte-
ria (i.e. evolution of resistance vs persistence)? * Do
dierent genetic backgrounds make some evolutionary
responses to environmental change and uncertainty more
likely than others?
The position is relatively exible - the course of the
project can to a reasonable extent be adapted to the
interests and background of the candidate.
POSITIONING WITHIN KU LEUVEN
The PhD student will be positioned in the department of
Microbial and Molecular Systems (M2S) at the Centre
of Microbial and Plant Genetics (CMPG). In addition,
there will be strong links to the Biology department,
specically the Division Ecology, Evolution and Biodi-
versity Conservation (EEBC). Research at CMPG fo-
cuses on fundamental aspects of (micro)biology and their
biotechnological applications, with active researchers in
the elds of microbial evolution and ecology, benecial
and pathogenic microbe-host interactions, antimicro-
bials, probiotics, biolms, fermentation and biofuels,
plant protection and embryogenesis. Research at EEBC
focuses on various aspects of ecology and evolution,
including socio-ecology and social evolution, aquatic
ecology and conservation, evolutionary genomics, and
plant population biology and conservation. The stu-
dent in the advertised position will mostly be studyingquestions of microbial evolution, topics that are most
directly related to research at CMPG, but much overlap
in research interests exists in the EEBC (for example,
questions revolving around adaptation to uncertain en-
vironments). Since the main supervisor (Prof. van den
Berg) is part of both these departments, the student
will be embedded in a group with researchers that work
on both sides.
ABOUT LEUVEN
The University of Leuven is a top institution, ranked
as the 5th university in the European Union (Times
Higher Education ranking) and the 1st in Europe (7th
in the world) in Reuters' ranking of the most innovative
universities. Leuven is a relatively small town boast-
ing a vibrant student scene (almost 58,000 students of
which around 10,000 international), has an attractive
city centre and many events year-round. Leuven is lo-
cated 20 minutes by train from Brussels and only 15
minutes from Brussels international airport, which has
many international connections. In addition, Brussels
is exceptionally well connected to other European hubs
by train, with direct connections to Paris (1 hour 20
minutes), Amsterdam (1 hour 50 minutes), London (2
hours), and Frankfurt (3 hours).
PROFILE
* MSc in Biology or a related eld * Experience with
theoretical modelling and/or systems biology * Capacity
for creative and critical thinking and strong motivation
to work on evolutionary questions
OFFER
Full time position, Standard Belgian PhD salary.
Three years of funding are currently secured for
this position - the student will be asked to apply
for FWO PhD funding (so has to be eligible). El-

MinnowEvolution
Graduate position: LIB in Bonn, Germany. Population
Genomics of Minnows.
The Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity
Change (LIB) was established in July 2021 as an inte-
gration of the Centre of Natural History of the Univer-
sity Hamburg (CeNak) with its Zoological, Geological-
Paleontological and Mineralogical Museums into the
Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig ' Leib-
niz Institute for Animal Biodiversity (ZFMK), Bonn.
As such, the LIB will be a foundation under public
law and a research museum of the Leibniz Association.
The LIB will contribute to biodiversity research with
its extensive collections and through its research elds
of taxonomy, morphology and molecular science. LIB
will further contribute to the conservation of global bio-
diversity, to documenting and analyzing evolutionary
and ecological biodiversity change, and engage in sci-
ence transfer activities on biodiversity change and its
potential causes.
The LIB is looking for a PhD student (f/m/d) studying
population genomics of minnows in the framework of
the Leibniz association-funded project \Hybrid swarm
evolution of native and invasive Phoxinus spp. to the
river Sieg, Germany" at the Centre for Molecular Biodi-
versity Research (ZMB)in Bonn, for the time of 3 years
as a part-time job 65%. Earliest starting at April 2022.
Project background: Species hybridisations allow the
combination of molecular and morphological characters
into novel variants and therefore have the potential to
create hybrids that can outcompete parental species.
In the River Sieg, Germany, the native minnow Phoxi-
nus phoxinus, is threatened by articial stocking prac-
tices with what was believed to be P. phoxinus from
other German drainages. Recent work, however, has
shown that these stocking populations are in fact dis-
tinct Phoxinus species: hybridisation of autochthonous
and allochthonous Phoxinus species gave rise to an in-
vader. To unravel the molecular and morphological
characteristics of Phoxinus hybrids and to shed light on
the mechanisms involved in the formation of an invader
through hybridisation, we investigate (i) the population
genomics and the genomic architecture of the Phoxinushybrid swarm for parental allele combinations, genomic
rearrangements as well as transposable element content.
(ii) We investigate the ecology and niche occupation
of the hybrid and parental species in the River Sieg
with other sh species to infer ecosystem impact of the
invader. For this purpose, we seek two PhD students:
one focusing on the genomics and another focusing on
the ecology and niche occupation of Phoxinus. Please
see companion add for the respective job descriptions.
Job description: The successful applicant will perform
comparative genomics (RAD-seq or low-coverage WGS,
and whole genome re-sequencing) to understand the role
of standing and introgressed genetic variation as well
as structural variation in the genomes of local minnow
populations. Further, we will perform yearly abundance
monitoring (approx. 20 days/year) in dierent river
systems in the larger Bonn area, which the successful
applicant is expected to support.
Your prole: The successful candidate is a creative, open-
minded, resilient individual who should hold a master's
degree in a relevant area such as but not exclusively evo-
lutionary biology, molecular biology, ecology, genomics,
bioinformatics or related elds; and have a genuine in-
terest in evolutionary biology, population dynamics, and
genome evolution. The willingness to learn new methods
is a requirement, programming skills (e.g., R, python,
workow management tools, HPC computing), whole
genome analyses and/or comparative genomics are an
asset. A good command of English is required for com-
munication with collaborators and publication of results.
German is no requirement as Bonn is an international
city. The successful candidate is expected to participate
in the yearly eld seasons in the Bonn area for sampling
and abundance monitoring.
The Leibniz Association is committed to diversity and
equal opportunities. LIB is certied as a family-friendly
institution. We aim to increase the proportion of women
in areas where women are under-represented and to pro-
mote their careers. We therefore strongly encourage
women with relevant qualications to apply.
Applications will be handled in accordance with the
Landesgleichstellungsgesetz NRW (State Equality Act).
Applications from suitable individuals with a certied se-
rious disability and those of equal status are particularly
welcome. We oer a highly motivating environment and
ability to work independently. Salary and benets are

MonashU AUS AnimalMicrobiomes
I invite applications for a PhD scholarship to investi-
gate the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping
animal microbiomes.
There is a remarkable similarity in the functional com-
position of microbiomes associated with animal hosts,
at least when analysing genes with known functions.
While some of these shared functions represent ubiqui-
tous metabolic processes essential for bacterial survival,
others are likely to be specic to animal microbiomes or
represent widely distributed functional groups. The mas-
sive metagenomic datasets of microbiomes associated
with a range of animals contain precious information
on what is the minimal genetic make-up of a healthy
animal-associated microbiome. This project proposes
to leverage the accumulated information from a range
of animal microbiomes to identify community assembly
rules and evolutionary processes acting on microbial
communities associated with metazoans. This research
will help to evaluate the transferability microbiome re-
search across animal hosts and will contribute to guiding
microbiome engineering strategies.
Ideal start date is mid 2022. Please email your interests

MicrobialPaleogenomics
A graduate position for the project entitled \Predicting
migration histories of ancient human populations using
phylogenomics of ancient commensal microbes" is now
available in the Microbial Paleogenomics at Institute
Pasteur, Paris, France.
About the Unit:
The Unit investigates how human microbes emerged,
spread and changed at the genomic level over the course
of human history, and uses this information to better
understand the complexity of modern infectious diseases
and human microbiomes. We do so by combining an-
cient DNA (using ancient human remains as sources of
DNA), deep sequencing, genomics and metagenomics,
phylogenetics, bioinformatics approaches. We closely
interact with historians and archaeologist to properly
contextualize our results.

tact nicolas.rascovan@pasteur.fr (@NRascovan on twit-
ter).
About the project:
Background - Humans and microbes have closely inter-
acted throughout the evolutionary history of our species.
Some of the microbial species that form part of the
human microbiome can be found in populations from
all continents, time periods and ecosystems. Moreover,
dierent works have shown evidence that the genomes of
certain core microbial species, and even the metagenome
of the human microbiota, could be used to trace back
migrations of individuals and populations. However, to
date, no one has systematically investigated at which ex-
tent, how far in time and how precisely these migrations
could be inferred from microbial DNA.
Goals and hypotheses - The ultimate goal of this project
is to develop new methodological and statistical ap-
proaches to estimate migration patterns of ancient hu-
man populations (e.g., timings, directions), by using
microbial genomes as a proxy. To do so, we will com-
bine ancient and modern genomic data from humansand their oral microbial species, both retrieved from the
same individuals, with samples spanning over thousands
of years and vast geographic regions. Assuming that
ancient human populations diverged from each other
together with at least some of their associated microbes,
our hypothesis is that these microbes will likely contain
phylogenetic signatures reecting the migration histo-
ries of their host populations. If so, phylogenomic and
molecular clock analyses of such species could be used
to estimate the divergence times and spread directions
between ancient human populations.
Project description - This project will be centered in
pre-Columbian populations from South America, a per-
fect model for this study because: a) we know very little
about their migration histories across the continent and
population movements over time, b) these populations
have been isolated from other continents for millennia,
thus representing a clear case to search for microbial
species that entered the continent with the founding pop-
ulations of the Americas, and those that were acquired
from the environment while they spread and c) our lab
has a large collection of data from these populations
(ancient DNA datasets -human and oral microbes- from
individuals spanning over millennia and vast geographic
regions).
The rst specic goal (AIM 1) will be to identify the
microbial species that can be consistently found across
individuals from dierent periods and regions. We will
do so by mapping raw sequencing data on a genomic
database we have generated in the lab that contains
a comprehensive collection of genomes from oral mi-
crobial species recovered from worldwide populations
and time periods. From these analyses, we expect to
recover whole genome data from species that are per-
sistently found in individuals from our collection and
other populations.
The second specic goal (AIM 2) will be to identify mi-
crobial species with similar spread histories than their
host human populations. To do so, we will rst analyze
ancient human genomes using classical human popu-
lation genetics approaches widely used in the ancient
DNA eld to reconstruct known or highly suspected
migration trajectories of these populations. We will
then use phylogenomic and molecular clock analyses
from all genomes of each microbial species collected
in the previous goal and separate those exhibiting or
not similar trends to the results obtained from human
genomes. Finally, we will develop new statistical frame-
works to collate the results from human and microbial
data. This will allow to accurately identify species that
could be used for estimating spread histories and diver-
gence times between human populations, comparably
as when using human genomes, but requiring muchNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 29

The Hines lab at The Pennsylvania State University (Bi-
ology and Entomology Depts.) is recruiting a PhD-level
graduate student to work on an NSF-funded project ex-
amining the genetic basis of mimetic color diversity and
convergence in bumble bees. The graduate student will
perform research projects examining the genetic basis
of convergent coloration across several mimetic bumble
bee lineages and track how the implicated alleles sort
across a mimetic radiation. This research will involve
eld trips to collect bees in the western United States,
genomic sequencing, and genome wide association anal-
ysis to assess the genetic targets of repeated evolution
of mimetic phenotypes across bumble bees. Students
working on these projects will obtain training in evolu-
tionary genetics/evo-devo, developmental biology, and
bioinformatics. Students must have a demonstrated pas-
sion for research, and an interest in evolutionary biology,
molecular research, and in developing expertise in bioin-
formatics. The student may pursue additional projects
related to insect evolutionary genetics/genomics, pig-
mentation, bumble bee biology and diversity, and/or
bee health for their thesis research.
The student can potentially join one of several gradu-
ate programs at PSU including: Biology (preferred for
this position), Entomology, Ecology, MCIBS, and Bioin-
formatics and Genomics programs. This opportunity
is for a funded research assistantship, however, PSU
oers several opportunities for teaching training and
student stipends can combine teaching assistantships
with research assistantships. The student for this posi-
tion would preferably be willing to start in Summer 2022
so that the student can engage in important collecting
trips, but a Fall 2022 start is possible as well.

There are astonishing dierences in whether, how, and
how long for, animals care for their ospring. In most
species, such as many marine shes, parents abandon
their fertilized eggs to their own destiny, which is mostly
being eaten by predators. Conversely, parents of other
species provide protection and resources to their o-
spring. While parental care increases ospring survival,
it also comes at considerable costs for the parents be-
cause resources and time are limited. Once evolved, not
only does care aect the tness of parents and ospring,
but it also alters life history strategies, is related to
sexual selection and mating system, leads to coopera-
tion and conict within the family, and promotes the
evolution of sociality. Yet, we know very little about
when care evolves and its knock-on eects on species re-
production, population dynamics and extinction risk.|30 EvolDir November 1, 2021

SandDuneArthropods
DUNArt - Diversity and Conservation of Arthropod
Communities of Sand Dunes
Open PhD position (deadline: 27.10.2021): We are
pleased to announce one PhD position in a project on
the diversity and conservation of arthropod commu-
nities of sand dunes of the Mediterranean area. The
project is available under a collaborative programme
between the Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, and the
Center for Integrative Biodiversity Discovery, Leibniz In-
stitute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science, Museum
f ur Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany. The position is for 3
years (36 months), and the student will be enrolled under
a double-degree contract between the Sapienza Univer-
sity (host university) and the University of Berlin (part-
ner university). For further information please contact:
Pierlippo Cerretti (pierlippo.cerretti@uniroma1.it)
and Rudolf Meier (Rudolf.Meier@mfn.berlin)
Project description
Background
Sand dunes are an integral and fundamental component
of well-preserved coasts, representing the narrow and
everchanging interface between terrestrial and marine
environments. These deposits mostly form where winds
tend to blow sand inland and the beach is wide enough
to allow for its accumulation. Sand beaches and dunes
harbour a unique fauna, with many species exclusive
of this environment, especially among arthropods. The
fauna of dunes faces challenging conditions, such as: lackNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 31
of soil and moisture, high insolation, strong winds, high
temperatures and salty spray, thus it is characterized
by unusual morphological adaptations or life history
strategies to cope with these challenges. Coastal sand
dunes are fragile ecosystems and are negatively aected
by anthropic disturbance and impacts, such as: sand
extraction, urban development, tourism, erosion and
spread of alien invasive species. In the near future, a
signicant danger for these already imperilled ecosys-
tems is also due to rising sea levels caused by climatic
change, which could easily lead to the destruction of the
remaining portions of this habitat. Unsurprisingly, the
UE classies coastal sand dunes as the most endangered
environment in Europe. DUNArt will focus on the ef-
fect of the disappearance of these habitats on arthropod
communities. Arthropods are a key component of terres-
trial ecosystems, besides being the most diverse group of
terrestrial animals, also comprising several dune special-
ists, making them excellent model organisms to test the
impact of anthropic activities and climatic change on
coastal sandy beaches. Arthropods themselves are on
steep decline, with cascading impacts on terrestrial com-
munities and trophic webs. The object of this project
is to document arthropod diversity on sand dunes, in-
vestigate their response to a progressively disappearing
habitat and locate potential key areas which may act
as refuges for this unique fauna.
Aims
I. Document arthropod diversity on coastal sand dunes
through dedicated samplings, testing the overall state
of knowledge of arthropod fauna in these environments
around the Mediterranean basin. II. Set up a geolocal-
ized database of dune associated arthropods with an
emphasis on Mediterranean and Italian species and se-
lecting key- groups of herbivores, predators, parasitoids
and pollinators. III. Test and model the response of
insect groups to environmental changes, predicting the
eect of these impacts on their future distribution and,
ultimately survival. IV. Predict which traits make tax-
onomic and functional insect groups more susceptible
to environmental changes. V. Pinpoint potential key
conservation areas for dune-associated arthropods.
Description of the project, methodology and experimen-
tal design
Key taxonomic groups. The project will focus on
selected key arthropod groups representing dierent
trophic guilds, showing dierent adaptations and zona-
tion to dune environment. A priority will be given to
arthropod groups which are better known from a tax-
onomic and natural history point of view, maximizing
their predictive potential in the analysis. In particu-
lar, the project will focus on dune associated speciesof talitrids (Amphipoda Talitridae), sowbugs (Isopoda
Onyscidea), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), sphecoid wasps
(Hymenoptera Apoidea), ground beetles (Coleoptera
Carabidae), antlions (Neuroptera Myrmeleontidae),
butteries (Lepidoptera Papilionoidea), sphaerocerids
(Diptera Sphaeroceridae) and bristle ies (Diptera Ta-
chinidae), encompassing a broad range of trophic guilds
from phytophages to predators/parasitoids and pollina-
tors (though the representatives of each group may ll
up dierent ecological roles).
Experimental scale. European and North African
Mediterranean shores, with a particular emphasis on
the Italian peninsula and islands.
Methodology and design of the main goals.
I. Dedicated and standardised eld samplings will be
carried out in selected sand dunes of the Mediterranea
basin through Malaise,

ology of early-diverging animal groups  >1
2\ cnidarians
(sea anemone and jellysh) in particular. Current NSF-
funded research projects in the lab use the sea anemone
Nematostella vectensis to investigate 1) the mechanism
by which a single transcription factor controls distinct
sets of target genes in dierent neural cell types, and 2)
the mechanism by which neuropeptides modulate the
timing of life cycle transition. Students may work on
these and related problems in neuro-evo-devo. Student's
specic project will be developed based on the student's
research interests and educational background, in con-
sultation with the PI of the lab. Research projects may
involve gene expression analyses (e.g. in situ hybridiza-
tion and immunohistochemistry), reverse genetics (e.g.
CRISPR-Cas9), embryology (e.g. descriptive morphol-
ogy, cell-lineage tracing and tissue transplantation), ge-
nomics (e.g. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq), and/or advanced
microscopy (confocal and electron microscopy, and live-
cell imaging). Research and teaching assistantships are
available.

We are seeking an enthusiastic PhD student to work on
the evolution of regulatory control of bacterial antiviral

PhD Project: Determining the regulatory control of
prokaryotic antiviral defence systems
The spread of antimicrobial resistance is a slow-moving
pandemic that has been identied by the WHO as one
of the top 10 threats facing humanity. It has been es-
timated that in 2050 approximately 10 million people
will die each year as a result of antimicrobial resistance.
Bacterial immune systems are key determinants of the
spread of antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, they can
severely hamper the ecacy of therapeutic application
of phages in clinical settings, which is considered a viable
alternative to conventional antibiotics to treat infectionswith resistant pathogens. For these reasons it is critical
to identify bacterial defence systems and to understand
how they operate.
Recent work has revealed that bacteria carry many more
defences than previously thought, and we are only just
beginning to understand how they work. In this project,
the student will study the interplay between a novel
defence system that was identied in the Westra lab
and the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system of the
important opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa. This WHO priority pathogen is one of the leading
causes of hospital acquired infections and a major cause
of lung infections in cystic brosis patients. Because of
its high levels of antimicrobial resistance, phage therapy
is in some cases already being used to treat patients.
The project will benet from expertise in evolution
of novel regulatory and genetic innovations (Taylor,
Bath), P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas evolution and discov-
ery of the novel immune system (Westra, Exeter), and
modelling the coevolution of host and parasite interac-
tions (Ashby, Bath). Throughout this interdisciplinary
project, the student will receive extensive training in
experimental evolution, molecular microbiology, genet-
ics and modelling. The student will be based in the
Taylor lab as part of the Milner Centre for Evolution
at the University of Bath with opportunities to work in
the Westra lab at the Environment and Sustainability
Institute at the Cornwall campus of the University of
Exeter, and with the Ashby lab in the Department of
Maths at the University of Bath.
Location: This project will be conducted under the di-
rect supervision of Dr Tiany Taylor with co-supervision
from Prof Edze Westra. Based primarily at the Depart-
ment of Biology and Biochemistry at the University
of Bath (UK) in the new Milner Centre for Evolu-
tion (http://www.bath.ac.uk/groups/milner-centre-for-
evolution/). The Milner Centre is a new research centre
focused on doing ground breaking research that ad-
dresses major questions in evolutionary biology. There
will also be some time spent in the Westra lab at the
Univesity of Exeter's ESI in Cornwall (UK) (http:/-
/www.exeter.ac.uk/esi/). The University of Exeter's
Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) is an
interdisciplinary centre leading cutting-edge research
into solutions to problems of environmental change.
Requirements: We are looking for a biology graduate
who has a strong interest in microbiology, molecular
biology and evolution. Applicants must have obtained,
or be about to obtain, a First or Upper Second Class
UK Honours degree, or the equivalent qualications
gained outside the UK, in an appropriate area of science
or technology. Some practical experience in microbial36 EvolDir November 1, 2021

The project:
Biological invasions are major drivers of global change
and can impact ecosystem functioning as well as hu-
man food security. The occurrence of such invasions is
likely to increase drastically, thereby creating an urgent
demand to better understand underlying evolutionary
aspects, such as how biological mechanisms may con-
tribute to the success and impact of an invasion. Despite
major advances in the eld, mechanisms for initial in-
vasion success and optimal strategies to foster invasion
impact are still debated. In particular, surprisingly
little attention has been paid to the roles of mating sys-
tems and reproduction in insects, even though they are
among the worst invaders globally both in ecologically
and economically terms.
We seek a highly motivated PhD student to investigate
evolution of mating and reproduction in an invasive
beetle, the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida Murray
(Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), which is a nest parasite of
bees endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Dierent selection
scenarios will be considered in the endemic range, during
transport, and after establishment in its novel ranges.
Behavioural, genetic, morphological and physiological
data for phenotypic traits will be combined across multi-
ple endemic and invasive populations. The PhD student
will be based and conduct DNA work in Switzerland
and will also work in the eld at least at three locations
(Australia, Brazil, Italy, Kenya, South Africa or USA).
The research work also includes statistical data analysis
and publication of results in international peer-reviewed
journals (N=3 papers minimum). We oer membership

European Research Council funding, with a budget of
euro 10 million over six years. In the project \From cor-
relations to explanations: towards a new European pre-
history (COREX)" geneticists and archaeologists from
the University College London (led by Mark Thomas
and Stephen Shennan) join forces with archaeologists
from Gothenburg (led by Kristian Kristiansen and Karl
G oran-Sj ogren), and geneticists from Copenhagen (led
by Kurt Kj ~Ar, Eske Willerslev and FernandoRacimo).
The project will combine prehistoric human genomic, ar-
chaeological, environmental, stable isotope and climate
data to better understand the processes that shaped our
biological and cultural past from the time of the rst
farmers to the Iron Age.
The applicant will be advised by Assoc. Prof. Fer-

ses and developing computational models to connect
population genetic processes (population expansions,
migrations and admixture), patterns of material culture
distribution (i.e. diusion of technology and art forms),
environmental factors (climate, ecozones, subsistence
strategy and the presence of pathogens), sedimentary
DNA and demographic data (such as population density
estimates from radiocarbon date density data). This
will be done using a variety of geostatistically-aware
models that account for auto-correlations in both space

UFlorida EvoBio MachineLearning
The Zhou lab in the department of biology at the Uni-
versity of Florida is seeking a highly motivated and
collaborative PhD student with interests in evolutionary
biology and machine learning.
Research in the Zhou lab is centered around the funda-
mental biological question of how genotype determines
phenotype. For example, how mutations in the amino
acid sequence of a protein aect the protein function.
Understanding the genotype-phenotype map is critical
to evolutionary biology as well as many other elds in-
cluding medicine and bioengineering. Our lab tackles
this problem through a combination of modern ma-
chine learning technology and high-throughput wet lab
experiments. Our lab is part of a large campus-wide
initiative to integrate AI-based approaches into research
and teaching.
This PhD position is sponsored by the Biology de-
partment graduate program at UF and will be funded
through an initial two years of research assistantship
followed by a combination of RA/TAships.
Project overview A fundamental question in biology is
how the genotypes of an organism determine its various
phenotypes. For example, the amino acid sequence of
a protein determines its 3D structures, which in turn
denes its function. Any mutations in the sequence can
lead to changes in the function of the protein.
This mapping from sequence to phenotype and to t-
ness is critical to evolutionary biology as it determines
the tempo and mode of adaptive evolution. It also has
many real-world applications, including predicting the
evolution of antimicrobial resistance, predicting disease
phenotype from genomics data, and engineering highly
optimized biomolecules.
The overarching goal of the lab is to integrate machine
learning and high-throughput experiments to reveal both
local and global structures of the tness landscapes of
proteins and complex traits and extract general princi-
ples of adaptive evolution.
We are developing various machine learning methods
for experimental (labeled) as well as evolutionary (un-
labeled) data to interrogate the structure of genotype-
phenotype maps. Current research projects encompass
supervised methods such as Gaussian processes and un-
supervised methods including language and generativemodels.
We also use wet lab experiments to empirically measure
the genotype-phenotype map for proteins as well as com-
plex traits. This project will apply massively parallel
reporting assays to budding yeast and have a special
focus on how mutations interact to aect tness.
Job description This PhD position will focus on un-
derstanding the genotype-phenotype mapping through
high-throughput experiments on budding yeast. The

The Integrated Biology Graduate Program (iBio) at
the University of Iowa is actively recruiting motivated
students to join a diverse Biology Department and work
on exciting problems in the eld of evolutionary biology.
The iBio program highlights the uniqueness of our de-
partmental research, which integrates multiple organiza-
tional levels, from the molecular to the ecological, as well
as multiple scales of biological time, from embryogenesis
to aging to phylogenetic analyses, in a wide array of ex-
perimental organisms. Key areas of strength in the eld
of evolutionary genetics include: the molecular evolution
of meiosis and of speciation, the molecular genetics of
sexual reproduction, speciation genetics, evolution of
developmental networks and stress responses, molecular
causes and evolutionary consequences of recombination
variation.
In addition to the broad range of research we can oer
to our students, our focus on basic biological questions,
as well as on high-quality writing and teaching, provides
a rm foundation necessary for students to take the
next steps in their careers, whether these are in basic
or disease-centered academic research or in other areas
of science. In this regard, iBio represents a departure
from many traditional programs because our aim is to
produce well-rounded scientists who excel in research
and are prepared to become the next generation of gifted42 EvolDir November 1, 2021

UJyvaskyla SexualSelectionTheory
Doctoral Researcher, Evolutionary Biology
Applications are invited for a 4-year fully funded PhD
position to study sexual selection at the University of
Jyvaskyla in Finnish Lakeland.
Does selection act dierently on the two sexes? Are
there universal dierences we should expect to see be-
tween females and males, based on scientic principles
and the most fundamental, denitional properties of
the sexes alone? These questions date back to the days
of Charles Darwin but are widely debated to this day.
This PhD project will address the above topics usingmathematical modelling and literature reviews, super-
vised by Assistant Professor Jussi Lehtonen. The results
will help us identify and understand the fundamental
evolutionary mechanisms driving sex-specic selection
and sexual dimorphism.
Jyvaskyla is a mid-sized city in Finnish Lakeland, sur-
rounded by beautiful nature, countless lakes, nature
trails, and national parks. It is also known as the 'capital
of sport' with excellent opportunities for both summer
and winter outdoor activities. Jyvaskyla is a relatively
aordable city and university students form a large part
of the population, bringing a lively atmosphere with
them.
The Department of Biological and Environmental Sci-
ence at the University of Jyvaskyla hosts expertise in
empirical as well as theoretical evolutionary biology,
including sexual selection.

rial endosymbionts that confer a variety of phenotypic
eects on their hosts. We are seeking a *graduate re-
search assistant* to conduct research on symbiont in-
teractions in a species of Linyphiid spider, *Mermessus
fradeorum*. This spider is infected by up to 5 dierent
strains of inherited symbiont, which result in dierent
reproductive anomalies for the host depending on which
combination of symbionts are present. A newly *NSF
funded, 4-year research project* will explore the inter-
face between symbiont interactions within a host, and
interactions among dierentially infected spiders in the
population. This project is a collaboration among Dr.

Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
*The Position* We are looking for a *student to be
co-supervised* by Dr. Van Cleve and Dr. White, who
will *focus on computational and evolutionary models
of symbiont and host dynamics*, as well as empirical
studies of spider phenotype, population dynamics, and
evolutionary trajectory. The assistantship will include
an annual salary stipend, graduate tuition waiver, and
student health benets. Selection criteria will include
1) experience/interest in computational modeling, 2)
previous entomological or ecological research experience,
and 3) experience with basic molecular techniques such
as PCR and gel electrophoresis.
*The Location* We are at the University of Kentucky,
in Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington is a mid-sized city
of~300,000 people, within a 1.5 hr drive from both
Cincinnati, OH and Louisville, KY. We are also less
than an hour from *great hiking, camping, and climbing
in the Red River Gorge*.
*The Process* Please contact Dr. Jen White at je-
nawhite@uky.edu or Dr. Jeremy Van Cleve at jvan-
cleve@uky.edu for more information and include a let-
ter of interest, unocial transcript, and CV/resume.
Prospective students will then be referred to apply to the

*** Fully funded 3.5 year PhD position, start Sept 2022
***
The project
Explaining the spectacular diversity of life is one of the
greatest challenges in biology. A particularly striking
component of this diversity concerns the diverse array
of sexual signalling traits found in nature, such as colour
patterns, songs and behaviours. Such traits represent
the outcome of the interplay between natural and sexual
selection, and the evolution of sexual signalling traits
and preferences has long been recognised as a poten-
tially powerful mechanism for triggering reproductive
isolation and speciation among diverging populations.
However, despite much historical focus, only now are we
in a position to unpick the evolutionary forces shaping
the huge diversity of sexual signalling traits found in
nature and to decipher their role in driving speciation
and patterns of species richness at global scales.
Focusing on the diverse global radiation of birds
(>10,000 species), this project will make use of un-
paralleled datasets of plumage colouration and song
structure for thousands of bird species with cutting-edge
phylogenetic comparative methods to answer unresolved
questions at the core of evolutionary research. Possible
research directions include examining how sexual, social
and ecological conditions combine to shape the evolu-
tion of sexual signalling traits, and testing the role ofsexual signal evolution in speciation and the build-up
of community species richness.
The successful applicant will have the opportunity to
work with premier global natural history museum col-
lections (e.g. NHM Tring) and will acquire advanced
statistical, computational and communication skills that
are highly transferable. In addition, there is scope within
the PhD to develop eldwork-based projects related to
these topics in various international locations.
The result will be a comprehensive assessment of the
drivers of sexual signal evolution and its role in avian
speciation processes. It is anticipated that the work will
result in several important publications.
The team
The PhD student will be embedded within Dr Chris
Cooney's lab (www.cooneylab.co.uk) in the School of
Biosciences at the University of Sheeld. The PhD
project is part of an ongoing collaboration with Dr
Gavin Thomas (University of Sheeld) and it is antic-
ipated that the successful applicant will work closely
with both supervisors and their respective collaborators
around the world.
We encourage applications from candidates from all
backgrounds with broad interests in ecology and evolu-
tion. ***Informal enquiries are strongly welcomed and
encouraged.*** If you are interested, please contact Dr
Chris Cooney at c.cooney@sheeld.ac.uk.

USheeld EvolutionaryGenomics
*** Fully funded 3.5 year PhD position ***
Life on Earth is facing unprecedented challenges as a
result of climate change. Understanding how organisms
rapidly adapt to their environment is essential in not
only reducing the number of species that will go extinct,
but also in safeguarding future food production. Adap-
tation requires genetic variation for natural selection to
act on. This project will focus on the processes that re-
sult in genes present in some individuals but not others
from the same species, and ultimately how this variation
impacts adaptation.
As part of this project, the student will combine cutting-
edge genomic techniques, comparative analyses and ex-
perimental approaches to study two contributors ofintra-specic gene content variation; [1] lateral gene
transfer (LGT) and [2] extrachromosomal circular DNA
(eccDNA). LGT can enable organisms to evolve beyond
their innate capability by borrowing genetic information
from distant relatives, and eccDNA can act as a vehicle
for evolutionary change based on lifetime experience.
The student will use the grass family as a model system,
a key group of plants that cover 30-40% of the Earth's
terrestrial surface and produce a majority of our food.
The student will receive training in a broad range of
skills (including eldwork in the UK and abroad, molec-
ular ecology laboratory techniques, and genomics), with
the exact focus of the project being exible so that it
can be tailored to the students interests.

USheeld PhD
EvolutionaryGenomics
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD
student to study the evolution and genomics of sexual
dimorphism across birds.
The evolution and genomics of sexual phenotypes
Deadline for applying: 14th Jan 2022
Lead supervisor: Dr Alison Wright, University of
Sheeld Co-supervisors: Prof Jon Slate (University of
Sheeld), Prof Steve Paterson (University of Liverpool)
The Project
Sexual dimorphism is one of the most conspicuous
sources of biodiversity and can be observed across a
range of phenotypes, including morphology, life history
and behaviour. Understanding the genetics and evolu-
tion of sex dierences are therefore key goals in biology.
This project will test how the sexual genome evolves
and develops using next-generation sequencing data and
birds as a model system. Birds are an ideal system to
ask these questions as they exhibit a spectacular diver-
sity of sexual dimorphisms and many species are subject
to strong sexual selection. The specic approach taken
can be tailored to the particular interests of the student
and could include studies of sex chromosomes, gene reg-
ulation, sexual selection and genome evolution. This
work would suit a highly motivated student with strong
analytical skills and an enthusiasm for evolution and
genomics. Prior experience with bioinformatics or pro-
gramming is welcomed but certainly not required. Theproject will involve computational and laboratory work,
and the successful candidate will receive high quality
training in programming, wet-lab skills and state-of-
the-art genomic techniques. Additionally, there will be
ample opportunity for the student to develop their own
research interests over the course of the project.
The Team
The PhD student will be joining a productive and col-
laborative research group in the School of Biosciences at
the University of Sheeld. There will be many opportu-
nities to collaborate with ongoing work in the lab. For
more details see www.alisonewright.co.uk. The appli-
cant will also benet from the diverse range of expertise
oered by the co-supervisors Prof Jon Slate (University
of Sheeld) and Prof Steve Paterson (University of Liv-
erpool). Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact
Dr Alison Wright for more details on the group, project
and facilities ( a.e.wright@sheeld.ac.uk).

IslandFoxEvolution
We seek to recruit a highly motivated doctoral student
to pursue dissertation research on the evolutionary his-
tory of the island fox,Urocyon littoralis. The island
fox is smaller than its progenitor, the mainland gray
fox, and includes six subspecies, each restricted to a
dierent island in Southern California's Channel Islands
due to their unique migratory history during the Ice
Age and thereafter. Extreme population crashes oc-
curred on several of the islands in the 1990s, followed
by dramatic demographic recoveries, but incomplete ge-
netic recoveries. The work will take advantage of fossils
and historical samples from museum collections, taken
before the population crashes, as well as recent samples.
The research will be part of a multidisciplinary project
(morphological, paleontological, molecular) involving col-
laboration between the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County, the Wrigley Institute for Environmental
Studies and the University of Southern California. This
is a funded project and the Ph.D. student will have ve
years of support (including tuition remission) through a
combination of RAships, TAships and fellowships.
Analyses of morphological and genetic changes can be
used to address a number of important questions. When
did the fox arrive at each island and how much migration
has there been amongst islands? Were humans (Paleo-
Indians) involved in the colonization of each island?
What is the genetic basis for the evolution of dwarsm?
Is dwarsm a result of natural selection or articial se-
lection? What morphological changes, at various levels
of bone anatomy, are associated with reduction of body
size?
Potential applicants are encouraged to contact Xiaoming

MARY
New Caledonian crows are renowned for their ability to
manufacture complex foraging tools from plant materi-
als. For example, using an elaborate sequence of actions,
they craft hooked stick tools from branching vegetation,
and employing completely dierent techniques, they cut
a variety of tool shapes from the barbed edges of screw-
pine leaves. Professor Christian Rutz's research group
has been studying the behavioural ecology of New Cale-
donian crows since 2005, focussing on seven established
study sites. Building on some of the group's recent
advances, this PhD project will provide a detailed inves-
tigation of the tool-manufacture behaviour of wild crows.
There is considerable exibility with regards to specic
study objectives, but the successful candidate is likely
to conduct both eld observations and aviary-based
experiments with temporarily captive subjects, with
excellent scope for collaboration with other group mem-
bers and external project partners. This fully-funded
PhD project oers exciting opportunities for a highly
motivated student to join a dynamic research group, to
conduct topical research on the behavioural ecology of
one of the most accomplished non-human tool users, and
to receive training in state-of-the-art eld-ornithologicalNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 53

UStAndrews SocialEvolutionTheory
PhD positionjSocial evolution: cooperation and con-
ict between genes, individuals and groups (University
of St Andrews, Scotland).
Natural selection explains the appearance of design in
the living world. But at what level is this design ex-
pected to manifest - gene, individual or group - and
what is its function? Social evolution provides a window
on this problem, because it is in the context of social54 EvolDir November 1, 2021
interaction that the interests of genes, individuals and
groups come into conict with each other.
I invite applications for a PhD studentship in my re-
search group at the School of Biology, University of
St Andrews, Scotland, to develop new theory on the
topic of social evolution. The project will suit a Biology
graduate with a strong interest in social evolution, but
applications from graduates with other backgrounds are
also encouraged, and although prior experience in math-
ematical modelling would be helpful this is certainly not
required as the requisite training will be provided.
Current research in my lab involves development of gen-
eral theory - using kin selection, multilevel selection,
game theory and theoretical population genetics ap-
proaches - as well as more specic mathematical and
computer simulation models that are tailored to the bi-
ology of particular organisms, from microbes to insects
to humans. Much of our ongoing work is focused on in-
tragenomic conicts and associated clinical pathologies,
plus the role of sex and gender in social evolution
If evolutionary biology really fascinates you, and you
are a careful thinker, then you will ourish in the kind
of project that I enjoy supervising. Please direct infor-
mal enquiries to Prof Andy Gardner (andy.gardner@st-
andrews.ac.uk).

UToulouse PalmEvolution
Jonathan Rolland jCNRS researcher at the University
of Toulouse 3jhttps://jorolland.wordpress.com The
link between micro- and macro-evolution of Geonoma
Palms in the Neotropics.
Since the development of the synthetic theory of evolu-
tion (Huxley 1942), researchers in the eld of evolution-
ary biology have mainly worked on two dierent time
scales: microevolution, i.e. the evolution of populations
below the species level (such as population genetics, phy-
logeography and quantitative genetics), and macroevo-
lution, i.e. the evolution of species or clades to a higher
taxonomic level (such as phylogenetics, paleobiology56 EvolDir November 1, 2021
and biogeography).
Our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms from
micro to macroevolution is limited by the fact that there
are few studies integrating dierent time scales (Uyeda
et al. 2011, Rolland et al. 2018).
Do factors important for the dierentiation/divergence
among populations also act on the divergence between
species? The internship aims to answer this question
with unique data. Datasets encompassing both mi-
cro and macro-evolutionary timescales are particularly
scarce (Rolland et al. 2018), as large numbers of individ-
uals need to be sampled at the population level and at
the species level. In collaboration with N. Salamin, we
sequenced ~4,000 regions of nuclear DNA for more than
800 individuals in 53 species of Geonoma palms on an
altitudinal gradient ranging from sea level to over 3,000
m in the rainforests of Central and South America. For
these data, the trainee will calculate the genetic distance
for each gene between each pair of individuals (e.g. using
PLINK, Purcell et al. 2007). This genetic divergence
is a continuous measurement, which does not depend
on the concept of species because it will be calculated
between individuals, between populations and between
species. It is then possible to test hypotheses on the
origin of the genetic divergence, such as the calculation
of the contribution of geographical distance (Isolation
By Distance, IBD) and environmental factors (Isolation
by Environment, IBE) to the genetic divergence. The
geographic distances will be calculated directly on the
map with GIS softwares, and the environmental climate
will be extracted for each occurrence using data from
Worldclim (Hijmans et al. 2005). This method has al-
ready been used on Caribbean anolis lizards (Wang et al.
2013). The internship will build on work already carried
out on Geonoma (Loiseau et al. 2019). Other main
collaborator of the project: Nicolas Salamin (UNIL,
Switzerland).

PhD Student- The evolution of sexual conict We oer
a fully funded 3+1 yr PhD position starting ca. July-
August 2022; meaning that, if the PhD is nished in less
than 4 years, the student can transfer to a junior post
doc position for the remaining time. We are looking for
a PhD student interested in studying the evolutionary
factors modulating the intensity of male-male competi-
tion and sexual conict, and its consequences in terms of
population viability. Strong sexual selection can improve
population viability and evolvability through processes
such as genic capture. However, strong sexual selection
will also often give rise to sexual conict and female
harm, which does not only tend to deviate females from
their evolutionary optima, but can drastically aect
population viability, leading to a \reproductive tragedy
of the commons". We are interested in understanding
what factors modulate the evolution of male-male com-
petition, female harm levels, and sexual conict at large,
and how this all feeds back into population viability andNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 57

UWaikato 2 PopGenomics
Bioinformatics
Hi evoldir,
I have two exciting PhD positions available in my lab
at the University of Waikato (New Zealand). One is on
biocontrol, the other is on Antarctic mosses, as outlined
below. To apply for either of these opportunities to
do exciting, cutting-edge research with real-world ap-
plications, please send an interest statement and CV
to amcgaugh@waikato.ac.nz by 30 November 2021. En-
quiries at the same email address are welcome.
CONTROLLING DAMAGING INVASIVE PESTS BY
LEARNING FROM SUCCESSFUL BIOCONTROL
New Zealand's primary production and conservation
estates are threatened by invasive species. Biocontrol
can be an eective, pesticide-free, non-GMO method of
controlling damaging invasive pests, but new biocontrol
agents are often ineective. We need to be able to better
predict when they will work well before we release them
to be sure that we are not introducing new damagingspecies.
Our project leverages a remarkable 35-year experiment
on a parasitoid wasp biocontrol agent (to target the
Argentine stem weevil, pictured left; Image: Simon
Hinkley, Ken Walker; Museums Victoria) to identify
hologenomic factors associated with biocontrol success
and failure. We will also use this information to predict
the eectiveness of biocontrol agents that are slated for
release in New Zealand, thus improving existing bio-
control systems, reducing uncertainty around proposed
systems, and ensuring that eective methods are avail-
able to control future pests without increasing pesticide
use.
This project is fully-funded by MBIE (Smart Ideas
programme) and we are now seeking a PhD applicant
with skills in population genomics and/or bioinformat-
ics. The successful applicant will be based at the Uni-
versity of Waikato under the Chief Supervision of Dr.
Ang McGaughran, and will work together with the
project team (Prof Peter Dearden, University of Otago;
Mr Mark McNeill, AgResearch; Prof Stephen Goldson,
AgResearch/Lincoln University). The main focus of the
PhD will be population hologenomics and the position
will involve spending time in the Dearden lab at Otago.
HOW ISOLATED IS ANTARCTICA? ASSESSING
PAST AND PRESENT PLANT COLONISATIONS
Antarctica has long been considered biologically iso-
lated from the rest of the world. Encircled by the enor-
mous Southern Ocean ?>` home to some of the world's
strongest oceanic and atmospheric currents ??" and
with a harsh, cold climate, the continent should be pro-
tected from natural incursions of non-native plants and
animals. However, the development of molecular tech-
niques in recent decades has revolutionised our capacity
to test for past dispersal events, and emerging data
demonstrates that natural incursions into Antarctica by
terrestrial species have occurred; the Southern Ocean is
therefore not the impenetrable barrier to dispersal that
it is often thought to be.
The project aims to discover how, when, and where
natural colonisations of the Antarctic continent have
occurred, focusing on mosses - the dominant Antarctic
plant group. Cutting-edge genomic tools will be com-
bined with environmental, spatial, and ecological data
to assess mechanisms and directions of dispersal to and
around Antarctica, and to predict areas most likely to
be colonised in the future. The research will help us
understand the processes underpinning evolution and
diversity of Antarctic species, and the vulnerability and
adaptability of their ecosystems. Such knowledge is
critical for Antarctic conservation in the face of rapid
environmental change.58 EvolDir November 1, 2021
We have generated next generation sequencing data
from museum specimens of Antarctic moss and are
seeking a PhD applicant with skills in population
genomics and/or bioinformatics - especially the analysis
of exon capture data - to work on the outlined
topic. The successful applicant will be based at the
University of Waikato under the Chief Supervision
of Dr. Ang McGaughran, and will be co-supervised
by Assoc. Prof. Crid Fraser (University of Otago).
There will be opportunities to spend time in the
Fraser lab and to participate in eldwork (e.g., in
locations such as New Zealand, South America,
Australia, sub-Antarctic) to augment the existing
data with fresh collections and/or new locations.
The chosen applicant will need to be successful in
an application for a University of Waikato Doctoral

GBIF Secretariat seeks applications from individuals or
institutions that can improve the quality and usability of
GBIF-mediated data in cloud-computing environments.
With funding through a grant from the GEO-Microsoft
Planetary Computer Programme, the selected contrac-
tor will implement protocols for analysing phylogenetic
diversity on the Microsoft (MS) Azure environment us-
ing Biodiverse software, occurrence data from the GBIF
network, and phylogenies from OpenTree of Life (OToL).
The GBIF Secretariat will lead the project with the
support of Shawn Laan (Biodiverse software jUniver-
sity of New South Wales) and Emily Jane McTavishNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 63

Background and scope of work
In May 2021, GBIF began placing monthly snapshots
of GBIF occurrences in the Microsoft Azure Data Cat-
alogue. The contracted individual or institution will
extend this work, rst by implementing Biodiverse soft-
ware in MS Azure and then developing and assessing the
quality of data-ltering pipelines for the GBIF-mediated
occurrence data in the Microsoft Azure Data Catalogue.
The ltered subset of data will then be name-matched
with the latest Open Tree of Life phylogeny, produc-
ing spatially explicit phylogenetic diversity products
for analysing various clades and geographic areas. The
PDTF will help assess the quality of the resulting data
products.
The goal of the project is to generate automated monthly
data products suitable for use in research on phyloge-
netic diversity by the end of the grant period.
Primary tasks include:
- Preparing workows for ltering GBIF-mediated data -
Assessing the quality of ltered data - Matching names
between OToL and GBIF-mediated data - Running and
assessing metrics on phylogenetic diversity that inte-

analysis of a large clade
The selected candidate is expected to carry out the
work remotely or at their host institution. Candidates
must show the ability to work independently and meet
virtually with project leads on three continents.
Preferred skills and experience
The incumbent should possess outstanding bioinformat-
ics skills, good knowledge of GBIF-mediated data and
an understanding of cloud computing and phylogenetic

and spatially explicit biodiversity analyses - Experi-
ence in cloud-based or distributed computing systems
- Advanced degree in a eld relevant to biodiversity or
informatics or GBIF's work, or equivalent experience -
Full professional prociency in English - Demonstratedexperience in writing scientic publications - Ability to
work remotely with limited supervision
This is an exciting opportunity for the right individ-
ual to strengthen cloud-based biodiversity informatic
skills while working with a global data infrastructure.
The contract is open to any professional stage from
graduate student/postdoc to a sabbatical scientist. If
your motivation, interests and experience match these
requirements, we look forward to hearing from you.
Remuneration
Payment for the contract will be US $60,000, with its
term length dependent on the experience of the contrac-
tor and meeting project deliverables. The contract and
deliverables must be completed in one year.

The laboratories of Trudy Mackay and Robert Anholt

invite applications for a Drosophila Research Technician
to support NIH funded research. The world's population
is rapidly growing older, with a concomitant decrease in
physical function of older individuals. Pharmacological
inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
is an eective therapy in improving age-related impair-
ment of physical function and is a potential strategy
to slow human aging, but there is variation in improve-
ment of physical performance following ACE inhibition
that is likely due to genetic variation. This research
will identify novel genes, pathways, and mechanisms
that contribute to the benecial eects of angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor therapy on age-related de-
cline in physical mobility, one of the most debilitating
eects of aging. Ideally, the successful applicant will

*Position* *Lecturer in Ecology, Evolution and Environ-
mental Biology; Director of M.A. Program * Columbia
University in the City of New York: Arts and Sciences
Core - Academic: Department of Ecology, Evolution
and Environmental Biology
*Description*
Columbia University invites applications for a Lecturer
in Discipline position in the Department of Ecology,
Evolution and Environmental Biology. E3B represents
broad interests in ecology, evolution, behavior, conserva-
tion biology, and environmental science and maintains
strong links to Columbia's Earth Institute, the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History, Wildlife Conservation
Society, New York Botanical Garden, and EcoHealth
Alliance.
We seek a scholar with a serious commitment and proven
record in teaching, advising (ideally at a graduate level),
and research. The candidate will serve as Director of
the M.A. Program (DMAP), and will teach a student
research development seminar, a core graduate conser-
vation biology course and other graduate and advanced
undergraduate courses that complement departmentaloerings. As many students have a particular interest
in conservation biology, the ability to teach in this area
is particularly valuable. The teaching load is 5 courses
per year, divided over two semesters. The DMAP will
also advise individual students about course selection,
research projects and careers.
The department's M.A. program, which is separate from
the department's Ph.D. program, includes students with
diverse backgrounds, interests and aspirations. For ex-
ample, some plan to join conservation organizations or
teach at a K-12 level, while others wish to continue in
academia and proceed to Ph.D. programs in various
areas of integrative biology. Many are interested in
gaining research experience, and the DMAP plays an
essential role in linking individual students with research
opportunities both within the department and in the
research institutes listed above. Breadth in research and
teaching as well as experience in building links among
partner groups are likely to be valuable in this context.
Although the position emphasizes teaching, advising
and leading the M.A. program, we expect the DMAP
to be research active and include students in research.
It is important that the research plan shows an ability
to balance teaching, advising and a research program
that includes students.
Lectureships at Columbia University are faculty appoint-
ments with a primary focus on instruction; as noted
above, however, the Department of E3B expects its
lecturers to be research-active as well. Lectureships

EvolutionaryEcolSocialBehaviour
PhD position on The Evolutionary Ecology of Social
Behaviour, Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD),
NTNU, Trondheim, Norway
General aim of the project: Predicting responses to a
changing environment is currently one of the biggest
challenges in biology. The realization that evolutionary
change can rapidly aect ecological and demographic
processes, and thus determine the ability of populations
to cope with environmental change, has led to a rapid
increase in the number of studies focusing on the feed-
backs between ecology and evolution (eco-evolutionary
dynamics). Surprisingly, even though competition, co-
operation and sexual reproduction are key ecological
processes determining phenotypic evolution and the size
of populations, classic theory on the evolution of so-
cial behaviour has not been fully integrated within the
eco-evolutionary dynamics paradigm. There is thus
a huge gap in our understanding of eco-evolutionary
dynamics, which hinders our ability to predict how pop-
ulations will respond to the rapid environmental change
currently faced by many organisms. This project will
help build this missing bridge between social behaviour
and eco-evolutionary dynamics research using a uni-
ed framework based on behavioural ecology theory on
social traits, quantitative genetic models providing sta-
tistical descriptions of the responses to selection, and
population projection models focusing on stochastic pop-
ulation dynamics. We will focus on a house sparrow
meta-population on Norwegian islands that has been
monitored since the early 90s. The project will involve
analyses of existing data and eldwork.
Accordingly, the main aims of the PhD position are 1) to
quantify how social interactions aect the reproductive
success of individuals; 2) to quantify the spatial and
social structure of house sparrows in dierent island pop-
ulations; and 3) to quantify how the patterns of socialNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 85
interactions aect population dynamics and how popu-
lation dynamics aect the patterns of social interactions.
These aims will be achieved using an exceptional multi-
year dataset from a house sparrow meta-population in
Norway.
The position will suit a PhD candidate who is keen
to learn advanced statistical methods, and apply them
to understand patterns, causes and consequences of
phenotypic variation arising in wild populations. It
will provide complete doctoral education to obtain a
doctoral degree, including primary research training,
PhD-level credit courses, and appropriate teaching expe-
rience. Research training will include data management,
statistical analyses including mixed models and capture-
mark-recapture approaches, experience of eld data col-
lection, and experience of working within a collaborative
research team.
Requirements: The successful candidate should have a
quantitative methods background in evolutionary biol-
ogy and behavioural ecology. The working environment
is English.
Project group: The project is based on a recently funded
proposal \Social dynamics and eco-evolutionary feed-
backs in wild populations" by the Research Council of
Norway. The PhD student will work in the Centre for
Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD; https://www.ntnu.edu/-
cbd ) at the University of Science and Technology
(NTNU; https://www.ntnu.edu/ ) in Trondheim, Nor-
way. The main supervisors will be Yimen Araya-Ajoy
and Jonathan Wright and the PhD-student will collab-
orate closely with Myranda Murray, Jane Reid, Bernt-
Erik S ~Ather and Henrik Jensen. CBD is a leading
center on evolutionary ecology research and is located
on the beautiful Trondheim fjord. The city has a very

with great access to nature. For more information about
the project, please contact yimen.araya-ajoy@ntnu.no

UMichigan InsectCollectionManager
Posting Title: Research Museum Collection Manager -
Insect Division
Posting salary range: $48,000 - $56,000
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
(EEB) is seeking a Collection Manager for the Mu-
seum of Zoology (UMMZ) Insect Division ( https:/-
/lsa.umich.edu/ummz/insects.html), located at the new
state of the art Research Museums Center (RMC) in
Ann Arbor, Michigan. The UMMZ develops and main-
tains zoological collections explicitly for use in research
and education, beneting science, society, and the uni-
versity at large. The scientic role of the UMMZ is to
train students and engage in systematic biology and
biodiversity studies. These broad and overlapping elds
entail the discovery and study of the diversity of organ-
isms, their evolutionary relationships, and the processes
involved in the origin of biodiversity. EEB has a highly
diverse and collaborative group of researchers in evolu-
tionary biology and biodiversity science. We are looking
for an outstanding individual to become the Insect Col-
lection Manager and join the team of other curators and
collection managers at the UMMZ (and Herbarium), as
well as other researchers at the University of Michigan.
The UMMZ Insect Collection is worldwide in its ge-
ographic scope and one of the largest of its type, in-
cluding more than 4.5 million prepared specimens. The
collection is particularly strong in North, Central and
South American diversity, with a taxonomic focus on
Orthoptera that comprises the second largest holdings
in the western hemisphere (second only to the Academy
of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia), as well as the
Acari, which is one of the largest collections of mites
and ticks in the country. Historical collections dateback to the early 20th Century and include irreplace-
able samples from North and Central America. Other
large collections, including synoptic holdings of taxa
and/or geographic regions (e.g., the Odonata), are also
represented.
We seek candidates with a strong commitment to a
vision of the Insect Collection as a key resource for re-
search and education within the University and to the
entomological community nationally and internationally.
The position oers exciting opportunities for mentoring,
and career development, including research within the

itization (GMD) of the insect collections, including
specimens and tissue/DNA samples, eld notes, geo-
graphic and environmental data, and digital assets such
as photography. Activities will include organizing and
participating in eld expeditions (possibly including in-
ternational collecting), coordinating and contributing
directly to digitization eorts (including imaging of spec-
imens and participation on iNaturalist). These work
activities involve routine maintenance and updating of
the Specify database through which our holdings are
made accessible to researchers across the world. These
activities are performed in ongoing coordination with
faculty curators and require regular attention to our
electronic, searchable database. 2. Working with fac-
ulty curators and the Museums registrar to develop and
implement policies, standards, and procedures. This
involves standard operating procedures for acquisition,
accessioning, processing interdepartmental and inter-
institutional loans, databasing, archival and use of ge-
nomic, digital resources and other ancillary collections.
Reviewing, updating, and enhancing the insect collec-
tions management plan. 3. Daily management of sta
workers, work-study students, graduate curatorial assis-
tants, and other personnel, as well as support for student
and visiting researchers who are utilizing the research
collections and/or enhancing collection resources, in co-
ordination with faculty curators. This includes creating
an inclusive work environment for training and supervi-
sion in all aspects of specimen preparation and collection
maintenance tasks, database use, and geo- referencing
and digital imaging of specimens as well as collections-
based research practices when appropriate. 4. Partic-
ipate in grant writing to secure funding for research
projects that support and enhance collection resources
such as collection- based grants. 5. Coordination of and
participation in research visits and educational tours of
the collections and other museum outreach activities.

AcousticAdaptation
UnpublishedData
Dear all,
We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on the
acoustic adaptation hypothesis across animals. We aim
to test whether habitat structure predicts animal vocal-
isations (within and across species) and specically, if
species inhabiting dense vegetation are prone to vocalise
at lower frequencies, narrower frequency ranges, and
have longer inter-element intervals compared to species
living in open areas.
As meta-analyses are aected by publication bias, we are
looking for unpublished datasets that quantied acous-
tic variables across dierent types of habitat, within
and/or across species. Preferably, the dataset should
include sample size and mean estimate for each variable.
In case you have, or know of such unpublished data sets,
please let's get in touch - we would be really happy to
hear about it from you! Moreover, we would be very
grateful if you could point us to published works that
provide this type of information but may go unnoticed
in database searches applying search terms like 'acoustic
adaptation', 'song', 'acoustic', 'habitat' and 'vegetation'.
For any suggestions or questions please email: bar-

Dear colleagues, I hope this email nds you well!
As the new Tiputini Biodiversity Station Director, it
is an honor for me to invite you collaborate with us in
this new project.
Under my Direction, we will seek to transform the Tipu-
tini Biodiversity Station in a beacon for scientic knowl-
edge, an observatory for the conservation of the region,
and a more active academic site.
I really hope you will join us and choose to do your re-
search in this unique tropical site. It is unique because
it is located within the world's greatest biodiversity
hotspot, the hyperdiverse Yasun  Biosphere Reserve;
and also, because our forest is still unharmed by di-
rect human activities (if pristine forests exist, we are
there!). Additionally, we have amazing facilities such as
a canopy tower and a network of easy-access and well-
marked trails, that allow reaching our fantastic forest
and all the biodiversity within it.
In order to host you and make your scientic life easier,
we are launching new services for our researchers, such
as: year-round eld assistants, private labs, umbrella
research/genetic permits (we do all the paperwork re-
lated to permits for you!), samples exportation, updated
and historic climatic data, yearly/long-term research
memberships, and full logistic support. We also host
academic programs if you are interested in that matter
too.
Besides, we have new and very aordable fees, that are
all-inclusive and perfect to do long-term projects for
you or your lab members (graduate and undergradu-
ate students included). Please feel free to send me an
email (cc'ing our Research Coordinator Diego Mosquera
dmosquera@usfq.edu.ec and our Field Supervisor cul-
loae@usfq.edu.ec), if you have any question and want
to visit us soon.
Please share this email widely with your contacts, es-
pecially to those in associations, networks, journals,
institutes, academic departments, and such, and ask
them to distribute it accordingly as well. Sorry about
cross-posting, as I'm sending this email to hundreds of
colleagues.
We are very much looking forward reaching all the sci-
entists as possible and to hear from you soon!108 EvolDir November 1, 2021

PROGRESS MEETINGS IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOL-
OGY
We are excited to announce the next round of this ini-
tiative by the European Society of Evolutionary Biology
(ESEB), in partnership with the Journal of Evolutionary
Biology (/JEB/).
We invite applications for funding to support focussed
conference or workshops on a topical issue where rapid
progress is currently being made in understanding Evo-
lutionary Biology. ESEB will supply funds up to euro
15,000 to assist with workshop planning (venue, travel
or attendance support). We encourage proposals on any
topic.
We expect these meetings to bring together a range of
researchers focussed around a topic for a \state of the
art" conference, ideally proposing a new synthesis, view-
point or technical or analytical breakthrough facilitating
new avenues of research. Attendees would represent re-
searchers from all career stages and must accord with
our Equal Opportunities guidelines. Attendance should
be open to all, but ESEB members should be prioritised.
Typically, meetings would last 2-3 days.
An important condition of the funding is that the meet-
ing has a clear objective to produce either a Special Issue
or Target Review for /JEB/. Organisers should aim to
have the manuscript(s) produced within 4 months of
the end of the meeting, and should detail how this will
be done in their applications. In the case of a Special
Issue, the organisers of the meeting or appropriate nom-
inees may serve as Guest Editors (where appropriate),
handling the peer review process for manuscripts arising
from the meeting with assistance from /JEB/ editors.
There will be one call for applications per year, with this
year's deadline being DECEMBER 17, 2021. Applicants
should be members of ESEB or our sister society, the
Society for the Study of Evolution.There is no ocial application form. The application
document should include
- The title of the conference and why this is suitable for a
Progress Meeting. - Names and addresses of the organis-
ers, with short (1 page each) CVs - List of keynote speak-
ers, with justication (potentially key recent references).
They should have agreed in principle to participate - A
2-page description of the aims and potential scope of
the conference - Conference venue details - Methods of
selecting participants - Publication plans
Queries and applications should be submitted to the
ESEB Oce (oce@eseb.org) by the deadline. The
successful application will be chosen by an ESEB com-
mittee.

ISCB EvolCompGen and SMBE are hosting a webinar
on phylogenetic network inference next week!
Date: Tuesday, Nov 2nd from 11am-12pm ET
Speaker: Dr. Claudia Solis-Lemus, University of
Wisconsin-Madison
Talk Title: Scalable Inference of Phylogenetic Networks
Talk Abstract: Phylogenetic network inference plays
an important role in the reconstruction of the tree of
life, given the widespread gene ow among dierent
organisms. However, there are many challenges in the
inference of reticulate evolution such as network recon-
struction and interpretation, and diculties to summa-
rize network uncertainty. In this talk, I will explain the
current diculties in network statistical inference and
present a new scalable method based on pseudolikeli-
hood theory. I will also present extensions of standard
trait evolution tools to networks, such as phylogenetic
regression or ANOVA, ancestral trait reconstruction,
and Pagel's lambda test of phylogenetic signal. All the
new tools are implemented in the open-source Julia110 EvolDir November 1, 2021
package PhyloNetworks.

Dear Colleagues,
The University of Kansas Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology, along with Departments of Molec-
ular Biosciences, Geology and Physics & Astronomy,
will be running an online workshop on Oct 23 for stu-
dents that might be interested in applying to graduate
school in one of these STEM elds. The workshop is
targeted towards those who identify as being from a
group historically underrepresented in the sciences. It
is also not targeted specically at students interested in
applying to KU, but more broadly.
Workshop participants will learn about graduate school,
career opportunities and will receive help on writing
personal statements and CVs.
A short application is due by Friday October 15. Details
and schedule can be found here:
https://dnsku.weebly.com/ Please feel free to let any-
one know that you think might be interested! Attendees
last year found it very helpful!Best,

PCI Genomics
SeekingManagingEditors
PCI Genomics is seeking to recruit several members to
join the board of Managing Editors.
About PCI Genomics. PCI Genomics is a community
of the parent project Peer Community In. In brief, we
are a community of recommenders, playing the role of
associate editors, who recommend unpublished articles
based on peer reviews to make them complete, reliable
and citable articles, without the need for publication in
'traditional' journals in a plea to give back the control of
the recommendation process to the scientic community.
Evaluation and recommendation by PCI Genomics are
free of charge. The scope of PCI Genomics encompasses
all aspects of genomics (structural genomics, functional
genomics, epigenomics, evolutionary genomics, popu-
lation genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics) dealing
with every type of organism (viruses, bacteria, fungi,
plants, animals,...) as well as metagenomes. Currently,
the Managing Board of PCI Genomics is formed by
four members (Pierre Capy, University Paris-Saclay,
France; Rosa Fern andez, Institute of Evolutionary Bi-
ology (CSpanish Research Council-University Pompeu
Fabra), Spain; Jean-Fran cois Flot, Evolutionary Biology
& Ecology, Universit e Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium; and
Denis Tagu, INRAE, France).
The role. We are seeking to recruit several Managing
Editors in order to respond to the increasing submission
rate and expand our expertise to better assess a broader
diversity of scientic topics in the eld of genomics. We
are particularly interested in the recruitment of scien-
tists with expertise in human and paleogenomics and
genomics of non-animal organisms (eg, plants, fungi, mi-
croeukaryotes, etc). We are committed to increase the112 EvolDir November 1, 2021
diversity of the board, and we particularly encourage
applications from non-European and underrepresented
communities.
As a member of the Managing Role, your duties will
consist of:
-
Discussing updates on every submission in weekly or bi-
weekly meetings, including relevance and progress in the
peer review process, as well as taking nal decisions to-
gether with the recommenders about recommendations.
-
Promoting PCI Genomics at scientic conferences and
gatherings. -
Helping recruiting recommenders. -
Participating in the decision making related to the func-
tioning and governance of PCI in general and PCI Ge-
nomics in particular.
How to apply. If you are interested in joining
us in the board of Managing Editors, please send
a one-page CV and a motivation letter to con-
tact@genomics.peercommunityin.org. Deadline for ap-
plications is 30th of November 2021. Please feel free to
contact us directly to discuss any questions you may
have.

Dear colleagues,
we are looking for examples of terrestrial animal or plant
species from the northern temperate region, which prob-
ably expanded their ranges southwards into areas that
hold the glacial refugia for related taxa (and/or taxa
with similar ecological requirements). The evidence for
such expansion may be in (sub)fossil record or phylo-

AND REGIONAL MEETINGS.
SMBE will promote interdisciplinary research and ex-
tend its actions worldwide by sponsoring (1) joint meet-
ings with meetings of other societies; symposia or ple-
nary lectures on molecular biology and evolution at
meetings whose primary focus is not molecular evolu-
tion; (2) regional meetings outside the US, Europe, and
Japan; (3) small regional meetings in the US, Europe,
or Japan targeted towards PhD students and postdocs
with the purpose of helping them develop their presen-
tation skills and facilitate networking. This year, given
the various international COVID travel restrictions, we
are particularly interested in receiving applications for
regional meetings on any topic that falls within the
research scope represented by our society.
Most recent SMBE Regional and Interdisciplinary meet-
ings were:
- \Israeli Society of Evolutionary Biology inaugural meet-
ing", Israel, December 2019.
- \Evolutionary genomics at the human-environment in-
terface", Malawi, September 2019 (regional) <https:/-

Mandrillus
Role description
The Projet Mandrillus aims at longitudinally study-
ing wild mandrills in Southern Gabon. We are cur-
rently recruiting a Volunteer Field Assistant for our
2022 eld season. These positions combine practical
research with training and are entirely eld-based. The
volunteers are trained by and work alongside local eld
assistants, eld managers, students and researchers, con-
tributing to the research activities of the Projet Man-
drillus. Following established protocols, the eldwork
will primarily involve daily follows of a natural pop-
ulation of mandrills on foot, collecting data on the
behavior of individually recognizable animals, together
with the collection of non-invasive measurements and
samples. Please visit the website of the project to get
an idea of the scientic programs that are currently run-
ning (http://www.projetmandrillus.com/research-and-
conservation.html).
Positions available
One Volunteer Field Assistant position is currently avail-
able running for 12 months, starting on February 2022.
What we cover
Once the volunteers arrive in the eld site, the Projet
Mandrillus covers all their work-related costs, including
accommodation (private equipped room with air-con
and private bathroom, shared kitchen) and a stipend
for meals (about 200 euro /month).
Volunteers need to take at their own charge, a repatria-
tion and health insurance for their entire stay (we will
ask for a proof).
Who are we looking for?
This position is open to all with an interest in animal
behavior and ecology. We are particularly keen to hear
from applicants who:
- Are friendly, easy-going people, happy to live in small
team at a remote eld site
- Are strongly motivated, reliable, honest and committed
- Have good levels of physical tness and stamina - you
will be following the mandrills on foot 12 hours a day,
4-5 days per week, over mountainous terrain, in heatNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 115
- Show good initiative, with a willingness to learn and
show attention to detail
- A good level in French is a plus
What do volunteers get out of it?
- An amazing opportunity to share the lives of wild
mandrills in an equatorial forest landscape
- An opportunity to learn new skills and gain experience,
especially those relevant to research in behaviour and
ecology
- An opportunity to be involved in a long-term project
on African wildlife, hosted by an international research
institution
- An opportunity to use this eld experience with the as
a stepping stone on to future Masters and PhD degree
courses
- Experience a new culture and share knowledge with
local assistants
How to apply
If you would like to apply, please prepare a CV and a de-
tailed covering letter that should explain why you would
like to work on the project. The CV should include the
names of two referees with e-mail contact details.
Applications must be sent at projetman-
drillus@gmail.com as soon as possible. The deadline for
applications is the 14th of November. We will notify
successfully shortlisted candidates few days after this
deadline, and interviews will be held by skype the
following week.
The Study Site
Weather
Gabon has an Equatorial climate with little seasonality.
Precipitations are important, almost every day from
October to May, and days may be hot (up to 30 ^AoC),
although the Parc de la L ek edi benets from a cooler
weather because of its altitude (600m). The long dry
season, from June to September, is characterized by cool
weather (temperatures can fall below 18 ^AoC) with no
precipitation.
Landscape
The Parc de la L ek edi (http://www.parcdelalekedi.com/-
) is characterized by a mix of savannas and gallery
forests interspersed with rivers and riverbeds. Equato-
rial Marantaceae forests are found in the area.
Wildlife
The Parc de la L ek edi is home to a variety of wildlife
including forest bualos, several apes (chimpazees, go-
rillas) and other primates (cephus, nictitans) and, ofcourse, mandrills! Predators include, occasionally, leop-
ards (but don't expect any encounter with them!). Birds
and reptiles also abound. As well as plenty of butteries!
Location
The Parc de la L ek edi is located in Southern Gabon. It
is only a 1 hour drive from Moanda, the nearest town
that comprises hotels, petrol stations, banks, basic shops
and markets.
https://g.page/parc-de-la-lekedi?share Working Condi-
tions
Data collection requires full-day follows of the study
group. This ensures that the location of the sleeping
sites used by the mandrills each night is known, which
in turn facilitates their pick-up by observers early the
next morning. If the day begins late, or ends early,
the mandrills can be lost and may take several days to
relocate. Each day, seven days a week, a team of at
least two persons goes in the eld from

UHolar Iceland
FishCognitionIntership
Hello everyone,
The Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology, H olar
University, Iceland, is looking for a Masters student for a
project about Arctic charr spatial cognition. See advert
below:
Title : Internship position in sh behavior and cognition
Hosting structure : Department of Aquaculture & sh
Biology, H olar University - Iceland
Dates : from January 2022 to June 2022, but discussable
Context of the study: Comparative studies might give
an insight on how cognition has evolved across taxa.
The evolution of spatial cognition is of particular inter-
est because all animals depend on navigational skills
to nd food or mates, retrieve the nest and escape
predators. Hence, spatial cognitive abilities have an
impact on individuals' tness and are consequently sub-
ject to natural selection. In that sense, spatial cognitive116 EvolDir November 1, 2021
abilities in each population should be locally adapted
to its particular ecological conditions. The Icelandic
Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus, AC) is found as sev-
eral sympatric morphs thriving in very dierent types
of habitats, from anadromous to benthic and pelagic
lake-resident morphs, and ranging along an evolution-
ary gradient of divergence. We hypothesize cognitive
abilities to be shaped according to both evolutionary
history and current ecological factors. The project is led
by Prof. David Benha m (lead PI, H olar Univ., Iceland)
in collaboration across H olar Univ. (Prof. Bjarni K.
Kristj ansson, Dr. Camille Leblanc), University of Caen,
France (Dr. Christelle Jozet), IFREMER, France (Dr.
Marie-Laure B egout, Dr. Benjamin Geroy), INRA,
France (Dr. Xavier Cousin) and University of Iceland
(Prof. Zophon as O. J onsson).
Student project: The student will specically be in-
volved in identifying cognitive ability dierences between
morphs and environments, by monitoring learning abil-
ities in ospring of wild-caught AC morphs along a
degree of divergence and raised under complex vs. plain
conditions. To do so, the student will be working in
close collaboration with a PhD student to train AC in-
dividuals to solve spatial cognitive tasks in a maze, and
then highlight behavioral dierences using an automated
behavioral tracking software s/he will be introduced to.
Requirements: The candidates must be enrolled in a de-
gree in the elds of ethology, evolutionary or behavioral
ecology, or relevant equivalent elds. The ideal candi-
date has a strong interest in pluridisciplinary research
with an emphasis on cognition. S/he enjoys working in
a dynamic group but should be able to work indepen-
dently as well. Statistical skills will be a plus. A valid
driving license is a requirement.
Organizational details: Working language is English.
The student will be provided with a discount on Univer-
sity accommodation as a lab member, and commuting
between the lab and the accommodation place will be
at the lab's charge. The student will also have free ac-
cess to the University gym, pool, hot pot and cold pot.
Aside, remuneration is not available for this project, but
Iceland is eligible for Erasmus+ grants.
Application: Applicants should send an application let-
ter, with a statement of research interests and relevant
experience and curriculum vitae as a single pdf to both
Pr. David Benha m, benhaim@holar.is and Dr. Mar-
ion Dellinger, marion@holar.is. For further information

UIowa REU Evolution
Please share with your undergraduate students!!
The University of Iowa is oering ten NSF-funded Re-
search Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) oppor-
tunities during the summer of 2022. Research projects
span a range of topics, including evolution of behavior,
origin of species, cancer evolution, evolution of sex, evo-
devo, evolution of pathogens, and paleontology. REU
students work on one project, but through interactions
with their cohort ultimately receive a broad exposure
to evolutionary science. Students in the program: re-
ceive training in research best practices, participate in
career workshops, create a digital exhibit based on their
research for the University of Iowa Natural History Mu-
seum, and make formal research presentations based on
their work. Free housing, a meal allowance, a $6000
stipend, and a travel allowance will be provided to all
participants. Students from groups historically excluded
from science because of their ethnicity or race and/or
who have limited research opportunities at their home
institution are especially encouraged to apply.

ological Sciences at the University of South Carolina
invite expressions of interest from evolutionary biology
faculty at other institutions who are interested in being
nominated to be a McCausland Visiting Scholar in the
UofSC College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) during the
2022-2023 academic year.
McCausland Visiting Scholars are expected to catalyze
the teaching, research, and creative activities of CAS fac-
ulty and students by engaging fully in research projects
and curriculum-oriented materials and by sharing their
expertise in courses, seminars, and other academic pro-
grams. Scholars augment current course oerings by
teaching and conducting undergraduate seminars, men-
toring students, and involving students in research.
Appointments are for a minimum of one week, but are
normally longer, e.g. a semester during a sabbatical
from the scholar's home institution. Visiting scholars
receive compensation of up to $20,000 (based on quali-
cations and term of appointment), and up to $7500 in
reimbursements for housing, travel, or supplies. Visiting
scholars are provided with an oce for the duration of
the appointment, and have a faculty sponsor to serve as
an academic liaison during the scholar's stay. The CAS
intends to notify departments of whether their nominees
were selected in early February, 2022. Visiting scholars
hold temporary appointments in the College of Arts& Sciences, and are subject to University policies and
procedures. An invitation or appointment as a visit-
ing scholar does not constitute an oer of permanent
employment.
To be eligible for nomination, an individual must hold
a Ph.D. or comparable terminal degree and should be
an established scholar with a distinguished record of
accomplishment in research and teaching. There are no
citizenship or residency restrictions.

StatisticalGenetics
Center for Quantitative Genetics, QGG at Aarhus Uni-
versity is recruiting two 2-year postdocs in statistical
genetics. The candidates will be developing statistical
modeling approaches used in genomic informed drug
target identication.
The overall goal of the project is to obtain a better
understanding of the biological basis of common multi-
factorial diseases such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus usinginformation from a range of human genetics and func-
tional genomics datasets. A better understanding of the
underlying disease biology will enable a more precise
and accurate identication of potential drug targets and
a more precise identication of patients in the selection
and development of clinical trials. The primary tasks
will be 1) development of novel multiple trait statis-
tical approaches for ne-mapping of genetic variants
and estimation of genomic parameters (e.g. heritability
and genetic correlation), 2) use these novel statistical
approaches to integrate association genetics signals for
a range of traits with functional annotations to iden-
tify and characterize potential drug targets for further
therapeutic development. The project is a joint collab-
oration between Center for Quantitative Genetics andNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 119
Genomics (QGG) and Steno Diabetes Centre Aarhus
(SDCA), Aarhus University, Denmark. The project is
funded through an externally nanced research grant
and employment follows the project grant.

Postdoc:AMUPoznan EvolutionaryImmunogenetics
Post-Doc in an NCN-funded project aiming to in-
vestigate coevolution at the level of genes between
Lime disease agent, Borrelia afzelli, and its rodent
host, is oered by Radwan lab at AMU (https://-
evobio.home.amu.edu.pl/). The candidate should hold
PhD degree in biological sciences or bioinformatics and
should have signicant publication record in the area of
evolutionary biology, molecular genetics or bioinformat-
ics. The employment is oered for three years, starting
ideally in January 2021, but it is negotiable.
Interested candidates should send their cv via email to
the project leader Jacek Radwan (jradwan@amu.edu.pl),
who will provide further information about the project
and application procedure. Please apply before 30
November 2020.
Brief summary of the project: Hosts are under evolu-
tionary pressure to be able to ght infections, whereas
infectious organisms are under selection to evade host
immune system. This paradigm predicts co-evolution
of host immune systems and their targets in pathogens,
with both parties in a need for continuous adaptation
in order to keep up with the opponent - a dynamics
described as a Red Queen process. Such co-evolution
may have important consequences for several crucial
evolutionary processes the maintenance of sex, sexual
selection, speciation and evolution of virulence. Yet,
demonstrating that co-evolution is actually occurring
requires knowledge of interacting genes in both hosts
and parasites. This condition is fullled for Lime-disease
agent, the spirochete Borrelia and its mammalian hosts.
The project will test predictions of Red Queen hypothe-
sis, and will investigate its consequences for speciation
and epidemiology.

*Description*
We aim to recruit highly motivated and creative re-
searchers with strong training in statistical or popula-
tion genetics. Our group seeks to understand the genetic
basis of rapid adaptation in dierent climates and the
spatial dynamics of species extinction.
Projects include developing population genetics theo-
ries and conducting analyses with whole-genome se-
quence data from evolution experiments with Arabidop-
sis thaliana. These experiments are being conducted
in~50 locations around the world and populations are
re-sequenced for 4+ consecutive years (GrENE-net.org)
(following work from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-
019-1520-9). With these data, some questions we aim
to address are: How strong, polygenic, and repeatable
is natural selection in realistic environments? Can we
predict it? How does selection vary across dense climate
gradients? Did evolutionary rescue occur and what were
the genetic signals preceding it?
Other projects include analyzing genomes of non-model
species with geographic data, including threatened
species, to understand how genetic diversity is dis-
tributed in space (following https://doi.org/10.1101/-
2021.10.13.464000). Some questions addressed: how are
neutral and adaptive genetic diversity spatially struc-
tured? How do dierent spatial patterns of extinction
lead to dierential erosion of species diversity and adap-
tive capacity? Can we track \genetic health" of ecosys-
tems as they transform using geo-tagged genomes and
real-time satellite information? The position requires
leading independent research using large genomic and
experimental datasets, participating in collaborativeNovember 1, 2021 EvolDir 121
projects, preparing publications, and presenting research
in scientic meetings.

PlantPopGenomics
Two-year postdoc research project on the population
genomics of sexual selection in plants!
The Plant Repro Evo lab (https://lab-
allience.natur.cuni.cz/plantreproevo) is searching
for a motivated postdoc researcher to work on the
population genomics of sexual selection in plants. The
project will study the impact of sexual selection on the
evolution of plant genomes in natural populations. In
addition, part of the project will elucidate the genetic
basis of male performance in plants.
The project will use already well-established methods
(QTL approach), but also will require potentially to
develop new population genomics approaches. We ex-
pect the successful candidate to work autonomously and
actively lead the project, and thus he/she should have
experience with population genomics, genomics in gen-
eral, and bioinformatics. The postdoc project is directly
connected to the work of PhD students working on the
molecular basis of sexual selection and the role of sexual
selection in plant speciation, and therefore we expect the
successful candidate to be able to work in collaboration
with a team. Part of the project will involve visiting the
lab of collaborators, in particular Adrien Sicard's lab
in Uppsala, Sweden (https://sicardlab.wordpress.com/).
Therefore, we expect the applicant to be mobile.
The Plant Repro Evo lab is hosted by the De-
partment of Botany of Charles University (https://-
www.natur.cuni.cz/biology/botany) and is located in
the beautiful Botanical Garden of the university, right
in the historical centre of the culturally vibrant Prague
city (Czech Republic).
The contract is for two years, to start at the begin-
ning of January 2022. For more information, contact

About the group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population ge-
netics forces like mutation, selection and stochastic-
ity. Our group is particularly interested in how the
evolution and survival of cancer cell populations re-
lies on mutation inux as well as in selection infer-ence from observed mutation data. To this end, we
develop mathematical and computational approaches
to estimate mutation rates and selection. Estimates
of the strength of selection in cancer allow for a pri-
oritization of genes and non-coding regions by their
disease relevance, with the ultimate goal of promot-
ing therapeutic advances. Coding sequences of cancer
tumors not only exhibit positively selected mutations
that drive cancer (www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-
0572-y), but there also exists a small fraction of genes
that the tumor cannot aord to lose (www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3987). In addition to genes, cancer driver
loci can occur in the non-coding part of the genome
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00100-x).
We are also interested in mutation rates and selection in-
ference in the context of human genetic variation, includ-
ing polymorphisms (http://www.nature.com/articles/-
ng.3831 ; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/-
8/1701/5475505?login=true) and de novo variants
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17162-z). Here,
a particular focus of the group lies on the description
of purifying selection in humans and across species, ac-
counting for mutational processes as well as the eects
of genetic drift.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling lab was estab-
lished in October 2018 and is part of the \Bioinfor-
matics and Genomics" program at the CRG. Further

Postdoc in Community Ecology & Evolution
A two-year postdoctoral position (with possible exten-
sion) in eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite com-
munities is available on ERC-CZ grant in Jan Hrcek's
lab [ http://lab.hrcek.net ] at the Biology Centre, Czech
Academy of Sciences, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.
How is species diversity maintained in communities is
one of the main questions in community ecology and
it has been studied without considering evolutionary
changes. Yet, we now know that rapid adaptation often
happens at the same timescale as ecological changes,
resulting in entangled eco-evolutionary dynamics. We
therefore need to nd out what is the role of evolution-
ary changes in maintenance of diversity in communities
and community stability.
The candidate will join the team working on a fron-
tier ERC-CZ grant. This collaborative project uti-
lizes a novel experimental community model system
of wild Drosophila species and their parasitoids from
tropical Australia. We are able to perform multigenera-
tional laboratory microcosm experiments and track eco-
evolutionary dynamics in ne detail. The candidate will
conduct laboratory experiments on eco-evolutionary dy-
namics of communities, corresponding eco-evolutionary
modelling, or both. Experience with ecological, evolu-
tionary, or eco-evolutionary modelling is therefore an
advantage. There is also possibility of eldwork in Aus-
tralia (likely to be possible in 2022 or 2023). Further,
there will be opportunities to develop the project in a
direction of the candidate's own choosing.
The laboratory is an international team of PhD stu-
dents, postdocs and technicians and the applicant will
have the opportunity to work extensively with other
team members. The laboratory can provide substantialresources and support for exceptional research. Fur-
ther, the candidate will collaborate within the PI's wide
international network and establish new links for this
project.
The review of applications will begin on 1st December
2021 and will continue until the position is lled. The
salary of 60.000CZK/month gross + benets more than
comfortably covers living expenses in Ceske Budejovice
and international holiday travel. Salary would increase
if the applicant develops the project into a fellowship.
Expected starting date is rst half of 2022. The working
language is English and applicants from all countries
are eligible.
To apply please send one document with your CV, con-
tact details for three references, and cover letter stating
qualications, previous work and motivation to Jan

DTU
ComputationalPopulationGenetics
DTU Health Tech seeks qualied candidates for a post-
doc position in computational population genetics with
a potential start date around December 1, 2021 (or
according to mutual agreement).
Responsibilities In this position, you will develop algo-
rithms and computational methods to deal with the
analysis of large datasets from modern and ancient
sources. More specically, these algorithms will be
aimed at analyzing a large number of ancient genomes
using population genetics methods. Additional infor-
mation should be obtained by contacting the potential
main supervisor directly. The university is located in
the greater Copenhagen area, which is acknowledged for
its excellent standards of living, childcare and welfare
system.
Current computational methods are often ill-equipped
to deal with DNA extracted from ancient populations.
This ancient DNA shows high levels of fragmentation
and accumulated chemical damage. Furthermore, the
number of individuals that can be sequenced is often
limited. Fortunately, several problems pertaining to an-
cient DNA and ancient paleogenetics can be described in
a maximum-likelihood framework and computer science
techniques can help us to solve such numerical problems
eciently via machine learning, numerical algorithms124 EvolDir November 1, 2021
and data structures. You will work in collaboration with
other partners including the University of Copenhagen
in order to develop the next generation of algorithms
and software applied to DNA from fossils which can
then be used to reconstruct population history and infer
selection.
Given the COVID19 pandemic, we will happily accom-
modate requests for remote work until in-person work
is deemed safe.
Qualications You must hold a PhD degree (or equiva-
lent) ideally in biological science with a focus on quanti-
tative and mathematical aspects, or in computer science
or mathematics.
The candidate we are looking for should ideally have
the following qualications:
* Knowledge of a programming language like Python,
Perl, C++ and/or Java * Ability to work in a UNIX
environment, ideally in a high-performance computing
environment * Thorough understanding of basic princi-
ples of population genetics * Knowledge of probabilities
and statistics * Firm grasp of rst-year university mathe-
matics (dierential calculus/linear algebra) * Knowledge
of coalescence theory or diusion theory is an advan-
tage * Expertise in next-generation sequencing data
generation and processing is also a plus

IndianaU EvoDevoPlasticity
Postdoctoral Fellow: evaluating the proximate causes
and evolutionary consequences of developmental plas-
ticity
We are seeking a highly motivated and creative indi-
vidual to join the Led??n-Rettig lab as a Postdoctoral
Fellow at Indiana University. We use interdisciplinary
approaches to understand both the proximate mecha-
nisms mediating developmental plasticity and its eco-
logical and evolutionary outcomes. To answer these
questions, we use spadefoot toads, whose larvae exhibit
extraordinary developmental plasticity in response to
dietary and social cues; further, this plasticity is associ-
ated with the evolution of novel and complex traits, such
as predaceous and often cannibalistic behaviors. A suc-
cessful candidate will combine transcriptomic, genomic,
endocrine, behavioral and morphological analyses to un-
derstand (1) how these traits arose evolutionarily, and
(2) how early life responses to the environment carry-
over into adulthood and future generations, through
transgenerational mechanisms.
We use this non-model amphibian because of its unique
environmental responsiveness, yet, the system oers an
abundance of tools for molecular investigation, including
several species with published genomes and transcrip-
tomes. We currently house a colony at Indiana Univer-
sity to facilitate controlled, experimental investigation
of developmental plasticity, and collect our animals from
the eld, both locally and in the Southwestern United
States. For more information on our group, please visit
our lab website (ledonrettig.com)

We invite applications for a 2-year and half (30 months)
postdoctoral position at INRAE \Ecology and Ecosys-
tem Health" lab located at Rennes (France), to work on
the TROPHIC STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING
OF KELP-FOREST FOOD WEBS
Context. Kelp forests are extensive underwater habitats
that range along 25% of the world's coastlines, providing
valuable resources, habitat, and services for coastal com-
munities. These ecosystems are facing major threats
due to marine pollution, overshing, overgrazing (by
urchins) and climate change that aect their trophic
structure and functioning. To understand the mecha-
nisms (such as functional compensation) that favor the
resilience and stability of kelp forests, we need to im-
prove our knowledge on their food web structure under
variable environmental conditions.
This project co-funded by the French Oce of Biodi-
versity (OFB) and the Brittany region aims to study
(1) the trophic interactions among organisms associated
with kelp forest (seals, birds, sh, invertebrates and
algae) in two marine protected areas and (2) the rela-
tionship between kelp forest functional structure (diet
of bioindicator species) and productivity (sh size and
abundance) along a gradient of turbidity and human
pressures (sediment discharge).
The successful candidate will be involved in sampling
activities (in coordination with scientic partners and
stakeholders) and will lead eDNA analyses developing a
multi-marker DNA metabarcoding approach. She/He
will be also responsible for the compilation of reference
database of DNA barcodes, bioinformatics analysis and
manuscript write-up.
REQUIREMENTS. Candidates should have a PhD de-
gree in ecology or equivalent and have spent at least
18 months outside of France between May 1st, 2017
and the starting of the project (a prerequisite from the
Brittany region). She/He must have a background in
eDNA analysis. Experience in designing and applying
metabarcoding analysis as well as additional skills in
community ecology in particular on marine ecosystems
will be appreciated. Autonomy and interpersonal skills
(ability to work in groups) are mandatory. The candi-date will be selected based on previous scientic track
record and qualications of relevance to the described
projects
The position is an excellent opportunity for candidates
who plan to defend their PhD before January 2022. All
nationalities and genders are encouraged to apply. The
position may start between January and May 2022. The
xed term contract provides a net salary of 2,200 euros
per month.
LOCATION & HOST LAB. The successful applicant
will work directly with Erwan Qu em er e in a stimulating
research group based in the Research unit ESE Ecol-
ogy and Ecosystem Health (Rennes, France) ( https:/-
/www6.rennes.inrae.fr/ese eng/). The group oers a

communities). The lab and local collaborators bene-
t from all equipment to develop the metabarcoding
approach: a room dedicated to \environmental DNA"
analysis (PCR-free laboratory), an Illumina sequenc-
ing platform and a bioinformatic server. The project

Post-doctoral position open at LBBE (Lyon, France)
on the \Individual and ecological determinants of or-
thonairovirus infection in wild ungulates"
Duration: 18 months; starting January 2022
The Laboratoire de Biom etrie et Biologie Evolutive
LBBE (https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/fr) is welcoming appli-
cations from enthusiastic and independent Post-doctoral
candidates to participate to a starting research projects
on the ecology of orthonairoviruses, RESPOND.
Context: The genus Orthonairovirus is a rapidly emerg-
ing group of tick-borne bunyaviruses that includes im-
portant pathogens of humans and livestock, as well as a
collection of other viruses about which little is known
notably regarding their pathogenic potential to humans
and animals, not even the hosts in which they naturally
circulate. Among them, Crimean-Congo Hemorragic
Fever Virus (CCHFV) is nowadays the most important
Orthonairovirus in terms of human disease, causing se-
vere forms of hemorrhagic fever, with increased numbers
of sporadic cases and outbreaks over the years. Other
orthonairoviruses have also been associated with milder
disease forms. The presence of CCHFV outside the
endemic areas was recently evidenced in ticks recovered
from Iberian ibex, deer and wild boar in Spain. Recently,
serological evidence of CCHFV was reported, in cattle
from Corsica (Grech-Angelini et al., 2020) and in wild
ungulates in Spain (Espunyes et al. 2021).
Objectives: While studies report the presence of CCHF
and other orthonairoviruses in various areas and species,
knowledge on the determinants of exposure to or-
thonairoviruses of tick's hosts and the consequences
of these viruses on their tness remain poor. The inten-
sive monitoring of the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
and the wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the French popula-
tions of Chiz e (roe deer and wild boar), Trois-Fontaines
and Aurignac (roe deer) might help to gain such knowl-
edge. These research programs result in longitudinal
follow-up of known-aged individuals over lifetime and
an assessment of population dynamics and evolutionary
processes.
Samples of serum are available from the roe deer cap-
tured since 2010 and samples will be collected on wild
boar. The candidate will participate to the analyses of
these serum samples to detect antibodies to CCHFV130 EvolDir November 1, 2021
and other orthonairoviruses. Ticks will be collected
during the study period both on captured roe deer /
wild boar and in the eld. Ticks will be screened for
orthonairovirus sequences. Prevalence and distribution
of the identied orthonairoviruses will be determined
according to the host species' characteristics (e.g. sex,
age, immune status), and species of tick harbored. Data
from roe deer and ticks will be pooled to identify i) the
individual (e.g. sex, age) and ecological determinants of
orthonairovirus infection by of roe deer and wild boar;
and ii) the consequences of orthonairovirus infection on
their health (e.g. through an assessment of immune per-
formance or parasitic load), reproductive performance
and survival.
Environment: The LBBE is part of CNRS (Unit 5558)
and University of Lyon (University Claude Bernard
Lyon 1). Research topics encompass various aspects
of Biometry (or Biostatistics) and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy. The laboratory comprises 96 permanent positions
and about as many post-graduate students and post-
docs. Research themes in the lab are clustered around a
methodology (emphasizing the importance of modeling
and informatics in life and medical sciences), and an
evolutionary perspective, regardless of the investigation
level (from molecules to communities). This double
angle results in a synergy between methodological de-
velopments and biological questions.
Candidates: The applicants are expected to have a
strong background in serological diagnostic molecular
biology. Prior experience in epidemiology and analy-
sis of complex ecological data, and international train-
ing will constitute an advantage. Proven ability to
identify research objectives and meet agreed deadlines,
self-motivation, exibility, and assistance to others on-
going research works are essential. The ideal candidates
should be highly motivated, curious and enthusiastic
to work in a collaborative team. Excellent written and
communication skills in English are required.
Application: Candidates are invited
to contact Emmanuelle Gilot-Fromont
(emmanuelle.gilotfromont@vetagro-sup.fr) and Gilles
Bourgoin (gilles.bourgoin@vetagro-sup.fr) for further
details. Please send an application with the following: -

Project title: Understanding the origin of evolutionary
innovations using water strider propelling fan as a model
Keywords: EvoDevo, developmental genetics, RNAi,
Single cell-sequencing
Background: Evolutionary innovations are qualitatively
new and benecial phenotypes that allow the bearing
lineages to access previously unexploited ecological op-
portunities. Studying these traits oers a unique op-
portunity to understand how novelty arises and evolves.
Although many iconic examples have been documented,
it is still dicult to study the origin of evolutionary
innovations for various reasons. For example, systems
bearing striking evolutionary innovations may be in-
tractable for experimentation, or the innovation itself
may be too complex for manipulation.
Model system: The Khila lab has established the pro-
pelling fan of the water strider Rhagovelia (Figure1A)as a model to study the origin of evolutionary innova-
tions. The propelling fan in Rhagovelia is composed
of~20 plume-like structures that can be deployed or
retracted as the animal rows on the water (Santos et al.,
2017) (Figure 1B). The fan allows the water strider to
sustain permanent movement on fast owing streams ^A'
- a previously unexploited ecological opportunity that
is not accessible to fan-less species. This innovation
may have contributed to the burst of speciation of the
genus Rhagovelia, which alone accounts for almost half
of the species count in the family (over 400 species).
We investigate the origin of this evolutionary innovation
through a comparative study of the cellular and develop-
mental genetic mechanisms underlying fan development
in species with one pair, two pairs or no fans (Figure 1).
Project: The postdoctoral fellow will lead the eort
to generate single cell sequencing data from the legs
Rhagovelia and sister species legs, see (Santos et al.,
2017). This tissue includes multiple cell types, identi-
able based on molecular markers, including a cluster
of fan cells (Santos et al. 2017). She or he will analyse
the single cell data in collaboration with Francesconi
team and build a putative gene regulatory network to be
experimentally validated through experiments of gene
expression and RNAi knockdown.
Requirement: PhD degree.
Required skills: Excellent communication skills in En-
glish (written and spoken), motivation, creativity, cu-
riosity, critical thinking, good work ethics, teamwork,
and good inter-personal relationship with colleagues.
Acquired skills in large-scale data analysis and com-
putational biology. A track record of peer-reviewed
publications.
Desired skills: Knowledge in evolutionary developmen-
tal biology, previous experience in single cell RNA-seq
experimental and data analysis steps would be a plus.
How to apply: By email to abderrahman.khila@ens-
lyon.fr or mirko.francesconi@ens-lyon.fr with a motiva-
tion letter explaining why you are interested by this
position and how you think you are a good t, your CV

BIOSHIFTS is an international consortium composed
of 14 researchers from 7 countries and 12 research
agencies/institutes with a diverse and complementary
range of expertise in the eld of climate change research
and biodiversity redistribution. The overreaching aim of
BIOSHIFTS is to extend the conceptual and analytical
tools in range shift research, thereby improving our
ability to forecast biodiversity changes and inform
decision-making process in a rapidly changing world.BIOSHIFTS will leverage the power of a comprehensive
geo^ acompiling +30,000 species range shifts documented
in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems over
recent decades (Lenoir et al. Nature Ecology and
Evolution 4: 1044-1059), coupled with open-source
trait and environmental databases as well as innovative
macroevolutionary approaches to investigate range shift
processes across ecosystems, taxonomic and environ-
mental contexts (both natural and anthropogenic). The
specic objectives of BIOSHIFTS are to: (i) provide a
comprehensive overview of the patterns and magnitude
of biodiversity redistribution on Earth; (ii) explore
the links between macroevolutionary processes (e.g.
past rates of niche evolution) and contemporary range
shifts; and (iii) address the fundamental question
of how climate-induced range shifts arise from the
interplay of intrinsic (e.g. physiological tolerance,
dispersal ability, ecological generalism, adaptive
potential) and extrinsic (e.g. climate velocity, habitat
heterogeneity, human pressures) mechanisms. Beyond
generating fundamental knowledge regarding the
range shift processes, BIOSHIFTS will also explore
the predictive utility of the identied mechanisms to
support eective climate^ astrategies for biodiversity
conservation. For more information about BIOSHIFTS:
https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-
action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bioshifts/
The post-doc is expected to: - Coordinate progress
and work in close cooperation with the dierent
BIOSHIFTS partners; - Contribute to the creation of a
fully functional geo-database integrating information
about range shift estimates, species traits, habitat
characteristics and study-level variables; - Lead the
development of the analytical framework, drawing
upon state-of-the-art phylogenetic comparative and
macroevolutionary methods as well as trait-based and
meta-analytical approaches; - Lead the dissemination of
project results including writing scientic articles and
presentation of the results at international conferences.
Qualications We are looking for a highly motivated
post-doctoral researcher with strong background in
global change biology, concepts in data synthesis science
and macroevolution, who is excited about research ques-
tions pertaining to range shifts processes and biodiver-

Montpellier StructuralGenomics
Postdoc position in Genomics and Bioinformatics
Key-words : Structural genomics - meiotic recombina-
tion - machine learning Duration: 3 years - starting
February 2022 Laboratory: DIADE, a joint research
unit between IRD, University of Montpellier and Cirad
Location: Montpellier, France
Applications should be sent by e-mail to the contact
hereby, not later than Nov. 31, 2021. Contact: math-
ias.lorieux@ird.fr Required skill for applicants: PhD
in genomics, bioinformatics or applied mathematics.
Mathematical modeling. Machine learning. Spoken and
written English
Description of the position: In meiotic recombination,
crossing overs (CO) do not occur randomly along chro-
mosomes. The laws that control CO location are still
poorly understood, although many studies have been de-
voted to them. The central question we wish to answer
- using rice, Oryza sativa L., as a model - in this project
is:Does ne knowledge of the structural dierences
between two genomes make it possible to accurately
predict the probability of occurrence of recombination
(or CO) events in the meiosis in the F1 hybrid of these
two genomes?
To answer this question, the postdoc fellow will be
involved in all or part of the following activities: (1) de-
velop a method for the automatic identication and clas-
sication of the set of structural variants (SV) between
two distant genomes, (2) estimate local recombination in
a population of 2,000 F2 individuals descended from the
F1 hybrid between the distant genomes, (3) establish
rules of causality between SV and local recombination,
using machine learning methods, and (4) establish a pre-
dictive model of recombination in a hybrid as a function
of the genomic sequence of the parents of the hybrid.
This project is part of a larger ANR grant aiming at
studying meiotic recombination. All the resources -
crosses, DNAs, sequences - necessary to the project
have already been produced. The DIADE research Unit
at IRD has a strong background and many collabora-
tions - both national and international - in the eld of
genomics and bioinformatics. Montpellier oers a very
complete scientic environment in these research elds.
Montpellier is a very attractive multi-cultural, dynamiccity, located near the Mediterranean sea

ModelingGeneDrive
Postdoc: Modeling Gene Drive and Evolution of Insec-
ticide Resistance in Mosquitoes
OVERVIEW: We have funding from NIH for a project
titled \Combining Aedes aegypti genomics and modeling
to improve gene drive strategies and our understanding
of insecticide resistance evolution". Aedes aegypti is136 EvolDir November 1, 2021
the primary vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and
urban yellow-fever. We are searching for a postdoc to
work on the modeling aspects of the project.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The idea of using self-
ish genetic elements to drive specic transgenes into
a mosquito population either to reduce its size or to
render it unable to transmit a particular pathogen was
proposed over 40 years ago. It is only recently, however,
with the advent of CRISPR-based gene editing tech-
nology, that this approach has gained broad attention
from researchers and the news media. The need for this
new technology is in part due to evolution of mosquito
resistance to insecticides.
The most straightforward approaches for building gene
drives using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are theoreti-
cally expected to result in spread of the gene drive to
individuals in all populations that are connected by
even minimal gene ow. These approaches are appro-
priate in some cases, but detailed mathematical models
are needed to understand the dynamics of spread and
the potential for resistance evolving to the gene drive
mechanisms. Our group and others have proposed more
complex approaches for developing gene drives that are
spatially and/or temporally limited. Novel molecular
approaches accompanied by modeling are needed for
development of these limited gene drives.
We currently have a detailed spatial model that simu-
lates the population dynamics and population genetics
of Ae. aegypti in a city, Iquitos, in the Amazonian re-
gion of Peru. There are rich data sets on both mosquito
dynamics and dengue epidemiology that have been col-
lected in this city. One important characteristic of this
mosquito is limited among house movement and strong
population structure. A main goal of our NIH grant
is to modify this model to explore how and to what
extent population structure will impact insecticide resis-
tance evolution and the performance of novel gene drive
strategies.

JOB DESCRIPTION: The postdoc in this position will
lead eorts on modifying the detailed model and uti-
lizing it to test hypotheses. The postdoc will have the
option of also conceptualizing and developing general
models to evaluate novel approaches for building spa-
tially/temporally limited gene drives. Our project is
strengthened by collaborations with a number of labs in
the US and in Peru, and activity in the Genetic Engi-
neering and Society Center at NC State that examines
societal aspects of novel genetic technologies. The post-doc will interact with members of these other research
groups. If desired, there will be an opportunity for some
work in Peru and for mentoring undergraduate and grad-
uate students. The appointment is for two-years with
the potential to write new grants for extension beyond
that period.
QUALIFICATIONS: We are looking for a postdoc with
a solid background in population biology and popula-
tion genetics who has experience with modeling and who
wants to do applied research. Experience with C++ or

Postdoctoral Position
Evolutionary Genetics of Host Responses to Emerging
Infectious Disease
Research in the Waldman lab at the Department of In-
tegrative Biology at Oklahoma State University focuses
on the interaction of disease, adaptive immune function,
and the evolution of behavioral strategies in response
to emerging infectious pathogens.
Our recent studies have demonstrated that Asian am-
phibians are resistant to the amphibian chytrid pathogen
whereas species elsewhere vary in their resistance or tol-
erance. These dierences map to variation in the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC). Host population
structure and patterns of assortative mating vary with
MHC type and pathogen prevalence. Particular MHC
alleles appear to confer disease resistance but incur other
tness costs. These tradeos vary not only with MHC
type but also pathogen variants and host microbiomes.
We seek a postdoctoral associate with a good ground-
ing in modern methods of population genomics to join
our research group. Our research is global in scope,
incorporating comparisons of host/pathogen relation-
ships among amphibians in North America, Asia, and
Oceania. The successful candidate will be involved with
projects involving graduate students but also will have
ample opportunities to develop their own projects. In-
teractions with colleagues internationally along with
members of our department are encouraged. The De-
partment of Integrative Biology has 28 faculty whose
research addresses three main research themes: ecology,
evolution, and environmental stress, all key aspects of
our project.
Candidates should have a demonstrated research record
incorporating molecular genetics and evolutionary or
conservation biology. Initial appointment is for one year,
with expectation for renewal given satisfactory progress.
The start date can be negotiated.
Oklahoma State University is a Carnegie Tier 1 re-
search university with excellent facilities for research

lutionary Genetics, CNRS UMR2000) is recruiting a
post-doctoral researcher in quantitative and population
genetics at Institut Pasteur, Paris. Our research is fo-
cused on how natural selection, human demography
and lifestyle have shaped the patterns of diversity of
the human genome and, ultimately, phenotype varia-
tion and disease risk (https://research.pasteur.fr/en/-
team/human-evolutionary-genetics/). Specically, our
projects aim to increase our understanding of (i) the
genetic and evolutionary determinants of phenotype
variation, (ii) the occurrence of natural selection, in
its dierent forms and (iii) the demography history of
human populations, with a focus on Africa and the
Pacic.
The current postdoc project will be focused on exploring
both the genetic architecture of phenotype variation in
Polynesians (height, metabolic functions, skin pigmen-
tation, immune response, etc.) and the evolutionary
mechanisms that aect their distribution. The objec-
tive is to determine if population dierences in these
quantitative traits are the result of genetic drift or past
or ongoing directional selection, a question that is key
to understand human health disparities in the Pacic.
This proposal, which combines quantitative genetics,
population genetics, computational modelling and the
development of statistical frameworks, will shed new
light into the mechanisms of human genetic adaptation,
during their last journey into uninhabited lands.
Requirements: - Ph.D. in quantitative genomics, sta-
tistical genetics, population genetics, bioinformatics,
or computational biology - Strong programming and
bioinformatics skills (R and Bash scripting, cluster com-
puting) - Prociency in English.
Duration: 2 years funding are available, and support will
be provided to become self-nanced through competitive
fellowship applications.
Application Procedure: E-mail a CV, motivation let-
ter and three reference names (in a single pdf le) to
quintana@pasteur.fr by **November 30, 2021**.140 EvolDir November 1, 2021
Please put \Postdoc Quantitative Genetics" in the sub-
ject line of your email. Interviews will be held soon after
this date. The starting date can be any time during
spring 2021.

ConservationGenomics
The Hamilton Lab (http://jillahamilton.com/-
index.html) at Pennsylvania State University is seeking
to hire a postdoctoral research associate to contribute
to an NSF-Plant Genome funded research program
studying the genomic basis of climate adaptation in
Poplar hybrids. The project includes a large collabora-
tion Virginia Tech, University of Vermont, University
of Maryland and ArbNet (Morton Arboretum). The
researcher will analyze full-genome resequencing data
from Poplar clones of mixed ancestry (P. trichocarpa x
P. balsamifera) alongside phenotypic data (phenology
and other), and climatic data from Poplar planted in
replicated common gardens established in arboreta
across the United States as part of the PopUpPoplar
Network (http://popup-poplars.com/index.html).
The post-doctoral position is highly interdisciplinary,
combining phenotypic data across a broad range of
environments and genome resequencing to identify
regions of the genome that contribute disproportionately
to phenotypic dierences across varying ancestral
backgrounds and environments. A major goal will be
to build upon new methods combining spatial modeling
of adaptive genetic variation with genome-phenotypic
associations to identify genetic variation that may
indicate pre-adaptation to novel climate conditions.
The position requires a Ph.D. in forestry, evolution-
ary biology, population genomics, quantitative genetics,
bioinformatics, or a related eld, and the applicant
must be able to provide evidence that all requirements
have been met for the completion of the PhD. prior to
the eective date of hire. Familiarity with analyzing
whole-genome resequence data and expertise using bioin-
formatic tools to infer genomic structure is necessary,
as well as experience using Unix or Linux environments.
The postdoctoral fellow will be expected to analyze
genomic, phenotypic and climatic datasets, lead prepa-
ration and publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts,
present ndings from the research project, and con-tribute to outreach associated with the project. In
addition, there will be ample opportunity to pursue
research questions besides those of the particular study.
Interested applicants should submit a cover letter de-
scribing research interests and experience, a curriculum
vitae, and contact information for three professional
references to the WorkDay link below. This is a xed-
term position funded for one year from date of hire
with an excellent possibility of renewal for multiple ad-
ditional years. This position will be located at Penn
State in University Park. Review of applications will be-
gin immediately and continue until the position is lled.

ing clear / understandable scientic prose as evidenced
by a writing sample.
I'd be very happy to see applications from people who
have left academia and are interested to come back. If
you are not sure if you qualify, please reach out!
I hope to nd someone who can start soon (Nov or Dec
1st 2021).
Why this is a great opportunity: These are two cool
projects in a productive lab (see my Google Scholar
prole). You can expect to get several papers out of
this short postdoc.

What is the role of individualisation in the extinction
or persistence of biological populations in changing en-
vironments or for the dynamics and consequences of an
infection (e.g., through SarsCov2)? How does individual
variation (i.e., individuality and heterogeneity) inuence

UCalifornia SanDiego Microbiomes
A postdoctoral position is available in the Jackrel Lab in
the Division of Biological Sciences - Section of Ecology,
Behavior and Evolution at UC San Diego. Start date is
exible. The position is available for one year, and re-
newable for up to four years dependent on progress. This
candidate will pursue avenues related to an NIH-funded
research program aimed at advancing our understanding
of the role of host genetics and the environment in reg-
ulating assembly of microbial communities, short-term
changes in these communities through ecological succes-
sion, and long-term changes through evolutionary pro-cesses. In order to better understand complex biological
networks, our lab seeks to elucidate the underlying struc-
ture of ecological interactions within host microbiomes
in order to predict when and how microbiomes might
confer benecial versus deleterious functions associated
with their host. Our lab aims to advance fundamental
understanding of host-microbiomes by leveraging single-
celled eukaryotic phytoplankton as a highly-tractable
experimental system. We seek a postdoctoral scholar
to:
(1) Harness the diversity of phytoplankton with bacterial
-omics approaches to test how microbiomes assemble in
response to host genetics. Use bacterial gene expression
responses to host genetics, in tandem with uctuating
environmental conditions, to determine the host genetic
x environmental forces that drive microbiome assembly
of eukaryotic microbiomes.
(2) Evaluate mechanisms of microbiome change for main-
tenance of host homeostasis in uctuating environments,
including ecological shifts in bacterial taxonomic compo-
sition, shifts in bacterial gene expression, and bacterial
strain evolution.
(3) Leverage classic community ecology theory to char-
acterize traits of transient versus stable microbiome net-
works. Quantify bacteria-bacteria interaction strengths
within naturally assembled and engineered microbiomes
to understand how network structure contributes to
transitions between host health and disease states.
Qualications:
- Ph.D. or equivalent degree in Microbiology, Ecology,
Evolution, Genetics or related elds.
- Expertise in one or more of the following is desired (and
broadly dened): empirical community ecology, eld
and lab-based environmental microbiology, bacterial
gene surveys, metagenomics, or metatranscriptomics.
- Familiarity with R for statistical analyses and data
visualization.
- Ability to work independently to conduct an indepen-
dent research project, as well as willingness to mentor
graduate and undergraduate students.
Please email Sara Jackrel at sjackrel@ucsd.edu with
any questions and to apply. Email applications should
include:
- A cover letter that summarizes past research and how
your interests t with the lab.
- CV with complete publication list, including a list of

Postdoctoral fellowship in statistical and population
genomics From correlations to explanations: towards a
new European prehistory (COREX)
We invite applications for a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Copenhagen, as part of the COREX syn-
ergy project. Synergy projects represent the top level of
European Research Council funding, with a budget of
euro 10 million over six years. In the project \From cor-
relations to explanations: towards a new European pre-
history (COREX)" geneticists and archaeologists from
the University College London (led by Mark Thomas
and Stephen Shennan) join forces with archaeologists
from Gothenburg (led by Kristian Kristiansen and Karl
G oran-Sj ogren), and geneticists from Copenhagen (led
by Kurt Kj ~Ar, Eske Willerslev and Fernando Racimo).
The project will combine prehistoric human genomic, ar-
chaeological, environmental, stable isotope and climate
data to better understand the processes that shaped our
biological and cultural past from the time of the rst
farmers to the Iron Age.
The candidate will be advised by Assoc. Prof. Fer-
nando Racimo, whose research group focuses on using
ancient and present-day DNA to understand patterns
of selection and admixture over time, in combination
with archaeological and paleo-environmental data, and
to develop methods to infer dynamic population pro-
cesses while accounting for both spatial and temporal
variation.
OBJECTIVES
The candidate will be able to work with unprecedent-
edly large ancient genomic, archaeological and paleo-
vegetation datasets from a period spanning the last
10,000 years of West Eurasian history. The focus ofthe project will be on performing exploratory analy-
ses and developing computational models to connect
population genetic processes (population expansions,
migrations and admixture), patterns of material culture
distribution (i.e. diusion of technology and art forms),
environmental factors (climate, ecozones, subsistence
strategy and the presence of pathogens), sedimentary
DNA and demographic data (such as population density
estimates from radiocarbon date density data). This
will be done using a variety of geostatistically-aware
models that account for auto-correlations in both space
and time.
This will serve as a pioneer example of how to build
statistically-supported conceptual bridges between ar-
chaeological and genetic inference. Our project will
serve to determine what the impact of the movement of
people was on the European landscape, simultaneously
on multiple scales: continental, regional and local.
The fully funded postdoctoral fellowship will be carried
out at the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre, a
unique center of research excellence in Denmark, with
the aim to understand the evolution of complex traits
using ancient DNA. The candidate will have to opportu-
nity to collaborate with leaders in the elds of paleoge-
nomics, sedimentary DNA and archaeology, including
Mark Thomas, Stephen Shennan, Kristian Kristiansen,
Kurt Kj ~Ar, Karl G oran-Sj ogren, Eske Willerslev, Ralph
Fyfe, Karin Frei and Jesse Woodbridge. The University
of Copenhagen is a world-leading institution of higher
learning and provides excellent programs in genetics,
archaeology, statistics, computer science and mathemat-
ics.
QUALIFICATIONS
The candidate will have a PhD degree or equivalent doc-
torate, with a background in one or more of the following
areas: statistics, data science, evolutionary biology, pop-
ulation genetics, computational biology, bioinformatics
and/or mathematics. The ideal candidate will demon-
strate a working prociency in one or more programming
languages commonly used in data science (e.g. experi-
ence in Python, R, C/C++, Java or Julia) and have
experience in the UNIX operating environment.
SALARY AND TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT
The employment as postdoc is a full time and xed-
term position for three years. Starting date 1 March
2022 or after mutual agreement. Salary, pension and
terms of employment will be in accordance with the
agreement between the Danish Ministry of Finance and
AC (Danish Confederation of Professional Associations).
Currently, the monthly salary starts at 35,915 DKK/
approx. 4,829 Euro (October 2021-level). Depending154 EvolDir November 1, 2021
on qualications, a supplement may be negotiated. The

Two four-year postdoctoral positions are available at
the University of Edinburgh, to join the research group
of Professor Loeske Kruuk. The project will investigate
the evolutionary dynamics of wild animal populations,
using data from seven long-term mammal studies to ex-
plore determinants of tness and the eects of ongoing
environmental change in natual populations.
Position 1 will focus on an analysis of tness. The
aims are to investigate the concept of tness and its
measurement in the genomics era, to quantify genetic
and non-genetic causes of variance in tness, including
the impact of indirect genetic eects and social evolu-
tion, and to explore the use of genomic data to estimate
rates of evolutionary adaptation in wild populations.
Position 2 will focus on the eects of ongoing environ-November 1, 2021 EvolDir 155
mental change on natural populations. The aims are to
determine the impact on the process of natural selec-
tion on phenotypic traits and the ecological eects of
changing environmental conditions, to assess the genetic
and environmental basis of change in key phenotypic
traits, and to use genomic prediction to test for adaptive
evolutionary change. The project will use data from
the long-term studies of several dierent wild mam-
mal populations: bighorn sheep (Canada), eastern grey
kangaroos and Tasmanian devils (Australia), spotted
hyenas (Tanzania), meerkats (South Africa), and red
deer and Soay sheep (Scotland). Analysis will combine
detailed measures of life-history and phenotypic trait
variation with pedigree and genomic data and long-term
environmental monitoring.
Applicants should have a PhD in evolutionary ecology
or genetics, or something similar, and be familiar with
quantitative genetic concepts and analysis. Experience
in management and analysis of complex data sets, in-
cluding genomic data, would be advantageous. The
project is funded by a European Research Council Ad-
vanced Grant, and involves collaboration with multiple
colleagues and institutions worldwide. Start date Jan-
uary 2022, or as soon as possible after that.
The Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the University

expertise in evolutionary genomics.
Ongoing research in the group of Karine Van Doninck
involves topics at the core of evolutionary biology, in-
cluding the evolution of sex, genome maintenance, re-
combination and extreme stress resistance on dierent
eukaryotic systems, including rotifers, amoeba and Cor-
bicula clams. We are employing dierent tools (including
experimental ecology, population genetics, phylogeny,
comparative genomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics,
molecular and cellular biology) to study evolutionary
processes at the level of populations, both experimental
and natural, and genomes.
The recruited candidate will integrate the ERC CoG
entitled \Rotifers highlight the evolution of asexuals

genomes of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga were ob-
tained by the team of Karine Van Doninck (Flot et al.,
2013 Nature and Simion et al., 2021 Science Advances)
and additional chromosome-scale genome assemblies
of dierent species are being obtained. More recently,
Karine Van Doninck and her team have also started
to explore the molecular mechanisms making bdelloid
rotifers unique in terms of hyper-resistance to desicca-
tion, freezing and ionizing radiation. Both desiccation
and radiation induce massive genome breakage (termed
\genothripsis) that bdelloid rotifers can repair, recon-

assemble chromosome-scale genomes of dierent rotifer
species, including bdelloids, monogononts, seisonids and
Acantocephala following the pipeline we have used in
our manuscript Simion et al., 2021 Science Advances.
The rotifer samples have been obtained, cultured and158 EvolDir November 1, 2021
most DNA extractions have been done. The selected
candidate involved in this ERC project RHEA will be
responsible for assembling and annotating the genomes
of dierent rotifer species. The candidate will then
perform comparative approaches to explore genome evo-

ULodz VertebrateEvolution
Postdoc: EXILE - University of A odAo- Department
of Ecology and Vertebrate Zoology
REMINDER - DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF
APPLICATIONS: 20 October 2021
An exciting postdoctoral position funded by the Pol-
ish National Science Centre (NCN, grant EXILE) is
available at the Department of Ecology and Verte-
brate Zoology of the University of A odAo(Poland)
under the supervision of Philippe Kok (STELLAR Re-
search Group, see http://www.philippekok.com/stellar-
research-group/). The position is oered for one year,
renewable for two further periods of one year (thus max
3 years) and is available from January 2022.
Brief scientic summary of the project: While poten-
tial responses of vertebrate communities to environ-
mental constraints have been widely tested in post-
Pleistocene landscapes, extrinsic and intrinsic drivers160 EvolDir November 1, 2021
of vertebrate population density in ancient insular ter-
restrial landscapes (fragmented paleosurfaces) are es-
sentially unknown. The overarching objective of this
project (acronym EXILE for EXobIoLogy on Earth)
is to explore, document and understand how environ-
mentally hostile naturally fragmented paleosurfaces may
have driven/altered peculiar behavioural, bio-physical
and eco-physiological adaptations, and ultimately the
evolutionary trajectories of vertebrates. EXILE fo-
cusses on the \Lost World" moonlike tabletop moun-
tains of northern South America (tepuis). We hypothe-
size that ancient endemic lineages of vertebrates thriv-
ing on these paleosurfaces, such as the toad genus
Oreophrynella and the lizard genus Riolama, have
developed unique behavioural, bio-physical and eco-
physiological traits/strategies to cope with the tepuis'
highly contrasted environmental conditions. EXILE
stems from our previous work in this unique system
and was inspired by unconventional ndings, testimony
to the tremendous research discoveries yet to be made
in this unusual ecosystem. It is well known that body
temperature and water balance are jointly inuenced by
heat and water exchange within the organism and be-
tween the organism and its environment. This exchange
is modulated by (i) the biophysical and physiological
properties of the organism and by (ii) behavioural strate-
gies. Biophysical properties include morphology, surface
properties, and metabolic modes. For instance, skin
colour, thickness, and ultrastructure in reptiles and am-
phibians determine heating capacity and resistance to
water loss. EXILE will specically focus on two main
complementary research axes: (1) thermal biology, and
(2) bio-physical adaptations to dehydration. We will
use selected Pantepui amphibians and reptiles on a sin-
gle tepui summit at ca. 2,800 m elevation. In order
to situate these results in the appropriate ecological
and evolutionary context, we will also investigate non-
insular upland (ca. 1,000 m elevation) closely-related
taxa in the surrounding Pantepui tropical rainforest,
as well as the closest relatives of the tepui taxa living
in a Neotropical post-Pleistocene landscape at similar
elevation (ca. 2,800 m elevation in the sub-paramo in
the Andes). Field expeditions coupled with the use of
advanced techniques such as highly sensitive thermal
imagery, including the use of drones to record thermal
images of the landscapes from the air, will be carried
out to complete our project. We will also run a va-
riety of cutting-edge behavioural tests, either in the
native environment of the animals or in our eld lab-
oratory, and use modern imagery techniques (such as
high-resolution X-ray microcomputed tomography and
electronic microscopy).
Summary for the public is available here: https://-ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/les/listy-rankingowe/2020-

UOulu UrbanEvolution
Postdoctoral Researcher, Evolution in Urban Environ-
ments
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Cities grow globally at an accelerating pace. Environ-
mental change due to urbanization is expected to increas-
ingly aect the evolution of extant species, potentially
in a climate-dependent way. Yet, the evolutionary con-
sequences of urbanization remain poorly understood,
which is a signicant problem in evolutionary biology. A
few specic and conspicuous examples, however, demon-
strate that urbanization-induced evolution takes place,
industrial melanism in moths being the classical example
of urban adaptation. This project will use a macro-scale
approach to comprehensively examine urban adaptation
and its climate-dependency by using Lepidoptera (but-
teries and moths) as study system. The project focuses
on four aspects of evolution in urban environments: (1)
life history adaptations to urban environments, (2) adap-
tations to light pollution, (3) physiological adaptationsto the urban thermal environment, and (4) the origins
of urban adaptations.
The project is nanced by Academy of Finland. Prin-
cipal Investigator of the project is Dr. Sami Kivel a
(University of Oulu, Finland). The project includes
collaboration with Dr. Marko Mutanen (University
of Oulu), Dr. Thomas Merckx (Free University of
Brussels, Belgium), Prof. Toomas Tammaru (Univer-
sity of Tartu, Estonia), Dr. Karl Gotthard and Dr.
Philipp Lehmann (Stockholm University, Sweden), Dr.
Peter Huemer (Tiroler Landesmuseen, Austria), and
Dr. Tom a ^A Kadlec (Czech University of Life Sciences,
Czech Republic).
You will participate in studies addressing all the research
themes of the project. A lot of samples and experimen-
tal data already exist, and your responsibilities as a
recruited postdoctoral researcher include processing of
samples (e.g. morphometric measurements of moth
specimens), analysing data and reporting results in col-
laboration with the rest of the research team members.
There will also be a possibility to analyse population
genetic (ddRADseq) data, to do some eld work and
run further experiments. You will also have teaching
duties at the department at most 5% of working time.
QUALIFICATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA
We expect you to have
- PhD in evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics or re-
lated elds. Please note that your degree should be
obtained within the last 10 years, latest by the start of
the employment.
- Excellent English communication skills

UOxford EvolutionWildBacteria
Postdoctoral Researcher on evolutionary dynamics in
wild bacterial communities
A three-year postdoctoral researcher position is avail-
able to investigate the tempo and mode of evolutionary
dynamics in wild bacteria communities. The project is
with Tim Barraclough and Kayla King in the Depart-
ment of Zoology, University of Oxford, and Thomas Bell
in the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College
London (Silwood Park campus).
Summary: How populations of bacteria evolve in lab-oratory experiments is well understood, but much less
is known about evolution in diverse communities in the
wild. Do bacteria adapt to their biotic surroundings?
Does ecological diversity constrain or promote evolution
of constituent species? This project aims to nd out
by applying well-developed approaches of experimental
evolution to whole communities in the lab and the eld.
The role: You will use a combination of metagenome
sequencing and experimental evolution to investigate
coevolutionary interactions within whole communities,
focusing on the bacteria that live in rainwater pools
formed by the roots of beach trees. The project is
funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.
The post-holder will spend time at both institutions
in a pattern that can be arranged exibly subject to
constraints on the timing of experiments. The position
oers opportunities to develop your own research in-
terests and collaborations within the department and
wider university. The post holder would provide guid-
ance to less experienced members of the research group,
including PhD and project students.
Qualications: Strong interests in evolutionary biology,
prior experience of microbial evolution working with ge-
nomic or metagenomic data and laboratory experiments,
and a PhD in a relevant area.
How to apply: Submit your application, CV and cov-
ering letter online via this link by 19th Nov 2021 12:00
Greenwich Mean Time.

Postdoctoral Researcher on transgenerational epigenetic
inheritance of insecticide resistance
A postdoctoral position is available in the Insect Agroe-
cology and Evolution Lab in the Department of Plant
and Soil Science at the University of Vermont (UVM),
led by Prof. Yolanda Chen, in collaboration with Prof.
Sean Schoville at the University of Wisconsin (UW),
Prof. Stephanie McKay (UVM) and Prof. Russell
Groves (UW).
Summary: Agricultural insect pests show a remarkable
ability to evolve resistance to insecticides. Although in-
secticide resistance is widely considered to be inevitable,
the evolutionary processes underlying the evolution of
insecticide resistance remain poorly understood. One
possible explanation is that insecticide exposure may
alter epigenetic modications, which alter heritable pat-
terns of gene expression without actually changing the
underlying DNA sequence. The Colorado potato beetle
(CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, has been extraordi-
narily successful at adapting to all insecticide classes,
including the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid. We
will test how beetle exposure to sublethal doses of imi-
dacloprid can alter multigenerational and transgenera-
tional epigenetic inheritance of insecticide tolerance.
Position Responsibilities: The postdoctoral associate
will be expected to manage a multigenerational beetle
breeding project, extract DNA/RNA, and analyze whole-
genome bisulte sequencing data from an experimental
evolution study. This will provide training opportunities
in bioinformatics analysis, genomic inheritance, and epi-
genetic analysis. The successful applicant will also help
in the mentoring of undergraduate student projects.
Qualications: Candidates are expected to have a Ph. D.
in Evolutionary Genomics, Molecular Ecology, Genetics,
Entomology, or related eld. Experience in analyzing
large bioinformatic datasets (reduced representation,
transcriptomic, or sequencing). Desirable skills for this
project include familiarity with Linux operating systems
and computer programming (Python, and R). Expe-
rience in DNA/RNA extraction, running PCRs, and
optimizing protocols.
How to Apply: Funding for this position is available for
two years with the possibility of an extension. To apply,
please send a single pdf with a cover letter demonstrat-170 EvolDir November 1, 2021

Dear all,
registration is now open for the 2nd edition of our course
\Computational Bayesian methods using brms in R".
Dates: Online, 14-18 FebruaryCourse website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course46/ )
This course provides a relatively accessible and techni-
cally non-demanding introduction to the basic workow
for tting dierent kinds of linear models using a pow-
erful front-end R package for Stan called brms.
We assume familiarity with R. Participants will benet
most if they have previously t linear models and lin-
ear mixed models (using lme4) in R, in any scientic
domain. No knowledge of calculus or linear algebra is
assumed, but basic school level mathematics knowledge
is assumed (this will be quickly revisited in class).
After completing this course, the participants will
1. have become familiar with the foundations of
Bayesian inference
2. be able to t a range of multiple regression models
and hierarchical models for normally distributed data,
for log-normal, and binomially distributed data.
3. be able to communicate the results of a Bayesian
analysis
4. know how to select priors for their models using prior
predictive checks
5. know how to assess the descriptive accuracy of a
model using posterior predictive checks.

UGroningen LifeHistoryTheory
Dec12-17
PhD course on Life History Theory, at the completely
rebuild Field station the Herdershut, Schiermonnikoog,
December 12-17 2021.
Life History Theory deals with species-specic adaptive
schemes of the distribution of the reproductive eort
over the life of an organism. The general theoretical
problem is to predict which combination of traits willevolve under specic conditions. The concepts used are
also relevant to study within species variation in life
history traits. The one week course aims at giving an
overview of the eld and will discuss methodology and
recent developments.
Contents & Structure
The subject will be worked out on the basis of lectures,
case histories, discussion and literature. Attention will
be paid to various groups of organisms such as birds,
shes, insects and plants. The contact with current
research projects is guaranteed as concrete examples
will be treated by scientists working in the eld. In
poster sessions work and/or plans of the participating
students will be discussed with the whole group and we
will use computers to illustrate some of the concepts.
Topics and Teachers will include but are not limited to:
Cost of reproduction, Optimality in evolutionary ecol-
ogy, Aging in a life history context (Simon Verhulst,
GELIFES)
Evolutionary genomics, Animal personalities (Kees van
Oers, NIOO)
Life-history evolution in social insects (Ido Pen,
GELIFES)
Age and size at maturity (Tom van Dooren, CNRS,
France)
We are happy to announce that as before we will have
two special guest lecturers. However, their names are
at this moment not yet conclusive.
For more information on the preliminary programme
and to register, please visit the course website
https://www.rug.nl/research/ecology-and-evolution/-
phdcourses/lifehistorytheory The course will be held
on the Dutch isle of Schiermonnikoog and starts
Sunday night the 12th of December and ends Friday
the 17th of December 2021. The registration fee is
euro 350,- for all participants belonging to the RSEE
and aliated research schools (PE&RC, WIMEK). All
other participants pay euro 500,-. This includes lodging,
meals, and the course material at the course venue.

To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
