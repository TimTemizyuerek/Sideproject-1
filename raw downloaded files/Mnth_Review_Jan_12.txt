Dear colleague,
We invite you to submit an abstract to the symposium
“Genomic basis of Evo-Devo” to take place at the meet-

http://www.smbe2012.org/scientiﬁc-content/call-
for-abstracts.html Symposium “Genomic basis of
Evo-Devo”
Genomics and Evo-Devo have provided many of the
most exciting advances in evolutionary biology in re-
cent years. The functional study of animal and plant
genomes, in terms of gene regulation and networks, is
now linking these two ﬁelds. This has the potential
to bridge the gap between adaptive and structural ap-
proaches to biodiversity, and participate in an extended
evolutionary synthesis. Moreover, new genomic tools
(e.g., cheap sequencing) mean that increasingly func-
tional studies can be done in classical plant and an-
imal models species in Evolutionary Biology. In this
session, we will focus on the study of changes at the
genome level, which aﬀect development, and conse-
quently morphology. We invite contributions from sci-
entists working on the genomics of emerging model or-
ganisms (sponge, bee, orchid, amphioxus, moss, etc.),
and on natural variation in established models of de-
velopmental biology (e.g., nematodes, fruit ﬂies, Ara-
bidopsis). Given this broad representation of speak-
ers, we expect a stimulating exchange between students
of molecular evolution, organismal evolution, genomics,
and evolution of development.

Dear colleague,
We invite you to submit an abstract to the symposium
“The complex relationship between orthology, paralogy,
and function” to take place at the meeting of the So-
ciety for Molecular Biology and Evolution in Dublin
(23rd-26th June, 2012).The deadline to submit an abstract is the 27th of Jan-

http://www.smbe2012.org/scientiﬁc-content/call-for-
abstracts.html Symposium “The complex relationship
between orthology, paralogy, and function”
Orthology and paralogy have been central concepts in
molecular evolution since the distinction was ﬁrst pro-
posed by Fitch in 1970. A long standing interpretation
of this distinction has been that orthologs would be
more similar in function than paralogs. Until recently,
this interpretation was rarely tested, and in fact rarely
explicitly articulated in a testable manner. Yet it has
been widely used, from undergraduate teaching, to the
practical application of orthology searches for genome
annotation. There has been a recent increase of re-
search, seeking to deﬁne and test this “ortholog con-
jecture”. Notably, a recent paper (Nehrt et al. 2011,
PloS Comput. Biol.) has reported a higher functional
similarity of paralogs than of orthologs. This paper
has generated much attention and debate, while at the
same time recent work on orthologs has shown the vi-
tality and importance of this ﬁeld to a broad range of
applications and questions. Our symposium will fea-
ture speakers addressing the fundamental relationships
between molecular evolution and biological function, fo-
cusing especially on the role of orthology and paralogy
in modulating such relationships.

EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRES-
SION
RNA-Seq has revolutionized the ﬁeld of comparative
biology by allowing molecular proﬁling across organ-
isms, even those without a reference genome sequence,
thereby enabling the study of transcriptome evolution
within large taxonomic groups. Large-scale compar-
ative expression datasets are now becoming available,
motivating the development of models and analytical
techniques to investigate the process of expression evo-
lution. The ﬁeld is now positioned to address funda-
mental questions passionately discussed within the past
decade, such as: - What is the contribution of gene
expression changes to phenotypic variation and diver-
gence? - What are the most common mechanisms of
gene expression divergence? - How do drift and se-
lection contribute to gene expression divergence across
species, tissues, and developmental stages? In this sym-
posium we hope to bring together researchers with a va-
riety of perspectives working on these questions using
diﬀerent models to debate and contrast ﬁndings, con-
sider new directions for the ﬁeld, discuss standardiza-
tion of methods for sample collection, treatment, data
processing, and data sharing.

Symposium on Evolutionary Networks: Proteins,
Genomes, OrganismsEvolutionary biology is studied at various scales from
genes to biochemical pathways, cells, organisms, and
societies, and aims to identify the processes that gen-
erate and maintain the impressive diversity observed
at all these levels. The vast amount of biological data
generated from high throughput technologies in the last
decade revealed that many of those systems are charac-
terized by complex interactions between various entities
such as proteins, genomes and organisms. Networks
(graphs) oﬀer a general model to the study of struc-
ture and evolution of complex systems as they support
diﬀerent levels of abstraction for the description of pat-
terns in the data and enable testing various hypotheses
regarding the system behaviour. For example, network
approaches revealed that the number of interactions of
a protein within the cell, or an organism within the so-
ciety is correlated with evolutionary observables such
as substitution rates or extinction probability. This
symposium will include presentations of network ap-
proaches in the evolutionary study of proteins, genomes
and societies, with an emphasis on the evolution of net-
work topology and community structure.

fective population sizes also combine to make viruses
remarkable models for evolution in general. They para-

sium seeks to explore host-virus coevolution, consider-
ing changes in virulence, prevalence, and host range
by exploring intersections between molecular evolu-
tion, molecular epidemiology, and phylogenetics. The
small genomes of viruses permit recovery of tremen-
dous amounts of sequence data from natural popula-
tions, while the rapid evolution of viruses has made
them favorites for experimental evolution. The results
of this work have not only illuminated a range of funda-
mental questions in genetics and evolutionary biology,
but also have direct medical relevance.

Symposium on Microbial Genome Evolution High-
throughput sequencing makes it possible for the ﬁrst
time to sequence hundreds of microbial genomes rapidly
at low cost. These methods have huge potential to sig-
niﬁcantly improve our understanding of microbial evo-
lution, so that many research projects have recently
been set up to generate and analyze such data. This
symposium will provide an overview of the progress
made by such projects, as well as the many challenges
they pose. It is now possible to identify the vast ma-
jority of SNPs within large population samples of mi-
crobial isolates. These datasets are illuminating the
molecular, ecological and population-level dynamic pro-
cesses occurring over short time scales in natural pop-
ulations inhabiting a range of habitats from the clinic
to the environment. We aim to explore these recent
advances and the development of new methods of anal-
yses required to fully exploit these extremely large se-
quence datasets. Relevant topics include quantifying
the variation in the rates of recombination and muta-
tion between closely related lineages, the evolution ofbase composition, the relative power of drift and selec-
tion, examining the acquisition of adaptive traits (e.g.
antibiotic resistance, host adaptation, metabolic ﬂexi-
bility, regulatory changes) within a phylogenetic frame-
work, and the distribution of variation over time and
space (phylogeography). The role of phage and con-
jugative elements in structuring populations as both
vehicles for gene ﬂow and parasitic elements will also
be considered. The symposium will focus on variation
within natural populations rather than experimental
evolution.

We are pleased to announce that the registration for
the 2012 Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
Meeting, taking place in Dublin 23-26 June 2012, and
the abstract submission for the Molecular, Genomic,
and Phenotypic Evolvability Symposium, are now open.
*Molecular, Genomic, and Phenotypic Evolvability*
*Symposium summary:* Evolvability is the capacity of
organisms to undergo adaptation by means of natural
selection. More than merely the ﬂip side of evolutionary
constraint, evolvability is a key concept in its own right
that extends the modern synthesis into new territory.
In this symposium we will examine the concept of evolv-
ability in depth. We have chosen world-class speakers
who will present data bearing on evolvability at vari-
ous levels (sequence, gene, gene network, gene family,
genome, and phenotype) and sharpen the deﬁnitions of
evolvability at each level. These talks will relate evolv-
ability to its components including robustness, mod-
ularity, buﬀering, facilitated variation, developmental
compartmentalization, and the relation between geno-
type and phenotype. A key question for evolution-
ary biology is whether the components of evolvability
are themselves evolvable or whether they are emergent
properties of complex biological systems evolving under
natural selection in an ever-changing environment.

Symposium on Population Genetic Inference from
Next-generation Sequencing Data:
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable
scientists to generate large-scale DNA sequence data
sets for model or non-model organisms. These large se-
quence data sets have become an important resource for
population genetic studies and empowered researches to
address fundamental questions in molecular and evolu-
tionary biology.
This new scientiﬁc environment creates new challenges.
Are available population genetics methods applicable
to these new generation data? How can we incorpo-
rate sequence errors, genotype uncertainty and ascer-
tainment bias in data analysis? The scale of NGS data
and the need to model sequencing errors and low se-
quence coverage have driven the development of new
computational and statistical methods for data analy-
sis and hypothesis testing. These methods range from
genome scans to infer selection at single loci or at a com-
bination of several loci to likelihood-based, Bayesian
and Approximate Bayesian Computation methods for
inferring demography.
This symposium will cover current research on the de-
velopment and application of new algorithms and sta-tistical models for population genetic analysis of large
DNA sequence data sets. Speciﬁcally, the symposium
will present recently developed methods for identify-
ing variant sites, calling genotypes, estimating the site
frequency spectrum, inferring past population demog-
raphy and detecting selection.

please apply.

RNA silencing and heterochromatin as genome defence:
TE’s, Viruses and Selﬁsh Elements
We invite anyone working on an evolutionary or com-
parative aspect of RNA silencing to submit an abstract
for this symposium, which will form a part of the SMBE
meeting in Dublin on the 23rd-26th June 2012.
The deadline for abstracts is the 27th Jan 2012 (see
http://www.smbe2012.org/ for more details)
Suitable topics include (but are not limited to): *
Transposable-element related RNAi pathways (such as
piRNAs) * Antiviral RNAi pathways (such as viRNAs,
but also miRNAs) * Viral supressors of RNAi * RNA-
directed heterochromatin * Molecular evolution / pop-
ulation genetics of RNAi * Phylogenetic origins / com-
parative genomics of related pathways * Experimental
evolution of RNAi * Theoretical models of RNAi evo-
lution
Symposium detail:
RNA silencing provides adaptive immunity against
viruses and transposable elements, and its discovery has
provided new insight into the co-evolutionary dynam-
ics of hosts and parasites. In addition, the link between
RNA silencing and heterochromatin suggests that these
dynamics may have a broad inﬂuence on the evolution
of gene expression, genome structure and reproductive
isolation.
Although studies in diverse taxa ranging from protistsJanuary 1, 2012 EvolDir 7
and plants to fungi and animals show that genome de-
fence by RNA silencing and heterochromatin is ancient,
evolutionary studies show that this defence mechanism
can also evolve quickly in an evolutionary ’arms race’
context.
This symposium will bring together recent work seek-
ing to describe the nature of these dynamics from both
molecular and evolutionary perspectives, and talks will
be drawn from a wide range of approaches (experi-
mental, theoretical, comparative) and study systems
(plants, animals, fungi, viruses)

Durham NC Phenotype Feb23-25
Phenotype RCN meeting announcement: Feb. 23-25,
2012 We would like to invite interested researchers to
participate in the second annual summit meeting of the
Phenotype Ontology RCN. The meeting will be held at
the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham,
NC, February 23-25, 2012.
The Phenotype Ontology RCN ( http://-
phenotypercn.org ) was funded by NSF to establish
a network of scientists who need to use or develop
phenotype ontologies. In contrast to the many well-
established ontologies in the molecular community, the
representation of morphology, behavior and other phe-
notypic traits using ontologies is in its infancy. Such
ontologies, however, have the potential to integrate
phenotype with data across all levels of the biological
hierarchy. This RCN is building a community that,
because of itsdomain expertise, sets the standards
and best practices for the development of phenotype
ontologies and a vision for their utility.
The main focus of this meeting will be introduce and es-
tablish communication between scientists from several
diﬀerent research backgrounds including comparative
evolutionary biologists, model organism biologists, ap-
plied scientists, andontology developers and logicians.
We will be introducing concepts involved in developing
and coordinating ontologies as well as ontology anno-tation.
Although funding is limited for this meeting, we can
help you reserve a room at the conference rate. Please
contact one of us if you are interested in attending.

SexDeterminationEvolution Jun6-9
Conference/workshop Sex-determination systems:
mechanisms and evolution.
La Sage, Switzerland, June 6-9, 2012
Theme: Sex determination can be achieved through an
impressive diversity of mechanisms. Many species (in-
cluding some ﬁsh and reptiles) display environmental
sex determination (with a switch determined by e.g.
temperature, age, social cues, etc). If genetic, sex de-
termination may be polygenic (many genes on diﬀerent
chromosomes) or monogenic (one single master gene).
The latter case may lead to the evolution of highly
diﬀerentiated sex chromosomes (as observed in birds
or mammals), but not necessarily so. What are the
mechanisms underlying alternative sex determination
pathways, what are their costs and beneﬁts (in par-
ticular regarding sex-ratio production), what are their
consequences in terms of demographic processes or ge-
nomic evolution? What selective forces drive transi-
tions among systems, which seem frequent on an evo-
lutionary time scale?
Form: Three-days conference/workshop in the Alps
(http://www.hoteldelasage.ch/ ) with the following in-
vited speakers: D.Bachtrog, C.Peichel, J.Mank,
N.Valenzuela, M.Kirkpatrick, E.Haag, L.Beukeboom.
Participants will have the opportunity to present and
discuss their work.
Fees: Euros 350.- including registration, food and ac-
commodation.
Inscription: limited to 30 participants. Please send a
brief CV and motivation statement by the end of Jan-
uary 2012 to nicolas.perrin@unil.ch

We are happy to announce the symposium
?Adaptive landscape genetics: current insights and fu-
ture directions?
on February 7th and 8th 2012 at the University of
Neuchatel (Switzerland).
see: www.unine.ch/ALG2012 Landscape genetics is
an integrative ﬁeld of research, aiming at understand-
ing microevolutionary processes across natural popula-
tions. It is developing in a rapid way due to advances in
genomics technologies, environmental data acquisition
and statistical methods to associate them.
During this symposium, we intend to foster exchange
between researchers having complementary expertise in
order to further explore the contributions of landscape
genetics to the assessment of the interactions between
environment and adaptive genetic variation in natu-ral populations. Invited speakers and contributed talks
will oﬀer an overview of current trends in the ﬁeld and
perspectives on how it will grow and develop in the
future.
Invited speakers are: Malika Ainouche (Univ. Rennes,

—–
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that registration is open
for the 2012 Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithol-
ogy ’Ecology and Evolution’ Student Conference, to be
held on 4th to 6th January 2012.
The conference will take place in the University of Ox-
ford at the Department of Zoology, and it is the aim
of the conference to provide a setting for students of
various research areas within ecology and evolution to
present and discuss their work in a constructive atmo-
sphere composed mainly of their peers. In addition to
student talks and posters, the conference will consist of
a number of plenary talks given by distinguished inves-
tigators. This year will see the conference broaden its
scope to embrace ideas derived from non-ornithological
systems, oﬀering the ideal opportunity for interaction

PopulationDynamics
PhD Postion in the School of Biological and Biomedical
Sciences, Durham University UK:18 EvolDir January 1, 2012
Holocene population dynamics and connectivity of top
predator species in the context of environmental change
This project will focus on the lynx (Lynx lynx), but
include comparator species as possible. Predators are
sensitive to changes in habitat or prey distribution and
abundance, and such changes may impact on their pop-
ulation dynamics, dispersal behaviour and distribution.
The primary aims are to test the following hypothe-
ses. 1) The distribution of diversity and pattern of
connectivity has been impacted by environmental fac-
tors such as climate change and deforestation during
the course of the Holocene for a top predator like the
lynx. 2) There is a relationship between historical envi-
ronmental change and the population dynamics of top
predators in Europe such that habitat change or loss
is reﬂected in periods of local demographic responses.
Similar studies of e.g. bison and musk ox have shown
that both climate change and anthropogenic factors
have been important in driving population dynamics
throughout the Holocene. Ancient DNA and coales-
cent methods will be used to determine mutation rate
in the mtDNA control region. The mutation rate es-
timate will then be used in Bayes factor and Bayesian
skyline plot analyses (a method that tracks coalescent
points back through time; implemented in the program
BEAST) to track regional population dynamics over
time, and coalescent analyses will be used to assess di-
rectional migration rates at contemporary time periods
in the past. This will be reinforced using complemen-
tary analyses (such as mismatch distributions, spatial
autocorrelation and conventional F-statistics).
Application materials including a c.v., two letters of
reference, a cover letter and University transcripts
should be sent to Rus Hoelzel (project supervisor) at
a.r.hoelzel@dur.ac.uk no later than February 3rd, 2012.
You will also need to apply online for admis-
sion to the University of Durham in advance
of that date ( https://bannerss.dur.ac.uk/blive ssb/-

A full studentship will be available comparable to
that provided by British Research Councils, but not
restricted to British nationals. Please contact Rus
Hoelzel for more information.

ErasmusMundus
EvolutionaryBiology
Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary
Biology (MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master pro-
gramme for talented and motivated European and non-
European students who are interested in understanding
evolution in all its facets. The MEME programme will
address the driving forces of evolution at all levels of
organismal organization (from cells and individuals to
populations and ecosystems), and it will allow students
to study all kinds of organisms (microorganisms, plants,
animals) in all kinds of habitats (marine as well as ter-January 1, 2012 EvolDir 19
restrial) with a diversity of approaches (ﬁeld, lab, the-
ory). The focus of the programme is not only on how
evolution shaped life on our planet in the past, but also
on how understanding the principles underlying evolu-
tion can provide new insights and help to cope with
present-day challenges in a variety of ﬁelds, including
ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunology, genet-
ics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and the social
sciences.
Only few universities in the world would be able to oﬀer
a programme of such broad scope without compromis-
ing scientiﬁc quality. For this reason, four European
universities ( University of Groningen (Netherlands);
University of Montpellier II (France); Ludwig Maximil-
ians University of Munich (Germany); Uppsala Univer-
sity (Sweden)), have joined forces with Harvard Univer-
sity (USA). Together, this consortium is able to put to-
gether an attractive multidisciplinary programme that
meets highest standards. All students have to study at
(at least) two partner universities, and they will receive
a double degree from two partner universities they have
attended.
Being ﬁnanced by the European Community, MEME
has to satisfy the high quality standards imposed the
prestigious Erasmus Mundus Programme. Full scholar-
ships are available for European and for non-European
students and these will be awarded in a selective pro-
cedure.
Starting date: September 2012
Application deadline: January 15, 2012 for European
and non-European students

PhylogenyInsectBehaviour
Fem-Italy.Phylogenomics&Behaviour
We are seeking an enthusiast student to employ ge-
nomics and phylogeny to understand the molecular ba-
sis of behavioural innovation in insects.
The student will focus on fruit ﬂies, in particular
Drosophila suzukii, an emerging fruit pest which shows
an unprecedented ecological behaviour when compared
to other fruit ﬂies. Other models will be grapevine spe-
ciﬁc insect parasites. The goal is to understand how
and when this species developed their novel ecological
behaviour. The student will employ bioinformatics (in-
cluding molecular phylogenetics, clock studies, compar-
ative genomics and transcriptomics) to study the evolu-
tionary history of the above species and of some of their
gene families. Depending on student attitude/interest
there may be space for other work spanning from chem-
ical ecology to evodevo, as well as for the development
of student’s own ideas.
Most of the training/work will be carried out at the
Research and Innovation Centre of the Edmund Mach
Foundation (FEM), an agricultural research institute
located in the Italian Alps. Part of the training will be
done at an external PhD school chosen by the candidate
in conjunction with FEM. Supervision will be given by20 EvolDir January 1, 2012
Omar Rota-Stabelli (phylogenomics) and Gianfranco
Anfora (chemical behaviour) as well as by one super-
visor at host university. FEM pays the studentship as
well as external fees. There will be plenty of inter-
action/training/collaboration with other labs both at
FEM and abroad, particularly at the Swedish Univer-
sity of Agricultural Sciences.
We are ideally looking for a candidate with a MSc in
biology, bioinformatics, agriculture or a related disci-
pline. A successful candidate will have a background
either in evolutionary biology or bioinformatics, with
some programming skills.

13 PhD studentships
INTERCROSSING oﬀers generously funded 3-year
training - available to candidates from all over the
world.
We are an EU funded ITN ( see http://-
cordis.europa.eu/fp7/mariecurieactions/itn en.html
)
We fund PhD studentships that will provide rigorous
training in three disciplines hardly ever found together
any one young scientist: population genetics, informat-ics and statistics. EU candidates are expected to apply
for training in a diﬀerent country.
The need for this supra-disciplinary combination of
skills reﬂects the extraordinary new demands pro-
duced by technologies that allow us to sequence whole
genomes, and to quantify their regulation and expres-
sion in many samples from the same species in multi-
ple locations. This torrent of data overwhelms current
computational, genetic and statistical approaches for
distinguishing the biologically relevant patterns from
the background noise.
The consortium behind INTERCROSSING - including
5 universities and 7 Small to Medium Enterprises span-
ning 9 EU countries - are all using the NGS technolo-
gies, but have found the recruitment of appropriate
Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) a major obstacle to
building on their innovations. This fundamental short-
age in the EU research community is slowing the scien-
tiﬁc and industrial exploitation of these groundbreak-
ing new data streams; the shortage of key talent oc-
curs worldwide. Students completing this training will
therefore be in high demand.

State University
Phylogenetics, Phylogeography, and Molecular Evolu-
tion
Applications for doctoral students in the lab of Dr.
Jeremy M. Brown at Louisiana State University (LSU)
are now being accepted for Fall 2012 admission. Re-
search in the Brown lab is broadly centered on the
use of a phylogenetic perspective to understand or-
ganismal history and molecular evolution. We work
on both methodological and empirical questions, often
taking a computational approach. Recent and ongo-
ing empirical work includes large-scale studies of ver-
tebrate phylogeny, the use of phylogenies as forensic
tools in criminal cases of HIV transmission, and inves-
tigations into somatic diversiﬁcation during tumor de-
velopment. Recent and ongoing methodological work
focuses on the development and testing of statisticalapproaches for phylogenomics and phylogeography. Ex-
tensive opportunities exist for collaboration with other
evolutionary genetics labs at LSU (including those of
Bryan Carstens, Mike Hellberg, Chris Austin, Dave
Foltz, Robb Brumﬁeld, and Prosanta Chakrabarty).
An interest in programming is encouraged, but no prior
background is required.
Accepted students are guaranteed funding through a
mixture of research and teaching assistantships. A
research assistantship (funded by the National Insti-
tute of Justice) to work on forensic HIV phylogenomics
is available for the 2012-13 school year. Some ex-
cellent fellowship opportunities are also available for
highly qualiﬁed applicants through the Louisiana Board
of Regents ( http://web.laregents.org/programs/borsf-
programs/graduate-fellows/ ).
LSU’s Dept. of Biological Sciences has a particu-
lar strength in computational evolutionary genetics.
LSU continues to invest heavily in the computational
sciences, with a recent focus on computational bi-
ology. Outstanding resources are available through
the Center for Computation and Technology ( http://-
www.cct.lsu.edu/home ) and the Louisiana Optical Net-
work Initiative ( http://www.loni.org/ ).
Baton Rouge is located in South Louisiana, one of the
most culturally unique locations in the United States
(http://louisianatravel.com/ ). The surrounding area
has excellent food, music, festivals, and outdoor recre-
ation. LSU’s campus is just over an hour’s drive from
New Orleans and allows easy access to much of the Gulf

Ecological and genomic research to optimise the con-
servation of dwarf birch in Scotland. Supervised by
Prof. Richard Nichols and Dr Richard Buggs (School
of Biological & Chemical Sciences, QMUL)
You will combine high-throughput genetic sequencing
with ecological ﬁeld- studies to evaluate conservation
threats to the rare Scottish montane species: Betula
nana (dwarf birch). Training in genetics and statis-
tics will be provided by biologists at QMUL; the CASE
partners, conservation charity Trees for Life and consul-
tancy group Highland Birchwoods, will provide train-
ing in ﬁeld biology and conservation management. This
study will provide a textbook example of how research
can enhance the practical conservation of a rare species.January 1, 2012 EvolDir 25
Dwarf birch is the subject of the studentship for three
reasons. (1) The research will solve critical problems
identiﬁed by Trees for Life and Highland Birchwoods
who are actively planting thousands of trees with a re-
cent grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. (2) Dwarf
birch is threatened by climate change, over-grazing
and hybridisation ˆ a solutions to these problems may
be extended to many other conservation projects. (3)
We already have genomic sequencing and genome-wide
marker development underway for this species.
You will assess whether dwarf birch populations show
evidence of loss of genetic diversity using RAD-
sequencing to genotype c. 5000 SNP markers in 10
individuals from 10 populations being considered as
seed sources for the conservation programme. You will
also scan SNP loci for signatures of selection using the
method developed by Beaumont and Nichols, combined
with analysis of morphological measurements to test
the hypothesis that the populations are locally adapted.
You will assess the threat from hybridization to dwarf
birch by using the genetic data, which can reveal genetic
introgression after many generations of back-crossing.
The project will involve at least 9 monthsˆ a ﬁeldwork
in Scotland, working closely with the CASE partners.
As well as collecting samples for sequencing, you will
survey many natural populations and new plantations
of dwarf birch, collecting data on abiotic environmental
factors, plant growth, and rare insect species associated
with dwarf birch. This data will be analysed to under-
stand the optimal growing conditions for dwarf birch
and current threats. Field assessments of how hybridi-
sation aﬀects the natural regeneration of dwarf birch
will complement the genetic analyses.
The funding for this studentship will cover College fees
and an annual stipend ( ˆA£15,590 in 2011/12) plus a
ˆA£1,000 pa supplement from the CASE partners. Ap-
plications are invited from candidates with, or expect-
ing to be awarded, at least an upper-second class hon-
ours degree in an area relevant to the project (e.g. Ecol-
ogy, Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Plant Sciences, Con-

PlantGenomeEvolution
Impact of polyploidy on plant genome evolution
Supervised by Professor Andrew R. Leitch (School
of Biological and Chemical Sciences, email:
a.r.leitch@qmul.ac.uk)
This proposal addresses the impact of polyploidy, or
whole genome multiplication for the generation of ge-
netic novelty. Polyploidy is a major driving force in the
generation of plant biodiversity, indeed 15% of specia-
tion events likely involve polyploidy and probably all
plant species have polyploidy in their ancestry.
The project will combine cytogenetics, epigenetics and
next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to de-
termine how polyploidy inﬂuences genome evolution.
It takes advantage of a series of natural and synthetic
polyploids in genus Nicotiana that we have elevated into
key model systems. (cf. Leitch & Leitch 2008, Science
320, 481-483). The proposed project will reveal pat-
terns and tempo of polyploid genome divergence and
determine how epigenetic modiﬁcations modulate or
control genetic change. The research output will be a
wealth of genomic features of interest to those studying
genome evolution, speciation and crop genetics. It will
also shed light on the role epigenetics plays at diﬀerent
stages of polyploidy evolution, a hitherto unexplored
area of research.
To reach our objectives, you will combine standard and
cutting edge cytogenetics, molecular biology and in-
novative NGS (Illumina platform technology) to: [1]
Track down and identify key DNA sequences involved in
polyploid species evolution. [2] Determine the genomic
organisation of the sequences. [3] Evaluate the extent
of epigenetic repatterning with polyploidy. [4] Deter-
mine modes and tempo of polyploid-induced sequence
divergence. [5] Uncover the key processes associated
with polyploid species divergence.
You will receive training in: Bioinformatics - to anal-26 EvolDir January 1, 2012

NGS; experimental design V to conduct and design
novel experimental approaches to determine the key
sequence players in polyploid species evolution; Lab-

sation and molecular biology procedures (e.g. PCR,
qPCR, PFGE) to characterise key repeats involved

QueensU Belfast Nutrition Fitness
DEL funded PhD position at Queen’s University
Belfast
You are what you eat: the nutritional ecology of repro-
duction and ageing
Supervisors: Dr Sheena Cotter, Prof. Jaimie Dick
(Queen’s University Belfast)
Dr Rebecca Kilner (University of Cambridge), Prof.
Ken Wilson (Lancaster University)
Disparate organisms, from humans to slime moulds, can
balance their intake of diﬀerent nutrients to maximize
ﬁtness. However, it is unknown whether this balance
changes as organisms age and it is unclear whether or-
ganisms can oﬀset the costs of reproduction through
selective resource intake. We propose to use the bury-
ing beetle as a model system for addressing these gen-
eral issues. Burying beetles are ideal for such work be-
cause we already know that reproductive investment is
modiﬁed with age (Cotter et al 2011) and that burying
beetles experience ﬁtness costs associated with repro-
duction (Ward et al 2009, Cotter et al 2010). This
project will investigate the costs of reproduction and
ageing in a nutritional context and determine whether
individuals can modify their diet to balance the needs
of reproduction and self-maintenance.
The aim of this PhD studentship is to understand how
resources are partitioned between diﬀerent traits thatcontribute to ﬁtness. The student will use the ge-
ometric framework for nutritional analyses (Simpson
& Raubenheimer 1995) to assess which nutrient in-
takes maximize ﬁtness at diﬀerent ages and reproduc-
tive stages. Dietary manipulations will be then be used
to probe the costs of reproduction, and choice tests em-
ployed to test whether individuals can ameliorate costs
through selective nutrient intake.
Training
The student will receive training in:
* Insect rearing, collection and pedigrees * Dietary ma-
nipulations * Immunity assays * Statistical analysis

TuftsU SpeciationBiology
Graduate Position: Speciation Biology at Tufts
The Dopman Lab at Tufts University is seeking a doc-
toral student for Fall 2012 with an interest in specia-
tion biology. The long-range goal of our research pro-
gram is to gain a better understanding of how genes
evolve to restrict gene ﬂow within the context of ac-
cumulating isolating barriers that ultimately produce
new species. As most life on earth arises following the
combined action of multiple isolating barriers, some our
deepest insights will come by genetically dissecting bar-
riers that are widespread across taxa and eliminate dis-
proportionate amounts of gene ﬂow between daughter
lineages. Emerging research reveals that ecological and
behavioral barriers satisfy both criteria.
The Ostrinia genus is well suited to studying speciation
because we have information on genetics, ecology, and
sexual communication for numerous species. One of
the better known Ostrinia is the European Corn Borer
(ECB) moth. The ECB is a commonly cited model
for speciation biology because sympatric “strains” are
at the early stages of divergence and therefore provide
a window into the evolutionary process of speciation.
Of 12 potential isolating barriers between ECB strains,
seven signiﬁcantly reduce gene ﬂow and ﬁve are either
behavioral or ecological in nature. Current eﬀorts in
our lab are dedicated to elucidating the genetic basis
for phenotypes underlying relevant ecological and be-havioral barriers between strains, and determining the
consequences of this variation for gene ﬂow.
We seek a creative and motivated graduate student to
work on speciation using the ECB as a model, but the
potential for developing new research directions is high.
Students must have the ability to work with others and
a sense of humor, both of which are needed to make
science fun and worthwhile. A strong undergraduate
background in evolutionary biology is required, as is
prior research experience. Relevant and highly desir-
able experience includes application of molecular ge-
netic techniques or computational analysis of gene or
genome/transcriptome data.
The Dopman Lab is in the Department of Biology and
is a member of Tufts’ Collaborative Cluster in Genome
Structure and Developmental Patterning. The Clus-
ter focuses on genome to organism research and is lo-
cated at a new Tufts facility on the main campus in
Medford, MA. With two additional Tufts campuses (in
Boston and Grafton), other research universities (Har-
vard, MIT, BU), and the vibrant city of Boston all
within reach, Medford and Tufts are ideal places to live
and work. ( http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/ ).

letter that includes a statement of research interests,
relevant educational background, and prior research

UAntwerp BehaviouralEvolution
The Evolutionary Ecology Group at the University of
Antwerp has a vacancy for TWO PHD STUDENT PO-
SITIONS in the following project: The role of explo-
ration and experience in the development of spatial be-
haviour: home ranges and dispersal in the Great Tit
Starting date: 1st March 2012 Application deadline:
3rd January 2012
Project description28 EvolDir January 1, 2012
This project is part of a larger research program on pat-
terns and processes of mobility and dispersal in animal
populations. It is also closely linked to our long-term
studies on ecology and behaviour of great and blue tits
in nest-box populations. The general aim of this project
is to test two general hypotheses on spatial behaviour,
using a combination of ﬁeld data, behavioural experi-
ments and quantitative genetics: (a) individuals build
up spatial information in the course of their life which
they use in subsequent movement decisions, and this
creates carry-over eﬀects between life stages; (b) indi-
viduals diﬀer consistently in their use of spatial infor-
mation, and this explains part of the within-population
variation in mobility patterns.
Brieﬂy, we will collect detailed information on disper-
sal, exploration movements and home-ranges of two full
cohorts of great tits throughout their lifetime. This in-
formation will be linked to a number of behavioural
tests on exploration behaviour in laboratory and semi-
natural contexts, and to results of experiments manip-
ulating spatial behaviour. The project has funding for
two PhD students who will work closely together, but
for their dissertation each will focus on diﬀerent parts
of the project.
The ﬁrst PhD project will focus on individual variation
in behaviour. The student’s main task will be to design
and perform experiments in lab and ﬁeld to study explo-
ration behaviour in diﬀerent contexts, and relate this to
lifetime spatial behaviour of the same birds. In addition
the student will devise experimental ﬁeld procedures
aimed at manipulating spatial experience of birds.
The second PhD project will focus on the analysis of
lifetime patterns of mobility, with particular attention
to the roles of heritable variation and prior experi-
ence. The statistical analysis will involve both linear
and discrete-choice models. This part of the thesis will
be partly co-supervised by Peter Goos of the Statistics
Core Facility. The student will also analyze pedigree
data with Animal models to obtain quantitative genetic
estimates of heritable variation in traits associated with
spatial behaviours. Both students will participate in
collecting ﬁeld data on mobility as well as routine pop-
ulation data.
Requirements
We are looking for enthusiastic and broad-minded can-
didates with a Master degree in Biology, a specialization
in behavioural ecology or evolutionary ecology, excel-
lent study grades, and a particular interest in study-
ing processes that shape animal movement patterns.
For the ﬁrst position we prefer a student with a par-
ticular interest in experimental approaches for testing
behavioural hypotheses, both in the lab and the ﬁeld.Aﬃnity with studying birds, in captivity as well as in
the ﬁeld, is an advantage for both positions. For the sec-
ond position, preference goes to a candidate with strong
statistical skills and an interest in modelling complex
data. An additional degree in statistics is a particular
advantage.
What we have to oﬀer:
- We oﬀer a PhD-scholarship for a maximum of four
years (with a net salary of ca 1800 euro/month) with
the aim of defending a PhD-dissertation at the end of
the fourth year. After one year, the performance of
the candidates will be evaluated to decide whether the
scholarship will be continued.
- You will enrol in the Antwerp Doctoral School training
program ( www.ua.ac.be/ads ) allowing you to take part
in various courses, training programs and conferences
within and outside the University.
- You will work in a team of several PhD students, post-
docs and technical staﬀ involved in the long-term great
and blue tit study
- You will be member of the Evolutionary Ecology
group, a dynamic and internationally-oriented research
group that combines ﬁeld, lab and modelling ap-
proaches to study various questions in ecology and evo-
lutionary research, mainly focusing on birds and mam-
mals ( www.ua.ac.be/eveco ).

UBern InvasionPopulationGenetics
PhD position inJanuary 1, 2012 EvolDir 29
Molecular and organismic invasion ecology
We are looking for a PhD candidate merging population
genetics and organismic ecology to gain a more mecha-
nistic and evolutionary understanding of invasion ecol-
ogy. The project focuses on Arion lusitanicus (Spanish
slug) which is regarded as one of the hundred most in-
vasive alien species in Europe, and a serious pest in
agriculture and gardening. Genetic and ecological ap-
proaches will be combined for investigating the history
and mechanisms of the ongoing invasion. The project
aims at the identiﬁcation of invasion and colonization
routes of the slug, and at assessing the ecological and
evolutionary consequences of the invasion for the native
relatives and related ecosystem processes. The project
will combine molecular marker development using high-
throughput sequencing, DNA sequencing, microsatel-
lite genotyping, as well as experimental approaches in-
cluding laboratory breeding, competition and ﬁeld ex-
periments.
We are seeking a highly motivated, independent PhD
candidate who is willing to perform ﬁeldwork, molec-
ular laboratory work, and state-of-the-art statistical
modelling of genetic and ecological data. The ideal can-
didate has a strong background in ecology and evolu-
tionary biology, especially population genetics and phy-
logeography, and experience with molecular laboratory
work and ﬁeldwork. Experience with bioinformatics is
a plus but not essential. A degree equivalent to a bi-
ology diploma or M.Sc. and a valid driver’s license is
required. Good written and spoken English is expected.
Some knowledge of German or French would be bene-
ﬁcial for living in Switzerland but it is not necessary.
The working language in our institute is English.
You will be supervised by Gerald Heckel (population
genetics) and Eva Knop (community ecology). We of-
fer a stimulating research environment with excellent
facilities for laboratory work, computational analyses
and ecological experiments. Information on the insti-
tute, the University of Bern, or life here in general can

phdbielefeld2011d.pdf] 1 PhD Position in population
genetics and demographic analysis of newt populations
Due to their limited dispersal ability amphibians are
generally considered to be structured as metapopula-
tions. However, new studies show that the dispersal
propensity of amphibians has been vastly underesti-
mated in the past, thus challenging this common view.
Aimed as a case study on a typically pond-breeding am-
phibian species this research project analyses the pop-
ulation structure of crested newts (Triturus cristatus)
in the north of Germany (Hamburg). By applying new
and powerful molecular approaches to determine the
spatial extent of crested newt populations without any
a priori assumption on the level of three spatial scales
this project will explore the real spatial extent of crested
newt populations by overcoming potential biases of past
approaches. The chosen study design will allow to iden-
tify the degree of population connectivity and gene ﬂow
between breeding sites of crested newts and to com-
bine these genetic data with demographic parameters
estimated from mark-recapture data (birth, death, im-
migration and emigration) of breeding sites on a local
scale. The results of the study will provide new and
deep insights into the population dynamics of a typi-
cally pond-breeding amphibian species in evolutionary
and ecological terms without confounding past a priori30 EvolDir January 1, 2012
assumptions on the structure of amphibian populations.
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate
who is willing to perform intensive ﬁeld work (collection
of genetic and mark-recapture data), molecular labora-
tory work and state-of-the-art statistical modelling of
genetic and mark-recapture data. Field work will be
performed near Hamburg, molecular laboratory work
and analyses will be carried out in the group of Sebas-
tian Steinfartz at the University of Bielefeld and anal-
ysis of demographic data will be done at the Univer-
sity of Zurich in cooperation with Benedikt Schmidt.
While based in Hamburg a close cooperation with the
groups of J¨ org Ganzhorn (Department of Ecology) and
Alexander Haas (section of Herpetology) at the Zoolog-
ical Institute of the University of Hamburg is intended.
We are searching for a candidate who is highly ﬂexi-
ble and willing to challenge the successful integration
of molecular and ﬁrst hand collected ﬁeld and ecologi-
cal data on a high level. In order to achieve this goal
the successful candidate will be based at the three dif-
ferent locations (i.e. in Bielefeld, Hamburg and Zurich)
with excellent research conditions and groups of highly
motivated people with a strong interest and research
background in organismic ecology and evolution. The
position (65% TV-L E13) will start at the beginning of
February 2012 and is funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG) for three years.

Divergence in life history along ecological gradients
in Australian rainforest Drosophilia: how does early
growth aﬀect longevity and immunity?
Supervisors: Dr Jon Bridle (University of Bristol) and
Dr Nick Priest (University of Bath)
Evolution is a multiple optimisation problem: selection
to optimise one trait typically has negative eﬀects on
others. Classical trade-oﬀs include egg size and number,
development rate and competitiveness, and fecundity
and longevity but we lack empirical data on how con-
sistent these correlations are across populations of the
same species. Quantifying correlations between ﬁtness
traits, especially where they act diﬀerently on diﬀerent
life stages or genders, is critical to understand longevity
and health in natural populations.
This studentship will explore how insect life histories
are shaped by local selection. We are currently test-
ing adaptive divergence in Australian Drosophila birchii
along four 2-10 km ecological gradients, and are mea-
suring 400+ isofemale lines from diﬀerent altitudes for
stress resistance, female fecundity and male mating suc-
cess. These lines show remarkable increases in labora-
tory productivity at higher altitudes, implying strong
trade-oﬀs in the ﬁeld. The student will examine how
these traits aﬀect the rate of ageing and the ability
to resist fungal infections. Previous analyses of such
Drosophila traits have revealed consistent associations
between immunity, behaviour, longevity, and tempera-
ture.
We are looking for a highly-motivated student with a
passion for evolutionary biology and genetics. (S)he
will receive training in life history evolution theory,
quantitative genetics, and modern molecular tech-
niques, and will measure genetic variation in life history
traits in Drosophila, and (most crucially) how these cor-
relations vary among sites. In addition, (s)he will as-
say genome-wide linkage disequilibria in SNPs, allowing
exploration of the genomic basis for these trait correla-
tions.January 1, 2012 EvolDir 31

UCapeTown PlumagePolymorphism
Plumage polymorphism, with diﬀerent plumage morphs
occurring in the same age and sex classes of a breeding
population, occurs in around 3.5% of bird species and
has fascinated evolutionary ecologists for many years.
Polymorphism is common in raptors, with around 30%
of species expressing more than one colour morph. The
Black Sparrowhawk (Accipiter melanoleucus) is a poly-
morphic raptor that exhibits a common light morph
and a rarer dark morph. This species has recently
colonised the Cape Peninsula in the Western Cape of
South Africa where we have monitored the population
for over 10 years. In this population the frequencies of
the morphs are reversed with around 80% being dark
morph birds.
Throughout most of its traditional range in southern
Africa the Black Sparrowhawk breeds in the dry win-
ter months, however in the Western Cape the species
breeds during the wet winter months. This PhD will
test the hypothesis that there is a selective advantage
to being dark in these conditions.
The project will seek to understand the origin, adap-
tive function and maintenance of plumage colour vari-
ation in this species through two key components: an
ecological study, which will test whether the diﬀerent
morphs have a selective advantage in diﬀerent habitats
or under diﬀerent climatic conditions, and a molecular
study to i) establish the role of the melanocortin-1 re-
ceptor (MC1R) in the evolution of plumage morphs in
Black Sparrowhawks, and ii) to test the alternative hy-
pothesis that plumage polymorphisms are maintained
through limited dispersal and genetic drift.
The successful applicant will have an MSc degree in Zo-
ology (or equivalent), relevant ornithological ﬁeld expe-
rience and be available to start in early 2012. Studentswith a good BSc Honours degree and experience may
be considered for registration at MSc level, with the
intention to upgrade to PhD level. Funding is secured

UCincinnati EvolutionaryGenomics
The Baucom lab at the University of Cincinnati is cur-
rently recruiting PhD students interested in Plant Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Genomics.
Current projects in the lab are focused on the genetic
basis of trade-oﬀs in plant defense, the evolution of
plant ’weediness’ and invasiveness, the impact of the
mating system and gene ﬂow on the evolution of her-
bicide resistance, and the inﬂuence of the soil metage-
nomic community on the evolution of important plant
traits. We focus on the model weed species *Ipomoea
purpurea* (the common morning glory) for the major-
ity of these questions, although the potential to work
with other plant species exists. We utilize manipulative
ﬁeld and greenhouse experiments, coupled with various
molecular and genomics techniques, such as RNA-seq
and transcriptome analysis. Students who train in the
Baucom lab will learn how to utilize and manipulate
large genomic datasets and thus basic bioinformatics
techniques.
The Department of Biological Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati hosts a strong group of evolutionary
ecologists and biologists that are organized into Envi-
ronmental Change and Biological Resilience (ECBR)
and Sensory Biology, Behavior and Evolution (SBBE).32 EvolDir January 1, 2012
The training environment thus has an emphasis on evo-
lution, ecology, genetics and behavior. Cincinnati, or

UEdinburgh VirulenceEvolution
Funded PhD position available (full funding only
for UK residents), evolution of bacterial virulence.
(for application details see http://www.ﬁndaphd.com/-
search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=36260&LID=455 )
Bacterial pathogens are overwhelmingly opportunistic
and typically grow in distinct environments causing no
harm to humans. The major challenge in this pro-
posal is to build new theory for virulence evolution in
opportunistic pathogens, with a focus on food-borne
pathogens, in particular pathogenic strains of E. coli.
The evolution of virulence is a major focus in evo-
lutionary biology, and has resulted in a large body
of theory based on the assumption that virulence is
a result of selection for virulence factors (VFs) that
enhance within-host growth, survival or between-host
transmission. While this theory has met with suc-
cess for specialist pathogens (e.g. malaria), for many
opportunistic pathogens these proposed countervailing
growth/transmission beneﬁts of VF expression are dif-
ﬁcult to identify in hosts, casting a large body of theory
into doubt. To answer this challenge, we will develop
and test a novel theoretical framework for virulencedynamics across multiple environments (from farm to
fork). This project promises to deliver a signiﬁcant redi-
rection of virulence evolution theory, to capture the en-
vironmental and regulatory complexity of virulence in
bacterial opportunistic pathogens.
In addition to a core theoretical component, experimen-
tal investigations will also be encouraged, to foster an
integrative training spanning molecular microbiology,
systems biology, ecology and evolution.

UGlasgow EvolutionaryPhysiology
*PhD studentship U Glasgow: Physiology of annual cy-
cles / moult / climate change (UK residents)*
A textbook example in evolutionary biology involves
changing frequencies of colour morphs, e.g. of light
and dark Peppered moths, due to selection. For some
long-lived species, corresponding need for phenotypic
colour-adjustment recurs periodically, for example to
match the white of snow cover in winter. Because such
changes must be ﬁnely coordinated with environmental
seasonality animals may be vulnerable to currently ob-
served rapid changes in phenology. At present, our un-
derstanding of the physiological mechanisms that reg-
ulate periodic processes is insuﬃcient for predicting to
which extent animals can adapt to changing seasonal-
ity. To address this deﬁcit, we use interdisciplinary ap-January 1, 2012 EvolDir 33

“Tracking the seasons: tissue-based memory for avian
moult?”
Supervisory Team: Barbara Helm, Neil P. Evans,
Michelle Bellingham,
Jane E. Robinson, Peter J. Sharp, and Gerald A. Lin-
coln
One of today’s major scientiﬁc challenges is to under-
stand the eﬀects of global climate change on ecosys-
tem health. For most wild organisms mismatches be-
tween seasonally timed activities and environmental
conditions can result in ﬁtness costs to the individ-
ual as well as the whole population. For example, in
species that exhibit geographically ﬁne-tuned seasonal
colour dimorphism (eg Ptarmigan), changing weather
patterns could lead to temporal colour mismatching
that heighten predation risk. In response to changes in
ambient temperature some species have adjusted their
seasonal migration or breeding distribution and are now
exposed to photoperiods that diﬀer from those to which
they had formerly adapted. We thus need a greater
understanding and ability to predict the costs and con-
sequences of climate change. Birds provide an ideal
model to address this as their seasonal activities in the
wild are relatively well-known. Avian moult is an easily
measurable trait that aﬀects locomotor performance,
thermoregulation, ornamentation and camouﬂage, all
of which are linked to ﬁtness. Therefore, it can be used
to study scheduling in evolutionary and ecological con-
texts, as well as for investigating regenerative, cycli-
cal processes and how these can be aﬀected by climate
change. This PhD project will address mechanisms of
annual timing, speciﬁcally of avian moult, from a phys-
iological perspective, with the aim of establishing links
to seasonal processes in free-living birds. Funding: The
project is NERC-funded for a duration of 3 years (UK
residents only; £13,590 pa + full fees).
Eligibility and application: Interested candidates must

ParasiteResistanceEvolution
PhD Studentship: University of Glasgow
Applied evolution: an experimental approach to inves-
tigating how the interaction between parasite life his-
tory strategies and control measures aﬀects rates of re-
sistance evolution
Supervisory Team: Barbara Mable, Jan Lindstr¨ om (In-
stitute of Biodiversity, Animal Health & Comparative
Medicine), Paul Johnson (Robertson Centre for Bio-
statistics)
Resistance management is a key concern in human and
veterinary medicine and in agricultural production sys-
tems. Although theoretical population genetics models
predict factors that might inﬂuence resistance evolution
in pathogens, potential interactions among pathogen
attributes (e.g. mating system, life history traits, rate
of gene ﬂow between resistant and susceptible geno-
types) and speciﬁc control measures (e.g., frequency
and dosage of chemical applications) remain unclear.
This study will take an experimental evolution ap-
proach to understanding the inﬂuence of such interac-
tions on rates of resistance evolution, using nematodes
as a model. Due to the diﬃculty of manipulating par-
asites in wild hosts, resistance evolution previously has
been studied in the free-living but hermaphroditic and
selﬁng nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. However,
since most parasitic nematodes are outcrossing, this
study will use Caenorhabditis remanei, whose mating
system is more similar to that of most parasitic nema-34 EvolDir January 1, 2012
todes. The rate of evolution of resistance will be evalu-
ated by treating worms with anthelminthics, applied at
diﬀerent frequencies and dosages, under experimentally
varied reproductive modes and population demograph-
ics. The project is interdisciplinary and the student will
receive training in a wide range of approaches, including
experimental design, statistical analyses, experimental
evolution, life history and population genetics theory,
resistance management strategies, host- pathogen in-
teractions, basic molecular and genomic techniques, ge-
netic manipulation through transformation, and micro-
biology.
There is much potential for the student to develop spe-
ciﬁc strategies and possibly to extend the scope of the
project to consider rates of evolution of other traits
(e.g., longevity) or to investigate the genetic basis of re-
sistance evolution. However, initial focus will be on the
following questions: 1) Does manipulation of the mat-
ing system (outcrossing vs inbreeding; single vs polyga-
mous mating) of C. remanei aﬀect the rate of resistance
evolution to anthelminthics? 2) Do particular life his-
tory strategies (reproduction early or late) aﬀect the
rate of resistance evolution? 3) How does anthelminthic
dosage or frequency of application aﬀect the rate of re-
sistance evolution? 4) How does gene ﬂow between sus-
ceptible and resistant worms aﬀect the rate of resistance
evolution? 5) Is there an interaction between dosage,
mating system and life history traits?

The School of Integrative Biology at the University
of Illinois is recruiting PhD students through a newly
funded IGERT training grant, Vertically Integrated
Training With Genomics (VInTG). VInTG students
will address two grand challenges in biology: 1. How
do genomes interact with the environment to produce
biological diversity? 2. How are biological systems in-
tegrated from molecules to ecosystems? Our training
model uses a back to the future approach where stu-
dents will integrate modern, genome-enabled biology
with a traditional, taxon-based approach.
The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI),
one of the world’s premier tropical research institutes,
is a partner in the grant and all students will be co-
advised by both STRI and Illinois faculty. In addi-
tion, VInTG students will have access to STRI’s di-
verse study sites and databanks for a wide variety of
organisms and ecosystems in Panama.
To be eligible for support from this training grant, stu-
dents must ﬁrst be accepted into a graduate program
at the University of Illinois. Examples of participating
graduate programs include (but are not limited to) the
Department of Animal Biology, Department of Ento-
mology, Department of Plant Biology, Department of
Natural Resources and Environmental Science, and the
Program in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biol-
ogy.

UJyvaskyla EvolutionBehaviour
PhD-student position: evolution of social control mech-
anisms.
Center of Excellence in Biological Interactions, Univer-
sity of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, University of Helsinki (Finland).Cooperation among individuals is a ubiquitous phe-
nomenon across taxa from microbes to humans. How-
ever, the stability of cooperative relationships presents
an evolutionary problem because cheaters who reap the
beneﬁts of cooperation without contributing to its costs
can destabilize the cooperative relationships. Several
mechanisms that control cheating behavior and main-
tain cooperation have been described in diﬀerent taxa.
These include punishment in cooperatively breeding
birds, worker policing in insect societies, and partner
choice in legume-rhizobia mutualisms. However, the
links between biological reality and theoretical models
of social control evolution are poorly understood, as
are the consequences of diﬀerent social control mech-
anisms at the level of groups and populations. This
project aims at comparing and synthesizing the diﬀer-
ent approaches and examining their evolutionary con-
sequences through a combination of theoretical and
empirical work. The successful candidate can engage
with the following topics, but is also welcome to de-
velop other research related to the topic of social control
mechanisms:
1. Mechanisms of social control across taxa and evolu-
tionary contexts: reviewing and synthesizing theoreti-
cal models.
2. Social control in human co-operation: empirical
studies on the eﬀectiveness and consequences of diﬀer-
ent social control mechanisms (e.g. punishment and
exclusion) on group success.
3. Population consequences of social control: simu-
lation studies on the eﬀects of diﬀerent social control
mechanisms on the long term prospects of populations.
The appointed candidate will be a member of the newly
appointed Finnish Centre of Excellence in Biological
Interactions funded by the Academy of Finland. We
oﬀer a stimulating, creative and international working
environment, modern facilities, reliable funding body,
excellent career prospects and nice colleagues.
The successful candidate will defend his/her thesis at
the University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Finland. The thesis su-
pervisors are Dr. Mikael Puurtinen at the Univer-
sity of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a and Dr. Heikki Helanter¨ a at the
University of Helsinki. The empirical studies on hu-
man co-operation will be carried out at the University
of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a using computer-mediated decision mak-
ing experiments. Theoretical work will be jointly su-
pervised by Dr. Mikael Puurtinen and Dr. Heikki

ImprintingBioinformatician
PhD scholarship for a Bioinformatician for a project on
the evolution of genomic imprinting in social bees
Title of project: Social bees as a model for testing evo-
lutionary theories of genomic imprinting
Outline of project: In mammals and ﬂowering plants,
some genes are known to be expressed to a diﬀerent
extent depending on whether they are inherited from
the mother or from the father. Mechanistically, it is
thought that such “genomic imprinting” is based on
diﬀerential DNA methylation or histone modiﬁcations
in the parental germ lines. Evolutionarily speaking,40 EvolDir January 1, 2012
however, the functional signiﬁcance of imprinting re-
mains highly controversial. One of the theories, known
as David Haig’s kin conﬂict theory of genomic imprint-
ing, posits that parent-of-origin speciﬁc gene expression
patterns are a reﬂection of the diﬀering evolutionary
interests of maternally and paternally inherited genes.
In this project, we will use the honeybee and the bum-
blebee as two novel insect models to study the occur-
rence of genomic imprinting and test Haig’s theory.
In our study, imprinted genes will be searched for us-
ing cutting-edge high-throughput sequencing methods,
which now allow genome-wide screens for diﬀerentially
methylated and imprinted genes against a reasonable
cost.
The main task for the PhD student will be to carry
out bio-informatic analyses on these nextgen sequenc-
ing data (alignment to reference genome, identiﬁca-
tion of parent-speciﬁc SNPs, matching RNA sequencing
data to identiﬁed SNPs). Prior experience in analysing
nextgen sequencing data is a must. Experience with
BioPerl, R/Bioconductor and Python is also desirable.
The ideal candidate would have a master in Bio infor-
matics.
Earliest possible starting date: March 1 2012, or until
position is ﬁlled. Application deadline: January 31st
2012
Funding is available for 4 years, and matching fund-
ing for consumable costs (ca. 25 000 euro/year) is also
available.
The project will be supervised by Prof. Tom Wense-
leers from the University of Leuven. For more infor-
mation on his group, see http://bio.kuleuven.be/ento/-

UOtago EvolutionSocialNetworks
Applications are being sought for the following PhD
project at the Department of Zoology, University of
Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.
Theme: Animal personality and social networks in
a species with variable mating systems, the dunnock
(Prunella modularis).
Supervisor: Dr. Shinichi Nakagawa
(shinichi.nakagawa@otago.ac.nz)
Project Description: So-called animal personality (i.e.
individual consistency within behaviours and correla-
tions among behaviors) has become a major area of
research in Behavioural Ecology. However, the under-
standing of individual consistency and variation in be-
haviour within populations is still far from complete.
Although statistical approaches termed social network
analyses have been extensively used for human person-January 1, 2012 EvolDir 41
ality research, the application of this technique to ani-
mal personality research is still limited.
By employing social network analysis, we plan to in-
vestigate one of the most diverse and complex mating
systems observed to date in the animal kingdom - i.e.
those of Dunnocks (see the brilliant book by the fa-
ther of Behavioural Ecology, Prof. Nick Davies - Dun-
nock Behaviour and Social Evolution. Oxford Press,
1992). Our group has established a study population of
Dunnocks in the Dunedin Botanic Garden where most
of the individuals are uniquely marked and have been
monitored for a period of 3 years. Dunnocks were ﬁrst
introduced in New Zealand around 150 years ago and
probably took an original evolutionary path compared
to their source populations in the UK. We have discov-
ered that many life-history aspects are diﬀerent in this
population in relation to the well-studied population
from Cambridge (e.g., mating patterns and longevity).
Combining extensive ﬁeld data, sophisticated statistical
techniques and computer simulations, this study tries
to understand the maintenance of consistent individuals
variation in behaviours, especially mating and parental
care behaviours. This PhD programme is demanding
but comprehensive in a way that students are exposed
to: 1) a variety of ﬁeld skills, 2) diverse statistical skills,
3) basic molecular techniques, and 4) computer simula-
tions using agent-based modeling. Students are encour-
aged to form their own questions within the framework
of the research programme (visit our website: http://-
sparrow.otago.ac.nz/ ). I expect that the candidate will
come out of this PhD as a well-rounded scientist with
a multitude of skills.
The Ideal Candidate: The ideal candidate will pos-
sess experience in ﬁeld ornithology, behavioural ecol-
ogy and molecular ecology. They will be motivated,
organised and extremely hardworking, with a demon-
strated capacity to master the broad skill set necessary
for the successful completion of a research programme.
They will be a competent ﬁeld worker, with experience
of mist netting, and should be computer literate with
familiarity with database management and statistical
analyses (computer programming experience is plus but
not required). Minimum qualiﬁcations: B.Sc. (Hons)
and/or M.Sc. in Biological Sciences or equivalent with
and A- average or better (note that adjustments are
applied to other grade systems around the world; see
below).
Scholarship Funding: Financial support should be
available for a high achieving student with an A- av-
erage or better via a University of Otago scholar-
ship (see http://www.otago.ac.nz/study/scholarships/-
). The scholarship provides NZ$ 25,000 stipend per yearfor a total of 3 years, and also covers tuition fees.
Eligibility: The University of Otago and Departmental
scholarships are open to all nationalities. However,
overseas candidates for whom English is not a ﬁrst
language must satisfy the English Language Require-
ments of the University to be eligible for study (see

criteria are detailed here http://www.otago.ac.nz/-
international/postgraduate/otago002221.html . How
to Apply: Interested applicants are encouraged to
make informal enquiries to Dr Shinichi Nakagawa.
Please send your Curriculum Vitae, a copy of your
academic transcript, a sample of your written scientiﬁc
work and the names of two referees with a cover letter

USeﬃeld FireAdaptation
PhD funding opportunity for research on: Response of
C3 and C4 grasses to ﬁre and herbivory
R95 000 yr-1 for 3 years.
A collaborative project between Rhodes University, and
the Universities of Sheﬃeld and Cambridge.
The future climate of southern Africa is likely to in-
clude an increased intensity of the monsoonal system
accompanied by greater ﬁre frequency. Fire in grassy
ecosystems is not selective and species that are tol-
erant of burning increase in abundance. Recent re-
search has demonstrated that C4 grasses are more tol-
erant of burning than closely related C3 species. The
C4 species recover faster after ﬁre and have traits in-
cluding higher winter fuel loads and ﬂammability that
are likely to promote seasonal burning. In addition
to these direct eﬀects on grass performance, re-growth
after ﬁre increases leaf palatability, which compounds
potential palatability diﬀerences between C3 and C4
species. Hence, an understanding of the interaction of
ﬁre and herbivory is essential to understanding the fu-
ture community structure of grassy ecosystems.
This study proposes to investigate this interaction by
comparing the response of a model species (Alloterop-
sis semialata) to ﬁre and selective herbivory using a
common garden plot experiment. Replicate plots co-
planted with the C3 and C4 subspecies of A. semialata
have been established at Rhodes University (Graham-
stown, South Africa) and will be subject to ﬁre and
selective herbivory in a factorial design. The relative
performance of C3 and C4 plants will be assessed us-ing established techniques. Results are anticipated to
make a signiﬁcant contribution to our mechanistic un-
derstanding how C3 and C4 grasses respond diﬀeren-
tially to ﬁre.
Applicants interested should have graduated with

Applications are being accepted for the following PhD
project at the University of Sheﬃeld, Department of
Animal and Plant Sciences, UK.
The molecular ecology of stress: developmental plas-
ticity in the face of predators, pathogens and climate
change. Supervisor: Dr. Andrew Beckerman ( http://-
www.beckslab.staﬀ.shef.ac.uk/ )
Developmental plasticity deﬁnes the capacity of organ-
isms to respond to environmental change -“ natural
changes such as disease and predation, and human in-
duced change in climate. This project will focus on
three forms of stress linked to environmental change:
increased temperature, exposure to parasites and ex-
posure to predation. These forms of stress represent
the major axes of natural and human induced threat
for most organisms.
The project will focus on how chitin, central to devel-
opment and disease, mediates adaptation in a changing
environment. The student will link sensory perception
genes and neurotransmitters - responsible for signal de-
tection and initiating cascades of development -” with
special nuclear receptor genes that oversee and coor-January 1, 2012 EvolDir 43
dinate patterns of development and importantly chitin
synthesis and degradation. The project will identify de-
velopmental mechanisms for coping with environmen-
tal change, using the model system of Daphnia magna
and will leverage several advanced technologies includ-
ing RT-qPCR and transcriptomics.
The following three objectives frame the project: 1)
Evaluate the role of candidate sensory and regulatory
genes in stress responses via rigourous experiments and
RT-qPCR. 2) Leverage extensive natural genetic varia-
tion and experimental transcriptomic technology to re-
veal major sets of genes responsible for detection, de-
velopment and regulation of stress responses under cli-
mate change. 3) Explore via network modelling, can-
didate regulatory networks mediating stress responses
common to and unique to each form of stress.
The PhD will take advantage of collaborations between
Sheﬃeld, Edinburgh and the Daphnia Genomics Con-
sortium (Indiana, USA)
Candidates must apply by Jan 20 2012. I will interview
a shortlist by the end of January, in preparation for
a mandatory departmental interview in Mid-February.
Successful candidates will be funded by NERC- UK or

Two MS Fellowships: Utah State University Wildland
Resources Department Environment and Society De-
partment
The College of Natural Resources at Utah State Uni-
versity invites applications for two MS Fellowships to
begin Fall 2012
Natural resource professionals face ecological changes
occurring at unprecedented scales and rates due to a
combination of historical management activities and
climate change. In the Interior West, many forest
ecosystems are at, or near, tipping points with re-
spect to ecological integrity. Phenomena such as large-
scale insect outbreaks, rapid aspen die-oﬀs, and ge-
ographically and temporally synchronized severe ﬁres
are occurring across the region. Impacts may exceed
historical resilience limits of forests, resulting in irre-
versible ecosystem state changes with pronounced so-
cioeconomic impacts. This situation creates an acute
need for a new generation of forest resource managers
and scientists skilled in a variety of emerging technolo-
gies, able to incorporate rapidly changing research and
data into decision-making, and able to communicate
eﬀectively with a variety of stakeholders. In response
to this need, we have initiated an integrated graduate
training program and invite applications for two MS
Fellowships to begin January 2012.
Our goal is to create a small cohort of graduate stu-
dents whose research will be linked under the theme
“Managing for Resilience in Forested Ecosystems of the
Intermountain West”. This program will use emerg-
ing research tools, common coursework, seminars and
speciﬁc shared extension projects to provide the stu-
dent fellows with skills and knowledge necessary for
eﬀective science-based input to management decisions
about forested landscapes undergoing or threatened
with large-scale change. Current topics related to man-
agement, adaptation, resilience and human dimensions
of forest ecosystems and their components in a chang-
ing climate will be emphasized. Student fellows will
participate in several outreach projects in cooperation
with USU Extension Forestry during their time at USU
including the planning of a Restoring the West regional
conference, and publication of at least one article each
in the Utah Forest News. The student fellows willJanuary 1, 2012 EvolDir 45
also beneﬁt from coordinated mentoring by an Advi-
sory Board of faculty members who have active research
programs in dynamic forested landscapes.
Application: To apply for one of the MS Fellowships,
please submit the following materials to Dr. Karen
Mock via email
(karen.mock@usu.edu):
* A resume describing your education, employment,
and publication/presentation history, * A list of three
references (and their contact information), * A copy of
your academic transcripts (unoﬃcial) and GRE scores,
* A cover letter describing your research interests, why
you would be a good candidate for this Fellowship, and
how you found the Fellowship advertisement.
We will begin screening candidates on March 5,
2012, and will continue until suitable candidates are
found. Formal application to the USU graduate
school will ultimately be required for selected candi-
dates. For additional information please see http:/-

ArabidopsisAdaptiveVariation
PhD position at the University of Zurich: Plant Sci-
ences and Policy
The project oﬀered, entitled “ Adaptation and biodi-
versity in alpine habitats - integrating genomic and eco-
logical perspectives” aims to combine both fundamen-
tal science, with policy and conservation strategy. The
student will experience an interdisciplinary research en-
vironment (including molecular genetics and ﬁeld eco-
logical research) as part of two diverse research groups
(spending approximately 50% time with each group),
co-supervised by two PIs with diﬀerent backgrounds:
(1) Prof. Dr Kentaro Shimizu, Institute of Evolution-
ary Biology and Environmental Studies / Institute
of Plant Biology, University of Zurich ( http://-
www.ieu.uzh.ch/research/evolbiol/ecogenomics.html,
http://www.botinst.uzh.ch/research/genomics/-
shimizu.html ) (2) Prof. Dr Alex Widmer, Institute of
Integrative Biology, ETHZ ( http://www.env.ethz.ch/-
people/professors/fullprofessors/awidmer )
Summary: Most climate models indicate that global
warming will strongly impact alpine ﬂoras worldwide,
causing alpine habitats to experience rapid and dra-
matic environmental changes. Understanding how
plants are adapted to their environment and can per-
sist under changing climatic conditions is therefore not46 EvolDir January 1, 2012
only of prime interest from a fundamental scientiﬁc per-
spective, but also from a political and conservation per-
spective. Developing policies and implementing conser-
vation strategies can only be done once a deeper under-
standing of the fundamental processes underlying sur-
vival and adaptation in alpine environments has been
achieved. However, despite the great interest in alpine
plants and their adaptations to extreme environmental
conditions, little is known about the genetic and molec-
ular basis of altitudinal adaptations, which is primarily
a consequence of the lack of suitable study organisms
with genetic and genomic resources.
Scientiﬁc objectives:
Here we propose to study altitudinal adaptation in sev-
eral Arabidopsis relatives, allowing us to take advantage
of the wealth of genomic and genetic resources avail-
able for this model organism. Key questions include:
Which genes are responsible for altitudinal adaptation
and what is the function of these genes? Are the same
genes responsible for altitudinal adaptation in multi-
ple species or in diﬀerent geographical areas? What is
the adaptive value of the studied candidate genes under
contrasting environmental conditions?
Policy related objectives:
The work of scientists is often quite separate from the
work of those bodies that develop policy, and while
one party may inﬂuence the other, interaction is scarce.
This PhD program oﬀers an opportunity to bridge this
gap, as the ﬁndings from this project will help in the
development of eﬃcient conservation policies in alpine
ecosystems.
Speciﬁcation:
A Masters level degree or equivalent in an appropri-
ate ﬁeld is essential, and some experience in molecular
genetics would be distinctly beneﬁcial. Proﬁciency in
English is also required.
To apply:
Please send your CV (including a brief description of
your practical experience and grades), a brief statement
of scientiﬁc interests (no more than two pages) and the
details of two academic references (preferably by email).
The review of applications will commence in mid De-
cember, and will continue until the position is ﬁlled.

PhD position:
Understanding virulence of fungi towards malaria
mosquitoes using experimental evolution
We seek a PhD student for research on the mecha-
nisms of fungal pathogenicity for the malaria mosquito
Anopheles gambiae and to assess potential avenues of
fungal resistance. Development of pesticide resistance
shows that pesticides are not a long-term solution for
the control of malaria mosquitos, leading to a pressing
need for the development of alternative means of disease
control that avoid resistance. The entomopathogenic
fungus Beauveria bassiana has recently been success-
fully used in controlling populations of mosquitoes in
African houses and villages, thereby signiﬁcantly reduc-
ing the risk of human infection. To make this approach
more eﬀective and to anticipate the potential develop-
ment of fungal resistance by the mosquito, we need to
understand the components and mechanisms of fungal
virulence. We will use two approaches, (i) phenotypic
and genetic analysis of fungal strains from relevant ge-
ographic locations, and (ii) experimental evolution of
increased virulence. We will study the diﬀerences ob-
served within and between these approaches at the phe-
notypic and genetic level by using gene-expression and
DNA-sequence analyses. We will identify key mecha-
nisms of virulence and quantify to what extent they
each contribute to genetic variation in natural popula-
tions.
Who we are: The project is a collaboration within Wa-
geningen University of the Chair groups of Genetics,
Entomology, and Phytopathology. The interrelation-
ship between genetics, heredity and evolution is the
focus of research of the Laboratory of Genetics. Cen-
tral is the study of genetic variation that ranges from
the processes that produce it, to the factors that haveshaped its architecture in the past, and to the factors
and processes that determine its future. The research
on insect-vertebrate interactions of the Laboratory of
Entomology addresses the interactions between insects
and vertebrates (animals & humans) from the cellu-
lar to the community level. The research of the Lab-
oratory of Phytopathology aims to gain fundamental
knowledge about functional genomics aspects of plant
pathogenic fungi and oomycetes, the interaction with
their host plants and the interaction with bacteria that
occur in the rhizosphere. The collaboration between
these research groups reﬂects the diﬀerent levels of or-
ganization that will be addressed and the variation in
expertise that are combined in this project. From this
the PhD-student is expected to greatly beneﬁt. The
student will be based at the Laboratory of Genetics, as
most of the experimental work will be done here. The
other Chair groups are within 5 minutes reach of the
Laboratory of Genetics.
We ask: The successful candidate should have a MSc
degree in Biology, Animal Sciences, Environmental Sci-
ences, the Life Sciences and/or biotechnology, with a
keen interest in linking genetic variation to functional
phenotypes and ﬁtness. The candidate will be proﬁ-
cient in the English language. Creativity, intelligence
and enjoying to work on complex problems in a multi-
disciplinary team, is much more important than a spe-
ciﬁc educational background. Within Wageningen Uni-
versity, PhD students are encouraged to supervise MSc
thesis students when such opportunities arise.
We oﬀer: A full-time position (38 hours), initially for
1 year after which a go/no go decision will be taken
on extension with another three years. Gross salary
per month 2042,= in the ﬁrst year rising to 2612,per
month in the fourth year, for a fulltime appointment.
The candidate will be based at the Laboratory of Ge-
netics in Wageningen.

of putative mRNA sequences obtained from a 454 tis-
sue speciﬁc transcriptome to identify matches between
the two sources of data; *ii*) to compare the transcrip-
tomic database with other genomic, transcriptomic and
proteomic databases (such as NCBI, Ensembl, UNIprot
and Littorina’s database) in order to identify putative
mRNAs. The candidate will be identiﬁed as an author
on articles resulting from this work.
Essential qualiﬁcations are: motivation, autonomy, pro-
gramming experience and previous experience in work-
ing in transcriptomic/genomic projects and ability to

Conservation Biology We seek to capitalise on our
strengths in conservation and ecology. Stirling City has
become a centre for conservation activity in Scotland,
with a plethora of environmental organisations with of-
ﬁces or head oﬃces on, or close to, the University cam-
pus (e.g. BTCV, Buglife, BTO, RSPB, Plantlife, Bat
Conservation, Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Butter-
ﬂy Conservation, Wildfowl and Wetland Trust, BRISC,
SNH, SEPA etc.). Of these, BTO, BBCT, RSPB,WWT have oﬃces within Biological and Environmen-
tal Sciences. This provides an unrivalled opportunity
for collaboration and cooperation. The synergies to be
gained from research and active conservation working
hand in hand are neatly demonstrated by the success
of the home-grown Bumblebee Conservation Trust, now
with 8,000 members nationwide and a signiﬁcant con-
tributor to research funding at Stirling. The role of
Stirling staﬀ in establishing the trust is being used as
an exemplar statement of research impact by HEFCE
(Higher Education Funding Council for England). Stir-
ling is an established leader in this ﬁeld in Scotland, and
is the natural partner for governmental organizations
(e.g. SNH, SEPA) in providing the science base needed
to inform strategic responses to issues such as: climate
change and its implications; the global biodiversity cri-
sis and the conﬂicting pressures on land use; provision
of secure and sustainable ecosystem services; assess-
ments and impacts of contaminated land; and aquatic
conservation and restoration. This research focus also
dovetails neatly with the cross-research council priority
initiative “Living with Environmental Change”.
Ecosystem Services and/or Environmental Geography
One of the great challenges facing Humankind is en-
suring that we maintain the Ecosystem Services upon
which we depend for our survival and health in the face
of growing pressures on the environment. Living with
Environmental Change has a signiﬁcant focus on the
provision of ecosystem services (e.g. pollination; car-
bon cycling and sequestration; clean air, soil and water;
ﬂood control and prevention, sustainable soils, resource
management), and we seek a specialist in this area to
enable critical mass to be attained. This is a subject
area of growing interest to government and at interna-
tional development level and applicants whose research
has societal relevance and policy linkages are encour-
aged to apply. The scope encompasses the maintenance
of the ecological and biogeochemical cycles upon which
we depend, through provision of food, fuel and ﬁbre,
to issues concerning human health, cultural and social
identity and environmental hazard mitigation.
Environmental/Ecosystem Modelling Much of BES re-
search is empirically or process based. To evaluate fully
the signiﬁcance and impact of environmental change
and anthropogenic disturbance on the environment and
its resilience, including that of Humankind, requires the
development of our modelling capabilities. The abil-
ity to explore and predict the impacts of environmen-
tal change and disturbance will complement existing
expertise and provide eﬀective tools for environmental
management and conservation, and further support for
science-policy and regulatory linkages. We are seeking
applicants with an interest in applying modelling ap-January 1, 2012 EvolDir 67
proaches to understanding environmental and/or eco-
logical systems, and those with explicit focus on ge-
ographical processes/patterns, and their analysis, are
strongly encouraged to apply.

ASokoloﬀ has passed away
Alexander Sokoloﬀ 1920-2011
Alex Sokoloﬀ is widely regarded as “The Father of Tri-
bolium Genetics”. Alex was of Russian ancestry, but
he was born in Japan, and lived there for the ﬁrst three
years of his life. He lived and worked for extended pe-
riods in Mexico, and of course in America. He was a
true cosmopolitan. He was a disciple of the great evo-
lutionary biologist, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and kept
up a lifelong correspondence with Dobzhansky. Many
of their letters are reproduced in Sokoloﬀ’s fascinat-
ing memoir, published a few years ago. Sokoloﬀ had
the great foresight to see the potential of Tribolium as
a model insect for genetic studies as early as the late
1950’s, while a graduate student in the laboratory of
Thomas Park. He discovered and described hundreds
of genetic mutants in Tribolium, many of which are
still in use and are housed in the world Tribolium Stock
Center at the USDA-ARS Center for Grain and Animal
Health Research, Manhattan, KS. His early work pro-
vided a spark that helped facilitate the blossoming of
the arthropod genomics community in Manhattan, and
that culminated in the complete genome sequencing of
Tribolium castaneum, the ﬁrst genome completed for
any beetle and for any insect pest of agriculture. The
International Tribolium Meeting is now an annual event
in Europe and America. Although Alex was never able
to attend, these meetings might never have come into
existence if not for his pioneering work, and his inspira-
tion of a new generation of Tribolium researchers. His
four monographs, published from 1966-1977, are still
regarded as the authoritative original sources for infor-
mation on Tribolium genetics and biology.

DAMBE workshop Ottawa interest
Dear All,
I intend to oﬀer a one-day workshop entitled “Phyloge-
netics with DAMBE” either right before or after Evo-
lution 2012 in Ottawa (either on Jul. 5 or on Jul. 11,
2012), and wish to know how many people might be in-
terested in attending such a workshop. The topics will
include
(1) routine phylogenetic analyses and dating methods
(both the conventional dating with internal node cal-
ibration or tip- dating which is used mainly for viral
sequences sampled over diﬀerent years)
(2) Phylogeny-based comparative methods.
(3) Evolutionary genomics
There might be a fee (but no more than $20/person)

Evolution lab suggestions
Dear colleagues,
I am designing an upper-level undergraduate Evolution-
ary Biology Laboratory course, as an addition to the
lecture. I am seeking suggestions on what lab activities
will be good for this 2-hour 1-credit course. Ideally, I
would like to have diﬀerent activities for the lab, includ-
ing computer simulations (on genetic drift, etc.), exer-
cise in taxonomy and molecular phylogeny, and wet-lab
experiments. I would like to hear your opinions on what
computer programs are particularly good for the ﬁrst
two types of activities, and I will greatly appreciate
your suggestions on experimental lab activities which
could be run in the time of one class, across a few weeks
or the whole semester and can potentially produce pub-
lishable results. If you have taught any of the above lab
activities, I would like to hear from you on what works,
what does not, and your suggestions for improvement.
I will compile the suggestions and comments received
and make them available here.
In addition, I am trying to put together a fossil col-
lection for teaching purpose. If you have some fossils
you think could be used for teaching and would like to
donate, please send me a note and I will provide you
the address where they can be sent to. Sorry I cannot
aﬀord to buy your fossils, but I plan to reimburse you
for the shipping cost.
Thanks a lot,

Re: Other: Evolution lab suggestions
Dear Xianfa I am not sure what range of experiments
you are considering, but there is one very simple one
that always goes down well that demonstrates very
nicely the power/signiﬁcance of drift, bottlenecks etc
in genetic data. The classic ’resampling beads’ experi-
ment. If you don’t know it its very simple.
You need, per group, a bag, and a selection of beads.
Ideally say 100 of 3+ diﬀerent colours (100 red, 100January 1, 2012 EvolDir 71
blue, 100 yellow)
Basic idea is you start them by putting predetermined
mix of 100 beads in a bag. Then to simulate bottle-
necks, or drift, they just pick an appropriate number of
beads randomly from the bag, which of course will vary
a bit from the original ratio due to stochasticity. Then
you get them to count and record the new frequency,
multiply them up to 100 by adding new beads at the
same ratio, and then repeat. After about 4-5 genera-
tions they can really see how the frequency is drifting
away. Its a real eye opener for many students who don’t
initially get how drift can happen. Of course you can
easily simulate bottlenecks, expansions, etc.
Very cheap. Very obvious. Very easy to modify to more
or less complex situations.
There are computer programs that do this too, but
frankly the hands on way is in my experience way more
fruitful. As many are sceptical of computers...they
think its preprogrammed to do it. But actually see-
ing drift ﬁrst hand...
Hope this helps

Fish equipment
Hi fellow evolutionary biologists!
This may be an unconventional way of getting an exper-
imental setup together, but in the light of little funding
on the one side, and potentially dust-gathering equip-
ment that is stored away in some University basement
on the other, I would like to enquire if anyone may have
second-hand equipment for sale that may be used for
measuring performance in small ﬁsh.
For my research in zebraﬁsh I am currently most in-
terested in equipment than can be used to a) measure
endurance (i.e. some sort of ﬂume) and b) velocity (ei-
ther burst speed or along a track). However, I would
very much appreciate additional feedback and sugges-
tions and am going to consider any oﬀers!

Molecular dating software answers
Dear all,
a couple of weeks ago I posted a request (below) for a
molecular dating software suitable to be used program-
matically in a sort of pipeline.
Replies (shortened) follow, as some of you requested.
My feeling is that, although some methods exist that
are very accurate and leave to the operator an ample
ﬂexibility in terms of analysis design and parameter
tweaking, none of these seem to be really optimal to
work in the context of simulations/database automated
analyses, where analyses have to be fast, robust and run
(as much as possible) unsupervised, even at the expense
of some accuracy/ﬂexibility. Maybe there’s some space
for improvement here.
..I am not really sure it can do what you want, but have
you consider the ape package in R? (Miguel)
..MCMCTREE is easy and eﬀective. http:/-
/abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html You can
ﬁnd a step by step manual in the end of this web-
site. I think you can implement MCMCTREE in your
pipeline. You can also implement MULTIDIVTIME in
the pipeline, but MULTIDIVTIME is little bit old soft-
ware. (Jun)
..Have you looked at mcmctree in PAML? (Shige)
..You may use DAMBE. The download site also has a
set of tutorials. The last one (#12, I believe) is on
dating. The method is in Xia and Yang (2011, MPE).
You read in sequences, input a tree, right-click one or
more nodes and enter the calibration time, set the op-
tions, and click Run. It is extremely fast and accurate.
(Xuhua)
..do you have access to a server (or set of servers)? If
so, then you could get access to condor and use it to
submit and manage the execution of jobs. I suggest this
because we use condor for this purpose on a cluster of
computers (94 CPUs) ... As for using BEAST, I agree
that is recommended. (Lars)
..if you use command line version of beast and write aJanuary 1, 2012 EvolDir 73
good executable ﬁle to run all your ﬁles one after the
other it will need no supervision at all, so maybe this
would be a good solution for you. (Martyna)

Dear all,
I am looking for a molecular dating software that:
- works on a ﬁxed topology and estimates dates/node-
heights based on DNA sequences - produces a conﬁ-
dence interval for dates/node-heights - is fast (20 seq,
1kb, 1 minute)
and if possible:
- is reasonably accurate - allows partitioning of the
dataset (if applicable) - is model based - can be invoked
programmatically under linux
I would generally use BEAST, but this time the analysis
has to be repeated many times and with little super-
vision, in a sort of pipeline, hence BEAST would be
problematic.
Any help will be appreciated,

Monomorphic microsatellites
Dear Evoldir members,
We have characterized and isolated nuclear microsatel-
lite loci from enriched libaries that were sequenced on a
454 sequencer. Dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranu-cleotide repeats motif within 454 sequence data were
searched using the program MSATCOMMANDER ver-
sion 0.8.1 and primers designed with Primer3. However,
only 3 polymorphic loci (with only two or three alleles)
have been recorded, while 13 monomorphic microsatel-
lites loci have been detected in an endangered endemic
plant species of Tenerife Island (Canary Islands). There
are only 4 natural populations of this endemism de-
scribed, which include 170 individuals. So, our question
is: Is the low genetic diversity detected a real biological
phenomenon or an artifact of the technique?

Optics book
Dear colleagues,
I wanted to let you know that now in print is an “optics
for biologists” book written by Sonke Johnsen of Duke
University. It is called “The Optics of Life”. The book
is meant to be an accessible, humorous, and practi-
cal introduction to understanding and measuring light.
It’s oﬃcially aimed at biologists, but I think it could be
useful to anyone who wants to get started in this fas-
cinating, but potentially confusing subject. Of course
many topics in evolutionary biology hinge on the inter-
actions of organisms and light, so I thought there could
be some interest in the evoldir community.
If you’re interested, it’s available at Amazon and di-
rectly from Princeton Press (for the same price):

Proposals K-12 education
Request for proposals in K-12 evolution education for
underrepresented minorities
Deadline: January 1, 2012
As part of ongoing eﬀorts to increase diversity in evo-
lutionary science, the National Evolutionary Synthesis
Center is sponsoring a range of targeted activities in the
general area of $B!H(BK-12 Evolution Education for
Underrepresented Minorities.“ We seek to support one
or more Catalysis Meetings, Working Groups or other
synergistic activities that lead to the creation of new
programs, activities or initiatives designed to increase
exposure and participation in evolutionary science by
K-12 minority students who are historically underrep-
resented in the discipline.
In particular, proposals that are signiﬁcantly interdis-
ciplinary, and that demonstrate a mix of senior and
emerging researchers, including graduate students, are
encouraged. Competitive proposals will not only de-
ﬁne the target audience(s) and outline strategies for
developing innovative activities, but will also include
detailed plans for implementation and assessment. Pro-
posals should also indicate how activities and programs
align with state and/or federal education standards.
NESCent invites researchers to submit proposals for
two kinds of meetings:January 1, 2012 EvolDir 75
Catalysis Meetings: These one-time meetings bring to-
gether ~30 scientists from diverse disciplines to focus
on a major question or research area in evolutionary
science. Catalysis Meetings typically last for 3-5 days.
Working Groups: Working Groups involve small groups
of scientists (10-12 participants) collaborating inten-
sively on the analysis or synthesis of data, models or
both, to address a major question in evolutionary sci-
ence. Working groups will typically meet 3-4 times over
two years, with each meeting lasting 3-5 days.
Synergistic Activities: We also strongly encourage link-
ages among our science programs (see url below). We
invite proposals that plan synergistic activities between
two or more of the following: working groups, cataly-
sis meetings, postdoctoral fellows, sabbatical scholars,
short-term fellows, and graduate students. Proposals
for each of these must be submitted separately; they
should include a clear statement of linkage between pro-
posals (including clear identiﬁcations in each of the sep-
arate proposals of which proposals are linked).
NESCent will not support collection of new data or ﬁeld
research, but encourages the synthesis of existing data
and information resources. NESCent is committed to
making data, databases, software and other products
that are developed as part of NESCent activities avail-
able to the broader scientiﬁc community.
To learn more about the various types of propos-
als, and the proposal process, please visit https://-

Software BayesRate release
BayesRate v.1.1 has been released
BayesRate is a program to estimate speciation and ex-
tinction rates from dated phylogenies in a Bayesian
framework. The method is described in BMC Evo-
lutionary Biology by Silvestro, Schnitzler, and Zizka
(2011) and uses an MCMC algorithm to estimate the
rate parameters while accounting for phylogenetic un-
certainty.
Diﬀerent models of diversiﬁcation are implemented to
allow rate variation through time and between clades,
and to correct for incomplete taxon sampling. The pro-
gram is particularly suitable to test hypotheses of di-
versiﬁcation that the user can deﬁne as priors and con-
straints in the analysis.
For model selection and hypothesis testing, thermody-
namic integration (Lartillot and Philippe 2006) is used
to calculate the marginal likelihood of a model and per-
form Bayes factor tests.
BayesRate is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
It requires Python and R, plus a few additional libraries
as detailed in the manual.

Software CLUSTER DIST
Dear all,
A new software is freely available on my web page (see
below). CLUSTER DIST is intended to separate indi-
viduals in genetically homogeneous groups (i.e. clus-
ters) following the approach presented in Rodr´ ıguezRamilo et al. (2009 Genetics Selection Evolution 41:
49). As stated in that paper, the basic idea is group-
ing the individuals in such a way that the average ge-
netic distance between a predeﬁned number of clusters
is maximised. From all the genetic distances previously
published in the literature, the program calculates the
Nei minimum distance, one of the most used. There-
fore, no assumptions on the Hardy-Weinberg or linkage
equilibrium are made for the used markers.

Software Nemo QuantiTraitLoci
v220
Nemo v2.2.0 [29 Nov 2011]
A new version of the population genetics simulation
software Nemo has been released.
In this new version, up to two genetically correlated
quantitative (phenotypic) traits can be modeled, based
on multiple pleiotropic and additive quantitative loci.
Selection on the quantitative traits can be spatially and
temporally heterogenous. Nemo2.2.0 thus allows for
the simulation of diﬀerent scenarios of local adaptation
and adaptive divergence among populations connected
by gene ﬂow, among other things.
The code released here forms the basis of work previ-
ously published in Evolution by Guillaume & Whitlock
(2007), Yeaman & Guillaume (2009), Guillaume (2011),
and Yeaman & Whitlock (2011).
Check the website for more information and down-
loads: http://nemo2.sourceforge.net If you decide to
use Nemo, please register to the mailing list, and re-
port bugs!
Happy simulations!

— What is Nemo?January 1, 2012 EvolDir 77
Nemo is a forward-time, individual-based, genetically
explicit, and stochastic simulation program designed to
study the evolution of life history and phenotypic traits,
and population genetics in a ﬂexible (meta-)population
framework.
Nemo implements diﬀerent traits with a variety
of genetic architectures, from neutral markers (m-
sat, SNP), to deleterious mutations and quantitative
trait loci (QTL), some with sex-speciﬁc expression
(e.g., dispersal genes, female-inherited Cytoplasmic-
Incompatibility mutations, etc.).
All this is framed within a ﬂexible metapopulation
model that allows for patch-speciﬁc carrying capaci-
ties, dispersal rates, stochastic extinction/harvesting
rates, and demographic stochasticity. Populations can
be dynamically modiﬁed during a simulation, allowing
for population bottlenecks, patch fusion/ﬁssion, pop-
ulation expansion, etc. Selection on the quantitative
traits can also vary during the course of a simulation
and among the demes within a population.
The life cycle is also ﬂexible, with many diﬀerent events
that can be included when needed (reproduction, mi-
gration, selection, crossing, regulation, etc.). Nemo also
oﬀers the possibility to output many diﬀerent statistics
recorded during simulation runs.
— What is the diﬀerence with quantiNEMO?
quantiNEMO (Neuenschwander et al. 2008) also imple-
ments quantitative traits. Its implementation is how-
ever based on a diﬀerent mutation model (i.e., discrete
number of alleles per locus versus continuum-of-allele
model) and does not allow for pleiotropic loci. quan-
tiNEMO thus doesn’t oﬀer the possibility to model ge-
netically correlated traits. The model however allows
for epistatic interactions among loci.
quantiNEMO is based on an older version of Nemo (pre-
2.1.0) from which it implements the dispersal models,
neutral trait, and the metapopulation framework, while
improving some aspects of those elements. It how-

Speciation travel grants
Dear colleagues,
The European Research Networking Programme “Fron-
tiers of Speciation Research”, supported by 18 National
Funding Organizations in member countries of the Eu-
ropean Science Foundation, is inviting applications for
travel grants intended to foster collaborations between
European researchers working on topics related to the
Programme.
Support is available for short visits (up to 2 weeks)
and exchange grants (up to 3 months), with preference
given to junior researchers at a graduate or postdoc-
toral level. A typical grant covers between EUR 1500
and EUR 2000. Applicants will want to keep in mind
that, reﬂecting the availability of funds, applications for
smaller grants are more likely to succeed than applica-
tions for larger grants, and that granted amounts are
typically adjusted relative to solicited amounts so as to
promote equity among selected candidates.
Applications are reviewed quarterly after a submis-
sion deadline of 24:00 CET on 15 March, 15 June, 1578 EvolDir January 1, 2012
September, and 15 December. About 4-6 weeks after
each deadline, the ESF will inform applicants about the
outcome of evaluations.

The Computational Genomics Group in the John
Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National
University (Canberra, Australia) have made pioneering
contributions to our understanding of genetic diversity
within and between mammal species in areas including:
the genomic distribution of linkage disequilibrium, hu-
man molecular adaptation, the inﬂuence of sex on mu-
tation rates, the relationship between epigenetic state
and genetic variation, and the radiation of mammals.
These contributions have been accompanied by signif-
icant methodology developments in the form of both
novel statistical models and open source software for
analyses of genomic diversity. Our recent advances in
models of context-dependent substitution, for instance,
represent a signiﬁcant advance in robust estimation of
the mode of natural selection.We are seeking outstanding applicants for a postdoc-
toral fellowship. The individual will work on the devel-
opment and application of improved models of sequence
divergence, joining a highly productive collaboration
between Associate Professors Gavin Huttley and Von
Bing Yap (Department of Statistics and Applied Proba-
bility, National University of Singapore). The work will
build on the PyCogent open source software toolkit for
statistical modelling of molecular evolution developed
in the Huttley lab.

eas will thus include speciation genomics, mouse pop-
ulation genetics and evolutionary history, method de-
velopment for analysis of next-generation sequencing
data sets, natural selection detection and characterisa-
tion, and population genetics theory. The successful
candidate will be in charge of designing NGS exper-
iments, analysing and interpreting data and handling
manuscript preparation.

tween plants and soil symbionts.
This project will investigate the evolution of associa-
tions between plants and soil mutualists (rhizobial bac-
teria and mycorrhizal fungi). These interactions take
place within potentially complex networks composing
a diverse array of potential partners and competitors.
Characterizing these complex networks and identify-
ing the biotic and environmental factors that determine
how they are assembled is an important step towards
understanding how eﬀective mutualisms between plants
and soil microbe evolve and persist. This work will uti-
lize interactions between native Australian legumes and
their associated soil symbionts. These systems provide
an ideal model for testing hypotheses regarding how
the community composition and function of symbiotic
organisms is shaped by interactions with hosts, environ-
mental heterogeneity (e.g. soil chemistry) and spatial
variation. The postdoctoral fellow will have access to a
recently developed and comprehensive host phylogeny
(Acacia) to use as a foundation to design a project in-
vestigating the role of evolutionary history in structur-
ing host symbiont interactions in an ecologically impor-

We seek a highly motivated and productive postdoc-
toral researcher to work on NSF-funded*, collaborative
research on Phylogenetics and Convergent Evolution of
Sexual dimorphism in sarsielloid Ostracoda. The post-
doc would work at the University of California-Santa

The postdoc will ﬁrst lead collecting expeditions in Cal-
ifornia, Belize, and Australia/New Zealand. Next, the
postdoc will obtain high-throughput sequencing data
to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of sarsielloid
ostracods. We hypothesize that a radical sexual dimor-
phism – where only males have eyes – evolved multiple
times in the group. We are developing phylogenetics
tools in the Galaxy Bioinformatics Platform to analyze
the data. The postdoc will also facilitate collaborative
experiments with the laboratory of Ajna Rivera at Uni-
versity of the Paciﬁc, to determine expression patterns
of known eye development genes in convergent ostracod
species.
The position requires an individual with a PhD and ex-
perience in phylogenetics, bioinformatics, invertebrate
zoology or related ﬁelds. Collecting requires snorkel-
ing, moderate free diving to collect sediment near coral
reefs, and long hours at a microscope. In addition to
a willingness to learn to collect and identify ostracods,
outstanding molecular, computational and/or quanti-
tative skills and a willingness to develop bioinformatics
tools in Galaxy are particularly advantageous.
Funding is available for a 12-month position, for a mini-

Host-Parasite Evolution and Genomics
Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge
Two ERC funded post-doctoral positions, lasting three
to ﬁve years, are available to investigate genetic varia-
tion in the susceptibility of Drosophila to viral infection.
Insects vary in their susceptibility to viral infection,
and this variation aﬀects disease transmission by vector
species, and the survival of beneﬁcial insects and pests.
The successful candidates will investigate the genetic
basis of this variation in Drosophila using next gener-
ation sequencing, published genome sequences and the
tools of Drosophila genetics. This will not only give
insights into the molecular and cellular basis of how
resistance to viruses evolves in nature, but population
genetic approaches will also allow us to understand thefactors that maintain variation in susceptibility to in-
fection in populations. There will be scope for the suc-
cessful applicant to drive the direction of their research,
and they will be expected to collaborate closely with
other post-docs in the lab.
We are seeking highly motivated candidates who have a
deep interest in this area of research. Applicants must
have, or will shortly obtain, a PhD. Ideally the can-
didate’s past work will be in genetics or evolutionary
biology. However, this is a ﬁve year project that will
include several researchers, so we are seeking applicants
with a range of diﬀerent interests and skills. Relevant
experience would include any of the following: popula-
tion genetic analysis, the analysis of next-generation se-
quencing data, Drosophila genetics, and host-pathogen
evolution and genetics.

chemical defence: trade-oﬀs, noise or alternative strate-
gies?
The newly appointed Centre of Excellence in Biological
Interactions funded by the Academy of Finland calls for
applications for a post doc position focusing on within-
species variation in chemical defence.
Defensive toxins are widely used by animals, plants and
micro-organisms to deter natural enemies. The main-
tenance of toxin diversity both in quality and quantity
is an important ecological question that requires con-
sideration from an evolutionary perspective. The post
doc will seek alternative evolutionary explanations for
the persistence of variation, and will study toxin di-
versity by focusing on 1) why some individuals lack de-
fence in an otherwise toxic prey population (cheating by
automimicry), 2) why the toxin content of individuals
varies within a population and 3) why the chemical con-
stituents of defence vary. Flavobacterium columnare
and the wood tiger moth Parasemia plantaginis will be
used as study species.
A successful candidate will have a PhD in evolution-
ary biology, ecology or a related discipline. She/he is
motivated, enjoys problem solving, has a strong back-
ground in designing and conducting experiments, and
has a record of successful publications. Experience in
chemical ecology or theoretical ecology is a bonus but
ability to work together with both theoreticians and
empirists is essential; therefore, excellent communica-
tion skills are required.

2 Postdoc positions in EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
(population genomics/comparative genomics)
Two postdoc positions in the lab of Axel Meyer
(http://www.evolutionsbiologie.uni-konstanz.de/-
index.php?section=10 ) in the Department of Biology
at the University of Konstanz in Germany are available
from March 2012 on.
The positions are for Ph.D. biologists, ideally with prior
experience in bioinformatics, molecular evolution or
population genomics. We have recently received fund-
ing through an ERC advanced grant for work on the
comparative genomics of parallel evolution of repeated
adaptive radiations of cichlid ﬁshes in Nicaragua (see:
Elmer and Meyer. 2011. Adaptation in the age of eco-
logical genomics: insights from parallelism and conver-
gence. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 26: 298-306).In the crater lakes of Nicaragua a natural experiment
is taking place. Several adaptive radiations of cichlid
ﬁshes formed independently within only a few thou-
sand years after colonization from a large ancestral
lake. These extremely young adaptive radiations con-
sist of species that arose in sympatry and evolved par-
allel adaptations (such as limnetic and benthic body
forms, hypertrophied lips and molariform dentition) re-
peatedly in their new habitats. We plan to establish
these Nicaraguan cichlids as a new ecological model
system. Through comparative and population genomic
approaches we plan to investigate the role and mech-
anisms of natural selection at the level of the entire
genome. We will ask, what is the genetic basis of
species diﬀerences and ecologically relevant morpholog-
ical traits that led to parallel adaptations? Through
comparative genomic and population genomic analyses
(including establishing a reference genome), genome re-
sequencing, and linkage, quantitative trait and associa-
tion mapping, we plan to identify genomic regions, can-
didate genes, and characterize the genetic diﬀerences
that contribute to the adaptive phenotypic diﬀerences
between extremely young species.

MicrobeGenomics
Global Warming and Forest Soil Microbiomes
Rapid advances in genomic sequencing technology are
expected to result in 100 gigabases of DNA sequence
data in a single day from a single machine within the
next ﬁve years. This is equivalent to sequencing 20,000
individual microbial genomes. The scale and complex-
ity of this data is transforming microbiology and in
particular ecological research. Genomic data provides
a foundation for an exciting “reverse ecology” frame-
work for determining underlying networks of interac-
tions within and between microbial communities. The
impact of this data on ecological and evolutionary biol-
ogy research will be dependent on designing new long-
term experiments and developing novel methods for an-
alyzing genomic data in the context of microbial com-
munity interactions.
During my sabbatical last year at Harvard Forest I be-
gan to two related projects. As part of a collabora-
tive summer REU project we began collect and archive
DNA samples from long-term soil warming experiments
(see Melillo et al. 2011 PNAS). We have recently been
funded to sequence a subset of samples from this site.
One goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that
microbial community composition, and in turn func-
tion, controls the response of plants to soil warming
and ultimately ecosystem carbon cycling. The second
project involves developing new computational meth-
ods to integrate analyses of species diversity and micro-
bial function using data from the warming sites, the Na-
tional Ecological Observatory Network and other large
scale sequencing projects at Harvard Forest. We have
several related projects ongoing in the lab including theisolation and characterization of novel bacteria involved
in degrading plant litter.
I am willing to sponsor a Darwin Fellow to continue
and expand my research projects at Harvard Forest. If
you are interested send me an email.

UppsalaU SpeciationGenomics
Post-doc Position in Avian Speciation Genomics
A post-doc position in speciation genomics is available
at the Department of Evolutionary Biology in Upp-
sala, Sweden in the research group of Dr. Jochen Wolf.
Funds are guaranteed for one year, but can be extended
to a two-year period, generally with good success.
Background The study of speciation mechanisms re-
mains one of the major challenges in fundamental bi-
ological research. The hybrid zone between carrion
and hooded crows (Corvus corone spec.) is a textbook
example of incipient speciation that is well character-
ized from an ecological and behavioural perspective. In
contrast, the genetic architecture of the hybrid zone
is poorly understood. The crow system represents a
case of a very early phase of species divergence that re-
quires new molecular approaches for its comprehensive
description.
The project The revolution in sequencing technology
allows us addressing its underlying genetic architecture
for the ﬁrst time using a combination of several ge-
nomic approaches. Currently, these include high qual-
ity genome assembly and annotation, a common-garden
based RNA-seq gene expression study and population
genomic analyses. The successful candidate will pri-
marily work with a large whole genome re-sequencing
data set from individuals collected all over Europe to
trace the species’ demography and unravel the deci-sive genetic changes between the two taxa (’60 crow
genomes project’).
Infrastructure We are a young, growing research group
with interests in molecular evolution and evolutionary
genomics with a primary focus on birds and mammals.
We form part of a recently launched Centre of Excel-
lence ( http://www.uceg.uu.se ) and SciLifeLab Uppsala
(http://www.scilifelab.uu.se/ ). The group is placed
within the Evolutionary Biology Centre which is one
of world???s leading research institutions in evolution-
ary biology that successfully bridges a broad variety of
disciplines in the biological sciences. It is situated in
the beautiful small town of Uppsala in Sweden, that of-
fers rich opportunities in cultural and outdoor activities
and is strongly inﬂuenced by the 40 000 students living
here. The Department of Evolutionary Biology excels
in many aspects of genetics and evolution and oﬀers an
inspiring atmosphere in an international group.
For further information visit our website: http://-
www.ebc.uu.se/Research/IEG/evbiol/research/Wolf/
If you are enthusiastic about evolutionary biology, have
a good understanding of population genetics, ideally
a strong background in coalescence theory and demo-
graphic modelling and/or are skilled in bioinformatic
programming you are most welcome to apply for the
position. Feel free to email me with an informal inquiry
before submitting an application. I am certainly also
happy to toss around other ideas you’d like to pursue
that are in line with the general research program.

Target participants: PhD students, advanced master
students
This workshop, based on a concept developed by Steve
Stearns and John Maynard Smith, takes place in a small
Alpine village (Arolla), which will allow you to focus
while being able to enjoy the landscape and the Alpine
ﬂora.
The main goals of this course are to develop the follow-
ing skills: . developing your scientiﬁc ideas through dis-
cussions in groups; . thinking critically and expressing
oneself clearly; . turning a general idea into a research
project; . writing a research proposal and defending it.
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You,
as a group, will decide what the important questions
in broadly deﬁned evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back seat.
Additionally, the faculty will give informal talks about
their research and be available for informal discussion
with individual students. At the end you will present
your projects to other participants, and we will party.
Costs: CHF 430.- for room and board.

Seville ConservationGenetics
Feb9-10
Workshop: There are spaces available for participants
on the workshop Merging Conservation Genetics and
Ecological Genomics ±, a scientiﬁc workshop organized
within the ConGenOmics ESF Research Network Pro-
gram. The workshop will be held 9-10 February 2012
in Seville, Spain
This workshop is the ﬁrst scientiﬁc workshop orga-
nized within the ESF Research Networking Programme
ConGenOmics. The goal of this workshop is to discuss
our current understanding in the ﬁeld of conservation
genomics and to indentify gaps in our current knowl-
edge regarding this research area. We will identify ﬁelds
of research of high priority in conservation genomics
and share and discuss the application of genomic tech-
nologies. We will also discuss how these genomic tech-
niques will help us addressing topical questions and in-
ﬂuence the future of conservation genomics. By bring-
ing together European and pan-European specialists on
conservation genomics we hope to develop and improve
the knowledge transfer of the technical advances and
challenges in conservation genomics.
The workshop addresses 3 major research topics which
will be represented in 3 separate sessions. Each ses-
sion is introduced by invited speakers who are experts
in the respective scientiﬁc ﬁelds. The invited speakers
will sketch the topical framework of each session, af-
ter which all participants are invited to provide further
input by means of topical discussions. Below you will
ﬁnd a short overview of the three research sessions anda list the speakers who will introduce the topics.
Session 1. The experimental studies of (genomic) mech-
anisms behind important biological processes of rele-
vance for conservation. In this session we will discuss
the research that aims to disentangle the genomic as-
pects of population genetic processes, and ﬁtness, in
a conservation context, including mechanisms such as:
(i) transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analy-
ses of inbreeding and outbreeding depression, (ii) ge-
nomic mechanisms of genotype-by-environment inter-
actions, (iii) the genomic signature and mechanisms of
local adaptation, (iv) genomic mechanisms behind phe-
notypic plasticity, (v) epigenetic mechanisms of adapta-
tion and evolution, and (vi) the dynamics of functional
gene variation in small populations, likely to be domi-
nated by genetic drift.
Session 2. The application and development of data
handling and processing strategies in conservation ge-
nomics. This session will focus on methods and tech-
niques for data handling. New genomic technologies
potentially allow deeper, higher resolution insights in
important demographic and population genetic param-
eters and processes, and will allow disentangling the
mechanisms involved in these processes. However these
new techniques generate large amounts of data, chal-
lenging traditional ways to deal with the data. In
this session, standard experimental protocols, the use
of limited research sources in the most eﬃcient way,
sharing genomic information and results at a European
and/or global scale and data handling procedures will
be discussed.
Session 3. The application of community and metage-
nomics in conservation biological context Conservation
genetics has traditionally focused on processes at the
population level, but at the same time acknowledged
that genetic variation at population level and processes
at species and community level are intricately related.
Metagenomics is the genomic analysis (most commonly
by means of next-generation sequencing technologies-
see above) of microbial communities. This new science
provides access to organisms that form the vast major-
ity of microorganisms on Earth. Metagenomics thereby
oﬀers a ﬁrst peek at the wide variety of life that has
never been studied, thus providing new insight into the
structure and function of ecosystems as diverse as a pol-
luted habitat or the gastrointestinal tract of an endan-
gered species. This session will focus on the studies that
incorporate meta-genomic monitoring in a conservation
genetic assessments, studies that aim to disentangle the
relationship between genetic and genomic variation at
population level and biodiversity and ecosystem func-
tioning, studies that target the inﬂuence of species in-
teractions on genetic variation and functional genomic108 EvolDir January 1, 2012
activity, and studies that aim to disentangle the ge-
nomic interactions between pathogens, parasites and
herbivores on one side and hosts on the other.
Location: The workshop will be held on the 9th and
10th of February 2012 in Foro de la Biodiversidad in
Seville in Spain and is hosted by Professor Carles Vila
from Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC). Held in an
informal but stimulating scientiﬁc atmosphere, with a
limited number of participants, we hope that this meet-
ing will provide an excellent opportunity for strong in-
teraction and brainstorming on the ﬁeld and future of
conservation genomics.

Jan16-27
European Course “Comparative Genomics”*
Organizers: Jean-Nicolas Volﬀ (ENS Lyon), C´ eline
Brochier (University of Lyon 1)
Credits: 6 ECTS
Large-scale comparison of whole genomes has revolu-
tionized our way to apprehend biology and has opened
new avenues of analysis of the mechanisms driving the
evolution of genes, genomes, biological networks and
processes, organisms, populations and species. Genome
comparison also helps to better understand phyloge-
netic relationships between organisms and to identify
genes of medical and industrial interest.
In the frame of the recent methodological revolution of
genome analysis, this course aims to initiate students to
Comparative Genomics, a modern and fast-evolving sci-
ence with ever growing impact on science and societies.
We will particularly put the emphasis on recent ma-
jor discoveries, innovating concepts and original strate-
gies in the domains of biology, ecology, medicine and
biotechnologies. Internationally reputed scientists will
present their work and interact with students during
conferences and round tables. The main strengths of
this course are:1- Topics related to hot recent discoveries
The topics covered by the course correspond to current
big questions tackled by comparative genomics. Ac-
cordingly, they can diﬀer from one year to the next. In
past editions of this course we spoke about transpos-
able elements, origin of new genes, gene and genome
duplications, sex chromosomes, phylogenomics, bacte-
rial genome evolution, evolutionary genomics and the
origin of humans, evolution of non-coding DNA, ge-
nomics of speciation, and genome architecture.
Past speakers include Michael Lynch (Indiana Uni-
versity), Deborah Charlesworth (University of Edin-
burgh), Ken Wolfe (Trinity College Dublin), Adam
Eyre-Walker (University of Sussex), Henrik Kaessmann
(University of Lausanne), Ed Green (University of Cal-
ifornia), Manfred Schartl (University of W¨ urzburg),
Aoife McLysaght (Trinity College Dublin), Alex Wid-
mer (ETH Zurich), Lluis Quintana-Murci (Pasteur
Institute Paris), Eduardo Rocha (Pasteur Institute
Paris), Nicolas Galtier (University of Montpellier), Lau-
rent Duret (University of Lyon), Manolo Gouy (Univer-
sity of Lyon), Emmanuel Douzery (University of Mont-
pellier), Hughes Roest-Crollius (ENS Paris) and Marc
Robinson-Rechavi (University of Lausanne). Tradition-
ally the course ends with a conference discussing the
future of comparative genomics and its growing impact
on societies. This conference was held by Bertrand Jor-
dan in 2009 and Bernard Dujon in 2010 and 2011.
2- A course with top scientists, organized in conferences
and round tables for students
The course is organized over two weeks, with a speciﬁc
topic for each day. Each topic is held by two speakers,
one in the morning and one in the afternoon, on com-
plementary aspects of the subject. Each conference will
begin with a general introduction to the topic (30 min)
followed by a presentation of the research performed
in the speaker’s laboratory (1 hour). Finally, a round
table of about one hour allows discussions between the
two scientists and students on the topic of the day.
3- A course favoring interactions between international
speakers and students
About half of speakers originate from foreign institu-
tions. In addition, the course is open to students from
other countries (generally 30-50% of the attending stu-
dents). Hence, “Comparative Genomics” is much more
similar to an international scientiﬁc meeting than to a
classical course. Accordingly, teaching and discussions
are all in English.

?Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics?. This ten full-
day course will take place at the EBC (Evolutionary
Biology Centre) at Uppsala University. The course
is open to graduate students, postdocs and other re-
searchers who are interested evolutionary quantitative
genetics.
The course will be based on Lynch & Walsh’s books
?Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits? (Vol.
1, http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/zbook/volume 1/-
vol1.html ) and ?Evolution and Selection of Quantita-
tive Traits? (Vol. 2, http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/-
zbook/volume 2/vol2.html ). It will cover a general
introduction to quantitative genetics and topics such
as resemblance between relatives, detecting genes
underlying complex traits, selection, multivariate se-
lection, multivariate response and gene by environment
interactions. The course will involve short exercises in
both R and Excel throughout so that there will be a
mix of both lectures and problem solving. Participants
are expected to bring their own laptop. The number
of participants is limited to 30. Participants will need
to cover their own travel and accommodation costs.
Uppsala, Sweden is located with only 30 minutes
to Stockholm- Arlanda international airport ( http:/-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.January 1, 2012 EvolDir 111
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
