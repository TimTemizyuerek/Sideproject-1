Abstract submission will open on the 7 ^th of March for
the above meeting, to be held at Blossin, close to Berlin,
Germany.
https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/-
arbeitsgruppen/zoologie/ag rol/Ecological-
Immunology-Workshop-2022/Home/index.html
The meeting is the next installment in a loose series of
workshops on ecological & evolutionary immunology
/ insect immunity, that started in 2001 in Sheeld,
the most recent one being in Blossin in 2017. These
meetings bring together researchers with dierent
backgrounds but with a shared interest in immunity
and host-microbe interactions, and where we encourage
the presentation of unpublished results.
The hallmark of these workshops is the open atmosphere,
fostering free exchange by keeping it an aordable, small
meeting ( ~85 participants). The format consists of in-
vited speakers, contributed talks and a dedicated poster
session. Long breaks provide plenty of opportunity for
informal exchange. Past workshops have initiated newcollaborations and ideas focusing on frontier research.^ a e
The premises are basic but in a beautiful location con-
ducive to the success of the meeting. We will be located
at a lakeside, which oers great swimming and canoeing,
and a small bar on the lakeside.

Dear All,
We are very happy to welcome you to a new season of
CIGENE seminars, please nd the schedule attached.
The rst presenter this season is Martin Kuhlwilm, As-
sistant Professor, University of Vienna. He will present:
Admixture in apes and humans and its consequences
Abstract: Admixture is an important topic in many
species, including humans and our extinct relatives.
Great apes also show patterns of admixture, and the
exchange of genetic material did have an impact on
these species as well. Studying their genomes guides our
understanding of adaptation and speciation.
Time: Wednesday, February 16th, 12:00-13:00 CET
Place: This will be an online seminar. For

Columbia TandemRepeats When
Dear evoldir community,
It is our greatest pleasure to announce our ESEB 2022
symposium \Tandem repeats: their role in molecular
evolution and methods" (S27), which is now open for
submissions (see https://www.eseb2022.cz for further
details).
Tandem repeats (TRs) are adjacent repetitive stretches
of genomic DNA, found in abundance across all king-
doms of life. TRs provide a rich source of variation
in populations, hence a perfect playground for natural
selection forces. Especially, shorter TRs are known for
their orders of magnitude high mutation rates compared
to SNPs and indels. TR-suitable methods and resources
are emerging one after the other allowing accurate TR
annotation and genotyping integrated into existing ge-
nomic pipeline workows. Analysis of TR variation in
populations and over longer evolutionary time suggest
STRs as a major contributor to complex traits heri-
tability with a major impact on protein function and
expression.
This symposium will focus on the typing approaches,
evolution, and functional analysis of these highly poly-
morphic elements. We aim to bring together both re-
searchers who develop and apply methods for accurate
STR genotyping, and identication of STRs relevant
for phenotypic evolution, and recent adaptations. Thisway, the symposium will facilitate interactions between
researchers from dierent backgrounds and promote the
interdisciplinary study of the STRs, an emerging major
source of phenotypic variation. Therefore, we expect
this symposium to be of interest to a broad range of
researchers in the elds of bioinformatics, population
genomics, and evolutionary biology.
Keynote speakers:
Melissa Gymrek, UCSD, California
Miguel Andrade, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz
Organisers:
Tugce Bilgin, Columbia University, New York
Maria Anisimova, ZHAW, Zurich
Abstracts can be submitted on:

Deadline is April 15 2022.
ESEB also proposes a grant in order to ensure equal
opportunities. For further details:

event/conservation-genomics-at-the-population-level-
20221130/ Population level analysis of complete
genomes is becoming a reality for many species. This
new conference will address the dierent challenges and
applications of population-level conservation genomics.
Sessions will focus on detecting adaptation and
deleterious variation in populations, and linking genetic
variation to phenotypic variation. New technologies for
data collection and application of genomic insights for
biodiversity conservation will be explored. The likely
impact of genomic approaches on conservation eorts
over the next decade will be discussed.March 1, 2022 EvolDir 5
This meeting will bring together scientists addressing
the challenges and opportunities arising from the rapid
development of population-level conservation genomics.
As the methods discussed will be cutting-edge, those
interested in population and evolutionary genomics in
other communities may benet learning and applying
similar techniques to their own research.
This conference will be a hybrid meeting - with onsite
or virtual attendance.

Online GenotypePhenotype Mar2-4
Hi all,
many thanks for the excitingly positive response to
our virtual meeting \Mind the gap: From Genotype to
Phenotype and the role of Modelling, Genomic Predic-
tion and Development" organized by the Developmental
Biology section of the German Zoological Society. We
already received more registrations than expected, show-
ing us that the topic is relevant for many of you. Sucha positive response promises thorough and interesting
discussions throughout the meeting. To trigger the
discussion sessions, we need you to tell us about your
research! Maybe our previous announcement was not
clear enough. Contributed presentations do not need to
cover the full spectrum from genotype to phenotype. We
encourage contributions covering various individual as-
pects of the topic. - You are working on the phenotypic
end of the spectrum? Great! - You gathered exciting
data about genotypic variation? Excellent! - You are
interested predominantly in developmental biology or
in computational or theoretical approaches? We want
you!
Therefore, if you work on any of the above-mentioned
aspects and/or combinations of those please submit your
abstract until Feb 20. Contributions from all academic
levels are welcome (grad students, postdocs, PIs). If
you registered already, just re-register incl. the abstract
information.

Prague ESEB ColourVariation
Aug14-19
Abstract submission is now open for our ESEB 2022 sym-
posium, S14 \Ecological drivers and evolutionary con-
sequences of within-population colour variation". The
meeting will be held in Prague, Czech Republic on Au-
gust 14-19, 2022 (https://www.eseb2022.cz/ ).Symposium description: Colours of wild owers and
animals are the most conspicuous and highly diverse
traits in nature. While many plant and animal species
are colour-uniform, some species exhibit remarkable
within-population colour variation, either in the form
of discrete morphs (polymorphic species) or continuous
variation. Phenotypic selection is expected to operate on
such colour monomorphism, and investigating the mech-
anisms that counteract the eroding eect of genetic drift
that can lead to the loss of morphs can provide a deeper
understanding of how diversity is maintained. Most evi-
dence in plants suggests that within-population colour
variation is maintained by balancing selection, mediated
by multiple selection regimes, often from pollinators. In
animals, sexual selection and predation may be a com-
mon and widespread mechanisms maintaining colour
polymorphisms. Some evidence suggests that frequency-
dependent selection can maintain colour polymorphisms,
but this mechanism has only been demonstrated in a
few systems. Colour variation is also inuenced by other
evolutionary processes than selection, including genetic
drift and mutation and demographic processes, and
colour can be genetically correlated with other traits
that are targets of selection. However, most of these
mechanisms and their balance with selection have not
been subject to rigorous empirical tests. In this sympo-
sium we aim to address the drivers of within-population
colour variation, and the mechanisms that either main-
tain such variation or erode it. Among-population and
among-species variation are well studied and discussed
in past ESEB meetings. Colour variation within pop-
ulations, however, has gotten less attention. We will
bring together botanists and zoologists, theoreticians
and empiricists, to explore the evolutionary dynamics of
such colour polymorphisms. We plan to discuss topics
ranging from sexual selection and signalling to aposema-
tism and deception, with the overall aim to understand
the eco-evolutionary dynamics of such polymorphisms.
Potentially, the symposium will provide a baseline to
a unied theory of colour evolution, and will identify
new prospective directions for future research that will
advance our understanding of polymorphic variation
in nature. In addition, we will propose to publish the
symposium as a special issue in Journal of Evolutionary
Biology.
The two keynote speakers for the session are Dr. Karin
Kjernsmo (University of Bristol, UK) and Dr. Nathalie
Feiner (Lund University, Sweden).
We especially encourage submissions from early career
researchers and from researchers from historically un-
derrepresented groups. ESEB has funding opportuni-
ties to support meeting attendance, including confer-
ence travel awards for early career researchers (https:/-March 1, 2022 EvolDir 9

DomesticationWithAncientDNA
Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
We are excited to announce our symposium titled \Do-
mestication: Fresh insights from ancient genomics" to
be held during the ESEB meeting in Prague between
August 14-19, 2022.
More information about the ESEB meeting can be found
below and at the conference website: www.eseb2022.cz
S33: Domestication: Fresh insights from ancient ge-
nomics
Animal and plant domestication events have fundamen-
tally changed human societies in multitude ways, while
biologically shaping the domesticated species themselves.
The tempo and mode of domestication processes, the
subsequent dynamics of transport, breeding and intro-
gression between domesticates and their wild relatives,
the genetic bases of selected traits, as well as the so-
cial and biological impacts of animal husbandry and
farming on humans have long been investigated, using
either archaeological evidence or inferences from biolog-
ical studies of extant species. The advent of ancient
genomics, however, has been a game changer. The last
few years have seen a wide range of spectacular workthat rewrote domestication histories of dierent species,
from dogs to chicken. This session aims to bring to-
gether the most recent and exciting work on animal and
plant domestication, covering both the reconstruction
of demographic history, analyses of selective sweeps, ev-
idence for relaxation of constraints, as well as studies
on ancient pathogens.

DynamicsOfChangingEnvironments
Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
Our ESEB 2022 symposium \Eco-evolutionary dynam-
ics in changing environments: insights from models,
experiments and case studies" (S10), is now open for
submissions (see https://www.eseb2022.cz for further
details).
Eco-evolutionary dynamics is fundamental to our under-
standing of processes that shape species' distributions
and their capacity to adapt. Notably, due to the unabat-
ing climate change, environmental conditions change at
an unprecedented speed and often exhibit higher uc-
tuations. These can increase the selective pressures on
the populations and may drive major shifts in species
composition. In this context, an improved understand-
ing of eco-evolutionary processes is not only relevant to
grasp the conditions for the maintenance of biodiversity
but is also essential to provide informed management
policies.
Necessarily, experiments and theory develop in tandem:
without theory, one does not know what to measure;
and without experiments, no theory can be corrobo-
rated and assumptions may go seriously astray. The
proposed symposium aims to foster the dialogue between
theory in evolutionary ecology and assessment of the eco-
evolutionary dynamics in both natural and experimental
evolution. The focus will be on evolution with spatial
and/or temporal variation, where eco-evolutionary pro-
cesses are especially important. For modelling contribu-
tions, it will be required that the theory is formulated
in a way which makes it in principle testable in natural
or experimental populations. Extension to coevolution
and macroecological theory are welcome.
Our two keynote speakers are Jason P. Sexton (Uni-
versity of California) and Ruth A. Hufbauer (Colorado
State University).
Abstracts can be submitted on: https://-
www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-page. Deadline
is April 15 2022.
ESEB also proposes a grant in order to ensure equal

InterplayPlasticityEvol Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
We are organising a symposium at ESEB 2022 this sum-
mer on the interplay between plasticity and evolution
during global change. Are plastic responses good enough
to cope with novel conditions? What role can evolution
play if plasticity is (mal)adaptive?
We invited two excellent people who tackle these ques-
tions, Anne Charmantier and Ryan Martin, to speak in
our session.
We encourage everyone interested in this topic to submit
their abstract.
S20. Unravelling the interplay between plasticity and
evolution during rapid global change
Following the accumulating evidence showing that ongo-
ing rapid global change is forcing many species to cope
with new conditions, a pressing question emerges: what
mechanisms underlie responses to these novel conditions?
Moreover, what are the respective contributions of evo-
lution and plasticity in facilitating species' persistence?
How does the interaction between plasticity and evolu-
tion shape responses to novel conditions? Phenotypic
plasticity can be a rapid type of response for coping with
global change, yet may be insucient to protect species
from extinction. Evolution may play an important role
by reinforcing adaptive plastic responses, or opposing
maladaptive plastic responses. Indeed, adaptive plastic-
ity can increase relative tness which can eventually lead
to canalization of the plastic response through evolution.
It is however not known how developmental mechanisms
inuence this process, and whether some types of traits
are more likely to experience this. Only in recent yearsMarch 1, 2022 EvolDir 11
the interplay between maladaptive plasticity and evolu-
tion has gained more attention, despite the expectation
that these responses are under stronger directional se-
lection than adaptive plastic responses. Critical gaps
remain on the relative role of the various ways evolution
can interact with dierent types of plasticity, and how
these inuence the rate of response to global change.
Registration is open.

RapidEvolutionOfColorPatterns
Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
We are happy to announce that abstract submission for
our symposium S15 \Rapid evolution of color patterns"
at the ESEB 2022 conference is now open.
The symposium will be held at the Congress of the Euro-
pean Society for Evolutionary Biology in Prague, 14-19
August 2022 (https://www.eseb2022.cz/ ). Abstract
Animal and plant color patterns are labile characters
that are involved in important biological functions such
as reproduction, predator evasion, pollinator attraction,
and thermoregulation. A fascinating feature of color
variation is that it can evolve rapidly in new environ-
ments, as highlighted by dramatic examples in peppered
moths, cichlid shes, and *Heliconius* butteries.
Beyond these classic cases, technological advances in
high-throughput sequencing, phenotyping, and gene edit-
ing, have opened new pathways to study rapid evolution
using color patterns in a diversity of models. Among
other examples, recent studies have highlighted the roleof transposable elements in bualo coat coloration, chro-
mosome re-arrangement in buttery wing patterns, and
trans-generational plasticity in ower coloration in re-
sponse to predation. This symposium will assemble
researchers who use animal and plant color patterns as
models to evaluate the diversity of factors driving and
constraining rapid phenotypic evolution. We will foster
transdisciplinary discussions addressing long-standing
questions on the genetic substrate of recurrent adap-
tation and the mechanistic scale of convergence. Ulti-
mately, we hope to gain a more comprehensive under-
standing of the mechanisms underlying rapid adapta-
tion.

Dear EvolDir Colleagues,|
We are organizing a symposium at the Congress of the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology, in Prague

cuss the integration of eco-evo concepts in biological

SYMPOSIUM 19: **ECO-EVOLUTIONARY DYNAM-
ICS AND FEEDBACKS IN INVASIVE SPECIES**
Introduced alien species are remarkable in their unusual
ability to experience rapid evolutionary and ecological
changes on relatively short time scales following their
introductions to novel ranges. As a result, biological
invasions oer valuable insights into processes that con-
tribute to our understanding of population responses
to climate change, ecosystem function, extinction and
diversication events, with implications for species man-
agement and conservation. While a rich literature ex-
ists on the ecology and evolution of invasive species,
much less is known about how ecological properties
and evolutionary changes inuence one another, namely,
the so-called \eco-evolutionary dynamics" and \eco-
evolutionary feedbacks". Thus, this symposium aims
to discuss the innovative integration of concepts from
these two elds into the study of invasion biology. In
particular, we welcome studies that focus on topics such
as interactions between genome architecture and envi-
ronmental change, adaptive traits and their ecological
consequences, post-introduction evolution, feedbacks
between organisms and resource dynamics, eects of
evolution of dispersal on range expansions, and the
interplay between theoretical population genetics and
ecological demography. In addition, talks could focus
on evolutionary diversication, niche displacement or
extinction of resident species induced by invaders. We
also encourage studies on ecological genomics that could
be applied to non-model invasive populations.

YosemiteNatlPark Symbiosis
May13-15
PLEASE SAVE THE DATE MORE DETAILS SOON
Dear Colleagues,
After a two-year absence, The TENTH annual Yosemite
Symbiosis Workshop will take place on May 13th-15th,
2022 at the Sierra Nevada Research Institute, Yosemite
National Park. We have really missed having this meet-
ing over the last two years. In the previous nine years,
this meeting became a great venue for a diversity of
symbiosis researchers. We hope to continue to attract a
diverse group in 2022!
Keynote speaker 2022: Michelle Nishiguchi, UC Merced
COVID19 Safety:
Attendees will be required to provide proof of full vacci-
nation status against SARS-CoV2 during the registra-
tion process.
Rapid antigen tests will be made upon arrival at the
conference (provided by us) to provide an extra layer of
safety for attendees
The meeting will occur indoors, and masks will be re-
quired during meeting sessions when the opportunity
for social distancing will be limited.
Meals, and coee/snack breaks will be provided outside
weather permitting. Temperatures in mid-May are usu-
ally mild, but there is always some chance that it will
be cold and or rainy during the meeting.
Information about our meeting:
Why attend?
Our continuing goal is to better integrate the broad
groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis research.
Yosemite serves as an ideal site as it is both beautiful
and secluded. This will be our 10th annual meeting and
we have been consistently attracting scientists from all
over the country and overseas.March 1, 2022 EvolDir 17
Who will be there?
The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants) and
we seek to focus on scientists interested in cooperation,
mutualism, and symbiosis. In the past we have covered
a range of symbiosis topics from ecology and evolution
to molecular mechanisms in dierent model and non-
model systems. We would like to make room for a
diverse group of people so we will initially accept up to
3 lab members per group (including the PI) on a rst
come rst served basis.
When is the meeting?
The talks and formal meeting will be held May 14th and
15th, 2022, though we make accommodation arrange-
ments available for attendees to arrive on Friday the
13th to provide opportunities to enjoy the park. There
will be a welcome party on the evening of arrival, Friday
May 13th. Since time at the conference is limited, we
ask attendees to submit an abstract and a preference
(talk versus poster). Priority will be given to those pre-
senting. Abstract and early bird registration will be due
on March 1st, 2022.Where is the meeting?
This is the best part! The meeting takes place at the
Sierra Nevada Research Station, in Wawona California,
within the border of Yosemite National Park!
What will it cost?
We will provide details on the registration page soon.
We keep costs to a minimum, and so prices will be very
reasonable. We will only be able to accept credit card
payments this year.

We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to be
part of a group to investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the reproduction of the Australasian snapper
(Chrysophrys auratus).

Wellenreuther, Auckland University and Plant
and Food Research (PFR), Nelson, New Zealand.https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/people/prole/-
m-wellenreuther 2. Co-supervisor: Craig Radford,
Auckland University, New Zealand
3. Advisor: Dr Dafni Anastasiadi (PFR), Plant and
Food Research (PFR), Nelson, New Zealand.
4. Advisor: Dr Matthew Wylie (PFR), Plant and Food
Research (PFR), Nelson, New Zealand.
Background Aquaculture is the fastest growing food-
production sector and New Zealand has the potential
to develop a range of locally grown nsh species to
meet this increasing demand. Plant and Food Research
(http://www.plantandfood.co.nz) is known worldwide
for its innovative breeding and genomics research, and
it is leading the development of New Zealand seafood
genomics. Understanding and controlling the repro-
ductive development of sh in captivity is critical for
the establishment of new aquaculture species and the
production of high quality seed. From gonadal dier-
entiation to gametogenesis and spawning, reproduction
is regulated by external and internal cues that trigger
nely tuned molecular networks. Expression of key genes
associated with reproduction respond to the endocrine
regulation of the brain-pituitary-gonad axis. Further-
more, epigenetic mechanisms can mediate changes in
gene expression since they are inducible by external
cues. This PhD project will involve working alongside a
group of experienced researchers to study the molecular
mechanisms involved in the reproductive development
of cultured Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys aura-
tus), using molecular, transcriptomic and epigenomic
approaches, and their association with reproductive phe-
notypes. The PhD student will gain experience working
with collaborators from New Zealand (Mark Lokman,
University of Otago), Australia (Abigail Elizur), Spain
(Francesc Piferrer) and Greece (Elena Sarropoulou).
PhD Project Aims 1. Describe the reproductive phys-
iology of snapper in captivity to provide a basis for
photoperiod manipulations and the appropriate tim-
ing for hormone-induced spawning. 2. Investigate the
role of epigenomic patterns, including DNA methyla-
tion and non-coding RNAs, in regulating gametogenesis.
3. Investigate the DNA methylation patterns in go-
nad development in this protogynous hermaphroditic
species.
This PhD project will provide an excellent opportunity
to learn the latest interdisciplinary technologies and
apply them to better understand reproduction and sh
(epi)genomics. The PhD student will gain experience
working in academic and government institutions. They
will be a member of a highly active and collaborative
group of researchers, and help develop new technological
approaches and applied-genomic tools.March 1, 2022 EvolDir 19
The Candidate and how to Apply The successful can-
didate will be a highly motivated researcher with a
strong background in laboratory techniques and com-
putational approaches. Molecular laboratory work and
data analysis of next generation sequencing data will be
the main workload of the project. Therefore, knowledge
and experience of a scripting language (Python/Perl)
is benecial. A proven ability and motivation to write
research papers is essential.
Students will be enrolled at the University of
Auckland but primarily based in Nelson (http://-
www.nelsonnz.com). We will provide a three-year schol-
arship that provides a stipend and university (domestic-
level) fees.
Applicants should send a CV, contact details of two
academic referees and a cover letter that states why
you are interested in the position and how your qual-
ications and experience make you a good t for the
proposed research. Send these to Maren Wellenreuther
(Maren.Wellenreuther@plantandfood.co.nz). Candidate
selection will begin in July, but applications will be
considered until the position is lled. The ideal starting
date is 1 June/July 2022. New Zealand applicants with
strong academic record are encouraged to apply.

BielefeldU FungalGenomicAnalysis
3-year PhD position: Genomic analysis of dispersal and
adaptation in porcini mushroomsWith Prof Joe Homan (Bielefeld University, Germany)
together with collaboration partners Prof. Bill Amos
(Cambridge University), Dr. Kanchon Dasmahapatra
(University of York, UK), Prof. Bryn Dentinger (Univer-
sity of Utah, USA), Prof. Thorunn Helgason (University
of York, UK), Dr. Minou Nowrousian (Ruhr-Universit at
Bochum, Germany), Dr. Ulrike Damm (Senckenberg
Museum of Natural History, G orlitz, Germany) and
Dr. Fernando Mart nez Pe na (Agri-food Research and
Technology Center of Aragon, Spain).
An outstanding opportunity is available for a PhD stu-
dent to work on the evolutionary genomics of porcini
mushrooms. The position is available in Joe Homan's
research group (www.thehomanlab.com) at the Depart-
ment of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University and
is fully funded for three years. It will combine eldwork
in Germany, the UK, France and Spain with lab-based
bioinformatic analysis of next generation sequencing
data.
The project: Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are critical
components of terrestrial ecosystems that play essential
roles in nutrient recycling. Consequently, there is a
pressing need to study their population dynamics and
life histories so as to better understand how ecosys-
tems function and persist. In particular, we need to
learn how EMF disperse, colonise new habitats, adapt
to their hosts and, in the longer term, speciate. This
project will focus on the iconic edible mushroom, Bole-
tus edulis, known variously as the penny bun, c epe de
Bordeaux, porcino or Steinpilz. It will exploit a large
collection of B. edulis samples to deliver arguably the
most comprehensive population genomic study of any
wild fungus. Systematic repeated sampling of multiple
woodland patches from Bielefeld (Germany) and Thet-
ford Forest (UK) will be used to investigate ne-scale
patterns of dispersal, population structure and adapta-
tion to dierent tree hosts. Overall, this project will
produce a detailed picture of how EMF populations
become established, spread and evolve. Understand-
ing these processes is essential for predicting ecosystem
responses to climate change.
The applicant: We seek a bright and highly motivated
student who holds a good rst degree and an M.Sc. or
equivalent in a relevant topic (e.g. molecular ecology,
fungal biology, population genomics, bioinformatics).
The ideal candidate will have strong quantitative skills,
including prociency in working in R and writing cus-
tom scripts. Practical experience of working with next
generation sequence data would be advantageous, but
full training will be provided. The candidate should also
be able to work both independently and as part of a
multidisciplinary team. A high standard of spoken and
written English is required.20 EvolDir March 1, 2022
The working environment: The PhD student will be
based at the Department of Animal Behaviour at
Bielefeld University, Germany (www.uni-bielefeld.de/-
biologie/vhf/index.html). The department is the oldest
of its kind in Germany and currently hosts seven princi-
pal investigators, nine postdocs and 15 PhD students.
It oers a stimulating, supportive and highly interna-
tional environment as well as an excellent research in-
frastructure. The working language of the Department
is English.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with an attrac-
tive historical centre and easy access to the Teutoberger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It is an af-
fordable and pleasant city to live in and is well connected
to most major European cities.
The PhD student will be based at Bielefeld University
but will have ample opportunities to interact with the
international collaboration partners, who bring addi-
tional expertise in molecular ecology (Bill Amos), speci-
ation genomics (Kanchon Dasmahapatra), fungal biol-
ogy (Bryn Dentinger), plant-fungal interactions (Tho-
runn Helgason), fungal mating system evolution (Minou
Nowrousian), fungal systematics (Ulrike Damm) and
mycological conservation (Fernando Mart nez Pe na).
The successful applicant will therefore benet from an
integrative, multidisciplinary training that will prepare
her/him very well for a scientic career in molecular
ecology / fungal biology / population genomics / con-
servation biology.
Remuneration: This generous PhD studentship is
funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) for
a period of three years and includes health insurance.
The pay scale is TVL E13 (65%). Funding will also
be available for travel and for the student to attend
workshops and conferences.
Application procedure: To apply for this position, please
provide: (i) a letter of motivation including a maximum
2-page statement of your research interests, relevant
skills and experience; (ii) a CV including publication
list; (iii) names and contact details of two referees willing

polyploid formation and establishment, and it alleviates
the initial meiotic shock by restoring fertility in nascent
polyploids, providing novel opportunities for polyploid
adaptation and expansion. This project about the role
of temperature in the origin and evolutionary success of
polyploids will be done in close collaboration with the
group of Polina Novikova at the Max Planck Institute
for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany,

Previous experience in these elds is benecial but not
strictly required. Excellent communication skills are
required for this position, as the candidate will become
part of an international team and international collabo-

GrasslandPlantEvolution
We are seeking postdoctoral and graduate student ap-
plicants from diverse backgrounds to participate in a
fully funded working group focusing on exploring the
role of evolutionary processes in long-term ecological re-
search, with an emphasis on grassland plants. The aim
of this working group is to facilitate collaborations be-
tween ecologists and evolutionary biologists by realizing
the opportunity that Long-Term Ecological Research
(LTER) sites provide for conducting eco-evolutionary
research.
Biologists increasingly recognize that ecological and
evolutionary processes are closely linked. This is partic-
ularly relevant in the context of global change, where en-
vironmental conditions may change rapidly, and species
may adapt to the novel conditions in a comparable
timeframe. Unfortunately, studies that examine the in-
teractions and feedback loops between evolutionary and
ecological processes, particularly in long-term ecological
studies, are rare. The working group will address thisproblem by rst identifying barriers that exist to de-
veloping evolutionary biology work at LTER sites and,
second, identifying possible solutions. In doing so, the
working group will develop a framework for how to best
implement future eco-evolutionary research in a long-
term ecological research context. Lastly, the main goal
of this working group is to unite early-career ecologists
and evolutionary biologists with postdoc and gradu-
ate students to create a new cohort of eco-evolutionary
scientists!
The working group will be held at Sevilleta
National Wildlife Refuge LTER <https://-
unmsevilletaeldstation.wordpress.com/ >in La
Joya, NM on May 9th-12th, 2022. We expect partici-
pants will arrive Sunday night (May 8th) and depart
Friday morning (May 13th). Travel to/from and
accommodation at the UNM Sevilleta Field Station
will be provided, and all meals will be catered for
the duration of the working group. There will be no
costs for participants. The format will be a daily
morning plenary, followed by break-out focus groups,
evening graduate and postdoc posters, and informal
discussion. Please be aware that we will be abiding by
CDC guidelines and requiring proof of vaccination to
attend in-person. Remote participation will also be
available to those who cannot or do not feel comfortable
attending in-person. Our goal is to hold a productive
meeting where all feel safe and comfortable - as such,
we will be monitoring the ever-changing situation and
making changes when necessary!
The organizers of the working group greatly value diver-
sity, equality of opportunity, and human dignity. Sci-
entists who are LGBTQ+, Black, Hispanic, Latin(o/a),
Indigenous, Asian, Asian American, Pacic Islander,
two or more races/ethnicities, or veterans are especially
encouraged to apply. To apply, email Jenny Cocciardi
(jenny.cocciardi@jhu.edu) with the subject line \Evo-
LTER Working Group Application" with; 1) a copy of
your CV, 2) an abstract describing research that you
would like to present on at the working group (limit
300 words), and, 3) a one-page diversity, equity, and
inclusion statement describing your experiences and com-
mitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion
in STEM. The research may be in the elds spanning
ecology and evolutionary biology, but preferably with
an element of both (including, but not limited to; plant
eco-evo-devo biology, global change ecology, adaptation
to climate change, phenology, plant physiology and mor-
phology, phenotypic plasticity, quantitative genetics and
genomics, community ecology, population genetics, etc.).
Applications are due March 4th and applicants will be
notied of the decision to attend by March 14th, 2022.
Undergraduate students who have conducted research24 EvolDir March 1, 2022
that they feel ts well with the working group's main
aims may also apply. Applicants are encouraged to

| Genomics of sex chromosome evolution in African cich-
lids | The mechanisms of sex determination are diverse
despite their unifying function in dening male and fe-
male sex within a species. This project focuses on the
investigation of sex chromosomes in a model system of
evolutionary biology, the African cichlid shes, in which
we previously identied an outstandingly high rate of sex
chromosome turnover. We will here submerge deeper
into the sex chromosome history of African cichlids,
zoom into particular species with previously identied
sex chromosomes to study convergent evolution, perform
crosses and focus on the genomic signatures underlying
transitions between sex chromosomes. To understand
how sex is established and maintained at the molecular
level, we will also analyze gene expression as well as
the regulatory signatures activating and silencing gene
expression in males and females.
| Collectomics of vertebrates | High-quality genomes
are an important basis for biological and evolution-
ary research. However, generating assemblies of high
completeness and contiguity requires ideally fresh, ash-
frozen samples. The availability of such samples has
become a major limitation for biodiversity genomics,
in particular for rare or endangered species, or species
inhabiting remote regions. Museum collections house
millions of samples. Here we will use museum samples
to unlock collection treasures for genome sequencing
and analyses. This project is part of a collaboration

ModellingCooperation
The research group Dynamics of Social Behavior ex-
plores under which conditions individuals cooperate. To
this end, we translate social interactions into mathemat-
ical games. These games can then be explored analyti-
cally, with computer simulations, and with behavioral
experiments.
Our group currently consists of six members (includ-
ing two PostDocs and three PhD students), with back-
grounds in mathematics, physics, psychology, and eco-
nomics. The group members have a wide range of
competences, including mathematical modeling, game
theory, network theory, machine learning, data analysis
andcomputer programming.
We are looking for motivated researchers to join us. Our
website: http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/
. PhD Position (3 years) Mathematical modelling and
data driven analysis of cooperation in stochastic games
One key mechanism for cooperation is repetition. Peo-
ple are more likely to help somebody if they have a
chance of meeting them again. Most existing models of
repeated games assume that when a set of people inter-
act over multiple rounds, the rules of their interactions
remain constant, and are independent of the outcomes
ofprevious interactions.
The project aims to develop and analyze models of re-
peated games that capture the idea that people's actions
aect the rules of their future interactions. Furthermore,
the project aims to explore such situations using a data
driven analysis.
Applicants should have a degree in mathematics, com-
puter science, economics, physics, or another related
eld. They should be curious to describe social be-
haviors mathematically and to analyze data. Ideally,
they are already familiar with the theory of Markov
chains and stochastic processes, and have some experi-
ence inprogramming and data handling (e.g. Python,
R, Matlab, SQL, ...). Good quantitative skills will be
important.
Working environmentThe Max Planck Research Group \Dynamics of Social
Behavior" has been established in October 2019, and
is led by Dr. Christian Hilbe. The group organizes a
weekly group meeting in which the group members have
an opportunity to present their ongoing work and to dis-
cuss current research, and to invite and learn fromguest
speakers. The group has hosted several guest speakers
in the last year; all experts in the eld of social behavior
with diverse backgrounds.
The group is a part of the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Biology in Pl on, Germany. The Institute
has three departments (Evolutionary Theory, Micro-
bial Population Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and
several additional research groups. The group is well
connected to the Department for Evolutionary Theory
led by Prof.Arne Traulsen, which oers further seminars
and a weekly journal club.
In addition, the research group maintains strong collab-
orations with external researchers, including researchers
from Harvard University, IST Austria, and the Univer-
sity of Exeter.
Pl on is a small town close to the Baltic Sea, embed-
ded into a beautiful landscape with innumerous lakes.
The area provides ample opportunity for free time ac-
tivities such as swimming, canoe-ing, or biking in a
stunning environment. The cities of Kiel and L ubeck
(^ a¥200,000 inhabitants) are only half an hour train ride
away.Hamburg (Germany's second largest city) can be
reached within 1.5h by train.

BiofoulingCommunityBiodiversity
PhD Scholarship to assess the temporal and spatial com-
munity composition of marine biofouling using eDNA
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to be
part of a group investigating the temporal and spatial
community changes of biofouling using eDNA methods.
Candidates will apply phylogenetic and comparative
methods to understand community composition and
associated changes, and relate these to the wide abiotic
and biotic environment.
Project background and wider context Plant and Food
Research (PFR) is making a signicant investment in
developing the knowledge, capability and innovations
needed to undertake the aquaculture of sh at open
ocean sites around Aotearoa. Biofouling of marine struc-
tures has been identied as a hurdle to farming in the
open ocean, and a ve year programme called New
Open Ocean Ecosystems was designed and launched in
2021 to study the poorly understood topic of biofoul-
ing of aquaculture materials at exposed NZ sites. The
PhD project will form part of this research programme,
specically, the student will develop a standardised and
replicated sampling array for assessing the composition
of marine biolms. To adequately characterise com-
munity composition the student will apply optimised
DNA extraction methods to extract high quality DNA
for metabarcoding to characterize marine bacterial and
eukaryotic biofouling communities (Zaiko et al., 2016,
Pochon et al., 2015, von Ammon et al., 2018a, Briand et
al., 2018, von Ammon et al., 2018b, Zaiko et al., 2020).
Sampling will initially be undertaken at an easily acces-
sible inshore location (e.g. Beatrix Bay, Nelson Haven)
with the aim of extending these protocols to samples
from more exposed open ocean aquaculture sites, to
better understand the sources and vectors of propag-
ules and to improve management of biofouling-related
risks. Temporal and spatial variation among biolm
settlement will be assessed against the most relevant
parameters identied. Additionally ltered planktoniceDNA samples will be collected in close proximity to the
settlement arrays to examine linkages between plank-
tonic and settled communities. The opportunity to
include eRNA approaches as a proxy for the living por-
tion of the biofouling community will be considered and
discussed (Pochon et al., 2017, Wood et al., 2020).
The PhD project will incorporate a range of cutting-edge,
next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based techniques to
better understand the colonisation process on articial
surfaces and link what is present in the plankton to
what occurs in the fouling community under a range of
fouling-control conditions. The PhD student will gain
experience working in academic and government insti-
tutions. They will be a member of a highly active and
collaborative group of researchers, and help develop new
technological approaches and applied-genomic tools.
The specic PhD project aims are: (i) catalogue the
primary colonizers and their phylogenetic relationships
and document successional stages and seasonal changes,
(ii) understand the impact of the spatial location and
associated environmental factors on biolm community
composition, and (iii) compare the biolm-forming and
planktonic bacterial community.
The proposed topic leaves sucient freedom in the se-
lection of specic aspects and the design of a research
plan for the doctorate candidate.
How to apply Applicants should send a CV, contact
details of two academic referees and a cover letter
that states why you are interested in the position and
how your qualications and experience make you a
good t for the proposed research. Academic quali-
cations are considered alongside signicant relevant
non-academic experience. Send these to Maren Wellen-
reuther (Maren.Wellenreuther@plantandfood.co.nz) and
Peter Bell (Peter.Bell@plantandfood.co.nz). Applica-
tions will be considered until the position is lled. Stu-
dents will be enrolled at the University of Auckland
but be based in Nelson (http://www.nelsonnz.com/).
We will provide a three-year scholarship that provides a

Two PhD positions in Theoretical Ecology and Evolu-
tion
Two funded, 4-year PhD positions are available in the
Division of Theoretical Ecology and Evolution (https:/-
/banklab.github.io/) led by Professor Claudia Bank at
the University of Bern, Switzerland. The positions are
part of the ERC project \FIT2GO - a toolbox for tness
landscapes in evolution", in which we study adaptation
and speciation from a tness-landscape point of view.
The specic PhD projects will be developed individu-
ally and should broadly address some of the following
questions (see also this review paper from the lab: Fra-
gata et al., 2019, TrEE, https://www.dropbox.com/s/-
wiy9doprw3nhoe2/tree ms.pdf?dl=0):
1. How do tness landscapes vary across environments,
and how does that aect adaptation?
2. What is the role of epistasis (i.e., the interaction of
mutations for tness) during speciation?
3. How much information on epistasis and past environ-
mental change is maintained in genomes, and how can
we extract this information?
4. Which signature do dierent evolutionary processes
leave in genomic data?
5. How do ecology and evolution interact to shape
populations and communities?
Depending on the overarching fundamental question,
the projects might relate to applied problems, such as
the predictability or repeatability of (drug resistance)
evolution, or the probability of populations to adapt or
persist in the face of the climate crisis.
Both projects will be theoretical in nature and can in-
volve mathematical modeling, computer simulations,
and/or statistical method development and data anal-
ysis. If it strengthens the project and if the student is
interested, a (minor) experimental or eld-work compo-
nent can be included via our empirical collaborators.
Your prole
Candidates must be highly motivated, creative, and able
to work independently and collaboratively. Applications
from diverse scientic backgrounds (e.g., from physics,
mathematics, statistics, computer science, biology) areencouraged. In their motivation letter, applicants from
outside biology should state why they are interested in
the study of ecology and evolution, and applicants from
biology should state why they are interested in joining a
theoretical research group. Candidates must have excel-
lent written and spoken communication skills in English,
which is the working language of our institute. A Master
degree is required. This position is open to applicants
worldwide. We are committed to increasing diversity,
equity and inclusiveness in ecology and evolution and
especially encourage applications from underrepresented
groups.
Work environment
The Division of Theoretical Ecology and Evolution is
a dynamic, international, and interdisciplinary group.
Current and former group members include trained bi-
ologists, physicists, mathematicians, bioinformaticians,
anthropologists, and biochemists. As supporters of the
Better Science Initiative (https://betterscience.ch/en/),
our lab philosophy includes open and compassionate
communication, regular individual meetings and evalu-
ation of mentoring and career development needs, and
prioritization of the well-being of all lab members. Our
group is part of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution
at the University of Bern (https://www.iee.unibe.ch/);
we are also members of the Bern Data Science Initiative
(https://www.bedsi.unibe.ch/) and the Swiss Institute
of Bioinformatics (https://www.sib.swiss/). Through
these structures, the PhD students will have ample op-
portunities for interactions and collaborations across
research elds with a vibrant international community
of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and pro-
fessors. The University of Bern is situated near the
heart of the beautiful old city, and the quality of life in
Bern is very high, with the Swiss alps in close vicinity.
The starting date of the PhD positions is negotiable
(ideally in fall 2022). The starting salary is 47,040 CHF
and includes social security contributions.

Location:
Psychology, Streatham Campus, Exeter
The University of Exeter's College of Life and Envi-
ronmental Sciences, in partnership with Reneco Inter-
national Wildlife Consultants, is inviting applications
for a PhD studentship to commence in March 2022 or
as soon as possible thereafter. The studentship is to
investigate personality traits and cognitive abilities in
a captive-bred population of North African houbara
bustards (Chlamydotis undulata undulata).
Project Description: The endangered North African
houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata) has
been declining drastically throughout its range due to
overhunting and habitat degradation. Since the late 90s
the species has been the subject of a large-scale captive
breeding programme at the Emirates Center for Wildlife
Propagation, Missour, with more than 15 000 birds pro-
duced annually for release in the wild. The intention of
this rearing and release is to restore wild populations
and supplement hunting grounds for regulated falconry
(http://www.houbarafund.org). Houbaras are bred us-
ing an articial insemination process following a strict
genetic management (pedigree-based), designed to in-
crease genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding depression
(Rabier et al. 2020, 2021). However, past research
(Charge et al. 2013, 2014) and ongoing analyses (E
Sorato) have provided evidence for among-individual dif-
ferences in sexual behaviour and life history traits partly
associated with origin (captive-bred vs wild-origin indi-
viduals), which may arise through genetic adaptation to
captivity and parental eects.. Still, the relative extent
to which genetic changes and environmental eects may
aect personality, cognitive traits, and ultimately tness
in the wild, remains to be explored.
The successful applicant will investigate the eects ofMarch 1, 2022 EvolDir 31
captive-breeding on personality traits, by conducting
behavioural tests on captive houbaras throughout on-
togeny. Interplays between personality and individual
cognitive abilities (discriminative and reversal learning)
will also be explored. By testing individuals with vary-
ing known histories of captive breeding, and by using
quantitative genetics statistical methods, we will assess
the extent of adaptation to captivity and disentangle
the relative impact of additive genetic, parental and
environmental eects on the main personality axes, and
on interplays between personality and cognitive traits.
This study will contribute to unravel the selection forces
shaping variation in personality and cognitive traits and
will ultimately aid improve conservation breeding of
endangered species / houbara bustards.

Dear All
Through project LIFEPLAN (https://www2.helsinki./-
en/projects/lifeplan), we are looking for a PhD student
to work on Phylogenetic community ecology.
LIFEPLAN generates standardized community-level
data across all continents over multiple years. Focusing
on insects, the PhD student will use data generated by
imaging, DNA barcoding and metabarcoding to explore
the structure of species assemblages. By generating a
phylogenetic framework for these communities, and by
extracting information on body size, the PhD student
will investigate community structure in terms of species
diversity, phylogenetic diversity and trait disparity. The
use and development of bioinformatics tools able to
handle large datasets, in particular for generating phy-
logenetic information, will be an important part of the
project.
The successful candidate will be integrated in the LIFE-
PLAN group, an international network of some hundred
researchers from the elds of community ecology, math-
ematical modeling, articial intelligence and metabar-
coding. At the Department of Ecology of the Swedish
University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU, Uppsala), the
PhD student will join a research group with strong
expertise in community ecology, ecological interaction
networks, biogeography and insect phylogenetics.

EvolutionMultipleSclerosisRisk
PhD position to study the evolution of multiple sclerosis
risk at the University of Tasmania (UTAS), in Hobart,
Australia
We are seeking a PhD candidate to study the impact
of natural selection on the genetic risk of developing
multiple sclerosis.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence shows a heteroge-
neous geographical pattern, with higher prevalence in
populations of European ancestry, increasing with dis-
tance from the equator within those populations. Thispattern has likely been shaped in part by natural selec-
tion. Identifying genes that have undergone selection
at MS risk loci will improve our understanding of the
causative mechanisms behind the disease. This project
will use population genomics to identify functional vari-
ation under natural selection at loci associated with MS
risk.
You will use cutting-edge bioinformatic methods to carry
out genome-wide scans for natural selection in popula-
tion genomic data, and localise MS-related selection by
targeting loci known to be associated with MS risk. You
will also use a landscape genomics approach to examine
the evolutionary causes of the strong latitude gradient
in MS prevalence that is observed in some populations.
You will use haplotype analysis to test whether specic
haplotypes at loci under selection are associated with
MS, providing a more detailed picture of the genetic ar-
chitecture that contributes to risk than we can generate
considering only individual variants. This project is pri-
marily computational, but may also include a laboratory
component to validate ndings by targeted sequencing
in a cohort of MS patients and controls.
The selected candidate will need to apply to the upcom-
ing scholarship round at UTAS. Details can be found at
the UTAS website below:
https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-
projects/accordion-projects/health-and-medicine/-
area/menzies-institute-of-medical-research/the-
evolution-of-multiple-sclerosis-risk Selection criteria:
1. Strong academic record, including a Bachelor
degree with Honours or Masters from a recognised
institution. 2. Strong quantitative skills, ideally
including competence with R. 3. English language
uency. 4. Experience in either bioinformatics or
population biology.

Gotland Sweden FieldAssist
HoleNestingBirds
Swedish ycatchers and blue tits from the beautiful
and mysterious island of Gotland are again calling for
new eldwork enthusiasts! We are looking for at least 3
motivated eld assistants, to join our team for the 2022
spring season on Gotland. You will become a member
of our large team (up to 10-12 people in total), working
on Gotland from the approx. half of April (start around
April 20th) until the end of June. Exact times spent
in the eld may vary and we are exible about arrival
and departure dates - but assistants able to cover larger
periods of the eld season will be preferred.
Currently on Gotland we run three projects, all coordi-
nated by the Jagiellonian University in Krakow (Poland),
with close collaboration of the Uppsala University (Swe-
den), all using the local blue tit and collared ycatcher
populations. Our research is part of a continued moni-
toring eort that has been going on Gotland since the
1980's. The current projects are concerned with: (i)
the impacts of ambient temperature on life-history pa-
rameters of parents and ospring; (ii) the inuence of
articial light at night on circadian rythms and physiol-
ogy of birds|and (iii) the quantitative genetic patterns
in variation of bird microbiomes. In all cases assistants
will have to be ready for long working hours in varying
weather conditions - although specic work times vary
greatly depending on the stage of breeding season, with
periods of busy work mixed with periods of relatively
little activity.
Fieldwork on Gotland typically involves: visiting study
plots on daily basis to monitor the progress of all breed-
ing attempts, helping in two main experiments that
currently take place in the population (the heating and
the lighting experiments - each requiring dierent tasks),
measuring the birds on specic occasions, blood sam-
pling selected individuals, and some logistic tasks such
as xing nest boxes or cleaning edged nests.42 EvolDir March 1, 2022
You will be housed with the rest of the team in one
of the houses we rent for the whole breeding season -
the house is quite comfortable and has all necessary
amenities. We will also cover most or all travel costs
(depending on your departure location) and living costs
(accommodation and food).
What do we require? - good organisation and atten-
tion to details - we pay great attention to precision
in data collection, its quality and correctness; - good
interpersonal skills - you have to be able to work in a
team, share work if needed and communicate eectively
(English is our working language during work); - expe-
rience with handling wild birds, ringing, mist-netting,
morphological measurements and/or blood sampling
is not required (we can teach you this on site) but
highly recommended and candidates having such skills
are always very welcome; - ideally - having an EU (or
EU-compatible) driving license.
If you are interested and would like to apply
to join the team this year please send your CV
and contacts to 2 potential reference providers to|
szymek.drobniak@uj.edu.pl|by March 15th. In your
application please also state: what is the preferred pe-
riod you would like to come (or whether you have no
preference, meaning you could join us for most/all of
the season) and where are you based (in terms of from
where you would travel to Gotland if accepted; due to
national and institutional COVID-19 restrictions travel
form certain locations may be more dicult to accom-
modate than form others). In case of any questions -
please do not hesitate to contact us. After the closing
date we may choose to contact only selected applicants.

Hi Folks,
A reviewer has asked me and my PhD student to add a
BioGeoBEARS analysis to a manuscript before resub-
mission. The editor has only given us 3 weeks to make
revisions, and the publication only permits 2 rounds of
review. If we don't get this right, the manuscript will
be tossed.
We don't have prior experience with this software and
we can't nd a local BioGeoBEARS user to help us
get started. Is there anyone out there with familiarity
with BioGeoBEARS who also has some time to virtually
coach a student (who already knows R) through the
early part of the learning curve?

EcologyLetters SpecialIssue
Announcement Special Issue Ecology Letters
Exploring the border between ecology and evolution
Object: Special issue of Ecology Letters \Exploring the
border between ecology and evolution"
Dear colleagues,
Ecology Letters and INEE CNRS are happy to announce
that Ecology Letters will publish a special issue entitled
\Exploring the border between ecology and evolution"
for the 25th anniversary of the journal. This special
should be delivered by the end of 2022 or beginning of
2023.
The special issue is motivated by the need to develop
deeper links between ecology and evolution. This call
is not new, as shown particularly in conceptual and
epistemological work. However, its importance has been
rearmed since the early 2000s and we have seen a
gradual rise in research explicitly blending the two per-
spectives. Numerous (non-exhaustive) reasons can be
invoked: the recognition that evolutionary processes
can occur at similarly short time-scales as ecological
processes; the fact that all spatial scales are relevant in
both disciplines; convergence on using a variety of ana-
lytical methods (e.g., omics, imaging); analogous forces
acting upon various levels of biodiversity; and the holo-
biont concept linking microbial and larger organisms.
However, integrative approaches coupling ecological and
evolutionary dynamics through analyses of reciprocal
feedbacks remain rare compared to mainstream research
in either eld, calling for new research, ideas and per-
spectives. Fostering an integrative approach appears
to be particularly relevant in times of marked environ-
mental change and biodiversity loss at the planetary
scale, which strongly aects multiple dimensions of both
ecological and evolutionary dynamics, with repercus-
sions for the resilience, conservation and management
of populations, communities and ecosystems.
Based on this nding, the objectives of this special issue
are (i) to advance the conceptual bases of coupled ecolog-
ical and evolutionary dynamics, (ii) to present original
ndings from both empirical and theoretical studies, and
(iii) to explore innovative research directions for the fu-
ture. We particularly welcome papers that propose new
ideas and approaches to deepening integration, reecton concepts and semantics, including epistemological
and other philosophical perspectives, address the issue
of temporal and spatial scales, and consider responses
to global change (e.g., adaptation vs. range or com-
munity shifts), specic taxa (e.g., are micro-organisms
dierent?), and eco-evolutionary dynamics in particular
settings (e.g., urban or Arctic environments).
If you are interested in contributing a Synthesis, Perspec-
tives, Letters, Viewpoints, Methods paper that addresses
linkages between ecology and evolution, please send a let-
ter of interest to St ephane Hello (ecolets2@cefe.cnrs.fr)
by March 15 2022. Letters should be less than a page
and outline the basic ideas of your intended contribu-
tion. They will serve to explore the interest of the
scientic community in the special issue, and as a basis
to commission selected papers, including suggestions to
prospective authors to cover related or complementary
topics or to combine proposals. However, since the call
for papers is open, proposals by authors not explicitly
invited to submit a full paper and/or who did not send
a letter of interest, will equally be welcome to submit a
paper. Importantly, all papers, whether commissioned
or not, will undergo the normal review process of EL.
Manuscripts to be considered should be received by early
September 2022.

Hemimetabolous Insect Survey
Dear Colleagues,
I'm writing to ask for your help in developing new
functional genetic tools to improve the study of
hemimetabolous insects.
I am planning to invest some of my lab's resources
towards this eort in the coming years, and I would
like to choose insects for study that will be of greatest
practical use to as many scientists as possible. To that
end, I would like to invite as many members of the
international entomological community as possible, to
provide their feedback and suggestions on which species
we should choose.
I have composed a short survey to gather this infor-
mation from anyone who would like to volunteer their
input:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TRFVVLX I would
welcome your feedback and would also ask you to please
circulate the link to this survey to your network of in-

would also be happy to send it to suggested colleagues
directly, if you would prefer to send me their names and
contact emails.
Many thanks for your help, and for your leadership in

Internship Austria UGlasgow
FieldworkVolunteers SpringSummer
Field assistant volunteers/interns needed - Field study
of the Eurasian common lizard
Research interns are needed to assist in an ongoing study
of reproductive modes of the Eurasian common lizard,
Zootoca vivipara. Z. vivipara is a small insectivorous
lizard with a broad palearctic distribution, with both
oviparous and viviparous lineages extant in its European
heartland.
We study the ecology, behaviour and evolution of this
fascinating species using a unique natural experiment
site based in southern Austria. The project is organ-
ised by a team of researchers based at the University of
Glasgow (UK) led by Professor Kathryn Elmer at the In-
stitute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative
Medicine.
Internships will run from approximately late April to
late July/early August 2022.
Duties will include assisting in all aspects of eldwork at
the site, including but not limited to collection of wild
lizards by hand, recording and measurement, care and
husbandry, assisting with experiments, and contributing
to communal camping/ household tasks. Training will
be provided. There may also be opportunity for leading
or contributing to your own project within the team.
Fieldwork is physically demanding and will take place
outdoors in a remote rural location, with eldworkers
based at a commercial campsite for the duration. Interns
must be comfortable with living and working collabo-
ratively with others in a small group and long-term
camping; maintaining good relations with the team and
local community is essential.
All main expenses (food, camping/accommodation fees,
etc) and travel costs for arrival and departure will be
covered (up to ~400). More details available upon re-
quest. Interns must provide their own tent, bedding, and
outdoor clothing/personal equipment. We can welcome
team members from anywhere in the world!
Qualications: We are seeking interns with an inter-
est in herpetology, ecology and/or evolution and who62 EvolDir March 1, 2022
are very keen for gaining experience in the eld. Good
interpersonal and team working skills are essential, as
interns will be living and working with the eld team
in close quarters for an extended period. Additionally,
applicants must be physically able and willing to work
outdoors in challenging conditions (including inclement
weather and traversing steep or boggy terrain). Prior
experience of eldwork and/or working with lizards and
other herpetofauna is ideal, but not essential. We would

PaidInternships 2
EvolutionaryGenetics
Two paid scientic internships in evolutionary and eco-
logical genetics
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Sci-
ence and Technology (IST) Austria (https://-
bartongroup.pages.ist.ac.at/) is currently recruiting
two paid scientic interns to assist with a long-term
study of plant speciation in the common snapdragon,
Antirrhinum majus. The positions will begin in
early-mid May 2022, for a minimum of 6 months and
up to 12 months (open to discussion).
The project: We study evolutionary dynamics and spe-
ciation in snapdragons. The study, which has been
running since 2009, involves eldwork in natural hy-
brid zones between two subspecies with ower colour
dierences. The goal is to understand how dierent
evolutionary forces like natural selection have shaped
this diversity.
The positions: We are looking for people to help sup-
port the project by (i) participating in eldwork, (ii)
assisting with the daily management of eld volunteers,
and (iii) providing technical and scientic support after
the eldwork is complete. The internship will have 2
phases: for the rst 3 months (during the eld work),
the applicants will be based in the Spanish Pyrenees
near the town of Planoles; the second phase will be
based at the Institute of Science and Technology (IST)
Austria. All costs of the eldwork (travel, food, accom-
modation, covid testing, and insurance) are covered,
and aordable accommodation in Austria is available
through IST Austria (at the expense of the applicant).
Essential skills Applicants must be enthusiastic, hard-
working, and be comfortable working outdoors. Strong
communication skills, organization skills, and the ability
to live and work well with others are a must. A driving
license is essential.
Desirable skills Ideal applicants will have some eld-
work experience and have a strong interest in evolution,64 EvolDir March 1, 2022
ecology and/or speciation. Prior research experience,

ries organised by the ESEB-funded STN network 
Integration Of Speciation research (for more info :
[ https://speciation-network.pages.ist.ac.at ] ) will be
held on Tuesday the 8th of February 2022, 9 am CET.
This second session, of a series of three addressing the
general topic of how to bridge the gap between micro-
and macro-evolution in speciation research, will focus
on how the study of adaptive radiations can help bridge
this gap.
We will welcome as speakers Renshe Onstein (Group
leader, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Re-
search, Germany) who will talk about 'The role of
megafauna from macro- to microevolution during speci-
ation of tropical palms', and Ole Seehausen (Professor,
University of Bern and EAWAG, Switzerland) who will
talk about 'Confronting paleo-ecology, population ge-
nomics and phylogenomics in the study of cichlid sh
adaptive radiation'. The session will last 1.5 hours,
with the rst hour dedicated to the two talks and ques-
tions, and the last half-an-hour dedicated to a discussion
session.

Fieldwork volunteers wanted: Help us study plant evo-
lution in the Spanish Pyrenees!
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Sci-
ence and Technology (IST) Austria (https://-
bartongroup.pages.ist.ac.at/)is looking for volunteers to
assist with eldwork on plant speciation in the Spanish
Pyrenees this coming summer (late May - early August).
This is a great opportunity for anyone looking to obtain
experience in eldwork related to evolutionary biology,
speciation and plant ecology.
The project: We study evolutionary dynamics and spe-
ciation in snapdragons. The study, which has been
running since 2009, involves eldwork in natural hy-
brid zones between two subspecies with ower colour
dierences. The goal is to understand how dierent
evolutionary forces like natural selection have shaped
this diversity.
The eldwork: We are seeking volunteers to assist with
the eldwork, which involves working in teams to map
locations of individual plants (GPS) (the plants are pri-
marily found on the roadsides), tag and sample them for
leaves and owers, measure traits, and process material
for later DNA extraction. There may also be oppor-
tunities to be involved in other projects focusing on
pollinator behaviour and plant-insect interactions. The
work is outdoors as well as indoors - about one-third of
the of time will be spent indoors curating leaf samples
and organizing and preparing sampling equipment. The
work is highly team orientated, typically in groups of
2-3 in the eld and larger groups processing samples
back at the research station. Since we aim to sample
all living individuals in the hybrid zone during the ow-
ering season, the daily workload can vary signicantly.
At peak season, we are often very busy and our daily
routines change accordingly.
The location: The eld site is near Planoles in a beautiful
part of the Pyrenees in North Eastern Spain (Catalo-
nia). We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a
picturesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages.
The ideal applicant: is an enthusiastic, hardworking bi-
ology student with strong interest in working outdoors.
You must be meticulous with recording data and also be
comfortable working as part of a team. Experience withMarch 1, 2022 EvolDir 67
eld-based projects and plants is helpful but not essen-
tial. Climbing experience is useful as a small amount
work is conducted on ropes. We are looking for volun-
teers between the 29th May and the 1st of August. We
ask people to commit to stay for 3 weeks. Applicants
must be located in Europe or the UK.
What we cover: All food, lodgings, Covid testing and
travel within Europe/UK are covered.
How to apply? By the closing date of March 20th please
send (i) your CV, (ii) a short explanation about why you
are interested, and (iii) your availability between the
above dates to eldvolunteer2022@gmail.com. Please
send any questions to the same address.

Indies. The research is led by Professors David Reznick
(University of California, Riverside), Joseph Travis
(Florida State University), Tim Coulson (University
of Oxford), and Ron Bassar (Williams College).||We
seek to integrate multiple biological elds for the study
of these interactions in experimental populations of gup-
pies and killish in Trinidad. Duties include assisting
in monthly censuses of guppy populations in montane
streams. The monthly censuses include long hours in
the eld and laboratory.||There will also be 12 days
o between each census when interns can pursue an
independent project.
Interns will be required to spend a minimum of 3-months
in Trinidad, with possibility of extension. There are
potential start dates in March 2022 and every month
thereafter until September 2024. We will cover all|
travel and living expenses and provide housing.

the possibility of pursuing graduate studies in some
area of ecology and evolution and who wish to gain
some additional eld research experience before doing
so.||Research will take place in semi-remote areas
of Trinidad sometimes under bad weather conditions.
Applicants must be able to live and work well with oth-
ers. Research will involve carrying heavy packs over
slippery and steep terrain. Applicants must be in good
physical condition and be able to meet the demands of
eld research under these conditions. Ability to drive
a standard transmission vehicle is desirable but not
required. Applicants with rst-aid/rst responder train-
ing, skills in automobile maintenance, and construction
skills are highly desirable. Please address these skills

Prof. Vincent Laudet at Yilan Marine Research Station
The Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology (ICOB;
http://icob.sinica.edu.tw) is one of the research insti-
tutes of Academia Sinica in Taiwan. Researchers at
ICOB investigate the basic mechanisms underlying cel-
lular functions and cell-cell interactions that coordinate
the growth and development of an organism and its
adaptation to an ever-changing environment. Current
research at ICOB comprises four focus areas: (1) Cel-
lular dysfunction, (2) Eco-Evo-Devo, (3) Neuroscience,
and (4) Stem cell and regenerative biology.
Prof. Vincent Laudet Marine Eco-Evo-Devo group uses
coral reef shes, and in particular anemonesh, to better
understand the role of hormones in life history transi-
tion, and specically metamorphosis. Prof. Vincent

an annelid worm. Transcriptomic proling of key organs
and hormone analysis of several developmental stages
of all 5 species will be investigated and compared to
each other. The post-doc will be responsible for the
sh part, using clownsh as a model system. She/He
will determine if similar transformations of organs oc-
cur in terms of cellular processes, with a focus on the
intestine (key organ facing changes during metamorpho-
sis). By examining transcriptomic regulation during
metamorphosis at both organismic and single-cell level,
she/he will search for shared regulatory mechanisms
among these distantly related animal models. Lastly,
she/he will perform functional analysis (such as pharma-March 1, 2022 EvolDir 71
cological treatment, CRISPR/cas9???) to test whether
these shared regulatory mechanisms are essential for
metamorphosis. This position will imply interactions
with dynamic international research groups that aim to

BielefeldU FurSealGenomics
4-year postdoc position: Genomics and epigenetics of
fur seals
With Dr Joe Homan (Bielefeld University, Germany),March 1, 2022 EvolDir 73
Prof. Toni Gossmann (Bielefeld University, Germany),
Dr Jaume Forcada (British Antarctic Survey, UK) and
Prof. Kees van Oers (Netherlands Institute for Ecology).
An outstanding opportunity is available for a post-
doctoral researcher to work on the evolutionary and
ecological genomics and epigenetics of fur seals. The
postdoc will be jointly supervised by Joe Homan
(www.thehomanlab.com) and Toni Gossman (tgoss-
mann.github.io), and will be based in the Department
of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University. The post-
doc is funded from now until the end of 2025 and is
funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG)
within the collaborative research centre (SFB/TRR 212)
entitled: A Novel Synthesis of Individualisation across
Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution: Niche Choice, Niche
Conformance, Niche Construction (NC3).
The project: The postdoc will exploit and continue to
build upon an exceptionally detailed long-term study
of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at Bird
Island, South Georgia. Here, local environmental warm-
ing and the loss of sea ice have progressively reduced
the availability of Antarctic krill, the fur seal's staple
diet. The aim of this project (sub-project A01 of the col-
laborative research centre) is to investigate how genetic
and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation
mediate short-term responses to environmental varia-
tion and facilitate long-term responses to environmental
change. We will combine the latest cutting-edge 'omics'
approaches, including high density SNP arrays and bisul-
phite sequencing, with detailed life-history data from
~800 individuals spanning a time series from the mid
1980s to the current day. This project will generate
detailed insights into the (epi-)genetic basis of tness
variation in a wild vertebrate, with implications for un-
derstanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics as
well as adaptation to climate change.
The applicant: We seek a bright and highly motivated
postdoc with a strong PhD in a relevant topic (e.g.
population or conservation genomics, ecological epige-
netics, marine biology). A deep understanding as well
as practical experience of working with high-throughput
sequencing data (e.g.DNA methylation, RAD sequenc-
ing, SNP array or whole-genome resequencing data)
is highly desirable, as is prociency in writing custom
scripts and working in Unix and R. Experience of quan-
tifying inbreeding from molecular data and / or working
with large-scale, long-term datasets from wild popula-
tions would be a bonus. The ideal candidate will also
be able to work both independently and as part of a
team. A high standard of spoken and written English
is required and a proven track record of publishing in
high quality international peer-reviewed journals would
be advantageous.The working environment: The postdoc will be based
at the Department of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld
University (https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/-
biologie/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/behaviour). The de-
partment is the oldest of its kind in Germany and cur-
rently hosts around six principal investigators, ten post-
docs and twenty PhD students. It oers a stimulating
international environment and an excellent research in-
frastructure including modern, well equipped molecular
laboratories. The working language of the Department
is English. The postdoc will also have the opportu-
nity to interact closely with Dr. Jaume Forcada at the
British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge and Prof. Kees
van Oers at the Netherlands Institute for Ecology.
Bielefeld University is particularly committed to the
career development of its employees. It oers attractive
internal and external training and further training pro-
grammes. Employees have the opportunity to use a va-
riety of health, counselling and prevention programmes.
Bielefeld University places great importance on a work-
family balance for all its employees. Bielefeld is a city of
325,000 inhabitants with an attractive historical centre
and easy access to the Teutoberger Wald for hiking and
other outdoor pursuits. It oers a very high standard
of living and is well connected to most major European
cities.
The collaborative research centre: The postdoc will be
embedded within a larger collaborative research centre
(SFB) comprising 18 principle investigators, 8 postdocs
and 16 PhD students based at Bielefeld University, the
University of M unster and the University of Jena. The
aim of the SFB is to produce a conceptual and empirical
synthesis of individualisation across behaviour, ecology
and evolution. The SFB will provide exceptional oppor-
tunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and academic
networking, together with structured training, scientic

Postdoc position at the Centre for Genomic Regulation
(CRG), Barcelona, Spain
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling group at the Cen-
tre for Genomic Regulation invites applications for a
postdoc position to study genetic variation and selectionin human genomes using computational data analysis,
population genetics and statistical methods.
https://recruitment.crg.eu/content/jobs/position/-
postdoctoral-researcher-group-evolutionary-processes-
modeling%E2%80%99 Deadline: 15 March 2022.
The Institute
The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an in-
ternational research institute of excellence, based in
Barcelona, Spain, with more than 400 scientists from
44 countries. The CRG is composed of an interdisci-
plinary, motivated and creative scientic team which is
supported both by a exible and ecient administration
and by high-end and innovative technologies.
In November 2013, the Centre for Genomic Regulation
(CRG) received the 'HR Excellence in Research' Award
from the European Commission. This is in recogni-
tion of the Institute's commitment to developing an HR
Strategy for Researchers, designed to bring the practices
and procedures in line with the principles of the Euro-
pean Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct
for the Recruitment of Researchers (Charter and Code).
The Role
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join
the \Evolutionary Processes Modeling" group. We use
computational analysis of sequencing data together with
population genetics predictions and statistical modeling
to answer questions about mutational processes and
selective pressures in cancer cells and in the human pop-
ulation. The ideal candidate should be highly motivated
and eager to work on evolutionary and biological prob-
lems through the use and development of computational
and statistical approaches.
About the Group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population genet-
ics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity. Our
group is particularly interested in how the evolution and
survival of cancer cell populations relies on mutation
inux as well as in selection inference from observed
mutation data. To this end, we develop mathemati-
cal and computational approaches to estimate muta-
tion rates and selection. Coding sequences of cancer
tumors not only exhibit positively selected mutations
that drive cancer (www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-
0572-y), but there also can exist a small fraction of genes
that the tumor cannot aord to lose (www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3987). In addition to genes, cancer driver
loci can occur in the non-coding part of the genome
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00100-x). Esti-
mates of the strength of selection in cancer allow for a
prioritization of genes and non-coding regions by their76 EvolDir March 1, 2022
disease relevance, with the ultimate goal of promoting
therapeutic advances.
We are also interested in mutation rates and selection
inference in the context of human genetic variation,
including polymorphisms (http://www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3831; academic.oup.com/mbe/article-
abstract/36/8/1701/5475505) and de novo variants
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17162-z). Here,
a particular focus of the group lies on the description
of purifying selection in humans and across species,
accounting for mutational processes as well as the
eects of genetic drift.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling lab was estab-
lished in October 2018. Further information can be
found at https://weghornlab.net/ and at www.crg.eu/-
en/programmes-groups/weghorn-lab . Whom would we
like to hire?

ComputationalPopulationGenetics
DTU Health Tech seeks qualied candidates for a post-
doc position in computational population genetics with
start as soon as possible.
Responsibilities In this position, you will develop algo-
rithms and computational methods to deal with the
analysis of large datasets from modern and ancient
sources. More specically, these algorithms will be
aimed at analyzing a large number of ancient genomes
using population genetics methods. Additional infor-
mation should be obtained by contacting the potential
main supervisor directly. The university is located in
the greater Copenhagen area, which is acknowledged for
its excellent standards of living, childcare and welfare
system.
Current computational methods are often ill-equipped
to deal with DNA extracted from ancient populations.
This ancient DNA shows high levels of fragmentation
and accumulated chemical damage. Furthermore, the
number of individuals that can be sequenced is often
limited. Fortunately, several problems pertaining to an-
cient DNA and ancient paleogenetics can be described in
a maximum-likelihood framework and computer science
techniques can help us to solve such numerical problems
eciently via machine learning, numerical algorithms
and data structures. You will work in collaboration with
other partners including the University of Copenhagen
in order to develop the next generation of algorithms
and software applied to DNA from fossils which can
then be used to reconstruct population history and infer
selection.
Qualications You must hold a PhD degree (or equiva-
lent) ideally in biological science with a focus on quanti-
tative and mathematical aspects, or in computer science
or mathematics.
The candidate we are looking for should ideally have
the following qualications:
* Knowledge of a programming language like Python,
Perl, C++ and/or Java * Ability to work in a UNIX
environment, ideally in a high-performance computing
environment * Thorough understanding of basic princi-
ples of population genetics * Knowledge of probabilities
and statistics * Firm grasp of rst-year university mathe-
matics (dierential calculus/linear algebra) * KnowledgeMarch 1, 2022 EvolDir 77
of coalescence theory or diusion theory is an advan-
tage * Expertise in next-generation sequencing data
generation and processing is also a plus
The language of communication at DTU is English.

SpeciationConservationGenomics
Madagascar
NSF-funded postdoc in speciation and conservation ge-
nomics
THE POSITION: The Yoder Lab at Duke University
seeks to hire a postdoctoral research associate with
skills in computational and speciation genomics. You
will become a member of a research team that takes an
integrative approach to speciation biology by combining
computer science, eld ecology, and genomic analysis.
The project is a collaboration with Ziheng Yang (Univer-
sity College London; computational biology) and Marina
Blanco (Duke Lemur Center; behavioral eld ecology).
Anticipated start date is April 15, 2022 with a starting
annual salary of $53,760, along with scheduled annual
increases. Funding is available for up to four years with
renewal determined annually.
THE PROJECT: The project will focus on southeastern
Madagascar where habitat fragmentation is threatening
the survival of unique and irreplaceable biodiversity. In
addition to generating important new knowledge about
the processes that drive and delimit speciation, the
project will include training and mentorship of both
Malagasy and American students across a range of edu-
cational levels. The research focuses on mouse lemurs,
which are the world's smallest primates and are unique
to Madagascar and builds on current research that in-
dicates that they have experienced episodic bursts of
lineage diversication consistent with the climatic cycles
of the Pleistocene. Key outcomes of the collaborative
project will be the development of genomic data and
computational tools for identifying the magnitude, di-
rection, and rate of genetic exchange among lineages
as well as a unique understanding of the roles of ecol-
ogy, metabolism, and sensory communication play in
inhibiting reproduction among the targeted species. The
advertised postdoctoral position will be devoted to il-
luminating the role of genomic architecture in driving
and maintaining species boundaries.
ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY & GENOMIC RE-
SOURCES: Mouse lemurs are fascinating creatures of
special biological interest given that they are genetically
highly distinct though morphologically and ecologically
similar. Notoriously, their taxonomy has exploded over78 EvolDir March 1, 2022
the past 25 years, with more than 20 species described
since 1994. Mouse lemurs reach sexual maturity within
the rst year of life, and typically reproduce annually
within a highly constrained seasonal timeframe that
is often correlated with the duration of a hibernation
season.
Female receptivity can be as short as several hours in
a given year. During the austral winter, individuals of
both sexes may enter periods of inactivity, ranging in
duration from hours (daily torpor) to weeks (hiberna-
tion). The project will focus on a region of Madagas-
car where ve distinct lineages, currently described as
species, occur in patterns of both sympatry and allopa-
try. Divergence time analysis using a pedigree-derived
measure of the de novo mutation rate (Campbell et al.,
2021; Heredity) indicates that they achieve reproductive
isolation extremely rapidly for a mammal which is a
driving motivation for the research (Poelstra et al., 2022;
bioRxiv). The project will benet from a number of
existing genomic resources including a reference genome
for one of the target species (Larsen et al., 2017; BMC
Genomics) as well as a newly released transcriptomic cell
atlas (The Tabula Microcebus Consortium; bioRxiv).
In-country outreach activities will build upon previous
eld-based genomics and associated workshops (Blanco
et al., 2020; Conservation Genetics).
QUALIFICATIONS: Applicants should have a PhD in
evolutionary genetics/genomics and strong computa-
tional skills. We seek an independent and collaborative
scientist with an interest in team-based science and a
generous approach to student training across a range of
educational levels. Applicants should be familiar with
the latest developments in genome assembly, population-
level resequencing, and statistical analysis of population
genomic data. Experience with single-cell genomics is a
plus.
WORK ENVIRONMENT: Duke University is located
in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. It
is a short drive from other top universities, including
UNC - Chapel Hill and NC State University, and has
rich programs in evolution, ecology, and genomics.
The region has diverse cultural resources and is conve-
niently situated between the Appalachian Mountains to
the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. As we like
to say: \turn right, and within 2.5 hours you can be
hiking in the Smokies; turn left, and in 2.5 hours you
can be lounging on some of the world's most beautiful
beaches." The Yoder Lab welcomes individuals of all
identities and backgrounds. We believe that the best
science comes from an environment that includes a va-
riety of lived experiences and in which all persons are
encouraged to express their opinions freely in a cultureof mutual respect.
HOW TO APPLY: Please direct applications and/or
questions to Anne Yoder

InvasiveMosquitoeEvolutionaryEcol
\Investigation of the ecological factors that determine
the spread of invasive mosquito species in Hungary, and
the development of prediction models"
Climate change combined with a signicant increase
in international trade and tourism constitute the main
causes behind the emergence of invasive species in Eu-
rope, which raise several ecological, epidemiological and
economic problems. To understand the biological basis
of this threat, we need to uncover the spatial and tem-
poral patterns in association with the introduction and
spread of invasive species, and to identify the underlying
ecological factors. The fullment of these tasks requires
the continuous monitoring of invasive species as well as
their role in ecological interactions, for which many Euro-
pean country has organised surveillance programs. The
Hungarian program run by the Centre for Ecological Re-
search (CER, https://ecolres.hu/en) since 2019 targets
three invasive species currently present in the country,
and consists of a survey based on citizen science that is
combined with subsequent eld sampling and laboratory
screens for parasites (http://mosquitosurveillance.hu).
Based on the accumulated data, we are able to gen-
erate reliable and distribution maps in real time, and
now an important part of our mission is to identify the
environmental factors determining the spread of the
focal species, for which we hope to attract a post-doc
providing theoretical/statistical inputs. We expect the
young researcher to help us eectively obtain and inves-
tigate as many predictor variables as possible, create
an ecological prole each invasive species, and derive
reliable estimates for future distribution dynamics. The
new colleague would be in charge of collecting spatially
and temporally structured data regarding the potential
environmental predictors (e. g. climate, urbanization,demography, road network, habitat type, mosquito con-
trol programs, etc.), assigning these data to the avail-
able species-distribution patterns by multivariate models
(ideally including machine learning), and then using the
resulting information to build prediction models.
The post-doc project is founded by the main Hungarian
funding body (National Research, Development and In-
novation Oce). The period of employment is one year,
but the position could potentially be extended by an
extra year in case of success. Given the covid situation
and the theoretical aspects of the project, we oer high
exibility with regard to the working routine and allow
remote contribution (while we also welcome group mem-
bers who can physically join the research team at CER).
The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant
union, the starting date is exible (but ideally as soon
as possible).
As a formal qualication, the candidate must hold a
PhD degree (or equivalent). Furthermore, we are look-
ing for candidates with the following qualications: -
Background in ecology or in evolution with consider-
able expertise in statistics; - Experience in data mining
and handling big data; - Experience in performing so-
phisticated statistical analyses (bioinformatics, machine

Jena Germany 3 EvoDevo
The Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, German, is
a traditional university with a strong research prole
located in central Germany. It is a university that covers
a wide range of disciplines. Research is focused on the
areas Light-Life-Liberty. Our university collaborates
closely with research institutions, research companies
and renowned cultural institutions. With around 18,000
students and more than 8,600 employees, the university
plays a major role in shaping Jena's character as a cos-
mopolitan and future-oriented city. The Institute for
Zoology and Evolutionary Research conducts modern
zoological research with a comparative evolutionary per-
spective. The research topics range from entomology
to functional vertebrate morphology, comparative devel-
opmental biology and animal physiology. The Hejnol
Lab invites applications for 2 Postdoc positions and the
Olsson Lab seeks 1 postdoc. The positions are to be
lled with
3 Research assistants (PostDocs) in Evolutionary Devel-
opmental Biology of animals (f/m/d)
commencing on 01. April 2022.
The Hejnol Lab oer several projects that range from
genomic analysis, morphology, to advanced comparative
developmental biological approaches of non-model or-
ganisms. We combine advanced methods in molecular
biology, genomics, electron- and light microscopy, and
single cell-omics to study a range of marine and limnic
non-model organisms. The projects will connect the
genotype-level of organisation with the phenotype andcompare the results using the comparative evolutionary
approach. The postdocs are expected to use existing
technology and moving the implementation of modern
techniques to non-model species forward. It is expected
to solve current questions in animal evolutionary biology
that relate to the evolution of cell types, organ systems,
developmental pathways, physiological processes, and
the interaction of the organism with the environment.
A large list of interesting evolutionary modications
including developmental, physiological, and morpholog-
ical traits in non-vertebrate species is available to be
studied, and choices can be inuenced by the prefer-
ence of the postdoc. Active contribution in teaching
and outreach, e.g., through the Phyletic Museum is ex-
pected. The mission of our groups is to understand how
nature's fascinating phenotypic diversity has evolved
and how genomic, cellular and developmental changes
led to this diversity. The work in the Hejnol lab in-
cludes bioinformatic and embryological work. Since the
Principal Investigator Andreas Hejnol is also director
of the Phyletic Museum the lab actively contributes to
its outreach activities. English is the working language
in our lab. The Olsson Lab works on comparative de-
velopmental studies of the head in vertebrates. The
focus has sofar been on amphibians and shes, but the
postdoc. is of course free to work on other organisms.
Main questions include the transition to biphasic and
terrestrial life cycles and the evolution of novelties asso-
ciated with these transitions. Techniques used includes
fate mapping, gene down- and up-regulation and gene
editing. Three-dimensional reconstruction of embryonic
and larval anatomy using confocal microscopy, microCT
and the synchrotron at DESY - in addition to histology -
is central to our research, as is standard methods such as
clearing-and-staining, Antibody-staining and in-situ hy-
bridization. Depending on the seniority of the candidate,
the degree of independency can be increased with the
opportunity to attract own funding, design own courses
and develop an own research path. The independency
will be visualised by e.g. own webpage. Further, the
opportunity for a habilitation will be provided.
Your responsibilities: You will conduct a research project
related to comparative developmental biology. You will
support the training and education of lab members and
students. You will conduct teaching of one or more
courses in zoology, evolutionary biology, molecular bi-
ology, or bioinformatics in the area of zoology ande-

Starting date: April 2022 (to be negotiated)
Apply until: February 28th, 2022 (position remains open
until lled)
Duration: 3 years
Postdoctoral position in Bioinformatics (m/f/d)
The Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich is one of
the largest and most renowned universities in Germany.
Working environment:
The established group \Genome Plasticity and Compu-
tational Genetics" managed by Korbinian Schneeberger
is focused on plant genomics, specically on the devel-
opment of novel computational and biotechnological
methods for the analysis of genome sequences. The
group is located at the Faculty of Biology at the LMU
in Munich, with a part of the group working at the
Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in
Cologne, Germany. We are currently searching for a
postdoc for our location at the MPI in Cologne.
Our group analyzes genomic changes on dierent levels.
We compare the genomes between species, populations
and articial crosses. We do this using latest technolo-
gies (including third generation as well as single-cell
genomic technology) to get insights into how and why
genomes change over time. Current projects include
genetic experiments and the establishment of compu-
tational methods for the analysis of multidimensional
genome data to study the natural diversity of mutations
and recombination.
We are a multi-disciplinary group including bioinfor-
maticians, biologists and biotechnologists (schneeberg-

and is closely aligned to our interests in new genomic
technologies. Scientic support comes from a wide range
of facilities (genomics, microscopy, high performance
compute clusters) and lab technicians. Salaries will
be based on previous experience according to TV-L
guidelines.
Project Description
We have recently developed a new method to assemble
the individual haplotypes of tetraploid genomes based
on the combination of long-read sequencing and the anal-
ysis of single pollen genomes (Sun et al, 2021, biorxiv).
We applied this method for the reconstruction of the
rst fully haplotype-resolved assembly of a cultivated
potato genome.
Following up on this work we now would like to make
use of the individual haplotypes and develop genotyping
methods for a simplied analysis of even more complex
genomes. The method should then be applied to geno-typing recombinant pollen genomes (which will allow us
to analyze the inheritance on the individual haplotypes)
as well as other potato cultivars. While applied in the
context of plant genomics, such haplotype-type based
genotyping would be applicable across many dierent
species including even humans.
Qualications
We are searching for highly motivated applicants with a
PhD in bioinformatics or a similar eld in computational
biology. Applicants should be procient in scripting e.g.
Python and should have experiences in the analysis of
next-generation sequencing data and in the use of a
high-performance compute cluster. Good oral and writ-

ViralEvolution
Postdoc: Evolution and phylodynamics of super-
generalist viruses
A postdoctoral research position is available in the Phy-
lodynamics Research Group led by David Rasmussen in
the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology and
the Bioinformatics Research Center at NC State Uni-
versity. The postdoc will participate in a NSF-funded
project exploring how tness tradeos limit viral host
range as well as how generalist viruses evolve to resolve
these tradeos. In particular, the postdoc will help con-
nect theory to data by developing new phylodynamic
methods for quantifying pathogen tness between dif-ferent host environments. These newly developed meth-
ods will then be applied to multi-host viral pathogens
in order to empirically measure tness dierences and
movement between alternative hosts.
While the intended project is largely computational,
the postdoc may combine method development with
experimental work on the super-generalist plant virus
tomato spotted wilt virus, which our lab uses as a model
system for studying viral adaptation to multiple hosts
(see here). This may include assisting in eld surveys
of TSWV genomic diversity and quantifying the tness
of individual viral genotypes on a panel of crops and
native plants. By combining the newly developed phy-
lodynamic methods with empirical measures of viral
tness on dierent hosts, we will be able explore how
tness tradeos evolve over time and shape the host
range of an extraordinary RNA virus.
The successful applicant can also build their mentor-
ing skills by co-supervising an undergraduate led meta-
analysis aimed at synthesizing current literature on how
tness tradeos shape viral host range more broadly in
plant, animal and human viruses. Applicants interested
in gaining teaching experience may also help develop
educational materials for teaching genomic epidemiol-
ogy and phylodynamics in a new series of international
workshops.
Applicants must hold a PhD in biology or a related eld.
Candidates with strong programming and bioinformatics
skills will be given the highest consideration. Previous
molecular and virology lab experience are highly sought,
but not essential. Most importantly, the candidate must
possess strong problem-solving skills and a record of
self-directed, innovative research.
Initial appointment is for one year, but position will be
renewable for up to two years. Start date would ideally
be Summer 2022.
Please apply using the link below and include a CV, a
brief cover letter describing research interests, a writing
sample (e.g. rst author publication) , and the contact
info for two references. Submission of a code sample
written by the applicant is also strongly encouraged.

TickBacteriaSymbiosis
A two-year position as a postdoctoral researcher at the
Ecology and Biology of Interactions laboratory of the90 EvolDir March 1, 2022
University of Poitiers (France) <https://ebi.labo.univ-
poitiers.fr/ >
24 months position, open from April 2022 or as soon as
possible thereafter.
How does mutualism with microbes emerge? How this
process favored the appearance and evolutionary ra-
diation of animal lineages whose nutrition is highly
specialized? Why are these mutualistic systems not
evolutionary stable? Through an innovative experimen-
tal approach using tick cell lines, we are looking for a
highly motivated and talented post-doc to work on these
fundamental questions.
Context: Mutualism with microbes is one of the keys
to the origins of complex life on Earth (Wernegreen,
2012; Bennett et al, 2015). In many cases, the host
and its benecial microbes merge into a single, coherent
symbiotic entity so that these mutualistic relationships
are considered stable associations over extremely long
periods. Yet recent evidence of gains and losses of mutu-
alistic symbionts suggests that the stability of benecial
mutualistic relationships is only apparent (Bennett et
al, 2015; McCutcheon et al, 2019). However, the mecha-
nisms favouring the extinction of ancestral, coevolved,
symbionts and their ultimate replacement by foreign,
less-coevolved, symbionts remain poorly understood. In
this context, our objective is to identify the evolutionary
mechanisms that drive extinction and reborn of mutu-
alistic interactions using ticks (Ixodida, Acari) as ideal
biological models to address this question. Ticks host
nutritional symbionts that are essential for their growth
and survival, but the origin of these symbionts varies
considerably between host species and substitution of
benecial symbionts can occur (Gottlieb et al, 2015;
Duron et al, 2018; Guizzo et al, 2017; Duron et al, 2017;
Binetruy et al, 2020).
Members of our consortium have demonstrated that
Francisella sp. (Gamma-proteobacteria: Thiotrichales:
Francisellaceae) is an obligatory symbiont for ticks by
providing them with B vitamins (Duron et al, 2018).
Surprisingly, from a large screening, most tick species
harbour a dierent intracellular symbiont, Coxiella sp.
(Gamma-proteobacteria: Legionellales:Coxiellaceae),
which is also able to synthetize B vitamins (Duron et
al, 2017; Binetruy et al, 2020). Overall, these works
show repeated replacements of Coxiella by Francisella
across the tick phylogeny (Duron et al, 2017; Binetruy
et al, 2020) but the factors favouring one nutritional
mutualist, over another, are not yet understood.
Post-doc project: The position is associated with the
ANR-funded collaborative project MICROM \Micro-
bial competition in mutualistic interactions with ticks".
The MICROM consortium, led by Olivier Duron, in-volves three teams (O. Duron MIVEGEC, Montpellier,
F. Vavre LBBE, Lyon and D. Bouchon EBI, Poitiers)
with excellent expertise in the eld of endosymbiosis.
MICROM aims at deciphering the competition between
Francisella and Coxiella symbionts using dierent ap-
proaches from genomics, transcriptomics, in vivo and in
vitro imaging. The recruited post-doc will participate
in this innovative program with a particular focus on
in vitro experiments assessing the competitive abilities
of the two benecial symbionts. The post-doc will be
responsible for monitoring tick cell lines, performing
infection and co-infection and characterising the cellular
phenotypes. Methods include RT-qPCR, dual-RNAseq,
FISH combined with electron microscopy.
Teams, lab and location: The post-doc will be part of
the Ecology, Evolution & Symbiosis team of the EBI
laboratory in Poitiers, which has a long experience in re-
search on symbiosis. The post-doc will have access to the
funding and infrastructures needed for this project, in a
stimulating scientic environment. Regular exchanges
and mobility are planned with the various project part-
ners as well as with external collaborators such as the
Tick Cell BioBank in Liverpool.
Remuneration will be between euro 2,663 and euro 3,789
gross per month depending on experience.
Relevant expertise: We are looking for an autonomous
and highly motivated candidate with a genuine interest
in symbiosis research with expertise in the following
areas: - Cell culture - Molecular biology - Imaging
approaches, cellular biology, histology. Experience in
electron microscopy is a plus. - Interested in acquir-
ing expertise in experimentation with arthropods: care,
injection, dissection - Expertise in genomics and bioin-
formatics is a plus

Evolution of symbiosis -Host immunity manipulation as
an adaptation for symbiosis
A Postdoctoral Research Assistant position is available
at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in Dr
Lee Henry???s group to investigating ???Host immu-
nity manipulation as an adaptation for symbiosis???.
This is a BBSRC-NSF/BIO funded project that aims
tounderstand how host immune systems are modied,
or manipulated, to recognise and host benecial mi-
crobes, while still resisting harmful pathogens. The
project involves state-of-the-art techniques in genomics
and molecular biology (e.g. RNAi, CRISPR), and exper-
imentally manipulations of herbivorous insects (aphids)
and their symbionts.
We have shown that hosting benecial microbes results
in a sharp decrease in the expression of key immune
genes in aphids. In this project, the successful applicant
will answer the questions: do symbionts manipulate
host immune systems to establish in hosts, or have hosts
evolved a modied immune response to facilitate symbio-
sis? and do host???s trade-o in their ability to harbour
benecial symbionts and resist pathogens?
An ideal candidate should have a PhD (or be close to
completion) in Evolutionary Biology, Genomics, Genet-
ics or a related eld. They should provide evidence
of expertise in lab skills in molecular biology. Alter-
natively, if candidates are more data-analysis oriented,
they should provide evidence of programming skills and
should be procient in transcriptome or genome anal-
yses. A proven track record of published research is
essential. Self-motivation, an ability to work as part of
a team and an interest in new research questions will
be fundamental to the position.
Queen Mary is one of the top research-led universities
in the UK and was ranked 9thamong the UK multi-
faculty universities in the Research Excellence Frame-
work (REF 2014). All postdoctoral researchers are part

range of ??33,824 - ??34,733 per annum, inclusive of
London allowance.
We oer access to a generous pension scheme, 30 days???
leave per annum (pro-rata for xed-term), season ticket
loan scheme and access to a comprehensive range of
personal and professionaldevelopment opportunities.In
addition, weoer a range of work life balance and family

Three postdoc positions: genetics and genomics of sex-

Max Reuter and Aida Andr >1
2s groups, University Col-
lege London
We are hiring three postdocs to work with us on an am-
bitious and inter-disciplinary project on the genetics and
genomics of sexual antagonism in Drosophila, funded
by awards from the Leverhulme Trust and the Biotech-
nology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The
project aims to 1) identify high-condence sexually an-
tagonistic loci in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster,
2) functionally characterise and experimentally validate
such loci, 3) estimate their antagonistic tness eects in
wild populations and 4) infer the evolutionary history
of antagonistic variants and assess their contribution
to standing genetic and phenotypic variation in popula-
tions. The project integrates experimental approaches
(experimental evolution, tness and phenotypic assays,
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing) and computational pop-
ulation genomics (Approximate Bayesian Computation
and/or Machine Learning). Thanks to the scale and
complexity of the research programme, the project oers
opportunities for each team member to lead particular
aspects of the work (and resulting publications) and has
scope for further directions developed by each postdoc.
We are seeking three highly motivated individuals with
complementary skills (see the job description and per-
son specication linked below) to become part of this
highly collaborative team. The postdocs will be embed-
ded within the groups of both Max Reuter and Aida
Andr >1
2s at UCL and work in collaboration with Alistair
McGregor at Durham University. Additional funding
through a BBSRC Australia Partnering Award will also
make it possible to collaborate with the research group
of Tim Connallon at Monash University (Melbourne,
Australia).
Work in Max Reuter's group (http://-
www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/ ~ ucbtmre/Labsite/-
Home.html) aims to understand the interplay between
the genetic architecture of traits and their evolution.
Approaches used include experimental work in fruit iesand yeast, genomic approaches and theory. We recently
published a genome-wide analysis of sexually antago-
nistic loci in Drosophila (Ruzicka et al. 2019, PLoS
Biology), from which this project follows on. Work in
Aida Andr >1
2s's group (https://wp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/evol-
genome/) uses computational and population genetics
to identify the signatures that natural selection leaves
in genomes. We work on local adaptation (eg Key et al.,
PLoS Genetics 2018) and balancing selection, where we
develop methods to identify its genetic signatures and
analyse genomes to identify loci harbouring balanced
polymorphisms (Bitarello et al., 2018, GBE).
Our groups are based in the Research Department
of Genetics, Evolution and Environment (https://-
www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee), home to a vibrant re-
search community spanning the elds of evolutionary
genetics and genomics, phylogenetics, human genetics,
evo-devo, ageing, and ecology and biodiversity. The
department oers a friendly, interactive and collabo-
rative environment, including a large and supportive
community of early-career researchers. Academic life
is animated by a number of seminar series featuring
international, national and local speakers, as well as
regular social events (such as weekly coee mornings)
that oer opportunities for informal interactions.
Our institution, UCL, is a large university in the cen-
tre of London. It oers a rich and research-focussed
environment, with access to state-of-the-art research
facilities. London is a big and multicultural city with
world-class cultural life, beautiful countryside in easy
reach and (yes, still) excellent transport links to Europe
and the rest of the world.
The positions are available from 1 April 2022 (nego-
tiable) for 36 months (two posts) and 30 months (one
post). Further details, including the job description
and person specication and a link to application sys-

Postdoctoral position in Viral Landscape Phylogeogra-

as soon as possible (and no latter than the 1st of July,

A 2-year post-doc position is open at the Spa-

of Brussels (ULB) to work on landscape phylo-
geographic approaches (https://spell.ulb.be/subject/-
landscape-phylogeography). The position is available
immediately and should start no later than July 1, 2022.
The researcher will work on a research project funded
by an Incentive Grant for Scientic Research awarded
by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientique (FNRS, Bel-
gium).
The ght against high-impact viral diseases would ben-
et from a better understanding of the drivers of virus
spreads, which could in turn help designing intervention
strategies. There is a need for analytical approaches
allowing to formally test the impact of environmental
(e.g. ecologic, climatic or anthropogenic) factors on the
dispersal of viruses. Recent advances in genomics, math-
ematical modelling and computational biology have led
to evolutionary approaches becoming key methods to in-
vestigate the spread of infectious diseases. In particular,
the development of a spatially-explicit phylogeographic
method has enabled to reconstruct dispersal history of
epidemics on a continuous space, using only a relatively
limited number of viral sequences sampled from known
locations and times. At the Spatial Epidemiology Lab
(University of Brussels, ULB), one of our main research
projects consists in exploiting such spatially-explicit phy-
logeographic to unravel the impact of external factors
on the dispersal history and dynamics of viral spreads.
Specically, we aim to develop, test, compare, apply,
and share novel approaches to analyse the impact of envi-
ronmental factors on the dispersal history and dynamic
of viral lineages.The researcher will work on the development, test, and
application of new methodological approaches to com-
bine phylogeographic inference and analyses of the im-
pact of environmental factors. Once tested with simula-
tion procedures, the best methodologies will be applied
on several case studies associated with notable wildlife
and socio-economic impacts (e.g. West Nile virus, Lassa
virus, avian inuenza viruses, and rabies virus).
The researcher will be aliated and work within the
Spatial Epidemiology Lab (SpELL, http://spell.ulb.be),
which has a recognised expertise in spatial and molecular
epidemiology. Globally, the Spatial Epidemiology Lab
aims to study the eect of spatial factors on the emer-
gence, spread, persistence and evolution of diseases, as
well as invasive species. The understanding of key spatial
factors, such as environmental or anthropogenic vari-
ables, and their integration into spatial models is used to
predict the geographical distribution of risk, which can
contribute to better targeted prevention, surveillance
and control measures.
The candidate should hold a Ph.D. in evolution-
ary biology, molecular epidemiology or phylogeogra-
phy/population genetics, should have a strong interest
in epidemiology and ecology, and should have demon-
strated computational, communication and writing skills
(English). Knowledge and use of the programming lan-
guage R is required.
Applications should include a cover letter, a curriculum
vitae, PDFs of the three most representative publica-
tions, and a list of three references with e-mail contact
information. Applications should be submitted as soon
as possible.

Polar bears in Canada are a Species of Special Concern.
This project will assess the population-level health of
polar bears from across the Canadian Arctic, and some
zoo animals, by exploring spatial patterns in the bio-
logical age of individuals, population changes in mean
biological age through time, and the relationship be-
tween biological age and environments. Lifetime stress
tends to accelerate biological age, so that individuals
who have lived more stressful lives tend to be older than
their chronological age. Because biological age reects
overall health it is a good measure of lifetime experiences.
Management action in response to population declines
and the loss of genetic diversity is critical but can only
occur in response to declines that have occurred or are
occurring. Explorations of patterns of biological ageing
patterns indicative of population-level stress could help
target management action before or in the early stages
of decline, periods where they should be more eective.

ModellingVegetationDynamics
Postdoctoral position in modelling vegetation dynamics
The Research Group of Environmental and Applied
Botany at the University of Genoa, School of Maths,
Physics and Natural Sciences, Dept. of Earth, Envi-
ronment and Life Sciences, Genoa, is recruiting a post-
doctoral Research Assistant (m/f/d) to work in the
EU-funded research project ECOLOPES, limited to 12
months (100%, approx. 40 h/week, net salary approx.
1600 euro/month).
ECOLOPES (www.ecolopes.eu) is a HORIZON 2020-
FET OPEN funded research project proposing a radical
change for city development: instead of minimizing the
negative impact of urbanisation on nature, we aim at ur-
banisation to be planned and designed such that nature
- including humans - can co-evolve within the city. We
envisage a radically new integrated ecosystem approach
to architecture that focuses equally on humans, plants,
animals, and associated organisms such as microbiota.
ECOLOPES will provide the technology that will help
to achieve this vision.
The advertised position will be critical in implement-
ing the modelling of population dynamics and resource
requirements of plants into the computational architec-
tural tools developed in ECOLOPES.
Your tasks
The post-doc will adapt and parameterize the model
FATE-HD, that simulates plant functional groups dy-
namics based on abiotic ltering, competition for light,
and dispersal, etc.
Plant traits, related to resource and abiotic require-
ments (e.g., N-xation), life-cycle strategies, and human
acceptance (e.g., appearance) will be integrated at the
plant functional group (PFG) level. PFG dynamics
will be spatially and temporally modelled as a function
of soil, architecture, abiotic conditions, animals, and
human management (e.g., mowing, weeding) using the
FATE-HD model.
Specic tasks to be developed:
§Design relevant Functional Groups for ECOLOPES
from the global oras
§Parameterization of FATE-HD to ECOLOPES Func-tional Groups (e.g., relations with abiotic constraints,
response to disturbances, and simplied demography
and dispersal)
§Integration of the regional and local scales dynamics
§Running of simulations and adapt or develop post-
treatment scripts.
§Validation of the temporal dynamics using observations
Titles and skills
§University degree (M.Sc.) and Ph.D. in ecology, biol-
ogy, environmental sciences, or a comparable eld of
study
§Experience in modelling of population dynamics
§Excellent knowledge of R
§Experience in quantitative ecology
§Experience in modelling plant population dynamics
§Experience in using FATE-HD welcome
§Interested in interdisciplinary approaches
§Good language skills (English)
§Ability to work in a team
Oer
We oer an interesting and challenging job in a moti-
vated international team, at the University of Genoa
(Genoa, Italy). ECOLOPES partners are the Technical
University of Munich in Germany (leader partner), the
University of Genoa in Italy, the Technical University of

EvolutionOfHostAdaptation
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW IN EVOLUTIONARY
MICROBIOLOGY We are announcing a 2-years post-
doctoral fellowship in Lionel Guy's research group at
Uppsala University.
PROJECT Our group is studying the evolution of host-
adaptation in bacteria. In this particular project, we
aim to explore early infections and the role of phagocy-
tosis. The ability to feed on other organisms through
phagocytosis is a crucial step in the evolution of eukary-
otes, a prerequisite for food webs, multicellularity and,
arguably, the acquisition of mitochondria. It also paved
the way for intracellular parasitism, as some bacteria
avoided digestion by their hosts and multiplied in the
nutrient-rich cytoplasm. Here, we focus on the Deep-
branching Intracellular Gammaproteobacteria (DIG), a
large group of related bacteria (e.g. Legionella and Fran-
cisella) with a wide variety of host-adaptation strategies.
We hypothesize that the last common ancestor of DIG,
appeared during eukaryogenesis, circa 2 billion years ago,
and was among the rst bacteria to infect eukaryotes.
To test this hypothesis, the fellow will gather a solid
set of DIG genomes, reconstruct their evolutionary his-
tory, assess their metabolic potential, and identify theirMarch 1, 2022 EvolDir 107
host-adaptation genes. The goal is to better understand
the relationships between the rst eukaryotes and their
early invaders, thereby shedding light on eukaryogenesis,
particularly on the role of phagocytosis.
FORM Two-years post-doctoral fellowship (SEK 300
000, circa EUR 28 300, per annum), free of tax. Fel-
lowship rules exclude candidates with a PhD from, or
already employed at, the host institution (Uppsala Uni-
versity). The candidate should in principle have ob-
tained their PhD at most six years before the start of
the project. The candidate has to be approved by the
funder. Starting date: to be discussed. The fellowship
is funded by the Carl Trygger Foundation.

UppsalaU SexChromosomeEvolution
PostDoc Position at Uppsala University - Sex chromo-
some evolution Systematic Biology, Department of Or-
ganismal Biology, Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala
University, Sweden.
A two-year position on a Carl Tryggers post-doc stipend
is available to research sex chromosomes evolution in
morabine grasshopper with Dr. Octavio M. Palacios-
Gimenez at Uppsala University.
Project description: Sex is a fundamental and ancient
feature of eukaryotic reproduction often associated with
the presence of specialized sex chromosomes involved in
male or female development. Despite the importance
and conservation of sexual reproduction, there is a no-
table diversity of sex chromosomes within and between
sexes: XY system (male XY, female XX) and ZW sys-
tem (male ZZ, female ZW). This diversity is likely to
have key consequences for multiple facets of evolution,
as sex chromosome play critical roles in adaptation, spe-
ciation and sexual dimorphism but it is unclear how sex
chromosomes form and what kind of sex-specic changes
occur in newly evolved sex chromosomes. Understand-
ing the causes and consequences of sex chromosome
evolution requires study systems where sex chromo-
somes have evolved recently and independently several
times. The overall aim of this project is to investigate
the early signatures of sex chromosome evolution using
the grasshopper Vandiemenella viatica species complex.
Multiple chromosomal fusions between the ancestral X
chromosome and autosomes (neo-X) resulted in the for-
mation of new Y chromosomes in dierent races/species.
The independent sex chromosome mutations in the V.
viatica species complex thus allow independent compar-
isons to investigate the timing and patterns of newly
evolved sex chromosomes. The project will use genomics,
transcriptomics, single cell resolution, and cytogenetics
to answer: how is recombination suppressed between sex
nascent sex chromosomes? How does gene regulation
evolve after recombination suppressions? How fast does
the neo-Y degenerate after recombination suppression?
Requirements: Applicants should hold a PhD degree
in biology, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics or a re-
lated eld, and general molecular biology laboratory
skills. Experience with analyzing dierent types of
single-molecule sequencing, HiC and RNA-seq data, as108 EvolDir March 1, 2022
well as annotation of genes and repetitive elements, is re-
quired. Candidates must have received their PhD from
an institute other than the Institute of Organismal Bi-
ology at Uppsala University and cannot currently have
employment at the Department of Organismal Biology.
Prociency in spoken and written English is required.
Additional qualications: Programming in Perl, Python

Type of position: Postdoctoral fellowship for 24 months,
salary provided by the Carl Tryggers Foundation.

#Post-doctoral fellowship on Diversication dynamics
of interspecic competition
The laboratory of Macroecology and Macroevolution
(LabMeMe) at Universidade de S ao Paulo, Brazil, is
seeking for a motivated postdoctoral fellow to work on
a project entitled \Diversication dynamics of interspe-
cic competition: the role of niche similarity and spatial
overlap". The main goal of the project is to study the
role of species competition on diversication dynamics
by developing and applying (to fossil record data) new
models designed to measure the \intensity of competi-
tion" (please see the abstract of the project below). The
fellowship is initially designed for 2 years but might be
extended.#Project abstract: Most macroevolutionary approaches
designed to study the role of species interactions on
diversication dynamics have relied on rather indirect
evidence. Interspecic competition has been the most
often studied kind of interaction. The following pat-
terns have been interpreted as evidence of competition:
a- statistical association between diversity trajectories
of two potential competitor clades; b- the inference of
diversity- dependent diversication dynamics (within
or between clades); c- a statistical association between
diversication rates of two or more clades. Addition-
ally, most previous studies have not explicitly taken
into account spatial overlap, except perhaps by doing
analysis at the continental level. That said, the eld
of macroevolution has recently advanced by developing
new processed-based models devoted to study interspe-
cic competition. Unfortunately, those have, for the
most part, been focused on the use of molecular phylo-
genies and on the eect of species interactions on trait
evolution. Here we propose to develop new models that
better capture the nature of interspecic competition
and use those models to study the eect of interspecic
competition within and between clades on diversica-
tion dynamics. More specically, we will develop and
use models that take into account niche similarity and
spatial overlap to build times series that described the
\intensity of competition". Dierent lineages of mam-
mals, in particular families within Carnivora, will be
targeted as the study systems.
#Desired qualications and skills include:
a PhD in evolution, ecology, paleobiology or related
elds.
strong quantitative background
Knowledge of at least one programming language (R,
Python, or others).
#Application Instructions:
Applicants must submit, in a single pdf, the following

Research Associate for an NSF-funded project. The goal
of this project is to investigate adaptations that regulate
parent-ospring conict in moss plants. The primary
responsibilities of the postdoctoral researcher will be the
laboratory-based generation of DNA sequence data using
herbarium specimens followed by bioinformatic analysis
to analyze the evolution of morphological structures
involved in the parent-ospring conict. Opportunities
will also be available to develop novel research ques-
tions focusing on the functional morphology, physiology,
and evolution of the parent-ospring conict in mosses.
Supervising and mentoring undergraduate researchers
in both the laboratory and eld will be required. An
additional aim of this project is to build awareness of
and appreciation for plants and botanical natural his-
tory collections. As part of the team, the postdoc will
engage middle school students in hands-on activities and
develop a May-term course for undergraduate students
at the University of Tennessee. About The Department

Online SpeciesDistribution May9-13
Dear all,
registration is open for the 3rd edition of the Physalia
course \Species distribution and ecological niche mod-
elling in R"Dates: May 9th-13th (Online)
Course website:( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course45/ )
This course will encompass the theory and practice
of species distributions models (SDM) and ecological
niche models (ENM), spanning the underlying concepts,
methods, and applications. We will address the caveats
and challenges of these models, and see how to make
the most of their strengths while avoiding their most
common pitfalls. Participants will build and validate
models based on species occurrence data of their choice,
and learn how to apply these models to a variety of
purposes.
The course is aimed at students, researchers and practi-
tioners at any career stage with an interest in building
and applying species distribution and/or ecological niche
models in a reproducible and automated way.

EvoWorkingGroup May9-12
We are seeking postdoctoral and graduate student ap-
plicants from diverse backgrounds to participate in a
fully funded working group focusing on exploring the
role of evolutionary processes in long-term ecological re-
search, with an emphasis on grassland plants. The aim
of this working group is to facilitate collaborations be-
tween ecologists and evolutionary biologists by realizing
the opportunity that Long-Term Ecological Research
(LTER) sites provide for conducting eco-evolutionary
research.
Biologists increasingly recognize that ecological and
evolutionary processes are closely linked. This is partic-
ularly relevant in the context of global change, where en-
vironmental conditions may change rapidly, and species
may adapt to the novel conditions in a comparable
timeframe. Unfortunately, studies that examine the in-
teractions and feedback loops between evolutionary and
ecological processes, particularly in long-term ecological
studies, are rare. The working group will address this
problem by rst identifying barriers that exist to de-
veloping evolutionary biology work at LTER sites and,
second, identifying possible solutions. In doing so, the
working group will develop a framework for how to best
implement future eco-evolutionary research in a long-
term ecological research context. Lastly, the main goal
of this working group is to unite early-career ecologists
and evolutionary biologists with postdoc and gradu-
ate students to create a new cohort of eco-evolutionary
scientists!
The working group will be held at *Sevilleta
National Wildlife Refuge LTER* <https://-
unmsevilletaeldstation.wordpress.com/ >in La
Joya, NM on *May 9th-12th, 2022*. We expect
participants will arrive Sunday night (May 8th) and
depart Friday morning (May 13th). *Travel to/from
and accommodation at the UNM Sevilleta Field Station
will be provided, and all meals **will be catered for
the duration of the working group*. *There will be
no costs for participants*. The format will be a daily
morning plenary, followed by break-out focus groups,
evening graduate and postdoc posters, and informal
discussion. Please be aware that we will be abiding by
CDC guidelines and requiring proof of vaccination toattend in-person. Remote participation will also be
available to those who cannot or do not feel comfortable
attending in-person. Our goal is to hold a productive
meeting where all feel safe and comfortable - as such,
we will be monitoring the ever-changing situation and
making changes when necessary!
The organizers of the working group greatly value diver-
sity, equality of opportunity, and human dignity. *Sci-
entists who are LGBTQ+, Black, Hispanic, Latin(o/a),
Indigenous, Asian, Asian American, Pacic Islander,
two or more races/ethnicities, or veterans are especially
encouraged to apply*. To apply, email Jenny Cocciardi
(jenny.cocciardi@jhu.edu) with the subject line \Evo-
LTER Working Group Application" with; 1) a copy of
your CV, 2) an abstract describing research that you
would like to present on at the working group (limit
300 words), and, 3) a one-page diversity, equity, and
inclusion statement describing your experiences and com-
mitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion
in STEM. The research may be in the elds spanning
ecology and evolutionary biology, but preferably with
an element of both (including, but not limited to; plant
eco-evo-devo biology, global change ecology, adaptation
to climate change, phenology, plant physiology and mor-
phology, phenotypic plasticity, quantitative genetics and
genomics, community ecology, population genetics, etc.).
*Applications are due March 4th*and applicants will be
notied of the decision to attend by March 14th, 2022.
Undergraduate students who have conducted research
that they feel ts well with the working group's main
aims may also apply. Applicants are encouraged to
email Jenny Cocciardi (jenny.cocciardi@jhu.edu) with
any questions and inquiries on the working group!

Course description:
The concept of \characters" lies at the heart of many
central issues in evolutionary biology. Characters dis-
tinguish taxa, cause tness dierences, and generally
are the fundamental units of comparison for studies
of phenotypic evolution. Historically, the concept of
characters originated in morphology and comparative
anatomy, where it was intimately connected to the issue
of homology. At the same time, characters in evolu-
tionary genetics have been understood as the eective
dimensions along which a population is evolving. Both
the more historical and functional conceptions of biolog-
ical characters presuppose that phenotypes are modular
enough that it makes sense to compare or model parts
of organisms directly rather than whole organisms. To-
day, the notion of characters or traits is increasingly
used to describe dynamic lower-level phenomena such as
metabolic, physiological, and developmental processes.
This raises a number of challenging but interesting con-
ceptual issues. How can we dene characters or traits
when the object under study is a process? Is it pos-
sible to modularize regulatory mechanisms into quasi-
independent characters? What light can contemporary
systems biology shed on the partitioning of the pheno-
type into characters? We do not yet have answers to
these important questions. We have gathered a select
group of empirical investigators and theoreticians from
the elds of biochemistry, physiology, developmental
biology, and evolutionary biology together with mathe-
matical modelers, and philosophers of biology to discuss
how characters can be dened, identied, and charac-
terized in the age of integrative systems biology. Is it
still useful to talk about characters? And if so, what
should the concept incorporate to guide research in the
right direction? Evolutionary biology lies at the very
heart of biology. Therefore, this topic is relevant far
beyond its boundaries. Properly tackling it requires
the kind of transdisciplinary exchange of ideas and ap-
proaches we are planning to implement in this course.
The summer school is mainly aimed at early-stage (PhD
or postdoc) empirical and theoretical researchers with
a general background and/or interest in developmental
and/or evolutionary biology. More senior investigators
are welcome to apply as well. Exceptions can be made
for motivated masters students. Participants of previ-
ous Venice Summer Schools in Evo-Devo are expressly
encouraged to reapply as this course has an entirely
dierent topic than previous editions. The course will
equip participants with the conceptual tools to engage
in a productive discussion of the notion of \characters,"
and to relate this notion to their own research questions120 EvolDir March 1, 2022

May27-Jun6
The 2022 Workshop on Molecular Evolution at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mas-
sachusetts, USA, will be held *** MAY 27 to JUNE 6
*** (note that this is earlier than past years).
The deadline for applications *** has been extended
to MARCH 7, 2022 *** : see https://www.mbl.edu/-
education/courses/workshop-on-molecular-evolution/
Founded in 1988, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution
is the longest-running workshop of its kind. The Work-
shop is the premier program for integrating the meth-
ods, theory, and applications of molecular phylogenetics,statistical genetics, molecular evolution, and related
disciplines. Students work closely with internationally-
recognized scientists, receiving: (i) high-level instruc-
tion in the principles of molecular evolution, phyloge-
netic inference, and evolutionary genomics; (ii) advanced
training in statistical methods best suited to modern
datasets; and (iii) hands-on experience with the latest
software tools (often from the authors of the programs
they are using). The material is delivered via lectures,
discussions, and bioinformatic exercises motivated by
contemporary topics in molecular evolution. A hallmark
of this workshop is the direct interaction between stu-
dents and eld-leading scientists. The workshop serves
graduate students, postdocs, and established faculty
from around the world seeking to apply the principles
of molecular evolution to questions of both basic and
applied biological sciences. A priority of this workshop
is to foster an environment where students can learn
from each other as well from the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to
use the following software to address questions con-
cerning the phylogeny (including phylogenetic net-
works), divergence times, eects of selection, and migra-
tion: ASTRAL, FigTree, IQTree, MIGRATE, MrBayes,
RevBayes, PAML, PAUP*, RAxML, and SNaQ. Stu-
dents will have the opportunity to work with software
on their own laptops as well as receive training on how
to use the same programs on a computer cluster.
In 2022 the course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joe
Bielawski, Jeremy Brown, Minh Bui, Belinda Chang,
Scott Edwards, Deise Goncalves, Tracy Heath, John
Huelsenbeck, Lacey Knowles, Aki Laruson, Paul Lewis,
Emily Jane McTavish, Claudia Solis-Lemus, Ed Susko,
David Swoord, Katie Taylor, and Anne Yoder.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listedMarch 1, 2022 EvolDir 121
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
