Symposium:
Progress in Environmental Stress, Adaptation and Evo-
lution
August 22-26, 2004 at Sandbjerg, Denmark
Sponsors:
European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
Faculty of Sciences and Center for Environmental Stress
Research, University of Aarhus (DK)
Aim:
Most organisms and populations have to cope with hos-
tile environments, threatening their existence. Their
ability to respond phenotypically and genetically to
these challenges and to evolve adaptive mechanisms is,
therefore, crucial. The aim of the symposium is to un-
derstand, from an evolutionary perspective, the impact
of stress on biological systems. We have invited speak-
ers that at diﬀerent organizational levels, from genesSeptember 1, 2004 EvolDir 3
to individuals and populations, explore how organisms
adapt to (extreme) environments genetically and phys-
iologically, how stress changes genetic structure and af-
fects life histories and how environmental and genetic
stress shape selection pressure and causes extinction of
populations.
These issues have already been dealt with in a sympo-
sium on stress and evolution during the 5th Interna-
tional Congress of Evolutionary Biology and System-
atics in Budapest (1966), and in the end resulted in
a book edited by us Environmental Stress, Adaptation
and Evolution (1997) published in the Birkh¨ auser EXS
series (EXS 83). It is now nearly ten years later and
knowledge and (genomic) techniques in this research
ﬁeld have progressed rapidly. Therefore, we are think-
ing a follow-up to be timely and are organising this
small, 3 day symposium on the same issues
Structure:
The number of participants will be limited to around
50, of which 15 are reserved for invited speakers (for list
see below). There will be room for maximal 40 presen-
tations of which 25 are open for contributed talks (25
min.). In conjunction with the symposium a special
thematic issue of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology
will be published on the topic that will contain high
quality papers by the invited speakers. In addition, it
will be possible for contributed papers to be included
in this special issue of JEB. This will ensure that the
papers get lots of exposure in this thematic setting. Pa-
pers for the special issue will be selected by the organis-
ers of the symposium and the chief editor of JEB, Juha
Merila. Mind that all manuscripts, including those of
the invited speakers, will not be treated favourably for
this special issue. They are subject to normal, rigor-
ous peer-review and scope limits of the journal: they
have to address important evolutionary, and not purely
functional, problems.
Participation:
Those that are interested in the symposium topic
and want to participate and/or present a paper are
kindly invited to contact the organisers from now
on. Please do send your application asap to Corneel
Vermeulen ( <mailto:c.j.vermeulen@biol.rug.nl >
c.j.vermeulen@biol.rug.nl) who will collect
and structure applications (but for safety
do send also a cc to both Volker Loeschcke
(<mailto:volker.loeschcke@biology.au.dk >
volker.loeschcke@biology.au.dk) and Kuke
Bijlsma ( <mailto:r.bijlsma@biol.rug.nl >
r.bijlsma@biol.rug.nl)). As we, in addition to the
invited speakers, can only accommodate around 35
participants, the symposium might easily become over-booked. If this is the case the organisers will select
participants and contributions that seem to ﬁt that
symposium and the special volume of JEB the best.
Therefore it is important that tentative participants
provide a few lines about their research interests, and
if they want to present a contribution, please provide
also a title and a substantial abstract (up to 200
words). Membership of ESEB is not prerequisite, but
gives a discount of the conference fee and might give
some priority.
Practical information:
Title: Progress in Environmental Stress, Adaptation

DROSOPHILA COMPARATIVE GENOMICS:
Progress and Prospects Symposium - October 30 and
31, 2004 Hosted by the Tucson Drosophila Species
Stock Center and the Institute for Biomedical Sciences
and Biotechnology University of Arizona Tucson
The symposium-workshop will begin with a 6:00PM
dinner at the Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum and
guest presentation on Saturday night, October 30, and
end on Sunday, October 31, at 5:00PM. The event has
two goals:
(1) to inform the community about the progress of
the genome sequencing projects for twelve Drosophila
species and the development of related resources such
as BAC libraries and living stocks; (2) to engage mem-
bers of the Drosophila community, including represen-
tatives from the sequencing, BAC, and genome analysis
centers as well as computational and experimental bi-
ologists, in synthetic discussions focused upon the usesof these new resources to address questions of interest.
Sunday’s program will have four components: 1. Sta-
tus report of the sequencing and BAC projects for all
twelve species, including assembly, annotation and dis-
semination of information 2. Presentation of genetic
and chromosome maps of the twelve species and issues
of synteny: what we know and what needs to be done
next? 3. Comparative functional genomics and gene
expression: What we know and what comes next? 4.
Open forum regarding how to best make these resources
useful to the community and what new resources should
be developed.
The registration fee of $150 includes the Saturday night
dinner, attendance at the symposium on Sunday, in-
cluding morning and afternoon refreshments. Space is
limited. Persons interested in attending should con-
tact Sharon Richards, Center for Insect Science at in-
sects@arl.arizona.edu. The symposium itself will be
held at the Marriott Hotel University Park in Tucson
where rooms have been reserved for symposium atten-
dees.

ASEX - 10 positions available Students and researchers
interested in the paradox of sex in evolutionary biol-
ogy are strongly encouraged to send an expression of
interest to work in the European Union Marie Curie
Research Training Network SEXASEX. Criteria of el-
igibility include: EU citizenship, less than 4 years of
research experience for Young Researchers (YR), less
than 10 years for Experienced Researchers (ER), and a
willingness to work in a European country other than
the country of origin. We seek candidates who are
enthusiastic about evolutionary biology, travelling and
living abroad, learning in a multidisciplinary research
environment and working in teams. All appointments
will be for 3 years, YR are oﬀered PhD positions, ER
post-doc positions. YR will be expected to obtain a
PhD at the end of the project. The application of fe-
male candidates is especially encouraged; detailed in-
formation on child care facilities at the diﬀerent in-
stitutions will be provided upon request. Aid can be
sought if accompanying spouses also require employ-
ment abroad. Project overview: Sex is the queen of
evolutionary problems. It will be tackled by SEXA-
SEX in a multidisciplinary approach, providing train-
ing and transfer of knowledge for a total of 360 person-
months. 10 network researchers (6 young researchers
(YR) and 4 experienced researchers (ER)) will receive
training in 9 institutions across as many countries. A
wide array of research tools will provide excellent train-
ing opportunities, for example through individual ca-
reer development plans, individual tutoring and sec-
ondments, which will be supplemented by participa-
tion in courses and external workshops. Network-wide
training will exploit the extensive experience of the
partner institutions through ﬁve courses and summer
schools for all network researchers. Complementary
skills such as management and communication (ver-
bal, written) will be developed, and gender awareness
will be raised, in two network-wide meetings. The net-
works theoretical and empirical research will apply 13
major approaches, including novel genomic and kary-
ological approaches, intraspeciﬁc phylogeography, ecol-
ogy, behavioural studies, GIS analyses and theoretical
modelling. With this multidisciplinary toolkit, SEX-
ASEX will investigate why sex exists at all, given its
evolutionary costs, using the model organism Eucypris6 EvolDir September 1, 2004
virens, a non-marine ostracod species with both sex-
ual and asexual reproduction. What determines its
gender, what are the genomic consequences of long-
term asexuality, what is the cohesiveness of a species
with mixed reproduction, how do asexuals and sexu-
als compete and what is their historical zoogeography?
The pluralistic approach of SEXASEX is unique and
timely, using highly novel methodologies and dealing
with cutting edge science based on European excellence
and tradition. If you are interested, please contact Dr
Isa Schoen, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences,

UnivKwaZulu-Natal Micros2 MSc Studentships: Genetic markers to tackle illegal
trade in wildlife
2 MSc studentships are available (eligible to South
African Nationals only) at the University of KwaZulu-
Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South African.
The aim of the studentships are to develop microsatel-
lite markers for two species identiﬁed as currently
threatened by the illegal trade (Cape Parrot and Blue
Crane). The two students will be based at the Univer-
sity of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg but will spend
up to 6 months at a the University of Sheﬃeld in the UK
learning the techiques required to develop microsatel-
lites. Returning to the University of KwaZulu-Natal,
Pietermaritzburg, to analyse and apply the markers.
The illegal trade in wildlife threatens a number of South
Africa’s species. It is often diﬃcult for the authorities
to provide the conclusive evidence, required for success-
ful prosecutions, to prove an animal has been illegally
removed from the wild. Genetic techniques oﬀer the po-
tential for conclusive evidence to be provided to assist
such prosecutions.
Applications are invited from suitably qualiﬁed South
African students. Applicants should hold a good hon-
ours degree, ideally have studied molecular and popu-
lation genetics theory at undergraduate level and have
had some previous experience working within a labora-
tory environment. Please apply electronically (if possi-
ble) forwarding a letter of motivation with a CV, state-
ment of your research interests and experience (includ-
ing subjects studied at undergrad/honours with grades
and laboratory experience). Plus contact information
(including email addresses) for three referees.
Please send applications and/or queries (preferably by
email) to: Dr Tiawanna Taylor, School of Botany
and Zoology, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermar-
itzburg, 3209. Email: 201512493@ukzn.ac.za Fax: +27

We expect to make multiple hires from this search, and
at least one of them will probably be in evolutionary
biology. The hires are part of a major, ongoing expan-
sion of the department, and the infusion of new faculty
makes the academic environment in Biology particu-
larly exciting right now. Also, Texas A&M is a great
place to study evolution, because a fairly large number
of individuals housed in multiple academic departments
on campus are interested in evolutionary issues.
Best wishes, Adam G. Jones

The U.S. Geological Survey, Leetown Science Center
(LSC), Aquatic Ecology Branch (Kearneysville, West
Virginia), has advertised the permanent position of Re-
search Geneticist (GS-12/13; Salary range: $60,638 to
$93,742). The ideal candidate would specialize in func-
tional genomics and its applications to ecological issues
(i.e., ecological genomics). The selectee will preform
the following duties:
–Plan, design and conduct biological research in the
areas of genomics, population genetics, and recovery of
declining species, with emphasis on aquatic systems.
–Develop techniques to identify and investigate the
function and expression of ecologically important genes
in species in need of conservation.
–Identify important genetic adaptations to changing en-
vironments, and relate population trends to ecological
processes, including human interactions.
–Coordinate research work with other federal, state,
and academic and private biologists, ecologists, and
natural resource managers to identify needed research
and plan, organize, execute and report the research re-
sults.
The successful applicant is expected to identify and in-
vestigate the function and expression of ecologically
important genes in species in need of conservation.
The scientist will apply genomics investigations to on-
going studies in population genetics, phylogeography,
and molecular systematics currently conducted by the
Branch. The scientist will also interact with ecologists
in the Aquatic Ecology Branch, and with microbial ge-
neticists, molecular biologists, and others at LSC. This
interaction is expected to shed light on the relationship
between genotypes and phenotypes by understanding
the associated genetic and environmental interactions
that aﬀect individual ﬁtness. Another line of produc-
tive research could extrapolate organismal biology topopulation and species evolution to test how regula-
tory gene networks evolve and how they diﬀer among
closely related species (i.e., comparative genomics).

Hello EvolDir
I have developed a simple interface to be used with
ModelTest (by David Posada) called MTgui 0.1. This
program works in Windows and Linux (the latter is still
not available - I will update it in the next few days) and
requires ModelTest 3.5 installed in the machine.
It can be downloaded on
http://evol.mcmaster.ca/paulo/mtgui.php It was
tested with some score ﬁles only, so any errors and prob-
lems please send me an email and I will try to solve it
quickly. A simple htm help ﬁle is included, but I believe
is quite user-friendly.
If you want the source code, drop me a note. It was
developed in C++ with wxWidgets.

Methylation PCR
Dear all
Two years ago I sent a query to the evoldir list regarding
the inﬂuence of DNA methylation on PCR eﬃciency No
clear tendency emerged at that time but several persons
seemed interested by this issue.
A little more is known and has been published recently:
De Meeˆ us T., Humair P.F., Delaye C., Grunau C. andRenaud F. 2004. Non-Mendelian transmission of alle-
les at microsatellite loci: an example in Ixodes ricinus,
the vector of Lyme disease. International Journal for
Parasitology 34: 943-950.
Methylation does not seem to alter PCR ampliﬁcation
(methylated DNA and unmethylated DNA are ampli-
ﬁed as eﬃciently). We however did not test the per-
formance of DNA ampliﬁcation in heterozygous indi-
viduals (heterozygous for methylation and/or for allele
size) and we still have no explanation for the short allele
dominance that we observed at one locus in I. ricinus
(see also Wattier, R., Engel, C.R., Saumitou-Laprade,
P., Valero, M., 1998. Short allele dominance as a source
of heterozygote deﬁciency at microsatellite loci: exper-
imental evidence at the dinucleotide locus nGvCT in
Gracilaria gracilis (Rhodophyta). Mol. Ecol. 7, 1569-

Thus some things obviously remain to be tested to un-
derstand why short allele dominance occur in what kind
of locus.
I hope this will be of some help

Molecular clock
Dear EvolDir members,
I have two queries regarding molecular clock issues and
would greatly appreciate your feedback:
1) One of the most common way to test for the molec-
ular clock is by using a LRT of non-clock and clock
enforced trees. Looking at several articles it seems to
me that the way a ML clock enforced tree is obtainedSeptember 1, 2004 EvolDir 23
diﬀers. (a) some people use their ML non-clock tree and
re-estimate the likelihood of that tree under a molecu-
lar clock enforced, whereas (b) others re-run the entire
ML search under the clock constraint. My own obser-
vation is that (b) gives better likelihood scores than
(a). The consequence may be that using a LRT un-
der (a) the the clock might be rejected, whereas under
(b) not. My question would be if (a) is an appropriate
way to test the molecular clock? Do the LRT and the
Langley-Fitch (as implemented in r8s) method give the
same results?
2) When the molecular clock is rejected methods that
implement relaxed clock assumptions such as NPRS or
PL can be used to reconstruct a chronogram. What is
wrong in using these algorithms also to reconstruct a
chronogram from a clock-like tree? I would think that
the rate smoothing needed would just be very small
compared to a non-clock like tree. Are there studies on
that? The reason for my question are computational
limitations that prevent me for constructing ML clock
trees with method (b).
Thank you very much in advance for your kind help
and suggestions. With my best wishes, Lukas

Morphometrics setup
Hi, I am writing to solicit recomendations on software
and cameras for a morphometrics setup to measure in-
sect body parts. We are considering using Image J soft-
ware in conjunction with a Scion CFW-1310 camera.
Does anyone have experience with this combination?
Alternatively, does anyone have recommendations re-
garding alternative combinations that have worked well
for them in the past?
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!!

NHGRI BAClibrary
CONTINUATION OF NIH BACTERIAL ARTIFI-
CIAL CHROMOSOME (BAC) LIBRARY PRODUC-
TION PROGRAM - REQUEST FOR INFORMA-
TION
RELEASE DATE: August 12, 2004
NOTICE: NOT-HG-04-003
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
(<http://www.genome.gov >)
Purpose: The NHGRI is currently assessing the future
of the genomic BAC library production program that
is part of the NIH BAC Resource Network ( <http:/-
/genome.gov/10001844 >) and is, therefore, requesting
information from researchers about their awareness of
the program, research for which BAC libraries produced
through the program have been used, utility of genomic
BAC libraries in general, and assessment of future needs
for BAC libraries.
Background: The bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome
(BAC) is a vector system of choice for the construc-
tion of the large-insert chromosomal DNA libraries that
are needed in genomic studies. The BAC cloning sys-
tem is more stable than other cloning systems and al-
lows the isolation of genomic DNA fragments that are
large enough (80 to >200 kilobases [kb]) to be useful for
both targeted genomic sequence determination and for
a variety of functional studies. In 2002, three centers
were funded for three years ( <http://grants.nih.gov/-
grants/guide/rfa-ﬁles/RFA-HG-01-002.html >) to pro-
duce genomic BAC libraries from multiple organisms
and to increase the national capacity for BAC library
construction. Both of these goals have been met.
The centers were funded as a production capacity with-
out any decisions of particular organisms (excluding eu-
bacteria, archea and plants) for which to make BAC24 EvolDir September 1, 2004
libraries. In order to optimally select organisms, the
research community was asked to propose species and
present a rationale for library construction. Organisms
were then chosen based on criteria such as medical rele-
vance and uses for which the BAC library would be put.
Through this process 86 organisms have entered the li-
brary production pipeline. Library quality is continu-
ously assessed using a standard set of criteria ( <http:/-
/genome.gov/10001738 >) including average insert size
and depth of genome coverage. The libraries are
also screened for contamination. Libraries are cur-
rently available for 36 species ( <http://genome.gov/-
10001852 >).
Information Requested: This Request for Information
is an attempt to solicit information from the scientiﬁc
community to better assess the need for future BAC
libraries. Information in the following areas will aid in
planning future BAC library construction capacity:
1) Are you aware of the existence of this program and
the opportunity for researchers to propose organisms
for BAC library production? If so, have you contributed
to a white paper proposing an organism? Would you
consider doing so in the future?
2) Have you used a BAC clone or library (generated
through this program or otherwise) in the course of
your research? If so, what was the source and quality
of the library and can you please brieﬂy describe how
it was used? Did it facilitate your research and if so,
how?
3) Are there still unmet needs for BAC libraries? If
yes, please list the organisms for which you would like
to have BAC libraries constructed and state why these
organisms are important to study.
This Request for Information is for information and
planning purposes only and shall not be construed as
a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the
NHGRI. The NHGRI does not intend to award a grant
or contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay
for the preparation of any information submitted or
the Government’s use of such information. Acknowl-
edgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor
will respondents be notiﬁed of the Institute’s evalua-
tion of the information received. Responses will be held

NeiLeiDistances
Dear Colleagues,
I emailed PAUP tech support and the Paup Forum and
did not get a response so I’ll try posting my question
here.
I am using PAUP with AFLP fragment data from Carex
spp to create a consensus tree with bootstrap and a
neighbor joining tree. I am using the Nei-Li index
for a distance measure. The distance measure PAUP
gives me diﬀers greatly from what I’ve calculated in
NTsysPC and, for a few samples, by-hand. I ﬁrst no-
ticed the diﬀerence when I compared NJ trees from
PAUP vs. NTsys and then compared the numbers in
the distance matrices. Am I using the proper syntax
(below) in the nexus ﬁle? Or is there an extra cal-
culation that happens in PAUP to create the distance
matrix?

Thank-you in advance for you help, Chad Kirschbaum

Software BEAST v1 1
A new version of BEAST is now available from the
BEAST website:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/ BEAST is a cross-
platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of
molecular sequences. It can be used for many things
including:
* estimating population size * estimating changes in
population size through time (including bottlenecks) *
estimating divergence times * estimating evolutionary
rates * analyzing time-stamped data such as virusesSeptember 1, 2004 EvolDir 25
and ancient DNA * reconstructing trees under the as-
sumption of a molecular clock
Its main focus is testing evolutionary hypotheses with-
out conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses
MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is
weighted proportional to its posterior probability.
Amongst the new features in version 1.1 are the follow-
ing:
* An auto-optimize function that removes the need to
perform manual tuning of operators. * Improvement
in speed of likelihood calculations for nucleotides. *
Now includes BEAUti as part of the BEAST package.
BEAUti itself has numerous improvements including
new models and options. You can also save the BEAUti
settings as separate ﬁles for later reloading and modiﬁ-
cation.
We have also produced a Mac OS X version that has
proper OS X applications (although the UNIX version
will still work on Mac OS X). The Windows version also
now has native Windows applications (.exe ﬁles) to run
BEAST and BEAUti.
We have also created a new on-line help website:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/help/ This contains
tutorials, documentation and FAQ. There is also a sec-
tion of the website where users can contribute informa-
tion, ask questions and the like.
The Tracer package for analysing BEAST output was
also recently updated:

Taxon sampling
Dear EvolDir members,
Can someone come up with an appropriate way how
to measure non-random taxon sampling? Consider
we are dealing with a family containing four genera
(100/100/10/10 spp, respectively)
1) If we sample 10/10/1/1 or 50/50/5/5 spp, we wouldhave represented the taxonomic diversity randomly 2)
If we sample 30/30/1/1 we have the species rich gen-
era over represented (underdispersed sampling) 3) If we
sample 10/10/10/10 we have the species poor genera
over represented (overdispersed sampling)
I am looking for an index to illustrate the degree of
non-random sampling that also distinguishes between
under- and over dispersed sampling e.g. 1) should give
a value of one, 2) should give a value smaller than one,
and 3) should give a value bigger than one.
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. With my
best wishes in the meantime, Lukas

Tetraploid micros answers
Dear Evoldir,
Here are the responses I got for the questions regarding
tetraploid microsatellite problem, which I posted in the
forum about a month ago.I got some useful suggestions
but in my opinion the problem is not yet completely
solved. I am very much thankful to all of you who re-
sponded my question.
The question I posted was as following:
Dear evoldir,
I am a Ph.D. student in forest genetics and working
with a forest tree species called sycamore (Acer pseu-
doplatanus) which is a tetraploid species. I am using
nuclear microsatellite marker to study the genetic struc-
ture of above mentioned species. Since the species is
tetraploid I am getting 1 to 4 bands per locus per sam-
ple and to score alleles depending on dosage eﬀects is
not working (diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate alleles). I am get-
ting diﬃculties to interprate such types of bands. I
would be grateful if anyone can suggest me how to in-
terprate such types of bands and what types genetic
variation parameter can be estimated from such types
of data using which programme.
ANSWERS:26 EvolDir September 1, 2004
I already noticed your post at the EvolDir, but did not
reply as I was a bit short on time and thought that
others might also be able to help you. However, if you
did not yet get the answers you needed, I can help you
by giving my view on your problem.
It was nice of Ruzica to suggest my program to you,
but I am afraid it might not entirely what you are
looking for, though it might be of use, depending on
your research question. My program is in priciple
meant for use with asexually reproducing species, and
as most asexuals are polyploid, the program can han-
dle polyploid data. Most of the program’s function-
ality is rather useless if you are working on a sexual
species. However, the program does allow you to cal-
culate and export genetic distance matrices (also using
Ruzica’s method). You can use this matrix then to
make a tree (eg. UPGMA) and draw some conclusions
from that or to do other things that people usually do
with genetic distances. You can ﬁnd the program on
www.science.uva.nl/ ˜ meirmans . More useful hoew-
ever would be to forget about my program and do an
Amova. In that case you might score your msats as
if they were dominant markers and use these as an
input ﬁle. Someone called JENCZEWSKI published
something Amova’s on polyploids in Molecular Ecol-
ogy in 1999, if I remember correctly, but those were on
RAPDs. If you do want to use your data asd codomi-
nant, you would have to think of a way to calculate a
chi-square distance matrix for your data to use as an
input.
Furthermore there is the excellent program called
SPAGEDI, written by Olivier Hardy, that can calcu-
late Fst using polyploid data. However the bias that
arises from not knowing the dosage of your alleles is
hard to asses, though I know people who have done Fst
calculations on data from polyploids like that.
Just out of interest: are all A. pseudoplatanus polyploid
or are there also diploids somewhere? And something
that has been b ugging me for quite sometime: is poly-
ploidy as frequent in trees as it is in herbs? I never
before heard of polyploid trees, though I never took
the eﬀort to look for it...
Hope I have helped you with this, if you have any fur-
ther questions, don’t hesitate to ask.

Hi,
The short answer is:
“There is no standard approach to population genetic
stats in a polysomically inheriting polyploid in which
you can’t identify allele dosage. The is certainly no
software to do so.”
However,
If you can score allele dosage, then use Spagedi (Hardy
and vekemans)
If it has disomic inheritance, then I have an approach
(and a beta of a text-interface program) that will give
some statistics.
My program will work with a polyploid with polysomic
inheritance (i.e. give you numbers), but inference would
be harder.
I have attached the (very ’beta’) doumentation for my
program. Included are some helpful references.

I had exactly the same problem when I scored microstel-
lites in a tetraploid Echium vulgare. I did not trust the
estimation of number of copies of the alleles, based on
the signal intensity. I ended up noting only the pres-
ence or absence of ampliﬁed alleles. I wrote it in my
primer note. Korbecka G, Vrieling K, Squirrell J, et al.

TexasAMU Seahorses
A POSTDOCTORAL POSITION in molecular evolu-
tionary biology is available in the laboratory of Adam
G. Jones at Texas A&M University. The candidate
for this position will be expected to contribute to one
or both of two major research foci in the laboratory.September 1, 2004 EvolDir 31
The ﬁrst area of interest involves the use of the phe-
nomenon of male pregnancy in the ﬁsh Family Syng-
nathidae (pipeﬁshes, seahorses and sea dragons) as a
model to understand the evolution of morphological in-
novations. The male’s brood pouch is a novel evolution-
ary structure and it has evolved in parallel in two sepa-
rate syngnathid lineages. The goal is to use microarrays
and other genomics techniques to investigate the evolu-
tion of the genes and genetic pathways involved in male
pregnancy. The second research area comprises sexual
selection and gamete competition in syngnathids. Male
pregnancy results in a reversal in the direction of sexual
selection in some pipeﬁsh, which provides unique oppor-
tunities to study gamete competition and cryptic choice
(with males rather than females choosing). These stud-
ies involve a combination of laboratory-based mating
experiments and microsatellite-based parentage analy-
sis.
The start date is ﬂexible, and funding is available for
at least two years. The salary will be competitive. In-
terested individuals should send a C.V., a brief letter
(or email) indicating interest, and contact information
for 3 references to Adam Jones. Email submissions are

Academic-related Research Staﬀ Grade 1A: Salary
£19,460 - £29,128
Two postdoctoral research positions of three years du-
ration in Bioinformatics funded by BBSRC are avail-
able for working with Jotun Hein. This project will
focus on models of sequence evolution that includes a
process of insertion-deletion of nucleotides and their im-
plementation. Furthermore, developed methods will be
applied to complete genomes as they are determined
in coming years. The work will include algorithm de-
velopment, statistical modelling, software development
and large scale comparative analysis of genomes. The
research will take place at The Oxford Centre for Gene
Function. Earliest starting date is 1st November 2004.
The Research Project: Practical Statistical Alignment.
Although bioinformatics perceived is a new discipline,
certain parts have a long history and could be viewed
as classical bioinformatics. For example, application
of string comparison algorithms to sequence alignment
has a history spanning the last three decades. The prin-
ciple of choosing solutions by minimizing the amount
of evolution is also called parsimony and has been
widespread in phylogenetic analysis even if there is no
alignment problem. Over the last two decades the
parsimony method of phylogenetic reconstruction has
been severely criticized and has lost terrain to methods
based on stochastic modelling of nucleotides, codons
or amino acids. The present project will develop, im-
plement and simultaneously apply methods including
insertion-deletions of nucleotides/amino acids to give
a full model of sequence evolution. At present there
are only 2 techniques that can solve these problems -34 EvolDir September 1, 2004
dynamic programming and MCMC - so that is where
our focus lies. We are shifting emphasis from the for-
mer to the later; however, this does not mean dynamic
programming will be without value. Dynamic program-
ming provides exact solution and MCMC provides only
approximation. The former can be used to test the va-
lidity of the later on small data sets. The key goals of
this project are:
i. Software package: A central aim of the project is to
develop a package doing Bayesian statistical alignment
for many sequences and performs a series of essential
associated analyses: hypothesis testing for molecular
clock, phylogeny, mutation rate, selection estimation,
assessing ancestral sequences, and structure prediction.
It should produce nice graphical outputs of diﬀerent
marginalisation (tree, alignment, structure, ancestral
sequences, and posterior distribution of mutation rates)
for easy visualization. Prior parameters will be allowed
to be set by users. This package of easy to use, biologist-
friendly software should be of wide use in the commu-
nity. A web based server will be developed that re-
searchers can submit jobs to.
ii. Development of better biological models and cor-
responding algorithms: The TKF91 model allows only
single insertions and deletions which is biologically ir-
relevant. Modelling long insertions and deletions is nec-
essary to make statistical alignment practical. Site het-
erogeneity and residue-dependent indel rates would also
increase the strength of the method.
iii. Structure prediction: Most of the comparative
structure prediction methods are based on alignments,
which might be misleading when the alignment is
wrong. Statistical alignment will improve this.
iv. Comparative genomics: At present the capabili-
ties of our statistical alignment methods matches the
growth of mammalian genomes. Several questions are
of interest here. Since statistical alignment is based on
a general model of molecular evolution including both
insertions and deletions, issues related to the nature
of these events can be addressed and parameterized.
What is the nature of insertions and deletions, their
length distribution and rates? There is no reason to as-
sume that insertion process is the time reversed process
of deletion as assumed by many models. Quantifying
the departure from this assumption would be of great
interest. The removal of the intermediate alignment
step makes statistical alignment very suited for large
scale genomic analysis and question such as departure
from the molecular clock and time reversibility of the
underlying substitution process can be tested. A good
model of neutral molecular evolution also increases the
power to detect selection which is central in functionalinterpretation of individual genes. An especially inter-
esting question at present is the enigma of the amount
of selection outside genes.
The Appointments Applications for the PDRA posts
are invited from researchers interested in working on
this high-impact project - the development of statisti-
cal models, software and the analysis of genomic data.
Candidates should have relevant background and re-
search experience in computer

P.I.’s: Dr. Rhonda R Snook, University of Sheﬃeld,
and Prof. Allen Moore, University of Manchester
A postdoctoral position is available to join a NERC-
funded project examining the consequences of mating
system structure on genetic architecture and reproduc-
tive isolation in Drosophila pseudoobscura. We are cur-
rently involved in an experimental evolution study in
which we have manipulated the mating system of this
naturally promiscuous species, by enforcing monogamy
and elevating promiscuity. These selection lines are be-
ing used to elucidate the adaptive signiﬁcance of sperm
heteromorphism (production of multiple sperm types
within a male) and the nature of sexual conﬂict in this
species.
We seek to complement these studies by quantifying
how mating system evolution inﬂuences the genetic ar-
chitecture of morphology and behavioural traits that
are relevant to reproductive success. This component
of the research will employ a quantitative genetics ap-
proach using a half-sib design to calculate additive ge-
netic (co)variances within and between the sexes and
to determine the relationship to mating system. We
will also determine the role of sexual selection and sex-
ual conﬂict in promoting reproductive isolation by ex-
amining pre- and post-copulatory success between and
within the selection lines having diﬀerent mating sys-
tems. The project will also take into account any eﬀects
of inbreeding by characterizing the eﬀect of selection on
genetic diversity using molecular markers.
The Evolution and Behaviour group at Sheﬃeld has
been at the forefront of several recent developments
in evolutionary and behavioural ecology, including the
integration of mechanistic and functional approaches.
The postdoc would interact with this large group. Ad-
ditional interaction would occur with the Integrative
Animal Biology group at the University of Manchester,
members of which are experts in quantitative genetics.36 EvolDir September 1, 2004
Candidate requirements:
The desired candidate will have a strong background in
evolution, preferably quantitative behavioural genetics.
Applicants with experience in one ore more of the fol-
lowing will be preferred: microscopy, measurement and
dissection techniques; the use of microsatellites. Expe-
rience in Drosophila culturing is helpful but not essen-
tial. The project is based in Sheﬃeld and will require
some weekend work.

land Antilles) learning to do ﬁeld research. This gradu-
ate course is open to seniors with adequate background
coursework (see list of pre-requisites). It will consist of
5 modules taught by diferent faculty, and a 3-week pe-
riod at the end for students to focus on their individual
research projects. Undergraduates can concurrently en-
roll in BIO 480 Field Biology for an additional 6 credits
to be fully enrolled (12 credits). Diving certiﬁcation is
required. The full information about the course, the
syllabus, the cost structure, as well as the applications
forms can be found on my web page [see address in
my signature]. Partial scholarships, and special out-of-
state tuition rates are available to qualiﬁed applicants.
The deadline has been extended to August 30th (on
web page states Aug 15th). Interested students should
contact me immediately.
Thank you for your help in directing this information to
students that might be interested in this new oﬀering.
We are especially interested in attracting minorities and

Drosophila Species Identiﬁcation Workshop October
28-30, 2004, University of Arizona
The fourth annual Drosophila Species Identiﬁcation
Workshop will be held at the University of Arizona,
Tucson, beginning 8:30 AM Thursday October 28. The
workshop lasts three full days and includes participa-
tion during a fourth day in the Drosophila Comparative
Genomics Symposium on Sunday October 31, a dinner
Saturday October 30 at the Arizona Sonoran Desert
Museum, and a traditional Mexican meal at the home
of Therese Markow on Friday October 29.
Workshop participants will be instructed in Drosophila
anatomy and the use of taxonomic keys to identify
Drosophila. Following an overview of the species
in the genus Drosophila, the workshop will focus on
four species groups: melanogaster, obscura, virilis,
and repleta. Participants will also receive instruction
in the preparation and examination of polytene and
metaphase chromosomes. Instructors include Patrick
O’Grady, Bryant McAllister, Therese Markow, Mar-
vin Wasserman, Steve Schaeﬀer, William Heed, Nicolas
Gompel.
Space in the workshop is limited to 12 participants and
it has ﬁlled up quickly in previous years. Those in-
terested in signing up for the workshop should contact
Sharon Richards of the Center for Insect Science, Uni-
versity of Arizona at insects@arl.arizona.edu. The fee
for attending the workshop is $350.

IMAR Institute of Marine Research (DOP-University of
the Azores) is organising the following workshop: “use
of molecular markers for the study of marine biodiver-
sity” from 1-6 September 2004and it will be held in
Horta (Azores).
This workshop is FREE OF CHARGE for students but
please, sort out your ﬂight and accomodation. For fur-
ther informations and applications, please contact Ser-
gio Stefanni at sstefanni@notes.horta.uac.pt
This workshop aims to lead PhD students and young
scientists through traditional and more up-to-date
methodology of analysing molecular data for the study
of marine biodiversity. This subject has become an im-
portant issue in the scientiﬁc community and the use of
molecular tools is of invaluable help. Therefore, with
this workshop, we gather together several world-leading
experts of marine molecular ecology to give a unique
opportunity to students to analyse their own datasets.
Seminars followed by tutorials should make the stu-
dents familiar with the use of designed software’s, and
the variety of subjects presented by the invited speakers
will cover a large spectrum of organisms inhabiting or
associated to the sea. Applicants are strongly advised
to bring their own datasets as they will analyse them
during the workshop. The selection of the candidates is
done to equally ﬁll each of the ﬁelds of expertise: marine
invertebrates (sea urchins, deep sea and hydrothermal
vents), ﬁsh, sea turtles, marine mammals and seabirds.
The structure of the workshop is as follows: In-
troduction to mathematical models and building
trees/networks techniques applied on molecular data
(sequences and microsatellites) Practical exercises on
specially prepared datasets for the students. Daily sem-
inars with practicals on the diﬀerent group of marine
or sea associated organisms. Small groups of students,
divided according to type of molecular markers used
in their projects, with the aim of analysing their own
datasets under the supervision of the related ﬁeld ex-
perts. Presentation of students’ work based on elabo-
ration of their own datasets is expected to conclude the
workshop.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords40 EvolDir September 1, 2004
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
