ConGen 2020 Online: Population Genomics, Conserva-
tion Genetics & Data Analysis Workshop
Theme: New this year is slightly more focus on
genome sequencing, assembly, and re-sequencing of
whole genomes to prepare participants and instructorsfor the future which will involve far more whole-genome
data production and analyses.
Instructors: Craig Primmer, Maren Wellenreuther, Eric
Anderson, Chris Funk, Brian Hand, Paul Hohenlohe,
Marty Kardos, Brenna Forester, Joanna Kelley, Gordon
Luikart, Mike Miller, Rena Schweizer, Amanda Stahlke,
Robin Waples, and more TBA.
When: September 7-18, 2020
Where: Online due to Covid-19
For details on ConGen-2020: see http://www.umt.edu/-
ces/conferences/congen/ Course Objective: The goal
of ConGen is to provide training in conceptual and
practical aspects of data analysis to understand the
evolutionary and ecological genomics of natural and
managed populations.
Emphasis will be on next-generation sequence (NGS)
data analysis (RADs, DNA capture, and whole-genome
sequence analyses, and gene expression) and inter-
pretation of output from recent novel statistical ap-
proaches and software programs. The course pro-
motes interactions among early-career researchers (stu-
dents/participants) and leaders in population genomics
to help develop the \next generation" of conservation
and evolutionary geneticists. We will identify and dis-
cuss developments needed to improve data analysis ap-
proaches.
This course will cover analysis methods including the
coalescent, Bayesian, and likelihood-based approaches.July 1, 2020 EvolDir 3
Special lecture sessions and hands-on exercises will be
conducted on population structure, detecting selection,
and genetic monitoring (of Ne, FST, etc.), landscape
genomics, inbreeding detection (RoH), GWAS to iden-
tify adaptive loci, genomic vulnerability assessment and
more. It will also include lectures and hands-on activ-
ities on gene expression mechanisms underlying rapid
adaptation to environmental change.
Who should apply: Advanced Undergrads, M.S. & Ph.D.
students, post-docs, faculty, agency researchers, and pop-
ulation biologists that have taken at least one university-
level course in population genetics and a course in pop-
ulation ecology. Priority will be given to persons with
their own NGS data to analyze and/or experience ana-
lyzing NGS data.
Registration & Cost: The cost to participate in ConGen
2020 is $790 US if you pay before July 1st or $850 US if
you pay after July 1st. This includes lectures (live and
recorded) by 12 expert instructors, question & answer
sessions (live and recorded), question and answer ses-
sions, copies of all lecture PowerPoint slides, hands-on
exercise work sheets with dummy datasets, along with
ConGen-2020 Swag (T-shirt, mug). Course materials
will remain available for many months after the end of
the course to all students in a box repository including
all recorded lectures. Scholarships are available based
on availability and nancial need.
Participants will also receive advice installing programs
through multiple online help session and also through
tutorials and email. Students with PC can receive help
installing a Linux virtual machine on their PC in the
weeks BEFORE the course. Linux line commands will
be used for several analyses during the course. A brief
tutorial on Linux will be given the rst day for those
interested in learning Linux line commands important
for population genomics data analysis.
The course will be Online this year using Zoom along
with a static forum/blog for writing questions to and
getting answers from instructors (during and after each
lecture). Participants outside North American time
zones (e.g., Europe, Australasia) can watch recorded
lectures (if they cannot participate live) after lectures
are given and still participate in Q & A sessions and
blogs within a few days after each lecture. Because all
lectures and hands-on sessions are recorded (in Zoom),
participants can watch (or re-watch) them the next day
and still ask questions and get instructor feedback (via
the blog or live).
This course is sponsored by the American Genetic As-
sociation, the Journal of Heredity, NASA (the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration), NSF (the Di-
mensions in Biodiversity program), along with PacBio,DoveTail Genomics, support from publications such as
eDNA, Evolutionary Applications, Conservation Genet-
ics and more TBA. It includes 12 expert instructors
and hands-on data analysis using your data (with in-
structors) and dummy data sets provided by instructors.
It has led to publications describing main topics and
outcomes of the course in past years, with the goal
of facilitating data analysis for population geneticists
worldwide.

Two PhD positions are open in my research group. Be-
low is a summary of the projects.
Two PhD positions are available at Aalborg and Aarhus
University in Denmark within production of high quality
protein for food and feed based on insects. The project
involve topics such as screening insect species and diet
types to detect species with high potential for produc-
tion of protein, develop a sustainable breeding program

InsectMicrobiomes
Ph.D. Student position: The diversity and evolution
of hemipteran symbioses at Jagiellonian University in
Krak ow, Poland
The Symbiosis Evolution Research Group
(www.symbio.eko.uj.edu.pl) at the Institute of
Environmental Sciences of Jagiellonian University
(www.eko.uj.edu.pl) is seeking a motivated Ph.D.
Student to join the project focused on the evolution-
ary dynamics of heritable nutritional symbionts of
hemipteran insects.
We aim to systematically describe the evolution of mi-
crobial symbioses of hemipteran insects from the sub-
order Auchenorrhyncha. For about 300 million years,
these insects, including cicadas, spittlebugs, leafhop-
pers, treehoppers, and planthoppers, have specialized
on nutrient-poor diet of plant sap thanks to nutritional
contributions of specialized microbial symbionts that
live in their tissues. These symbionts have been strictly
heritable, transmitting from mothers to ospring for a
long time, often for hundreds of millions of years, and
losing up to ~98% of their genome during that time.
But in many host clades, some of them were replaced
or complemented by other microorganisms. We are
describing the incidence and nature of these symbiont
replacements, the origins of the replacing microbes, their
genomic evolutionary patterns, their current biological
roles, and the eects of the replacements on the ecology
and evolution of the insects.
The Ph.D. Student will focus on bioinformatic recon-
struction of the symbiont co-diversication and replace-
ment patterns, and on phylogenomic analyses of the
host and symbiont relationships. Depending on skills
and interests, they will have an opportunity to par-
ticipate in international eldwork, work with collected
insects, conduct laboratory experiments, conduct molec-
ular work (automated DNA extraction, next-generation
sequencing library preparation), comparative genomics,
and advanced microscopy. The system provides greatpotential for a dedicated student to explore their own
ideas and evolutionary questions related to insect sym-
bioses, and acquire cutting-edge research skills. The
Student will be encouraged to work closely with project
collaborators, including Gordon Bennett (University of
California - Merced), Insect Biome Atlas consortium
members in Sweden and Madagascar, and Anna Micha-
lik (Jagiellonian University).
The Student will join a dynamic, collaborative, multi-
lingual group established recently at one of the top
research institutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolu-
tion in Central Europe, in a medieval city known as the
cultural capital of Poland, with good access to outdoor
recreation opportunities and well-connected to the rest
of Europe. The student will be supported by a generous
48-month tax-free stipend from the Ph.D. Program in
Biology at Jagiellonian University and/or the Polish Na-
tional Science Center grant, ensuring a good standard
of living in Krak ow. Ambitious Ph.D. Students will be
encouraged and supported in applications for additional
stipends and research grants. The ocial start date of
the Ph.D. Program is October 1st, 2020, but there may
be exibility.
The successful candidate will have an M.Sc. degree
in a relevant eld by September 2020; a demonstrated
interest in Evolution, Entomology, Microbiology, and/or
Genomics; experience with, or a keen interest in learning,
Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology; and strong
English language, communication, and organizational
skills. Previous experience with insect diversity, ecology,
evolution and symbioses, molecular biology, microbiome
surveys, phylogenomics and/or comparative genomics,
and willingness to travel are advantageous.
The applicants should send a cover letter, a CV, and the
details of two references to the principal investigator,
Dr. Piotr Lukasik (p.lukasik@uj.edu.pl). The review
of applications starts on 1st July 2020. The selected
candidates will be invited to apply for a place in the
Ph.D. Program in Biology at Jagiellonian University
(https://wb.uj.edu.pl/studia/phd-biology). Also, one
candidate will be selected as the doctoral stipend recipi-
ent. More details are provided in the extended version of
the advert at the group website (symbio.eko.uj.edu.pl)

3-year PhD position on the eect of seasonal reversible
brain size changes on cognitive abilities of common
shrews in a collaborative Human Frontiers-funded
project on the causes and consequences of Dehnels Phe-
nomenon.
In our long-term project on the evolution of reversible
individual size changes in small high-metabolic mam-
mals we are lling a position for a 3-year PhD starting
as soon as possible. The common shrew is unique in
that juveniles reach a rst maximum size, then shrink
towards winter, including a size reduction of up to 25
% of the brain, followed by a regrowth in the following
spring along with sexual maturation. This is thought
to be an energy saving strategy, resulting in lower food
requirements in the winter (as these tiny shrews don't
hibernate and constantly need to eat high quality food),
which we have conrmed with a rst metabolic study at
ambient conditions. We have followed the size change
for the rst time in the individual, have described how
brain regions change as well as shown that the brain
size reduction results in decreased spatial navigation
skills. We are starting to keep shrews in large outdoor
enclosures and you would use a combined approach
of repeated state-of-the-art MRI imaging and behav-
ioral assays of the same individuals as they go through
the cycle. The MRIs will be with Dominik von Elver-
feldt in nearby Freiburg, where you will spend part of
your time (https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/mr-en/-
members/current/elverfeldt.html).
This is a HSFP-funded collaborative project with Lil-
iana Davalos from Stony Brook University (looking
at the molecular basis of this phenomenon) and John
Nieland from Aalborg University (looking at the lipid
metabolism) and their students.
The Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior at its sites
in Konstanz and Radolfzell oers an international, inter-
disciplinary and collaborative environment that opens
up unique research opportunities. The goal of our basic
research is to develop a quantitative and predictive un-
derstanding of the decisions and movements of animals
in their natural environment.
What we are looking for:If you are fascinated by evolution and questions such
as how seasonal change aects animals, how the brain
is shaped by evolutionary pressure, or how brain size
is linked to behavior and cognitive abilities, this may
be the right position for you. This project has already
started and as the cycle of size change starts in June,
we are interested to ll the position asap. You will be
encouraged to provide input with regards to where you
want to take the project within the given framework.
Field work, although not very strenuous, is necessary,
including setting and checking traps year-round at all
hours. Some behavioural observations may also run
for several hours and may have to be carried out dur-
ing evenings and weekends. Ideally you are a biologist
with also a background in or inclination for physics or
bioimaging as the MRI (which we will be the rst to do
with shrews) will be a large and important part of the
project. Good English skills are also a requirement. You
must have a drivers' license and A FELASA certicate
for handling of laboratory animals or equivalent would
be great. Experience with handling small animals is
expected. Even though for your project no animals need
to be sacriced, we expect you to help when shrews are
sampled for the associated genomics project, i.e. you
need to be willing to be present (but not euthanize
yourself) and help with the sampling. A master degree
is required.
What you will nd:
The Dechmann Lab works on several projects with small
high-metabolic mammals, all focusing on how animals
have evolved to deal with changing resource landscapes.
Our group has been working on these shrews for years,
working out many (but never all) of the potential kinks
of working with the sensitive shrews. As an institute we
oer a responsible and varied work place in a growing
interdisciplinary and international research environment.
The payment is made in accordance with the collective
agreement for the public service (TV oD-Bund). Our
graduate school IMPRS for Organismal Biology pro-
vides added background where you can prot from a
large spectrum of courses and support.
The Max Planck Society endeavors to employ more
severely disabled people. Applications of severely dis-
abled persons are expressly welcome. The Max Planck
Society strives for gender and diversity equality. We
welcome applications from all backgrounds.

MPIEVA Leipzig BoneProteomics
Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher position in Palaeo-
proteomics (ESR7, PUSHH)
The Department of Human Evolution at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig (Ger-
many), invites Early Stage Researchers to apply for a
PhD position that is part of the European training Net-
work \PUSHH: Palaeoproteomics to Unleash Studies onHuman History", funded by the European Union's Hori-
zon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant
agreement No 861389). More information on the net-
work and its international partners can be found on the
www.pushh-etn.eu . In the Department of Human Evolu-
tion, palaeoanthropological research is conducted within
a multidisciplinary environment involving biological an-
thropologists, Palaeolithic archaeologists, archaeologi-
cal scientists, and geochronologists. The ESR position
builds on existing expertise within the department on
the analysis of ancient proteomics to address questions
of relevance in palaeoanthropology and archaeology. In
particular, we are looking for highly motivated appli-
cants with an interest in combining palaeoanthropology,
archaeological sciences, and zooarchaeology.
Job description
As part of the PUSHH network, ESR7 will work on
developing and applying a novel proteomic approach
to identify the biological species of archaeological bone
fragments. Palaeoanthropology utilizes peptide mass
ngerprinting to screen sample sets encompassing thou-
sands of bone chips from caves known to be occupied by
anatomically modern humans, Neanderthals and Deniso-
vans to identify hominin remains and further charac-
terise them through deep palaeogenomic sequencing.
Despite being cheap and robust, peptide mass nger-
printing has some clear limitations, because it commonly
uses MALDI-TOF-MS instruments that are less sensi-
tive and have lower resolution compared to what is now
the state-of-the-art proteomics technology, i.e. Orbi-
trap (commercialised by partner organisation Thermo).
Furthermore, peptide mass ngerprinting data interpre-
tation is still manual and as such tedious and error-
prone. ESR7 will apply the same approach based on
data-independent acquisition (DIA) tandem MS and the
ultra-fast peptide separation technology ( ~8 mins/run),
developed by partner organisation EvoSEP, to screen
bone proteomes at low cost with Orbitrap technology.
The advantages over peptide mass ngerprinting will be
represented by the acquisition of a much richer dataset
per sample, higher sensitivity, higher automation, and
the ability to use o-the-shelf spectral identication
software. As a result, the ESR will acquire advanced
laboratory, proteomics, and bioinformatics skills during
the duration of the project. Part of this research will
be accomplished by a secondment to the Centre for Pro-
tein Research, Olsen group, University of Copenhagen
(Denmark).
The ESR will have a signicant amount of freedom in
designing the research project within the scope of the
PUSHH network and the high-throughput screening
of archaeological bone proteomes, supervised by Prof.
Hublin and Dr. Welker. The position commences onJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 17
the 1st of September for 36 months (full time).
Your key tasks will consist of: - Sample selection and
ancient protein extraction; - Protein data analysis, in-
cluding quantication of damage and assigning taxo-
nomic species identity. - Acquire in-depth knowledge of
DIA mass spectrometry data acquisition and associated
bioinformatics. - Integration of palaeproteomic data
with existing chronological, environmental, and zooar-
chaeological datasets for the analyzed archaeological
assemblages.
You will be expected to complete a PhD thesis within
the duration of the position. Due to the composition of
the PUSHH network, there are signicant opportunities
for further training and knowledge-exchange with other
network members. This includes mandatory network-
wide activities that might take place outside of Europe.
Your work will result in scientic articles and/or book
chapters in collaboration with other PUSHH ESRs and
supervisors, and, whenever possible, opportunities will
be sought to communicate your research to a broad
audience. The research is expected to be compliant
with the highest scientic standards, as set out in the
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.
Qualications prole - By September 1st 2020, have a
completed university degree (Ma/MSc) in archaeology,
evolutionary biology, proteomics, or related disciplines.
- Ability to work collaboratively and independently in
relation to multi- disciplinary research teams. - Expe-
rience with bioinformatics and molecular/evolutionary
biology is preferable. - Prociency in English.
Eligibility To be eligible to apply for this role you must,

This PhD project is aimed at investigating the spread
of ancestral body piercing practices in relation to past
human migrations. This is to say that body piercing is
here considered as a vertically transmissible cultural
trait, maybe having a limited number of origins in
time and space. Like other body modications (skull
deformations, teeth alterations, scarications, tattoos,
neck elongation, etc.), body piercing relies on a very
specic and quite complex know-how. Although its
symbolism is variable, diachronically and synchronously,
the practice actually relies on the method used to
create, heal and enlarge a \tunnel" in the esh: when
the know-how is lost, the practice becomes hardly
possible. This is the research hypothesis of the thesis:
The ancestors of the populations who practice(d) body
piercing learned how to do it by contact with other
populations. The history of body piercing is likely
to mirror past human contacts and migrations. To
be clear: This doctoral project concerns ONLY the
study of traditional body piercing practiced by many
peoples in the world, it DOES NOT directly concern
\modern" body piercing emerged in California (the
\Modern Primitives") in the mid-1970s. Nevertheless,
this recent renaissance has shown that several years
have been necessary to develop, ex nihilo, a viable
body piercing technique, meaning that it is not easy
to reinvent body piercing. This is why ancestral
(\traditional") body piercing may have persisted only
where the know-how related to it has been transmitted
through direct learning, generation after generation.
The oldest body piercing ornament is dated 46,000
years ago (Langley et al. 2016). Although other body18 EvolDir July 1, 2020
modications (ex: tattooing) can be as old, body
piercing leaves more durable evidence: the ornaments.
Easily recognizable by their shape (rounded, cylindrical,
conical, or toroidal), their symmetry, weight and
polishing, body piercing ornaments will be the major
object of study of the thesis. Contemporary or old, they
are available in many collections (public or private),
this is why eldwork will not be necessary. The project
stems from an exhibition that took place at the Mus ee
de l'Homme , Paris, France (March 2019/2020; curator
F. Manni) and related work. The candidate will benet
the help of the research network at the origin of the
exhibition (40 researchers, 12 countries: archaeologists,
ethnologists, anthropologists, curators). Currently the
Network is involved in the writing of a manual on
body modications to be published by an international
academic publisher. The outcome of the thesis can be
included in it.
Objectives of the thesis and worksteps Which ones are
the populations practicing or having practiced body
piercing? Where are they located? When was body
piercing invented? How many times was it invented?
How did it spread? None of these issues have been ad-
dressed so far. Although body piercing ornaments are
not uncommon in archaeological excavations, they have
not yet been the subject of systematic attention. At rst,
the PhD student will create a georeferenced database of
the populations practicing (or having practiced) tradi-
tional body piercing. Then, she/he will address the issue
of its spread. The aim is to test if body-piercing trans-
mission relies on independent origins or, rather, on a
vertical transmission in a limited number of populations,
disseminating through their migrations and contacts.
Likely, some of these migrations are known, described
by population geneticists and historical linguists. The
interpretation of the diachronic and synchronic cartog-
raphy of piercing will be based also on them. Studied
ornaments will be classied according to their i) shape,
ii) materiality, iii) manufacturing techniques and iv)
decorations,

PlantEvolutionaryGenomics
A PhD position is available to study adaptive intro-
gression in Poplar with Jill Hamilton at North Dakota
State University, as part of a new NSF Plant Genome-
funded collaboration with Jason Holliday (Virginia
Tech), Stephen Keller (Vermont) and Matt Fitzpatrick
(U of Maryland).
Understanding how interspecic hybridization leads to
the generation of complex adaptive traits across envi-
ronments is a central objective of species management,
particularly considering rapidly changing climates. Nat-
ural Populus hybrid zones provide a 'living laboratory'
to test the impact a long history of natural selection and
weak barriers to reproduction have had on the origins
of adaptations and the maintenance of species barriers.
The graduate student will leverage replicate natural
hybrid zone transects between Populus trichocarpa and
P. balsamifera spanning the Rocky Mountains in con-
junction with modern sequencing (whole-genome rese-
quencing, long and short reads), large common garden
experiments, and novel computational approaches to
study the genomic and phenotypic consequences of hy-
bridization across environments. Broadly this research
will ask: (i) how is introgression arrayed across the
genome and landscape? and (ii) what regions of the
genome contribute to hybrid tness and what are their
environmental drivers? This project will enhance our
understanding of the relationship between adaptive in-
trogression and tness across environments.
The PhD student will be prepared to combine eld-
based research monitoring phenotypic trait variation
across replicated common garden experiments with
whole genome resequencing, and environmental and
spatial data. The ideal graduate student will have some
experience in population genomics and/or quantitative
genetics. There is plenty of room to pursue particular in-
terests in adaptive introgression and the origin of species
barriers depending on the interest and experience of the
candidate. The student will be involved in a range of
outreach activities associated with the project, includ-
ing engaging with collaborator institutions and ArbNet
(based at the Morton Arboretum, Chicago) to develop
educational modules on climate adaptation using Poplar
mini gardens planted across the United States. TheJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 19

3DUK Project Description Many aspects of animal
behaviour dier consistently between individuals and
this has given rise to the growing eld of animal person-
ality. However, this does not mean that the behaviour
of a given individual is readily predictable, because
while some individuals show low levels of variation
around their behavioural mean, others show high levels
of variation. Comparisons between individuals in
stress research often rely on single measurements of
phenotypic traits, which is potentially problematic since
variation in trait predictability between individuals
can render single measurements of labile traits such as
behaviour unreliable as indicators of stress. Using a
combination of large-scale genetical genomics analysis
the candidate will determine the genetic architecture
underlying variation in behavioural predictability
(within-individual variation) across a range of anxiety
related behaviors, as well as the mechanisms underlying
their eect and correlate these predictability genes with
eects of prenatal stress, to see if individuals with genes
that cause low or high trait predictability are more or
less sensitive to environmental disturbance.
The candidate will work with myself Dr Rie Henriksen

UBern GenomicsBioticInteractions
PhD Project on Genomics of Plant Toxin Resistance
Background: Plant secondary metabolites play a key
role in multitrophic interactions. We recently found
that natural enemies of herbivores can adapt to sec-
ondary metabolites that are taken up from the plant by
a specialist herbivore (https://www.pnas.org/content/-
116/46/23174). The capacity to deal with plant toxins
determines the predation success and biological control
potential of these organisms. Yet, the genetic and bio-
chemical mechanisms of this phenomenon are unclear,
which hampers our capacity to exploit it for sustainable
agriculture. The current PhD project aims at lling this
gap of knowledge by uncovering the genetic basis of ben-
zoxazinoid resistance in entomopathogenic nematodes.
The project is embedded in a collaboration between the
Biotic Interactions and Ecological Genomics Groups at
the Institute of Plant Sciences at the University of Bern.
We look for an enthusiastic and ambitious PhD student
with a strong interest in genomics and multitrophic in-
teractions. Applicants should have a rm background
in computational biology and an interest in combining
bioinformatics with laboratory work. All our projects
are highly integrative and require willingness to embrace
multiple biological sub disciplines. Fluency in English
is a prerequisite for this position. A MSc. degree or
Diploma with competitive grades is required.
We oer an inspiring and dynamic research environment,
including state-of-the art research facilities, extensive
supervision and an exciting project of considerable fun-
damental and applied relevance. Specic project tasks
can be tailored to the interests and training priorities of
the student. The Institute of Plant Sciences is located
at the shore of the river Aare, close to the vibrant city
center of Bern. PhD students are paid according to Uni-
versity standard rates and have the possibility to join
the graduate program in Molecular Life Sciences. More
information about our current activities can be found
here: https://www.ips.unibe.ch/research/interactions/How to apply: Send a single pdf including i) a letter of
motivation, ii) a detailed CV, iii) copies of University
grades and iv) the names and addresses of two referees
to matthias.erb@ips.unibe.ch. The position is available
from August 2020 and open until lled. For more infor-
mation, feel free to contact Matthias Erb directly.

MaternalEects
PhD studentship: Maternal eects and host-microbiome-
pathogen interactions in disease vectors Supervisors: Dr
Sinead English (University of Bristol), Dr Fleur Ponton
(Macquarie University)
The aim of this PhD project is to develop a formal
framework to understand host-microbiome- pathogen
interactions using important insect vectors of disease
(mosquitoes, tsetse) as exemplars. Most organisms
harbour a community of microbes that interact with
pathogens, either by direct resource competition or in-
directly through by aecting the host immune system.
In insect vectors of disease, there is increasing interest
in manipulating these microbes to decrease the vector
population size or interfere with pathogen transmis-
sion. Formal mathematical models are important tools
to show how perturbing one aspect of host-microbe-
pathogen system (e.g. removing microbes) changes the
overall dynamics.
The condition of the mother 'V her age, nutrition 'V
can also shape the microbial community and immunity
of her ospring. How these transgenerational eects
change the predictions of host- microbe-pathogen inter-
actions is yet to be explored. The student will build
on recent modelling work (King & Bonsall 2017, BMC
Evol Biol) to incorporate maternal eects into the host-
microbiome-pathogen system, and how this diers across
insect disease vectors. Maternal eects may be partic-
ularly important in vectors such as tsetse ies which
produce one enormous larva at a time compared to
mosquitoes which produce batches of many small eggs.
The PhD position will be jointly hosted at the Univer-
sity of Bristol, Bristol, UK and Macquarie University,July 1, 2020 EvolDir 23
Sydney, Australia. The PhD position is fully funded
for 3.5 years and will cover research costs, tuition fees,
stipend and ights between UK and Australia. The stu-
dent will be supervised by Dr Sinead English (Bristol)
[evelab.org] and Dr Fleur Ponton (Macquarie) [ponton-
lab.wordpress.com], as well as beneting from guidance
from Professor Mike Bonsall (Oxford) and Dr Antoine
Barreaux (Bristol). The student will spend 2 years in
Bristol and 1.5 years in Sydney during the project, devel-
oping models (Bristol/Oxford) and testing predictions
from these models in empirical systems such as tsetse
ies and mosquitoes (Bristol/Macquarie).
The project would suit a student with strong quantita-
tive skills, particularly in mathematical biology, and a
background in, or demonstrable enthusiasm for, evolu-
tionary ecology and entomology. The student will have
to be willing to live in two dierent countries (2 years in
Bristol, UK, and 1.5 years in Sydney, Australia). Con-
ditions of funding mean that the position is available
only to UK/EU students and an MSc qualication is
desirable. The studentship can start 1 January 2021 or
1 April 2021.
To apply, please email Dr Sinead English (see below)
with a 1-page cover letter describing your suitability
and eligibility for the position, a CV (max 2 pages)
and contact details for two academic (or other relevant)
referees by 15 July 2020. Video-conference interviews
will take place in the week commencing 20 July.

ChemosensoryGenomics
Title: Deciphering the evolution and ne-tuning of verte-
brate chemosensory systems using comparative genomics
About the project
Animal adaptation to dierent environments involves the
accumulation of changes in physiology, feeding ecology,
social structures, environmental habitats and circadian
rhythm. As such, the ability to infer and process envi-
ronmental chemosensory information is a crucial step
in adopting a novel niche, placing sensory perception at
the forefront of evolutionary adaptation.
Sensory perception is governed by a variety of dierent'sense-specic' membrane-bound 7-transmembrane G-
protein coupled receptor gene families encoded through-
out the genome, e.g. olfactory receptors, trace amine-
associated receptors, vomeronasal receptors and taste
receptors. Each gene family contains varying numbers
of coding sequences expressed in numerous cell types on
dierent sense organs. The ne-tuning of these dierent
sensory modes reect life-history traits (e.g. social-
ity), niche-specic evolutionary adaptations (e.g. diet)
and available sensory-space. However the relationships
between these remain poorly understood. Given the
current trend of cheaper sequencing costs, there are
now more vertebrate genomes available than ever be-
fore, allowing an unprecedented, in-depth exploration
of sensory evolution at the genomics level in a taxo-
nomically diverse sample set. This project will combine
comparative genomics, bioinformatics and phylogenetics
to explore chemosensory evolution, answering questions
such as 'what is the background rate of evolution in
chemosensory genes?', 'Do convergent life-history traits
reect sensory sequence convergence?', 'Does positive
selection at key residues reect lineage-specic spectral
tuning?', 'When is loss of sensory function adaptive?'
Core objectives in this project that you will research
include:
Objective 1: Establishing rates of evolution, loss of
function and duplication across sensory genes and back-
ground rates of gene evolution
Objective 2: Develop novel methods to explore positive
selection in multigene families.
Objective 3: Correlate loss, gain and lineage-specic
sensory evolution with life-history traits and ecological
niche adaptation to explore available sensory-spaces, e.g.
diet, sociality and pheromones and odorants.
Objective 4: Reconstruct ancestral sensory gene reper-
toires across the species tree, comparing extant and
ancestral gene evolution over vast time-frames.
This project is an Ad Astra-funded studentship, and will
be largely completed in silico, using the latest computa-
tional methods. Informal enquiries are welcome. The
studentships are open to EU and non-EU candidates
and are for a maximum of four years, renewable each
year, subject to satisfactory progress. UCD supports
equal opportunities and does not discriminate against
individuals on the basis of gender, age, race, colour,
nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion, marital
status, family status, sexual orientation, disability or
membership of the traveller community.

UGuelph PopGenMetagenom
Several graduate student positions are open at both the
MSc and PhD levels in my research group. Below is a
summary of projects with funding.
[1] Metagenomic analysis and theory
This project will apply and extend theory that stud-ies metagenomic data using population genetic prin-
ciples. The starting point is recent theory from
my group that focuses on amplicon-based approaches
and uses the coalescent to detect whether subsets
of individuals within a species or taxonomic group
go unamplied using genetic sequence data at hand.
The project can then be extended to shotgun-based
methods. A link to a foundational paper related to
the project is https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/-
10.1177/1176934319883612 [2] Modelling polyploid pop-
ulation genetics and evolution
This project would apply and extend recent multilocus
population genetic models of polyploids to understand
the evolution of recombination rates and the diploidiza-
tion process in polyploids. It follows from interest-
ing research that indicates recombination rates readily
evolve in polyploids and that the diploidization pro-
cess is not equal across genomes. Papers related to
the multilocus theory are https://academic.oup.com/-
jhered/article-abstract/110/7/866/5674929 and https:/-
/www.nature.com/articles/hdy201744 [3] Ancestral
graph theory of ecological communities
My group has started modelling ecological commu-
nities using ancestral graph approaches. I am look-
ing for a student interested in extending this ap-
proach to modelling the evolution of core and exible
genomes in bacterial communities. In addition, the
approach can be applied to inferring processes shap-
ing eukaryotic communities. A paper related to this
work is https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/-
abs/pii/S0022519318306325 A student can join my lab
either through the Department of Integrative Biology
or Bioinformatics graduate programs at the University
of Guelph, Canada. If you are interested in applying,

Fellow Tutku Aykanat's research group. The position is
a part of a 5-year Academy of Finland funded project,
and aims to understand the processes shaping Atlantic
salmon demography in the wild.
Atlantic salmon is a great organism to study gene-
phenotype-tness relationship in the wild. The presence
of substantial material from past research and monitor-
ing eorts, and a simple 2-locus system broadly controls
important life history variation (see refs below) allow
for an integrated framework to track adaptive genetic
variation in Atlantic salmon in the wild.
Using multigenerational, multi population datasets com-
posed of genetic and phenotypic information, the PhD
student will employ age structured population models
and whole food web approaches to understand the evo-
lutionary processes and ecological constrains shaping
Atlantic salmon life history variation and demography.
Professor Anna Kuparinen from the University of
Jyv askyl a will co-supervise the PhD student. The stu-
dent is expected to visit Kuparinen's group at the Uni-
versity of Jyv askyl a up to 12 months to master dynamic
food web modelling and apply it on Atlantic salmon.
The ideal candidate should demonstrate strong mathe-
matical / statistical understanding, experience in a sta-
tistical computing software such as R, JAGS, or matlab,
and interests in ecology and evolution, and familiarity
with quantitative genetics.
The appointee should either already have the right
to pursue a doctoral degree at the University of
Helsinki by the start of the appointment, or apply
for the right and obtain it within the probationary
period of six months of their appointment. If the

UKiel SelshChromosomes
*PhD position on **the evolutionary maintenance of
selsh accessory chromosomes***
A PhD position is available for three years to study the
*mechanism of the evolutionary maintenance of acces-
sory chromosomes in a fungal plant pathogen *with the
Max Planck research group \Environmental Genomics"
headed by Prof. Dr. Eva H. Stukenbrock and super-
vised by Dr. Michael Habig. The Max Planck group
is aliated with the *Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology* in Pl on and the *Christian-Albrechts
University of Kiel* in the North of Germany. The po-
sition will also be associated with the Kiel Evolution
Center, the Kiel Plant Center and the International
Max Planck Research School for Evolutionary Biology -
providing a unique scientic environment. The position
is compensated at 65% of TV-L 13 and candidates are
expected to complete a PhD.
*Background***
Selsh genetic elements are widespread in all groups of
organisms. These elements are likely to have shaped the
evolution of diverse biological systems, including genome
structure, sex determination, and meiosis. To date, sur-
prisingly little is known about the exact processes that
underlie the spread of these elements. This project aims
at understanding the transmission mechanism and its
evolutionary consequences of selsh accessory chromo-
somes in a fungal pathogen with a particular focus on
the role of histone modications.
Recently, we could show that the accessory chromosome
of the commercially important wheat pathogen /Zy-
moseptoria tritici/ show a chromosome drive, i.e. are
inherited to more progeny than expected by Mendelian
segregation. In addition these chromosomes show a neg-
ative tness eect and could therefore be considered
selsh elements. The mechanism of this chromosome
drive is however unknown - but recent data suggest that
histone modications might be involved.This project
aims at understanding this previously unknown aspect
of histone modications and its exploitation by selsh
chromosomes using the model organism /Z. tritici/.It
will involve the establishment of in vitro crosses and
the identication of the genetic and epigentic traitsresponsible for the chromosome drive.
*Expectations and Requirements:*
We seek a highly motivated candidate who wants to
actively drive a research project. The candidate must
have university degree (Master or equivalent) in biology
or a related eld. High competence in experimental
design, and English writing is a must. Ideally, the candi-
date has comprehensive experience in molecular genetics,
work with plant pathogens or performance of evolution
experiments. The selected candidate will have the op-
portunity to collaborate in an interdisciplinary team of
biologists (molecular biologists, evolutionary biologists
and population geneticists) as well as to pursue unique
research in the eld of chromosome biology.
Kiel University aims at a higher proportion of women
in research and education, and, therefore, specically
encourages qualied female scientists to apply. Female
scientists will be preferentially considered in case of
equivalent qualication, competence and achievements.
Kiel University specically supports employment of
severely handicapped people. Therefore, severely hand-
icapped applicants will be preferentially considered in
case of suitable qualication.
Kiel University specically welcomes application from
people with migration background.
*Application*
Applications should include a motivation letter (max.
2 pages long), CV, publication list, names and contact
details of two referees (who are familiar with the ap-
plicant's work), and copies of certicates. Deadline for
applications is 15. July 2020. Applications should be
sent to:

Research topic investigated during the PhD:
Contemporary climate change is currently altering biodi-
versity, and these impacts will intensify as temperatures
continue to increase in the future, with projected mas-
sive mortality aecting keystone species - such as forest
trees and corals. While increasing mismatch between
local climate and local genetic variation may be resolved
in time by a combination of natural selection and natural
migration, there is concern about the slow spontaneous
pace of these processes relative to the high speed of
climate change. Assisted gene ow (AGF) describes the
managed translocation of individuals within the current
range of a species, to facilitate rapid adaptation to cli-
mate change. Only a few recent models have started to
investigate how dierent AGF strategies may accelerate
adaptation; even fewer have attempted to quantify itsimpact on persistence and functioning of populations.
In particular, many species (trees, corals, alpine plants)
that are targeted for assisted gene ow are long-lived
and/or have complex life cycles with dierent stages hav-
ing dierent ecology and sensitivity to climate change,
which complicates the predictions about optimal AGF.
This requires the development of models describing both
the evolution and population dynamics of species for
which assisted gene ow is considered as a benecial
management strategy. Our goal is to develop such mod-
els to guide assisted gene ow strategies and inform
debates about the relevance of their use and their opti-
mal implementation. The PhD student will contribute
to this goal by developing new integro-projection models
(IPM) to describe the demography of organisms with
continuous growth, incorporating genetic variation in
growth and other life history traits. The integration of
evolution in IPMs is currently a subject of debates and
developments, but also a much needed tool to predict
eco-evolutionary dynamics in very long lived organisms,
such as trees, for which discrete stages are relatively
arbitrary. This model will be tted to data from surveys
of natural populations and common garden experiments
(using extensive data sets on trees and perennial plants
adaptation to climate). The model will be used to an-
swer questions about the best source of seeds when
replanting a population of long-lived organisms in a
changing climate, optimal mixed sources strategies to
deal with uncertainties of climate change, optimal num-
ber of migrants, the frequency of migration events and
nature of the migrants (e.g. hybrids from crosses). In
each of these scenarios, the emphasis will be in exam-
ining how the life cycle of organisms (lifespan, change
in selection intensity or direction along life, intensity of
natural gene ow) aects the performance of dierent
AGF strategies.

at the University of M unster, Germany, invites applica-
tions for a PhD Position in Biology (salary level TV-L
E13, 65%)
The position is xed term for 36 months, to be lled
at the earliest possible date. Currently, the regular
working time for full (100%) employment is 39 hours30 EvolDir July 1, 2020
and 50 minutes per week. The DFG-funded Research
Training Group \Evolutionary Processes in Adaptation
and Disease" (EvoPAD, GRK 2220) unites biological,
medical, and philosophical research at the University of
M unster. The core idea is to use the theory of evolution
to understand processes leading to adaptation and/or
disease. The PhD students within the RTG make use
of evolutionary thinking to address basic and medical
questions.
The successful candidate will work on transposon dy-
namics in response to environmental changes supervised
by Dr Francesco Catania and Prof J urgen Gadau at the
Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity. Transposable
Elements (TEs) populate the genome of essentially all
living beings. As the mobilization of TEs is potentially
deleterious, cells have evolved molecular machineries
that keep it in check. However, environmental stress
can disturb these machineries, activating the propaga-
tion of TEs and/or impacting the excision of TE-derived
sequences. What are the consequences of these stress-
induced TE dynamics? This question is the focus of this
project, which pays particular attention to the possi-
bility that stress-induced TE dynamics are not entirely
random. It leverages a computational approach - com-
parative genomics/transcriptomics - and uses the single-
celled ciliate Paramecium and multicellular eukaryotes
as model systems.

Genetic variation in within-individual variance: is it
important in the wild?
Most model of evolution consider that intra-individual
variance, once corrected for environmental variation, is
essentially random noise and is similar across individ-
uals. However, recent studies in captivity showed that
within-individual variance could in fact have a genetic
basis. In addition, several studies on captive animal
have shown the evolutionary importance of the genetic
variance in individual variation. For examples, animal
breeding try to select for milking cows with low daily
variation in milk production to facilitate stock predic-
tion and management. So if we start to understand
the importance and the interest of the genetic basis of32 EvolDir July 1, 2020
within-individual variation in breeding programs, the
evolutionary importance of this genetic component re-
main relatively unknown in the wild. Consequently, to
better understand evolution in the wild it is key to eval-
uate the existence and quantify the amount of genetic
variance in the intra- individual variance of traits and
how it correlates with other traits including tness. Ide-
ally to get a wider understanding of the phenomenon,
such study would need to look at multiple type of traits
and across multiple species. Since this has rarely been
done, to get a better understanding this needs to be
evaluated across multiple traits and species. The aim of
this project is to used new quantitative genetic models,
a statistical approach allowing to estimate the genetic
variance in a trait in wild population, to quantify the ge-
netic variation in within-individual variance in multiple
traits across at least 5 species using long-term pedigreed
natural populations including yellow-bellied marmots,
alpine swifts, eastern chipmunks, bighorn sheep and red
squirrels. The project will thus be based on over 150
years of eld work (combined across all species). This
project will oer opportunity to learn a variety of impor-
tant methods in evolutionary biology and to participate
in the eld work on the marmot system. The student
will be given a thorough training in eld skills and in
statistical modelling to tease apart the amount of trait
variance explained by genetic and environmental eects.

Dear EvolDir members,
There is an opening for a PhD position at the Faculty of
Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Tech-
nologies <https://www.famnit.upr.si/en >, University
of Primorska (Koper, Slovenia).
The PhD candidate's work will focus, using an interdis-ciplinary approach, on the understanding of ecosystem
functioning, species evolutionary processes and how con-
servation actions should integrate this knowledge for
long term planning. Specically, in the course of his/her
training, young researcher will investigate the evolution-
ary implications of hybridization, from the introgression
of important phenotypic traits between species, to the
creation of new species through hybrid speciation and
adaptation to dierent environmental conditions. The
young researcher will develop the bioinformatic tools
to analyse, identify and categorise hybrids, their level
of introgression, and the frequency of introgression in
dierent populations/ecosystems. The work will also
address the time of the hybridization event 'V recent vs.
ancient 'V to understand the behaviour of introgressed
loci in their new genomic background, their inuence
on survival, adaptation and expansion potential of the
species. Young researcher will perform (meta-)analysis
of the genetic introgression eects and genotypic diver-
sity across individuals, populations and ecosystem levels
of wild plant/animal and their domestic relatives or
between lines of interest in order to: i) detect signa-
tures of selection on introgressed genes, ii) investigate
links between introgression and phenotypic variation
and tness.
This is a 4-year fully funded position (ocially called

EvolutionHornwortPyrenoids
PhD position in plant evolutionary biology, University
of Zurich. University of Zurich, Dept. of systematic and
Evolutionary Botany
RESEARCH PROJECT: Genetic basis of hornwort
carbon-concentrating mechanisms.
Biophysical carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs)
operating at the single-cell level have evolved indepen-
dently in some eukaryotic algae and a single lineage of
land plants, the hornworts. An essential component
for an ecient biophysical CCM is a pyrenoid, which
represents a specialized compartment inside chloroplasts
that mainly comprise the CO2-xing enzyme RuBisCO.
Hornworts with pyrenoids x signicantly more car-
bon than their relatives without pyrenoids. Given the
repeated gains and losses of pyrenoids in hornworts
during the last 50 million years, we may assume that
their assembly is potentially controlled by a few masterregulators of eco-evolutionary relevance. In a joint ef-
fort, we will combine comparative -omics with reverse
genetics tools to study the genetics, function, and molec-
ular basis of pyrenoid-based CCM in hornwort plastids
under dierent environmental conditions. Guided by
ultrastructure-based monitoring of the pyrenoid assem-
bly in hornworts, we aim to identify the genetic toolkit
of biophysical CCM in hornworts through two interde-
pendent approaches: First, we aim to predict candidate
CCM components in silico though a set of homology
searches that compare the hornwort gene set with algal
CCM component. Second, we employ an exploratory
gene and protein (co)expression proling of isolated plas-
tids collected under low vs. high CO2 concentrations
and under ooding. A strength of our experimental
design is that we contrast up to three pairs of pyrenoid
bearing and pyrenoid lacking hornwort species. Finally,
we will investigate pyrenoid functionality under vari-
ous environmental conditions. Specically, we aim to
conduct localization and functional validation analyses
for a core set of genes discovered in our CCM gene
prediction approaches. These experiments are possible
through our recent advances to establish Anthoceros
agrestis and other hornwort species as a tractable model
system. Together, our collaborative project will not
only allow a comparison of the mechanisms of pyrenoid
assembly between algae and hornworts, but also reveal
general principles and species-specic innovations in the
evolution of carbon-concentrating plastids. Above that,
focusing on and understanding the basis of land plant
CCM instead of only the algal form could eventually
contribute to eciently engineer pyrenoid assembly and
boost photosynthetic eciency of crops. Relevant pub-
lications: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-

PhD Position in Plant-Pathogen Herbarium Genomics
University of Zurich, Switzerland
We are looking for a PhD student to explore phylo-
geographic patterns and (co-)evolutionary dynamics in
plant pathosystems by means of herbarium genomics
and population genetic analyses. This 4-year position
starts in January 2021 and is funded by the University
Research Priority Program (URPP) \Evolution in Ac-
tion: From Genomes to Ecosystems" of the University
of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland.
RESEARCH PROJECT
Plant pathogens have had a strong impact on human so-
cieties since historical times. Together with their hosts,
plant pathogens also oer a great opportunity to study
coevolution. In this project, you will generate and anal-
yse next generation sequencing data for an economicallyimportant plant pathosystem with host and pathogen
reference genomes available. Combining modern DNA
with historical DNA isolated from herbarium specimens,
you will compare patterns of past and present genetic
diversity and infer evolutionary processes from these
patterns. This project provides the unique opportu-
nity of jointly analysing host and pathogen genomes to
identify signatures of concerted evolution at individual
genes and across the genome. The project also oers
room for theory development. During your PhD, you
will contribute to teaching at the Bachelor and Master
level.
WHAT WE OFFER
- Cutting-edge clean-room laboratory specialised on his-
torical/ancient DNA (aDNA) - In-house sequencing fa-

55653422 Complex systems science has been able
to successfully describe and characterize a swathe of
phenomena in biology, from the wiring of neurons in
the brain to the structure of gene regulatory networks40 EvolDir July 1, 2020
encoding phenotypic traits, or from the emergence of
self-organized collective behaviour in animal societies
to explaining complex ecosystem dynamics.
Recent work, however, has shown that these complex bi-
ological systems can only fully be understood by treating
them as complex adaptive systems and as the outcomes
of an evolutionary process that has shaped them through
selection in complex environments.
This paradigm shift led to the development of a num-
ber of subelds in the study of complex systems, such
as evolutionary systems biology, which aims to explain
evolved features of gene regulatory networks, including
their modularity and robustness, and which also consid-
ers the origin of complex genotype-phenotype mappings,
eco-evolutionary dynamics, which injects evolution into
ecological system dynamics and models the complex
feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes
and adaptive dynamics and evolutionary game theory,
which model evolutionary dynamics in explicit ecological
and social settings. In all these elds, it has been found
that explicitly considering the evolutionary process can
greatly help our understanding of the functioning of bi-
ological systems. Applications are numerous and range
from explaining how evolution shapes the way in which
microbial populations develop tolerance or resistance to
antibiotics to explaining how populations or ecosystems
adapt to changing or uctuating environments, for ex-
ample, in bioreactors or under the inuence of global
environmental change.
We are hereby advertising a full-time academic vacancy
in the area of the theoretical modelling of complex bio-
logical systems at the KU Leuven. We are looking for
internationally oriented candidates with strong exper-
tise in the modelling of both ecological and evolutionary
dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales and
with educational competence within the eld of com-
putational ecology and evolution and/or evolutionary
systems biology.
Suitable candidates could come from diverse elds, in-
cluding computational ecology and evolution, complex
systems science or evolutionary systems biology. We ex-
pect the candidate to develop a research program aimed
at distilling common properties of complex adaptive
biological systems and approach this from a highly inter-
disciplinary angle, involving the collaboration between
evolutionary (micro)biologists, ecologists, theoretical bi-
ologists and systems biologists. Examples of questions
that could be addressed are how and how fast biological
systems adapt in response to changes in their environ-
ment or how robustness to environmental perturbations
is created at the level of the cell, individual, population,
community or ecosystem.Ellen Decaestecker <ellen.decaestecker@kuleuven.be >

modeling, statistical and machine learning, algorithmics
and computer science.
In this context, a Full Professor position is susceptible
to open early 2021 in the Laboratoire de Biom etrie et de
Biologie ~Avolutive (LBBE, Universit e de Lyon, France),
for a teaching and a research activity in the elds of
mathematics, statistics and/or algorithmics, such as ap-
plied to bioinformatics and genomics. A minimum of 5
years of service as a lecturer, and with the corresponding
experience in teaching and supervising of MSc and PhD
students, is typically expected. Owing to the specic
challenges raised by the inherently multi-disciplinary
nature of bioinformatics, a special emphasis in the re-
cruitment will be put on the ability of the candidate to
develop and promote an ambitious strategic and peda-
gogical perspective concerning the place of mathematics,
statistics, computer and data sciences in the teaching
programs and the current research in bioinformatics.
Teaching. Teaching will be primarily targeted to the
bioinformatics master, with additional teaching eort
also devoted to the local undergraduate and graduate
programs of biosciences, ecology and health. In this
context, the person recruited will have much freedom in
the design of innovative courses in mathematics, statis-
tics, stochastic modeling and/or algorithmics applied
to bioinformatics and genomics. She/he will also have
the opportunity to participate in the development of
new multi-disciplinary programs, in partnership withthe math and computer sciences departments of the
university. Of note, some of the courses (in particular
undergraduate programs) will have to be given in french
(within two years after recruitment).
Research. The person recruited will be aliated to the
LBBE, where she/he will have the opportunity to de-
velop a research project with a strong theoretical and
methodological component, in relation with stochastic
modeling and data analysis in bioinformatics, evolu-
tionary, molecular or cellular biology. Her/his research
activity may pertain to a broad range of themes, includ-
ing: methods, algorithms and stochastic models applied
to multi-omics; machine learning, AI and deep learning
applied to the analysis of molecular and functional data;
models and methods in population genetics, evolution-
ary or statistical genomics. Finally, the methodological
research developed by the person recruited in the context
of the present call may also happen to meet some of the
current needs in ecology, evolution and health sciences,
and as such, oer an opportunity for a broad range of
possible collaborations within the host laboratory.

It is National Insect Week in the UK. We would like to
hear suggestions for high priority arthropod reference
genomes that you would like to see sequenced as part
of the Darwin Tree of Life project. The focus of the
Darwin Tree of Life Project is to build high quality
reference genomes for all 60k described species found in
the UK, and we are currently working on the rst 2000
species. You can read a bit more about the project at

Because over 1/3 of described UK species are arthropods,
we would be grateful to hear from the wider scientic
community as to which UK arthropod species would
be most useful earliest in the project. Even if you are
working on something that doesn't live in the UK, please

Genes
Submit a paper in a special issue \Genome Diversity of
Adaptation and Speciation"
Dear Colleagues,
A special issue is now open for submission in Genes
(ISSN 2073-4425). This special issue belongs to the
section \Population and Evolutionary Genetics and
Genomics". https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes/-
special issues/Genome Adaptation Speciation Uncover-
ing the underlying mechanisms of adaptation and specia-
tion is perhaps the most signicant quest of evolutionary
science ever since the introduction of the concept in the
\Origin of Species." Darwin recognized that for evolution
to take place, individuals in populations had to be dier-
ent from each other, and that these dierences become
the substrate of the divergence into dierent species.
However, the science of his time was extremely limited
in the type of diversity that could be documented. As
we entered the genomics era, the situation has changed
drastically: every time genome data is released for a
new species, or a new sequencing technology or analytic
tool is introduced, the scope of opportunities expands
for exploring inter- and intra-specic variation. These
new opportunities allow us to document and study the
process of adaptation and speciation in a whole new
way.
The process of speciation is a key aspect of understand-
ing biodiversity. Explaining how species evolve is an
essential step to reconstructing past and current bio-
diversity and predict its future. The availability of
the genome data provides a unique window into spe-
ciation mechanisms with virtually innite amounts of
information. At the same time, recent computational
developments are supplying an unprecedented power
to simulations, analytic and reconstruction algorithms.
Given these new opportunities, past evolutionary events
that left important clues about the history of species can
now be documented, interpreted, and explained. At the
same time, these developments are raising new and chal-
lenging questions that require improved understanding
of the underlying molecular mechanisms, evolutionary
concepts, and factors to be addressed.
Whether at the level of the Tree of Life or within specicclades, the quest that evolutionary biologists now face
is how to interpret the information embedded within
genomes to explain biodiversity. This quest can be tack-
led with many dierent approaches that are rooted in
the optimization and development of computational and
analytical tools to interpret data. With a new arsenal
of genomic data, bioinformatic and analytical tools, we
are given an opportunity to answer pressing questions
(i) on the predictions of evolutionary theory in the face
of the environmental change, (ii) how mechanisms of
adaptation and long-term survival are linked to the con-
cepts of species diversity, genetic load, and extinction,
and (iii) how evolutionary models can be rened to
better represent the complexities of genome changes.
All these questions have strong implications for conser-
vation biology, ecosystem balance, and the genomics
changes associated with the birth and death of species.
We invite you to contribute to this Special Issue, which
will showcase original contributions to the advancement
in the genomic diversity of adaptation and speciation.
Please consider submitting to our issue.
I will be happy to answer any question regarding the
issue

PCR covid tests
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
sorry to bug you again about this, but the covid-PCRing
situation in most developing countries is truly desperate.
Some countries had to stop testing all together.
They have a dire need to bypass the use of kits by using
stock chemicals and enzymes.
They also need to mass-test people who work with risk
groups (expected cov19+ frequency=0.0), using sample
pooling to stop wasting resources with individual tests.
The pooling limits being touted so far range from 5x
to~30x. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/-
2020.03.26.20039438v1 ror https://www.thelancet.com/-
journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30362-
5/fulltext
So please be kind, dear ancient- and forensic-DNA (and
any others) wet-bench experts in evoldir, get together
to generate a list of your best tricks for PCRing samples
with very little target sequence. And don't forget your
stock solutions!
It should be shared with the WHO directly rather than
circulated here.
It is not important if your tricks are for trace DNA, since
the pooled RT step can be optimized separately (tricks
for trace-RNA RT from forensists and neontologists?)..
Also tricks for samples with lots of garbage non-target56 EvolDir July 1, 2020
RNA and DNA are important.
And any tricks for eld ash-prepping a sputum sam-
ple w/o need for subsequent cold storage? (directly
dumping spit into a tube with phenol mix maybe). Like
here:

about optimizing things for LAMP-detection in pooled
samples with very little sample DNA.

Hi,
I'm announcing the release of software called BES
(Bayesian Estimator of Selng) to estimate selng rates
from unlinked genetic data:
||| https://github.com/bredelings/-
BayesianEstimatorSelng New in version 0.1.3:
* allow using FastPhase and Phase 2 les for genetic
data
* estimate the selng rate more robustly when there are
additional sources of inbreeding.
BES yields posterior estimates for the selng rate, mu-
tation rates, and the number of generations of selng
for each individual, as described in the following paper:

Research Project The postdoctoral researcher will work
on a project that aims at understanding the genetic basis
of urban adaptation in Anopheles mosquitoes (BFU2017-
82937-P, MINECO/AEI/FEDER, EU). Identifying the
genomic basis of environmental adaptation is a growing
eld of research. Advances in whole genome sequencing
and other high-throughput technologies allow us to iden-
tify and characterize the genes and traits more relevant
for environmental adaptation. Most of our knowledge so
far comes from the analysis of one type of genetic vari-
ant: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Other
types of variants such as transposable element inser-
tions, that are complex mutations likely to play a role in
adaptation, are largely ignored. Our laboratory is at the
forefront of the research aimed at elucidating the contri-
bution of transposable to adaptation. We are experts in
population genomics, transposable element dynamics,
and in the detection of signatures of natural selection.
In this project, we will apply our proven expertise in
these research elds to elucidate the role of transposable
elements in adaptation in Anopheles. Adaptation to
urban environments in Anopheles mosquitoes is highly
relevant because it has direct consequences for the abil-
ity of these mosquitoes to transmit malaria. We are
using the latest technological advances in long-read se-
quencing techniques to generate new reference genomes
that allow us to de novo annotate transposable elements
in these genomes. We will then use state-of-the-art
methodologies to look for signatures of selection both
in SNPs and in transposable element insertions to get acomprehensive picture of urban adaptation in Anophe-
les.
Duties The postdoctoral researcher will be responsible
for the analysis of patterns of demography and selec-
tion in natural populations of Anopheles mosquitoes in
the context of urban adaptation. Among others, the
tasks involved in the postdoctoral research project will
be identifying signatures of selective sweeps, identifying
evidence of population dierentiation, and looking for as-
sociations between genetic and environmental variables
in the genome sequences of several natural Anopheles
populations.
Candidate requisites A PhD in Evolutionary Biology or
a related eld, good organizational skills, and good writ-
ing skills are required. Previous professional experience
will be considered.
What do we oer?
We oer a full-time position. Salary will depend on
the experience of the candidate. The candidate will
join a research team of three postdoctoral researchers
and three PhD students. The lab also oers extensive
networking opportunities as we are co? \leading the Eu-
ropean Drosophila population Genomics Consortium
(droseu.net) that brings together 61 research labs across
27 countries, and the Spanish excellence network in

Research Project The postdoctoral researcher will work
on a project funded by the European Research Council
that aims at identifying the genetic basis, the molecular
mechanisms, and the functional traits relevant for envi-
ronmental adaptation (H2020-ERC-2014-CoG-647900).
Understanding how organisms adapt to their environ-
ments is a long-standing problem in Biology with far-
reaching implications: adaptation aects the ability
of species to survive in changing environments, host-
pathogen interactions, and resistance to pesticides and
drugs. Despite recent progress, adaptation is to date a
poorly understood process largely due to limitations of
current approaches that focus (i)on a priori candidate
genes; (ii) on signals of selection at the DNA levelwith-
out functional validation of the identied candidates;
and (iii) on small sets of adaptive mutations that do not
represent the variability present in natural populations.
As a result, major questions such as what is the relative
importance of dierenttypes of mutations in adapta-
tion?, and what is the importance of epigenetic changes
in adaptive evolution?, remain largely unanswered. To
gain a deep understanding of adaptation, we need to
systematically identify adaptive mutations across space
and time, pinpoint their molecularmechanisms and

The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cor-
nell University is looking for two highly motivated post-
docs. The rst postdoc will work on an NSF-funded
project aimed at elucidating the genomic underpinnings
of adaptive divergence despite extensive gene ow in
the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia). The Atlantic
silverside is a small estuarine sh that exhibits a remark-
able degree of local adaptation in growth rates and a
suite of other traits tightly associated with a climatic
gradient across latitudes. Decades of prior lab and eld
studies have made the Atlantic silverside one of the ma-
rine species for which we have the best understanding
of evolutionary tradeos among traits and drivers of
selection causing adaptive divergence. Recently, our lab
began examining the underlying genomic basis, and we
have found striking patterns of dierentiation involving
multiple large inversions. Varying levels of gene ow
across the species range create a natural experiment
for testing general predictions about the genomic mech-
anisms that enable adaptive divergence in the face of
gene ow, and key goals of the project include integrat-
ing patterns of variation in the wild with ndings from
trait mapping to 1) examine how genomic architectures
underlying local adaptation vary across connectivity
regimes and 2) elucidating the potential role of chromo-
somal rearrangements and other tight linkage among
adaptive alleles in facilitating adaptation. The postdoc
will have access to low-coverage whole genome sequenc-
ing for >1,000 individuals, a chromosome-level genome
assembly, QTL maps, RNA-seq data, and will have
exibility to pursue dierent directions based on their
interests.
The second postdoc will work on a NYDEC-funded
project aimed at uncovering genome-wide patterns of
variation in American shad across its distribution range
and developing cost-eective genomic screening tools to
aid conservation eorts and sheries management. The
American shad (Alosa sapidissima) is an anadromous
sh native to the east coast of North America. It has for
centuries been one of the region's most important sh-
eries species - so much that it in the US has been called
\the sh that fed the nation's founders". More recently,
however, the species has faced population extirpations
across its range and despite extensive restoration eorts,
abundances are at historic lows in many areas. Con-
servation planning eorts would substantially benet62 EvolDir July 1, 2020
from a better understanding of the population structure
and degree of local adaptation in American shad and an
ability to assign ocean-going adults back to their river
of origin.
Earlier microsatellite work detected only weak genetic
dierentiation across the species range, but shad are
distributed across very heterogeneous environments and
divergent selection may have driven highly elevated
levels of dierentiation in localized genomic regions as-
sociated with local adaptation, a pattern now seen in
many other sh species. The goal of this project is
to conduct genome-wide scans to identify genomic re-
gions that show maximal dierences in allele frequencies
across both small and large spatial scales, and based
on these develop powerful genetic assignment tools for
inferring where shad caught as bycatch in ocean sheries
originate from. The project will be carried out in close
collaboration with the New York Department of Envi-
ronmental Conservation and being based on linked-read
whole genome sequencing of >500 individuals (haplotag-
ging), it will provide an exciting opportunity to leverage
novel haplotype-resolved genomic techniques to address
practical management needs in a high-prole species
while at the same time exploring more basic questions
about the forces that drive genome-wide patterns of
variation in high gene ow systems. Exhibiting a re-
markable variation in reproductive strategy and other
phenotypic traits across its range, and recently having
successfully colonized the entire west coast of North
America after being introduced to California in the late
1800s, the American shad has tremendous, but yet unex-
plored, promise as a model to study how species adapt
to new conditions - an issue of urgent importance in our
rapidly changing world. The postdoc will be encour-
aged to pursue and integrate both the applied and more
fundamental lines of inquiry based on their interests.
Qualications: Candidates should have completed or
be within 1-3 months of completing a PhD in evolu-
tionary genomics, molecular ecology, bioinformatics or
a related eld. We are looking for creative and talented
scientists who are team players with good publication

have been documented in deep lakes and oceanic islands
all over the world, but are likely also widespread in
mountains. Physically rugged landscapes such as those
of the European Alps give rise to endemic species radia-
tions through the interaction of dispersal limitation with
steep ecological gradients and insular habitat structure.
Terrestrial and aquatic, plant and animal radiations in
the Alps have been studied in isolation. In this project
we want to analyse them in a common framework in
order to identify factors that explain variation between
taxa and ecosystems in the prevalence and distribution
of species radiations within a common region. For this
we have compiled large data sets for multiple large clades
representative of biodiversity in and around the Alps:
amphipods, sh, owering plants, butteries.
You will build phylogenetic trees based on sequence data,
map current and reconstruct ancestral species ranges
for classifying species as resulting from immigration, an-
agenesis or cladogenesis, and from geographical modes
of speciation. You will extract climate and habitat pref-
erences from occurrence data to determine if speciation
events were associated with niche conservatism or niche
divergence. You will map the relative importance of
these alternative processes back to the physical land-
scapes and to phylogenetic trees to assess to what extent
the same or dierent principles drive community assem-
bly in distinct ecosystems within a shared landscape and
climate history. You will synthesize the information into
manuscripts for leading disciplinary or interdisciplinary
journals.
The postdoctoral fellow will work with extensive exist-
ing datasets of the Seehausen and Zimmermann groups,
as well as datasets of collaborators Florian Altermatt,
Jakob Brodersen, Blake Matthews (all Eawag), Loic
Pellissier, Catherine Graham (both WSL), and Lukas
R uber (Natural History Museum Bern). The project

We are seeking a Research Associate or Fellow to work
on antimicrobial resistance and evolutionary epidemiol-
ogy of the major mould pathogen A. fumigatus. The
post will be based in the MRC Centre for Global In-
fectious Disease Analysis (GIDA) within the School of
Public Health at Imperial College London.
The position is funded by a Wellcome Trust funded 4-
year Collaborative Award, led by Prof Matthew Fisher,
and will investigate the escalating incidence of drug-
resistant Aspergillus fumigatus coinfections in patients
with pulmonary conditions such as cystic brosis, in-
uenza and COVID-19.
The understanding we will achieve by this research will
be critical for making informed decisions on current clin-
ical and agricultural practice, as well as highlighting the
most benecial novel antifungal agents amongst those
in current development (see Fisher et al. Worldwide
emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs challenges
human health and food security Science 2018).
The overarching aim of the project is to understand and
quantify the risk that presents to public health within
two countries, the UK and the Netherlands, where large
and well characterised at-risk patient populations are
showing an increasing incidence of aspergillosis that is re-
sistant to the widely-used class of azole antifungal drugs.
Our research will address the following research ques-
tions: 1. - What are the frequencies of environmentally-
acquired and in- host evolved azole-resistant infections
and what are the genetic backgrounds upon which they
occur? 2. - Does azole-resistance combine with specic
genetic backgrounds to heighten A. fumigatus tness
and virulence? 3. - Are there genetic barriers to the
spread of the emerging spectrum of azole-resistant muta-
tions? 4. - How does the emergence of azole-resistance
impact the ecacy of new incoming antifungal drugs?
The post is oered initially for 12 months but can beJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 65
extended for a total of 4-years. The successful applicant
will have a key role on experimental design within the
project, shaping the analytical framework, coordinat-

start the 1 st of October 2020. A one-year extension is
negotiable.
The post-doctoral fellow will work in the framework
of the ERC project \Hyperdiverse" (ERC-COG-2019,
# 865101), which seeks at identifying the drivers of
diversication in a group of marine predatory snails, the70 EvolDir July 1, 2020
neogastropods. One of the goals of the project is to
sequence 15 genomes of species characterized by various
feeding and developmental strategies,that might have
inuenced the evolutionary success of the group.

will use hybrid assembly strategy to generate rst high
quality genomes of the Neogastropoda, known to have
a large genome size (2-5Gb), with many repeated ele-
ments. The post-doc fellow will have to assemble the
genomes, combining data from various sequencing tech-
nologies (Illumina, Minion, PacBio). In the subsequent
annotation step, he will also be in charge of the genome
annotation, in particular to identify candidate genes
involved in feeding (e.g. toxins, anesthetics, etc) and
in larval development, integrating population genomics
approaches.
Within the \Institut de Syst ematique, Evolution et Bio-
diversit e" of the MNHN, the post-doc fellow will work in
the team 3E (\Exploration, Esp eces, Evolution"), work-

this scientically and societally urgent topic, the ETH
board (Switzerland) has allocated funding to research on
Blue-Green Biodiversity (BGB). One goal of this funding
initiative is to strengthen interdisciplinary biodiversity
research, particularly across ecosystem boundaries. As
a result, all funded projects represent collaborations
between two Swiss research institutes: WSL (Swiss Fed-
eral Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research:
www.wsl.ch/en) and Eawag (Swiss Federal Institute of
Aquatic Science and Technology: www.eawag.ch/en).

We seek an exceptional post-doctoral candidate to work
with Professor Barbara Mable and Dr. Harriet Auty, inthe Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Com-
parative Medicine (IBAHCM). The applicant will make
a leading contribution to bioinformatics and statistical
analysis of a project recently funded by the Leverhulme
Trust, entitled \What can you learn from a y? Biting
insects as noninvasive samplers". Specically, the job
requires expert knowledge in database mining, process-
ing and analysing omics datasets, and a specic focus
on methods development. The successful candidate will
also be expected to contribute to the formulation and
submission of research publications and research pro-
posals, as well as help manage and direct this complex
and challenging project, as opportunities allow.
Aims and Approach: The overall aims of this study are
to: (i) develop a new generation of genome-wide markers
that are suciently variable and sensitive to make pop-
ulation genetics inferences from forensic samples; and
(ii) using this approach, to test the potential of blood-
feeding ies as non-invasive samplers to learn more about
population biology of wildlife, which could ultimately
be used to inform management decisions that consider
levels and patterns of genetic variation in threatened
species. The technology now exists but the challenge is
the bioinformatics to identify genomic regions that are
informative about adaptive and demographic processes
and that could be applied across species. We envision
that the approach will have broad applicability across a
wide range of research questions. Here we will develop
and rigorously test the potential of this approach to
assess the population genetic structure of vertebrate
host populations of conservation value in East Africa.

UHelsinki TransGenerationalEects
POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER POSITION at Uni-
versity of Helsinki
in an integrative project to address the role of trans-
generational eects in stress tolerance for a xed
term of two and a half years. The starting date is
1.10.2020, but a later starting date can be negotiated.
The post doc will join the Life-history Evolution Re-
search group led by Associate Professor Marjo Saas-
tamoinen (https://www.helsinki./en/researchgroups/-
life-history-evolution). The overreaching aim of the
project is to understand the potential adaptive role of
trans-generational impacts and underlying epi(genetic)
mechanisms to environmental stress using the Glanville
fritillary buttery as a study organism. The project
builds on an on-going work indicating that both in-
dividual' ^As own developmental conditions and thoseexperienced by its mother shape its phenotype. Further-
more, epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses suggest
that within- and transgenerational responses are medi-
ated by distinct pathways.
We are seeking a post doc to continue this project
in order to understand the potential adaptive nature
and/or the impact of paternal condition in the trans-
generational stress responses. The post doc will par-
ticipate in planning and conducting the experiment(s),
analyse the phenotypic and genomic (transcriptomic
and ATAC-sequencing) data, and lead the writing of
the resulting manuscript(s). There is also potential for
analysing part of the existing data. The successful can-
didate is expected to have demonstrable experience in
bioinformatic analyses of genomic data as well as strong
background in evolutionary ecology and experimental
approaches. Thus, the postdoctoral researcher will work
at the interface of evolutionary ecology and genomics.
Applicants should have completed a PhD in evolution-
ary ecology or a related eld, and have bioinformat-
ics and statistical skills. We seek candidates with ex-
cellent written and verbal communication skills, and
the ability to conceive, execute and complete research
projects, and to think independently and creatively.
The post doc will work as a part of a team and thus
good social skills are required. For more information,
contact assoc. prof. Marjo Saastamoinen by email:
marjo.saastamoinen@helsinki.
The starting salary will be ca. 3300'V3800 euros/month,
depending on the appointee' ^As qualications and expe-
rience.

2 postdoctoral and 2 PhD positions: Evolutionary ge-
nomics/behaviour University of Lausanne, Department
of Ecology and Evolution
We are looking for PhD students and postdoctorals to
work on three lines of research: 1. Ant behaviour. The
idea is to study the evolution of division of labour with
a new system based on ducial identication labels and
video tracking. This system which automatically fol-
low all the individuals in a colony allows quantitative
studies of behaviour. 2. Ant genetics. We previously
identied a supergene inuencing social organization in
the re ant Solenopsis invicta. We have sequenced ve
closely-related species and found that the same genomic
element is also responsible for variation in social orga-
nization. The aim of the project is to analyse how this
large non-recombining region is evolving. 3. Evolution-
ary genomics. We are sequencing + generating RNAseq
data for queens and workers of ca. 80 ant species. These
data will be available for all sorts of analyses related
to social evolution and the study of the genetic basis
underlying dierences between castes.
These positions will be funded by an ERC grant and
the Swiss NSF. Other topics of research on social be-
haviour are also possible if they t the research interests
of our group : http://www.unil.ch/dee/keller-group
The Department of Ecology and Evolution is a well-
funded and vibrant research institution, with superb
facilities. Applications should comprise a CV, a list
of publications, 1 page describing why you are inter-
ested in joining our group and contact information for
three referees. Only applications with all these informa-

Applications are invited for the post of Postdoctoral
Research Assistant in the Department of Biological Sci-
ences at Royal Holloway University of London.
We are looking for a highly motivated individual to
join the research group of Dr. Francisco Ubeda as a
Postdoctoral Research Assistant. We are interested in
modelling evolution in general and intra-genomic con-
ict in particular. The successful candidate will work
on a NSF-NERC funded research project which focuses
on the evolution of recombination, paternal genome
elimination and sperm parasitism in species with sex-
ual reproduction. The project will involve formulating
mathematical and computational models and using the
predictions of these models to direct empirical work
on the evolution of meiosis in sperm parasitic species.
This project is an exciting opportunity to understand
the circumstances under which natural selection favours
dierent mechanisms of recombination and how intra-
genomic conict can transform genomic architectures.
You will be responsible for the formulation and analysis
of mathematical/computational models. You will also
be responsible for the preparation for publication and
presentation of the results from the models. You will
work alongside the project's Principal Investigator.
The successful candidate will have a PhD in Biology,
Mathematics or Mathematical Biology (it is acceptable
to be in the nal phase of a PhD programme). A good
publication record in peer-reviewed journals is essential,
and experience of presenting at international conferences
is highly desirable. You will have extensive experience
of mathematical modelling in the eld of evolution, and
be familiar with population genetics and evolutionary
theory. We are searching for an experienced, indepen-
dent and forward-thinking researcher. Royal Holloway
University of London is host to a vibrant community of
researchers in Evolution.

Salary: 30,942 to 40,322 per annum (pro-rata if applica-
ble) depending on skills and experience. Closing Date:
Thursday 09 July 2020
Our projects employ large scale population genomics,
but at the same time have explicitly phenotype-rst
orientations. In each case we aim to determine the ge-
netic basis and evolutionary repeatability of adaptation
to intense, quantiable selection pressures, both envi-
ronmental and intracellular. We do this by applying
population genomics to wild plant populations that have
evolved to overcome demonstrable hazards.
We currently focus on adaptation to genome duplication
as well as adaptation to highly challenging, quanti-
able environmental stressors in species ranging from
Arabidopsis arenosa, to Mimulus guttatus and back
throughout the Brassicaceae to A. lyrata and A. thaliana
and Cochlearia. We also work on polyploidy in frogs
and sh. There is lots of awesome eld work in the
mountains and chances in interact with international
collaborators too.
See https://www.yantlab.net/ for more.
The role: Primary activities will include conducting
large-scale population genomic projects. This includes
exhaustive demographic and selection analyses of popu-
lation genomic data. We require candidates who are not
only motivated to run with these objectives, but who
can also propose new creative project contributions. By
the end of your postdoctoral term with us, we expect
you to be able to, for example, begin your own group,
bringing along your project from our work together. We
also expect to engender the development of new direc-
tions as a result of discoveries in our group that can
spur independent trajectories for your future research.
The ideal candidate: Applicants passionate about evolu-
tionary genetics or population genomics are encouraged
to apply. The successful candidate will possess a PhD
and a strong relevant publication history. They will
also have good knowledge of population genetics and
demonstrable use of computational methods in an evolu-
tionary context. The ideal candidate will have initiative,
analytical skills, and a drive to push forward on new
problems in evolutionary genomics as part of a highlycollaborative team.
Candidates must hold a PhD or equivalent in Genetics,
Ecology, Evolution, Bioinformatics, or closely related
area.
This full-time, xed-term post is available immediately
and will be oered until 30th June 2021. ***Extensions
of this term may be possible***
Additional information: To apply for this role please
include a covering letter with your application explain-

Online AvidaED Jul1-2
The 6th annual Avida-ED Active LENS Workshop will
be held July 1 'V 2, 2020. This year, responding to
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, we are holding an
on-line workshop using Zoom.
The purpose of the Active LENS workshop is to train
instructors in the use of the Avida-ED software package,
developed to help students learn about evolution and
the nature of science, so that workshop participants
can both implement classroom interventions using this
software and also train other educators.
Avida is a digital evolution software platform used to
study evolutionary processes, and harness evolution to
solve engineering problems. Avida-ED is a free, browser-
based, user-friendly version of Avida developed speci-
cally for educational purposes, with a graphical user in-
terface and visualizations that allow the user to observe
evolution in action. (Seehttp://avida-ed.msu.edu/for
more information and to run the software in your web
browser.) Organisms within this software (Avidians) are
self-replicating computer programs, competing for com-
putational resources supplied by the environment. Their
replication is imperfect, resulting in mutations in some
of their ospring, which may alter the ability of those
organisms to make use of their environmental resources.
Populations studied over the course of generations there-
fore display all of the elements necessary for evolution
by natural selection: variation, inheritance, selection,
and time. Avida-ED thus provides not a simulation of
evolution, but an actual instance of it.
Avida-ED has been developed for undergraduates and
advanced placement high school students to learn aboutthe nature of science and evolution in particular. Users
have signicant control of the environment and are able
to change parameters such as the world size, the muta-
tion rate, and what resources are available. Individual
organisms can be saved in a virtual freezer, analyzed
individually to watch how they perform tasks and repli-
cate themselves, and used to start new evolutionary
runs. Because digital organisms grow and divide much
faster than even the fastest microbes, Avida-ED allows
users to test evolutionary hypotheses over the course of
hours or minutes. By generating hypotheses, collecting
data, and analyzing results, users will gain experience
not just with concepts in evolution, but with the nature
and practice of science as a whole.
Workshop participants will join a growing community
of educators using digital evolution to let their stu-
dents directly observe evolutionary processes through
inquiry-based exercises that advance reform-oriented
active learning.
The application form for the Active LENS Workshop
must be completed online on the following page:
https://avida-ed.msu.edu/active-lens-train-the-trainers-
workshop-2020-edition/ Registration for the course
is $50. (Note: Participants who complete the course
will receive a certicate and a refund of the course
fee.) All applications received by June 15th will
receive full consideration, but late applications will
be considered if room is available. If you have any

Jul13-Aug15
We are oering a free, virtual short course on Bayesian
phylogenetic inference using RevBayes.
This course will be held during July and early August of
2020 (exact dates are tentative), with particular focus
on (1) tree inference from molecular data, (2) analyses
combining fossil and extant taxa, and (3) evaluating
MCMC performance, with advanced topics including
assessing model adequacy and macroevolutionary anal-
yses. Additional topics may be added depending on the
interests of the selected participants. Participants in the
course will interact with the instructors and one another
as they complete tutorials (detailed lessons on dierent
RevBayes analyses with pre-recorded video guides). Ad-
ditionally, we will hold 5 or more interactive sessions
to discuss and review tutorials and to consult with re-
searchers interested in applying the methods available
in RevBayes to their own data. The dates for the in-
teractive sessions are currently tentative and may be
adjusted depending on the schedules of the participants
and instructors.
We are hoping to identify up to 15 participants for this
online course. While we hope we are able to accom-
modate everyone who applies, we realize that this may
not be possible because of time-zones and availability.
If the number of applicants exceeds our capacity, we
hope to organize a second round of sessions later in the
year. Participants will not be charged for the course,
but we will request that they commit to completing
the tutorials and attending a majority of interactive
sessions.

ONLINE COURSE 'V Reproducible Data Science using
RMarkdown, Git, R packages, Docker, Make & Drake,
and other tools (RDRP01) This course will be delivered
live
29th June - 3rd July
https://www.psstatistics.com/course/reproducible-
data-science-and-r-package-design-rdrp01/ Course
Overview: This course provides a comprehensive
introduction to doing reproducible data analysis, which
we dene as analysis where the entire workow or
pipeline is as open and transparent as possible, making
it possible for others, including our future selves, to
be able to exactly reproduce any of its results. We
cover this topic by providing a thorough introduction
to a set of R based and general computing tools such
as RMarkdown, Git & GitHub, R packages, Docker,
Gnu Make and Drake, and show how they can be
used together to do reproducible data analysis that
can then be shared with others. After a general
introduction on Day 1, where we introduce the core
concept of a research compendium, we will begin by
covering RMarkdown, knitr and related tools. These
are vital tools for reproducible research that allow us
to produce data analysis reports, i.e. articles, slides,
posters, websites, etc., by embedding analysis code (R,
Python, etc) within the text of the report that is then
executed, and the results it produces are inserted into
the nal output document. On Day 2, we provide a
comprehensive introduction to version control using Git,
including using GitHub. Git and GitHub are vital tools
for the organization, maintenance, and distribution
of our code, especially for large scale and long term
projects involving multiple collaborators. On Day 3, we
cover how to create, maintain, distribute R packages.
R packages are obviously the principal means of
distributing reusable R code generally, and here, we will
also look at how R packages can be used also to create,
maintain, and distribute research compendia. On Day
4, we cover Docker, which is a now very popular means
for producing reproducible computing environments
across dierent devices, platforms, and operating
systems. On Day 5, we cover build automation tools,
particularly Gnu Make and Drake, which are used
for automatically running complex analysis code thatJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 87
involves multiple inter-dependencies between les. Gnu
Make is a general purpose build automation tool, while
Drake is specically designed for complex data analysis
pipelines in R. On each day, therefore, we aim to
provide a comprehensive and thorough introduction
to a set of valuable and generally useful computing
tools, each of which plays a key role in allowing us to
do reproducible data science.

<https://sites.massey.ac.nz/iramoana/ >; https://-
sites.massey.ac.nz/iramoana/) are seeking graduate stu-
dents from US institutions whose research has been idled
or who have lost income due to the COVID19 pandemic
to participate in a distributed (remote) datathon.
GEOME (geome-db.org) is a web-based database that
captures the who, what, where, and when of biological
samples and associated genetic sequences. The goal of
the datathon will be to upload to GEOME the geospatial
(latitude and longitude) and collection metadata (habi-
tat, date of sample collection, etc.) that are associated
with biosamples from natural eukaryotic populations
in the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI/INSDC. This
will be accomplished through literature searches, or by
directly contacting the owners/authors of each dataset
we have identied in NCBI.
Interested graduate students who are currently studying
at US universities are invited to ll out a short appli-
cation form <https://forms.gle/8omcKCbbV9o2gS3j8
>, which will include conrmation of their advisor's
support for this activity. We encourage applications
from a diversity of backgrounds. Attention to detail
and strong organizational skills are absolutely essential.
Basic skills with spreadsheets and text les, literature
searches, and writing professional emails are also re-
quired, and preference will be given to applicants with
an interest or experience in population genomics and
genetic biodiversity research. No specic coding skills
are required. Preference will be given to applications
received by midnight PDT on June 29th, and selected
applicants will be informed on July 1st.
Selected applicants will be paid $1500 to handle between
50 and 150 datasets (NCBI BioProjects), equivalent to
100 hours of work. Students will gain skills in data cura-
tion, familiarity with standards in biodiversity research,
and will be able to develop their professional network
through this opportunity. Work will commence on July
6th, 2020 and must be completed by August 21st, 2020.
Students will be expected to attend a 1-2 hour Zoomtraining on July 6th, and a brief weekly Zoom check-in
with GEOME personnel, but otherwise will be able to
work according to their own schedule.

Online IntroductionToFloraOfAlaska
Jun22-Jul20
Dear all,
There are a few spaces left if you are interested in learn-
ing about the Flora of Alaska as well as getting familiar
with some unique approaches to delivering a systematic
botany course online, this might be one for you. One of
the hallmarks of systematic botany courses is the hands-
on learning experience in a laboratory setting. To create
a similar lab experience for the online oering, we have
carefully chosen technology that will allow students from
all over the state (and even outside Alaska) to collect
data in their home communities, perform plant dissec-
tions and have a hands-on learning experience within
the ora's native environment. Instead of traditional
course materials like textbooks, students will purchase
an inexpensive wide-angle macro lens that connects to
their smartphone or tablet. This 2-inch lens lets stu-
dents take high-resolution, detailed photos of ora on
the go with classifying metadata, such as GPS location
attached. The technology not only lets students mimic
lab spaces in their own natural areas but also expands
their digital networks through the submission of images
to iNaturalist, enabling them to share and collaborate
with enthusiasts around the world and contribute citizen
science data to research. Students don't just sit at their
computers in this class, they go outside, touch withJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 89
their hands and share what they discover. The course
design includes carefully videotaped lectures using the
Learning Glass platform, video dissection demonstra-
tions, virtual biome exploration using a 360 camera,
and selected interactive reading materials. This course
is an exciting intersection of curiosity for wild plants,
an exploration of Alaska's plant communities and an
accessible introduction to the science of botany.
Class URL: https://introtoora.community.uaf.edu/
Where: University of Alaska Fairbanks (USA)
Instructor: Dr. Ste Ickert-Bond (Professor of Botany
and Curator of the Herbarium (ALA) at the University
of Alaska Fairbanks)
Course goals:
The objective of this class is to introduce you to several
aspects of Alaska's unique ora. Class modules and
hands-on exercises are designed to familiarize you with
the identication, description, and morphology of our
local ora. In addition, you will get familiar with dis-
section of owers, using technical keys, seeing scientic
(Latinized) names, and learn vocabulary that comes
with describing and talking about plants, and curate im-
ages that you will take of the plants in your immediate
surroundings.
Student learning outcomes:
On completion of this class, you will be able to identify
and describe several common plant families and species
that are native and common to Interior Alaska and
be more comfortable with oral dissection and taking
photographs of owering plants that will aid in their
identication and classication.
Dates: The 1-credit class will run from 22 June- 20 July
and is fully asynchronous.
Registration: You can register at https://-
ecampus.uaf.edu/register/summer-2020-registration/
and select 52841 BIOLF195. The class costs $273.

Nov23-27
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the Physalia course \16
S/ITS Metabarcoding of microbial communities" - ON-
LINE - 23rd -27th November
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course30/ )
Instructors: Dr. Daniel Pass (University of Cardi,
UK); Dr. Xavier Harrison (University of Exeter, UK);
Dr. Bruno Fosso (CNR, Italy); Dr. Anna Sandionigi
(University of Milan Bicocca, Italy)
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
application of metabarcoding techniques in microbial
ecology. The topics covered by the course range from
bioinformatic processing of next-generation sequencing
data to the most important approaches in multivariate
statistics. Using a combination of theoretical lectures
and hands-on exercises, the participants will learn the
most important computational steps of a metabarcoding
study from the processing of raw sequencing reads down
to the nal statistical evaluations. After completing
the course, the participants should be able to under-
stand the potential and limitations of metabarcoding
techniques as well as to process their own datasets to
answer the questions under investigation.
All the best, Carlo

courses-workshops/course27/ )
Instructors: Dr. Amine Namouchi (CEES, University
of Oslo, Norway) and Dr. Claudio Ottoni (University
of Rome Sapienza, Italy)
This course will introduce biologists to the main bioin-
formatics tools for the analysis of Next Generation Se-
quencing (NGS) data from ancient samples. Through
a series of theoretical and practical hands-on sessions,
this course will give you a clear understanding of the
most common bioinformatics methods adopted in a wide
range of paleogenomics projects. During the course we
will cover various steps from metagenomics screening of
ancient samples and taxonomical assignment, to NGS
reads mapping, authentication through post-mortem
damage analysis, variants calling and ltering, and phy-

Online Phylogenomics Nov23-27
Dear all,
the 3rd edition of the Physalia course on Phylogenomics
will take place online from the 23rd to the 27th of
November.
Instructors: Dr. Michael Matschiner and Dr. Milan
Malinsky (University of Basel (Switzerland))
Course website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course21/ Overview: While genomic
data promise unprecedented insights into the evolution
of the tree of life, they also pose new challenges that
must be addressed to avoid misleading results and to
fully leverage the potential of the genome-scale data sets.These challenges include the identication of orthologu-
ous sequences that are suitable as phylogenetic markers,
the selection of appropriate models of sequence evolu-
tion, and the detection of gene-tree discordance due to
incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. In this
workshop we will present theory and exercises to infer
time-calibrated phylogenies from multi-locus, RADseq,
and whole-genome data sets while accounting for these
confounding factors.

Dear all,
registrations are now open for our 5-day ON-
LINE course \RNA-seq Analyses in non-model or-
ganisms": https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course11/ When: 7th-11th December 2020
Instructors: Dr. Nicolas Delhomme and Dr. Bastian
Schithaler (Umea Plant Science Center, Sweden)
Course overview:
This course provides an overview of modern applica-
tions of transcriptome sequencing and popular tools and
algorithms for exploring transcript reconstruction and
expression analysis in a genome-free manner, leveraging
the Trinity software and analysis framework. Attendees
will perform quality assessment of Illumina RNA-Seq
data, assemble a transcriptome using, among others,
Trinity, quantify transcript expression, leverage Biocon-
ductor tools for dierential expression analysis, and
apply Trinotate to functionally annotate transcripts. InJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 91
parallel to the short-read assembly, participants will
perform the pre-processing of 3rd generation sequenc-
ing data (PacBio IsoSeq) and the resulting assemblies
will be compared. Additional methods will then be ex-
plored for characterizing the assembled transcriptome
and revealing biological ndings.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain oldJuly 1, 2020 EvolDir 93
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
