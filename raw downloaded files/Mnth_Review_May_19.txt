Lightning Talk abstracts due 17 May: Early registration
ends
The 2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)
will be held 1-8 July in Freiburg, Germany. GCC brings
together hundreds of faculty, clinicians, researchers, and
students, all working in and supporting data intensive
science that is accessible, sharable and reproducible.
GCC2019 features oral presentations, lightning talks,
posters, demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs),
training, a CollaborationFest, and plenty of opportuni-
ties for networking.
Presentations will cover the full spectrum of Galaxy
applications, enhancements and deployments. If you are
working in data intensive science then GCC2019 is an
ideal conference for sharing your work, learning fromMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 5
others, and nding new collaborators.
Present your work! Abstract submission for talks, light-
ning talks, demos and posters is now open. If you work
in data-intensive science then please consider presenting
your work at GCC2019. This is a chance to present
to 200+ researchers, all addressing challenges in data
intensive science. Review of oral presentations starts on
22 April. Submit an abstract (or two) now!
Registration Early registration starts at 49/day for stu-
dents and postdocs, and 79 / day for other academics
and non-prot researchers. Childcare is available and
travel fellowships are available as well. Early registra-
tion ends 17 May, when rates go up by 60%. So, register
early.
About Galaxy Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org/) is
a platform for data integration and analysis in the life
sciences. It enables researchers to build, run, share, and
repeat their own complex computational analyses using
only a web browser and without having to rst learn
system administration and command line interfaces.
The Galaxy Project is driven by a vibrant community
who publish workows and analyses, wrap new tools,
maintain and enhance the source code, provide support,
and write documentation and training materials. Galaxy
is open-source and freely available, and is deployed in
hundreds of organizations, running on everything from
laptops through supercomputers to public and private
clouds. Over 150 of these platforms are publicly avail-
able and can be used with little or no setup. Thousands
of tools have been ported to Galaxy (\wrapped") and
are deployable from the Galaxy Tool Shed. Galaxy was
developed to support life science research, but the soft-
ware is domain agnostic and is now used in domains
as diverse as natural language processing, constructive
solid geometry, and social science.
We hope to see you in Freiburg! GCC2019 Organizers

GenomicsProbabilisticModeling
Oct6-9
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the 5th Probabilistic Mod-eling in Genomics meeting (ProbGen19), to be held in
Aussois, in the French Alps, Oct 6-9, 2019 (https://-
probgen2019.sciencesconf.org/).
The goal of this meeting is to cover a wide variety of
topics in genomics, ranging from population genomics to
systems biology and cancer genomics, with a particular
focus on the use of novel mathematical and computa-
tional models and inference methods to address timely
and important biological questions. What makes the
meeting special, in our view, is that it has substan-
tial mathematical and theoretical depth yet remains
well grounded in the practical and scientic concerns of
modern genomics. We invite abstract submissions on a
range of topics including functional genomics, molecu-
lar evolution, phylogenetics, epidemiology, methods for
genome-wide association studies, quantitative genetics,
etc.
We will have three keynote speakers: Barbara Engel-
hardt (Princeton University) Gil McVean (Big Data
Institute, University of Oxford) Caroline Colijn (Simon
Fraser University, Vancouver)
Alongside invited speakers, oral presentations will be
selected from submitted abstracts. We particularly en-
courage abstract submissions from junior investigators,
including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. A
few grants will be available for students and postdocs.
Best wishes and hope to see some of you at the meeting,

Ghent Polyploidy Jun11-14
International Conference on Polyploidy
Abstract submission deadline 11 April 2019
The International Conference on Polyploidy will present
cutting edge research into the importance of polyploidy
and whole genome duplication for genetics, evolution
and ecology. For the 2019 meeting, which will take place
at the beautiful city of Ghent, we are trying to put to-
gether an exciting program focusing on many dierent6 EvolDir May 1, 2019
aspects of polyploidy, such as the short- and long-term
ecological and evolutionary consequence of polyploidy
for plant and animal systems, but also polyploidy in
somatic cells and clonal populations will be discussed.
The International Conference on Polyploidy will present
a unique opportunity to meet and discuss with col-
leagues, get updated on the newest developments and
insights into recent and ancient polyploidy and whole
genome duplication, and will provide unique possibilities
to network and discuss collaborations. We are delighted
to announce that Dr. Ilia Leitch (Kew Gardens) has
agreed to deliver the plenary lecture on Tuesday after-
noon, June 11th, opening the meeting.

Goettingen ReticulateEvolution
Nov22-24
Dear colleagues,
the 61st Phylogenetic Symposium with the topic \*Retic-
ulate Evolution*" will take place at the University of
G ottingen from November 22-24, 2019.
Ever since Darwin's theory of evolution suggested a
common ancestry of all life on earth phylogenetic trees
have been used to visualize its relationships. However,
evolutionary histories cannot always be adequately repre-
sented as bifurcating phylogenetic trees. Prime example
is the symbiogenic origin of eukaryotes from the merger
of an archaean and a bacterium. Besides symbiogen-
esis, other processes such as horizontal gene transfer,
hybridization, divergence with gene ow result in retic-
ulation of phylogenetic trees, the origination of lineages
through complete or partial merging of two or more an-
cestor lineages. Reticulate evolution is well documented
across the tree of life, including many examples from
plants and animals. We are looking forward to bring to-
gether experts from dierent backgrounds to summarize
recent progress in the eld of reticulate evolution.

*Marta Barluenga*(Museo Nacional de Ciencias Natu-
rales Madrid, Spain)

Neiman
I wanted to let you know that the Royal Society is
holding a Theo Murphy meeting, Pearls of wisdom: syn-
ergising leadership and expertise in molluscan genomics,
from 16 - 17 September 2019. The meeting is a 2-day
event, held at Chicheley Hall, Buckinghamshire, and
has a poster session for increased networking.
Although molluscs are ecologically, economically, and
medically important, progress in understanding their
biology has been limited by problems associated with
genome sequencing and assembly. As technology break-
throughs overcome these challenges, this meeting will
bring together experts in molluscan biology and ge-
nomics to share best practice in how to use these de-
velopments in elucidating the biology of this diverse
and ill-understood phylum. More information on the
speakers and programme is available on the website
<https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/-

Registration for this meeting is free, but participants
are required to register in advance of the meeting.

Meeting description Genomics tools have never been so
powerful and accessible to biologists interested in how
the interplay between ecological and evolutionary forces
is shaping biodiversity. The 2019 Gordon Research
Conference on Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics
will explore how the genome-scale processes that un-
derpin organismal phenotypes interact with ecological
and evolutionary processes over multiple spatiotemporal8 EvolDir May 1, 2019
scales. The meeting will be preceded by a Gordon Re-
search Seminar (GRS), which will provide opportunities
for early career researchers (students and postdocs) to
present their projects and will include a special men-
torship session. Topics highlighted at the meeting will

The bi-annual meeting of the Italian Anthropological As-
sociation aims at bringing together the various streams
of Biological Anthropology in a three-day long interna-
tional conference. In recent years a number of ground
breaking discoveries have been made possible by sev-
eral technological advances in the elds of ancient and
modern genomics, isotopic analysis and virtual anthro-
pology. Also, new developments in the eld of applied
anthropology have changed our approach to the study
of living and past human populations. All these, and
other topics, will be distilled in this year' conference, in
search of what will be the next relevant research ques-
tions. In addition, a joint symposium with SIBE will
promote a dialogue among invited speakers on \what isa population" and on communication of science.
The conference will be structured in four main sessions,
harboring contributions from all elds of Biological An-
thropology: 1) Hominids and Palaeolithic humans -
covering all subjects up to the Palaeolithic 2) From
prehistory to history - from the Neolithic and Bronze
Age cultural revolutions and demographic expansions all
the way to contemporary populations 3) Contemporary
human populations - mostly based on living populations,
with support from ancient data 4) Applied Anthropol-
ogy - including biomechanics, biomedical, forensic and
all other branches of applied Anthropology.
Looking forward to seeing you all there, Luca Pagani,
Researcher at the University of Padova, Italy on behalf
of the organizing committee

Many organisms across the tree of life have complex
life cycles that include both sexual and asexual repro-
duction or are obligately asexual. Recently, scientists
have been applying both theory and empirical work,
including genomic and genetic studies, to untangle the
evolutionary eects of the amount and timing of sexual
and asexual reproduction.

CallProposals
SMBE Satellite and regional meetings 2020 - call for
proposals
Each year, SMBE provides funds in aid for *SMBESATELLITE MEETINGS*. These are workshops or
small, topically focused regional meetings with fewer
than 100 participants that are organized and held in-
dependent of the SMBE annual meeting. In the past
ve years, SMBE has supported multiple satellite meet-
ings on diverse topics (e.g., \The Origin of Life" 2014,
\Causes of Genome Evolution" 2014, \Phylogenomic
Networks in Microbial Genome Evolution" 2014, \In-
vestigating biological adaptation with NGS: data and
models" 2015, \Mutation, Repair and Evolution" 2015,
\Phylogenetics and Biodiversity" 2015, \Mechanisms of
Protein Evolution III" 2015, \Genome Evolution in
Pathogen Transmission and Disease" 2016, \Genetics
of admixed populations" 2016, \RNA modication and
its implication on adaptation and evolution" 2016, \Mi-
tochondrial Genomics and Evolution" 2017, \Evolution
of microbes in natural and experimental populations
' synthesis and synergies" 2017, \Molecular evolution
and medicine" 2017, \Evolution of genome architecture"
2017, \Molecular evolution and the cell" 2018, \Genome
Evolution in Pathogen Transmission and Disease" 2018,
and \Modern Methods for the study of ancient DNA"
2018)
SMBE is now calling for proposals for work-
shops/satellite meetings to be held between Jan 1st
2020 and Dec 31st 2020. Funds will be awarded on a
competitive basis to members of the molecular evolution
research community to run workshops/satellite meet-
ings on an important, focused, and timely topic of their
choice. The deadline for submission of proposals is May
15th 2019.
*SMBE INTERDISCIPLINARY AND REGIONAL AC-
TIONS*. In addition to supporting its annual meeting
and satellite meetings, SMBE will promote interdisci-
plinary research and extend its actions worldwide by
sponsoring (1) joint meetings with meetings of other
societies; symposia or plenary lectures on molecular bi-
ology and evolution at meetings whose primary focus is
not molecular evolution; (2) regional meetings outside
the US, Europe, and Japan; (3) small regional meetings
in the US, Europe, or Japan targeted towards PhD stu-
dents and postdocs with the purpose of helping them
develop their presentation skills and facilitate network-
ing. Funds will be awarded on a competitive basis to
members of the molecular evolution research community
to run all three types of actions. SMBE is now calling
for proposals to be held between Jan 1st 2020 and Dec
31st 2020. The number of awards will depend on the
quality of proposals and total cost. The deadline for
submission of proposals is May 15th 2019.
*Guidelines*
^A SMBE will provide nancial support for up to 80%May 1, 2019 EvolDir 13
of the cost of each satellite meeting, up to maximum of
$40,000 USD per meeting (most meetings are funded
at $20,000- $30,000 each). SMBE will provide nancial
support for up to 80% of the cost for the joint and
regional meetings, up to maximum of $25,000 USD per
meeting (up to $10,000 USD for small regional meet-
ings in the North America, Europe, or Japan). SMBE
will cover the cost of plenary lectures, up to a maxi-
mum of $3,000 USD per lecture. A detailed projected
budget, including the expected number of participants,
travel/food/lodging costs, and registration fees must be
submitted with the application. Please note that SMBE
funds cannot be used for indirect costs or overhead costs.
*^A* At least one of the organizers must be a member
of SMBE. Current SMBE Council members, or mem-
bers who have rotated-o Council in the last calendar
year, are not eligible to serve as meeting organizers or
co-organizers.
^A For satellite meetings, funds will be awarded on a
competitive basis to members of the molecular evolu-
tion research community that propose an important,
focused, and timely topic. Topics not well represented
in symposia of SMBE annual meetings will be fa-
vored over those that are already well represented at
the annual meetings or previous SMBE satellite meet-
ings. For Interdisciplinary and Regional actions, meet-
ings/symposia/lectures will be selected based on the
scientic importance, timeliness and anticipated impact
on the elds of molecular biology, genome biology, and
evolution.
§Proposals are encouraged to include details for plans
about the recruitment of speakers and participants that
will ensure broad representation across SMBE member-
ship, including gender and geographical location. We
would like to gather information on the number of male
and female speakers, where the speakers are coming from
and their status summarized as senior/mid-career/junior
faculty/trainee. Proposals for meetings to be organized
in geographical areas that have been traditionally under-
represented in SMBE meetings (annual or satellite) are
especially encouraged.
^A Proposals will be received and reviewed by three
SMBE Council Members that will make a recommenda-
tion to SMBE Council, whose decision is nal.

TropicalPlantDiversication
Applications are invited for a PhD fellow-
ship/scholarship at Graduate School of Science
and Technology, Aarhus University, Denmark, within
the Bioscience programme. The position is available
from 1 August 2019 or later. Read more and apply
here: http://phd.scitech.au.dk/for-applicants/apply-
here/may-2019/plant-diversication-in-the-tropics-why-
are-there-so-many-species-in-rainforests/ Title: Plant
diversication in the tropics: why are there so many
species in rainforests?
Research area and project description: Tropical rain-forests are famous for their biological 'hyperdiversity':
they are estimated to harbor around half of the world's
species on less than 10 percent of the world's land surface.
Despite decades, if not centuries, of scientic interest,
this exceptional concentration of biodiversity remains
enigmatic. Evolutionary processes of speciation, extinc-
tion and migration are almost certainly implicated, but
the data to measure them remain scarce. Phylogenetic
methods, drawing on new genomic data, can help getting
new insights into the evolutionary engine of rainforest
hyperdiversity (https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14516).
This PhD project is part of TropiToL, a ve-year project
funded by VILLUM FONDEN aiming to use the Tree of
Life to understand the biological hyperdiversity of trop-
ical rainforests. We will build and apply phylogenetic
trees of plants at dierent scales, and use a combina-
tion of macroevolutionary and ecoinformatics methods
to statistically test dierent candidate drivers of rain-May 1, 2019 EvolDir 17
forest plant diversity. Plants are the structural and
trophic foundation of terrestrial ecosystems, including
rainforests, and can serve as a model to understand the
biological richness of rainforests more broadly. This, in
turn, can help us understand the processes that generate
and maintain high biodiversity in general.
The candidate will work on one or more tropical rainfor-
est plant groups, generating genomic data, building phy-
logenetic trees at species and/or population level, gather-
ing additional data (traits, occurrences) to characterize
species' ecology, and applying cutting-edge macroevo-
lutionary methods to understand (1) what drives spe-
ciation, extinction and migration in tropical rainforest
groups, and (2) how do these processes individually and
in combination aect biodiversity.
The PhD project is likely to focus, at least in part, on
the island of Madagascar, which our team is using as
a model system for understanding the diversication
of tropical forests. The candidate will have access to
existing datasets on the palms of Madagascar, but will
be expected to collect complementary data. There will
be opportunities to conduct eldwork, depending on
the exact scope of the PhD project, which will be deter-
mined in consultation with the successful candidate. An
extended ( >3 months) research stay at a collaborating
institution abroad is expected.
Place of employment and place of work: The PhD stu-
dent will be enrolled in the Graduate School of Science
and Technology (GSST) at Aarhus University. The place
of employment is Aarhus University, and the place of
work will be Section for Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity
(ECOINF), Department of Bioscience, Ny Munkegade
116, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

Job Announcement
PhD position in the eld of mummy microbiome research
Institute for Mummy Studies, Eurac Research, Bolzano,
Italy
We are looking for a microbial ecologist with expertisein advanced molecular, bioinformatics and microscopic
techniques and an interest in applying innovative meth-
ods to the eld of mummy microbiome research. Our
Institute is internationally renowned for its research on
the Iceman and other mummied and skeletal human
remains of dierent periods from all over the world.
Our research aim is to assess the microbiome composi-
tion in mummied human remains. There is increasing
evidence that mummied human remains still contain
traces of the original endogenous microbial community
members. Often, however, this ancient microbiome is
masked by the DNA of post-mortem upgrown organisms
and environmental microbial contaminations. There-
fore, mummy microbiome research can discover both
traces of the ancient host microbiome and metabolic
key-players in the mummy ecosystem that potentially
foster a slow but constant degradation process of unique
mummied remains. The aim of this project is to char-
acterize both the ancient endogenous and still active
microbial community members in mummied human
remains.
The main research objectives are:
* In-depth taxonomic characterization of the microbial
community members in various mummied human re-
mains from all over the world * Comparison of ancient
and modern human microbiomes * Characterization of
the still active microbial community members: Implica-
tions for the conservation of the human mummies.
We oer a three years PhD position at the Eurac Re-
search - Institute for Mummy Studies. The position is
available as early as September 2019.
What we seek We are looking for a highly motivated and
independently working young scientist with a conceptual
and practical background in the application of a holis-
tic microbial ecology approach on the ancient human
remains. To decipher both the ancient endogenous mi-
crobiome and the still active microbial community mem-
bers this holistic approach combines molecular biology
(DNA/RNA based analysis) and shotgun metagenomics
(binning, assembly, taxonomic/functional assignment,
phylogeny) with microscopic analyses of the microbes
(Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation).
Experience in most of the mentioned areas/techniques
is requested. Prociency in spoken and written English
is mandatory.
What we oer We oer up to three years of appoint-
ment as a PhD student according to the salary scheme
of the EURAC. The candidate will work in a young and
international team with a highly stimulation research
environment. The EURAC is an equal opportunity
employer.18 EvolDir May 1, 2019
How to apply Please send an E-mail before 31.05.2019
to mummy.studies@eurac.edu containing a pdf-le with

We are seeking a motivated Ph.D. student to join an
interdisciplinary project combining basic research and
its forensic application for sh species control. The
main focus of the project is on 1) development of the
universal molecular tools for forensic sh species identi-
cation (e.g. in the food trade, sh production), and, 2)
the molecular evolution of parvalbumin genes in shes.
The selected Ph.D. candidate will be focused on the
following topics under the co-supervision of three super-
visors from dierent elds, and will perform the study
at the Charles University in Prague and Food Research
Institute in Prague.
PhD topic title: Molecular characterization of sh par-
valbumin gene and application for sh production con-
trol
Parvalbumin is an important protein of muscle tissue.
Highly conserved exons in the protein-coding part of
the parvalbumin gene are separated by three intons,
which are quite unique among various sh species. This
feature makes nuclear intron sequences convenient as
a molecular marker for PCR-based species determina-
tion, as well as the subsequent Real Time PCR-basedquantication in a complex mixed samples. Results of
the parvalbumin research will be reected in sh species
determination for forensic application in sh trade, food
industry etc. The goal of the research part is to char-
acterize parvalbumin gene (including the number and
sequences of the pseudogenes and/or functional par-
alogs) throughout the ray-nned shes and focus on the
evolution of the genes. Ultimately, this should serve as
a reference for identication of the intron-based PCR
markers for sh species determination.
The research group is located in Prague (Czech Rep.)
and the selected Ph.D. student will process reference
material (collected in the eld or via sh trade), as
well as will have an option to actively participate in
the eld sampling. The project is funded by the Czech
Ministry of Agriculture. Selected candidate is expected
to participate in the development of the forensic tool,
actively participate at scientic conferences and produce
research publications.
Start: October 2019, Duration: 4 years
The salary is composed of the standard university schol-
arship (126'000 CZK) and project employment (84'000
CZK), and can be additionally increased by 24'000 CZK
according to the progress of the study duties, which
in total suciently covers living expenses in the Czech
Republic (student standard).
Required: motivation and enthusiasm for biology, nature
and science; uency in English; a M.Sc. degree in biol-
ogy or related elds (or to be nished until September
2019).
Desirable (but not necessary): previous experience with
laboratory work, especially molecular genetic methods;
(basic) experience with research projects evidenced by
a (co)authorship of research papers or conference con-
tributions.
Deadline: 10th April 2019. Selected candidates will be
then invited for the Skype interview, which will happen
between April 15th - 17th. The nal selected candidate
has to be assigned to the position by the end of April
in order to full the administrative conditions of the

CharlesU MimicryAposematism
A PhD position on aposematism and mimicry at De-
partment of Zoology, Charles University, Prague
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate for a
PhD position to join our project focused on evolution
and maintenance of imperfect mimicry. The selected
PhD candidate will become part of the research team
within the grant project: Mimetic Complexes and the
Evolution of Inaccurate Mimics funded by Czech Science
Foundation (Czech Republic).
Mimicry, a phenotypic resemblance between dierent
species due to the selection by predators, represents one
of intriguing topics in evolutionary biology. Species that
form mimetic complexes may either possess some an-
tipredatory defensive mechanisms or be palatable (form-
ing Batesian- Muellerian continuum), and their mutual
resemblance may be accurate or, in many respects, inac-
curate. In this project, we study two mimetic complexes
of European arthropods: the myrmecomorphic (ant-
resembling) complex formed mainly by ants, true bugs,
and spiders, and the red-and-black complex including
mainly true bugs, beetles, and velvet spiders. We aim
to determine the diversity of these mimetic complexes,
quantify similarities between the mimetic species, and
reconstruct the evolution of their mimetic characters.
We shall compare the ecacy of defensive mechanisms
of the mimetic species against dierent predators (birds,
spiders, mantids, predatory bugs), test how predators
learn, generalize and categorise the mimics, and evaluate
several hypotheses explaining the evolution of inaccurate
mimicry.
The PhD project will be focused mainly on various
aspects of predator cognition (learning, generalisation,
categorisation, decision making), their role in evolution
and maintenance of imperfect mimicry, and their eects
on mimetic relationships between prey species. The
work shall combine behavioural experiments with image
processing and analyses.
Our research group is a part of Department of Zool-
ogy, Faculty of Science, Charles University, and we
are based in Prague (Czech Republic). More informa-
tion about the Department of Zoology and its Ethology
and Ecology Research Group can be found at: http://-
web.natur.cuni.cz/zoologie/eko/en/ . Start date: Octo-
ber 2019. Duration: 4 years.Required: high motivation and genuine enthusiasm for
science in general and for evolutionary and behavioural
ecology in particular; prociency in English; MSc de-
gree in biology or related elds (to be completed until
September 2019).
Desirable (but not necessary): experience with designing
behavioural experiments and with methods of recording
and analysing animal behaviour; advanced statistical
skills; experience with image processing and analysis;
experience with research projects.
Charles University has a 4-year PhD programme in Zool-
ogy; a standard scholarship amounts to 10500 CZK (420
EUR) per month with further increase by up to 4000
CZK (160 EUR) per month according to publication ac-

CharlesU PlantRadiations
A Ph.D. position is available in the research group of
Dr. Roswitha Schmickl at the Department of Botany of
Charles University in Prague.
*Title of the Ph.D. project:* Cytogenomics of a Cape
plant radiation V the role of whole genome duplication
and transposable elements
*Starting date:* October 2019
*Project summary:*
Both the ubiquity of recent polyploids and association20 EvolDir May 1, 2019
of ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events
with evolutionary radiations are frequently taken as
indirect evidence of the adaptive value of polyploidy.
However, in stark contrast to this stands the discovery
that recent polyploids diversify at lower rates, which re-
appraised older notions about polyploids as evolutionary
dead-ends. This Ph.D. project focuses on the radiating
southern African *Oxalis* clade (SoAO). Within-species
ploidy diversity in SoAO is more than three times higher
than global estimates of angiosperm intraspecic ploidy
variation. Within this project it will be tested which
processes lead to the extensive polyploidization in this
plant group and if there is a ploidy-dependent diversi-
cation rate shift. In addition, the role of transposable
elements in radiating SoAO and their interrelation with
WGDs will be addressed. Methods will focus on phy-
logenomic analyses, common garden experiments, and
ow cytometry.
The successful candidate is expected to have a broad
and strong interest in plant evolution, phylogenetics
and bioinformatics. Previous experience in any of these
elds is a plus.

and motivation letter to Roswitha Schmickl

Dr. Philip Bergmann's Evolutionary Functional Mor-
phology Lab at Clark University is recruiting a Ph.D.
student to begin in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020. The
Bergmann lab studies form-function relationships in
an evolutionary and ecological context, primarily using
reptile and amphibian locomotion as a study system.
The main research foci are (1) how form-function rela-
tionships work and are aected by factors such as on-
togeny and substrate, and (2) the evolution of snake-like
body shapes from phenotypic, functional, and ecological
perspectives. Tools used by the lab to address these
questions include high-speed video, force plates, EMG,
dissection, behavioral observations, eld work, and mod-
eling/simulation approaches. Some exciting areas that
might be of interest to new PhD students include the
ontogeny of performance, connecting performance with
habitat use, performance in predator-prey interactions,
and integrating form-function relationships with genetic
architecture of performance traits.
Graduate students should be self-motivated and have
prior research experience. They will be encouraged to
develop their own projects within the context of the
lab research. Interested students should contact Dr.Bergmann (pbergmann@clarku.edu) prior to applying
with any questions they may have, a cover letter that
includes their research interests, CV, and names and
e-mail addresses for two references. The Biology Depart-
ment at Clark University is small but vibrant, providing
students the opportunity to gain experience in research,
teaching, mentoring, and outreach. Support by way of
Teaching Assistantship is guaranteed for ve years, and
includes tuition waiver. Although this year's application
deadline has passed, we are accepting applications.

Title: Global population genetics of Cercospora beticola,
cause of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beets
Summary: Cercospora beticola causes the most impor-
tant fungal disease on sugar beets worldwide. A global
collection of ~1000 strains of C. beticola will be assayed
for 20 SSR markers. Population genetic analyses of these
neutral loci will be used to elucidate global population
structure and infer eective population size, reproduc-
tive mode, and extent of gene ow. 150 of the strains
will be used to conduct an FST/QST analysis to de-
termine the importance of local adaptation in selected
populations. Using complete genome sequences from
these 150 strains, a GWAS will be conducted to identify
candidate genes underlying each trait.
Description: Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) caused by the
fungus Cercospora beticola (Cb) is an important disease
on sugar beets. CLS is typically controlled with fungi-
cides, but resistance has become a problem in many
locations and there would be economic and ecological
benets associated with using genetic resistance instead
of fungicides to control CLS. Cb populations in Europe
and North America have already shown their ability
to evolve resistance to fungicides, but it is unknown
how they will respond to deployment of CLS resistant
cultivars.
Pathogen population genetic structure has proven to22 EvolDir May 1, 2019
be one of the best predictors of pathogen evolutionary
potential. The core of this project is oriented around
obtaining a detailed understanding of the population
genetics of Cb to provide insight into the distribution
of gene and genotype diversity within and among Cb
populations sampled from dierent regions around the
world. The results will enable quantitative assessments
of the importance of sexual recombination, gene ow and
eective population size, all of which aect a pathogen's
evolutionary potential. This comprehensive population
genetic analysis can be used to develop an overall risk
assessment model for Cb that would consider both the
evolution of virulence against resistance genes and the
emergence of fungicide resistance. The analysis will
also consider the potential for long-distance gene and
genotype ow and the likely importance of sexual re-
combination.
In the rst phase of the project, the student will obtain
completely assembled PacBio genome sequences for 2
European strains of Cb and Illumina genome sequences
for 10 additional strains of Cb. These genome sequences
will be used to identify 20 robust SSR loci that can be
assayed in ~1000 global strains of Cb, with 30-50 strains
coming from each sugar beet eld. The SSR data will
be collected from all global strains and used to conduct
detailed population genetic analyses.
In the second phase of the project, the student will iden-
tify~150 global Cb strains to use in an FST/QST anal-
ysis. FST/QST analyses provide a powerful approach
to identify quantitative traits that are under selection
for local adaptation, as shown in our earlier work with
three other fungal plant pathogens. In the framework of
the FST/QST analysis, we will collect phenotypic data
for a series of in vitro traits, including melanization, and
growth rates at dierent temperatures, in the presence
or absence of fungicides and in the presence or absence
of reactive oxygen stress provided by hydrogen perox-
ide. For each trait, we will partition the phenotypic
variance into components reecting variance within eld
populations and between eld populations (i.e. QST)
and compare this to the distribution of neutral genetic
variance for SNP markers (i.e. FST) distributed among
the same populations. The SNP markers will be based
on complete genome sequences obtained from each of
the 150 strains used in the FST/QST analysis.
In the third phase of the project, the student will use the
phenotype data collected in the FST/QST analysis and
the SNP data obtained from the 150 genome sequences
to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
aiming towards determining the genetic architecture of
each quantitative trait and identifying candidate genes
underlying each trait.Qualications of the applicants: Applicants should have
a masters degree in bioinformatics, biology, microbiology
or a similar qualication. Previous experience in popu-

We are seeking a highly motivated student for a PhD-
position based at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow,
Poland, as part of the project \The role of environmen-
tal factors in maintaining adaptive pace-of-life variationMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
in a mammal holobiont: an experimental evolution ap-
proach."
Our aim is to investigate how environmental constraints
experienced at dierent life stages inuence the tness
of the mammal \holobiont". According to the holo-
biont hypothesis an animal and its microbiome coevolve
and should respond to the environment as a unit. To
test this idea, we will study the eects of environmen-
tal manipulations on the life history and physiology of
the individual animal and associated changes in its gut
microbiome (the community of commensal microbes in-
habiting the gut). We will test hypotheses about the
role of the microbiome in inuencing the tness of the
animal host through lab and eld experiments with
established bank vole (Myodes glareolus) selection lines.
The student will have an opportunity to conduct ex-
periments with captive voles in Krakow and participate
in eld experiments conducted in large eld enclosures
in central Finland. The project oers opportunities
to learn state-of-the-art methods and a range of trans-
ferable skills, including physiological measurements, ge-
nomic analyses of the gut microbiome and the associated
bioinformatics and statistical analyses. The student will
collect and analyse data and prepare publications in
close collaboration with an international team of re-
searchers at the Jagiellonian University, Poland (Dr
Anni H am al ainen, Prof Pawel Koteja) and the Univer-
sity of Jyv askyl a, Finland (Prof Phillip Watts, Dr Tapio
Mappes, Dr Esa Koskela).
The successful candidate will have an MSc degree in a
relevant eld by July 2019; evidence of good quantita-
tive/computational skills; and strong English language,
communication, organizational and collaboration skills.
Previous experience with small mammals, microbial
communities, bioinformatics, animal physiology and/or
evolutionary biology are considered advantageous. The
prospective student receives a generous stipend from
the National Science Centre grant for 3 years, and a sup-
plement to attend conferences and travel for eld work.
The ocial start date in the PhD program (graduate
school) will be October 1st, 2019, but there may be a
possibility for an interested student to begin earlier as
a summer assistant.

InsectSymbioses
The new Symbiosis Evolution research group
(www.symbioses.pl) at the Institute of Environmental
Sciences of Jagiellonian University in Krak ~A^A3w,
Poland is seeking a motivated Ph.D. Student to join the
project \The evolutionary dynamics of the symbioses
of Auchenorrhyncha", funded by the Polish National
Science Centre (NCN) Sonata Bis 8 grant.
The project will comprehensively describe the evolu-
tionary processes and patterns related to microbial sym-
bioses of hemipteran insects from the suborder Auchenor-
rhyncha (cicadas, spittlebugs, leafhoppers, treehoppers,
and planthoppers). These specialized microbes pro-
ducing essential nutrients have been transmitted from
mothers to ospring for a very long time ' as much as
300 million years in some cases. But in many Auchenor-
rhyncha lineages, these ancient symbionts have become
replaced or complemented by other microorganisms. We
will describe the incidence and nature of these symbiont
replacements, the origins of the replacing microbes, their
genomic evolutionary patterns, their current biological
roles, and the eects of the replacements on the ecology
and evolution of hosts. Initially, we will conduct broad
microbiome screens and reconstructions of the symbiont
replacement patterns across the taxonomic diversity of
Auchenorrhyncha. We will then follow up with phy-
logenomic, comparative genomic, and microscopy-based
analyses of symbionts in clades that have experienced
the replacements.
The Ph.D. Student will focus on bioinformatic recon-
struction of the symbiont co-diversication and replace-
ment patterns, and on phylogenomic analyses of the
host and symbiont relationships. They will also have
an opportunity to participate in international eldwork,
process the collected insects, conduct molecular work
(automated DNA extraction, next-generation sequenc-
ing library preparation), and work on the reinterpreta-
tion of older, extensive microscopy data. They will be
encouraged to work closely with project collaborators,
including Gordon Bennett (University of California -
Merced), Insect Biome Atlas consortium members in
Sweden, and Anna Michalik (Jagiellonian University).
The successful candidate will have an M.Sc. degree in
a relevant eld by July 2019; a demonstrated interest
in Evolution, Entomology, Microbiology, and/or Ge-26 EvolDir May 1, 2019
nomics; experience with, or a keen interest in learning,
Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology; and strong
English language, communication, and organizational
skills. Previous experience with insect ecology, evolution
and especially symbioses, molecular biology, microbiome
surveys, phylogenomics and/or comparative genomics,
as well as German language skills and willingness to
travel, are advantageous.
The student will receive a generous 48-month tax-free
stipend funded from the grant. Additional scholarships
may be available through Ph.D. programs of Jagiellonian
University. The ocial start date of the Ph.D. program
is October 1st, 2019, but depending on the student's
interest, there may be a possibility of an earlier start as
a research assistant.
The candidates are asked to submit a cover letter, a
CV, and contact details of two references to Dr. Piotr
~A ukasik (p.lukasik@gmail.com). The review of applica-
tions starts on 10th May 2019. The selected candidate or
candidates will be assisted with the formal application
to the Ph.D. program at Jagiellonian University.

GenomicSelection
Dear All,
I announce a PhD position in genomic selection to
improve Pacic oyster quality to work at Ifremer in
La Tremblade. The project is already funded. Please
contact Pierre Boudry (Pierre.Boudry@ifremer.fr) and
Jean-Baptiste Lamy (Jean.Baptiste.Lamy@ifremer.fr)
for further information.
Project description Some phenotypic traits of the oyster
are essential for adaptation to farming environment and
also have an added commercial value, such as thickness
of the oyster shell, strength of the adductor muscle, meat
yield, resistance to viral and/or bacterial infection and
biochemical composition. The measurements of those
traits are destructive and hardly adapted to a large num-
ber of individuals ( >1000 individuals) as it is routinely
done in various breeding programs of French hatcheries.
Such phenotyping objectives require some technological
and methodological developments. In addition, the re-
cent progress and cost reduction of genotyping technolo-
gies allows the joint analysis of genetic and phenotypic
dataset on a large number of individuals to explore the
genomic determinism of such traits and test the eec-
tiveness of genomic selection breeding schemes. This
thesis aims to test and optimize the implementation of
genomic selection methods, particularly for commercial
traits as above-mentioned in Pacic oyster.
The founder populations will be genotyped on 20000 loci
in order to have an initial image of their consanguinity
and to follow its evolution. The thesis aims are to setup
protocols, statistical pipelines and demonstrate the fea-
sibility of such breeding scheme for the industry with
an explicit control of the broodstock genetic diversity,
mandatory for the genetic sustainability of the founder
populations.
Keywords: Genomic selection, quantitative genetics,
population genomics, high-throughput phenotyping, con-
sanguinity, relatedness, traceability, sustainability.

A Ph.D. position is available at the Masaryk Univer-

Republic
Application deadline: April 20, 2019 Starting date: Oc-

Title: Evolution of hybrid male sterility in the European
house mouse
Supervisor: Jaroslav Pi alek, CSc.
Subject: Two house mouse subspecies, Mus m. musculus
and M. m. domesticus, that diverged between 0.5 MYR,
undergo recipient speciation. Laboratory based crosses
between the subspecies readily document the presence of
F1 sterile males. This sterility is controlled by epistatic
interaction between 2 loci, the Prdm9 gene on chromo-
some 17 and X-linked gene(s) Hstx1/2, pleiotropically
also controlling meiotic recombination. However, no
laboratory borne sterility was reported from a natural
hybrid zone between the subspecies. Here we address
this incongruity by assessing variation of sterility in 648
intersubspecic crosses between 40 wild-derived strains
from the Western Palearctic. Genotype-phenotype asso-
ciations will be tested to the 2-locus model and, in those
that dier, quantitative trait loci (QTL) will be mapped
in the genome. Immunostaining of meiotic crossovers
will search for geographic signal of within- and intersub-
specic recombination rates. Finally, linking the QTL
signal to mouse strain phylogeny, we will infer a general
model of evolution of hybrid male sterility and genome-
wide recombination in the house mouse. Experimental
work will be realized in a breeding facility of the Institute
of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, in
Studenec (https://www.ivb.cz/pracoviste/detasovane-
pracoviste-studenec/ ). The study is supported by the
Czech Science Foundation in 2019'2021.May 1, 2019 EvolDir 29

ShrewBrainSizeChanges
PhD student wanted for a project on reversible brain
size changes in the common shrew.
In our long-term project on the evolution of reversible
individual size changes in small high-metabolic mam-
mals we have an open position for a 3-year PhD starting
as soon as possible but hopefully before June this year.
You would be working with captive shrews and study
them as they go through the size changes in the brain
using a combined approach of repeated state-of-the-art
MRI imaging and behavioural assays of the same indi-
viduals. The MRIs will be done in the group of Dominik
von Elverfeldt in Freiburg, where you will spend part of
your time (https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/mr-en/-
members/current/elverfeldt.html).
This is a HSFP-funded collaborative project with Lil-
iana Davalos from Stony Brook University (looking
at the molecular basis of this phenomenon) and John
Nieland from Aalbord University (looking at the lipid
metabolism) and their students.
What we are looking for:
If you are fascinated by evolution and questions such as
how seasonal change aects animals, how the brain is
shaped by evolutionary pressure, or how brain size is
linked to behaviour and cognitive abilities this may be
the right position for you. You need to be enthusiastic
about working in a team and sharing data.
Ideal would be if you are a biologist with also a back-
ground in or inclination for physics or bioimaging as
the MRI (which we will be the rst to do with shrews)
will be a large and important part of the project. Good
English skills are also a requirement.
What you will nd:
The Max Planck Institute for Ornithology is a thriving
center for research on animal behaviour and our grouphas been working on these shrews for years, working out
many (but not all) of the potential kinks of working with
the sensitive shrews. Our graduate school IMPRS for
Organismal Biology provides added background where
you can prot from a large spectrum of courses and
support.
Interested? Please send your CV, a motivation letter
and a research statement to ddechmann@orn.mpg.de by
May 15th.

Natural History Museum PhD Research Fellowship in
Evolutionary Biology/Ornithology
Job description A PhD fellowship (SKO 1017) is avail-
able at the Natural History Museum (NHM), University
of Oslo. The position is placed in the ?Sex and Evolu-
tion Research Group? (SERG). The fellowship period is
for 4 years, with 3 years in total devoted to carrying out
a research project and one year (25%) of compulsory
work load that will consist of teaching and supervision
duties, collection work, outreach activities and research
assistance. No one can be appointed for more than one
PhD Research Fellowship period at the University of
Oslo. Starting date no later than 01.10.2019.
More about the position The research themes in the
SERG group are concentrated on the importance of sex,
sex roles and sexual conict in shaping evolutionary
processes such as speciation, hybridization, diversi-
cation and adaptation. These processes are studied
at dierent levels of organization, like genes, genomes,
gametes, individuals, populations and species. Most
projects use birds as their study systems. In recent
years, the SERG group has mainly worked on these
particular questions: ?Why are females promiscuous??,
?Why are sperm cells so diversied within and among
species? ? and ?What are the roles of pre- and postcop-
ulatory sexual selection in reproductive isolation and
speciation?? The research projects usually employ a
combination of in-depth descriptive studies of morphol-
ogy and behaviour, eld experiments and comparative
approaches. The research group has access to large mu-
seum collections in ornithology, including a DNA bank
of more than 60 000 tissue samples, and a unique collec-
tion of formalin-preserved sperm cells from more than
500 species. Other available research infrastructures
are a modern DNA laboratory, computer-assisted sperm
analysis (CASA), microscopes with imaging software,
and electron microscopes.Detailed population studies
are usually carried out on target species around Oslo or
at the NHM eld station in ?vre Heimdalen, whereas
eldwork for comparative studies is usually carried out
abroad and in collaboration with other institutions and
research groups.
We invite a highly motivated and dedicated student to
develop a PhD project within the framework of SERG?s
research themes as outlined above, and in close collab-
oration with the scientic sta in the group. We oer
a specic project designed to understand how various
forms of selection can aect variation in sperm size
and function in passerine birds, though we assume that
the successful candidate will actively contribute to the
development of the specics of the research plan.Qualication requirements A Master?s degree in ecol-
ogy, evolution or molecular biology Skills in relevant

Natural History Museum PhD Research Fellowship in
Evolutionary Genomics and Zoology
Job description A PhD fellowship (SKO 1017) is avail-
able at the Natural History Museum (NHM), University
of Oslo. The position is placed in the research group
\Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology". The fellowship pe-
riod is for 4 years, with 3 years in total devoted to
carrying out a research project outlined below, and 1
year a compulsory work load (25 %) that will consist
of teaching and supervision duties, collection work, out-
reach activities and research assistance. No one can be
appointed for more than one PhD Research Fellowship
period at the University of Oslo. Starting date no later
than 01.10.2019.
More about the position The PhD project will address
the foundations of speciation and dispersal in intertidal
invertebrates characterized by seemingly no dispersal
capacity. Many invertebrate species have very wide
distribution ranges, but seemingly no or very low dis-
persal capacities. Some cases are known, for example,
as the \Meiofauna paradox". However, detailed stud-
ies of some traditionally recognized widespread species
revealed complexes of cryptic species. Regardless of
whether the distant populations are conspecic or be-
long to dierent cryptic species, two general questions
can be asked: \Why are these taxa from distant ar-
eas so similar?" and \How can they have dispersed
over long distances and occupied distant shores in the
absence of propagative stages?". The beetle genus Ae-
gialites is widely distributed across the northern Pacic
Ocean shores, both in Asia and North America where
the beetles live on coastal rocks ooded at high tides
or sprinkled by waves. These beetles are wingless and
have no obvious adaptations to dispersal, yet they oc-
cur even on some distant islands that have never been
connected to continents. The rst aim of this project
is to investigate the evolutionary history of this genus
and to test if speciation is driven by vicariance or not.
Second, the genome of an Aegialites species will be
determined to allow genome re-sequencing approaches
for the next hypotheses to be tested. Third, genome
re-sequencing approaches will be applied to understand
the dispersal capacity of Aegialites species at dierent
geographical scales and, fourth, to test if hybridization
between Aegialites species occurs possibly explaining
their high morphological similarity. The results will
contribute to answering the two more general ques-
tions above. Even though eld work will be conducted
to ll gaps in existing material, it will be necessaryto complement these with historical museum material.
Therefore, in this project both classical zoological and
population and evolutionary genomic approaches will
be explored including the usage of historical museum
material for molecular studies (often called museomics).
The Natural History Museum has a modern DNA labo-
ratory. The PhD will be associated with the research
group \Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology", specically
Torsten Struck (Professor of Evolutionary Genomics)
and Vladimir Gusarov (Associate Professor of Entomol-
ogy).
Qualication requirements A Master's degree or equiva-
lent in biology or related disciplines like bioinformatics.
Strong motivation for research in zoology and/or ge-
nomics. Skills in general molecular laboratory practices
Experience with next-generation sequencing of genomes
and working with small amounts of tissue material (i.e.,
whole genome amplication) is preferable. Computing
skills and background in bioinformatics are expected for
handling and analyzing large data sets emerging from
next-generation sequencing approaches. Background in
entomology, particularly knowledge of beetle morphol-
ogy and systematics, will be an advantage. Communi-
cation skills (including written and spoken English)

PhD Position in Evolutionary Ecology: Dynamics of
immigration, inbreeding and tness in song sparrows
We have a fully-funded PhD position in Evolutionary
Population Ecology available at the Centre for Biodi-
versity Dynamics, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.
The Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics is a leading cross-disciplinary Centre of Excellence, with primary interests
in population ecology, evolutionary biology and com-
munity dynamics. It works at the interface between
biology and mathematical sciences, and strives to apply
cutting-edge theoretical and statistical frameworks to
eld data to resolve key questions in the context of both
fundamental and applied science. Further information
is available at http://www.ntnu.edu/cbd About the
project Population and evolutionary dynamics depend
critically on the outcomes of dispersal events among
sub-populations, and resulting spatial movements of
individuals and genes. Immigration and resulting ge-
netic introgression can increase sub-population tness
by alleviating local inbreeding (i.e. 'genetic rescue'), but
can also decrease sub-population tness by introducing
alleles that are locally maladaptive (i.e. 'immigration
load'). Yet, it remains unclear how such eects can
work together to increase or decrease the chance of lo-
cal population persistence in the short-term and the
longer-term.
This PhD project will use exceptional long-term data
from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to
dissect the short-term and longer-term eects of im-
migrants on population genetic composition and local
tness. It will also aim to bring together strands of evo-
lutionary theory to provide new insights into the com-
pound evolutionary eects of immigration in fragmented
populations with inbreeding and local adaptation.
The student will work with Professors Jane Reid and
Henrik Jensen at NTNU, with strong collaborative links
with Professor Peter Arcese and Dr Pirmin Nietlisbach
(University of British Columbia, Canada), and Professor
Lukas Keller (University of Zurich, Switzerland).
Job description The PhD project will involve sophisti-
cated statistical analysis of existing long-term eld data,
and theory development using mathematical and/or
simulation approaches. There will be opportunities to
participate in eldwork and further research training
in Canada and Switzerland. The project would suit a
highly motivated and numerate student with enthusiasm
for confronting evolutionary theory with eld data. Full
training in key aspects of the project, and associated
transferable skills, will be provided. The position pro-
vides an excellent opportunity for students who wish to
qualify for future work in research positions.
Qualication requirements We seek candidates who have
a strong academic record and interests in quantitative
evolutionary ecology and/or population biology, of any
nationality and country of educational origin. The work-
ing language will be English. The qualication require-
ment is completion of a master's degree or second degree
(equivalent to 120 credits) in biology or equivalent edu-34 EvolDir May 1, 2019

Dear All,
I announce a PhD position in evolutionary genomics
on recombination and plant genome evolution to work
at the ECOBIO lab in Rennes (https://ecobio.univ-
rennes1.fr). The project is already funded but the can-
didates will have to take the EGAAL doctoral school con-
test (https://ed-egaal.u-bretagneloire.fr) in June. The
position will then start in October 2019. Please contact
me for further information.

Project description Recombination is a central mecha-
nism of eukaryotes life cycle. It allows genetic mixing
during meiosis, which create new genetic combinations
every generations, increasing genetic diversity and the
ecacy of selection Recombination also has local molec-
ular consequences as the very chromosomic poistion
where it occurs, as it involves DNA break and repair
mechanisms. In many species, these repair mechanims
arre biased towards G and C nucleotides, which leads to
apparent selection for GC (aka GC-biased gene conver-
sion, gBGC). gBGC enriches genome in G and C and
can conteract natural selection. Characterizing recombi-
nation paterns and their consequences is thus crucial to
understand genome evolution and how species respond
selection and adapt ot their environment. Flowering
plants oers a highe variation in genomic characteristics:
genome size, number of chromosomes, recombination
rate, GC content. However, despite these striking vari-
ations, the study of base compositions is rather recent
compared to animal species and recombination patternsMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 35
have been characterized in a handful of plant species
only. The working hypothesis of the project is that vari-
ations in recombination patterns contribute to genomic
diversity for genetic diversity, selection ecacy and base
composition. More precisely: - Is GC content higher in
highly recombining species and genomic regions? - Does
recombination increase genetyic diversity and the e-
cacy of selection? - Do these eects vary among species
at the owering plant scale? Comparative approach will
be used in more than 50 species representing the ma-
jor groups of owering plant phylogeny using publicaly
available data: full genome sequences, genetic maps,
polymorphism data (from full genome re-sequencing
data).
The project will require knowledge in molecular evolu-
tion/evolutionary genomics/population genetics, bioin-
formatics or skills in programmation, and statistics.

RyersonU PlantPopulationBiology
*The Opportunity*
The Campbell lab is recruiting graduate students (MSc
and PhD) and a research technician! Our research links
evolutionary and ecological processes in plant popu-
lation biology. In particular, reproductive processes
are highly labile in plants with immediate evolution-
ary, phenotypic, and demographic consequences. So, we
study plant populations and their genetic systems (the
reproductive machinery and processes that inuence
gamete quality and quantity, gamete dispersal, mating,
fecundity and, ultimately, adaptive evolution). To ac-
complish this work we bring together folks with diverse
skill sets and we're attempting to approach these topics
with disruptive technologies. Thus, we're looking for
folks with backgrounds in horticulture and plant sci-
ence, public relations and citizen science, biochemistry,
physics/computer science, and, of course, ecology or evo-
lution. Current research projects ask questions around
genetic and environmental control of quantitative ge-
netic trait expression, plant mating and dispersal, and
genotype-by-environment interactions, and all projects
solve basic and applied questions in plant population
biology. Positions start no later than September 1, 2019.Located in downtown Toronto, Ryerson University is
a distinctly urban, culturally diverse teaching and re-
search institution oering more than 100 undergraduate
and graduate programs, distinguished by a strong com-
mitment to excellence in teaching, research and creative
activities, to over 45,000 students. Ryerson is known
for its culture of entrepreneurship and innovation and is
recognized as a city builder, as it continues its growth
through award-winning architecture and expansion of
its campus. From our lab, trainees have found careers
in academia (as professors and lab research technicians),
scientists (horticultural managers, breeders, research di-
rectors, health care workers, municipal water scientists),
and teachers (in both public outreach and high school
science).
*Responsibilities*
The successful candidate for the research technician
position will engage in a combination of research, ad-
ministrative and management duties. The candidate will
be expected to carry out analytical chemical assessment
of plant material (which will contribute to peer-reviewed
research), potentially develop lab-specic protocols, as
well as maintain standard operating protocols of the lab.
The candidate will contribute to mentoring undergradu-
ate and graduate students to facilitate junior scholars'
research and education. Given that this candidate will
be an integral part of many projects, we are looking for
someone who is the 'social glue' in a group! The candi-
date will engage in maintaining an inclusive, equitable,
and collegial work environment across all activities.
The successful candidates for the graduate student posi-
tions will engage in a combination of research (through
paid RAships), teaching (through paid TAships), and
service, as well as a typical classwork load. The candi-
date will be mentored through the process of developing
and carrying out independent research projects within
funded themes, applying for their own sources of fund-
ing, and publishing in peer-reviewed forums. We are
seeking candidates for both MSc and PhD positions.
We are looking for folks who are collegial, inclusive and
promote equity in all that they do. We want a wonderful
colleague and collaborator.
*Qualications: *
Candidates for the research technician position should
have a MSc in analytical chemistry or closely related eld
by the appointment date. Note, that we will consider
applicants with either a BSc in analytical chemistry
AND practical experience in analytical chemistry in-
dustry positions with at least one publication (either
peer-reviewed journal article or patent).
The successful candidate must present strong re-36 EvolDir May 1, 2019
search experience and provide strong endorse-
ments/recommendations by referees on their abilities as
an analytical chemist.
Evidence of, or potential for, excellence in mentoring
and collaborative work must be provided through de-
scriptions of mentoring and research collaboration ac-
complishments. Please demonstrate evidence of strong
communication skills and a demonstrated ability to work
with and potentially lead a team.
Candidates must have a commitment to our values of
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) as it pertains to
mentoring and scholarly research, including a demon-
strated ability to make learning accessible and inclusive
for the diverse student population that works in our lab.
*Equity at Ryerson *
At the intersection of mind and action, Ryerson is on a
transformative path to become Canada's leading com-
prehensive innovation university. Integral to this path
is the placement of equity, diversity and inclusion as
fundamental to our institutional culture. Our current
academic plan outlines each as core values and we work
to embed them in all that we do. It is a central tenet of
the Campbell lab.

We are looking for a doctoral student for the project
\New eective methods for the processing of timothy".
Timothy is the most cultivated forage grass in Sweden,
but climate change and altered cultivation conditions
have accelerated the need for new, well-adapted tim-
othy varieties to maintain high cultivation eciency
throughout Sweden. Swedish agriculture is therefore in
great need of a more ecient domestic plant breeding
of timothy. The aim of the project is to develop and
introduce new, more ecient plant breeding methods,
based on the latest achievements in plant genomics and
genetics, in order to shorten the time and reduce the
cost of breeding in Timothy.
The position is placed at the Department of Plant Biol-
ogy at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences(SLU), Uppsala, Sweden. The department conducts

science, chemistry and biotechnology. The department
is also part of the Linnean Center for Plant Biology
in Uppsala, a platform for interactions between plant
researchers at SLU and Uppsala University. Uppsala is
also hosting a SciLifeLab node that provides national
platforms for sequencing, proteomics and microscopy.
The candidate should have a suitable master's degree in
biology, agronomy or an equivalent education. You will
work closely with other researchers and graduate stu-
dents in a creative and stimulating environment. There-
fore, you should have an easy time working with others

A fully-funded 4 years PhD position in experimental
evolution is available at the School of Biological Science,
University of Aberdeen, UK.
Title: Joint eco-evolutionary dynamics of dispersal and
female multiple mating: empirical test. Supervisors: Dr.
Greta Bocedi, Dr. Lesley Lancaster
This PhD project will use experimental evolution on the
seed beetle model species, Callosobruchus maculatus, to
study the joint eco-evolutionary dynamics of dispersal,
mating system and inbreeding. We will test emerging
theoretical predictions on how dispersal and mating sys-
tem co-vary in space, how they jointly evolve, and the
consequences for species' responses to changing environ-
ments. The ability of individuals to move (dispersal) to
avoid the negative consequences of inbreeding (mating
with self or relative), and the acquisition and choice
of mates (mating system) are fundamental for species'
persistence. Dispersal and mating system determine
how genes are transmitted across generations and in
space, and genetic variation ultimately determines a
species' potential to adapt to new conditions. Addition-
ally, although they have been studied largely separately,
dispersal and mating system are tightly interconnected.
Female multiple mating, in particular, is a component
of the mating system that is now being shown to be
widespread across organisms and to have far-reaching
consequences for species evolution and potentially for
species' responses to environmental changes1. As with
dispersal2, female multiple mating is thought to evolve
to allow inbreeding avoidance3,4. However, we still do
not know how these two fascinating behaviours aect
each other's evolution and feed back to the population
inbreeding level, how environmental changes impact
their evolution and what this means for species' per-
sistence. We are developing theoretical predictions on
how we should expect dispersal and female multiple
mating to jointly evolve as a consequence of population
structure and environmental changes, and to impact
on species' survival. With this project the student will
start testing this theory in the laboratory using a model
species for the study of mating system and dispersal, the
seed beetle5,6. The student will create microcosms with
multiple populations of beetles where we will be able
to test for joint evolution of dispersal, female multiple
mating and level of inbreeding in both static environ-May 1, 2019 EvolDir 39
ments and under range expansion conditions. Using
next generation sequencing approaches, the student will
be able to assess genetic variants and frequency shifts
putatively involved in the evolution of dispersal and
polyandry. This project will therefore provide a neces-
sary step change in experimental study of dispersal and
mating system by fully accounting and testing for their
interactions and eco-evolutionary feed-backs, and thus
start making headway in understanding how these two
behaviours might jointly evolve in real organisms.
This project oers the student the opportunity to gain
training in experimental evolution, quantitative genetics
and genomic analyses. Further, the student will join a
group that is strong in eco-evolutionary modelling and
will have the opportunity of receiving excellent train-
ing on theory development and modelling. Candidates
should have (or expected to achieve) a minimum of 2:1
Honours degree, ideally (but not required) an MSc in
ecology, evolution or related, strong theoretical skills
and passion and enthusiasm for developing experimental
evolution studies.
The PhD is funded 100% by The Royal Society and
the funding has already been secured. The studentship
covers the registration fees (for UK/EU students), the
student salary for 4 years, experimental costs and travel
for training and conference attendance for the student.
Expected starting date is 1st October 2019.

UBasel 2 EvolutionRangeLimits
Two PhD Positions in Evolutionary Ecology, 100%
Working with Yvonne Willi in the Plant Ecology and
Evolution group at the University of Basel, Switzerland.
Positions are funded by the Swiss National Science Foun-
dation (SNF) for a duration of 4 years. The goal is to
understand the causes of geographic range limits ? why
evolution fails at the warm and cold end of species dis-
tribution. The research is fundamental to evolutionary
biology, ecology, global change research and environmen-
tal stress research.
The evolutionary causes of geographic range limits are
poorly known. Theory points to changes in the selection40 EvolDir May 1, 2019
regime and genetic limitations. The selection regime
may be important if environmental gradients steepen
at the edge of the distribution. Genetic limits may
arise because of low genetic variation in individual envi-
ronmental tolerances or because of genetic correlations
antagonistic to the direction of selection.
Your Tasks Working with the plant Arabidopsis lyrata,
the two students will perform crossing experiments and
selection experiments in the eld, assess performance
under stressful conditions representative of distribution
edges, and conduct whole-genome sequencing. Field-
work will take place in eastern states of the US, in
collaboration with local universities.
Your Prole Candidates should have an enthusiastic
interest in plants and their evolution, and a strong back-
ground in quantitative thinking, experimental design,
statistical analysis/bioinformatics, and rearing plants.
Applicants must have a university degree in the natural
sciences that allows entrance to a PhD program (ide-
ally in evolutionary biology or ecology), and very good
organizational, analytical, and scientic writing skills.
Applicants should have a driver?s license.

UBern FishEvolutionaryEcol
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, Department of Fish Ecology and Evo-
lution (FishEc) has a vacancy for a PhD student in Fish
Evolutionary Ecology.
Applicants should have or anticipate nishing an MSc
or similar before the summer 2019 in a relevant eld of
biology, ecology, or environmental science and a strong
interest in evolutionary ecology, life history variation,
adaptive radiation and animal/sh migration.
Movement is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of
animals, and the movement of individual organisms is
integral for many vital ecological and evolutionary pro-
cesses. Migration is one of nature?s most spectacular
forms of animal movement and has a long and illumi-
nating scientic history, with exciting new discoveries
year after year. Centuries of research on animal migra-
tion have highlighted that migratory individuals most
often show distinct adaptations to the migratory travel
and prot from temporally changing relative benets
of alternative habitats. However, being migratory also
means experiencing natural selection in at least two
dierent habitats. Unfortunately, our knowledge on
adaptation to a migratory life style is typically limited
to adaptation to the migratory travel per se. Knowledge
about all aspects of migratory versus non-migratory life
history is crucially needed in order to understand the
ecological dynamics of natural selection over space and
time.
To enable strong empirical research on the ecological-
and evolutionary aspects of animal migration, replicate
study systems are needed. This is for many of the classi-
cal migration study systems unfortunately not the case,
e.g. for migration of large herbivores or for most bird mi-
grations. However, migration of charr between streams
and fjords in Southern Greenland oers an ideal study
system with replication on individual-, on population
level and on entire ecosystem level. Charr have after
the last glaciation about 10?000 years ago colonized
rivers and lakes and adapted to these habitats over time.
The abundance of unoccupied niches appear to have
caused the spectacular radiations that we have observed
replicated in multiple drainage systems.
The current project focuses on sh migration and ecolog-
ical diversication. Specically, it will investigate how
migratory charr (Salvelinus alpinus) diverge in theirmigratory patterns and ecology in the resident and in
the migratory habitat and additionally how this in turn
aects divergence in the resident habitat. The eldwork
will be carried out in streams, lakes and fjords in South-
ern Greenland and the PhD-student will participate
in two eld expeditions to Southern Greenland of 1-2
months duration.
The position is funded for four years and will be hosted
by the River Fish Ecology group, led by Dr. Jakob
Brodersen (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/-
shec/main-focus/river-sh-ecology/) within the FishEc
Department (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/-
shec/) and the Section of Aquatic Ecology at
University of Bern (http://www.aqua.iee.unibe.ch/).
The work will be carried out in close collaboration
with the research groups of Dr. Blake Matthews,
studying eco-evolutionary dynamics of sticklebacks in
Greenlandic lakes and Dr. Ole Seehausen, studying
biodiversity dynamics. Excellent communication and
writing skills in English and ability to work in a team
are essential.
The PhD-student will be enrolled at the Institute of
Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern and in the
West Swiss graduate school in ecology and evolution.
The work place is at Eawag?s Center for Ecology, Evo-
lution and Biogeochemistry (CEEB) in Kastanienbaum,
Lucerne, which besides the Fish Ecology and Evolution
Department hosts research group from the Department
Surface Waters ? Research & Management and oers

UmeaU ModelingEukaryoteOrigins
\A Ph.D. studentship in mathematics as related to mod-
eling the evolution of endosymbiosis and the evolution-
ary origins of eukaryotes is available in the research
group of Eric Libby at Ume a University in Sweden (
http://ericlibby.github.io/). Candidates should have a
quantitative background with an interest in building
mathematical models of biological systems. The pro-
posed work will feature interdisciplinary projects done
in collaboration with Chris Kempes at the Santa Fe
Institute.
Background for the project: A pivotal event for the
evolution of life on earth was the endosymbiotic event in
which two previously independent cells merged to give
rise to what we now call mitochondria and eukaryotes.
This event is thought to have occurred only once and ac-
count for the evolution of all large, complex life. Despite
its importance, we do not understand the general princi-46 EvolDir May 1, 2019
ples that govern the probability or tness consequences
of an endosymbiotic event. The aim of this Swedish
Research Council-funded PhD position is to address this
signicant knowledge gap by developing a theoretical
framework based on mathematical models that can iden-
tify these principles. Useful modeling techniques include
dierential equations, network approaches, agent-based
simulations, evolutionary analyses, probabilistic models,
and allometric scaling analyses.
Qualications: Candidates need to be skilled in both
oral and written communication in English, and should
be able to work independently as well as in collaboration
with others. Certain coursework is needed in mathe-
matics (contact Eric or see job posting for detailed
information). Candidates need to have prociency, but
not necessarily documented, in working with computers
and programming, e.g. in Matlab, Python, Julia, C++,
or some other language. A good background in mathe-
matics, dierential equations, and/or programming is
qualifying. Interest and knowledge of evolutionary biol-
ogy, microbiology, and/or molecular biology is desirable
but not necessary.

We will select three candidates among all applicants,
and these three will participate in the competition
by GAIA Ecole doctoral school at the University of
Montpellier (https://www.adum.fr/as/ed/page.pl?site=

The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is one of
the most infamous pest insects against crops. This
species was initially observed from North and South
America. In 2016, this species invaded Africa and dev-
astated crop elds. After fall armyworm was found in
Yemen, India, and China and severe deleterious eects
from this species are anticipated. These multiple in-
tercontinental invasions imply a potential risk for this
species to invade Europe. We generated the list of
genes that are adaptively evolved to host-crops from
original American fall armyworms using population ge-
nomics approaches. We also found that copy number
variation is an important source of adaption to local
geographical environment in Latin America. In this
Ph.D., the student will study the path of invasion from
the American continent to the African continent and
potentially associated adaptation processes based on
population genomics approaches. Then, the functional
consequences of this adaptive evolution will be studied
by reciprocal transplantation experiments, which esti-
mate the relative tness of original to alternative hosts
from pre-determined traits of interest.
Supervision: There will be two supervisors; Kiwoong
NAM (INRA) and Thierry Brevault (CIRAD). The the-
sis director is Emmanuelle d'Alencon. Kiwoong NAM
will supervise population genetics analysis, and Thierry
Brevault will supervise eldworks.
Candidates: The student needs to have background on
one or more elds among genetics, population genetics,
molecular evolution, bioinformatics, evolutionary genet-
ics, population genetics, entomology, and ecology. The
candidate does not necessarily have to know how to per-
form computer-programming at the beginning. However,
the candidate should like to work with a computer.
If you wish to apply, please email me a CV, letter of
motivation, and a transcript during the master program.
If the transcript does not indicate your rank (e.g., Xth
among XX students), please provide us a document
showing the rank from your coordinator with the signa-
ture.
Deadline: We accept the application until 29/04.

A PhD student position in molecular evolution is avail-
able at the Department of Ecology and Genetics, Upp-
sala University, Sweden
Supervisors: Dr. Carina Farah Mugal, Prof. Hans El-
legren Title: The role of gene regulatory evolution in
speciation and adaptation of ycatchers
The Department of Ecology and Genetics is an inter-
national environment with sta and students from all
over the world. Our research spans from evolution-
ary ecology and genetics to studies of ecosystems. For
more information, see www.ieg.uu.se . The PhD project
will focus on understanding the molecular basis and
mechanisms of phenotypic variation and dierentiation
between species. Two classical candidates underlying
phenotypic change are protein coding sequences and
functional sequences that regulate gene expression. Here,
changes of the DNA sequence itself or epigenetic mod-
ications can inuence the phenotype. However, the
relative importance of these two sequence classes and
the role of epigenetic modications is still unclear. Fly-
catchers provide a good model system to study this
question. Collared ycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) and
pied ycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) have been a model
of speciation research for decades, and a rich source of ge-
nomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data have become
available. In particular, data on naturally occurring hy-
brids provides the opportunity to study the molecular
basis and mechanisms of reproductive isolation in an
ecologically relevant setting. Moreover, genomic data
of the more distantly related Taiga ycatcher (Ficedula
albicilla) permits studying molecular evolution also at
larger time-scales. The initial work will focus on the
identication and characterization of gene regulatory
elements in the collared ycatcher genome. In addition,
you will establish associations between regulatory ele-
ments and their target genes. This exploration will form
the background for all subsequent analysis. You will
then perform comparative analysis between ycatcher
populations, in the context of speciation research as well
as on larger evolutionary time-scales. The ultimate goal
of the project is to gain a conceptual understanding of
the role of molecular evolution and adaptation at dif-
ferent evolutionary time-scales and levels. This applies
to genetic and epigenetic changes in protein coding se-quences, regulatory elements and transposable elements.
You will acquire cutting-edge skills in bioinformatics
and statistical analysis, which are essential for modern
biology research. In addition, the project will involve
mathematical modelling.
To be eligible for a PhD-student position the applicant
must hold a master degree (or equivalent) in mathemat-
ics, bioinformatics or biology, at the time of appoint-
ment. The applicant with a mathematics background
must have an interest in molecular evolution and pop-
ulation genetics, and a readiness to acquire relevant
skills in bioinformatics. The applicant with a bioinfor-
matics or biology background must have a readiness
to acquire relevant skills in computer science, statistics
and mathematics. Candidates must be able to express
themselves uently in spoken as well as written English.
In addition, the applicant must be able to work inde-
pendently, have good collaborative skills and be able
to communicate (both spoken as well as written). The
applicant must have integrity and personal maturity, be
able take initiative and handle setbacks.
The expected starting date is from October 2019.

VLIZ Belgium 2 MarineBiodiversity
The Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) in Ostend, Bel-

oration with academic research groups, the research
is intended to lead to a PhD at a Flemish University.
Employment can start immediately after the selection

rine viruses play a key role in the functioning of the
global ocean. Viruses are the most abundant biological
entity in the ocean, and harbour the single largest pool
of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth. In addition
to their keyrole in causing illness or even death in a
wide range of marine organisms, viruses also inuence
the evolutionary dynamics and biogeochemical cycles
by infecting and lysing bacteria and protists. There is,
however, still limited knowledge about virus community
structure and the quantitative inuence of viruses on
regional ecosystems.
VLIZ will initiate a research project that investigates the
presence and diversity of marine viruses in the Southern
Bight of the North Sea. Throughout this project, we will
seek to answer some of the following research questions:
1) What is the viral diversity in the Southern North
Sea? 2) What is the natural variability on the abun-
dance and diversity of viruses within this ecosystem? 3)
What are the biotic and abiotic factors that determine
the presence of marine viruses; can we nd causal links
between the diversity of viruses and the diversity of50 EvolDir May 1, 2019
phytoplankton and bacteria? 4) Can we get an idea on
the importance of viruses in the North Sea ecosystem
based on the viral traits (speed of infection, production,
lysis and decay) of the most common viruses from the
Southern North Sea?
This project will be performed in collaboration with one
or more Flemish university research groups and with
the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research.
The project will be largely based on eld samples taken
from the Belgian and Dutch coast. It will focus on
metagenomic analysis of the marine virus community
and virally induced mortality rate measurements of the
marine microbial host community.

research-positions-2019 Project description: Natural
ecosystems are often too complex to study them under
controlled laboratory conditions. Organisms interact
with their environment in multifaceted ways. Our under-
standing of how species traits, species interactions and
evolution of individual species contribute to ecosystem
functions is therefore still very fragmentary. Neverthe-
less, we urgently need better insights in the functioning
of ecosystems to predict how they will change under an-
thropogenic pressures such as global warming or ocean
acidication.
In this research line, VLIZ aims to unravel impor-
tant processes in natural plankton communities such
as ecosystem functions, and mutualist and antagonistic
interactions among dierent species using an ecosys-
tems biology approach. Specically, VLIZ wants to use
high throughput sequencing to describe the composition
(metagenomics) and functions (meta-transcriptomics)
of plankton communities. This information will be used
to model relevant ecosystem processes such as biogeo-
chemical cycling. VLIZ is furthermore interested to
investigate how such processes will alter under various
scenarios of global change.
The study area is primarily the southern North Sea,
where eld surveys can readily be conducted to cover
seasonal and spatial dynamics of plankton communities.Next to the regional focus, we will encourage collab-
oration in international consortia to work on global
datasets. Within this context, VLIZ wants to address
the following research questions: 1) How are plankton
communities composed and which factors dene their
spatial and temporal dynamics? 2) Which key species
and key traits can we identify using gene expression
proles? 3) How can we use meta-transcriptomics data
in ecosystem models (e.g. to investigate biogeochemical
processes)? 4) Can we use these models to predict the
eect of anthropogenic change (e.g. global warming or
ocean acidication)?

The Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA), De-
partment of Clinical Medicine at Faculty of Health at
Aarhus University invites applications for three positions
as Postdoc in the eld of bioinformatics, as per 1 July
2019 or as soon as possible thereafter. The positions
are full-time positions for up to 24-36 months.
The Department of MOMA MOMA (https://moma.dk/-
) oers a vibrant and unique interdisciplinary research
environment with more than 20 years' experience in
genomics, transcriptomics, and translational cancer re-
search. The department houses state-of-the-art lab-

in the recently established Danish National Genome
Center and will house genome sequencing.
About the research group Jakob Skou Pedersen's
research group (https://moma.dk/bioinf-2/pedersen-

The research is primarily based on computational anal-
ysis of local and third-party large cancer genomics data
sets, typically with thousands of samples. Projects mayinclude statistical modelling and methods development.
They may be supplemented by collaborative experimen-
tal hypothesis evaluation. There are close collaborations
with local groups in statistics, bioinformatics, molecular
biology, and clinical oncology as well as numerous inter-
national collaborations, including participation in the
International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and
the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Project

elling to identify and characterise non-coding RNAs and
RNA binding proteins that aect post-transcriptional
regulation in cancer, by correlating gene expression pat-

Context & Objectives:
Assembly of complex, very large, and highly heterozy-
gous genomes remains nowadays a complex task for
which no tool performs well. This is particularly true
for insect genomes, despite countless initiatives such
as i5K. The ITN Ignite aims among other things to
propose new methods for assembling such non-model
invertebrates. New sequencing strategies using both
short (Illumina), long reads (Oxford Nanopore/PacBio),
linked reads (Chromium 10X), as well as approaches
based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) are
be used to alleviate these problems. This project will
aim to develop new algorithms and tools for increasing
the quality and the assembly of large and complex het-
erozygous genomes, while integrating data from diverse
technologies (NGS, long reads, 3C/HiC, 10X), create
new references structure (e.g. haplotypes in genome
graphs) and further applications.
The applicant will be located at the INRIA/IRISA lab-
oratory in the GenScale bioinformatics research team
that focuses on methodological research at the interface
between computer science and genomics. The main ob-
jective of this group is the design of scalable, optimized
and parallel algorithms for processing genomic data gen-
erated by the recent advances of biotechnologies. This
work will be based on the usage and development of
GATB, a C++ library and software suite developed by
the team. And, this project will benet from the INRA
IGEPP laboratory and their collaborators for evaluat-
ing these new strategies on various species with the aim
to infer dierent traits (host recognition, reproduction)
involved in the adaptation of target insect species totheir environment.
Skills
The candidate should have strong algorithmic and C++
development expertise. An important biological back-
ground and motivation is highly recommended.
Working conditions
The recruited engineer will belong to the ETN Ignite
project. Hence she/he will benet from an annual work-
shop, from the whole ETN network and within planned

SouthAfrica ResAssist
BuzzPollination
Volunteer eld assistant: buzz pollination in South
Africa
The Plant Evolution group at the University of Stirling
(UK) is seeking a highly motivated, detail-oriented assis-
tant for eldwork in the Cape mountains (South Africa)64 EvolDir May 1, 2019
during austral Spring 2019 (September/October).
PROJECT: Many plant species use pollen as reward
for pollinators. Some species have evolved a complex
mechanism where pollen is contained within closed (i.e.
poricidal) anthers, and bees need to vibrate the anthers
at particular frequencies for the pollen to be released.
This buzz pollination syndrome has been recorded in
6-8% of all plant species. However, in the hyperdiverse
Cape Floristic Region (CFR), this syndrome is markedly
underrepresented (0.003% of plant species), despite the
presence of some buzz pollinated plants that are endemic
to the CFR. We will be conducting the rst quantitative
study on buzz pollination interactions in the CFR. Par-
ticularly, we will construct plant-pollinator interaction
networks, measure various plant traits, and record the
vibrations of sonicating bees.
LOCATION: Cape Town, South Africa. The eld sites
will mostly be located in the Cederberg mountains and
around Nieuwoudtville. During Spring, these areas are
transformed into carpets of colour when the world's
most predictable mass owering display occurs. Nieu-
woudtville also boasts the highest diversity of geophytes
(including Orchidaceae and Iridaceae) in the world, and
it is an excellent place for botanising, hiking, and bird-
ing. We will be staying in small cabins or camping, and
we will regularly move between eld sites. The work
will involve hiking and long hours in the eld, as well
as processing samples in the evenings.
DUTIES: The successful applicant will be expected to
assist with pollinator observations, trait measurements,
data entry, and collecting owers and pollinators in the
eld.
QUALIFICATIONS: Suitable candidates should be
hardworking, organized, and independent. Experience
in identifying plants and pollinators, recording polli-
nator visitation rates, and experience with eld-based
projects is preferred. Temperatures in this region can
be quite high (30C), and candidates should be prepared
to spend a lot of time in the sun.
WE OFFER food, accommodation and travel within
South Africa. However, we unfortunately cannot oer a
further stipend.
PERIOD: mid-September to mid-October 2019
Please send your questions and applications asap to
Dr Jurene Kemp (jurene.kemp@stir.ac.uk). To apply,
send a cover letter (that includes your background and
interests) and your CV. References will be requested at
a later stage. ?

EvolBiocontrolResistance
Research Laboratory Assistant (Sustainable Insect Con-
trol)
We are seeking a full time Research Assistant to join
a large cross disciplinary research team investigating
host-pathogen interactions to achieve sustainable insect
agricultural pest control. This is a xed term contract
for 20 months. The appointment is expected to be ef-
fective from the 1st June 2019 and a start date in early
June is highly desirable.
As the global human population continues to grow, we
will need to produce 56% more food by 2050 without
using any additional land. This is going to require radi-
cal agricultural innovation, particularly in the area of
crop protection. The availability of eective pest control
strategies has steadily declined due to emerging legisla-
tion protecting human health and the environment, as
well as the mismanagement and widespread overuse of
pesticides leading to the evolution of resistance in many
pest species. As a result, there is an urgent need for
new technologies that minimise damage to our natural
environments while sustainably safeguarding our ability
to protect crops. To address this problem we are ex-
amining how heterogeneous environments produced by
crop and fungal biopesticide combinations can delay or
prevent the evolution of resistance. The appointee will
help manage a large selection experiment manipulating
the infection status and diet of moth larvae of the species
Helicoverpa armigera, and monitor responses to infec-
tion. The work is part of a Newton Funded international
partnership featuring scientists in the UK and Brazil,
and includes a partnership between academic scientists
and the global NGO CAB international. Collaboration
and joint training with other researchers (including 3
UK and 1 Brazilian post-doctoral researchers) will be
encouraged and facilitated. The ability to travel to
Brazil to assist with eldwork is desirable.
The research will be conducted using the Stirling Univer-
sitys state-of-the- art Controlled Environment Facility
and University Gardens. The appointee will be part of
a thriving research environment within Biological and
Environmental Sciences (BES) with more than 40 prin-May 1, 2019 EvolDir 65
cipal investigators, alongside postdoctoral researchers
and 60 PhD students.
Equality and diversity are central to our activities at
the University of Stirling. We believe everyone should
be treated with respect and we deal with people as
equals. We promote equality and celebrate diversity
through a variety of initiatives. The University has
been awarded the Athena SWAN Bronze award, the na-
tional charter for women in science, which recognises and
promotes good practice in advancing women's careers in
STEMM academia (Science, Technology, Engineering,
Mathematics and Medicine). In addition, Biological &
Environmental Sciences holds a departmental Athena
Swan bronze award. Further details can be found here:

We welcome applications from everyone irrespective of
gender and ethnic group, but we especially encourage ap-
plications from women and members of ethnic minority
groups. Appointment will be based on merit alone.
Description of Duties
- Maintenance of insect colonies (as well as related equip-

Wageningen EvolutionaryEcol
The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW)
is a top research institute of the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). NIOO-KNAWconducts fundamental and strategic research on indi-
vidual organisms, populations, communities and ecosys-
tems. Its mission is to carry out excellent research in
ecology. In 2018, NIOO received an 'excellent' rating
in a peer review by an international review committee.
There are four departments, along with seven dynamic
research themes that cut across these departments.
NIOO's department of Animal Ecology is oering a
Tenure-track position for an Evolutionary or Population
Ecologist Vacancy number TT-AnE-019009
Research in the department of Animal Ecology is cen-
tred around the evolutionary and population ecology of
animals, and combines long-term population studies of
birds with experimental work in aviary and water bird
facilities and with the use of avian genomic tools. The
department has an outstanding reputation within the
international scientic community.
Personal prole and requirements - We are looking for
an enthousistic scientist with several years of post- doc-
toral experience, of which at least two years abroad, and
an excellent track record in evolutionary or population
ecology in terms of both publications and the acquisition
of research grants. (S)he is expected to build a strong
research line within the department, to bring in exper-
tise complementary to the other scientists (see https:/-
/nioo.knaw.nl/en/department-animal-ecology) and to
play an active role within the department, the themes
and the institute. - Furthermore, her/his research prefer-
ably makes use of the department's unique triangle of
facilities: long-term populations in the wild, amenities
for studying birds under controlled conditions, and avian
genomics tools. The candidate must have a track record
of acquiring and supervising externally funded PhD stu-
dents. With this appointment, we aim to increase the
gender diversity of senior researchers in the Department,
and therefore we explicitly invite female scientists to ap-
ply. - Scientists at NIOO have no obligation to teach at
university level. However, supervision of external mas-
ter's and PhD students is expected as part of normal
research activity. Scientic communication is carried
out in English, so knowledge of the Dutch language is
not a prerequisite for this position, but a commitment
to learning the language is expected in longer-term sta.
Appointment - In principle, the appointment is for a
tenure-track position: the appointed scientist will be
appointed on a temporary basis for a maximum of 6
years. After 3 and 5 years of employment, there will be
an assessment of performance based on criteria that will
be specied at the time of appointment (for procedures
and general criteria see our Tenure-track Guidelines and
Annex. - Based on these assessments, the researcher
may be promoted to the rank of senior researcher withMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 73

BlueGreatTit
ColourationCollaborativeProject
Dear Blue/Great Tit researchers,
Together with my team, Im running now a project
aimed at studying the physiological and genetic aspects
of feather colouration, using the Blue Tit as a model
species.
One component of this project is a survey of tit coloura-tion spanning the whole European continent, to discover
geographical patterns in tit colouration and pigment
composition. Blue Tit colouration, although serving
as a model for plumage colour evolution, is still poorly
understood, both from the point of view of proximate
mechanisms governing its expression and from the point
of view of genetic mechanisms controlling it. By study-
ing the extent of blue tit feather colouration across the
whole continent we hope to ll one of the gaps in our
knowledge about this trait: namely, how consistent (or
environment-specic) it is.
Our analysis will comprise: 1) colorimetric measure-
ments of sampled feathers (both yellow breast feathers74 EvolDir May 1, 2019
and blue crwon feathers in both sexes); 2) biochemical
analysis of pigments generating the yellow colour us-
ing extraction and HPLC analysis of their content; 3)
electron-microscopy analysis of the nano-structure of
blue feathers.
All described methods have already been used in my
team and very validated in terms of their eciency and
consistency.
The project is focused on Blue Tits. However, since quite
often Blue Tits are studied in parallel with Great Tits,
and there are also many excellent Great Tit-focused
studies across Europe, we do not exclude the possibility
of also including Great Tit yellow feathers in our study,
which would give it an interesting cross-species context.
If you study Blue and/or Great Tits and would like to
contribute to the project - please let me know by lling
in this form:https://forms.gle/sF1HDmcefDy7aihWA.
Once I hear from you, I will contact you with the details
of what is needed in order to take part in the project,
and a detailed protocol of how to proceed with sampling
and what to consider when selecting sampled birds etc.
Briey, I will ask you to provide us with a fresh (i.e.
year 2019 or 2020 if 2019 is o-limits) sample of male
and female feathers (2-3 individuals per study popula-
tion per sex), sampled and secured in a way ensuring
their safe travel and subsequent measurements (we use a
method developed in our projects that makes the whole
process very easy and repeatable). The feathers can
be sent in a regular letter within Europe, which makes
the whole process even easier. Once the feathers get to
us, we will measure their colour using an Ocean Optics
Maya spectrophotometer and extract feather pigments
(yellow feathers only) for subsequent HPLC assay.
Of course, all contributions will be treated equally and
all contributors will be oered co-authorship of all re-
sulting publications.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions or comments.

versity (PL) & School of Biological, Environmental &

Szymek Drobniak JU <szymek.drobniak@uj.edu.pl >Estimating Haplotype Frequencies
As part of a recent project, my collaborators and I de-
rived an expresion for the expected pairwise linkage
disequilibrium under neutral evolution in the absence of
recombination. I would like to compare these predicted
values to actual linkage disequilibria in the genomes of
clonally reproducing organisms or in non-recombinant
regions of the genome in sexually reproducing organisms.
To do so, I need phased haplotype data from a large
number of individuals taken from the same population
- where the genomes of each individual are either se-
quenced/phased separately, or if pooled, the reads are
suciently long to include multiple segregating sites.
The haplotype data would have to come from (mini-
mally) hundreds of individuals, ideally thousands for
allele frequency and LD estimation. The model organ-
ism doesn't matter so much - mt DNA from humans or
other animals, single cell sequence data from tumors,
long-read data from unsegmented viruses, etc.
If anybody can recommend a suitable publically avail-
able source with this type of data, I would appreciate
any suggestions.

lutionary Applications in 2020. Instructions on how
to be considered for this special feature are provided
below. This information is also available at: https://-
urbanevolution-litc.com/evoapp submission/ ***
Urban areas are among the fastest growing ecosystems
on earth and the driver of local and global climate
change. Despite this importance, little is known about
the consequences of urbanization for evolutionary bi-
ology, and its application to human society and envi-
ronmental sustainability. Consequently, the study of
evolution in urban environments is among the fastest
growing research areas in evolutionary biology, with
important implications for fundamental questions in
evolutionary biology and applied problems that relate
to human health, conservation biology, environmental
sustainability, and urban planning. To advance this
research area, Evolutionary Applications will be hosting
a Special Issue examining how urbanization aects the
evolution of organisms living in or near cities, edited
by Marc Johnson, Elizabeth Carlen, Lindsay Miles, and
Kristin Winchell.
To be considered for the special issue, we invite Ab-
stract submissions that propose original theoretical or
empirical research, quantitative reviews/meta-analyses
or perspective articles that oer a novel view on ur-
ban evolution. Contributions from diverse and cross-
disciplinary elds are especially encouraged. We also
encourage submissions from any country and research
discipline. Papers should examine the eects of ur-banization on evolution, or the applied consequences
of urban evolution on urban planning and sustainabil-

PCI Evol Biol is a group of scientists who review and
recommend preprints in evolutionary biology, free of
charge and transparently. It is a research commu-
nity working for researchers to create a new publi-
cation system that is completely free of charge and
independent of private publishers. This community
already includes 400 researchers (the full list can be
found at https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/public/-
recommenders) motivated to review and recommend
preprints.
**Some important points:** -PCI Evol Biol is freefor all users (readers AND authors); -PCI Evol Biol
is supported by scientic societies including the So-
ciety for the Study of Evolution, the Society of
Systematic Biologist, the Nordic Society Oikos, the
French Ecology and Evolution Society (the SFE2),
etc. (https://peercommunityin.org/who-supports-peer-
community-in/); -PCI Evol Biol does not publish the
preprints (they stay on the preprint server) but the
associated reviews and recommendations; -PCI Evol
Biol does not evaluate preprints already submitted for
publication in a journal, in order to avoid parallel re-
viewings; -Authors can submit their preprints to tradi-
tional journals once they have been recommended by
PCI Evol Biol. Reviews obtained before the recommen-
dation can help improve the quality of the preprint;
-Journals such as JEB, Evolution, Ecology Letters, Plos
Biol, TREE, Evolutionary Applications, etc. (https://-
peercommunityin.org/pci-friendly-journals/) indicated
that they will consider the preprints recommended by
PCI Evol Biol and that they will take into account
the reviews and recommendations of PCI Evol Biol in
their own editorial process if adequate. -PCI Evol Biol's
recommendations are transparent (reviews and recom-
mendations are published, recommendations are signed,
reviewers can remain anonymous if they wish); -Only
reviews leading to a recommendation are published; -A
preprint recommended by PCI Evol Biol is scientically
validated and can therefore be cited; -PCI Evol Biol's
recommendations have a DOI, are referenced and can
therefore also be cited; -Four other communities (PCI
Ecology, PCI Paleontology, PCI Animal Science, PCI
Entomology) also exist. -Anonymous submissions are
possible
To submit your preprints, simply go to https:/-

Unitas Malacologica, the world society for mollusc biol-
ogy, is seeking new faces to serve as our elected council
members. Unitas is a global organisation with interna-
tional representation on council; the principle activity
of the organisation is the tri-annual World Congress of
Malacology. You may nominate any suitable person, in-
cluding yourself, for this position (subject to election by
the membership). We need enthusiastic and energetic
people to ll these roles and take UM forward.
There are currently openings for members of council
*and* ocers for three-year terms, terms start after the
2019 General Assembly at the WCM in California.
We need Secretary - responsible for council business,
including annual research awards Treasurer - responsi-

Teaching Evolution Schools
Dear friends,
I am teaching evolution for Biology undergraduate stu-

I am visiting some schools and discussing evolution with
high school students but.... I would like to receive sug-
gestions about games, videos, gures I could use in these
activities.
A new and small Science Museum is starting activities
in our region and I would like to help them to create
a display about biological evolution. My rst idea was
to show the importance of variation and how natural
selection works.
Any ideas, suggestions? Thanks for any help!

UCRiverside NSF REU Livebearing
Fish Placenta Evolution
National Science Foundation Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (NSF REU) Position in Livebearing
Fish Evolution & Reproductive Behavior Research
Overview: A 10-week NSF REU position is available
in David Reznick's lab at the University of Califor-
nia, Riverside for June-August 2019 (June 17 preferred
start date). The REU Student will participate in re-
search on the evolution of placentation in livebearing
shes (poeciliids). Poeciliids have the unique attribute
of having evolved the functional equivalent of a mam-
malian placenta at least nine times. There are at least
three clusters of species that contain close relatives with
and without placentas. This raw material gives us the
opportunity to address questions about why and how
placentas evolved that cannot be addressed in mammals
because all placental mammals trace their common an-
cestry to a single origin of the placenta that happened
100-200 million years ago. We are studying aspects of
reproductive behavior, development, and genomics with
experiments involving crosses between females from dif-
ferent populations of several placental and non-placental
species. These crosses are performed to assay female
and ospring tness based on the genetic distance be-
tween the female and male's populations. Furthermore,
we, in collaboration with another lab, use genetic tech-
niques to determine the paternity of ospring produced
in experimental crosses in which females are articially
inseminated with sperm from multiple males. The goal
is to determine if there is dierential success among
males siring ospring and dierential provisioning of
ospring during development.
Duties: The REU Student will be working with a PhD
student to choose a project and collect/analyze data.
Duties will include helping to maintain experimental
sh (e.g. feeding, water changes and tank cleaning) and
record data throughout the duration of the experiment.Additional duties (i.e. genetics benchwork or specic
experimental methods) will depend on the applicant's
skills and interests.
Eligibility: All animal care and laboratory training will
be provided, and no experience is required. Applicants
should be highly motivated, responsible, and have a
strong desire to learn about and conduct evolutionary
biology research. It is essential that applicants be able
to work in a collaborative environment and be able to
perform occasionally repetitive, meticulous tasks. NSF
requires that applicants be US citizens or permanent
residents of the USA or its possessions. Furthermore,
students must be current undergraduate students en-
rolled through Fall 2019. We especially encourage stu-
dents from under-represented groups and institutions
with relatively limited research opportunities (e.g., com-
munity colleges and undergraduate-only institutions) to
apply.
Travel, Stipend, & Research Expenses: Travel to and
from Riverside, CA will be provided (up to $800) as
well as a stipend of $500/week ( $5000 total) for approx.
40 hours per week. Housing will not be provided.
Application Details: Send a cover letter and CV (see be-
low for contents) in an email with the subject \Reznick
REU Position" to Samantha Levell ( sleve004@ucr.edu)
by April 20th, 2019 at 5pm PST. All applications will
be reviewed after the deadline, and top applicants will
be contacted for Skype interviews shortly after. All
applicants will be notied by May 6th whether they
have received the position or not.
Your cover letter: should be 1-2 pages (single-spaced)
and describe why you want this position and how it ts
into your career goals. Indicate any experience you have
working with sh/live animals. You may also suggest
potential independent research projects, which we may
be able to accommodate during the REU period.
Your CV must include: relevant coursework and cur-
rent GPA, any work/volunteer/research positions held,
current/past research project descriptions or publica-
tions, awards/honors, and contact information for three
references.
The Reznick lab strives to maintain a positive environ-
ment for all its members. All qualied applicants will
receive consideration for this position without regard to
race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity, national origin, age, disability, protected veteran
status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

About the research group Jakob Skou Pedersen's
research group (https://moma.dk/bioinf-2/pedersen-
group) studies cancer evolution and gene regulation.
The research is primarily based on computational anal-
ysis of local and third-party large cancer genomics data
sets, typically with thousands of samples. Projects may
include statistical modelling and methods development.
They may be supplemented by collaborative experimen-
tal hypothesis evaluation. There are close collaborations
with local groups in statistics, bioinformatics, molecular
biology, and clinical oncology as well as numerous inter-
national collaborations, including participation in the
International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and

carried out.
Your job responsitibilities As a Postdoc in bioinfor-
matics, your position is primarily research-based. You
will contribute to the development of the department
through research of high international quality. In your
daily work, you will work closely with colleagues on
your project, where you will receive supervision and
guidance.
You will be joining one of the following research projects:
A) Cancer evolution (1-2 positions): Explore the mu-
tational processes underlying cancer development and
progression. A key question will be how repair decien-
cies shape mutational patterns. The analysis will involve
thousands of whole cancer genomes and rely on integra-
tion of somatic mutations at both the single nucleotide
and structural level, germline variants, expression data,
epigenetic data, layers of genomics annotation, etc. De-
pending on your background, the analysis may rely on
existing tools and methods or involve statistical mod-
elling and method development. Concrete hypotheses
may be sought validated in local patient cohorts or in
wet-lab experiments through ongoing local collabora-
tions.
B) Gene regulation and non-coding RNAs (1-2 posi-
tions): Explore tens of thousands of gene expression
data sets to learn about non-coding RNAs and post-
transcriptional regulation in cancer. One of your pos-
sible aims is to characterise intronic RNAs in cancer
from large local and third-party total RNAseq data
sets. Another possible aim is to use statistical mod-
elling to identify and characterise non-coding RNAs and
RNA binding proteins that aect post-transcriptional
regulation in cancer, by correlating gene expression pat-
terns with presence of binding sites across large sample
cohorts. Functional hypotheses may be sought experi-mentally evaluated through local collaborations.
You must indicate which positions you would like to be
considered for.
Your competences You have academic qualications
at PhD level, preferably within bioinformatics, statis-

MicrobesSocialParasiteBeetles
Postdoctoral position in microbial interactions between
ants and social parasite beetles (Parker Lab)
Research focus: A postdoctoral position is available to
study the impact of endosymbiont microbes on animal-
animal symbiotic relationships in the lab of Joe Parker
at the California Institute of Technology.
Work in the Parker lab is focused on social and symbiotic
relationships between animals. We use a unique system
to explore these phenomena: the convergent evolution
of social parasitism of ant colonies by rove beetles (fam-
ily Staphylinidae). Rove beetles comprise the largest
metazoan family (64,000 species), and include multi-
ple lineages that have evolved to inltrate ant societies,
employing behavioral, anatomical and chemical adap-
tations. The Parker lab studies these adaptations at
the molecular and neurobiological levels. We are now
seeking a postdoctoral researcher to probe the endosym-
biotic microbiota of rove beetles and their host ants, to
address how communities of microbes and multicellular
organisms inuence each others evolution and function.
The successful candidate will spearhead community
metabarcoding and metagenomics of ants and social
parasite rove beetles to uncover microbial interactions
within and between these animal species. The focal
system is a model ant-beetle symbiosis that has evolved
in the South Western US, in which multiple rove beetle
lineages have convergently evolved to inltrate colonies
of a single ant genus. This project involves eldwork
at local sites near Caltech, as well as in Southern Ari-
zona. To better understand how microbes inuence
social and symbiotic interactions between these species,
experimental laboratory manipulations of beetle and
ant microbiomes will be pursued, together with pheno-
typic analysis of behavior and chemical ecology. Infer-
ences about how the evolution of animal interactions
impacts the microbiome will be pursued by compara-
tive studies of the microbiota of parasitic and related,
free-living beetles. There is substantial opportunity to
collaborate with other microbiology labs at both Cal-
tech and the University of Southern California, as well
as collaboration with theoretical biologists to develop
empirically-based models of multilevel, microbe-animal
networks.

*Postdoc position on speciation history in nightingales*
*Available from June 2019 to December 2021 (the start-
ing date is exible) Evaluation of applications starts on
1st of May 2019 and will continue until the position is
lled.*
*Project description:* Patterns of genetic variation
within and between species enable to make inferences
about demographic history of species, levels of post-
divergence gene ow as well as evolutionary forces act-
ing on specic genes. Such information can provide a
valuable insight into the history and mechanisms of spe-
ciation. This project aims at understanding the complex
history of speciation in two closely related passerines,
the Common Nightingale and the Thrush Nightingale,
that hybridize in a zone of secondary contact. The suc-
cessful candidate will use the whole-genome sequences
from multiple individuals of both nightingale species
from sympatric as well as allopatric populations. These
data will be used to (1) model the demographic history
of species divergence, (2) explore the genomic landscape
of interspecic dierentiation and divergence and iden-
tify specic genomic regions with reduced introgression
between species that underlie reproductive isolation, (4)
identify specic genes with signs of adaptive introgres-
sion, and (3) seek for signatures of selection on sympatric
populations, which might unravel mechanisms of rein-
forcement and/or ecological character displacement atthe genetic level. The results will provide a unique in-
sight into the mechanisms or species origin as well as
the role of genetic introgression in adaptive evolution.
*Candidate experience:* The successful candidate will
be mainly responsible for the bioinformatic part of the
project. The position requires experience in analysis of
large-scale next-generation sequence data and the ideal
candidate should have background in population genet-
ics. Programming skills are desirable. Experience in the
wet lab is a plus, but is not necessary. The candidate
may be involved in the eldwork if he/she wishes.
*Research group:* The selected candidate will work in
a young independent research group of population and
speciation genetics. The group is based at the Depart-
ment of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles University,
which belongs to the leading research institutions in the
Czech Republic. The Faculty of Science is situated in
the center of Prague, one of the world's most beautiful
and monumental cities. Please see the web pages of
the group for more details (http://web.natur.cuni.cz/-

*How to apply:* If interested, please, send (1) CV in-
cluding a list of publications, (2) copy of PhD diploma,
(3) motivation letter, and (3) contact details for 2'3 ref-
erences to Radka Reifova ( radka.reifova@natur.cuni.cz).

ClemsonU DrosophilaGenetics
The laboratories of Trudy Mackay and Robert Anholt at
the Clemson University Center for Human Genetics in-
vite applications for a postdoctoral fellow to support an
NIH grant, Genetics of Cocaine and Methamphetamine
Sensitivity in Drosophila. The Center is housed in Self
Regional Hall on the campus of the Greenwood Ge-
netic Center and provides state-of-the-art facilities for
genomic and systems genetic research.
Illegal use of psychostimulants, such as cocaine and
methamphetamine, presents a worldwide health problem.
Illicit drug use alone accounts for $181 billion in health
care, productivity loss, crime, incarceration, and drug
enforcement. However, little information is available
regarding genetic susceptibility to the eects of these
drugs in human populations. Drosophila melanogaster
presents a powerful model system to study the genetic
underpinnings of drug susceptibility, since both the ge-
netic background and environment, including exposure
to drugs, can be controlled precisely. Many eects of
psychostimulants on people are replicated in ies, in-
cluding suppression of sleep, arousal, suppression of
food intake, and locomotor eects; and 70% of y genes
have human orthologs. The successful candidate will
assess the role of variation in brain morphology on na ve
and experience-dependent drug consumption, and per-
form bulk and single cell RNA and ATAC sequencing
of Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel lines that are
genetically divergent for drug consumption behaviors.
Applicants with expertise in any aspect of genet-
ics/genomics, including molecular, developmental, be-
havioral, quantitative or statistical genetics, and apti-
tude for analyses of large data sets are encouraged to
apply. Salaries are commensurate with NIH postdoc-
toral pay scale and postdoctoral fellows will receive an
annual $15,000 discretionary research supplement along
with ample opportunities to travel to conferences both
nationally and internationally.

2019, have strong skills in molecular ecology (metabar-
coding and bioinformatics experience is especially rele-
vant), an interest in sheries, and a strong publication
record commensurate with career stage. We expect the
postdoc to help design and then execute genetic analyses
in the lab, and to lead bioinformatic data processing
and biogeographic inferences based on metabarcoding
results, sh distribution patterns, and sheries landing
data. Equally important, the postdoc will be encour-
aged to serve as an intellectual co-leader of the project,
and assist with seeking further funding. This project is
a collaborative eort, and will require a team-oriented
approach as the postdoc works with both Cornell PIs,
EDF sta, and another postdoc studying mercury con-
tamination in aquaculture feeds.

work on the recently funded 'Antimicrobial Resistance:
Emergence, Transmission, and Ecology (ARETE)'
project (project page: http://arete-amr.ca). The over-
arching goal of the project is to perform analysis of
thousands of microbial genomes to identify risk fac-
tors for lateral gene transfer (LGT) of antimicrobial-
resistance determinants, and map transmission between
habitats using phylogenetic and related methods. The
Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD;
https://card.mcmaster.ca/) will serve as the reference
database for the projects. ARETE is a partnership
between several academic institutions, as well as the
Public Health Agency of Canada and Agriculture and
Agri-Food Canada, and is part of the larger IRIDA
initiative (https://www.irida.ca/).
Postdoctoral Fellow #1 (position ID 2019-06) will build
on existing tools (see for example http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/-
Software/RSPR) to infer phylogenetic trees and perform
large-scale inference of LGT. Key challenges include ro-
bust, large-scale phylogenomic inference, and synthesiz-
ing dierent lines of evidence to build a comprehensive
picture of gene transfer in large genomic datasets. This
position requires someone with a background in either
bioinformatics or computer science. Key technical skills
include: Phylogenetics Microbial genomics and evolu-
tion Some programming (Python sucient; C++ an
asset)
Postdoctoral Fellow #2 (position ID 2019-07) will de-
velop methods to map inferred LGT events into an
ecological context. This will include the association ofMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 89
events with specic habitat parameters (e.g., geographic
location, habitat type, specic patterns of antibiotic
usage), as well as 'gene-ecology' methods that exam-
ine the distributional dynamics of microbial genes and
map these into traditional ecological frameworks (see for
example https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/38/-
1/90/510792). This position requires an individual with
a background in bioinformatics and/or ecology. Key
technical skills include: Microbial ecology Community
ecology / metacommunity theory Analysis in R/Python
Additionally, we are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to
extend existing work in the inference of antimicrobial-
resistance genes from metagenomic data. This work
extends the current AMRtime project ( https://-
github.com/beiko-lab/AMRtime), which uses rapid ho-
mology ltering and search alongside machine-learning
methods to assign metagenomic sequences to specic
classes of AMR genes. Postdoctoral Fellow #3 (position
ID 2019-08) will augment AMRtime with new models
to better detect novel AMR variants that fall outside
currently dened strict criteria for detection. Extending
these models will require a combination of methods that
encompass taxonomic assignment, sensitive homology
search, mobile-element detection, and phylogenetics to
dierentiate legitimate AMR matches from homologs
that do not confer a resistance phenotype. All postdoc-
toral fellows will collaborate with other members of the
project team, and be expected to give conference presen-
tations and prepare journal articles based on their work.
There will be opportunities to gain project-management
experience through the ARETE project.
Please send a CV and statement of research
interests to Elvira Mitraka, project manager
(elvira.mitraka@gmail.com). Applicants should
indicate the position ID in the email subject header.
Review of applications will begin on April 20, 2019.
To receive full consideration, please submit your

applications is 19.05.2019.
Job description A position as Postdoctoral Research
Fellow in Evolutionary Biology/Ornithology is available
at the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo. The
position is placed in the ?Sex and Evolution Research
Group? (SERG). The appointment is a fulltime posi-
tion and is made for a period of four years with 25 %
duty work devoted to teaching, supervision, collection
management (curatorial work in the ornithological col-
lection of NHM), outreach activities and administration.
The postdoctoral fellow is expected to acquire basic
pedagogical competency in the course of the fellowship
period within the duty component of 25 %. The main
purpose of the fellowship is to qualify researchers for
work in higher academic positions within their disci-
plines.Starting date no later than 01.10.2019.More about the position The position is placed in the
Sex and Evolution Research Group (SERG). The re-
search group currently consists of two professors, two
researchers and two PhD-students, as well as master
students. The research themes are concentrated on
the importance of sex, sex roles and sexual conict
in shaping evolutionary processes such as speciation,
hybridization, diversication and adaptation. These
processes are studied at dierent levels of organization,
like genes, genomes, gametes, individuals, populations
and species. Most projects use birds as their study sys-
tems. The research group has access to large museum
collections in ornithology, including a unique collection
of formalin-preserved sperm cells from more than 500
species, and a DNA bank with more than 50 000 bird
tissue samples. Field work for comparative studies is
often carried out abroad and in collaboration with other
institutions and research groups.
We invite a highly motivated researcher to work on
and develop a project entitled ?Macroevolution of avian
spermatozoa? in close collaboration with the scientic
sta in the SERG group. The project will consist of
three main parts, (1) a descriptive analysis of the ma-
jor patterns of sperm phenotype dierentiation across
the passerine phylogeny, (2) analyses of evolutionary
rates of sperm variation among and within lineages, and
(3) investigation of the genomic mechanisms underlying
sperm trait evolution. The approach will be largely phy-
logenetically controlled comparative analyses combined
with in-depth phylogenomics of selected taxa. There
will also be a need for additional eld work to sample
important taxa currently lacking in our sperm database.
Qualication requirements The candidate must have a
PhD in ecology, evolution or avian systematics. We seek
a highly competent and motivated early career evolution-
ary biologist, with skills in comparative analyses and evo-
lutionary modelling and experience with bioinformatic
tools for handling large genomic data sets. Experience
with ornithological eld work and good knowledge in
bird systematics is required, while experience with work
on spermatozoa, including microscopy and morphome-
try, and other natural history collection work, will be
considered advantageous. A good command of written
and spoken English is required.

vated, creative scientist to join the Tinghitella research
group at the University of Denver to study the evolution
of sexual signaling systems and the evolutionary genetics
of diversication. Salary and benets are competitive.
Position summary: Primary duties will include conduct-
ing research on rapid evolutionary change in the sexual
signals of Hawaiian eld crickets, their genetic/genomic
underpinnings, and implications for reproductive iso-
lation. The project capitalizes on an unprecedented
opportunity to observe the emergence of what may be
a new sexual signal, track its coevolution (or not) with
the preferences and sensory systems of intended and
unintended receivers (females and natural enemies), and
examine the signals evolutionary origin and genomic ar-
chitecture. The postdoc will be responsible for carrying102 EvolDir May 1, 2019
out research projects in the laboratory and eld, train-
ing and supervising other personnel, analyzing data,
and publishing results in a timely fashion. There will be
ample opportunities to also participate in a new science
communication program explicitly aimed at broadening
participation in the sciences.
Diversication and even speciation are believed to be
tied to the evolution of novel communication systems.
There is a growing appreciation for the role of sexual
selection in speciation processes, but comparisons are
necessarily made between closely related species or pop-
ulations that have diered in sexual signals for many,
many generations. Less than two years ago we dis-
covered a population of crickets that produce songs
(purring) with properties that dier dramatically from
the ancestral type (typical). Purring crickets are now
found in several long-studied locations where they were
not previously, aording us an opportunity to observe
the origin and subsequent evolution of a novel song and
its potential consequences for sexual isolation in real
time.
Minimum qualications: Experience generating and an-
alyzing phenotypic (morphology, behavior) and tness
data; knowledge of quantitative and/or evolutionary ge-
netics; experience and willingness to do longer-term eld
work; excellent analytical skills; demonstrated ability
to publish good quality papers; strong communication
and writing skills. Ph.D. required in a related eld of
biology.
Desired qualications: Experience in population ge-
nomics and/or analysis of auditory signals desired. The
position provides additional opportunities for indepen-
dent research in related areas for motivated postdoctoral
scientists.
The academic environment: The University of Denver
has a growing group of faculty, students, and post-
docs studying Ecology and Evolution (see https://-
dueeb.weebly.com). The EEB program is a dynamic
and highly interactive group. The postdoc will work
closely with collaborators Erica Larson (University of
Denver) and Dale Broder (St. Ambrose University) who
have expertise in genomics and evolutionary ecology.
Denver and the Front Range: Denver is an awesome
western city of ~700,000 people with a vibrant art com-

A 3-year postdoctoral research position is available to
work on a newly-funded ERC project in the lab of Laura
Ross (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of
Edinburgh, UK) entitled 'How to break Mendel's laws?
The role of sexual conict in the evolution of unusual
transmission genetics'. We are looking for an enthu-
siastic and motivated postdoc interested in evolution-
ary/molecular genetics, epigenetics and reproductive
biology.
The project focuses on the evolution and mechanism of
Paternal Genome Elimination, a type of reproduction
found across thousands of insects where males lose their
father's genome during spermatogenesis and only trans-
mit maternally-derived chromosomes to their ospring.
We will use genomic, cytogenetic and experimental ap-
proaches in mealybugs to understand how chromosomes
from the mother and father are recognized within sons,
how this aects the expression of maternal and pater-
nal alleles (\genomic imprinting"), how the paternal
genome is eliminated and how this elimination aects
ospring sex. The project will be carried out in close
collaboration with several Project Partners in the UK
and abroad.
Within the project, the postdoc will be able to develop
independent lines of research with a view to establishingMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 103
themselves as an independent investigator. The project
includes substantial funds for sequencing, consumables,
computing, training, and to attend international confer-
ences. The position is initially funded for 3 years with
an approximate start date of June 1st 2019.
Applicants should have a strong background in evolu-
tionary genetics/molecular biology and a PhD (or soon
to be obtained) in a relevant subject area (genetics,
evolutionary biology, molecular biology, cell biology).
Experience working with genomic data, molecular biol-
ogy wet lab and bioinformatics skills are essential, as is a
strong track record of independent and creative thinking.
Applicants should be be willing to take on the challenges
of working with a non-model organism. Experience with
insect model systems, bisulte and ChIP-seq sequencing
data, RNAi experiments, FISH/in situ hybridization
would be very advantageous.

UEdinburgh EvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Genetics
A postdoctoral position is available to join the group
of Peter Keightley to work on the evolutionary impact
of spontaneous mutations. As the ultimate source of
genetic variation, new mutations play a central role in
evolutionary biology. The rate of spontaneous mutation
and the genetic basis of variation from mutations are
key to many unresolved questions, including the fate
of small populations, the evolution of ageing and the
genetic basis of quantitative trait variation.
We aim to study two unique resources developed in our
lab, in which mutations are expected to accumulate at
radically dierent rates. The rst is a highly replicated
set of spontaneous mutation accumulation (MA) lines in
mice, the rst such set of lines in any mammalian species.
Each MA line is bred for many generations in the near-
absence of natural selection, leading to molecular and
phenotypic divergence among lines. The second is a set
of replicated MA lines (maintained for ~1,000 genera-
tions) in dierent strains and species of the single-celled
green alga Chlamydomonas. We will address questions
concerning the nature of the new mutational variation
aecting the genome, gene expression and quantitative
traits.104 EvolDir May 1, 2019
Applicants should have or shortly obtain a PhD in a rele-
vant subject, e.g., evolutionary genetics or genomics. Ex-
perience in bioinformatics will be an advantage. Candi-
dates should have an outstanding academic track record
commensurate with their career stage and experience.
She/he is expected to be active in developing the project
and to contribute to an enthusiastic working atmosphere.
Candidates will benet from training in a vibrant in-
tellectual and collaborative environment in the UK's
largest evolutionary biology institute. The project is
funded by an ERC Advanced Grant to Peter Keight-
ley and Diethard Tautz (MPI Ploen, Germany) and
has substantial funds for computing, sequencing and
travel. The position is available immediately until 31st
December 2021.

http://entnemdept.ifas.u.edu/people-directory/daniel-
hahn/ Background for the project:
Animals and plants must synchronize their life-history
timing to exploit good times and avoid bad times of the
year. Synchronization among interacting species makes
seasonal responses a critical organizational component
of ecological communities. Adaptation in seasonal tim-
ing can create and maintain biodiversity. Reproduc-
tion is often seasonal. Therefore, shifts in seasonal
timing can disrupt reproductive timing among popu-
lations, catalyzing speciation. Moreover, formation of
new taxa creates opportunities for other, interacting
organisms to diversify in kind. Shifts in seasonal timing
can have reverberating eects generating new biodiver-
sity through ecosystems. Contemporary climate change
is driving changes in seasonality. The capacity of eco-
logical communities to evolve in concert with changing
conditions will impact whether interactions among com-
munity members will be maintained or disrupted under
new climatic regimes.May 1, 2019 EvolDir 105
Our broader collaborative research team, including Je
Feder at Notre Dame, Greg Ragland at University of
Colorado-Denver, Tom Powell at Binghamton Univer-
sity New York, and Dan Hahn at University of Florida
is investigating the role of seasonal adaptation in the
origin and maintenance of insect biodiversity. Rhago-
letis pomonella, the apple maggot y, is a fruit-feeding
agricultural pest that has recently evolved (since the
mid 1880s). Seasonality drives diversication; apple
ies evolved an earlier life cycle than their hawthorn-
feeing ancestors to feed on earlier ripening apple fruits.
Superimposed on seasonal partitioning of plant-feeding
ies are additional radiations involving parasitic wasps.
Three wasps have similarly diverged in life cycle timing
to match the seasonal shift of their R. pomonella hosts
to earlier fruiting apples.
This multidisciplinary project will test whether the same
physiological, molecular, and genomic mechanisms un-
derlying the shift in life history timing allowing Rhago-
letis to attack apples are also involved in sequential
shifts and seasonal adaptation of the parasitic wasps
attacking apple ies.

UMichigan AdaptiveLimits
A working group (Brian Weeks, Benjamin Winger, and
Kathleen Bergen) at the newly-formed Institute for
Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan is
hiring a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. The Fellow will
work on predicting the limits to adaptive shifts in range
and migration phenology in migratory birds, with a focusMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 109
on the interaction of these phenomena with concomitant
changes in morphology and allometry. While past ef-
forts to predict shifts in species ranges and phenologies
have focused largely on projecting changes in climatic
niche envelopes, the extreme physiological demands of
migration may impose constraints on these adaptive
strategies in migratory species. In particular, the obser-
vation that many migratory birds are getting smaller as
temperatures increase (see: https://www.biorxiv.org/-
content/10.1101/610329v1), suggests that morphologi-
cal adaptation may be a key dimension of climate change
adaptation. Understanding how morphological change
may facilitate or inhibit adaptive shifts in range and phe-
nology through changes in optimal migratory dynamics
as well as relationships to landscape/habitat change is
the goal of this position.
The position will begin Fall 2019, is based at the School
for Environment and Sustainability at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor, is for 2 years, and comes with
a competitive salary and benets. The postdoc will be

SpeciationTheoryGenomics
Postdoctoral Positions at the University of Minnesota,
Twin Cities
We are seeking postdocs to work on an NSF-funded
project on the contribution of mating system evolution
to speciation. The initial hire will focus on both theoret-
ical questions in the evolution of character displacement,
speciation genetics, and mating system, and the genera-
tion and analysis of complementary population genomic
data.
The project is a collaboration among three labs at
the U. of Minnesota: Yaniv Brandvain (brandvain-
lab.wordpress.com), Emma Goldberg (umn.edu/ ~eeg),
and David Moeller (moellerlab.wordpress.com). The
project integrates eld experiments, population ge-
nomics, and mathematical modeling to investigate the
evolution of character displacement and reinforcement
between incipient species of Clarkia xantiana, an annual
plant with a long history of research in evolutionary
biology.
Some of the major goals of the project are to (1) ex-
amine the role of natural selection in the evolution of
reproductive character displacement using a combina-
tion of mathematical models and eld experiments, (2)
quantify the ecological and genetic costs of hybrid for-
mation using eld experiments and genomic analysis,
and (3) assess the consequences of pre- and post-zygotic
isolating mechanisms for genome-wide patterns of in-

mation about the School may be accessed: http://-
www.biology.uq.edu.au/ . THE POSITION
The Chenoweth research group has a number of projects
underway that aim to understand how gene expression
evolves in species with two sexes. Our projects combine
evolutionary quantitative genetic theory with genomic
experiments conducted in fruit ies. Ongoing stud-
ies include 1) understanding the contributions of cis-
and trans-regulatory mutations to adaptation of the two
sexes, 2) developing new population genomic approaches
for detecting natural selection - a collaboration with the-
oretical population geneticist Tim Connallon at Monash
University, and 3) understanding how pleiotropy shapes
the evolution of high-dimensional regulatory phenotypes.
These projects are supported through quantitative ge-
netic studies of natural variation in allele specic expres-
sion (ASE) in Drosophila serrata, an endemic found in
rainforests along the east coast of Australia. Our group
has recently performed extensive RNA-Seq assays of
regulatory variation in F1 crosses created from panels of
resequenced lines sourced from both natural populations
and a mutation accumulation experiment.

BacterialEvolutionaryGenomics
*Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Genomics of
Host-Pathogen Interactions*
A postdoctoral position for a computational biologist is
available to study how bacterial pathogens evolve in the
lungs of cystic brosis patients over the course of disease
development and treatment. The project is in the labo-
ratory of David S. Guttman in the Department of Cell &
Systems Biology at the University of Toronto, Canada..
The specic project employs genomic data from >2000
longitudinal-collected strains of Pseudomonas aerug-
inosa to understand evolutionary dynamics, identify
causative mutations, and predict antimicrobial suscep-
tibility. The candidate will focus on computational
analyses using evolutionary and comparative genomic,
genome-wide association, and machine learning methods.
There is also potential for metagenomic and microbiome
investigation depending on the candidate's interests.
The position is part of a multi-institution Collaborative
Health Research Project funded by the Canadian Insti-
tutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and
Engineering Research Council of Canada.Interested applicants should have a Ph.D. (or be very
close to completion) in population, evolutionary, or sta-
tistical genetics or genomics. A strong background is
evolutionary biology, mathematics and / or statistics
is preferred. Some computational experience is neces-
sary. The positions is available for a minimum of two
years, subject to annual review, and can be started
immediately.
The Guttman lab is a highly energetic and diverse group
broadly focused on bacterial evolution in the context of
host-microbe interactions. The lab aims to understand
how bacterial pathogens adapt to changes in disease
state or treatment over very short time scales in the
CF lung; the evolution of host specicity and virulence
and the emergence of new pathogens using the plant
pathogen Pseudomonas syringae; and the role of mi-
crobial communities (microbiomes) in both human and
plant health and disease. The Guttman lab is also
closely associated with the Centre for the Analysis of
Genome Evolution & Function (CAGEF), which is a
genome centre with particular expertise in microbial
and plant genomics and metagenomics. The genomic
and bioinformatic resources aorded by CAGEF make
the Guttman lab a particularly good place to work.
To apply, please send: 1) a cover letter outlining
your research interests, career goals, and previous
experience; 2) a CV; and 3) contact information

PopulationGenomics
[Note - reposted due to formatting issues with a previous
version, with new due date of May 15]
The research group of John Pool at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison invites applications for a postdoc-
toral research position. There are multiple opportunities
for projects to work on, with an overarching theme of
addressing big questions in population/evolutionary ge-
netics. I'd like to give the successful candidate for this
position a strong voice in shaping their research direction
in the lab.
Potential research areas could include:
* The Genetic Architecture of Adaptive Evolution When
traits evolve in nature, we'd like to understand how many
genes are involved, whether selection acts on stand-
ing variation or new mutations, whether it ultimately
xes the causative variants, and how predictable these
changes are across populations evolving in parallel. We
are also looking at the roles of epistasis and cryptic
variation in the adaptive process. We focus on local
adaptation among Drosophila melanogaster populations
from contrasting natural environments, which provides
a powerful and ecient system for addressing these
questions.
* The Genetic Architecture of Reproductive Isolation
Perhaps surprisingly, both viability and reproductive
incompatibilities exist between African and European
populations of D. melanogaster, which diverged only ~10
kya but now occupy very dierent environments. We
are developing this largely untapped system as a prime
model for the evolution of reproductive isolation, with
an interest in both mapping specic incompatibilities
and estimating genome-wide parameters relevant to this
partial isolation.
* Fundamental Population Genetics We are interested
in leveraging big data (such the >1000 genomes from
our Drosophila Genome Nexus) to ask basic popula-
tion genetic questions. Examples could include new
angles on the classic but unresolved controversy over
the relative roles of selective sweeps and background
selection, the relative occurrence of hard and soft sweepson autosomes versus the X chromosome, and estimating
the total number of adaptive dierences between two
populations.
Our research group was founded 7 years ago and cur-
rently includes 1 postdoc and 5 PhD students. I have
advised 4 former postdocs, and the publication records
of Amir Yassin and Justin Lack show what a productive
environment our lab can be. I also welcome postdocs
taking important components of our research with them
when they found their own labs. Further lab info: http:/-

The Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) in Ostend, Bel-
gium has a vacancy for a researcher. Employment can
start immediately after the selection procedure and
ideally not later than 1st of October 2019. Deadline
for applications is 15th of May. Read full job posting
here: http://www.vliz.be/en/vacancy/14-new-research-
positions-2019 Project description: Natural ecosystems
are often too complex to study them under controlled
laboratory conditions. Organisms interact with their
environment in multifaceted ways. Our understanding
of how species traits, species interactions and evolu-tion of individual species contribute to ecosystem func-
tions is therefore still very fragmentary. Nevertheless,
we urgently need better insights in the functioning of
ecosystems to predict how they will change under an-
thropogenic pressures such as global warming or ocean
acidication.
In this research line, VLIZ aims to unravel impor-
tant processes in natural plankton communities such
as ecosystem functions, and mutualist and antagonistic
interactions among dierent species using an ecosys-
tems biology approach. Specically, VLIZ wants to use
high throughput sequencing to describe the composition
(metagenomics) and functions (meta-transcriptomics)
of plankton communities. This information will be used
to model relevant ecosystem processes such as biogeo-
chemical cycling. VLIZ is furthermore interested to
investigate how such processes will alter under various
scenarios of global change.
The study area is primarily the southern North Sea,
where eld surveys can readily be conducted to cover
seasonal and spatial dynamics of plankton communities.
Next to the regional focus, we will encourage collab-
oration in international consortia to work on global
datasets. Within this context, VLIZ wants to address
the following research questions: 1) How are plankton
communities composed and which factors dene their
spatial and temporal dynamics? 2) Which key species
and key traits can we identify using gene expression
proles? 3) How can we use meta-transcriptomics data
in ecosystem models (e.g. to investigate biogeochemical
processes)? 4) Can we use these models to predict the
eect of anthropogenic change (e.g. global warming or
ocean acidication)?
This project will be organised in collaboration with one
or more Flemish university research groups. There will
be a focus on high throughput sequencing and bioinfor-
matics analysis. Mathematical modelling in a systems
biology context will form another core of this research
project. This research will be performed in close collab-
oration with a post-doctoral researcher working on the
same research line.

IntroductionToGWAS,Nov25-29
Dear colleagues,
Transmitting Science is oering a new course:
Introduction to GWAS (Genome-Wide Association
Studies), November 25th-29th, 2019, Barcelona
(Spain).Instructor: Gerard Muntan&#233; (Universitat
Rovira i Virgili, Spain).
Course overview:
Genome-wide association studies have become increas-
ingly popular to identify associations between genetic
risk factors and phenotypic traits.
This introductory course is addressed to medical stu-
dents, social scientists, and biologists without formal
training in the eld. The aim of the course is to provide
a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. In addition
to the illustration of the standard GWAS process, we
will also show how to perform functional enrichment
and apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis in order
to provide individual level scores of genetic risk.
A mix of theoretical background and hands on expe-rience will walk students through a series of increas-
ingly complex data manipulation and visualization tasks.
These exercises will be based on PLINK, PRSice, and R,
among others, which are commonly used, freely available
software tools that are accessible for novice users.

biologists dealing with the analysis of multiple molec-
ular sequences at several levels: Populations, species,
clades, communities. These biologists address questions
relative to the evolutionary relationships among these
sequences, as well as the evolutionary forces structuring
biodiversity at dierent scales. The objectives are: (i)
to learn the theoretical bases phylogenetic analysis, (ii)
to know how to choose a strategy of molecular data
analysis at the inter or intraspecic levels, (iii) to be
able to initiate a phylogenetic analysis starting from
the les of molecular sequences until the interpretation
of the results and the graphics. The software used
for this course will be centered on the R language
for statistics. This will include the use of specialized
packages particularly ape, phangorn, and adegenet.

Course: Big data Biogeography V Species occurrences
through space and time
When: 4-8 November 2019
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany)
Summary: The public availability of large-scale species
distribution data has increased drastically over the last
ten years. In particular, due to the aggregation of
records from museums and herbaria, and citizen science
in public databases such as the Global Biodiversity Infor-
mation Facility (GBIF). This is leading to a ¥big data
revolution in biogeography, which holds an enormous
but still poorly explored potential for understanding
large scale patterns and drivers of biodiversity in space
and time.
Objectives: After this course, students will be able to:
Obtain and prepare large scale species occurrence
records from public databases in R (including data min-
ing, data cleaning and exploration) Apply novel methods
for handling and processing ¥big data in biogeographic
research, including area classication, bioregionalization
and automated conservation assessments
Reconstruct species ancestral ranges based on species
occurrences and phylogenetic trees, using dierent evo-
lutionary models Understand the potential and caveats
of fossil based biogeography, and be familiar with novel
methods to estimate ancestral ranges and evolutionary
rates from ranges of extinct and extant taxa

BioinformaticsWithBashAndPython
Oct14-18
Course: Bioinformatics with Bash and Python
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany)
When: 14-18 October 2019
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
biologists)
Overview:
A fundamental part of bioinformatics (in contrast to
simply computational biology) is the idea of scaling
and automation. We want to arrange our tools into
pipelines which can be executed with minimal supervi-
sion. Reliable automation of this type is key to many of
the things that we want from our analyses; chiey the
ability to reproduce our results, and to extend them to
other datasets.
In this course we will examine two dierent systems
for automating bioinformatic analyses. For situations
where we are mostly running existing command line
tools, bash scripting will allow us to build pipelines with
minimal overhead. We'll start with simple command
lines and see how the Linux environment - though not
designed with biology in mind - is well suited to the
type of automation we need.
For situations where we don't have an existing tool avail-
able, and hence need to implement our own logic, bash
quickly becomes unwieldy - it's theoretically possible to
write complex programs in bash, but the experience is
painful! It's much better to use a more modern program-
ming language, and for most biological tasks Python
ts the bill.

Analysis of metagenetic data for macroecology workshop
Where: University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus
When: 2nd-8th October 2019
Fees: FREE for all participants
www.metagenecol.eu Workshop overview:
New sequencing methods are rapidly changing the analy-
sis of biodiversity. Metagenetics of community, ingested
or environmental samples generates high-resolution data
on composition, diversity and evolutionary history in a
fraction of the time of traditional methods. However,
using the great ood of DNA data for macroecology
requires new bioinformatics and statistical skills. This
course will teach procedures for the bioinformatic pro-
cessing of major types of genetic data for species compo-
sition and phylogeny. Statistical analysis of the resulting
biodiversity data will then be explored for community
analysis and patterns of diversity distribution. The
course is unique in that it takes students from the basics
of bioinformatics and data handling to advanced topics
in the use of large-scale DNA data in evolutionary and
ecological analysis. The course will comprise 5 days of
guided practicals using real-world data, supplemented
by short talks and thematic lectures. There will be open
time for discussions around issues in metagenetics, with
the particular aim of discussing participant queries and
ideas.
Instructors:
The instructors are prominent evolutionary biologists
and ecologists, who have developed many of the pro-
tocols and methodologies used in the analysis of meta-
genetic data for macroecology: Prof. Alfried P. Vogler
(Imperial College London and the Natural History Mu-
seum,UK), Dr. Carola G omez-Rodr guez (University
of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) and Dr. Thomas
J. Creedy (Natural History Museum, UK). The local
workshop organizers are Dr. Anna Papadopoulou and
Dr. Vasilis Promponas (University of Cyprus).
Workshop details:
There will be no fees for participants as the work-
shop is organized within the framework of the iBio-
Gen project under the Horizon 2020 Twinning funding
scheme (www.ibiogen.eu). Free coee breaks and lunch122 EvolDir May 1, 2019
during weekdays, as well as a free excursion on the
weekend, will be oered to all participants. However,
travel and accommodation costs should be covered by
the participants themselves.
The course is aimed at graduate students and early-
career researchers interested in applying novel DNA-
based methods to macroecological questions. The course
focuses on bioinformatic and analytical methods, and
participants are expected to have a working knowledge
of R for linear parametric statistics and basic commu-
nity data analysis. Some prior experience with the linux
command line is also preferred, although pre-course on-
line study materials will be available to all attendees
to ensure a common starting point. An understand-
ing of phylogenetics would be useful to get the most
of out of some sessions. For applications, please send
a Curriculum Vitae and a short motivation letter to
ibiogen.project@gmail.com by the 30th of May 2019.

Madrid IntroductionToNGS Jul1-5
Summer course available \INTRODUCTION TO
NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING: APPLICA-
TIONS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION" in Madrid
(Spain) July, 1st to 5th.
Dear Evoldir Comunity,
You can nd below the information about the summer
course \INTRODUCTION TO NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING: APPLICATIONS IN ECOLOGY AND
EVOLUTION" which whill take place in the Summer
School of Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid, from
1st to 5th, July. The Fundacion General CSIC and the
EVOLTREE network also support the course.
The course is aimed at graduates, postgraduates and
PhD students on Evolutionary Biology and related sci-
ences, interested in knowing the new tools and the poten-
tial that is being developed with the new techniques of
massive parallel sequencing. Senior researchers with aim
to be introduced in NGS applications are also welcome.
No specic training in bioinformatics is necessary.
The main objective of this course is to show a battery of
potential applications of the NGS by researchers who are
currently working with this technological approach. As
an introductory course, the main purpose is not looking124 EvolDir May 1, 2019
for a complex or deep training in a specic technique,
but to give a broad view of the available approaches.
The assistant to this course should end with the feeling
of knowing the techniques and their applications, with
the purpose of being able to assess which ones may be
interesting for their research or on which to deepen in
later stages.
The specic objectives are:
1. To present an updated information on the dierent
NGS techniques and their applications, potential and
complexity.
2. To provide basic training in the main software for
each of the techniques, as well as in data processing,
and give tips on how to expand knowledge. This in-
cludes from the quality analysis, edition and analysis of
the les to the interpretation of results. We aim that,
with this basic knowledge, the student can be trained
later if he is interested in a specic aspect of the ones
addressed (for example, attending specialized courses or
self-taught).
3. To favour the contact between students interested in
specic techniques with teachers and specialized person-
nel, for possible collaborations or training.
Course fees range from 10 e(in house sta) to
120e(students and unemployed) - 150 e(standar).

MADPHYLO 2019: Madrid Workshop in Statistical
Phylogenetics
Where: Real Jardin Botanico (CSIC), Madrid, Spain
When: 10th-19th June 2019
www.madphylo.com Course overview:
Darwin founded the eld of evolutionary biology on the
concept that all organisms are related to one another
through an unknown evolutionary tree. Phylogenetic
or evolutionary inference has become an essential toolin many disciplines across the life sciences, from molec-
ular epidemiology to paleontology. In this workshop,
the participants will learn the theoretical and technical
basis of stochastic modeling in evolutionary biology and
phylogenetics. The workshop will also provide full train-
ing in the open software RevBayes, an R-like interactive
environment based on graphical model concepts for the
modeling of complex evolutionary problems. At the end
of the workshop, the student will have an understand-
ing of the assumptions behind state-of-the-art methods
used in modern phylogenetic analysis, as well as being
able to build up new models from existing functions in
RevBayes.
Instructors:
The lecturers are prominent analytical systematists and
evolutionary biologists, who are behind the development
of many of the methodological and computing tools rou-
tinely used in modern phylogenetic inference and evo-
lutionary biology: Prof. John Huelsenbeck (University
of California, Berkeley), Prof. Brian Moore (University
of California, Davis), Dr. Michael R. May (University
of California, Davis), Prof. Sebastian Hoehna (Univer-
sity Ludwig-Maximilians, Munich), . The Workshop is
organized and directed by Dr. Isabel Sanmartin (Real
Jardin Botanico, CSIC, Madrid), who will also lecture.
Workshop details:
The course will be taught from June 10, 2019 to June
19, 2019. Lectures and practicals will be tightly linked,
meaning that you will learn the theory and also how
to apply the theory on the same day. Students are en-
couraged to bring their own laptops. The tuition for
the course is deliberately low, at only 450 Euros. This
tuition includes coee breaks and an informal American-
style make-your-own-sandwich lunch every day of the
workshop. However, tuition does not include lodging.
You will be required to nd a place to stay if you are
from outside of Madrid.

Ploen TransgenerationalInheritance
Nov6-8
Dear colleagues,
This is a reminder for our meeting on \Causes and
Consequences of Inclusive Inheritance", which will take
place at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Bi-
ology in Pl on, Germany, between the 6th and 8th of
November 2019. The abstract submission is open until
April 30th.
Meeting Description: Parental eects occur when the
phenotype of one or both parent(s) aects the phenotype
of ospring beyond the direct eects of genetic inheri-
tance. Eects can be maladaptive, for instance, when o-
spring lifespan and/or reproductive success are reduced
because of transgenerational senescence, or adaptive, for
example, when parasite exposure of parents primes theMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 127
immune responsiveness of ospring. From a mechanis-
tic perspective, the question which processes underlie
transgenerational inheritance remains open. Moreover,
from an evolutionary point of view, the tness conse-
quences of transgenerational inheritance and its impact
on adaptation to changing environments are also mostly
unknown. In this meeting, we aim to discuss examples of
transgenerational inheritance in natural populations of
non-model organisms, potential mechanisms underlying
such patterns, as well as its evolutionary underpinnings
and consequences.
Plenary speakers: Sandra Bouwhuis (Institute of Avian
Research, Germany), Alexei Maklakov (University of
East Anglia, UK), Eric Miska (University of Cambridge,
UK), Pat Monaghan (University of Glasgow, UK), Bram
Kuijper (University of Exeter, UK) & Tobias Uller
(Lund University, Sweden).
Format: Plenary talks are scheduled for 30 min (25 + 5
min for questions), classic talks for 15 min (12 + 3 min
for questions). Poster presenters are invited to give a 3
min ash talk at the start of the meeting to advertise
their poster prior to the poster session.
Costs: We do not charge a registration fee. A limited
number of travel grants will be available on a competitive
basis. To apply, please explain your funding situation, in-
dicate your motivation for joining the meeting and send
your abstract and CV to transgenin@evolbio.mpg.de.
Registration: Abstract submission is open until April
30th, registration until October 21st. We will in-
form participants about the outcome of abstract se-
lection by early June. For registration and ab-
stract submission, please use our website: https://-

The GTPB is proud to announce that the above refer-
enced hands-on training course is open for applications
Admission: Candidates with adequate prole will be
accepted in the next 72 hours after the application until
we reach 20 participants. Course description Genetic
and genomic data are increasingly used by ecologists and
evolutionary biologists in general. It has thus become
important for many biologists with dierent levels of ex-
perience to produce and analyse genetic (and genomic)
data. In this course we will take a practical approach
to the analysis of genetic and genomic data, but we will
also provide some of the theoretical background required
to understand the outputs of the software used. This
course will be organised so as to mix lectures where
important notions are introduced with practicals where
freely available software will be used. While this will
not be the focus of the course, we will also introduce
and discuss genealogical (coalescent-based) simulation
methods and those based on forward-in-time simulations.
Altogether this will allow to discuss the potentialities
and limitations of the tools available to the community.
In this ve-day course we will introduce the main con-
cepts that underlie many of the models that are fre-
quently used in population genetics. We will focus on
the importance of demographic history (e.g. eective
sizes and migration patterns) in shaping genetic data.
We will go through the basic notions that are central to
population genetics, insisting particularly on the statis-
tics used to measure genetic diversity and population
dierentiation. The course will also cover a short in-
troduction to coalescent theory, Bayesian inference in
population genetics and data simulation. We will also
introduce methods that have been recently developed to
analyse genomic data such as the PSMC method of Li128 EvolDir May 1, 2019
and Durbin that reconstructs the demographic history
of a species or population with the genome of a single
individual.
Most theory will be put into practice in practical ses-
sions, analyzing real and/or simulated datasets. In these
sessions, we will look at measures of genetic diversity and
dierentiation and use methods to infer demographic
history. We will learn how to perform coalescent simu-
lations of genetic/genomic data (using mainly Richard
Hudson's ms program). We will also show how to simu-
late data for PSMC analyses. This will allow users to
compare the PSMC obtained with real data to those
obtained for the models they used. We will also look at
how habitat fragmentation can be simulated using an
in-house program. Some exercises will make use of R
scripts (R being a freely available statistical program).
Basic R knowledge is a pre-requisite but we will provide
a short introduction to R. The R statistical package
is a very powerful tool to analyse data outputs from
many population genetics software, and can also be
used to simulate genetic data under simple demographic
scenarios.

The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include introductory lectures with class discus-
sions of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, results will
be interpreted and discussed in group.
Assumed Background
The course is aimed at students, researchers and profes-
sionals interested in learning how to build a structured
pipeline for semi-automated and reproducibile GWAS
analyses. It will include information useful for both
beginners and more advanced users. We will start by in-
troducing general concepts of GWAS and bioinformatics
pipeline building, progressively describing all steps and
putting there seamlessy together in a general workow.
Attendees should have a background in biology, speci-
cally genetics; previous exposure to GWAS experiments
would also be benecial.

Overview
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
growing eld of speciation genomics. The course aims
to take students from the initial steps required for han-
dling raw sequencing data to demographic modelling
and inference of genome-wide signatures of selection
and introgression. Through a combination of lectures
covering key theoretical and conceptual topics, along-
side hands-on exercises, participants will learn the most
important computational approaches used in speciation
genomics. This will include a heavy emphasis on data
visualization and intepretation. After completing of
the course, the participants should be able to begin
using NGS data to shed light on the genomic aspects of
speciation in their study system of choice.
Format
This course is designed for researchers and graduate
students with strong interests in applying novel high-
throughput DNA sequencing technologies to study the
population genomic basis of speciation. The course will
mainly focus on the analysis of NGS data for study
systems for which a reference genome is available. We
will provide theoretical lectures and hands-on exercises
drawing on examples of whole-genome resequenced and
RAD-sequencing data. Participants will make use of
the UNIX command line, R and Python throughout the
course.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background in
evolution and genomics. No programming or scripting
expertise is required. Previous experience in UNIX-
based command line and R is an advantage but a stan-
dard introduction will be provided. All hands-on ex-ercises will be run in a Linux environment on remote
servers. Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStu-
dio.
Learning Outcomes
Handling NGS data from raw reads to genetic variants
Applying basic population genetic statistics
Visualizing the genetic structure
Inferring demographic history
Identifying regions under divergent selection or barriers
to gene ow
Understanding the potential and limitations of dierent

graduate-and-professional/bioinformatics-analysis-
for-conservation-genomics/ This course is designed to
provide attendees at any career stage with a theoretical
understanding of the methods used in conservation
genomics along with the practical skills necessary to
design and carry out the analysis component of a
conservation genomics study. While an introduction
to the theoretical aspects of each of the analytical130 EvolDir May 1, 2019
steps will be given, the emphasis of the course will
be on hands-on training, enabling the participants
to complete the analysis steps behind a conservation
genomics study. Thus, the course will follow the
format of short lectures introducing each analytical
step, followed by hands-on activities during which
students will complete the corresponding analysis. The
course will begin with an overview of conservation
genomics, comparison of dierent next generation
sequencing platforms, and the analytical factors to
consider when beginning a conservation genomics study.
The rest of the course will focus on the bioinformatics
analysis behind a conservation study, including: genome
assembly (trimming, assembly techniques, quality
assessment), genome annotation, mapping low coverage
genome data to a reference genome, SNP calling,
demographic analysis, and estimation of genome-wide
diversity. These steps will all be accomplished with
real data used in a recent conservation genomics study
and performed on the Smithsonian High-Performance
Computing Cluster (SI/HPC). By the end of the course,
attendees will have acquired the necessary background
and applied knowledge to implement genomic analyses
for the conservation of endangered species.

UNewcastle EvolHumanBehavior
Jul29-Aug2
Dear researchers,
We are excited to announce the upcoming ALIFE Work-
shop on Evolution of Human Behaviour: Using Theory
to Address Societal Challenges.
This workshop will explore how research on the evo-
lution of human behaviour can be moved beyond the
theoretical realm to address societal challenges. It is
part of the ALIFE conference hosted in Newcastle (29th
July V 2nd August).
The workshop will be organised in two parts. The rst
1.5 hours will focus on the state-of-the-art theoretical
and modelling work. The second 1.5 hours will discuss
how this knowledge on the evolution of human behaviour
can contribute to (i) improve human societies, (ii) de-
sign articial societies, and (iii) develop the interface
between them. The workshop will emphasize the role of
new technology which can either conict with previous
behavioural adaptations or shape our cultural evolution.
It includes topics such as:
P From the evolution of morality to ethical articial
intelligence
P From the evolution of social behaviour to sustainable
socio- technical systems
P From the evolution of social learning to trustworthy
media
P From the evolution of institutions to democratic soci-
eties

UWashington ConservationGenetics
Jul8-10
We are pleased to advertise the Conservation Genet-
ics module of the Summer Institute of Statistical Ge-
netics at the University of Washington. This module
runs July 8-10, 2019 with instructors Dahlia Nielsen
and Nadia Singh. More information on the mod-
ule, including instructions for how to register, can
be found at: https://www.biostat.washington.edu/-
suminst/sisg2019/modules/SM1904 This new module
provides training in conceptual foundations and practi-
cal aspects of data analysis to understand conservation
and management of species. It will introduce the prin-
ciples and applications of conservation genetics, from
assessing the genetic health of individuals and whole pop-
ulations to deciding on species and sub-species divisions.
Students will learn foundational models in population
and evolutionary genetics, as well as core methods used
in genetics and genomics. Topics covered will include
genetic variation, dynamics of small populations, eec-
tive population size, population fragmentation and gene
ow, phylogeography, inbreeding and inbreeding depres-
sion, natural selection, ancient DNA and resurrecting
extinct organisms. The module will also cover methods
for developing genomic resources with an emphasis on
next generation sequence data generation and analy-
sis (RAD-seq, whole genome sequencing, transcriptome
sequencing).
Dahlia Nielsen is an Associate Professor of Biological
Sciences and a resident member of the Bioinformatics
Research Center at North Carolina State University.
Her research focuses on methods development and appli-
cations in identifying genes underlying complex traits,
including gene expression responses and molecular sig-
naling between hosts and pathogens. She has been en-
gaged in various projects to develop genomic resources
for non-model species.
Nadia Singh is an Associate Professor of Biology and
a member of the Institute for Ecology and Evolution
at the University of Oregon. Her research focuses on132 EvolDir May 1, 2019
the causes and consequences of variation in fundamen-
tal genetic processes for evolution. She is particularly
interested in phenotypic plasticity in recombination and
the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

Call for applications: Venice Summer School in Evo-
Devo, 26-30 August 2019 http://meetings.embo.org/-
event/19-evodevo *Topic*: *Mechanism in development
and evolution*
*Description*: Understanding organismal development
and evolution has been one of the greatest challenges for
biology since its beginnings. The central aim of develop-
mental biology is to uncover the mechanisms underlying
pattern formation and morphogenesis. By extension,
evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is consid-
ered to be a \mechanistic" science. But what exactly is
meant by \mechanism" in these contexts? What is a de-
velopmental mechanism, and how do these mechanisms
cause evolutionary change?
This summer school gathers a group of world-leading
empirical investigators and theoreticians from the elds
of developmental biology and evo-devo together with
modelers and philosophers of biology to investigate the
notion of developmental mechanism and its role in the
integration of developmental and evolutionary biology.
This integration lies at the heart of modern biology. Its
relevance goes beyond the scope of evo-devo, since an
understanding of the mapping from genotype to pheno-
type through metabolism, physiology, and development
is crucial in other elds, such as the genetic study of
complex disease and organismal behaviour.
This EMBOjFEBS Lecture Course is mainly aimed at
early-stage (PhD or postdoc) empirical and theoretical
researchers with a general background and interest in
developmental and/or evolutionary biology. More senior
investigators are welcome to apply as well. Exceptions
can be made for motivated masters students. Appli-
cants from non-biology elds who have some familiarity
and interest in evolutionary-developmental biology are
encouraged to apply.*Speakers*: Ingo Brigandt (Alberta) Graham Budd (Up-

Yunnan Metabarcoding Oct15-26
Yunnan Metabarcoding School 2019 (China)
We are pleased to announce the Yunnan Metabarcoding
School, 2019 edition.
DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method of eu-
karyotic biodiversity assessment that combines two tech-
nologies: DNA taxonomy and high-throughput DNA
sequencing. Applications range widely, from environ-
mental impact assessment, to diet reconstruction, to
paleoecology, to targeted species detection, among oth-
ers. Metabarcoding draws from methods developed in
eld ecology, systematics and phylogenetics, molecular
biology, bioinformatics, and statistics.
The 2019 Yunnan edition is allied to the metabarcod-
ing school started by the metabarcoding.org team and
shares some of the same instructors. This edition will
be hosted by the Kunming Institute of Zoology and is
nanced by a special fund from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) focused on aspects of Chinas Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI). As such, the school will be
preceded by a separate, one-day international conference
to launch a Horizon Scanning exercise for the BRI.
The Yunnan Metabarcoding School will be held from
15 - 26 October 2019, in two sections.
14 Oct 2019: Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Confer-
ence, Horizon Scanning 15-21 Oct 2019: Metabarcoding
School I (MSI): Metabarcoding & Metagenomics 22-
26 Oct 2019: Metabarcoding School II (MSII): R &
Laboratory Practicals
The school will fund airfares, in-China ground travel,
lodging, and meals for 30 students (including Ph.D. stu-
dents, postdocs, and professional researchers, dened
broadly). Students will be responsible for providing a
suitable laptop computer (details below) and paying for
their own out-of-China ground travel, tourist visa, and
personal purchases.
MSI: Our goal is to host 15 students from within China
and 15 students from other countries.
MSII: We expect approximately half the MSI students
to stay on for MSII.
Application, selection criteria, and preparation
Candidates can apply for the school by sending an
English-language email to the following address before31 May 2019: metabarcoding cas@mail.kiz.ac.cn
The email must contain the following in a single PDF
attachment (no portrait photos):
1. a brief CV 2. a letter of motivation indicating how
the applicant's research will benet from DNA-based
methods of biodiversity assessment (please rst review
the curriculum below, as we will cover both PCR-based
and metagenomic methods). The core of the letter is
a 150-200 word description of your research project.
Please indicate if you wish to attend MSI or MSI and
II.
In the (likely) case that we receive more than 30 ap-
plications (or more than 15 applications from outside
China), preference will be given to students
1. whose described project in the cover letter is well
developed and likely to benet immediately from the
skills learned, 2. who come from a Belt and Road Ini-
tiative (BRI) country 3. who are able to demonstrate
basic uency in molecular-ecology and bioinformatic
techniques (e.g. can use Unix and R on the command
line, can teach how PCR works) 4. who have sucient
English-language skills
Students must bring a laptop computer with the follow-
ing capacity: Y8 GB RAM, Y150 GB SSD free storage,
and natively boots into macOS or Ubuntu Linux.
We will assign preparatory homework to the accepted
students.
Instructors
- Kristine Bohmann (Natural History Museum of Den-
mark) - Frdric Boyer (LECA, CNRS, France) - Anthony
Chariton (Macquarie University, Australia) - Shyam
Gopalakrishnan (Natural History Museum of Denmark)
- Min Tang (China Agricultural University) - Shanlin
Liu (Natural History Museum of Denmark) - Douglas
Yu (Kunming Institute of Zoology; University of East
Anglia, UK) - Additional instructors from the Kunming
Institute of Zoology
Curricula
The school will be divided into lectures and practi-
cals, taught in English, with Chinese-uent instructors
present.
Metabarcoding School I: The lectures will cover dierent
aspects of DNA metabarcoding and metagenomics as
applied to eukaryotes. The obitools and DAMe practi-
cals will let students run metabarcoding pipelines from
raw sequences to species x sample tables, plus visu-
alisations in R. The i/eDNA practical will introduce
students to water sampling using lters. We will also
run computer-based practicals in PCR primer design,134 EvolDir May 1, 2019
taxonomic assignment, and metagenomic methods as
applied to eukaryotic species (see Ji et al. 2019, Peel
et al. 2019). Note that this course does not cover
bacterial/archaeal/viral biodiversity.
All students will have to give a ash talk (7 mins) about
their project and how it will benet from DNA-based
methods of biodiversity assessment. In the evenings,
we will run aoSaw One, Did One, Now Teach One exercise, in which students will divide into groups of
three and

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
AfterwordMay 1, 2019 EvolDir 135
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
