Dear Colleague:
This is to invite you to attend a National Academy
of Sciences Sackler Colloquium on Systematics and
the Origin of Species. On Ernst Mayr’s 100th An-
niversary, to be held December 16-18, 2004 at the
Beckman Center of the National Academies of Sci-
ences and Engineering in Irvine, California. The
following information, and Preliminary Program and
Registration Forms, can be accessed at the NAS
web site. http://www4.nationalacademies.org/nas/-
nashome.nsf/urllinks/NAS-58MTTC?OpenDocument
The Colloquium will celebrate the 100th birthday of
the eminent evolutionist Ernst Mayr and the 62nd an-
niversary of the publication of his Systematics and the
Origin of Species (1942), one of the four books often
considered as the foundations of the modern theory of
evolution. The Colloquium will explore the main top-
ics in Mayr’s book and examine the same (and related)
issues in the light of current science, although the focus
will be on speciation, rather than on systematics.
Attendance at the Colloquium is limited to 250 reg-
istered individuals. To facilitate the participation of
younger scientists, we request that you extend this in-
vitation to interested graduate students and postdocs.
The NAS has provided funds to supplement the ex-
penses of participating graduate students and postdocs
up to $100 for hotel costs and $150 for air travel. A
maximum of 100 awards will be granted, with priority
based exclusively on the order in which requests (ac-
companied by the registration fee) are received. Noti-
ﬁcation of the award will be made shortly after receiv-
ing the application but the awards will be paid after
the Colloquium, upon documentation of qualifying ex-
penses. The Travel/Hotel Award Form is attached.
Registrations will be accepted only when the registra-
tion fee is included and in the order in which they are
received. The registration fee is $350, which includes
the cost of meals, reception, and banquet. However, an
early registration fee of $250 (also including meals, re-
ception, and banquet) is available to those posting their
registration by November 1, 2004. And, a reduced all-
inclusive registration fee of $100 is oﬀered to Graduate
Students and Postdocs who register by November 1st.
A block of hotel rooms has been reserved at the Hy-
att Newporter Resort at a discount rate of $106, plustax, for a single or a double. Hotel reservations must
be made when registering (see Registration Form for
more information). Hotel reservations must be made by
November 24, 2004. Please do not call the hotel directly
for room reservations, as they can only accept reserva-
tions through the NAS. Shuttle bus service between the
hotel and the Beckman Center will be provided free of
charge at speciﬁed times.

2004 Winter ASAB - Phylogenies and Behaviour
2nd and 3rd December 2004 Meetings Rooms of the
Zoological Society of London, Regent1s Park (next to
London Zoo), UK.
Open meeting: no prior registration or registration fee
ASAB Winter meetings are very informal two-day con-
ference with no registration fees and no accommodation
booking service is provided (but London has a wide of-4 EvolDir November 2, 2004
fer of places to stay from B&B to 5-star hotels that can
be book in advance through the London Tourism Oﬃce
or via Internet). Accordingly there is no formal social
program apart from a wine reception and art exhibition
at the London Zoo on the Thursday evening, and free
entrance to the Zoo.
The scientiﬁc program will consist of a combination of
invited speakers and contributed talks, with an empha-
sis on case studies in which phylogenies have helped
in the understanding of animal behaviour. There will
also be a smaller number of talks aimed at summariz-
ing recent developments in phylogenetic methods and
highlighting the importance of these new insights for
the study of animal behaviour.
Invited speakers include Goran Arnqvist (Uppsala),
Tim Barraclough (Imperial), Robert Barton (Durham),
Rob Freckleton (Oxford), Nick Goodwin (UEA), Ruth
Mace (UCL), Jim Mallet (UCL), Peter Mayhew (York),
Mike Ryan (Texas), Ole Seehausen (Bern), Michael

Announcement:
Online Conference - “Biosafety Considerations in the
use of Genetically Modiﬁed Organisms for Manage-
ment of Animal Populations”. Modern biotechnology
can provide innovative approaches to management
of animal populations, but what about potential
risks? This online conference will facilitate exchange
of views on a range of important issues such as the
use of GM microorganisms, nematodes and insects
for biological control (including those used to cause
sterility in pest species for conservation and/orcommercial purposes); the use of GM viruses to
protect mammal populations against disease; and
the use of GM insects for reducing disease trans-
mission rates. The conference will be hosted on
the Biosafety Clearing-House from 18 October to 15
November 2004. To join, visit http://bch.biodiv.org/-

Dear Colleague,
We are hosting this year’s New England Molecular Evo-
lutionary Biologists (NEMEB) meeting at Tufts Uni-
versity on November 6th. We hope that you and/or
members of your lab can attend this free regional meet-
ing. NEMEB provides a forum for molecular evolu-
tionists to present their work and interact with one an-
other in an informal setting. Students, post-doctoral re-
searchers, and principal investigators are encouraged to
present their work. This year’s meeting format will be
similar to past years and will consist of a combination of
three invited talks, a series of contributed talks (we will
have as many as 14 slots), and a poster session. This
years invited speakers are: Tom Kocher (University of
New Hampshire), Dick Lewontin (Harvard University),
and Peter Gogarten (University of Connecticut). In
past years, between 100-150 researchers have attended
the meeting. It will be held on Saturday, November
6th, in Pearson Hall at Tuft University’s Medford cam-pus. The meeting will run from approximately 8:00
a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with a poster session and social hour
to follow.
For registration and abstract submissions, please
visit our website at http://www.tufts.edu/vet/richlab/-
nemeb . Abstract submissions are due by October 17th.
Please be sure to indicate your choice of talk or poster;
and be aware that we have a limited number of talk slots
available. We’ll let all abstract-submitters know their
fate, i.e. whether they’ve been selected for a talk or
poster, by October 27th. These decisions will be made
in part on a “ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served” basis, but we also
try to set things up so there is fair distribution among
institutions, topics, etc.. As an added incentive this
year, Sinauer Associates has oﬀered a $25 gift certiﬁ-
cate to all registrants chosen to give a talk at NEMEB
XV.
Hope to see you there!

To population biologists of every stripe:
The faculty and students of the UCSD EBE Section are
delighted to invite you to this year’s CalPEG, which will
be held on the weekend of Dec. 10-12. We welcome stu-
dents, postdocs and faculty to join us in a relaxed and
informal setting on our beautiful campus. We also en-
courage you to give a short presentation of your work.
Following the CalPEG tradition, we encourage talks
about work in progress as well as ﬁnished reports. This
will enable students partway through their thesis work
to get the beneﬁt of lots of feedback from the other
participants. And this year we want to extend a spe-
cial welcome to ECOLOGISTS, reﬂecting the fact that
ecology and evolution are becoming more and more in-
tertwined with each passing year.
Please spread the word in your labs, and send this an-
nouncement to your local lists so that other people on
your campus who are not on our mailing list can learn
about the meeting.
Talks will be 15 minutes (12 minutes with three min-
utes for questions). We will have facilities for Power-
point presentations and overheads. We would love it if
you could bring your Powerpoint ﬁle on a CD, as this
would speed up the transition between speakers.6 EvolDir November 2, 2004
Instructions for registration and a form to be printed
out and sent in along with your check will be found on
the CalPEG website, http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/-
labs/chao/calpeg04 The meeting will begin with a
mixer at our International Center on the evening of
Friday the 10th, followed by presentations all day Sat-
urday and Sunday morning. Registration is $30 for all
comers, which covers the mixer, a box lunch on Sat-
urday, and dinner on Saturday evening at the Interna-
tional Center, along with plenty of additional oppor-
tunities to keep your blood sugar and caﬀeine levels
high. To keep costs down, we ask that you specify
your dietary and booze preferences on the registration
form. A number of our graduate students have vol-
unteered ﬂoor space in their apartments for students
from other campuses. We have also listed three nearby
inexpensive motels on the web site, and all of them
allow multiple occupants in a room. BUT PLEASE
REGISTER EARLY AND MAKE YOUR ACCOM-
MODATION ARRANGEMENTS EARLY, BECAUSE
WE CANNOT GUARANTEE MOTEL OR FLOOR
SPACE!
FINAL DEADLINE FOR REGISTRATION IS NOV.

PhD position

mission
PhD studentship in Evolutionary Genomics
A 3 year PhD studentship funded by the FP6 NoE “Ma-
rine Genomics Europe” ( http://www.sb-roscoﬀ.fr/-
marine-genomics-europe ) is available to study the evo-
lutionary genomics of marine bivalves. The student
will join a collaborative study between several labs
of the Fish & Shellﬁsh node of the NoE but will
be based in France among three labs: The Labora-
tory “Evolution et G´ en´ etique des Populations Marines”
(Station Biologique, Roscoﬀ, France), the Laboratory
“G´ en´ etique et Pathologie” (IFREMER, LaTremblade,
France) and the Laboratory “G´ enome, Populations,
Interactions, Adaptation” (Station M´ editerran´ eenne
l’Environnement Littoral, S` ete, France).
The aim of the PhD thesis will be to analyse polymor-
phism levels and divergence rates in coding DNA se-
quences of two marine bivalves: the cupped oysters ofthe genus Crassostrea and hydrothermal vent mussels
of the genus Bathymodiolus.
Marine bivalves exhibit one of the highest enzyme di-
versities reported in animal species to date. We are
thus expecting to obtain datasets with a high density
of polymorphic sites, allowing us to precisely estimat-
ing the selective constraints on proteins. In addition,
the presence of hybrid zones in the two genera (between
Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata, and between Bathy-
modiolus azoricus and B. puteoserpentis) could be used
as selective ﬁlters to identify chromosomal chunks, or
even genes involved in reproductive isolation.
Candidates with a M.Sc. or equivalent obtained this
year (in 2004), with an interest in evolutionary ge-
netics and marine sciences, preferably with an expe-
rience in molecular techniques, bioinformatics (ESTs
annotation) and marine ecosystems (and especially hy-
drothermal vents) with a good to moderate knowl-
edge of French should send via e-mail a letter of
motivation, a CV, and the names and e-mail of
1 referee before the ﬁrst of November 2004 to Di-
dier Jollivet (jollivet@sb-roscoﬀ.fr) and Pierre Boudry

NCStateU QuantitativeTraits
Department of Genetics at North Carolina State Uni-
versity
Research Training Program in the Genetic Architecture
of Quantitative Traits
The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of
the National Institutes of Health has awarded the De-
partment of Genetics an Institutional Research Train-
ing Grant for predoctoral training in “The Genetic Ar-
chitecture of Quantitative Traits.”
Quantitative, or complex, traits are aﬀected by multi-
ple interacting genes, each of which have small eﬀects
and are sensitive to the environment. Understanding
the molecular nature of genetic variation for quantita-
tive traits will have an enormous impact on medicine,
livestock and crop breeding, and the study of evolution.
For over half a century North Carolina State University
has been a leading center for research in quantitative
genetics. To enable future scientists to advance our un-
derstanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative
traits, we oﬀer a research and training program that in-
tegrates quantitative, population, molecular and devel-
opmental genetics, statistics and molecular evolution.
Our program oﬀers:
* $20,772 stipend with tuition and health insurance *
Travel allowance and research funds * State-of-the-art
research facilities * Internationally recognized faculty
with expertise in theoretical and experimental quanti-
tative genetics * A stimulating academic environment
near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Duke University and the Research Triangle Park * A
beautiful and aﬀordable location with a pleasant cli-
mate between the beaches and the Appalachian moun-
tains
US citizens and permanent residents are eligible for
Fellowships. The Department of Genetics is strongly
committed to promoting diversity in the scientiﬁc com-
munity and encourages applications from individuals of
historically under-represented minority groups.

TrophicInteractions
Graduate Student Position, Tritrophic Interactions
A graduate student position (M. S. or PhD.) is available
in the Fall of 2005 for a highly motivated student to join
an NSF-funded research project to study tritrophic in-
teractions in a natural system. In southern California,
plants of Datura wrightii produce leaves that are cov-
ered either with glandular or non-glandular trichomes.
Glandular trichomes secrete defensive chemicals, and
plants with glandular trichomes are resistant to many
of D. wrightii’s insect herbivores. The primary objec-
tive of this position is to test the working hypothesisNovember 2, 2004 EvolDir 11
that glandular trichomes of Datura wrightii impede the
natural enemies of D. wrightii’s herbivores and reduce
the beneﬁts of producing glandular trichomes. Such re-
ductions may constrain the increase in the frequency of
glandular genotypes.
The preference and performance of natural enemies at-
tacking herbivores on plants with glandular or nong-
landular trichomes will be emphasized. Potential ar-
eas of investigation can include: 1) analyses of insect
behavior after manipulating the concentration of de-
fensive chemicals, 2) orientation and host-ﬁnding be-
haviors of herbivores and natural enemies to volatile
chemicals from plants varying in trichome morphology,
or 3) community-level analyses of herbivores and natu-
ral enemies on plants varying in trichome morphology
in natural populations.

PhD project in plant population genetics
A3-year PhD project is available in the Department of
Community Ecology at the UFZ-Centre for Environ-
mental Research Leipzig-Halle GmbH from 01.12.2004
funded by the German Ministry of Education and Sci-
ence (BMBF).
In the project genetic diversity of plant species will becompared between populations in spontaneously col-
onized antropogenous secondary habitat and adjacent
seminatural primary habitats, e.g. on mining sites or
industrial fallows. Such secondary habitat can harbour
high biodiversity and may be valuable for nature con-
servation. However, it is unknown, to which degree ge-
netic diversity of the colonizing species is comparable
to their original sites. At the same time, such habitats
may be prone to selection of new genotypes and mi-
croevolution. We will use molecular markers to anal-
yse genetic diversity and population structure, deter-
mine colonization processes (e.g. source populations)
and microevolutionary processes (e.g. intraspeciﬁc hy-
bridisation) during the course of succession. The work
will be accomplished by analyses of plant ﬁtness and
demography.
The project is part of the network SUBICON succes-
sional change and biodiversity conservation within the
framework of the BMBF-focus Biodiversity and Global
change (BIOLOG)
The successful candidate is expected to have a diploma
or similar degree in Biology. We are looking for an in-
dependently acting person with interest in population
biology and evolutionary biology of plants and nature
conservation. Practical experience in analyses of molec-
ular genetic markers (e.g. microsatellites, AFLP) and
plant population biological methods, and the use of ap-
propriate statistical methods is advantageous. Further

Ph.D. position in comparative phylogenetics and phy-
logeography
Research project:
A Ph.D. position will be available to join a DFG-funded
project in the framework of the priority program “The
impact of climate variability on aquatic ecosystems
(AQUASHIFT)”. The candidate will study the relative
role of climate variability on the species ranges of Euro-
pean freshwater pulmonates (Gastropoda). Integrating
a phylogenetical informed, macroecological (top-down)
and a population based, phylogeographic (bottom-up)
approach, factors shaping the geographical ranges of
this taxon will be analysed comprehensively, using a
wide variety of observational and experimental meth-
ods in a phylogenetically informed framework. Beyond
the importance for our understanding of the processes
governing the distribution and biodiversity of this taxon
in space and time, the ultimate aim of the study is to
provide a base for the prediction of future range changes
due to global warming scenarios.
Requirements:
The desired candidate will possess experience in a num-
ber of bench skills (such as DNA extraction, PCR, and
sequencing). At least basic knowledge in (phylogenet-
ical) statistics is required. Experience with ecological
experiments would be desirable, but is not a necessary
prerequisite.
The Abteilung ¨Okologie & Evolution has several well
equipped laboratories, dedicated to the study of phy-
logeography, phylogenetics, evolutionary genetics, evo-
lutionary ecology and evolutionary ecotoxicology. As
such, it provides a rich international academic environ-
ment for those interested in the proximate and ultimate
causes for the limits of species ranges.
The position depends on a ﬁnal funding agreement
of the DFG. If granted, initially two years of fund-
ing are available. The salary will be according to
German BATIIa 1/2 which depends on age and fam-
ily status (approx. ~1000 ???/month). To apply,
email a statement of research interests, a CV and the
email addresses of two references to Markus Pfenninger.(Pfenninger@zoology.uni-frankfurt.de).
The funding starts most probably at the beginning of
2005, applications will be considered until the position
is ﬁlled.

PhD SCHOLARSHIP IN ZOOLOGY
DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF
OTAGO DUNEDIN, NEW ZEALAND
Evolutionary biology of parasites
Applications are invited from suitably qualiﬁed stu-
dents for one PhD scholarship to work under the super-
vision of Prof Robert Poulin. The scholarship is funded
by the Marsden Fund and is available as of early 2005for three years.
Our research programme aims to investigate the inﬂu-
ence of relatedness among parasites sharing the same
host on the parasites’ strategies of development and
host exploitation. The research will involve three local
trematode species, parasitic in freshwater or intertidal
ecosystems, all amenable to both ﬁeld and laboratory
investigations. The work involves (1) characterising mi-
crosatellite loci and genotyping individual parasites at
multiple loci to estimate levels of relatedness (or clon-
ality) in ﬁeld-infected hosts, and (2) in laboratory ex-
periments, using single- and multiple-clone infections
to quantify the growth of parasites in their host, their
ability to alter host behaviour, and their likelihood to
abbreviate their life cycle. The PhD project will ﬁt
within this overall theme. Candidates should have in-
terests and/or experience in either host-parasite inter-
actions or molecular ecology. More importantly, can-
didates should be highly motivated and enthusiastic
about this sort of research.
PhD applicants must have been awarded the degree of
BSc Honours or MSc before taking up the scholarship.
The emolument is NZ$22,000 per annum for 3 years.
There is an additional NZ$4,000 per year to cover tu-
ition fees, and some money available in the ﬁnal year
for thesis preparation costs.

GRADUATE STUDIES IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLU-
TION AT VANDERBILT
Dear colleagues and prospective students,
The Department of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt
University seeks interested and highly motivated grad-
uate students to join a group of laboratories with com-
plementary research interests focusing on ecological and
genetic mechanisms of evolutionary diversiﬁcation. On-
going research investigates all stages of evolutionary
diversiﬁcation (population structure, reproductive iso-
lation, speciation, phylogenetic radiation) and several
fundamental ecological processes (adaptation, ecologi-
cal specialization, symbiosis, social interactions).
Our group occupies a new (2002) building complete
with our own DNA sequencing facility, abundant envi-
ronmentally controlled rooms, and an adjoining state-
of-the-art greenhouse. Vanderbilt researchers enjoy the
participation of excellent undergraduates and the re-
sources of a thriving medical center. Our beautiful
campus is located in the heart of Nashville, a friendlyand inexpensive city situated amidst the lush rolling
hills of biologically diverse middle Tennessee. Gradu-
ate students receive generous stipends and are trained
in a highly interactive inter-lab community.
Ecology & Evolution faculty, research interests include:
Patrick Abbot (abbot@uts.cc.texas.edu) - social evolu-
tion, symbioses, molecular evolutionary genetics in in-
sects and microbes
John Burke (john.m.burke@vanderbilt.edu) - genetic
basis of adaptation and speciation in plants
Dan Funk (daniel.j.funk@vanderbilt.edu) - ecological
specialization and speciation, phylogenetics, herbivo-
rous insect biology
Manuel Leal (manuel.leal@vanderbilt.edu) - animal
communication and mate choice, predator-prey inter-
actions, and sensory ecology in lizards
Dave McCauley (david.e.mccauley@vanderbilt.edu) -
population biology, population structure, local adap-
tation in plants and insects
For further information on research and graduate study
at Vanderbilt, please consult our departmental web

EmoryU 2 EvolBiol
Dear Colleagues:
The Biology Department at Emory University is cur-
rently searching for two Assistant (or possibly higher
rank) Professors in Evolutionary Biology. Our adver-
tisement, below, suggests we are recruiting “molecular
geneticists” who study evolution and we do indeed re-
quire that the candidates be composed of molecules.
However, we are looking for the very best people in evo-
lutionary biology, broadly deﬁned; whether they con-
sider them themselves “molecular geneticists” or not.
If you see yourself in this “very best” evolutionary biol-
ogist category and are not opposed to working at well-
endowed, supportive university in a beautiful and pro-
gressive city (Atlanta really is that), I strongly urge you
to apply for this position.

Expansion of the Department of Biology at Portland
State University continues this year with the addition
of faculty members in the areas of plant systemat-ics, plant physiology, genetics, and microbial physiol-
ogy/ecology. We expect to continue to add new faculty
for the next three to ﬁve years to build on our thematic
strengths in ecology and evolutionary biology, environ-
mental genomics, conservation biology, extremophile
biology, physiology and behavior, and science educa-
tion. We are particularly interested in applications
from individuals whose interests and research activities
span one or more of the above areas. More information
about the department can be found on our web site:

sirable.
Experimental Geneticist: We seek an individual work-
ing with established non-mammalian genetic systems
or with emerging or novel systems. The ideal candi-
date would combine genetic, molecular and genomic ap-
proaches to understanding key concepts of cell and/or
organismal biology

AFLPs
Hi,
I’ve been using the AFLP Analysis System I kit from
Invitrogen with ﬁsh DNA, but I’ve experienced some
problems - no pre-ampliﬁcated DNA. I believe the prob-
lem might be on the ligation of adapters, but I got no
conclusive data on this. Has any of you had similar
experience? Do you have any clues on what might be
going wrong?
Thanks in advance!

BeckmanSEQ2000 FragmentAnalysis
We are about to start a project that involves large scale
microsatellite analyses. We have at hand a BeckmanSEQ2000XL that until now has been dedicated to EST-
sequencing. But since it also comes with software for
fragment analysis, we’re considering to use it for our mi-
crosatellite runs. However, some people I have spoken
to have recomended us to upgrade to a newer Beckman
machine, such as the SEQ8000, for fragment analysis
(for reasons that were not all that clear to me).
Is there anyone who use or have used an SEQ2000
for fragment analysis that can give me some input on
how well it works? Also, I would appreciate some
input on how the SEQ2000 rates compared to other,
newer, Beckman machines and whether an upgrade re-
ally worth all the money or not?
Sincerely,

Cassowary eggs
Dear Evoldir members,
In the scope of a project that is to be set up, we are
looking for a place where we can get (buy) fertile cas-
sowary eggs.November 2, 2004 EvolDir 37
Eggs of other ratites are fairly easy to get from ostrich
farms. However, as far as I know cassowaries are not
commonly kept at such farms. Does anyone know of
a place where we can get fertile cassowary eggs? And
maybe also of other places besides farms where we can
get ratite eggs? Eggs from farms tend to be quite ex-
pensive..

DNA from hair
Dear Evoldirs,
I am extracting DNA form hairs but I have few prob-

SDS, NaCl, EDTA, Pro K, Tris-HCl ) some of them.
The black hairs (from all geographical origin) are di-
gested in 12 hours but the white/yellow are not digest,
even after 5 days of incubation (56C)!!!
Is there someone who met the same kind of problems
or have an explanation/hypothesis?Thanks Francois,

DNA from hair answers
Dear members,
Thank you very much for your answers. I post them
below for all the people that are interested in them.
Kind regards, FX Ricaut.
Hello Francois. Check out the following protocol op-
timized forensic samples: Walsh et al. 1991 (Biotech-
niques: 506-513). It is based on the use of CHELEX
100-Resin (BioRad) to extract DNA even from crude
remainders of cell tissue or hair. Good luck. S´ ebastien
Francois Hair shafts are made of keratin and contain no
cells and therefore no DNA If you are extracting DNA
from these samples, then it will be from hair bulb or
other cells on the outside of the hair shaft If you can-
not see a hair bulb it may be present + dried up In
any case- digesting the hair follicle won’t help with the
DNA extraction there may be cause to be worried about
contamination of the hair samples with other cells also
Carolyn you shouldn’t need to digest the hair - just lyse
the cells in the hair bulb to release the DNA so it can
be PCR’d
Dear Francois! I don’t do hair extractions but I am us-
ing NaOH/Tris/HCl extractions for nematode worms
and I freeze them after I place the worm into NaOH.
It seems to help with breaking up the cuticle. Just a
thought. Good luck, Birgit
Francois, It has been my experience that one does not
need to digest the entire hair–just the follicle end. I
recommend using the standard Chelex methods (just
Chelex and H2O, no proteinase needed). If you would
like, I will forward you my protocol. Chris Sorry, I do
not have a protocol for the shafts. I might still try the
Chelex protocol, though, because you can boil the hair
in a small solution, say 100-200 microliters, and have
the DNA highly concentrated, though with potential
inhibitors. The inhibitors could be gotten around by
adding a little BSA to the PCR. I think the main prob-38 EvolDir November 2, 2004
lem you are going to have is with low DNA concentra-
tion, though.

Dear Francois, I don’t have any explanations to oﬀer,
but I’d be very interested in hearing the responses you
get, as we are digesting hair here also. We’ve got good
results using Promega’s DNA IQ kit (meant for foren-
sics). Both squirrel hair and human hair (in a variety of
colours including yellow) is compeletly dissolved using
a combination of their ’Tissue & hair extraction kit’,
which contains proteinase K and DTT (probably SDS
also), and the lysis buﬀer from the DNA IQ kit. Sadly,
the indgredients of the lysis buﬀer are not listed. Good

Aloha Francois, I’m afraid that I have no insights into
your question. May I say, however, that a simple chelex
extraction (5% chelex incubated 56C ~10 min, vortex,
incubate boiling water bath ~8min, vortex, spin for 30s
and take from the supernatant for your PCR reaction
avoid the chelex beads as they will chelate the Mg in
your reaction) worked very well for me in a popula-
tion study of orangutan. Hope that helps. Cam Cam

Hi Franois! Can you clarify me just one doubt? Do
you want the hair digested or the hair bulb? What are
you doing the DNA hairs for? Microsatellites, mtDNA
analysis? The hair bulb is readily digested by the tem-
perature eﬀect. I have some protocols that I can suggest
you if you want to, but the easiest one is using the hair
bulb directly in the PCR mix, without even doing any
extraction procedure. It works ﬁne and the DNA needs
only the temperature from the PCR to be “extracted”.
Best wishes, Cristina Luis
Hi Francois, It seems that some hairs are simply re-
sistant to proteinase K due to their structure. I don’t
think there is anything formal published on this, but
I have read various descriptions on the matter on the
web. One way that I have found suitable in getting
around this issue is to boost the levels of SDS and DTT
you use. Also you may want to remove the EDTA com-
pletely, as it hinders the proteinase K and isn’t really
necessary in the digestion mix. I recently developed
a new method of digesting hair (based on a protocolpublished elsewhere by Pfeiﬀer et al) that you might
want to try. I personally ﬁnd that it is superior to the
usual methods. In essence, make up a digestion mix
containing (at ﬁnal concentration) 100mM Tris pH 8
100mM NaCl 3mM CaCl2 (this is a great ingredient
that appears to boost the rate of proteinase K activity)
2% SDS 40 mM Dithiotreitol (DTT) (approximately)
250 ?g/ml Proteinase K (approximately) I normally use
about 0.75 ml of this mixture for a couple of cm of hair
shaft.

Eel samples
Dear Colleagues.
Under the co-direction of Prof. Axel Meyer and Dr.
Thierry Wirth, (Ref. 1,2) I am currently studying the
genetic structure of past and recent Atlantic eel popu-
lations (Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata). Moreover,
we have also developed genetic markers in order to in-
vestigate the population structure of eel swimbladderNovember 2, 2004 EvolDir 39
parasites (Anguillicola crassus; Ref. 3). This nema-
tode might be involved in the dramatic decline of eel
stocks during the last twenty years. We want to de-
termine the number of successive waves that led to the
arrival of the parasite from infected Japanese eels. We
also want to date these events and compare the speed
and the strength of the parasite spread in Europe and
North America using a coalescence approach.
Therefore we are looking for:
- historical glass eel samples from the North-American
coast, from the North, the Baltic and the Mediter-
ranean Seas (covering the whole of the 20th century,
in ethanol, frozen or even in formol).
- recent Anguillicola crassus samples from Europe and
Asia (in ethanol).
I would be grateful if you can help me getting this bio-
logical material. For a Pdf-Reprint of References 1 & 2

Enzyme restrictions
Hi Folks,
I’m attempting to restrict genomic DNA recovered from
bryozoans using a Qiagen kit and ﬁnd large diﬀerences
between samples in the success of the restriction (all
work to a certain extent but some show evidence of a
band of intact genomic DNA). The best results were
obtained when the enzymes were brand new (Mse I
and EcoRI from NEB), however they’ve been properly
stored at -20 with very limited thawing/refreezing and
work on other species, so I doubt that the enzymeshave degraded. They have also been used since on
other species with good results. I know that you could
probably write a book about optimising restriction re-
actions, however, can anybody suggest a few “tricks of
the trade” which may help the reproducibility.
Thanks in advance, Bill Hutchinson

Individual inbreeding coeﬀs
Hello all,
I am currently engaged in a project studying the pop-
ulation genetics of Rio Grande cutthroat trout using
microsatellites. We have found signiﬁcant heterozygote
deﬁciency in many of our populations. This appears
to be a genuine phenomenon rather than the result of
artifacts such as null alleles and we are therefore in-
terested in investigating it further. One possibility is
that these heterozygote deﬁciencies are due to inbreed-
ing, for example because dispersal of sibs is limited by
physical boundaries within a stream. We have taken40 EvolDir November 2, 2004
the approach of calculating Ritlands (1996) individual
inbreeding coeﬃcient for each individual in the popu-
lation. We can then ask the question- is the median
inbreeding coeﬃcient signiﬁcantly greater than would
be expected if mating was random with respect to re-
latedness? However, it is unclear what approach we
should be using to calculate the signiﬁcance.
Currently, we are randomly permuting alleles between
individuals in order to simulate a sample of ﬁsh which
would result from random mating and comparing the
true median individual inbreeding coeﬃcient to the
distribution of medians from 2000 of these simulated
samples. Using this approach, a number of our true
medians fall outside the 95% conﬁdence limits of the
distribution of medians from the simulated data sets.
However, it has been suggested to us that the cor-
rect approach, since the sample deviates from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, is to permute single-locus geno-
types, rather than alleles, between individuals. This
approach retains much of the homozygosity present in
the original data set and therefore none our true me-
dians fall outside the 95% conﬁdence interval of our
simulated medians. Since we are intending to compare
the results that we observe with those which would be
expected from random mating with respect to kinship
(i.e. a population which does not deviate from HW
equilibrium), then we are unsure whether this actually
is the correct approach. Can anyone enlighten us fur-
ther?
Thank you for your help.

Linkage analysis answers
Thanks to everyone who responded to my question
regarding software programs available for calculating
Lewontin’s D’ (standardized Linkage Disequilibrium).
Since posting my question, I have found that Arlequin
software V. 2.000 will also calculate D and D’ values
for each loci pair (using microsatellites and RFLP co-
dominant nuclear loci), but will not give a value over
all pairwise comparisons for a given population.
For those of you who expressed an interest, I have in-
cluded the responses that I received.

McDonaldKreitman test
Dear Evoldir members, Im performing a nucleotide
variability survey in a gene region of a Drosophila
species and I have several doubts about the interpre-
tation of the results of the McDonald-Kreitman test.
According to it, my sample has an excess of non syn-
onymous polymorphism and I found in the literature
three hypothesis to explain such result: changes in the
selective constraint of the gene, selection against dele-
terious mutations and episodic selection. My species
also has an excess of singletons in synonymous and non
synonymous sites that may be due to a recent popu-
lation expansion, because this pattern is also present
in other gene regions. Can I say that this change in
Ne is not responsible for the departures in neutrality42 EvolDir November 2, 2004
in MK because the pattern is absent in other genes? I
ask because although the change in Ne should have af-
fected all the genome in the same way, the relationship
between Ne and s (that determines the selective con-
straint) could be diﬀerent for each gene. I also wonder
how I can distinguish between selection against delete-
rious mutations and episodic selection if demography is
aﬀecting the spectrum frequency. I appreciate any sug-
gestions that you can send me. Kind regards, Romina

McDonaldKreitman test answers
Dear members, Thank you very much for your answers.
I post them below for all the people that are interested
in them. Kind regards, Romina.

Dear Romina
In my opinion, it is going to be diﬃcult to distinguish
between poopulation growth or positive selection, or
even background selection just from intraespecies poly-
morphism data. The frequency spectrum can be diﬀer-
ent for every gene depending on many variables, includ-
ing theta (the parameter reﬂecting the combined eﬀect
of mutation and population size), recombination rate,
gene conversion, the intensity of selection, etc. In this
context the history of a gene is diﬃcult to compare if
you do not know for sure the history of the gene you
are comparing it with.
Have you done a Ka/Ks test? This might give you some
clues on the direction of selection...
In any case I would be grateful if you could send me
the answers to your question.
all the best
santos
*********
You can try to look only at replacement and syn. poly-
morphism that are more than 15% frequent. This
should test for the possibility that you have a signif-
icant number of slightly deleterious AA polymorphisms
biasing the MK test.

—————————————————There have been various discussions on the excess of
nonsynonymous polymorphisms. I recommend you to
read Rand and Kann, Mol Biol Evol 13, 735-748(1996)
and Mes,Jour Mol Evol 58,466-478(2004). I also attach
here my article (PNAS 99: 16134-16137) that may be
of some help to think about slight negative selection.

Dear Romina
Dear Evoldir members, Im performing a nucleotide
variability survey in a gene region of a Drosophila
species and I have several doubts about the interpre-
tation of the results of the McDonald-Kreitman test.
According to it, my sample has an excess of non syn-
onymous polymorphism and I found in the literature
three hypothesis to explain such result: changes in the
selective constraint of the gene,
recently strengthened would ﬁt your data
selection against deleterious mutations
I would add SLIGHTLY deleterious: selection weak
enough to detect polymorphism, but at a low frequency,
hardly ﬁxed
and episodic selection. My species also has an excess
of singletons in synonymous and non synonymous sites
that may be due to a recent population expansion, be-
cause this pattern is also present in other gene regions.
Can I say that this change in Ne is not responsible for
the departures in neutrality in MK because the pattern
is absent in other genes?
I ask because although the change in Ne should have
aﬀected all the genome in the same way, the relation-
ship between Ne and s (that determines the selective
constraint) could be diﬀerent for each gene.
Yes, this statement would assume that the distribution
of selection coeﬃcients is the same across genes (same
proportion of nearly neutral mutations that can become
eﬀectively neutral if there is a contraction of eﬀective
population size or become eﬀectively selected if there is
an expansion).
I also wonder how I can distinguish between selection
against deleterious mutations and episodic selection if
demography is aﬀecting the spectrum frequency.
With slightly deleterious mutations, you would expect
non synonymous polymorphisms to show a lower fre-
quency (on average or proportion of rare ones higher)
than synonymous ones . episodic selection can to my
view make any prediction about the freq spectrum and
is , to my view, hardly testable. Best, Frantz

problema que planteas, el cambio en Ne. Hay varios test
de neutralidad disponibles (personalmente, me gusta el
de Fu 1997). Basicamente, es diﬁcil dsitinguir entre un
efecto demograﬁco de seleccion para explicar desvios de

sibles a los efectos demograﬁcos (Fu 1997), otros mas
sensibles a seleccion (hay varios de estos tests imple-
mentados en el programa DNAsp, de Rozas y Rozas,
tiene Fu and Li test D, Fu 1996, Fu 1997). Realmente
la manera mas directa es ver otros genes. Los procesos

cDNA alignment
Below are the programs suggested by evoldir members
for aligning cDNA to genomic DNA. Sorry this didn’t
get posted earlier.WEB platforms:
Spidey from NCBI - this works great, but it does not
have a nice fasta ﬁle output with “-” ﬁlling in around
your cDNA as it is aligned to your genomic DNA. I
would really like to have that. But, it does have a
very nice graphical output and an exon table with %
match which can easily be copied into excel spread-
sheets. THere is also an executable form, but I have
not explored this. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/-
Research/Ostell/Spidey/ The Sim4 package appears to
be very popular, but runs on Unix/Linux, but there is
a web interface at http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/sim4.php
this output can be viewed by the program LalnView,
which has a nice graphical image, and is buggy if you
try and zoom, but other wise it is very nice (spidey
gives you just as much though). This program does
output in an alignment format, which is supposed to
be ClustalW, but I can’t get this converted into any
other format by programs that can read *.aln ﬁle for-
mats.
Est2genome is part of the EMBOSS package, and
a public server that will let you try this out is
here: http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/-
est2genome.html or the EMBOSS webpage itself
http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/-
index.html but the output does not have an aligned
cDNA with introns padded with “-”, but rather aligned
with truncated intron sequence. EST genome has the
same output as the EST2genome.
So, in sum, there are programs to predict your in-
tron/exon boundaries and Spidey does this well if you
are not unix savy. But as for getting a nice aligned out-
put where you can actually assess the genomic intron
sequence, along with your exons, one has to do this by
hand as far as I can tell. i did not check ESTwise
All the best and if someone knows of a program or
makes one, than can output the sequences in an aligned
format, like FASTA, with the cDNA padded with “-”
among its exons, please let me know.
Chris
Here is some more documentation and programs:
Sim4: “A Computer Program for Aligning a cDNA Se-
quence with a Genomic DNA Sequence” Liliana Florea,
George Hartzell, Zheng Zhang, Gerald M. Rubin, and
Webb Miller Genome Research Vol. 8, Issue 9, 967-974,
September 1998 If you don’t wish to install it on your
own machine (to my knowledge you’ll need a linux/unix
box), and if your data are not conﬁdential, then you
could try using this public web-based server (there are
probably others): http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/sim4.php
Alternatives: ’est genome’, written by Richard48 EvolDir November 2, 2004
Mott (and maintained by Peter Rice) and available
on the HGMP public http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/-
Registered/Option/est genome.html Probably estwise,
which is part of genewise (available from the Sanger
Center www.sanger.ebi.ac.uk ), does the job. Be
warned, it is slow. You need to keep in mind that to
achieve a correct alignment, you need to do the align-
ment on protein level, otherwise it does not work (as I
learned).
PC - there is an executable form of Spidey, but I have
not explored this.

LongDistanceDispersal
A post-doc position in theoretical population biology is
available in Norwich, England, to work on ’The Impact
of Long-Distance Dispersal on Population Genetics’.
The aims are to investigate the eﬀects of LDD on pop-
ulation structure, to study the interaction of LDD with50 EvolDir November 2, 2004
natural selection and to develop statistics to charac-
terise population genetic structure when there is LDD.
LDD is important in many biological situations and has
a close connection with complexity theory. This is an
excellent opportunity for a post-doc to apply current
developments in maths and physics to an important bio-
logical problem. This project is a collaboration between
me and Michael Shaw at the University of Reading.

UCanterbury EvolDiseaseResistance
UNIVERSITY OF CANTERBURY
School of Biological Sciences Christchurch, New
Zealand
We are seeking to appoint a Post-Doctoral Fellow
to conduct research on a two-year funded project on
“Emerging Infectious Diseases and Amphibian Popula-
tion Declines”.The Post-Doctoral Fellow will conduct research on dis-
eases that contribute to amphibian population declines,
immunological mechanisms that confer resistance to
these diseases, and the consequences of the virulence
of pathogens and host immunity on population viabil-
ity. The research will interface with projects currently
being conducted in our laboratory (1) on the role of the
MHC in encoding social behaviours and disease resis-
tance, (2) on the role of innate immunity in producing
antimicrobial peptides that confer disease resistance,
and (3) on genetic variability within and among popu-
lations of host species and their pathogens. One goal of
the project is to investigate the hypotheses that infec-
tivity and virulence decrease, or host immune defences
increase, under conditions in which pathogens and their
hosts have had an opportunity to co-evolve.
The research project takes an integrative, multidisci-
plinary approach and makes use of techniques of molec-
ular genetics, microbiology, and immunology.
The successful candidate will be a member of a large in-
teractive research group, and will have opportunities to
become involved in a variety of related student projects.
Experience in molecular biology, immunology, and/or
biochemistry with a strong interest in evolution is de-
sirable.

protocol, based on modern molecular PCR methods,
to determine the type and intensity of gastrointestinal
(GI) parasite infections in individual Seychelles war-
blers. This protocol will then be used, in conjunction
with the ﬁtness and MHC genotype data already avail-
able, to investigate the aﬀect of GI parasites and their
interaction with the MHC in the simple and isolated
system provided by the Seychelles warbler.
Applicants should hold, or be about to obtain, a PhD in
a relevant discipline such as evolutionary or molecular
ecology or parasitology. Practical experience in modern
molecular techniques such a PCR, primer development

DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY
Applications are invited from suitably qualiﬁed persons
for the position of Research Fellow in the Department
of Zoology. This position, in the laboratory of Profes-
sor Robert Poulin, is funded by the Marsden Fund and
is available for three years.
The appointee will have expertise in molecular ecology,
particularly with microsatellite markers; experience in
experimental parasitology, especially with trematodes,
would be an important asset but is not essential.
The research project aims to investigate the inﬂuence of
relatedness among parasites sharing the same host on
the parasites’ strategies of development and host ex-
ploitation. The research will involve three local trema-
tode species, parasitic in freshwater or intertidal ecosys-
tems, all amenable to both ﬁeld and laboratory in-
vestigations. The work involves (1) characterising mi-
crosatellite loci and genotyping individual parasites at
multiple loci to estimate levels of relatedness in ﬁeld-
infected hosts, and (2) in laboratory experiments, using
single- and multiple-genotype infections to quantify the
growth of parasites in their host, their ability to alter
host behaviour, and their likelihood to abbreviate their
life cycle.
Applicants must have completed a PhD and previous
scientiﬁc publications in a relevant ﬁeld. We wish to ﬁll
this position by February 2005 or soon thereafter.

Postdoc in Evolutionary Theory University of Ten-
nessee, Knoxville
I am looking for a postdoctoral researcher interested in
using mathematical models for studying one or more of
the following topics: speciation, adaptive radiation, co-
evolution, macroevolution, and cultural evolution. For
the ﬁrst three topics the emphasis will be on multilocus
genetics, spatial structure, and interactions of ecologi-
cal and evolutionary processes. An ideal candidate will
be using a combination of simple analytical models and
intensive numerical simulations and will be motivated
by biological questions and data. I expect to have fund-
ing for 2 years.
Send curriculum vitae, description of research interests
and experience, and names, addresses, phone numbers,
and e-mail of three references. Informal inquiries are
welcome.

UNIVERSITY OF WALES, BANGOR
SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
Postdoctoral Researcher in Molecular Ecology
R&A Grade 1A: £19,460 - £29,128 p.a. Applications
are invited for a Postdoctoral University-funded three-
year post in the School of Biological Sciences, Univer-
sity of Wales, Bangor ( http://biology.bangor.ac.uk/-
school/ ), working with Professor G. R. Carvalho andmembers of a newly established Group focusing on the
molecular ecology of aquatic animals and ﬁsheries ge-
netics. The appointee will join a team using molecular
markers to investigate the origins and signiﬁcance of
population and species biodiversity. In 2006 the Group
will transfer to the new Environment Centre whose re-
mit will be to provide a high-proﬁle hub for coordinat-
ing strategic research and training in the environmental
sciences sector in Wales. In addition to independent re-
search, the appointee will assist in the development of
the new Group including submission of research grant
applications and the management of projects and re-
search students.
Applicants should possess a PhD in molecular ecology
or associated areas, with some postdoctoral experience,
together with a strong commitment to timely publica-
tion and collaborative research. Although applications
are welcomed from those working in any area of molecu-
lar ecology, research interests and experience in environ-
mental genomics and/or quantitative genetics within an
evolutionary context are especially encouraged.
The appointee will join a thriving Evolutionary Ecology
Group, which in addition to a focus on the evolution
of population diﬀerentiation, detection of selection in
the wild, ﬁsheries genetics and analysis of ancient DNA
in aquatic animals, includes interests in the molecular
evolution of fragmented populations, the evolution of
marine mating systems, the molecular ecology of island
reptiles, behavioural ecology, molecular phylogeny of
venomous snakes and studies on the impacts of GMOs.
The School is well equipped with dedicated sequencing
facilities, many PCR blocks, microbiology and genomic
facilities etc.
Application forms and further particulars should be
obtained by contacting Human Resources, University

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
