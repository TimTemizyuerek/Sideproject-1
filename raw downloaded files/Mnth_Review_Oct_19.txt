What do maize, humans, chickens, tropical cattle and
Drosophila have in common? When it comes to quanti-
tative genetic analysis, more than you' ^Ad think. Which
is why the 6th International Conference of Quantita-
tive Genetics (ICQG6) will bring together researchers
in agriculture, human health, natural species and evolu-
tionary genetics from across the world, united by their
interest in understanding and translating the contri-
bution of genetic variation of quantitative traits. The
rapid technological advances of the last decade mean
that quantitative genetics approaches are relevant across
species whether in natural populations, model species,October 1, 2019 EvolDir 3
crops, livestock or humans. There has never been a
more exciting time to be a quantitative geneticist!
We have assembled a stellar line-up of internationally
renowned speakers https://icqg6.org/invited-speakers/-
, who will present and discuss state-of-the-art results,
theoretical developments and new methodologies rele-
vant across natural populations, model species, crops,
livestock and humans.
There will be plenty of opportunity for discussion and
networking. And if that' ^As not exciting enough, there
is the added bonus of Brisbane as your destination, a
city on the edge of the most extensive World Heritage
sub-tropical Gondwana rainforest in the world, and of
course the Great Barrier Reef just a short plane-hop
away.

Dear Colleagues,
We are looking for speakers to share their research in a
symposium entitled \Nutritional dimensions in insect
ecology and evolution", taking place at the XXVI In-
ternational Congress of Entomology from July 19-24,
2020, in Helsinki, Finland (https://ice2020helsinki./).
We specically encourage graduate students in ento-
mology and/or microbiology to submit an abstract for
consideration.
The main goal of the session is to bring together
symbiont- and host-encoded contributions to insect nu-
trition and discuss their evolutionary history and eco-
logical consequences. We aim to showcase research at
the forefront of a eld that is redening insect biology
by the widespread application of genetic and genomic
approaches. By including both microbial and host per-
spectives, this symposium will bridge schools of thought
across subelds and enable us to apply multidisciplinary
approaches for a more balanced overview of insect nu-
trition.

Helsinki InsectEvolution Jul19-24
We would like to invite submissions to our symposium
held during the International Congress of Entomology
(ICE 2020) from July 19th - 24th, 2020 in Helsinki, Fin-
land, entitled, *Exploiting host-location behaviors and
host-plant resistance to manage invasive woodborers.*
International trade has increased the rate at which wood-
boring insects are being introduced into novel habitats.
The lack of coevolutionary history with potential host
plants, and escape from natural enemies has caused
these non-native insects to become ecological and eco-
nomic threats in their new ranges. Identifying patterns
in host-location behaviors by woodborers and their nat-
ural enemies, as well as within mechanisms of resistance
by these plants to attackers, can lead to management
practices that reduce the success of colonization and
increase mortality of woodborers in novel habitats.
The goal of this symposium is to spur discussion re-
garding the theory and application of maintaining ro-
bust populations of trees that are resistant to attack by
woodboring beetles. This task requires crosstalk among
researchers that study host location by woodborers and
their natural enemies, as well as those that study plant
defense, ultimately leading to the selection of popula-
tions of trees that minimize damage and reduce the
likelihood of outbreaks of woodboring beetles. We are
looking for researchers that are currently conducting
research in these topic areas to present and provide
further insights.
*Topics of interest include*:
-Theoretical or synthetic presentations on: plant defense
against woodboring insects and host-location by natural
enemies
-Host selection cues used by woodborers and their natu-
ral enemies, including but not limited to: cues that are
chemical, visual, and tactile6 EvolDir October 1, 2019
-Mechanisms of resistance used by host trees: antibiosis,
antixenosis, and/or tolerance
-Patterns in coevolved resistant traits and lack of those
mechanisms in novel hosts

21stYOUNG SYSTEMATISTS??? FORUM Friday
22nd November 2019, 9:30 am Venue: Flett Lecture
Theatre, Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists??? Forum represents
an exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration isFREE. Please register here https:/-
/www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/21st-young-systematists-
forum-tickets-71381037605 supplying your name,
contact address and stating whether or not you
wish to give an oral or poster presentation.Please
also tell us your academic stage ??? e.g., Mas-
ters, PhD or postdoc.Send abstracts by e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com ,
Space will be allocated subject to availability and for a
balanced programme of animal, plant, algal, microbial,
molecular and other research. Non-presenting attendees
are also very welcome - please register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English and in
Word format no later than Friday 25 October 2019. The
body text should not exceed 150 words in length. Ti-
tle, authors, and their professional aliations/addresses
should be included with the abstracts.If the presentation10 EvolDir October 1, 2019
is co-authored, the actual speaker (oral) or presenter
(poster) must be clearly indicated in BOLD text. The
le should be in editable format (.doc or .odt, not pdf)
and titled Surname First-name YSF2019.doc, for exam-
ple Doe Jane YSF2019.doc.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

Registration
Dear all,
We would like to share again with you an announcement
of the upcoming Experimental Evolution workshop that
we are organizing in Vienna this year.
!!!!! Registration deadline is the *30th of September,
2019*. !!!!!
The Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics
is now accepting applications for the course *\Experi-
mental evolution: bringing theory and practice together"
*at the University of Veterinary Medicine in *Vienna,*
*December 2-6, 2019*.
Experimental evolution is extensively used to address
questions of evolutionary biology by exposing evolv-
ing populations to dierent environmental conditions.
It oers the opportunity to replicate experiments and
test for convergent outcomes. With the recent drop in
DNA sequencing cost and the advance of sequencing
technologies, the combination of experimental evolution
with next generation sequencing of pools of individuals
(Evolve & Resequence) has become a state-of-the-art
method to link phenotypic responses to genetic changes.
Although the availability of replicated time series data
is one key advantage of E&R, the analysis of such data
sets is still in its infancy. This course will introduce the
participants to several new approaches for the analysisof genomic time series data covering the latest software
tools as well as required statistical and computational
skills.
The course is targeted towards researchers interested
in experimental evolution combined with NGS and will
cover the design of experimental evolution studies as
well as the analysis of Pool-Seq time series data.
The course aims to introduce participants to: - State-
of-the-art software packages - Modeling of neutral data
- Identifying selected regions - Comparison of n-point
analysis with time series data - Haplotypes reconstruc-
tion from time-series data - Inferring linkage structure of
Pool-Seq data - Estimating selection coecients - Call-
ing transposable elements in time series data - Inferring
selection in transcriptomics data
Morning lectures by internationally renowned faculty
will be followed by computer practicals on the analysis
of experimental evolution data in the afternoon.

BielefeldU
MadagascarBirdEvolution
3 year PhD studentship available: Bielefeld University
(Germany) and University of Bath (UK).
With Prof Oliver Kruger, Dr Nayden Chakarov, Prof
Joe Homan and Prof Tamas Szekely.
Mating systems and parental behaviour are among the
most diverse social behaviours, and recent research sug-
gests that the social environment inuences these be-
haviours. Small plovers (Charadrius spp.) exhibit highly
variable breeding systems, between and within species,
making them an ideal model system for studying the
causes and consequences of sex ratio variation. The
objective of this studentship is to investigate these fun-
damental issues by means of eldwork in three plover
populations in Madagascar. The research builds on the
results from previous successful studentships working
with these birds.
We seek a bright and highly motivated student with a
keen interest in evolutionary ecology and behavioural
ecology. Willingness to carry out eldwork in a challeng-
ing tropical environment is essential for this position.The student will search for nests, trap birds and collect
blood and other samples and record plover behaviour.
In addition, they will use molecular methods in the
laboratory for sexing and the genetic analysis of host-
associated parasite communities. Previous experience
of avian eld biology or any other eld experience in
the tropics is very important, while experience of popu-
lation genetic approaches and/or parasitology would be
benecial.
Fieldwork will be in a remote and pristine location in
SW Madagascar. Facilities are extremely basic, the
weather can be very harsh, and a great deal of walking
and cycling are required. Opportunities for communica-
tion with the outside world are very limited. You must
be physically t, hard-working and meticulous, and have
a proven ability to work independently. You must have
a positive attitude and an ability to look after yourself
(i.e. cook your own meals, deal with logistics and or-
ganise your own work over extended periods). Speaking
French is advantageous, but is not a requirement.
The overall aim of the project is to study the immuno-
ecological causes of sex ratio bias in three sympatric
species of plovers with varying mating systems at a sin-
gle location in Madagascar. At which stage of the life
cycle and how do mortality dierences between the sexes
emerge, and what are the demographic consequences of
these dierences? We aim to experimentally manipu-
late parasite infections in plovers but also to monitor
populations closely to identify the proximate causes of
previously described adult sex ratio biases. In addi-
tion, the student will test hypotheses relating to mating
system evolution, and develop demographic models to
estimate key demographic properties of natural pop-
ulations. Experience of statistical modelling and/or
parasitological/immunological techniques is therefore
advantageous and more generally, strong quantitative
skills are highly desirable.

Denmark. DTU Aqua is an institute at the Technical
University of Denmark.
The population genetics group applies molecular meth-
ods with the aim to gain knowledge on how to preserve
and manage biodiversity sustainably, in relation to recre-
ational and commercial sheries, biodiversity conserva-
tion and aquaculture. Knowledge is achieved through
research into the evolutionary processes responsible for
generating and maintaining genetic diversity within and
among populations of marine and freshwater sh and
shellshOctober 1, 2019 EvolDir 21
The project: Sustainable management, harvest and pro-
duction of marine sh and shellsh resources require
fundamental knowledge about the demography, distri-
bution and connectivity of natural populations. The
native European at oyster (Ostrea edulis) is a sought-
after food source commonly considered a luxury good.
European at oyster has received increased biodiversity
conservation attention because native populations have
declined due to overshing and disease outbreaks. At
the same time, the species is regarded as commercially
valuable within its native range in northern Europe and
has therefore attracted increased focus on development
in aquaculture.
In this project, we focus on Scandinavian oyster pop-
ulations that have so far received relatively limited at-
tention. These populations are found within important
environmental gradients and are close to the distribu-
tional margins of the species, which makes them inter-
esting targets for analyses of population and, ultimately,
aquaculture genomics. We have two overarching aims
in the project:
(1) Increase our understanding of the distribution of
natural genetic diversity. We will investigate when and
how European at oyster colonized Scandinavian coastal
regions as well as the relationship and connectivity be-
tween populations.
Our approach here will be to use genome data (reduced
representation or genome sequencing) from wild popu-
lations to model demographic history and investigate
genetic structure, signatures of selection and connec-
tivity among populations. We aim to link analyses to
demographic and oceanographic data as well as habitat
modelling.
(2) Develop genetics as a practical tool for European
at oyster aquaculture and restoration programmes, for
example to monitor genetic diversity in aquaculture pop-
ulations, identify brood-stocks and source populations
for use in restoration programmes and breeding aimed
at increasing disease resistance.
In (2) our approach will be to use a combination of
population genomics data from (1) to identify source
populations and new data for parentage analyses of
aquaculture populations. Literature will be mined for
disease resistance genes/genomic regions that can be
assayed in wild/aquaculture populations.
Qualications: Candidates should have a two-year mas-
ter's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with
an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's
degree.
A background in population genetics is preferred and
experience with bioinformatic analyses of large ge-netic/genomic data sets is an asset.
In addition, we are looking for candidates who have -
Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Biology, Computer
Science or Engineering - Strong analytical skills/interest
- Keen interest in research and the eld of marine and
aquatic sciences - Good collaborative skills - Prociency
in written and spoken English
Salary and appointment terms: The appointment will be
based on the collective agreement with the Danish Con-
federation of Professional Associations; starting salary
is around 3400 EUR per month + pension savings. The
period of employment is 3 years.

PhD-position on the eects of the environment on pace
of life and microbiome of bank voles
We are seeking a highly motivated student for a PhD-
position based at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow
(Poland) and the University of Jyv askyl a (Finland). The
student will join the project \The role of environmental
factors in maintaining adaptive pace-of-life variation
in a mammal holobiont: an experimental evolution ap-
proach."
Our aim is to investigate how environmental conditions
that animals experience at dierent times in life inuence
tness. An animal and its microbiome (the community
of commensal microbes inhabiting the gut) coevolve
and should respond to the environment as a unit. The
microbiome can, therefore, be very important in help-
ing individual animals cope with the environment they
develop and live in. To test this idea, we will study the
eects of environmental manipulations on the life his-
tory and physiology of animals and associated changes
in its gut microbiome. We will test hypotheses about
the role of the microbiome in inuencing the tness of
the animal host through lab and eld experiments with
established bank vole (Myodes glareolus) selection lines.
The student will have an opportunity to conduct ex-
periments with captive voles in Krakow and participate
in eld experiments conducted in large eld enclosures
in central Finland. The project oers opportunities to
learn state-of-the-art methods and a range of transfer-
able skills, including physiological measurements, lab
work such as DNA extractions, genomic analyses of the
gut microbiome and the associated bioinformatics and
statistical analyses. The student will collect and analyse
data and prepare publications in close collaboration with
an international team of researchers at the Jagiellonian
University, Poland (Dr Anni H am al ainen, Prof Pawel
Koteja) and the University of Jyv askyl a, Finland (Prof
Phillip Watts, Dr Tapio Mappes, Dr Esa Koskela).
The successful candidate will have an MSc degree in a rel-
evant eld; evidence of good quantitative/computational
skills; and strong English language, communication,
organizational and collaboration skills. Previous ex-
perience with small mammals, microbial communities,
bioinformatics, animal physiology and/or evolutionarybiology are considered advantageous.
The prospective student receives a stipend (4500
PLN/month, excellent standard relative to the low liv-
ing costs in Krakow) from the National Science Centre
grant for 3 years, and a supplement to attend confer-
ences and travel for eld work. Additional funding may
be available e.g. through a graduate school.

PhD positions in the Hochberg group in Evolutionary
Biochemistry
The Hochberg lab is a new free oater group at the
Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in
Marburg and aliated with the Chemistry Department
of Marburg University. The group studies the evolution
of protein complexes at the interface between physical
biochemistry and evolutionary biology.
We are looking for highly self-motivated PhD students
who are willing to tackle an interdisciplinary research
program and join our group on fully funded positions to
start as early as November 2019. For a description of the
research we do please read below and visit our website:October 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
https://www.mpi-marburg.mpg.de/hochberg The ma-
jority of proteins associate into higher-order complexes.
They range from the simple - containing only a few ge-
netically identical subunits - to the baroquely elaborate
- containing dozens of genetically dierent subunits in
precise arrangements. How and why complexes evolve
and change in evolutionary history is largely unknown,
but directly relates to major questions in evolutionary
biology: Does biological complexity arise through many
incremental steps, or through rare but drastic jumps?
And is it always driven by natural selection for some
benecial function, or does blind chance play a role in
creating and maintaining this complexity? Our group
uses ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect an-
cient complexes that last existed hundreds of millions
of years ago. By experimentally characterizing these
ancient proteins using state-of-the-art mass spectrom-
etry and high-throughput techniques, we will unravel
the interplay of history, chance, and natural selection
in producing the complexity that exists today.
Experience in biochemistry is not necessary, though
basic skills are an advantage anda sincere interest and
desire to learn are indispensible. Experience in phy-
logenetics is welcome. Possible projects include char-
acterizing the complete set of interactions among all
extant and ancestral members of a protein family to
understand how and why interactions change over time;
experimentally quantifying the rate at which random
chance events produced stable protein complexes in
evolutionary history; and investigating to what degree
increases in the complexity of protein assemblies are
reversible in evolutionary history.
This is a rare chance for young scientists to participate
in shaping the research program of an emerging group.
You will join a thriving scientic community at one of
Germany's famous Max Planck Institutes. Marburg it-

Graduate positions in plant ecological and evolutionary
genetics/genomics at Purdue University.
The Oakley lab at Purdue University (https://-
btny.purdue.edu/labs/oakley/) is looking to recruit 1-2
graduate (PhD or MS) students for Fall 2020.
Our lab is broadly interested in questions related to
plant ecological genetic. Based on current research
strengths in the lab there are two potential topics for
PhD projects. 1) The genetic basis of local adapta-
tion and adaptive traits, and 2) Using heterosis and
inbreeding depression as tools to investigate the balance
between mutation, drift, and selection in natural popu-
lations. Both projects could include some combination
of eld and growth chamber/greenhouse experiments
with wet lab and -omic approaches in our well-developed
system of natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. I
am also open to discussing projects using these and other
approaches in other well-established systems. Gradu-
ate courses oered by members of the Purdue Center
for Plant Biology (https://ag.purdue.edu/cpb/faculty/)
will help to provide training in developing the interdis-
ciplinary skillset needed to address these big questions
in evolutionary biology.
I am also interested in recruiting a highly motivated MS
student interested in plant mating system evolution, par-28 EvolDir October 1, 2019
ticularly the ecological and genetic factors maintaining
outcrossing in highly selng species.
PhD and MS students can apply to the Department of
Botany and Plant Pathology (https://ag.purdue.edu/-
btny/Pages/default.aspx). PhD students also have the
option of applying to the Interdisciplinary Program in
Plant Biology (https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/-
pulse/groups/plant-biology.html). Please contact me
prior to applying to discuss which option might be
best for you. These positions will be funded (including
stipend, health insurance, and tuition waiver) by some
combination of research and teaching assistantships.
Some internal fellowships are available for applications
submitted before Nov. 15.
To inquire about graduate research in my lab please
contact me by email (oakleyc@purdue.edu). Please in-
clude a copy of your CV and a brief description of your
research interests and experience, and how these inter-
ests/experience ts with current research in the lab.

ries and have an amazing diversity of hind leg shapes.
Ongoing projects in the lab include studies of trade-os
between weapons and testes; the eect of nutrition and
social environments on weapon structure, testes size,
and male ghting behavior; and the role of phenotypic
plasticity in the processes of invasion. We are currently
reconstructing a phylogeny of the Coreidae to next test
hypotheses of weapon shape evolution.
Successful applicant for this position will have previ-
ous research experience and coursework in the elds
of ecology, evolution, and/or animal behavior. Most
students conduct at least one experimental lab-based
project, followed by additional local and/or interna-

GenomicsAdaptiveDierentiation
PhD position in biology, Institute of Life and Envi-
ronmental Sciences, University of Iceland A full PhD
position in biology is open for applications, at the Insti-
tute of Life and Environmental Sciences for the project:
The genomic basis of adaptive dierentiation between
closely related morphs of Arctic charr
To what extent do loci with moderate to large eects
on phenotype contribute to adaptive dierentiation be-
tween ecotypes of Arctic charr specialising on foraging
for dierent prey types in dierent environments within
Thingvallavatn? Are loci related to adaptive dierentia-
tion xed, or do they cause variation both between and
within morphs? Are there evidence of positive selection
in the genome? Do genomic regions with signatures
of selection also associate with phenotype? These andrelated questions will be addressed by a team of re-
searchers, and a capable Ph.D. student responding to
this advertisement. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)
of Lake Thingvallavatn are ideally suited for studies of
the ecology and genetics of adaptive diversication: i) it
is an extraordinarily well-characterised system, ii) it has
young evolutionary history, iii) it has diverged into four
morphs with distinct variation in life history character-
istics, behaviour and trophic morphology, suggesting
rapid adaptive diversication. This system thus repre-
sents an extremely compelling case of rapid adaptive
dierentiation. However, to date, the system has been
under-used to answer fundamental questions about the
genetic basis of this diversication, due in large part to
a lag in the development of genomic resources, and the
long generation time. These issues have recently been
overcome, and it is now possible to get at some long-
outstanding questions. The overall aim of this project is
to answer fundamental questions about the genetic basis
of this extraordinary case of rapid adaptive dierentia-
tion, by determining the number, genomic distribution,
range of eect sizes on traits and evidence of selection
of loci contributing to adaptive diversication. We will
answer these questions by deploying a series of studies,
using both classical genetic study designs (QTL map-
ping) of carefully constructed laboratory crosses, and
modern population genomic analyses of eld-collected
specimens.
We are seeking a student with dedication, drive and good
theoretical background in evolution, ecology, population
genomics and quantitative genetics. The position will
be at the University of Iceland. The project is in collab-
oration with Michael B. Morrissey at the university of
St Andrews, Scotland and Moira M Ferguson at the uni-
versity of Guelph (Canada). The work will be divided
between the universities of Iceland, St. Andrews and
Guelph. The PhD study should be completed within

involved in teaching, for two semesters maximum.

months, funded)
The University of Oulu is one of the largest universities
in Finland. It is an international scientic community,
with 14,000 students and approximately 3,000 employ-
ees. The strengths of the University are wide multidis-
ciplinary study/research interests and modern research
and study environment, as well as good cooperation
with international educational and research institutes.
More information: http://www.oulu./english/ . We
are now looking for a doctoral student to join the Ecol-
ogy and Genetics Research Unit at the University of
Oulu.
Project description Documenting general patterns of
genetic diversication across large geographic areas is
essential to understand evolutionary processes and can
also aid conservation eorts aiming to preserve genetic
diversity. However, obtaining massive DNA data sets for
speciose taxonomic groups at large spatial scales is ex-
tremely challenging. The current project will be the rst
to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of genetic dier-
entiation at a continental-scale for an entire, diverse tax-
onomic group. We will use an unparalleled genetic data
set of over 22,000 cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI)
sequences covering 95% of the ca. 520 European and
North African buttery species (Lepidoptera). This data
set will allow the inference of paradigms in phylogeog-
raphy and the assessment of continental-scale patterns
of genetic diversity and endemism. Next-generation se-
quencing (ddRAD-sequencing) will also be used with
selected taxa to determine whether results inferred with
mitochondrial DNA are also reected in the nuclear
genome. The research will be conducted with extensive
national and international collaboration. The project is
nanced by the Academy of Finland. The Principal In-
vestigator (PI) of the project is Vlad Dinca (University
of Oulu, Finland).
Duties The doctoral student will participate in 3-4 sep-
arate research studies. She/he will participate and is
expected to gain good skills in laboratory analyses, data
analyses, bioinformatics, scientic writing and eld work.40 EvolDir October 1, 2019
She/he will be a leading author in at least two research
papers and will be supervised by the project PI and
other senior core team members. The doctoral student
will have the possibility to develop professionally with
the help of an experienced and enthusiastic team, using
modern scientic methods and high-quality data.
Qualication and selection criteria The doctoral student
must reach the MSc degree in biology (or similar) be-
fore the start of the contract. She/he is expected to be
highly motivated and committed to nish her/his PhD
studies during the funding period. Good English com-
munication skills (writing and speaking) are mandatory.
Previous experience and interest in genomic methods,
bioinformatics and/or statistics, as well as working with
insects, are considered as an advantage.
Duration and terms of employment The doctoral stu-
dent will start earliest on 1st of November 2019 and
not later than 1st of January 2020. The duration of
employment is 48 months. The salary will be based on
the levels 2-4 of the demand level chart for teaching
and research sta of Finnish universities. In addition, a
salary component based on personal work performance
will be paid (maximum of 50 % of the job-specic com-
ponent). The gross salary will be about 2,300-2,500
euro/month. A six-month trial period is applied in the
beginning of employment. Health care is provided by
the employer.

UTexasAM SpeciationHybridZones
The Delmore Lab at the University of Texas A&M is
looking for PhD students to join our group. We study
speciation using hybrid zones and work at both the
micro and macroevolutionary scale. One of our research
streams focuses on speciation genomics and includes
work on the processes that generation genome-wide
variation in estimates of dierentiation. We use both
genomic data and computer simulations to address this
question.
Another research stream focuses on behaviour 'V howvariation in behavioural traits contributes to speciation
and the molecular basis of these traits. One of the
behaviours we study is seasonal migration. Much of
this work focuses on a hybrid zones between Swain-
son'^As thrushes but we are constantly expanding the
scope of this work. Another behaviour we study is
courtship behaviour using a hybrid zone between ruby-
thorated/black-chinned hummingbirds.

bill dimorphism (trade-os between ghting and nectar
extraction abilities), and more generally in the evolution
of intrasexually selected weapons across animals.
4) Deciphering the causal mechanisms for social dom-
inance and intra- plus inter-specic competition out-
comes, and how variation in behavioral strategies (e.g.,
interference vs. exploitative competition) maximizes net
energy gain.
5) Performing comparative studies along gradients from
trait development (e.g. weapons achieved only until
adulthood) and interindividual variation (e.g. polymor-
phisms), to parallel (e.g. independent appearances of
weapons in hummingbirds) and convergent (e.g. in other
nectar-feeding birds) evolution.
6) Quantifying the physiological and biomechanical
trade-os among hummingbird feeding, breathing, and
locomotion, that constrain the highest mass-specic
metabolic rates in vertebrates.

InsectSymbioses
I am currently seeking two graduate students to start
in the fall 2020 to study insect-microbial symbioses.
Research in my newly established lab focuses on the
evolution of insect-microbial symbioses. Parasitic lice
(Phthiraptera) and their symbiotic microbes (Ca. Riesia
species, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/53872)
serve as the primary focus of my research. CurrentlyI am investigating how microbial symbioses facilitates
the evolution of novel insect phenotypes, how symbioses
impacts genome evolution in bacteria, and the roles mo-
bile genetic elements play in insect-microbial symbioses.
Students working in the lab will gain experience in bioin-
formatics and wet lab techniques. An emphasis will be
placed on bioinformatics and students will gain experi-
ence with phylogenetic methods, genome/transcriptome
assembly, genome annotation and comparison, and
metagenome analysis. You can learn more about my
work by visiting rampages.us/bboydlab/

WageningenU PlacentaEvolution
Evolution of Maternal Eects in Placental Fishes
Job description A 4-year PhD position (1.0 FTE) is
available in the lab of Dr. Bart Pollux in the Experi-
mental Zoology group at Wageningen University, the
Netherlands. The aim of this project is to study the
mechanisms that underlie maternal eects on developing
ospring during pregnancy, and how these change in
livebearing animal lineages during the evolution of a
placenta.
The placenta is an intimate maternal-fetal connection
that plays a crucial role in the regulation of embryo
development. The evolution of such an intimate connec-
tion implies that stressful conditions experienced by the
mother during pregnancy can more easily be transmitted
to the embryo via the placenta. The project will study
how the mechanisms, by which adverse environments
experienced by the mother (e.g. nutritional stress or the
perception of predation risk) are transmitted to theirOctober 1, 2019 EvolDir 45
developing ospring, change during the evolution of a
placenta.
We will study this by comparing live-bearing sh species
(family Poeciliidae) with and without placentas. This
family contains closely-related species, as well as popula-
tions within species, that vary markedly in the presence
and/or complexity of placentas. This variation oers
a unique opportunity to study how maternal eects
evolve in association with the evolution of the placenta.
Depending on the applicant's interest, the project can in-
clude a combination of eldwork (Costa Rica, Surinam),
common garden breeding experiments, anatomical and
functional studies of placenta & brain, physiological
& cognitive performance studies, and comparative ge-
nomics & transcriptomics.
Requirements For this interdisciplinary project, we look
for an enthusiastic, creative, result-driven person with
an MSc degree (obligated) in biology or related eld. Ap-
plicants should have a genuine interest in evolutionary
biology - in particular the relationship between ecology,
development and evolution. Research experience in the
relevant domains (MSc thesis) is required and excellent
communication skills and prociency in English (both
oral and written) are a prerequisite.
Additional information For further information, please
contact Dr. Bart Pollux (Assistant Professor Evolu-
tionary Biology; email: bart.pollux@wur.nl; phone:
+31.6.317.486083; website: www.bartpollux.nl). The
application deadline is Monday 30 September 2019. The
preferred starting date is as soon as possible. Applica-
tions should include a letter of motivation, a detailed
CV and names of three references.
Please send all application materials directly to

MicrobiomeEvolution
*Assistant Professorships in Microbiome Research*
The Departments of Molecular Biology and Biochem-
istry(MBB) and of Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy(EEB) at the University of California, Irvine, invite
applications for two tenure-track assistant professorships
in microbiome research.
*Host-microbiome interactions*.The additive and syn-
ergistic factors inuencing the host environment have
important consequences for human health and disease.
Our goal is to hire a researcher who is not focused on
a particular disease, but rather investigates how to dis-
entangle host-microbiome interactions broadly acrossdiseases or animal hosts. Potential research areas for
the position include (but are not limited to) investi-
gating how the microbiome mediates host responses to
pathogen infection, chemical challenge or injury, alter-
ing host metabolism or inuencing host development
or homeostasis. The home department of this faculty
member would be in the MBB department, with the
possibility of an additional appointment in EEB.
*Evolution of microbiomes. *Microbes adapt rapidly,
even over several days. Microbial evolution within a
community context is therefore key to understanding
how microbiomes respond to disturbance. Within hu-
mans or other hosts, a disturbance might be a change
in diet, disease progression, or administration of a treat-
ment or probiotic. In the environment, disturbances can
include environmental changes in nutrients and climate
driven by anthropogenic activities. Potential research
areas for the position include (but are not limited to)
the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a community
context, the evolution of microbiomes in response to
global change, the evolution of drug metabolism, host-
microbiome coevolution, or the comparative evolution
of microbiomes across hosts.The home department of
this researcher would be in EEB, with the possibility of
an additional appointment in MBB.
The successful candidate is expected to develop an in-
dependent, externally funded research program leading
to innovations in microbiome research. Building syn-
ergistic connections with existing research programs is
encouraged. The candidate will also contribute to teach-
ing and mentoring at the graduate and undergraduate
levels and to university and professional service.
The researchers would join an actively growing and
collaborative group of campus faculty studying the mi-
crobiomes of hosts and the environment, organized and
facilitated by the UCI Microbiome Initiative. EEB and
MBB are part of the School of Biological Sciences, a
vibrant community of scholars comprised of over 120 fac-
ulty members including Fellows of the National Academy
of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
and the Royal Society. Biological Sciences at UCI is
highly interdisciplinary with many connections to the
Schools of Medicine, Physical Sciences, Information and
Computer Sciences, and Engineering, among others.
UCI is a Minority Serving Institution (MSI), designated
as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and as an Asian
American and Native American Pacic Islander-Serving
Institution (AANAPISI). These federal designations
align with UCI's aspiration to be a national leader and
global model of inclusive excellence. UCI is a top ten
public research university that excels at improving out-
comes for students from economically disadvantaged72 EvolDir October 1, 2019
backgrounds and as a consequence has consistently been
ranked as the best university in the nation in promoting
upward mobility of its graduates.
Review of applications will begin November 1, 2019 with
applications and will remain open until the position is
lled.

Molecular Biology and Biochemistry's tenure-track as-
sistant professorship in microbiome research, please go

As part of a continuing campaign to grow and enhance
the Department of Biology at the University of Ken-
tucky (http://bio.as.uky.edu/) in Lexington, Kentucky,
we seek to hire two tenure-track Assistant Professors in
any area of Integrative Biology.
The Department of Biology has developed strengths in
evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, development
and regeneration, and biological clocks, and uses a di-
verse array of model systems (e.g., Drosophila, lampreys,
zebrash, birds, salamanders, a variety of mammals,
microbes, and plants). Our current eort to enhance
our research portfolio includes building strength in the
following areas: (1) biological timing systems and (2)
responses to environmental change. For example, fac-
ulty hired recently in these areas study interactions of
energy balance and circadian clocks, and the evolution
of host-pathogen interactions. However, we are inter-
ested in any exciting area of Biology that enhances or
complements facets of our departmental research. Re-
search in the Department uses empirical, computational,
and theoretical perspectives, and we invite prospective
research programs that use any combination of these
approaches.
With more than 500 life sciences faculty on one con-
tiguous campus, there are excellent opportunities for
scientic interaction and collaboration with programs
in the Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering,
Agriculture, and Arts & Sciences, the Markey Cancer
Center, the Sanders Brown Center on Aging, and the
Center for Clinical and Translational Science, among
others. Applicants for both positions must have a Ph.D.October 1, 2019 EvolDir 75
or equivalent degree with postdoctoral experience (min-
imum 6 months) demonstrating excellence in their eld.

port and/or some teaching experience is encouraged.
Responsibilities for the successful candidates include (1)
establishment of an independent research program that
is supported by awards from extramural agencies; (2)
contribution to the teaching mission of the undergradu-
ate program; (3) teaching and mentoring for graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows; and (4) service for
the department, university, and profession. Competitive
start-up funds and renovated laboratory space will be
provided.
Applicants should submit the following: 1) a cover let-
ter, 2) curriculum vitae, 3) two-page description of the

statement of contributions to diversity and inclusion
(upload under Specic Request 3). Also provide the
names and contact information for three references when
prompted in the application. This information will be
utilized to solicit recommendation letters from your
references within the employment system. Questions
about the Department and/or these searches should
be addressed to Dr. Vincent Cassone, Chair, Depart-
ment of Biology, University of Kentucky, 101D Thomas

State University's Biocollections and Biodiversity
Knowledge Integration Center are, as of late-2018,
home to National Ecological Observatory Network
(NEON) Biorepository. We encourage potential
applicants to the NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Biology (PRFB) to consider including the unique
biological samples at the NEON Biorepository in
their proposals. We are open to considering a wide
range of forms of engagement with NEON samples for
proposal development, both on- and o-site. PRFB
areas 1, 2, and 4 can all potentially align with this
opportunity; with area (2) \Interdisciplinary Research
Using Biological Collections" being a particularly
unique match.
NEON Biorepository samples are directly tied to the
research design and purpose of the NEON project, i.e.,
to facilitate long-term monitoring/forecasting of eco-
logical and evolutionary processes on a continental
scale. Therefore, the available specimens are repre-
sentative of populations and communities in the eld
and associated with high-resolution environmental and
organismal data. Samples received to date are ap-
propriate for answering a wide variety of scientic
questions related to community/population/phylo- ge-
netics, population/community structure, microbiomes,
disease/microbial/ecosystem/macro- ecology, etc.
The NEON Biorepository currently consists of more
than 88,000 biological and environmental samples. Sam-
ples are collected from all 81 NEON terrestrial andfreshwater aquatic sites located across the continental
US, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The Biorepository is
growing at a rate >100,000 samples/year of more than
60 classes representing a variety of taxonomic groups.
In addition to whole organism voucher specimens, the
Biorepository archives a variety of less conventional
samples, including genomic, microbial, blood, fecal, leaf
litter, soil, and bulk community-level samples.
A partial list of sample classes can be found on the
NEON website here: https://www.neonscience.org/-
data/archival-samples-specimens/archival-samples-

ThermalAdaptation Issue
Call for contributions to the Research Topic ^ awith Cli-
mate Change: A genomic perspective on Thermal Adap-
tation'
Margarida Matos, Pedro Simoes, Ines Fragata, Ana

preparing an article collection titled ^ awith Climate
Change: A Genomic Perspective on Thermal Adapta-
tion' (fro.ntiers.in \9TVy) as a Research Topic in Fron-
tiers in Genetics section Evolutionary and Population
Genetics.
The goal of this Research Topic is to bring together
studies on thermal biology using genomic approaches.
By doing this we aim to contribute to a better under-
standing of the genomic basis of thermal adaptation
pinpointing if and how dierent species and populationsOctober 1, 2019 EvolDir 91
cope with challenges in the face of climate change.
We welcome dierent article types addressing, but not
limited to the following questions: - Do populations
present enough genetic variability to cope with climate
change via evolutionary changes? - Is (genomic) evo-
lutionary potential to adapt to climate changes more
limited in some species or populations than others? -
What are the genomic dierences between populations
that adapt to contrasting temporal thermal patterns? -
How much do populations dier in the genetic pathways
that underly thermal adaptation? - Are there common
genes underlying thermal adaptation? What is their
variation across species? - What is the genetic basis of
plastic thermal responses? - What is the relative role of
regulation of gene expression versus evolutionary genetic
changes in how populations respond to climate change?
- What is the impact of temperature on microbiome-host
evolution?
Submissions of abstracts (in the Topic webpage -
fro.ntiers.in \9TVy) are open until 15th of September
2019. Manuscript submission deadline is the 28th of
February 2020.
Please feel free tocontact Margarida Matos (mm-
matos@fc.ul.pt) for any doubts. The abstract is not
mandatory but we would appreciate that you communi-
cate your interest as soon as possible!
We would alsomuch appreciate if you could help dissem-
inate this initiative.

Grants for ArcticResearch
Dear All,
Just a short note that the EU-funded INTERACT net-
work (https://eu-interact.org) has a call for Transna-
tional Access visitation grants that cover travel and
housing costs at 43 research stations located across theArctic. The call description is available at https://eu-
interact.org/accessing-the-arctic/tacall, and the dead-
line for applications is October 8, 2019.
In this context it is worth mentioning that the NIBIO
Svanhovd research station in northern Norway oers
possibilities for conducting eld work in diverse sub-
arctic and arctic aquatic and terrestrial environments.
Unlike most eld stations, Svanhovd also has a modern
molecular genetics lab that can be used during visits.
Also note that Remote Access funding can be used to
cover eld work done by the station's technical sta.
Svanhovd's website is currently under construction, but
some information on facilities and the local environment
is already available at www.svanhovd-molecol.no .

Rad-Seqvs Tag-Seq
Hello all,
My name is Lucia and I am a Biology PhD student from
University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. For my thesis I
am exploring the changes the bacteria Wolbachia pip-
ientis induces in the weevil Pantomorus postfasciatus
in order to make infected females parthenogenetic. We
know there is a bacterial density threshold necessary to
cause such a radical change in the weevil's reproductive
system and one of my objectives is to identify dier-
entially expressed genes in ovarian tissue from sexual
females, infected females and \cured" females (females
treated with antibiotics to reduce the bacterial density
below the threshold) in order to shed some light on how
Wolbachia aects the reproductive system of infected
weevils.
Two paths lay ahead of me: standard RNASeq or
TagSeq. From what I have been reading, TagSeq
is a low-cost but still reliable alternative (Meyer et.
al., 2011'Vdoi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05205.x'V;92 EvolDir October 1, 2019
Lohman et. al., 2016'Vdoi: 10.1111/1755-0998.12529'V;
and Matz, 2018'Vdoi: 10.1016/j.tig.2017.11.002'V), the
problem is that I do not know anyone who has personally
used it so I am cautious.
On the other hand, there are two main issues to take
into consideration upon making this decision. Firstly,
the weevils cannot be bred in laboratory conditions and
are quite hard to nd in the wild, therefore, the amount
of RNA that will be available is still unknown and I
will need to make at least 3 replicates. Also, funding
is incredible low: in a year the price of an American
dollar has gone from 23 Argentinian pesos to 60 which
means our ability to pay (in US dollars) for the libraries
and sequencing has plummeted and that situation is not
likely to change in the near future.
From this transpires the fact that we will to maximize
the RNA extracted per ovary (on that topic I have
found this protocol based on Matz (2002) and would
be very grateful for your thoughts about it: http:/-
/evrogen.com/technologies/RNA-isolation.shtml), but
the minimum amount of RNA per sample will also be
important in choosing which method to use: for RNAseq
we will need at least 500 ng of RNA per sample while
for TagSeq protocols, some companies can go as low as
needing 10 ng of RNA per sample.
What do you think about the two methods? Is one
truly better or worthier than the other for detecting
dierential gene expression? What would your approach
be if you were in my shoes?
Thank you all in advance! I am willing to post all
replies...

POSITION: Postdoctoral Associate (bee-microbe inter-
actions)
STARTING DATE: January 2020 (approximately)
LOCATION: Comstock Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca,
NY 14850
SUMMARY: We seek a post-doc to work on the char-
acterization of bacterial and fungal communities in the
pollen provisions of solitary bees. The ???brood cell
microbiome??? forms an important component of bee
larval nutrition and recent studies have indicated that
disruptions to the brood cell microbiome can have sig-
nicant negative impacts on larval growth and develop-
ment. We seek a candidate with a strong background
in molecular characterization of microbial communities
who can apply a variety of methods, including amplicon
sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and culture-based
techniques to explore the native microbial communities
of ground and stem-nesting bees and how perturbations
to these microbial communities impact bee health. We
are working largely with mason bees (Osmia cornifrons).
Expertise in wet-lab techniques of DNA and RNA extrac-
tion, Next-gen library development, and downstream
bioinformatics analyses is essential. The successful can-
didate should have excellent oral and written communi-
cation skills, should be capable of independently writing
research articles arising from the research, and should be
comfortable communicating with collaborators at other
institutions. The successful candidate will be expected
to contribute to lab management and supervision of
graduate and undergraduate students in the lab.

EMBL Europe PopgenDevelopment
A postdoc position is available in Eileen Furlong's lab
to use population genetics to dissect cis and trans regu-
lation in developmental networks, using Drosophila as
a model. The study will dissect robustness and canali-
sation in developmental programs. If interested please
contact furlong@embl.de Our two recent studies provide
a proof of principle of using Drosophila populationsfor this purpose (Cannavo et al, Nature 2017; Schor
et al, Nature Genetics 2017). Due to the very small
blocks of LD, we could get to the causal SNP in over
50% of the cases. This allowed us to functionally link
enhancers to promoters. The current project will rst
scale up and perform a large scale eQTL study during
Drosophila embryogenesis in two conditions and then
use this information to uncover new regulatory princi-
ples of development networks. The project will be done
in collaboration with Trudy Mackay and Oliver Stegle,
two outstanding leaders in their elds. EMBL is a truly
international and interdisciplinary institute - with a very
open, interactive and supportive culture making it a fun
place to work (great day care onsite). We are located
in lovely Heidelberg, a gorgeous old town with cobble
stones and a castle on the hill, with lots of outdoor ac-
tivities (rock climbing, trail biking, hiking). This is an
excellent central location to explore Europe and inter-
national science. I take mentoring seriously - Post-docs
form my lab have done very well in nding faculty posi-
tions - see http://furlonglab.embl.de/members#alumni
The lab is a mixture between experimental and com-
putational scientists where we work at the interface of
chromatin biology and developmental biology using ge-
netics, genomics (single cell approaches), imaging and
computational approaches.

Two Postdoctoral Positions Available at ETH Zurich in
the Plant Pathology Group of the Institute of Integrative
Biology
Evolutionary Ecology of Plant Pathogenic Fungi
We seek applicants with expertise in Evolutionary Bi-
ology, Quantitative Genetics, Microbiology, Population
Genetics, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, or Fun-
gal Ecology to lead a research group oriented around
the evolutionary ecology of plant pathogenic fungi. Ap-
plicants should be able to work independently and to96 EvolDir October 1, 2019
publish their research in excellent peer-reviewed journals.
Applicants should have eective communication skills,
both oral and written, and be able to lead and coordi-
nate a research team of 2-3 people. A good publication
record is essential.
Applicants should possess demonstrated experience in
research topics related to pathogen evolutionary ecology,
including expertise in one or more of the following areas:
quantitative biology, population genetics, population
genomics, quantitative genetics, quantitative genomics,
host-parasite molecular interactions, trade-os among
traits, pathogen competition during mixed infections.
Experience with fungi or plant pathogens is desirable,
though not required, but applicants who already have
experience with plant pathogens and fungi will have an
advantage. Experience with population and quantita-
tive genomics is also desirable. The ability to manage
and analyze extensive phenotype datasets containing
millions of data points is essential. The successful ap-
plicant will be granted a high degree of exibility in
research direction and approach. The position is renew-
able annually for up to six years. Female scientists are
especially encouraged to apply.
Our major areas of research are population genetics and
genomics, evolutionary biology, evolutionary ecology,
experimental evolution, and phylogeography. Our pri-
mary experimental organisms are the plant pathogenic
fungi Zymoseptoria tritici (aka Mycosphaerella gramini-
cola), Parastagonospora nodorum (aka Phaeosphaeria
nodorum), and Rhynchosporium commune (aka Rhyn-
chosporium secalis). Genome sequences are available
for all three fungi, including multiple nished reference
genomes for Z. tritici and P. nodorum. We have already
acquired complete genome sequences ( >20X depth) for
globally distributed eld populations for all three fungi,
with an average of ~130 high quality genome sequences
already analysed for each pathogen. We have developed
and implemented high throughput phenotyping methods
oriented around automated image analysis to acquire
millions of phenotype data points for a variety of impor-
tant traits, including virulence, reproduction, fungicide
sensitivity, and growth at dierent temperatures and
under dierent stresses.
As a result of earlier projects centered around QTL
mapping, GWAS, RNA seq and population genomics,
we have identied many candidate genes that contribute
to virulence, fungicide resistance, thermal adaptation,
and host responses. Several of these genes have already
been functionally validated, with more functional val-
idations underway. The successful candidate will lead
a research program that integrates the knowledge ob-
tained from these genomic and phenomic datasets to
understand trade-os among pathogen traits and iden-tify new candidate genes that play important roles in
the evolutionary ecology of these pathogens.
The ETH and the Institute of Integrative Biology possess
advanced infrastructure including the Genetic Diversity
Center (http://www.gdc.ethz.ch/) and the Functional
Genomics Center Zurich (http://www.fgcz.ethz.ch/).
Zurich is consistently rated as one of the most livable
cities in the world. The Plant Pathology Group (http://-
www.path.ethz.ch/) is currently composed of ~20 people
from 11 countries, and English is the working language
of the group. But knowledge of German or French is
useful outside of the university.
Applications consisting of a CV, publication list and a
detailed statement of research interests, with names
and contact information for 3 references should be
prepared as a single pdf le and sent by email be-
fore 1 December 2019 to Prof. Bruce A. McDonald
at bruce.mcdonald@usys.ethz.ch. Applications will be
processed as they are received, so it is possible that
both positions will be oered to excellent candidates
before 1 December 2019. The positions can be lled
beginning 1 January 2020 but will remain open until
suitable scientists have been found.

the Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki,
Finland. The position is for three years and will start
in October 2019, or later by agreement.
Project: Template switching is a poorly known muta-
tional mechanism that copies short stretches of sequence
from the opposite strand and causes clusters of dier-
ences between homologous sequences. The mechanism
has previously been studied in microbes and we recently
showed (https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/6/1039)
that mutation patterns consistent with it are polymor-
phic also in humans. The role and signicance of tem-
plate switching in evolution of genes and organisms is
not known.
We are now looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic
post-doctoral fellow to join in a project studying this
mechanism in more detail. The applicant is required to
hold PhD in evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, com-
puter science, or a related eld, as well as strong written
and oral communication skills. The working language of
the lab is English; knowledge of the Finnish language is

elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) defend them-
selves against infection despite immunogenetic deple-
tion caused by a severe population bottleneck in the
early 1900s. We are especially keen to explain why ele-
phant seals succumb to a particular species of nematode
(Otostrongylus circumlitus) but readily fend o other
helminths as well as viruses and bacteria that fell other
marine mammals. However, we also expect that the
successful candidate will strongly shape the direction
of the project according to the candidate's own vision,
creativity, and skill set.
The postdoctoral researcher will be an intrinsic part

candidate will be experienced at basic DNA techniques
(e.g. DNA extraction and purication, quantication,
etc.) as well as library preparation methods for RNA-seq
and BS-seq, and have a strong background in bioinfor-
matic analyses or computational genomics. Familiarity
with R, Python or Perl or a comparable language, and
bash/shell scripting is needed, as is experience with
aligners, assemblers, and other whole genome-based
utilities. We also expect experience with genome anno-
tation tools, databases, and other public repositories.
The postdoctoral researcher will also be responsible for
detailed and careful curation of the samples and related
genomic libraries.
Experience in cellular immunology, helminth parasitol-October 1, 2019 EvolDir 105
ogy, carnivore conservation, and/or marine mammal
medicine is also desired but not essential.

job&rmjob=10173&rmlang=UK Closing date:
November 5, 2019
Project description: The position is associated with a
project on characterising an enigmatic marine endosym-
biosis in the genus Meringosphaera. Meringosphaeraare single-celled eukaryotes that are globally distributed
and are considered photosynthetic based on consistent
observations of autouorescent 'green bodies' and ab-
sence of feeding behaviours. The autouorescent bodies,
however, have not been veried as true chloroplasts by
ultra-structure or genetic analysis. In fact, no molecular
data is available for Meringosphaera. The overarching
goals of this two year postdoctoral project are to char-
acterize the genetic integration and metabolic function
of the photosynthesizing bodies of Meringosphaera. A
suite of single cell methods wil be employed including
halogenated in situ-hybridization (HISH)-secondary ion
mass spectromtey (HISH-SIMS), ow activated sort-
ing (FACs) for single cell genome and transcriptome
sequencing, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
The position is a collaborative project between the lab-
oratories of Rachel A Foster from SU and Fabien Burki
from UU.
Main responsibilities: The position involves sampling,
imaging by CLSM, and attempts for cultivation of
Meringosphaera cells in enrichment cultures. Additon-
ally, managing the sample preparations for FACS, single
cell sequencing, and implementation of stable isotope
experiments and preparing and overseeing samples for
nanoSIMS analyses. Training will be provided when
necessary.
Qualication requirements: Postdoctoral positions are
appointed primarily for purposes of research. Appli-
cants are expected to hold a Swedish doctoral degree
or an equivalent degree from another country. The se-
lected candidate must possess expertise and knowledge
in microbial sampling as well as identifying and han-
dling small eukaryotic plankton. Experience in culturing
of microbial eukaryotes with background in eukaryotic
diversity and photosymbiosis will be seen as highly valu-
able. A suite of methodologies will be used in the
proposed work and hence the following skills are desir-
able: use of basic and/or advanced microscopy platforms
(epi-uorescence, CLSM), use and or understanding of
FACS, basic molecular based assays including kit based
assays (e.g. nucleic acid extractions, PCRs, genome am-
plication kits), library preparations for bar-coding, and
genome analysis. Previous experience with stable iso-
topes, and in eld expeditions (e.g. ocean-going cruises)
are also good qualications but not necessary. The can-
didate should be interested, motivated and exible to
move between the labs of Foster (SU) and Burki (UU)
as experiments will be carried out at both locations.
Candidates must be uent in English.
Assessment criteria: The PhD degree should have been
completed no more than three years before the deadline
for applications. An older degree may be acceptable
under special circumstances, which may involve sick106 EvolDir October 1, 2019
leave, parental leave, clinical attachment, elected posi-
tions in trade unions, or similar. In the appointment
process, special attention will be given to documented
research skills as described in the qualication require-
ments (e.g. assay development, cultivation, work with
single celled eukaryotes, various above mentioned single
cell methods), and publication history.
Terms of employment: The position involves full-time
employment for a maximum of two years, with the pos-
sibility of extension under special circumstances. Start
date as soon as possible, and no later than 2019-12-31.
Contact: Further information about the position can
be obtained from Dr. Rachel A. Foster, telephone: +46

UEdinburgh HostPathogenEvolution
The Vale group at the University of Edinburgh are
recruiting a Postdoctoral Researcher Associate to inves-
tigate mitochondrial genetic eects on innate immunity.
The post will be based at the Institute of Evolutionary
Biology within the School of Biological Sciences, but
will also collaborate with Dr Tiina Salminen (Tampere
University, Finland). The position is funded by a Lev-
erhulme Trust grant and is available from October 2019
for 2 years and 5 months.
The project Mitochondria are increasingly recognised
as important mediators of innate immune responses.
However, it is currently unclear how naturally occurring
variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contributes
to the widespread heterogeneity in infection outcomes.
The successful applicant will address this question using
Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful and genetically
tractable model of immunity where it is possible to gen-
erate cybrid lines with diverse mitochondrial genomes
introgressed onto controlled nuclear backgrounds.
This system is currently well established in our lab,
and the project will combine phenotypic, physiological
and genomic approaches to test the eect of specic
mitochondrial polymorphisms on cellular and humoral
responses to pathogens and parasitoids. Relevant skills
therefore include: carrying out large experimental infec-
tions using viral and bacterial pathogens and parasitoid
wasps; measuring phenotypic outcomes of infection (sur-
vival, microbe loads, behaviour); measuring immune110 EvolDir October 1, 2019
gene expression (RNA extraction RT-qPCR) and other
immune outputs (e.g ROS); disrupting mitochondrial
function either pharmacologically or using UAS-Gal;
preparing samples for, and analysing data from, tran-
scriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq); active knowledge of
statistical analyses using R.
We do not expect applicants to have expertise in all of
the above, and local support and training is available.
The applicant While the ideal applicant would have a
strong background in invertebrate immunity and mito-
chondrial biology, our main goal is to recruit someone
with broad interests in the ecology and evolution of host-
pathogen interactions who is enthusiastic and generally
curious about the causes and consequences of variation
in disease phenotypes. Demonstrated experience with
Drosophila genetics is highly benecial. However, we are
exible so if you think you might be a great t for this
position but are concerned about meeting all criteria
please get in touch before applying (to Dr Pedro Vale
(Pedro.vale@ed.ac.uk).
The lab and the department The Vale group addresses
the causes and consequences of individual variation in
the response to infection and we use the fruit y as a
model of infection, immunity and behaviour. The overall
aim of our research is to understand how individual-level
heterogeneity scales up to population-level disease out-
comes. More details about the lab and what we do can
be found here http://pedrovale.bio.ed.ac.uk/ . We are
based in the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, which
includes diverse expertise in evolutionary and ecological
genetics, host-pathogen interactions, and population
genomics in a range of study species. We work in a very
dynamic and sociable department and the successful
applicant should become an active member of the local
research community, and enjoy and thrive in such a
collaborative environment.

UManchester
EvolutionAntibioticResistance
The Lagator group at the University of Manchester are
recruiting a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work on
advancing the ability to predict antibiotic resistance evo-
lution by understanding the evolutionary consequences
of existing molecular mechanisms in cells. The project
is highly interdisciplinary, connecting biophysics, struc-
tural biology, and population genetics/evolutionary mod-
els, while working closely with an experimentalists. The
post will be based at the Division of Evolution and
Genomic Sciences, within the School of Biology.
Project Description One of the biggest outstanding prob-
lems in biology is how we can predict evolution. This
project will combine methods from biophysics, synthetic
and systems biology to study how the existing molec-ular mechanisms determine evolution. Understanding
this relationship will allow us to predict the eects of
mutations, and hence improve our ability to predict evo-
lution. This is particularly important when it comes to
understanding and predicting the evolution of antibiotic
resistance 'V one of the most important examples of
how evolution aects human lives today, already caus-
ing over 25,000 deaths per year in the EU alone, in
addition to dramatically extending hospital stays and
increasing health care costs. The aim of this project
is to improve our ability to predict multi-drug resis-
tance evolution by integrating mechanistic, biophysical
and evolutionary models in order to understand how
the existing molecular mechanisms in the cell determine
evolution. This project will develop a mechanistic model
that aims to predict the eects of mutations in promot-
ers and transcription factors that control the expression
of multi-drug resistance pumps (AcrAB-TolC). This will
allow us to understand how biophysical mechanisms de-
termine the eects of mutations in transcription factors
and promoters, and hence how they drive resistance
evolution. The model will then serve as the founda-
tion for performing evolutionary simulations in order to
study the consequences of dierent antibiotic prescrip-
tion regimes (e.g. altering usage periods of antibiotics,
rotating between them, etc.). Two posts are available
on this project. This postdoc (computation/theory)
will work together with an experimental postdoc, with
the aim to produce one of the rst predictive genotype-
phenotype maps, and hence dramatically improve our
ability to predict antibiotic resistance evolution from
rst principles This post is available for upto 2 years
in the rst instance. Further funding may be available
dependent on the progree and evolution of the project.
Candidate The ideal candidate will hold a Ph.D in theo-
retical/computational evolutionary biology, population
genetics, mathematics, physics, computer science, or
a related discipline, and will have a keen interest and
enthusiasm for studying evolution in a collaborative and
interdisciplinary setting.
Lab The recently-established Lagator lab uses interdis-
ciplinary and collaborative approaches to provide novel
insights into the evolution of gene regulation and antibi-
otic resistance in bacteria. The lab is situated within a
growing cluster of evolutionary microbiologists at the

an opportunity to work at the cutting-edge of evolu-
tionary biology with a PI who values independence and
intellectual curiosity.

BaboonEvolutionBehavior
A 2-year postdoctoral position is available to study
behavior-health-tness links in wild baboons as a mem-
ber of the Archie Lab at the University of Notre
Dame (http://sites.nd.edu/archielab/). The postdoc
will have access to extensive longitudinal data from
the well-studied Amboseli baboon population (http://-
amboselibaboons.nd.edu/), which has been the subject
of long-term, individual-based research since 1971. The
Amboseli baboons are a model in evolution and ecol-
ogy for understanding behavioral predictors of health,
microbiomes, aging, and tness. The data set is excep-
tionally rich and amenable to a wide range of projects,
either on the baboons themselves or in a comparative
context with other species. Strong, experienced appli-
cants will be encouraged to develop their own research
questions, but several projects (and data) are available
to understand: (i) how early life conditions shape social
development and social strategies; (ii) the links between
social behavior and multi-dimensional markers of physi-
ology/health/aging; and (iii) evolutionary or ecological
dynamics in the gut microbiome.
Candidates must have a PhD in biology or a relevant
social science (or plan to graduate in 2019 or 2020).
The ideal candidate will have outstanding skills in data
analysis, writing, and oral communication. Candidates
with experience in one or more of the following areas
are especially encouraged to apply: social behavioral
research, genomics, microbiome research, population-
based database analysis, population biology, biodemog-raphy, life history evolution, longitudinal data analysis,
or structural equation modeling. Familiarity or experi-
ence with social vertebrates (including humans) may be
helpful, but is not required.
The Archie lab oers a congenial research environ-
ment that fosters strong interdisciplinary training and
collaborative exchange. Collaborators include Susan
Alberts (https://sites.duke.edu/albertslab/), Fan Li (
http://www2.stat.duke.edu/ ~35/), and Ran Blekhman
(http://blekhmanlab.org/), all of whom are available
for advice and interaction. The postdoc is funded by an
NIH R01 award to Elizabeth Archie.
To apply, please send an email to Elizabeth Archie
(earchie@nd.edu), including a cover letter, CV, and con-
tact information for three references. The anticipated
start date is in winter or spring 2020, but this timing is
exible for strong candidates. Applications are rolling
and applicants are encouraged to submit their materials
by October 15, 2019 for full consideration.

UReading PhylogeneticTrees
Postdoctoral Research Assistant Position
Professor Mark Pagel of the School of Biological Sci-
ences at the University of Reading in the UK seeks
applications for a 2.5 year xed-term postdoctoral re-
search position to study a new method for inferring
time-calibrated phylogenetic trees from gene-sequence
or other sequence data, using a Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo approach. The position is funded by the
UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research
Council (BBSRC). The successful candidate will have a
PhD in biology, a related evolutionary discipline (such
as evolutionary anthropology) or possibly statistics and
computer science, and preferably have experience in
inferring or using phylogenetic trees in research. He or
she will join a research group working on problems in
phylogenetic inference and macroevolution, and with
strong computing resources and money for travel to
conferences.
The research will investigate the new method in simu-
lated and real data, and then apply it to inferring dates
on trees for which current methods return wide con-
dence intervals. Preference may be given to postdoctoral
candidates with a background in using Bayesian Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, the ability to
program in R, experience in summarising research, writ-
ing papers for publication and producing conference
presentations. However, an enthusiasm for research, an
ability to work well with others and an aptitude for
learning new methods can overcome lack of postdoc-
toral experience and will weigh heavily in the eventual
employment decision regardless of background.
This position provides an opportunity to work with one
of the leading international groups in phylogenetics and
comparative methods. The University of Reading is
situated in southern England, and enjoys a world-class
reputation for research, teaching and enterprise. It is sit-
uated close to London and has excellent transport links
to the capitol and airports. Informal (pre-application)
enquiries can be made to m.pagel@reading.ac.uk. Fur-
ther information and details for applying for the post

PaternalEectsProject
Are you interested in molecular ecology and/or ecotoxi-
cology?
We are looking for applicants to apply PhD/postdoc
grants to the following project:
Transgenerational eects of pollution via fathers: sperm
molecular alterations in birds
Environmental pollution increasingly presents a major
concern to humans and wildlife across Europe and in-
deed worldwide. Exposure to toxic pollutants, such as
heavy metals, may have a variety of ill eects on ver-
tebrates either by directly disrupting the physiology of
the organism or indirectly via eects on food quality
and availability in polluted environments due to toxic ef-
fects on prey species (e.g. invertebrates) [1]. In Europe,
wild passerines such as the great tit (Parus major) are
not only highly valued for their ecological and cultural
signicance, but also present valuable sentinel species
which can be used to indicate the impact of pollution
on wild vertebrates [2].
Importantly, the eects of pollution exposure may ex-
tend down multiple generations in a population. In
birds, this can occur by direct transfer of pollutants to
ospring via eggs/embryos by the mother [3], or via ef-
fects on hormone levels transferred to eggs/embryos [4].
However, while the majority of studies of have focused
on maternal eects, the male's role in transmitting ef-
fects of environmental exposures to the next generation
remain under-explored. Various types of environmental
exposures have been found to induce heritable alter-
ations to the ospring of exposed males, with evidence
stemming mostly from experimental studies on rodent
models [5]. These heritable eects have further been
linked with molecular alterations to the parental sperm
including alterations to DNA methylation [6], noncod-
ing RNA [5], and telomeres [7]. However, the molecular
makeup of the sperm in response to pollution exposure
has not been studied in birds, and the role of paternal
exposure has not been studied in wild populations.
Using a combination of experimental approaches us-
ing a Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) model and
eld studies on great tit populations in Finland and
Belgium with our collaborators, this novel project will
aim to ll these knowledge gaps in order to gauge the118 EvolDir October 1, 2019
extent to which such spermatozoal changes represent
a multi-generational vulnerability to ambient pollution
exposure.
The PhD student/postdoc will be positioned at the Uni-
versity of Turku, Finland, and supervised jointly by Dr.
Suvi Ruuskanen (University of Turku) and Dr. James
Ord (University of Tartu, EST). We are seeking a highly
motivated individual with interests in ecotoxicology, ani-
mal physiology, reproductive biology, and / or molecular
biology to undertake a unique interdisciplinary project.
The candidate will have opportunities to undertake eld
work in Finland and Belgium, and gain expertise in
physiological assays, qPCR, and RNA and / or bisulte
sequencing analysis. Prior experience in laboratory or
eld work is a plus.
There are multiple funding sources where grants for
this work can be applied, including Nessling Foundation

University Graduate School (DL 20.9, only for PhD
students), Finnish Cultural Foundation (31.10.) and

Dear colleague
We are currently collecting Expressions of Interest
for our Empowering agricultural research through
(meta)genomics series. The (brackets) means we treat
eukaryotic genomics and prokaryotic genomics equally
:-)
Previously held at the Bangkok campus of the pres-
tigious Kasetsart University, Empowering agricultural
research through (meta)genomics will now rotate to
another country that touches the Pacic ocean, with
Vietnam as one nominated location.
We try to be dierent: * This advanced workshop fol-
lows our unique format of combining wet- laboratory
techniques with scientic exploration and bioinformat-
ics analysis. * We value networking and professional
skill development. We include a Research Seminar day
participants can request to submit an oral or poster
presentation. * We also stream biologists and bioinfor-
maticians so they can learn with their peers and focus
on furthering their own expertise. * Our main role is not
to teach but facilitate bring world experts (established
or emerging) from Asia Pacic and work together with
the local culture. * We are passionate about equity
(nationality, gender, and career stage) and are striving
to make a change in our region. * We are all unpaid
volunteers so the costs are kept minimal.
In 2019, about 35% and 45.9% of our teachers and stu-
dents respectively identied as female and I hope we
can do much better next time. Of the joint student and
teacher pool, about 18% identied as a minority in their
country of residence and 70% where either students or
post-docs up to 5 years out of their PhD.Are you interested in attending as a student or becom-
ing a teacher? Then please register your Expression of
Interest here: https://forms.gle/c5khWV7SgPhzuaYE6
Please complete the form by the 10th of October. It's

LastCall
Dear all,
last 2 weeks before the registration deadline for our
course \Big data Biogeography 'V Species occurrences
through space and time" with Dr. Daniele Silvestro (Uni-
versity of Gothenburg (Sweden), University of Lausanne
(Switzerland)) and Alexander Zizka (German Center of
Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv))
When: 4-8 November 2019
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany)Summary: The public availability of large-scale species
distribution data has increased drastically over the last
ten years. In particular, due to the aggregation of
records from museums and herbaria, and citizen science
in public databases such as the Global Biodiversity In-
formation Facility (GBIF). This is leading to a ' ^A ¥big
data' ^A revolution in biogeography, which holds an enor-
mous but still poorly explored potential for understand-
ing large scale patterns and drivers of biodiversity in
space and time.
Target group Students and researchers working with bio-
diversity data and biogeography, including large species
occurrence data in biogeography or biodiversity research.
Example data will be available for all excises, but stu-
dents are encouraged to bring their own datasets. Dur-
ing the course, there will be time to work with the
students data.
Literature Two weeks before the start, participants will
be provided with ve articles as pdfs, to be read prior
to the workshop.
Objectives: After this course, students will be able to:
Obtain and prepare large scale species occurrence
records from public databases in R (including data min-
ing, data cleaning and exploration)
Apply novel methods for handling and processing ' ^A ¥big
data' ^A in biogeographic research, including area classi-
cation, bioregionalization and automated conservation
assessments
Reconstruct species ancestral ranges based on species
occurrences and phylogenetic trees, using dierent evo-
lutionary models
Understand the potential and caveats of fossil based
biogeography, and be familiar with novel methods to
estimate ancestral ranges and evolutionary rates from

Berlin LandscapeGenomics
Nov25-29
Course : LANDSCAPE GENOMICS (3rd edition)
When: 25th-29th November 2019
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Gemany)
Sets left: 6
Application deadline is: October 20th, 2019. Attendees
are seated on a rst-come, rst-served basis.
INSTRUCTORS :
1) Dr. St ephane Joost (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
2) Oliver Selmoni, MSc (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Course overview
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, we will dis-
cuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic data and
subsequently show how to study genetic variation and
population structure across space in the R environment.
We will give an overview of the dierent statistical ap-
proaches to study local adaptation, and the participants
will be trained in using two of them, Sambada and
LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task of
the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-
nally, the course will consider the crucial aspects andgood habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This course is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneti-
cists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evo-
lutionary biology and conservation. Even though the
course is not intended for a specialized audience, basic
knowledge in evolutionary biology and population ge-
netics would help. Students will learn how to use GIS,
but basic computer skills are desirable (e.g. in the R
environment). A basic understanding of statistics is also
necessary.
Teaching Format
The course is organized in ten learning sessions. During
the rst two sessions, the course will provide a contex-
tualization of the research eld. Then, students will be
guided through a landscape genomics experiment with
sessions that couple brief theoretical introductions with
practical work.

When: 17th-19th February 2020
Instructor: Dr. Laurent Gatto (de Duve Institute,
UCLouvain, Belgium)
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course58/ )
Registration deadline: 15th January 2020
Overview
This course will introduce participants to the analysis
and exploration of mass spectrometry (MS) based pro-
teomics data using R and Bioconductor. The course
will cover all levels of MS data, from raw data to iden-
tication and quantitation data, up to the statistical
interpretation of a typical shotgun MS experiment and
will focus on hands-on tutorials. At the end of thiscourse, the participants will be able to manipulate MS
data in R and use existing packages for their exploratory
and statistical proteomics data analysis.
Target audience and assumed background
The course is targeted to either proteomics practitioners
or data analysts/bioinformaticians that would like to
learn how to use R and Bioconductor to analyse pro-
teomics data. Familiarity with MS or proteomics in
general is desirable, but not essential as we will walk
through and describe a typical MS data as part of learn-
ing about the tools. Participants need to have a working
knowledge of R (R syntax, commonly used functions, ba-
sic data structures such as data frames, vectors, matrices
and their manipulation). Familiarity with other Biocon-
ductor omics data classes and the tidyverse syntax is
useful, but not required.
Program Monday - Classes from 9:30 to 17:30
During the rst day, we will focus on raw MS data,
including how mass spectrometry works, how raw MS
data looks like, MS data formats, and how to extract,
manipulate and visualise raw data.
Tuesday- Classes from 9:30 to 17:30
The second day will focus in identication data, how to
combine them with raw data, quantitation of MS data,
and introduce data structure of quantitative proteomics
data
Wednesday- Classes from 9:30 to 17:30
The last day will focus on quantitative proteomics, in-
cluding data structures, data processing, visualisation
statistical analysis to identify dierentially expression
proteins between two groups.

Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
Instructors: Dr. Mark Ravinet (CEES, Univeristy of
Oslo, Norway) and Dr. Joana I. Meier (University of
Cambridge, UK).
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t54/ )
Overview
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
growing eld of speciation genomics. The course aims
to take students from the initial steps required for han-
dling raw sequencing data to demographic modelling
and inference of genome-wide signatures of selection
and introgression. Through a combination of lectures
covering key theoretical and conceptual topics, along-
side hands-on exercises, participants will learn the most
important computational approaches used in speciation
genomics. This will include a heavy emphasis on data
visualization and intepretation. After completing of
the course, the participants should be able to begin
using NGS data to shed light on the genomic aspects of
speciation in their study system of choice.
Format
This course is designed for researchers and graduate
students with strong interests in applying novel high-
throughput DNA sequencing technologies to study the
population genomic basis of speciation. The course will
mainly focus on the analysis of NGS data for study
systems for which a reference genome is available. We
will provide theoretical lectures and hands-on exercises
drawing on examples of whole-genome resequenced and
RAD-sequencing data. Participants will make use of
the UNIX command line, R and Python throughout the
course.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background in
evolution and genomics. No programming or scripting
expertise is required. Previous experience in UNIX-
based command line and R is an advantage but a stan-
dard introduction will be provided. All hands-on ex-
ercises will be run in a Linux environment on remoteservers. Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStu-
dio.
Learning Outcomes
Handling NGS data from raw reads to genetic variants
Applying basic population genetic statistics
Visualizing the genetic structure
Inferring demographic history
Identifying regions under divergent selection or barriers
to gene ow
Understanding the potential and limitations of dierent
methods to detect regions under selection

Introduction to Bioinformatics using Linux (IBUL04)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-linux-workows-for-biologists-ibul04/ Free accom-
modation packages available with early registration -
Free accommodation if you are in full-time academia -
please ask oliverhooker@prinformatics.com
Martin Jones - Glasgow - 30th September - 4th October
2019
Course Overview:
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lift-
ing ' genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation
tools ' are designed to work best when used with a
command-line interface. Because the command line can
be an intimidating environment, many biologists learn
the bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools
working. This means that they miss out on the power
of Linux to customize their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.
Monday 30th ' Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Module 1: The design of Linux. In the rst session
we briey cover the design of Linux: how is it dierentOctober 1, 2019 EvolDir 127
from Windows/OSX and how is it best used? We'll then
jump straight onto the command line and learn about
the layout of the Linux le system and how to navigate
it. We'll describe Linux's le permission system (which
often trips up beginners), how paths work, and how we
actually run programs on the command line. We'll learn
a few tricks for using the command line more eciently,
and how to deal with programs that are misbehaving.
We'll nish this session by looking at the built in help
system and how to read and interpret manual pages.
Module 2: System management. We'll rst look at a
few command line tools for monitoring the status of
the system and keeping track of what's happening to
processor power, memory, and disk space. We'll go over
the process of installing new software from the built in
repositories (which is easy) and from source code down-
loads (which is trickier). We'll also introduce some tools
for benchmarking software (measuring the time/memory
requirements of processing large datasets).
Tuesday 1st ' Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Module 3: Manipulating tabular data. Many data types
we want to work with in bioinformatics are stored as
tabular plain text les, and here we learn all about
manipulating tabular data on the command line. We'll
start with simple things like extracting columns, lter-
ing and sorting, searching for text before moving on to
more complex tasks like searching for duplicated values,
summarizing large les, and combining simple tools into
long commands.
Module 4: Constructing pipelines. In this session we
will look at the various tools Linux has for constructing
pipelines out of individual commands. Aliases, shell
redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will all be intro-
duced here. We'll also look at a couple of specic tools
to help with running tools on multiple processors, and
for monitoring the progress of long running tasks.
Wednesday 2nd ' Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Module 5: EMBOSS. EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformat-
ics command-line tools explicitly designed to work in the
Linux paradigm. We'll get an overview of the dierent
sequence data formats that we might expect to work
with, and put what we learned about shell scripting to
biological use by building a pipeline to compare codon
usage across two collections of DNA sequences.
Module 6: ' Using a Linux server. Often in bioinformat-
ics we'll be working on a Linux server rather than our
own computer' typically because we need access to more
computing power, or to specialized tools and datasets.
In this session we'll learn how to connect to a Linux
server and how to manage sessions. We'll also consider
the various ways of moving data to and from a serverfrom your own computer, and nish with a discussion
of the considerations we have to make when working on
a shared computer.
Thursday 3rd ' Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Module 7: Combining methods. In the next two ses-
sions ' i.e. one full day ' we'll put everything we have
learned together and implement a workow for next-
gen sequence analysis. In this rst session we'll carry
out quality control on some paired-end Illumina data
and map these reads to a reference genome. We'll then
look at various approaches to automating this pipeline,
allowing us to quickly do the same for a second dataset.
Module 18: Combining methods. The second part of the
next-gen workow is to call variants to identify SNPs be-
tween our two samples and the reference genome. We'll
look at the VCF le format and gure out how to lter
SNPs for read coverage

Thanks, Doug
Background: In recent years, there has been a massive
increase in the amount of genetic data available; with
resources such as the UK and China-Kadoorie Biobanks,
researchers can now access data for thousands of pheno-
types and hundreds of thousands of individuals. There
has also been great progress developing genome-wide sta-
tistical tools for detecting causal variants, constructing
prediction models and better understanding the genetic
architecture of complex traits.
Course outline: We will cover a wide range of GWAS
analyses. We will begin with basic analyses, such as128 EvolDir October 1, 2019
quality control, single-SNP regression and classical poly-
genic risk scores. However, the main focus will be more
advanced analysis. These will include both methods
that use individual-level data (e.g., mixed-model associ-
ation analysis, G-REML, gene-based association tests,
using tools such as Bolt-LMM, GCTA and LDAK), and
methods that use summary statistics (e.g., heritability
and genetic correlation analyses, using tools such as
LDSC and SumHer). We will explain the principals
underlying these methods, highlighting both their com-
mon elements and dierences in underlying modelling
assumptions.
The course will compose of two lectures and two practi-
cals. The practicals will provide step-by-step details for
analysing genetic data, starting either with individual-
level data (e.g., PLINK les or the output from IM-
PUTE2) or summary statistics (p-values from a GWAS).
There will be a selection of worked examples; to take
part in the practicals, participants should bring a laptop
(ideally running either MAC or LINUX).
Prerequisites: This course is designed for researchers
who have at least some experience of GWAS. Partici-
pants should have a basic understanding of statistics,
and would ideally be familiar with the idea of a shrinkage
regression. Knowledge of SNP genotypes and linkage
disequilibrium will be assumed. Computer scripts and
output will be discussed that assume some familiarity
with scientic computing using Linux. Experience with
PLINK would be helpful but is not essential.

EvolutionCommunication Jan3
Hi all,
We are writing to announce an interdisciplinary work-
shop on spatio-temporal dynamics in animal communi-
cation, to take place in advance of the annual meeting of
the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in
Austin, TX. The workshop itself will occur on January
3rd, 2020 from 9 am - 2 pm.
The intention of the workshop is to identify new sci-
entic frontiers and challenges related to spatial and
temporal dynamics in animal communication. Partici-
pants will work in interdisciplinary working clusters led
by prominent researchers in the elds of behavioral ecol-
ogy, neuroscience, biomechanics, computational biology,
evolutionary biology, and philosophy. We expect these
interdisciplinary clusters will initiate collaborations, in-
cluding initiating a larger symposium on the topic at a
future SICB meeting.
We are particularly interested in engaging the input of
early career researchers who are beginning to work on
topics related to this subject. Funds may be available
to support travel and registration costs.
To indicate your interest in the workshop and topics
of particular relevance to your work, please ll out the
brief survey at the following link: https://forms.gle/-

Abstract:130 EvolDir October 1, 2019
We are organizing a workshop-symposium combination
that seeks to integrate approaches from neuroscience,
cognitive ecology, biomechanics, spatial ecology, ma-
chine vision, evolution, and animal behavior to address
the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex signaling. The
workshop, to take place in 2020, will focus on identify-
ing key questions and promising frontiers on this topic.
A subsequent SICB symposium will then extend upon
these discussions to highlight new directions in the eld.
During the workshop, interdisciplinary research teams
will discuss critical needs and open research questions
related to topics which may include: 1) coordination
of spatial positioning between senders and receivers
during dynamic communicatory interactions, and the
evolution of cognitive mechanisms and signaling fea-
tures that aid in such coordination 2) biomechanical,
neurophysiological, and ecological constraints on dis-
play production and the eective direction of signals
toward appropriate receivers across space and time, 3)
receiver encoding of complex signals from neurobiologi-
cal and cognitive perspectives, thereby linking variation
in signal spatiotemporal dynamics to attention, habit-
uation, learning, localization, and scene analysis, 4)
machine learning and social network tool development
for improved characterization of spatiotemporal dynam-
ics. Our objective is to motivate/guide researchers in
applying approaches and knowledge from other disci-
plines to generate new experimental designs, analytic
tools, and theoretical paradigms that will advance our
understanding of spatiotemporal complexity in animal
communication.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
