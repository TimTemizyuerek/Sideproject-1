Dates: 11-14 June 2018
Place: Bangalore, India
The 8th International Conference on the Biology of
Butteries conference will be held in Bangalore, India,from 11-14 June 2018. The International Conferences on
the Biology of Butteries are international gatherings,
organized every four years, of primarily professional
biologists who study evolutionary biology, behaviour,
ecology, systematics, biogeography, genetics, develop-
mental biology, and biodiversity conservation, with but-
teries and moths as their focal study organisms. This
is an excellent academic and professional forum for lat-
est discoveries and to exchange news in these research
areas.
Tourism: Visiting Bangalore for the conference will
also provide a fantastic opportunity to for cultural and
natural history tours. We are organizing a 1 day pre-
conference eld trip to Makalidurga near Bangalore,
and will facilitate longer post-conference trips to some
exciting places in the Western Ghats. The BoB website
has more information. We encourage you to visit along
with family and friends
Workshop: We will also have a 3 day post-conference
workshop (19-21 June) intended primarily for students
interested in buttery biology. This will be held in
Coorg, ca. 270 km from Bangalore.

Animal life-history is characterised along a slow-fast
continuum: \slow" species, populations, or individuals
exhibit slow developmental rates, low and delayed re-
productive outputs, and long life spans, whereas those
on the \fast" track express the opposite traits. This
continuum is captured by the 'pace-of-life syndrome'
(POLS) concept according to which certain combina-
tions of life-history, behavioural, and physiological traits
(i.e. syndromes) may yield higher tness than others,
depending on the environment. The POLS concept
is appealing to multiple research disciplines due to its
capacity to predict relationships among diverse traits.
However, empirical studies provide mixed support for
POLS. This session is aimed at examining the generality
of the POLS concept. We welcome all submissions (talks
and posters) related to the POLS concept but especially
encourage studies investigating (1) which combinations
of traits are (or are not) consistently linked, (2) if links
between traits persist across environmental gradients,
stress gradients, or time, and (3) which proximate mech-
anisms facilitate or constrain trait (co)variation. The
aim of the session is to establish an overview of the
current state of research on POLS, and help bridge a
gap between physiologists and evolutionary, behavioural,
and molecular ecologists in order to further understand
the importance of POLjmprok@utu. jmprok@utu.

EvolutionOfRegeneration Jun26-29
Dear all,
We are pleased to announce our symposium \Evolution
of Regeneration in Metazoa" as part of the 7th Euro
Evo Devo meeting in Galway, Ireland, 26th-29nd june
next year (2018) http://www.evodevo2018.eu/ehome/-
evodevo2018/Welcome/ . SYNOPSIS.This symposium
is dedicated to the re-emerging eld of regeneration,
a widespread phenomenon in animals. Using a large
variety of metazoans species and modern techniques, we
intend to get a general view of the evolution of animal
regeneration as well as to test the presence of general
principles and/or shared genetic programs that under-
lie this intriguing phenomenon. A specic attention
will be given to the identity, plasticity and dierentia-
tion potential of the cells required for the regeneration
processes.
Our Invited speakers are Dr Maja Adamska (Australian
National University, Canberra, Australia), Dr Karen
Echeverri (University of Minnesota, USA), Dr Uri Frank
(National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland) and Dr
Jochen Rink EMBO Young Investigator Lecture (Max
Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics,
Dresden, Germany).
We invite you to submit an abstract follow-
ing the online instructions on the Congress web-
site (http://www.evodevo2018.eu/ehome/evodevo2018/-
Registration/). Deadline for abstract submission (+
registration required) is 16th February 2018. Deadline
for early Bird Registration Fee is 13th April 2018.

Aug11-16
Hi, I would like to place the following announcement
in EvolDir: We invite you to attend ISBE 2018, the
next meeting of the International Society for Behavioral
Ecology. The meeting will be held at the Convention
Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A., from 11-16

tion of behavioral ecologists on hand for an outstanding
lineup of invited speakers from all over the world, as well
as the usual contributed talks and poster sessions and,
of course, the traditional soccer match. In addition to
the fantastic science, there are lots of reasons to attend
ISBE 2018. The city of Minneapolis, and its nearby
sister city of St. Paul, create a vibrant cosmopolitan
area (the \Twin Cities") with much to oer, and \the
Land of 10,000 Lakes" (i.e., the State of Minnesota) hasunmatched opportunities for outdoor activities ranging
from canoeing to hiking and backpacking. Check out
our excursions and attractions page for some ideas on
things to do before, during, and after your visit. In the
meantime, to receive periodic updates you can follow us
on facebook and twitter using the \Follow" link above.
We look forward to seeing you in the Twin Cities in
August!

Organizers: Steven Brady, Daniel Bolnick, Anne-Laure
Ferchaud, Charles Perrier, Donald Waller
Evolutionists seek to understand how populations adapt
to environmental change and to predict the consequences.
Selection that lags the pace of environmental change and
inbreeding resulting from habitat loss and fragmentation
both act to diminish the degree to which populations are
adapted to their environments. Genetic drift in smaller
populations also acts to constrain responses to posi-
tive and purifying selection. This will tend to increase
the xation of deleterious alleles, reducing population-
wide tness. These non-adaptive forces could eventually
overwhelm adaptive ones, limiting adaptive potential8 EvolDir February 1, 2018
of populations. Advances in genomics now empower us
to detect and map adaptive and mal-adaptive variation
across the genome. We welcome theoretical, method-
ological and empirical contributions that: (1) assess
mal-adaptation and accumulated genetic load; (2) ex-
amine the role of inbreeding and other demographic
processes in maladaptation; (3) describe the genetic
causes of mal-adaptation including the eects of domi-
nance, linkage and identity disequilibria, epistasis, and
gene ow; (4) enhance theory on the extent of genetic
change needed to rapidly adapt to rapidly changing en-
vironments, and (5) evaluate opportunities for genetic
rescue versus the risk of extinction.

AdaptationAncientDNA
Dear colleagues,
Happy new year.
We are happy to invite abstract submission to
our symposium on Ancient DNA studies of adap-
tive processes through time (S43) at the Evolu-
tion 2018 conference in Montpellier, France (http:/-
/evolutionmontpellier2018.org/symposia ).
Abstract submission is open until 15 january 2018,
see: http://evolutionmontpellier2018.org/call-abstracts
Long-term time series data have the benet of being able
to estimate eective population size through time using
neutral markers and identify the timing of demographic
change relative to ecological change; and to quantify the
tempo and chronology of changes in allele frequencies
and sites known to be the targets of natural selection
during ecological shifts. Given the temporal aspect of
adaptation and speciation, ancient DNA (aDNA) tech-
niques are an obvious and promising tool with which
to track the progress of natural selection's eect upon
the genome using time-series data. However, the emerg-
ing eld of palaeogenomics has been under-exploited in
studying this temporal component of adaptation and
speciation. Here we propose to take the eld a fur-
ther step forward by utilising palaeogenomics to bridgethis gap, allowing multi-locus adaptation, speciation
and multi-species adaptive radiation to be investigated
along the evolutionary continuum, from inception to
completion.

BalancedPolymorphism
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to invite abstract submissions to our
symposium \Ecological and genetic mechanisms under-
lying balanced polymorphisms", at the joint ESEB-SSE
Congress in Montpellier, France (19-22 Aug. 2018).
The aim of this symposium is to integrate the many
facets of our knowledge of balanced polymorphisms and
foster cross-talk between research on the genetics of poly-
morphic traits, and research on the ecology of selection
explaining the maintenance of those polymorphisms.
We are also interested in research on the evolutionary
paths to the formation of dierentiated polymorphisms,
composed of several characters with epistatic interac-
tions.
Our invited speaker will be Clemens Kupper from the
Max Plack Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Ger-
many, who will be speaking on \The genetics and evo-
lution of elaborate mating behaviours in birds".
NOTE: ***The deadline for submissions is January 15th
2018***.
Abstracts may be submitted at: http://-
evolutionmontpellier2018.org/call-abstracts Our
symposium abstract: This symposium will explore
how balanced polymorphisms evolve, and how multiple
complex strategies arise and are maintained within
populations. Sometimes called syndromes, complex
polymorphisms typically coordinate variations in
morphology, behaviour, and/or life history traits.
Classic examples include distinct sexual tactics in birds,
alternative pollination strategies in plants, coexisting
colony types in ants, mimicry polymorphisms inFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 9
butteries.
Contributions will address how polymorphisms that re-
quire the appropriate segregation of multiple underlying
mutations are generated and maintained. We welcome
contributions from empirical and theoretical perspec-
tive, and aim to highlight the considerable progress that
can be driven by the combination of ecology, genet-
ics and genomics. While some approaches clarify the
genetic basis and the recombination landscape underly-
ing the co-segregation of multiple traits (e.g. inversion
polymorphisms, large structural variants, supergenes),
other approaches focus on the tness landscapes asso-
ciated with stable polymorphisms (sexual antagonism,
self-incompatibility, frequency-dependent selection, het-
erozygote advantage). Combining those facets, a clearer
picture emerges of how and why genes and their as-
sociated characters co-vary in linkage disequilibrium.
A third facet to our understanding of complex poly-
morphisms is to address the apparent paradox of how
dierentiated haplotypes are formed in the rst place,
and how new combinations of epistatic characters may
be picked by selection.

EvolutionaryImmunology
We welcome abstracts submitted for our symposium
\Evolutionary immunology: tradeos and mechanisms"
(S15) at the 2018 Joint Congress on Evolutionary Bi-
ology in Montpellier, France, (August 19th-22nd) with
Scott Edwards as the keynote speaker.
The deadline for abstract submission is January 15,
2018. For further information please see http://-
evolutionmontpellier2018.org/symposia Submissions
are encouraged from scientists from diverse backgrounds
with the goal of exploring how studies of disease can ad-
vance evolutionary biology and encourage evolutionary
applications in medicine.
Sincerely,
Jamie Winternitz, Jessie Abbate, Randolph Nesse, Frank
R^A^A1hli (organizers)
SYNOPSIS: There is growing interest in the role of
trade-os on the evolution of host defense strategies,
such as competition between resistance vs. tolerance
mechanisms, protection against a diversity of foreign
invaders vs. vulnerability to autoimmune and inam-
matory disorders, or exposure to multiple coevolving
pathogens. Excitingly, advances in high-throughput se-
quencing technologies present the opportunity to move
beyond candidate gene approaches to study host resis-
tance using unbiased whole-genome approaches of both
the host and pathogen. In addition, genome-wide asso-
ciation study (GWAS) approaches could also reveal the
relative importance of select genes of large eect versus
many genes of small eect across the genome for disease
resistance. Thus, GWAS oer the potential to reveal
new insights into the genetic basis of parasite-mediated
selection on host and pathogen genetic diversity. Thissymposium will also explore how co-evolution shapes
asymmetric tness landscapes that result in apparent
suboptimal immune function. Given the recent explo-
sion of autoimmune disorders in recent decades, we
especially encourage presentations that investigate this
pattern through evolutionary immunological studies of
trade-os between resistance and autoimmune diseases.

FloralEvolution
Dear colleagues,
A reminder that the deadline for submitting abstracts
to the ESEB-SSE joint meeting is only a few days away,
on Monday January 15. The meeting will take place
August 19-22 in Montpellier, France. We encourage
you to submit an abstract to our symposium on Floral
Evolution.
Our symposium is S70 : Floral evolution: breeding
systems, pollinators, and beyond. Dr. Nina Sletvold,
from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, is the invited
speaker. Her talk is entitled \Abiotic factors, biotic con-
text (antagonists, community) and pollinator-mediated
selection".
Abstracts can be submitted at http://-
evolutionmontpellier2018.org/call-abstracts . Talks
and posters of this symposium (S70) will be invited
to submit for publication in a special issue of the
International Journal of Plant Sciences. With your
contributions, we are looking forward to a great
symposium and an excellent special issue.
Symposium abstract: Pollinator-mediated selection is
the major paradigm dominating the theory of oral
evolution. It has been proposed as the major force
directing oral trait evolution, from ower colour to
phenology and oral shape. But some recent studies
have raised questions about the relative importance of
pollinators as selective agents on oral traits. Herbi-
vores and abiotic stresses may counterbalance and mask
pollinator-mediated selection. In addition, a plant breed-
ing system can aect pollinator attraction and impact
oral evolution. These processes can all be inuenced by
anthropogenic changes such as habitat loss and global
warming. Finally, the genetic architecture of oral traits
may constrain oral evolution and despite the major
impact of oral shape on plant reproductive success, theFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 11
quantitative exploration of oral shape, its evolution
and diversity, and its molecular basis have received little
attention. In this symposium, we intend to broaden
the scope of pollination ecology in order to enhance our
ability to detect the evolutionary consequences of plant-
pollinator interactions. We propose to bring together
new and exciting studies that shed light on evolutionary
processes that shape owers and reproductive organs in
plants. Emphasis will be given to factors beyond polli-
nation and factors that interact with pollination, from
co-acting selective agents to the genetic basis of oral
traits. The proposed symposium will emphasize the
multifaceted process of natural selection and reexamine
established paradigms in the light of new ndings.

GlobalChange
Dear Colleagues,
We welcome abstract submissions to the symposium
on: \Rapid Evolutionary Responses to Global Change,"
for the 2018 Joint SSE+ESEB Congress in Montpellier,
France.
***The deadline for submissions is January 15th
2018***. Abstracts may be submitted at: http://-
evolutionmontpellier2018.org/call-abstracts Title of the
Symposium: Rapid Evolutionary Responses to Global
Change
Global climate change ranks among the greatest threats
facing humanity, and evolutionary responses will be most
certainly needed for many species to avoid extinction.
While there is mounting evidence for species responses
to global change, we still lack the ability to predict
whether and the extent to which populations could re-
spond to this change. This Symposium attempts toconsolidate state-of-the-art knowledge on evolutionary
responses and enhance our capacity to make predic-
tions about adaptation and extinction to global change.
Specically, we need to increase our understanding of
what role evolutionary processes play in species range
shifts, what types and number of genetic mutations are
most likely to be adaptive, or what is the importance
of genetic adaptive evolution vs phenotypic plasticity.
These questions need to be explored in a variety of
biotic and abiotic stresses as they might have dramati-
cally dierent natures, namely temperature rises, severe
droughts, acidication and salinity decline of the seas,
or new pests. We invite work on wild populations, ex-
perimental evolution, quantitative genetic experiments,
and theoretical population genetic models, and we en-
courage participants to discuss from such diverse angles
the question of rapid evolution and adaptation. We plan
to use this symposium as a launching point to integrate
knowledge across disciplines and stimulate discussion
on areas that require further investigation, so that we
could gain fundamental insights.

oral presentations and posters will be accepted through
15 January). We look forward to your submissions. Sym-
posium Abstract: As a critical component of speciation12 EvolDir February 1, 2018
and sexual selection, mating behavior has long been an
area of study in evolutionary biology. In an attempt
to investigate its mechanisms, we have gained abun-
dant insight into the sensory, neural and physiological
processes behind mating behavior. With the advent of
increasingly rened tools and their application to many
diverse organisms, we now have a better understanding
of the mechanisms underlying the evolution of mate
preference, mating behavior and more generally sexual
selection. This symposium will integrate what we have
learned about the various components of mating behav-
ior, including sensory systems, mate preferences as well
as mating systems and reproductive behavior. Our goals
are to (i) highlight recent studies from diverse elds and
organisms, with an emphasis on genetic and genomic ap-
proaches, in order to provide a synthetic understanding
of the evolution of mate preference and mating behavior;
and to (ii) provide a platform to generate a roadmap
for future research in these areas.

Title: Causes and Consequences of Recombination Rate
EvolutionInvited Speaker: Mohamed Noor
Is Variation in Recombination Rate Adaptive?
Summary:
Meiotic recombination plays fundamental roles in evo-
lution and genetics. By controlling linkage between
loci, recombination mediates the eciency and eects
of natural selection on both benecial and deleterious
mutations. Recombination shapes the evolution of DNA
sequence composition via biased gene conversion and
drives uctuations in genealogical history along chro-
mosomes. In many species, recombination also ensures
the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes at
meiosis and is essential for the maintenance of genome in-
tegrity. Despite its central biological signicance, recom-
bination rate varies among individuals, between species,
and across genomes. Our symposium will highlight re-
cent discoveries about the causes and consequences of
variation in recombination rates. We intend to show-
case research that cuts across genomic and evolutionary
scales - from recombination hotspots to whole genomes,
and from individuals to clades. We expect our sym-
posium will unite the perspectives of empiricists and
theoreticians whose work on recombination rate evolu-
tion remains disconnected.

SexualConict
Dear Colleagues,
We are excited to announce our symposium on the 'Man-

2018 Evolution conference in Montpelier, France.
Abstract submission is open until 15th January 2018 at
http:// evolutionmontpellier2018.org/call-abstracts
The invited speaker to our symposium is Craig Primmer
(University of Helsinki) who will be talking about his
work on sex dependent dominance and sexual conict
resolution in salmon.
Males and females are often subject to contrasting selec-
tion pressures, which can generate signicant amounts
of sexual conict when traits have a shared genetic basis
between the sexes. Sexual conict has the potentialFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 13
to substantially increase standing genetic diversity in
populations and thereby act as an important force in
adaptation. However, the causes of sexual conict, and
the mechanisms by which it can be resolved, remain
hotly debated. Recent studies have begun to combine
phenotypic studies, population genetic methods, and
genome wide sequence data to identify targets of sex-
ual conict. Now is a pertinent time to: i) synthesize
the population genetic signatures arising from sexual
conict, and how they vary according to the type of
sexual conict; ii) highlight our understanding of the
consequences of conict; including the role of balancing
selection in maintaining population genetic diversity;
and iii) develop a cohesive understanding of the poten-
tial genomic mechanisms leading to the resolution of
sexual conict, including the relative roles of gene ex-
pression, alternative splicing, imprinting and sex-linkage.

Symposium S8: Social behavior and evolution in the
omics eraSymposium Abstract:
>From genes cooperating to form organisms to ani-
mals cooperating to form societies, all of life is social.
Social behaviours, including cooperation, aggression,
mating, and parenting, have historically been conned
to studies of organismal- or population-level phenotypes.
Thanks to the -omics revolution, it is now possible to
dissect the evolution of these behaviours to the geno-
typic level. Furthermore, in the study of mutualisms,
genomics have been used to unveil previously hidden mi-
crosymbionts, while transcriptomics, metabolomics and
proteomics have identied which genetic and metabolic
pathways are used and therefore how individuals are
interacting. Omics methodologies can be used to iden-
tify social cheats and infer evolutionary dynamics in
natural populations, and will be central to examining
the consequences of social behaviours for genome evo-
lution and gene expression, both within and between
species. This symposium will bring together researchers
using omic approaches to clarify fundamental aspects of
sociobiology and behavioural ecology including who is
interacting and how, and those attempting to link the
occurrence of social behaviours with variation across
the genome, transcriptome and metabolome.

We hope this symposium will be the opportunity to14 EvolDir February 1, 2018

(inversions, duplications, etc..) in evolution, from the
apparition of novelty (*de novo *genes...) to adapta-

. S27. Moving beyond point mutations: the role of
structural genomic variation in adaptation and novelty
Abstract: One of the key challenges in evolutionary
biology is to understand how novelty arises. Genomic
structural variants, such as large indels, translocations,
duplications and inversions, are ubiquitous in nature.
However, their role in adaptation and diversication
remains largely unknown compared to single-nucleotide
mutations. Recent advances in genomics, notably single-
molecule long read sequencing combined with novel as-
sembly algorithms, have now empowered researchers to
systematically discover and characterize these complex
variants for the rst time. But how exactly do structural
variants contribute to novelty at the molecular level?
Remarkably, structural variants have been linked to the
spread and evolution of selsh genetic elements (trans-
posons, meiotic drivers and post-segregation distorters)
as well as the birth and diversication of gene families
(gene duplication and de novo gene evolution). Further-
more, transcriptomic and pedigree analyses suggest that
structural variants are frequently associated with QTLs
or neo-functionalization. With this symposium, we aim
to bring together researchers who apply experimental
and computational approaches to: 1) characterize struc-
tural variants, 2) test the role of structural variants in
adaptation and diversication, including studies with an
emphasis on selsh genetic elements and de novo gene
evolution, and 3) document the ecological determinants
of that govern the distribution of structural variants in
wild populations.

behavioural, and life history) and genomic evolution. In
particular, it is crucial to determine whether divergence
in phenotypes across urbanization gradients is the ex-
pression of either ecotypes adapted to urban conditions,
phenotypic plasticity, or non-adaptive evolution. Recent
projects have provided a small but growing number of
spectacular cases of rapid evolution and local adapta-
tion to the urban environment, and have also revealed a
promising potential to address eco-evolutionary dynam-
ics in this context. They have nally provided unique
scope to integrate evolutionary ecology in a conserva-
tion context. In the last ve years, the eld of urban
evolution has budded from the strongly established eld
of urban ecology, and blossomed into a vibrant and
dynamic multi-disciplinary area of study. This sympo-
sium oers to synthesize results from this burgeoning
eld, and simultaneously bridge biological conservation,
ecosystem function, ecological genomics and behavioural
ecology. We particularly encourage submissions of ab-
stracts that create bridges between these elds in all
taxa, approaches and spatio-temporal scales.

Hi
We would like to draw your attention to the follow-
ing symposia to be held at the 1st AsiaEvo confer-
ence in Shenzhen, China; April 18th-20th 2018 (http:/-
/www.asianevo.org/).
The deadline for abstract submission is January
20th 2018. There are 5 student and 5 postdoc
travel awards available (http://www.asianevo.org/-
programme/student awards.html).
Symposium #25: The evolution of behavioural re-
sponses in biological invasions Organizer: Kit Magellan
(University of Hong Kong)
Invited speakers: Jaimie Dick (Queens University,
Belfast); Martin Reichard (Czech Academy of Sciences),
Gudbjorg Asta Olafsdottir (University of Iceland)
Abstract: One of the greatest pressures on ecosystems
and biodiversity is biotic invasions. However, invasions
also provide a rare opportunity to observe and quantify
evolution in action: both invasives and natives must
adapt to species with which they have no evolutionary
history in order to survive. A key attribute of success-
ful invasive species is behavioral exibility. Conversely,
a likely immediate eect of invasions is disruption of
native species behaviour. These individual level eects
will translate to changes in population level parameters
and will inuence selection pressures on both native and
invasive species. Moreover, anthropogenic inuences
such as urbanization and climate change may facilitate
or oppose adaptation. Assessing the evolutionary in-
teractions between behaviour and biotic invasions is16 EvolDir February 1, 2018
therefore of critical global importance in the modern
world and for future generations.
Symposium #1: Rapid microevolution of invasive
species Organizer: Aibin Zhan (Chinese Academy of
Sciences)
Invited speakers: Hugh MacIsaac (University of Wind-
sor), Carol Lee (University of Wisconsin), Carolyn
Tepolt (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), Eliza-
beta Briski (GEOMAR)
Abstract: The introductions and spread of invasive
species globally have caused enormous costs to the econ-
omy ( ~ $1 trillion per annum in lost goods and services).
Such economic loss is particularly severe in countries
that have been highly impacted by invasive species, with
estimates for the UK, US and China of US $1 billion,
120 billion and 15 billion, respectively. Alarmingly, how-
ever, rates of biological invasions continue to accelerate,
thus posing growing and urgent threats to the global
environment and economy.
The study of microevolutionary processes in the wild
represents one of the major challenges in ecological and
evolutionary studies, especially those aiming to reveal
genetic bases of microevolution using wild populations.
Biological invasions provide good \natural experiments"
to deeply dissect processes and mechanisms of rapid
microevolution, as invasive species are transported into
and subsequently survive dierent local environments
in a short period of time. Consequently, natural selec-
tion associated with rapid and/or sudden environmental
changes may drive rapid microevolution in dierent di-
rections during the process of biological invasions.
This proposed section will focus on recent research di-
rections and progress, as well as future perspectives, in
the eld of microevolution using invasive species as a
model. The proposed internationally recognized well-
known experts will focus on dierent angles of rapid
microevolution at dierent levels, including ecosystem,
population and gene levels.

First AsianEvo Conference in Shenzhen, China, April
18-20, 2018

the call for abstracts for a symposium on:
Human Evolution and Adaptation (Session 41)
Invited speakers:

Planck Germany (CAS-MPG) Partnered Institute for
Computational Biology, China

Humans represent an excellent model system for under-
standing a key question in evolutionary biology: the
evolution and adaptation of a species. Broadly speak-
ing, two interwoven evolutionary forces have shaped
the human genome and molded present day genotype-
phenotype relationships: the demographic history of the
population and natural selection due to our past interac-
tions with a changing environment. Combining an abun-
dance of contemporary whole genome datasets from di-
verse populations with the emergence of ancient genomic
data has already illuminated details of our past evolu-
tionary processes. With the underlying demographic
history in hand, increased understanding of the role of
natural selection in the evolution of modern humans is
possible, forming a basis for evolutionary medicine that
could revolutionize how medicine is practiced. The suc-
cess of domestication in many human populations may
have intensied selection pressure in the past ~10,000
years owing to the change of life style and dramatic
growth of population size (e.g., selection for lactose per-
sistence and on many erythrocyte-related genes against
malaria). Consequently, many adaptively evolving vari-
ants may have very recent origins and likely segregate at
low frequencies in a population (recent selection). How-
ever, most statistical methods for detecting selection
have limited power of detecting low-frequency selected
alleles. Recently, the promise of precision medicine
has led to the development of population-based human
genome projects (usually >100,000 individuals) in many
countries in a high hope of making a complete list of
genetic variants underlying disease susceptibility. SuchFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 17
a gigantic dataset also provides us a great opportunity
to study patterns of genetic variation and detect sig-
natures of selection for low-frequency variants from a
very large sample size. Therefore, this symposium wel-
comes authors to present their work in understanding
human evolution in diverse populations through the
lens of demographic history and/or actions of natural
selections. These could include, but are not limited to,
either theoretical or empirical approaches, utilizing both
modern and ancient DNA samples. Moreover, interdisci-
plinary frameworks integrating insights from linguistics,
anthropology, medicine, or genetics studies of domesti-
cated animals or crop to address human evolutionary
questions will also be welcomed.

Dear Colleagues,
Please see below information detailing the upcoming
symposia \Insect Endosymbiont" and \Insect Infection
& Immunity" to be held in Liverpool, UK, on March
21st and 22nd 2018.
These meetings are sponsored by the Royal Entomologi-
cal Society and aim to bring together people working
on dierent facets of insect symbioses and infection or
immunity. We are running them alongside each other as
it makes sense to consider these interactions together:
symbionts can comprise part of the defence system of
the host, and can alter vector competence. Reciprocally,
the defence system of the host needs to discriminate
between friends and foe. We hope you can come to
both.
The Wednesday meeting will focus on specicity of sym-
biotic interactions, from functional aspects through to
evolutionary ecology. The Thursday meeting will include
immunity, defence, vector biology, evolution, biochem-
istry and ecology.
On Wednesday the invited speaker will be Prof Mar-
tin Kaltenpoth (http://www.bio.uni-mainz.de/zoo/-
oekologie/58 ENG HTML.php), who is best known for
his work on the beewolf-Streptomyces symbiosis in which
Streptomyces produce antimicrobials that are used bythe wasp to protect their ospring. In this meeting,
he will be talking about more recent work \Symbiont-
provided defense and nutrition in herbivorous beetles."
On Thursday our invited speaker will be Dr
Lena Wilfert (http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/sta/-
index.php?web id=Lena Wilfert), who has worked on
a range of pathogen/host interactions in insects, and
is currently working on pollinator disease ecology and
evolution. In this meeting, she will be talking about
\Man-made epidemics: the evolutionary ecology of multi-
host bee pathogens."
Both meetings will be small and informal, and short
talks or posters are welcome from everyone at any career
level. We would love people to attend both meetings,
as that way we can gain insights from each other.
Please register for both events separately here: https:/-
/www.royensoc.co.uk/events The cost for each separate
event is 10 for members, 15 for non-members, which
covers lunch and two tea breaks.
Please send abstracts for both symposia to sym-
biont2018@gmail.com, by no later than 23:59 on Monday
5th February. Please specify if you would like to present
a talk or poster and for which symposium. Please note
that the poster session for both symposia will be held
on Wednesday early evening.
For accommodation, https://-
www.hallmarkhotels.co.uk/hotels/hallmark-inn-
liverpool/ is a budget but OK hotel (40 per room
per night at the moment); for cheaper dorm beds,
https://hattershostels.com/liverpool-hostel/ (15 per
night at the moment in four bed dorm) are two places
near the University. For those liking nicer sleeps, The
Liner is mid-price, and Hope Street Hotel is in the more
luxury bracket; all are within walking distance of Uni.
It is a little advisable to book accommodation ahead to
insure against the unlikely event that Liverpool make it
through the Champion's League and are playing that
night (at which point, accommodation becomes hard to
nd and expensive).

*Abstract*
In the last two decades, the importance of higher order
statistical moments (e.g., variance, co-variance, skew-
ness and kurtosis) in biotic and abiotic factors slowly
made its way in ecology, traditionally a science of means
and averages. For instance, we know now that consid-
ering the variance around the mean temperature will
be essential for understanding the physiological, ecolog-
ical and evolutionary consequences of climate change.
Yet, many challenges still hold in this ourishing re-
search topic, which remains relatively under-explored in
aquatic ecology. In a multifactorial world, how variable
are the major ecological drivers compared to temper-
ature - by far the most studied factor? What are the
covariance patterns of environmental stresses and ex-
tremes, and at which spatio-temporal scales do they
occur? How do aquatic organisms perceive and deal
with such variability? What are the consequences of
ecological variance and extremes scaling from the organ-
ismal to the population and the community level? This
session welcomes theoretical and experimental studies
on such questions conducted at any temporal and spatial
scale, regardless if the variance is driven by physiolog-
ical changes, behavioural movements, environmental
gradients or seasonally driven successions of species.https://aslo.org/page/aslo-2018-summer-meeting {

CrustaceanAdaptation May22-25
Hi All, As the organizers of the special symposium on
\Adaptations to Life in the Deep Sea and Caves", we
wanted to remind anyone interested in participating in
this session (and the rest of the International Crustacean
Congress) that the early registration deadline (reduced
registration fee) is fast approaching | Jan. 15th.
We are inviting any crustacean or related researchers
working on topics of adaptations to life in the deep sea
and cave (see description below) to submit abstracts
to this symposium. Abstracts will be reviewed shortly
after the March 1st submission deadline and you will be
notied shortly after that about inclusion in this special
session.
To register go to http://www.birenheide.com/ICC2018/-
or http://crustaceansociety.org/upcoming-meetings .
Adaptations to Life in the Deep Sea and Caves Special
Session, 9th International Crustacean Congress, Wash-
ington, DC, USA, 22-25 May 2018
Animals living in the deep sea exhibit many adaptations
to the unique combination of challenges in the harsh
and poorly known habitats of the deep sea. Studies
of the morphology, physiology, behavior and ecology of
crustaceans living in the deep-sea pelagic and benthic
environments provide insight into the selective pressures
animals here face, as well as a better understanding of
the nature of the habitats themselves. Elaborations of
sensory systems, locomotory and buoyancy mechanisms,
and respiratory, reproductive and feeding strategies have
all been documented in deep-sea crustaceans.
Many of the adaptations that we see in the deep sea are
directly related to the lack of light in the habitat and the
complex of resulting traits has been termed the \Dark-
ness Syndrome" (Danielopol et al. 1996). We would22 EvolDir February 1, 2018
like to bring together researchers working in any dark
habitat for a portion of this session and welcome talks
from biologists working in caves and other dark habitats.
Please indicate along with your abstract submission that
you would like to be included in the Darkness Syndrome
portion of the session.
This session welcomes contributions from taxonomically
and methodologically diverse backgrounds, including
theoretical, taxonomic, morphological, physiological, be-
havioral, ecological, genetic and genomic, biomechanical,
neurological and developmental biology. Integrative ap-
proaches are particularly welcome.
We do not plan to publish a special issue. We do not
plan to apply for funding to recruit specic speakers.
The session will accept as many talk proposals as ap-
propriate based on submitted abstracts.
For any questions regarding the special session, please

Dear colleagues,
My co-organizer, Heather Bracken-Grissom, and I would
like to invite you to present your research in the ses-
sion Molecular Insights: The Genomic Revolution in
Crustacean Biology at the upcoming International Crus-
tacean Congress IX to be held May 22-25th 2018 in
Washington DC. The deadline for early bird registration
is fast approaching, *January 15, 2018.*
This conference is hosted by the Smithsonian Institution
and Renaissance Hotel. We hope this session will provide
a platform to share and discuss studies incorporating
crustacean genetics and/or genomics. We encourage
submissions that cover any crustacean taxa and we are
particularly interested in phylogenetics/omics, transcrip-
tomics, gene expression studies, tree of life studies, and
population genomics. Graduate Students, Postdoctoral
Scholars and Professors (at all levels) are encouraged to
participate!
If you are interested in participating please reach out
to Heather Bracken-Grissom at hbracken@u.edu or
Joanna \Jo" Wolfe at jowolfe@mit.edu as we expect the
session spots to ll quickly.
The deadline for abstract submissions is *March 1st
2018.*
More information on the conference can be found here

The eld of crustacean genetics has undergone an ex-
citing revolution in recent years. The advancement of
sequencing technologies and methods has transformed
the way carcinologists ask questions and collect data,
especially for non-model organisms that lack genomic
references. For several groups within Crustacea, this
genomic revolution is still in its infancy. The potential
to capitalize on recent technology is great, and ndings
from these studies will lead to unprecedented insightsFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 23
into the elds of evolutionary biology and molecular
ecology.
For this session, we would like to invite researchers
working in the eld of crustacean genetics/genomics.
We welcome contributions from phylogenetics/omics,
population genomics, transcriptomics, among others. In
addition to the abovementioned, theoretical and method-
ological talks will be considered.
We hope to highlight a diverse group of organisms that
span various elds of crustacean biology. Please indi-
cate that you would like to be included in the Molecular
Insights session.
We do not plan to publish a special issue.
We do not plan to apply for funding to recruit specic
speakers.
The session will accept as many talk proposals as ap-
propriate based on submitted abstracts.
We look forward to seeing you in DC!

Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to invite abstract submission to our
symposium \Virus genome evolution" at SMBE2018
in Yokohama, Japan. Abstracts may be submitted at
http://smbe2018.jp/ by January 25.
Symposium 34. Virus genome evolution
Viruses exhibit a unique parasitic situation that shapes
the evolution of their genomes. They evolved an exten-
sive amount of genomic diversity with a wide range of
complex life, reproduction, and inheritance strategies,
including the use of dierent genetic materials, genome
sizes, and a wide range of mutation rates. Virus evo-
lution has had a strong inuence on the evolution of
other life forms, acting as source of novel genes, facili-tating horizontal transfer, eliciting genomic alterations
caused by virus integration, and creating potent co-
evolutionary selective pressure. The evolutionary pro-
cess is also explicitly involved in many processes with
medical implications, such as host switching, immune
avoidance, and the development of drug resistance. The
study of virus evolution has proven critical for the study
of disease emergence and spread, exemplied by the
recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks. The use of genomic
approaches has transformed the eld of virology, en-
abling these and other issues to be answered with ever
more depth and precision. This symposium will high-
light recent advances on virus genome evolution and will
bring together dierent approaches on prokaryotic and
eukaryotic virus evolution; how these viruses originated,
diversied, and spread, how they change and adapt, and
how they co-evolve with their hosts.

We invite submission of abstracts to our SMBE 2018
symposium: Improving inference frameworks by ac-
counting for population structure Invited speakers: So-
hini Ramachandran and Amy Goldberg Population
structure encompasses a broad range of departures from
panmixis, including sex, mating system, geographical
subdivision, and admixture. A growing number of empir-
ical studies support the view that population structure
constitutes a signicant and pervasive feature across the
tree of life. Population structure can bias or invalidate
a host of inferences, including patterns of gene ow,
dates of admixture events, or signatures of selection.
Such ndings constitute a challenge to develop methods
that directly confront population structure and exploit
rather than avoid the higher-level associations it gen-
erates. For example, some studies for the mapping of
disease genes in humans attempt to minimize the eects
of population structure by restricting consideration to
samples from groups believed to have low admixture.
The development of methods that can accommodate
population structure not only promotes better inference
in all groups but also facilitates research with direct
implications for human health in groups that are under-
studied because of a history of admixture.24 EvolDir February 1, 2018
This symposium also seeks to encourage the study of
the extent to which population structure can mimic
signatures of selection or changes in eective number.

TimingMethods
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to invite submission of abstracts to the
SMBE 2018 symposium \Timing methodologies and
applications".
Abstracts may be submitted at http://smbe2018.jp/-
cfabstract.html by January 25.
*** Symposium 46: Timing methodologies and applica-
tions ***
Timing of species and gene divergences is a primary out-
come of many evolutionary analyses. The widespread
application of molecular clocks to a variety of datasets
and evolutionary histories has driven the diversica-
tion of these methods into many dierent approaches
that often produce discordant timelines. Despite many
eorts, generally applicable rules to reconcile these dis-
agreements are still elusive leaving researchers with the
dicult task of selecting most appropriate methods and
parameters based on limited information or requiring
complex comparative evaluations of multiple methods.
Unfortunately, many of these current approaches that
require multiple hypotheses testing are dicult to apply
to large phylogenomic datasets, thus exacerbating the
uncertainty in produced timelines. Participants in this
symposium will explore the diversity of molecular clock
methods and discuss their applications to simulated and
empirical sequences from methodological and applied
perspectives. The goal is to have an open discussion
on the strengths and weaknesses of each method and
identify best practices to reconcile dierent timelines.
The research studies showcased in this symposium will
explore the application of molecular clocks to species
and gene divergences in an eort to shed light on the
evolution of life through time.26 EvolDir February 1, 2018

YosemiteNatlPark Symbiosis
May4-6
Dear Colleagues,
The Eigth annual Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop will
take place on May 4th-6th, 2018 at the Sierra Nevada
Research Institute, Yosemite National Park. This has
become a great venue for a diversity of symbiosis re-
searchers. We hope to continue to attract a diverse
group in 2018!
Keynote speaker 2018: Dr. Tadashi Fukami from Stan-
ford University!
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our continuing goal is to better integrate the
broad groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis and
microbiome research. Yosemite serves as an ideal site as
it is both beautiful and secluded. This will be our 8th
annual meeting and we have been consistently attracting
scientists from all over the country and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in the mi-
crobiome, cooperation, mutualism, and symbiosis. In
the past we have covered a range of symbiosis topics
from ecology and evolution to molecular mechanisms in
dierent model and non-model systems. We would like
to make room for a diverse group of people so we will ini-
tially accept up to 3 lab members per group (including
the PI) on a rst come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held May 5-
6, 2018, though we make accommodation arrangementsFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 27
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 4th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting.
Past attendees and talks can be found here: http://-
www.sachslab.com/symbiosis-2015.php Abstract and
early bird registration are due on March 16th, 2018.
Where: SNRS has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room. Costs: See
details in the registration page. We will only be able to
accept credit card payments this year.

SpeciationGenomic
A PhD position in Genomics of speciation at Charles
University in Prague
Position available from October 2018
Application deadline: 18 ^th February 2018
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student to
join our group working on genomics of speciation in two
hybridizing songbirds, the Common Nightingale and the
Thrush Nightingale. These species hybridize in a sec-ondary contact zone and produce viable hybrid progeny.
In accordance with Haldane's Rule, hybrid females are
sterile, while hybrid males are fertile, allowing gene ow
to occur between the species. The two species also show
marked dierences in sperm morphology, which could
contribute to post-mating prezygotic isolation. The
main goal of the project aims at identifying genetic basis
and molecular mechanisms of both hybrid female steril-
ity and postmating prezygotic isolation. The project
will combine QTL mapping experiments and population
genomic analyses of transcriptomes and whole genome
sequences of both species. The candidates are expected
to have experience in analyses of next-generation se-
quence data and at least some background in popula-
tion or quantitative genetics. A previous experience in
wet-lab is an advantage.
Scholarship:
The scholarship (per month) will be 600 EUR (ca 15,000
CZK) with the possibility of increase each year. Note
that living expenses in the Czech Republic are generally
lower than in Western European countries.
How to apply: If interested, please, send (1) CV in-
cluding a list of publications, (2) motivation letter, and
(3) contact details for 2-3 references to Radka Reifova

ParrotDiseaseGenomics
We seek two outstanding, highly motivated PhD can-
didates to work on disease ecology and genomics in
Australian parrots.
This is an an ARC Discovery-funded project, 'Genomic
diversity, tolerance and ecology of wildlife disease',
with Professors Andy Bennett and Soren AlexandersenFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 31
(Deakin and GCEID), Dr Matt Berg (Deakin) and Pro-
fessor Scott Edwards (Harvard). The students will be
based at Deakin University, Geelong (near Melbourne,
Australia) in a research group in the Centre for In-
tegrative Ecology (CIE) and the Geelong Centre for
Emerging Infectious Diseases (GCEID) with opportuni-
ties for travel to Scott Edward's lab at Harvard USA.
The research project will commence in January 2018 and
students need to start by July 2018, preferably earlier.
Emerging infectious diseases are among the most sig-
nicant threats to conservation, agriculture and pub-
lic health worldwide. One such disease is caused by
the Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV), a single
stranded DNA virus which is spreading globally and
is poorly understood in wild populations despite being
a listed as a 'key threatening process to biodiversity'
by the Australian Federal Government. BFDV infects
primarily parrots, which are amongst the most highly
threatened bird taxa globally. We will study the virus
in the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) an emerging
model system for studying population divergence and
disease ecology, using a number of established eld sites
in south-eastern Australia. The primary aims of the re-
search are to study the inuences of tolerance, genomic
diversity, and candidate genes on BFDV dynamics in
rosellas, by combining genomic, pathological and ecolog-
ical approaches. Both PhD's are expected to conduct
eld work and lab work, but have dierent emphases.
PhD 1: This will be focussed on molecular analyses,
genomics and associated bioinformatics of both the host
and the virus but will also involve eld work (to as-
sist with sample collection). The main objectives of
this project is to test the role of genetic diversity and
genotype rarity in infection, infer the roles of selection
and candidate genes, and conduct phylogenetic analy-
ses. The project will be based in Deakin's CIE, with
additional training provided by GCEID and at Harvard
University.
PhD 2: This will focus on eld ecology and pathol-
ogy/immunology, with training provided in the CIE and
GCEID. The objectives are to investigate the patho-
logical and tness eects of BFDV infection in rosellas,
and to combine these data with quantication of infec-
tion levels to evaluate the contributions of resistance
and tolerance mechanisms to infection dynamics in this
system.

BBSRC CASE PhD studentship: The evolution of in-
breeding depression in wild ax and implications for
crop development.32 EvolDir February 1, 2018
Supervisory team: Dr Adrian Brennan, Prof Rus Hoelzel
(Durham, UK), Dr Catherine Kidner (Royal Botanic
Garden Edinburgh, UK) Novelty: Our research in wild
ax will use new genotyping by sequencing technologies
to obtain an unprecedented genome-wide perspective on
inbreeding and its evolution, allowing the identication
of relevant genes, and therefore the consideration of
molecular mechanisms. These insights could then be
applied to genetic improvement of ax to sustainably en-
hance agricultural production as well as improving our
understanding of this fundamental aspect of evolution.
Research training: Research training: The student will
gain bioinformatics skills that are in high demand both
within academia and in wider industry. The project in
general will require attention to detail, careful logical
thought, and excellent numeracy, all of which are highly
desirable transferable skills across all work sectors.
Background: Avoidance of inbreeding depression is un-
derstood to be a major force driving the evolution and
maintenance of sexual outcrossing reproductive systems.
By outcrossing, diploid organisms ensure the tness of
their ospring by maintaining heterozygosity. Humans
have been domesticating species to suit their agricul-
tural needs for the past 10k years. Articial selection for
individual traits often involves inbreeding and xation of
genetic variation. More recently, modern breeding prac-
tice has been able to reintroduce genetic variation and
hybrid vigour into many domesticated species leading
to impressive improvements in performance. Often this
involves crosses between distinct varieties but crosses
with wild relatives are also vital for introducing novel
variation.
New genetic technologies now oer unprecedented oppor-
tunities to study the relationship between heterozygosity,
reproductive system, and tness at a genome-wide scale.
We will address these questions in a model system, wild
ax, which sits at the interface between evolutionary and
applied biology. Cultivated ax is a globally important
crop for both bre and oilseed production and inbred
varieties have been shown to benet from hybridization.
Surprisingly little is known about reproductive system
and tness in wild ax, a potentially valuable source of
genetic variation for crop improvement.
Aims and Methods: We propose to test the extent and
nature of inbreeding and its relationship with tness in
wild ax. We will use new genotyping by sequencing
technologies to obtain an unprecedented genome-wide
perspective on inbreeding and its evolution, allowing
the identication of relevant genes and molecular mecha-
nisms. The CASE partner, RBGE, is an internationally
important organization responsible for the conservation
and study of plant and fungal biodiversity. This projectwill feed into the core scientic activities of RBGE to gen-
erate baseline botanical data, to document and conserve
plant biodiversity, and better understand evolutionary
processes in plants.
Application details: This PhD will fully fund students
with UK resident status or provide university fees
only to EU students (see http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/-
documents/news/terms-and-conditions-of-research-
council-training-grants/). Please contact Dr Adrian
Brennan, a.c.brennan@durham.ac.uk for further
questions or to apply with a CV and a cover letter by
25th February 2018 deadline. The PhD is available to
start as soon as March 2018 but a delay until the end
of the current academic year is also possible.

NOMIC EVOLUTION https://itn-contra.org Applica-
tion deadline: 23:59 CET on the 15 February 2018
Cancer is a major cause of death and suering. It con-
stitutes a group of diseases characterized by abnormal
cell growth, stage-wise progression, heterogeneity, and
potential to develop resistance to therapies. All these
aspects are consequences of the evolutionary nature of
cancer. Fortunately, genomics has recently begun to pro-
vide opportunities for unprecedentedly detailed insights
into tumour evolution. New techniques are presently
emerging for assaying the spatial distribution of tumour
heterogeneity, and future yet unforeseen experimental
breakthroughs are inevitable.
CONTRA (https://itn-contra.org) is a H2020 Marie-
Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network aimed at
providing a structured training programme to 15 Early
Stage Researchers (ESRs) to study tumor evolution us-
ing computational techniques upon novel experimental
data including, but not limited to, single-cell genomic
data. See the list of projects at the end of this message.
The training structure of CONTRA will include local
and network-wide activities and secondments to other
labs in the network. Most positions are for 3 years and
some for 4 years, contracts starting approximately July
1, 2018, but all of them lead to a PhD degree. Specic
conditions may apply to individual positions depending
on local regulations. Top-level graduates (master degreeFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 33
or equivalent) in bioinformatics, statistics, mathematics,
computer science or evolutionary biology are encouraged
to apply. No discrimination will be made on the basis
of nationality, gender, race, religion or disability.
H2020 EU funding imposes strict eligibility criteria. At
the time of recruitment the researcher must not have
resided or carried out his/her main activity (work, stud-
ies, etc) in the country of the host institute for more
than 12 months in the three years immediately prior to
his/her recruitment. The researcher should also be in
the rst four years of their research careers at the time
of recruitment by the host organisation and have not
been awarded a doctoral degree. The successful candi-
date will receive a very generous nancial package. The
exact conditions varies across the universities, but the
gross amounts of EU funding for an ESR is in the range
3710 euro -4210 euro . The net salary will result from
deducting all compulsory (employer/employee) social
security contributions as well as direct taxes from the
gross amounts, according to the law applicable to the
agreement concluded with the ESR. Some universities
will also supplement the EU funding. For details see
the EU Guide for applicants ( https://goo.gl/d6LtsE).

Ph.D. position in Experimental Evolution and Evolu-
tionary Genomics
A Ph.D. position is available in the Van de Peer Lab
in Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics (BEG),
VIB 'V Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium (http://-
bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/). The student will work on
an FWO funded project in collaboration with Olivier De
Clerck (Phycology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium).
The position is for three years (a one-year extension
might be possible) and is available immediately.
Project: Testing big evolutionary hypotheses with small
organisms - The eects of whole-genome duplication
(WGD) on plant evolution
Polyploids, organisms that underwent a WGD, possess
one or more extra copies of their genome, which has the
potential to facilitate the evolution of new functionality.
Many WGDs are accordingly found in very successful
eukaryotic lineages characterized by particular biolog-
ical innovations and/or diversications. However, the
acquisition of two complete genomes is generally not
well tolerated by cells, leading to harmful eects on
the overall tness and fertility of the organism. This
results in a paradox between the observed immediate
negative eects of WGDs, and their attributed long-
term positive eects. Phylogenomic dating of WGDs in
plants suggests that many polyploids became established
during times of environmental upheaval or extinctions.
Present-day polyploids are also often more abundant in
harsh environments such as the Arctic, which together
would suggest that environmental turmoil and stress
may enhance polyploid establishment, because their in-
creased genetic variation could potentially enable rapid
adaptive changes. To test this hypothesis, we are con-
ducting evolutionary experiments in unicellular green
algae (the model system Chlamydomonas), aiming to
gain novel insights into why and how polyploids can ob-
tain an evolutionary advantage over their non-polyploid
ancestors.
The project has two components. 1) Experimental evolu-
tion of algae to study the eects of stress and changingenvironmental conditions on the survival and estab-
lishment of polyploids. 2) Evolutionary genomics of
evolved algae using next-generation sequencing to corre-
late genomic and transcriptional dynamics with tness,
adaptation, and establishment.
Candidate' ^As Prole:
Candidates should have a Master' ^As degree (or equiva-
lent), a strong background in evolutionary biology, and
a keen interest and preferably experience in both em-
pirical research and bioinformatics. The student needs
to be dedicated to carrying out long-term multidisci-
plinary research which involves regular maintenance of
algal cultures, some molecular work, as well as evolu-
tionary genomic analyses. Basic knowledge of program-
ming/scripting and statistics is required. Fluent English
and good communication skills, oral and in writing, are
essential.
Application:

letter (max. 1 page) and contact information of two
referees, combined in a single PDF, to Dr. Eylem Ay-

LizardHybridZoneGenomics
A PhD position in hybrid-zone genomics of a legless
lizard (Anguis)
Deadline for expressions of interest: 16 February 2018
The HerpDiv Research Group (Vaclav Gvozdik's group)
at the Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Studenec, Czech
Academy of Sciences, is seeking a highly motivated
student who ideally holds (or will nish soon) MSc in
population genetics, mathematical biology, bioinformat-
ics or a related topic. The successful applicant will be
involved in a project focusing on population/landscape
genomics of the hybrid zone of a legless lizard (Anguis).
Project: Anguiomics: Genomic insights into the evolu-
tionary history and contact zones of slow-worm lizards
(Anguis)
The project will combine multidisciplinary techniques us-
ing three types of genomic data (phylo-, cyto-, and pop-
ulation) and GIS-based environmental niche modelling
in Anguis lizards. The rst two parts, phylogenomic in-
ference and cytogenomic characterization of the species
will be separate sub-projects. Within the announced
position, the successful applicant will be focusing on
genome-wide variation (reduced representation; ddRAD-
seq) at a population level across the secondary contact
zone of A. fragilis and A. colchica in two geographic re-
gions (central Europe and northern Balkans). This will
allow us to empirically assess levels of introgression and
estimate the strength of barriers maintaining divergence
between the species, and to compare the situation in the
two regions. We will further test association between
genomic variation and environmental parameters, poten-
tially identifying loci under selection by environmental
factors. This will allow us to assess if the two species
respond to environmental factors in a similar or dierent
way, and to understand the balance between endogenous
and exogenous selection acting in the contact zone.
The successful applicant will be enrolled in the PhD
program of the Masaryk University in Brno (MUNI),
Faculty of Science, Department of Botany and Zoology.
Employment and analytic work will be realized at the

PhD Position in applied evolutionary ecology Rapid evo-
lution in wild plants cultivated for ecosystem restoration
The Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group inthe Institute of Landscape Ecology at the University of
M unster (Germany) invites applications for a Doctoral
Research Position (salary scale 65% of 13 TVL, for 36
months).
We are seeking to ll a 3-year PhD position, part of
research project on rapid evolution in cultivation of
wild plants, which has been recently granted to Dr.
Anna Lampei Bucharova (currently at the University
of T ubingen, from spring 2018 at the University of
M unster) and Dr. Walter Durka (UFZ Halle). The
project focuses on evolution in cultivation. To provide
sucient amount of seeds for ecosystem restoration,
wild plants are cultivated in monocultures on specialized
farms. In Germany, this cultivation is region-specic.
Seeds of individual provenances are cultivated at many
farms around the country, and produced seeds are sold as
\Regionalsaatgut" for ecological restoration. However,
the conditions in cultivation strongly dier from the wild
and it is likely that plants adapt to cultivation (\cultiva-
tion syndrome") and consequently, lose their adaptation
to wild environment, resulting in negative impact on
restoration success. The successful candidate will work
with many species and investigate how common and how
large are the evolutionary changes during cultivation.
At the same time, the system is an excellent opportunity
to investigate fundamental evolutionary questions about
rapid evolution, evolutionary trade-os and parallelism
in evolution across large number of species and thus,
derive general patterns (in contrast to working with one
model species).
The core of the project is a set of common garden ex-
periments, complemented by molecular analysis. The
PhD student will be supervised by Dr. Anna Lam-
pei Bucharova, in cooperation with Prof. Oliver Boss-
dorf (University T ubingen). Further details can be ob-
tained from Dr. Anna Lampei Bucharova (anna.lampei-
bucharova@uni-tuebingen.de).
The University of M unster is a large vibrant univer-
sity hosting number of excellent scientic institution
and provides stimulating research environment. The
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group is led by
Prof. Norbert H olzel and works on various topics,

Napoli Italy PlanktonEvolution
Investigating the role of connectivity in plankton ecology
and evolution by genomics
The Stazione Zoologica of Napoli, Italy and Genoscope
in Evry, France propose a PhD internship to study how
the oceanic connectivity aects marine ecosystem di-
versity using environmental genomics approaches. A
master internship on related topics is also possible.
An enduring challenge is to comprehend how marine
plankton has developed and maintains its relatively
large diversity, characterized by a complex web of inter-
actions, while living in a largely unstructured environ-
ment. As the local composition of plankton communities
are controlled by ocean circulation and resource delivery,
together with organism acclimation and adaptation, un-
derstanding the relation between the local distribution
of species and the large scale oceanographic patterns
becomes crucial. At this regard, since the 1930s, the
hypothesis that everything is everywhere but the envi-
ronment selects has shaped theories of marine biogeogra-
phy, questioning the possibility of an actual endemicity
for plankton species. However, recent progresses in ge-
nomics allowed to acquire and to compare data from
dierent types of wild marine organisms at ocean scale.
In particular, genomics data from the expedition Tara
Oceans provide the possibility to address the questionof physical connectivity between organisms by ocean
circulation at DNA level.
In this project, with the student we will bring together
expertise in theoretical ecology, genomics and oceanog-
raphy to explore how the physical connectivity between
oceanic regions may contrast the stable coexistence of
many species, and favor the establishment of new species.
We will pay particular attention to the hypothesis that
on ecological time scales gyres and main current systems
do actually isolate the species into local populations. We
will develop and use models to test specic hypotheses
on plasticity, adaptation, micro-evolution, speciation
and collective processes.
The position will be held in Napoli, Italy with multiple
stays at Genoscope near Paris, France. Daniele Iudi-
cone, Reno Sanges and Olivier Jaillon will supervise this
work. Numerous interactions with other members of
Tara Oceans consortium are to be considered.
Ideal candidate will have a strong background in one or
several of following skills: oceanography, marine ecology,
numerical ecology, evolutionary genomics, comparative
genomics. The student work will be computational.
A desirable asset would be knowledge of the linux op-
erative system, a scripting language, sequencing and
functional genomics data and biological and bioinfor-
matics databases and tools.

PhD position: Metabolic costs of learning and memory
in a key pollinator Closing date: 7th Feb 2018
Application details: https://www.ndaphd.com/-

Eligibility: UK residency requirements apply, please
see here for full details: http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/-
documents/studentship-eligibility-pdf/ Investment in
cognitive traits, such as learning and memory, is ex-
pected to yield tness benets through better decision-
making, producing behavior that is ne-tuned to the
local environment. Yet the fact that animals vary in
their cognitive abilities, both between and within species,
suggests that such investment comes at a signicant cost.
We currently understand little about what these costs
are, because it is dicult to manipulate cognitive abil-
ities, and thus any relationship with other traits is by
nature correlational. In this project, we will capital-
ize upon recent developments in insect cognitive neu-
roscience to overcome this problem, using a uniquely
tractable experimental system (the bumblebee Bombus
terrestris). We will focus upon (1) metabolic costs of
investment in cognition (2) potential evolutionary trade-
os with immune function (3) impacts on life-history
variables. In the latter stages of the project, there will
be the opportunity for the student to develop further
research questions according to their interests, which
may include (but are not limited to) the use of transcrip-
tomics to understand the genomic basis for cognitive
investment.
The successful applicant will be based at Royal Hol-
loway University of London in the research group of
Dr. Elli Leadbeater (http://ellileadbeater.wixsite.com/-
insectcognition), and will be co-supervised by Dr. Steve
Portugal at Royal Holloway and Dr. Samraat Pawar at
our DTP partnership institution, Imperial College. The
project will capitalize upon excellent ERC-funded social
insect research facilities at Royal Holloway, including
indoor and outdoor apiaries, bee rearing rooms and a
dedicated cognition laboratory. The student will join
a large group of researchers interested in social insect
behaviour within our department, which provides an ex-
ceptionally stimuluating and collaborative environment
for the proposed research. Experimental work will in-
volve laboratory-based studies during both the summerFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 47

based eldwork during the summer months according
to the student's interests. Pre-application informal en-

FULLY FUNDED PHD STUDENTSHIP IN GE-
NOMICS (ROYAL VETERINARY COLLEGE, LON-
DON, UK)
Dr. Denis Larkin's group at the Royal Veterinary Col-
lege, University of London currently has a three year
fully funded PhD studentship position in animal ge-
nomics available for EU applicants. Applicants from
other countries please see conditions below.
Mammalian and avian chromosomes drastically dier
in structure and evolutionary stability. While avian
genomes tend to be small and structurally similar across
the majority of avian species, the mammalian genomes
are about three times larger and often dier in chro-
mosome structures even among closely related species.
This PhD programme will investigate the evolutionary
basis of this dierence and its implication on pheno-
typic diversity in the two animal classes. To achieve
this the student will rst develop and apply a novel
technique for a fast improvement of fragmented mam-
malian genomes to complete chromosome assemblies to
make them suitable for comparison with other genomes.
This part of the project will focus on several species
of neglected agricultural and biomedical importance.
The genome assemblies produced by PhD student will
then be combined with other genomes of suitable qual-
ity and compared to genomes from two phylogenetic
Classes: mammals and birds. The student will focus
on distribution of genomic features that are likely be
related to evolutionary stability of avian genomes and
structural dynamics of mammalian genomes. Among
other features these will include genes, transposable el-
ements, conserved non-coding sequences. The student
will test the hypothesis that distribution of these fea-tures contributes to stability and evolutionary dynamics
of animal genomes.
The student will join a vibrant research group with lots
of experience and expertise in comparative animal ge-
nomics and will have a chance to contribute to several
large international genomics projects led by Broad In-
stitute, Sanger Institute and the Ten thousand genomes
(G10K) community of scientists. They will obtain com-
plementary training in bioinformatics, wet lab tech-
niques and scientic presentations to develop skills for
a successful genomics-oriented career in biology.
Desirable requirements:
Experience in bioinformatics (analyzing large datasets,
programming, or data visualization). Experience in
genomics.
This is a three year fully funded studentship. It is open
to UK/EU applicants only. International students are
welcome to apply but must be able to pay the dierence
between UK/EU and international tuition fees.
The studentship will commence in October 2018.

CognitionAndBrainEvolution
PhD position in Ethology
at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University,
Sweden
Deadline for application: January 31, 2018.
A PhD position focused on cognitive evolution is avail-
able in Alexander Kotrschal's research group in the
Department of Zoology at Stockholm University. The
project uses the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) as a model
to comparatively and experimentally investigate the fac-
tors driving cognitive evolution. As such, the project
spans over multiple disciplines including eld collections,
articial selection, assays of behaviour and detailed tests
of cognitive ability, brain imaging and neural density es-
timations, and analyses of the genomic architecture that
orchestrates changes in brain anatomy and cognitive
ability.
The project will use both animals from wild populations
with known dierences in ecology, and from a selection
experiment. These animals will be subjected to relevant
assays of behaviour, brain anatomy and genomics. The
overall aim of the project is thus to increase our under-
standing of the evolutionary relationship between brainanatomy, cognitive ability and the genome.
The work will mostly be lab-oriented but includes at
least one trip to Trinidad. The project will require hard
work but at the same time provide excellent opportuni-
ties for personal initiatives and development towards a
successful academic career. An important task will be
to undertake laborious selection experiments followed
by the collection and analysis of complex data in a way
that controls for the setup of replicated articial selec-
tion designs. The project is undertaken in Trinidad and
in a brand new section of the large tropical freshwater
sh labs in the Department of Zoology with established
assays of brain anatomy, several dierent aspects of
cognitive abilities, swimming parameters, personality,
individual and collective behaviour, etc.
The successful candidate will be part of an international
team consisting of an Ethologist (Alexander Kotrschal,
Stockholm University), Evolutionary Biologist (David
Reznick, University of California & Trinidad), Genome
Biologist (Alison E. Wright, University of Sheeld),
and Information Technology researcher (Kristiaan Pel-
ckmans, Uppsla University) that investigate the evolu-
tion of cognition, brain anatomy and the genome using
state-of-the-art methods.
Qualication requirements
The applicant must have completed a research degree
(e.g. Master's or equivalent) within Ethology, Zoology,
Behavioural Ecology, Evolutionary Biology or a related
subject. We are looking in particular for candidates with
a strong interest in cognitive evolution, with excellent
analytical ability and experience from quantitative anal-
yses of behaviour and other traits of interest. Experience
in genomic analyses and working with aquatic animals
in the lab is not mandatory but especially meriting.

Project description: In this project, we will investigate
evolutionary processes at one of the rst discovered su-
pergenes, the distyly S-locus. We will conduct these
studies in Linum, where the dynamic nature of distyly
presents an outstanding opportunity to study supergene
evolution. To do so, we will rst generate multiple de
novo genome assemblies of Linum species, and then
use this genomic framework to comprehensively test hy-
potheses on the evolution and breakdown of the distyly
supergene.
The project will involve a large component of evolution-
ary genomic analyses. The student will also carry out
experimental plant work and some molecular genetic
lab work. There may be opportunities for eld trips in
the Mediterranean region.
Infrastructure and environment: The PhD student will
join a group of postdocs and PhD students led by Dr.
Tanja Slotte. For recent examples of our work, see e.g.
Laenen, Tedder et al. 2018 PNAS, Steige, Laenen et al.
2017 PNAS, or Steige et al. 2015 MBE. The PhD student
will be based in the Slotte lab (http://tanjaslottelab.se),
a part of the Dept. of Ecology, Environment and Plant
Science, Stockholm University.
We are located at the Science for Life Laboratory in
Stockholm (http://www.scilifelab.se), which holds con-
siderable expertise in high-throughput sequencing tech-
nology and bioinformatics. The working atmosphere is

UBath 3 Extinction
The Longrich Lab at the University of Bath, UK is cur-
rently seeking an outstanding PhD candidate to work
on a project investigating Diversity dynamics of inver-
tebrates over mass extinctions: recovery and radiation
Project Description
Mass extinctions both destroy, and create, biodiversity.
Fossils show that mass extinctions- rapid, global, and
severe events wiping out upwards of 50% of all species
on Earth- have repeatedly occurred, and yet diversity
inevitably recovers, or even increases, in the aftermath.
The K-Pg mass extinction is the most recent of the Big
Five events and therefore has the most complete record.
It can therefore serve as a model system and a starting
point for testing hypotheses, but any attempt to infer
universal patterns (or their absence) will require com-
paring the K-Pg both against other mass extinctions,
such as the E-O, Tr-J, and P-Tr events, and also periods
of background extinction.
The terrestrial record, in particular the demise of the
dinosaurs and the radiation of mammals, has been the
focus of intensive study, but the marine fossil record is
far more complete owing to the relatively continuous
deposition of marine sediments. Marine invertebrates
have hard, durable shells that promote preservation
and are therefore, excellent model organisms to study
macroevolutionary trends over mass extinctions. The
marine invertebrate record therefore provides our best
opportunity to understanding fundamental patterns of
extinction and recovery and to understand the role ofFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 51
mass extinction as a driver of macroevolution. Over
100 years of paleontological literature, and large-scale
databases and resources including the Palaeobiology
Database, Treatise of Invertebrate, and Compendium
of Fossil Marine Genera mean that a wealth of data are
available to test evolutionary hypotheses.
The project aims to test many scenarios of invertebrate
diversity dynamics over mass extinctions. This will be
achieved by taking a quantitative approach to exploring
the fossil record. Questions of interest include:
1. How severe are mass extinction events? Does im-
proved sampling of fossils tend to push estimates of
extinction up, or down over time? To what extent does
poor sampling of survivors exaggerate extinction rates,
and to what extent might poor sampling of victims
obscure it?
2. What separates survivors and victims? How do size,
ecology, geographic range, latitudinal distribution, and
rarity determine risk of extinction?
3. How rapid is the recovery of both taxic and func-
tional diversity? To what extent do survivors rell
previously occupied niches, or not? Does innovation in
the aftermath of extinction, facilitated by extinction of
incumbents potentially lead to a long-term increase in
total diversity? Are ecosystems fundamentally similar
before and after, with dierent actors lling the same
role, or has the script of the play somehow changed?
4. How does mass extinction aect biogeographic pat-
terns? Do mass extinctions tend to decrease or increase
endemicity in their aftermath? How are latitudinal gra-
dients aected by extinctions with a strong element of
climactic selectivity?
This PhD is fully funded for up to 4 years. Applicants
should have a strong research background; publications
and a masters degree are highly desirable. A background
in palaeontology is not necessary but students should
have a strong background in quantitative approaches to
science, including statistics and scripting. To help build
the group, we seek students who are hardworking, curi-
ous, creative, and collaborative. The project is part of
a 5-year research project to understand mass extinction
and recovery and your project is designed to result in
a series of signicant research papers and to train the
student to pursue a research career in palaeontology. If
applicants have any queries please contact Nick Longrich
(nrl22@bath.ac.uk). We will also assist students seeking
their own funding.
The student will be trained in quantitative ecological
and palaeontological methods, also with training in
management and collection of invertebrate fossil and
environmental data. We will develop your oral and writ-ten work and help you turn your science into academic
publications. You will also become part of the Univer-
sity of Baths Palaeontology Group which is young but
rapidly growing. We currently have three faculty mem-
bers, Dr. Nicholas Longrich, Professor Matt Wills and
Dr. Daniel Field, the palaeontology group is in turn a
central part of Baths new Milner Centre for Evolution, a
unique research centre focused on fundamental research
on major problems in evolutionary biology.

Dr John Welch, Dept of Genetics, jjw23@cam.ac.uk,
https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/directory/john-welch
Aims. The student will develop mechanistic models for
the evolution of AMR in bacterial pathogens, with a52 EvolDir February 1, 2018
specic focus on species relevant to the pig farming
industry (including Streptococcus suis, Salmonella
enterica and Escherichia coli). The models will be
validated using data from farm surveys and experiments
recently or currently conducted by the Department.
Both supervisors are investigators on existing grants
funded by the BBSRC and the MRC that cover sample
collection, AMR testing and genome sequencing.
Objectives.
(i) Develop a dynamic framework for the circulation of
bacterial species and mobile AMR genes within farms
in the absence of disease and treatment.
(ii) Estimate key parameters by tting models to ge-
nomic data from asymptomatic carriage.
(iii) Model selection pressures created by interspecic
competition and antibiotic treatment, within and be-
tween hosts, using data from clinical cases in pig farms
and experimental infections (collected as part of an
MRC grant).
(iv) Simulate alternative drug regimens and treatment
strategies (guided by veterinary expertise) that may
reduce or counter selection for AMR.
Learning opportunities. By bringing together mathemat-
ical modelling, bioinformatics and epidemiological data,
this project will ll a gap in the eld of bacterial evo-
lutionary epidemiology (lagging years behind research
on viral pathogens). With joint expertise from Restif
and Weinert (Vet Medicine) and Welch (Genetics), the
student will learn a variety of programming, statistical
and genomic skills at the cutting edge of science. The
student will benet from interactions with other mod-
elling experts within the Disease Dynamics Unit, as well
as microbiologists, veterinarians and geneticists.

Title: Metal tolerance and local adaptation in brown
trout in the mining areas of Cornwall and Wales
Supervised by Dr Jamie Stevens (Exeter -
j.r.stevens@exeter.ac.uk) and Professor Mike Bruford
(Cardi - brufordmw@cardi.ac.uk)
This project will uncover the basis of local adaptation
and resilience to environmental change in an economi-
cally important sh. It will use cutting-edge genomic,
bioinformatics and geospatial tools to ask how genomic
changes have enabled brown trout populations to adapt
to dierent and changing environmental conditions, in-
cluding pollution in three dierent regions: southwest
England, mid-Wales and southeast Ireland. Specically,
you will use genome sequencing to examine the roles of
colonisation, natural river conditions and metal pollu-
tion on patterns of diversity in the brown trout genome.
Your PhD will be based at Exeter and Cardi Univer-
sities and will involve collaboration and training with
local partners,
This is a novel project because whole genome
(re)sequencing has not yet been carried out in brown
trout or applied to its conservation and adaptation. This
PhD is now possible because a brown trout reference
genome will be produced as part of the Sanger Institute's
25 Genomes Project (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/news/-
view/25-species-revealed-25-genomes-project) in 2018.
Riverscape genomics is a very recent concept combining
genome-scale and environmental data in a geospatial
(GIS) context, where connectivity and gene ow can be
accurately assessed using genetic, environmental and
river management/engineering data. Evidence for lo-
cal adaptation in brown trout is widespread, as shown
by analysis of wild populations in a variety of dier-
ent habitats, and the often poor survival of stocked or
translocated sh and sh farm escapees. Adaptation to
metals (i.e. metal tolerance), river water temperature
during the egg phase, photoperiodicity and seasonal
timing of smoltication have all been reported. Brown
trout populations can survive (and thrive) in rivers in
very close proximity to disused-mine sites.

PhD position at the University of Greifswald, Zoological
Institute and Museum Application deadline: 19.01.2018
Thesis topic: Ecological drivers and genetic conse-
quences of range expansion in lesser horseshoe bats
The Zoological Institute and Museum at the University
of Greifswald invites applications for a PhD position
within the Research Training Group RESPONSE:
https://biologie.uni-greifswald.de/forschung/dfg-
graduiertenkollegs/research-training-group-2010/job-
oers/.
Starting date: April 1st 2018. Duration: 3 years. Salary:
German salary scale (TV-L 13, 65%).
*Background*: The European vertebrate fauna is highly
dynamic due to both historical climatic variation and
anthropogenic pressures. The ability of a species to
track climatic changes by range shift is expected to be a
major determinant of extinction risk (Science 313: 789).
For some species, such as the Palearctic bat species
*Rhinolophus hipposideros*, regressions and advances
are quite well documented and represent unique op-
portunities to study how and why range limits move.
Such dynamic range boundaries can be observed at the
Northern edge of the current distribution of *R. hip-
posideros*, regions in which models of climate change
predict a northward progression of this species during
the next decades (Global Change Biol. 16: 561). Here
we will investigate colonisation and colony formation
via dispersal in the focal species, study trade-os / as-
sociations between dispersal and life history traits, and
elucidate factors inuencing dispersal, paying special
attention to social and environmental factors.
*Goals of the projects*: Interconnected wild colonies at
the Northern edge of the species' range will be surveyedin Germany and combined with data already obtained
from France (via associated partner E. Petit). Droppings
will be collected from all colonies and genotyped using
available microsatellite loci (protocol already optimised),
allowing for individual identication and pedigree re-
construction. Non-invasive genotyping over consecutive
years in the colony networks will be used to estimate de-
mographic parameters (i.e. population size, population
growth, vital [births, deaths] and dispersal [emigrations,
immigrations] rates). Temperature and humidity will be
monitored throughout the year within and outside the
colonies, and habitat characteristics around the colonies
will be mapped (Corine Land Cover). The project will
focus on associations between realised dispersal and re-
productive rate as well as on the inuence of population
density, social and environmental factors on dispersal
and colony formation. The obtained results will be
used to parametrize a hybrid correlative/mechanistic
model to predict range expansion in the species. This
study will be carried out in collaboration with local
conservation agencies and Dr. E. Petit, INRA (Rennes,
France).
Required skills: §The candidate should have (or at
least be willing to develop) skills in population dynam-
ics and population genetics, landscape ecology, man-
agement/treatment of geo-referenced databases (GIS),
§Good writing skills (in English; this is very important),
§Good knowledge of German (speaking; required for the

*Supervisors: *Prof. Dr. Gerald Kerth & Dr. Caroline
Sch oner, Applied Zoology and Conservation
*Thesis topic: *Relative importance of genetic and plas-
tic responses to adverse weather conditions in long-lived
bats.
*Background: *Recent studies have reported decreasing
body size as a response to climate change in various
taxa (*Nat. Clim. Change 1: 401*). As body size and
fecundity are often positively correlated, shrinking body
size may lead to higher extinction risk. Interestingly, in
a few species increasing body size in response to climate
change has been observed, which may occur if warm
weather is required for growth. However, the tness
implications of such poorly documented trends are un-
clear. Bats are particularly interesting for studying the
potential impact of climate change on individual tness
and ultimately on population persistence, as bats are
long-lived, of high conservation concern and as they
show behaviours that allow them to cope with weather
variation, such as social thermoregulation, torpor, and
roost switching.
*Goals of the projects: *This project aims at assessing
to which tness-relevant responses to adverse weather
conditions are caused by genetic factors or phenotypic
plasticity, and whether the relative impact of genetic
versus plastic responses depends on local conditions or
the respective species. Existing eld and genetic data ofup to 25 years will be combined with new (experimen-
tal) data collected during the project period to quantify
the inuence of weather conditions on the behaviour,
morphology, reproductive success and/or survival of
four bat species (*M. bechsteinii*, *M. daubentonii, M.
nattereri*, *Plecotus auritus*). Multigenerational fam-
ily pedigrees will allow us to measure the heritability
of body size and other potential tness relevant traits
such as departure timing from the hibernaculum or age
at rst reproduction, using parent-ospring regression
and animal models. We will test whether behavioural,
demographic and morphological responses to varying
weather conditions dier between syntopic bat species.
We will also analyse to which extent local environmen-
tal conditions and social factors inuence the tness
consequences of the observed responses to weather con-
ditions. The relative importance of larger body size in
response to increasing temperature, roosting behaviour
and social factors (e.g. position in the social network)
on tness (survival, reproductive success) will be inves-
tigated together with local partners within RESPONSE
and associated partners from the Max-Planck-Institute
for Demographic Research in Rostock.
*Required skills: *
- - Strong background in behavioral and evolutionary
ecology - - Knowledge of statistics, data handling and
graphics in R - - Expertise with databases such as
mySQL - - Basic knowledge in modelling and computer
simulations - - Profound knowledge of English (speaking

of the INTERREG SEEWANDEL research initiative,
which includes seven institutions in Switzerland, Ger-
many, and Austria and seeks to investigate the eects
of environmental change on biodiversity and resilience
in Lake Constance and other large peri-Alpine lakes.
The position is funded for 48 months and to be lled
at the earliest possible date. The successful candidate
will be based at the Molecular Ecology Group at the
Institute of Ecology of the University of Innsbruck which
is highly interdisciplinary and internationally very well

resting eggs from sediment cores to quantify and char-
acterize gene ow between species and study the con-
sequences of the secondary contact on species integrity
and functional traits. The project comprises sedimento-
logical work (collecting sediment cores), molecular lab
work (DNA extractions and library preparation), and
extensive bioinformatics analyses as well as some exper-

three large peri-Alpine lakes with dierent trophic his-
tories - Lake Constance, Lake Walen, and Lake Zurich -
and will include close collaborations with the members of
the SEEWANDEL initiative. Part of the experimental
work will be conducted at Eawag (Switzerland).
Candidates should be highly motivated and have a
strong interest in evolutionary biology, ecology, and

PhD position on the 'Impact of the microbiome on
Drosophila cold tolerance'
Microbial symbionts represent major sources of evolu-
tionary innovation by providing novel ecological traits to
their hosts. While the impact of bacterial mutualists on
the interaction of insects with their biotic environment
(antagonists, diet, etc.) has received increasing atten-
tion over the past decades, the importance of microbial
symbionts for the adaptation to abiotic conditions re-
mains poorly understood. Preliminary data indicate
that microbes associated with Drosophila can improve
the y's cold tolerance in a diet-dependent manner. We
oer a 3-year PhD position (65% TV-L EG13) in the
group of Dr. Martin Kaltenpoth at the JGU Mainz
to investigate (i) which microbial taxa that are natu-
rally associated with fruit ies enhance cold tolerance,
(ii) how they do so on the mechanistic level, and (iii)
whether these eects are ecologically relevant.
The project will be embedded into the project con-
sortium on \Seasonal temperature acclimation in
Drosophila" (headed by Suzanne Eaton at the Technical
University in Dresden), which is funded by the German
Science Foundation (DFG). The interdisciplinary consor-
tium includes experts in molecular biology, biochemistry,
biophysics, mass spectrometry, epigenetics, evolutionary
biology, and ecology, who will closely collaborate to gain
a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that
allow Drosophila to acclimate and adapt to dierent cli-
matic conditions. The PhD candidate will benet from
the integration into the consortium by regular meetings,
workshops, retreats, and the exchange of methodological
expertise.
We are looking for a highly motivated student with an
MSc degree in evolutionary biology, ecology, or molecu-
lar biology (or equivalent), excellent English speaking
and writing skills and a deep interest in the evolutionary
ecology of insect-microbe interactions. Previous experi-
ence with insect rearing, microbiology, molecular biology,
and/or bioinformatics techniques are of advantage.

2 PhD positions: Niche construction and evolutionary
capacitance in the red our beetle
We invite applications for two PhD positions to study

red our beetle Tribolium castaneum. The positions are
available for three years at the Institute for Evolution
and Biodiversity at the University of M ~A^A1
4nster in58 EvolDir February 1, 2018
Germany. They are part of the recently funded collabo-
rative research centre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled: A Novel
Synthesis of Individualisation across Behaviour, Ecol-
ogy and Evolution: Niche Choice, Niche Conformance,
Niche Construction (NC3), as granted by the German
Research Foundation (DFG).
The start date is from February 1st 2018 or soon there-
after.
Within the rst project, the interested candidate will
experimentally study how our beetles modify the mi-
crobial community of their environment, the our. This
form of niche construction is mediated by chemical se-
cretions of the beetles. The project will test for the role
of prior immunological experience of individuals, and
analyse its long-term evolutionary consequences, using
experimental evolution. The chemical ecology as well
as the genetic underpinnings of the evolved phenotypes
will be studied.
Within the second project, the interested candidate will
experimentally study how cryptic genetic variation is
stored and released in the red our beetle, and how this
process of evolutionary capacitance may speed up evolu-
tionary adaptation. The project will in particular focus
on the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the
eect of immunological experience of group members
on this process. Long-term evolutionary consequences
will be studied with experimental evolution, and the
genomic consequences will be analysed.

We are looking for a highly motivated PhD stu-

ticity in wing development in waterstriders in
collaboration with Prof. Abderahman Khila at
IGFL, Lyon (http://ig.ens-lyon.fr/equipes/a.-khila-
developmental-genomics-and-evolution).
Phenotypic plasticity is one of the main mechanisms by
which plants and animals adapt to changing environmen-
tal conditions and thus of major evolutionary interest.
This project will combine eldwork, lab experiments
and genomic work (crosses, RNA seq, RNAi) to study
how temperature and photoperiod inuence plasticity
in wing development in dierent species of waterstriders.
Waterstriders are a well known group of insects display-
ing wing polymorphism both between species as well
as within species in response to the environment (e.g.
J arvinen & Veps al ainen1976. Hereditas, 84, 61-68) and
are also model species in evolutionary biological studies
(Rowe et al. 1994. TREE, 9, 289-293). Several species of
waterstriders will be collected in early summer 2018 and
nymphs raised in the lab under dierent photoperiod
and temperature regimes followed by RNA seq analyses
to identify dierentially expressed genes between apter-
ous (wingless) and macropterous/brachypterous morphs.
Functional work will be done using established RNAi
protocols developed for waterstriders (Khila et al. 2012
Science 336, 585-589).
The overall goal is to identify the genetic variants re-
sponsible for wing development and their interaction
with temperature and photoperiod but there are several
lines to examine depending on the candidate interests
and qualications.
We are looking for candidates with a strong interest in
evolutionary developmental biology and evolutionary
genetics, with excellent analytical ability and experi-
ence in the analyses of life history traits. Experience in
working with aquatic animals in the lab is meriting.
The venue for the position, the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre, is situated in central Uppsala (http://-
www.ieg.uu.se). The working atmosphere is highly inter-
national with a regular recruitment of PhD students and
post-docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes an excit-

graduate students, and with research programs in, for
example, ecology, genetics, genomics and developmental
biology. Our graduate school oers a creative and stimu-

journal clubs, courses and possibilities to interact with
other scholars and students. Local platforms for next-

methods, next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic
approaches to answer fundamental questions in evo-

lab are:
§How do humans inuence the evolution of wildlife? We
study the ways in which climate change, habitat alter-
ation, and introduced diseases impact the distribution of
genetic variation, rates of gene ow, and the probability
of adaptation.
§What is the genomic basis of rapid adaptation to novel
pathogens? We examine the demographic and environ-
mental constraints to adaptation and whether genomic
architecture of rapid adaptation diers from that of

USussex PlantGenomeEvolution
PhD Studentship Subject area: Plant genome evolution
and epigenetics University of Sussex
Project title: Evolutionary and epigenetic interactions
between transposable elements and their plant hosts
A Ph.D. studentship (42 months) is available from
September 2018 under the supervision of Dr. Alexandros
Bousios, in the Evolution, Behaviour and Environment
Group, School of Life Sciences.
Deadline: 4th February 2018
The Bousios lab is looking for a PhD student to study
the impact of transposable elements (TEs) in the func-
tion and evolution of plant genomes. TEs represent the
most abundant component of eukaryotic genomes, and
especially in plants they can occupy up to 80-90% of
their genomic content. TE activity can be deleterious
for the host, because it can cause chromosomes to break
or because new copies can insert within genes and dis-
rupt their function. As a result, hosts have developed
epigenetic defence mechanisms to suppress TE activity,
although given the abundance of TEs, these mechanisms
are not always successful.
By focusing on maize but also other fully-sequenced
plant genomes, and mostly using bioinformatics ap-
proaches, the candidate will attempt to shed light on
the very rst steps of TE silencing, i.e. how epigenetic
defences recognize the mRNA of active TEs. It is hy-
pothesized that specic regions on the TE may play
a crucial role in the recognition process, and, hence,
are the foci of an ongoing evolutionary battle between
TEs and hosts. In addition, the candidate will study
the extent to which TEs positively inuence host gene
function, by lending some of their sequences to the host
regulatory system. This process, known as TE exapta-
tion or co-option, is poorly understood in plants.

Dear Colleagues,
We are advertising a fully-funded PhD position on the
evolution of sexual conict in Drosophila melanogaster,
based at the Cavanilles Institute of Biodiversity and
Evolutionary Biology (University of Valencia, Spain).
Please see attached for further details.
Best wishes,
Pau

Cavanilles of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology
University of Valencia Tel: +34 963544051 http://-paucarazo.com PhD Student- Evolution of male-male
competition and sexual conict
What do we oer? We oer a 4-year PhD fellowship
starting on September 2018 to January 2019.
To do what? We are looking for a PhD student interested
in studying the evolutionary factors modulating the in-
tensity of male-male competition and sexual conict,
and its consequences in terms of population viability.
Strong sexual selection can improve population viability
and evolvability through a number of processes, such as
genetic capture. However, strong sexual selection will
also often give rise to sexual conict and female harm,
which does not only tend to deviate females from their
evolutionary optima, but can drastically aect popula-
tion viability, leading to a \reproductive tragedy of the
commons". We are still far from understanding what
factors modulate the evolution of male-male competi-
tion, female harm levels, and sexual conict at large,
and how this all feeds back into population viability.
Our on-going research aims to contribute to ll these
gaps in knowledge by investigating factors potentially
modulating the evolution of sexual conict. For example,
we are currently investigating the role of kin selection in
leading to reproductive cooperation (or \reproductive
altruism"), how temperature aects male- male com-
petition levels and the potential for sexual conict, or
the evolutionary interplay between ageing and sexual
selection (e.g. can ageing magnify sexual conict?).
The research project mainly involves behavioural experi-
ments and lab work with Drosophila melanogaster, some
experimental evolution, and some eldwork in Europe,
the USA and potentially in Australia.
Where? The student will be supervised by Dr. Pau
Carazo, and based at the Behaviour and Evolution
group of the Ethology Lab, at the Cavanilles institute
of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology (University of
Valencia, Spain). For information about our group visit
our website (http://paucarazo.com).
Who? We are looking for a motivated, enthusiastic,
hard-working candidate with some background (and a
strong interest) in sexual selection, and evolutionary
biology and animal behaviour at large.
Contact For further information and expressions of inter-
est, please contact Pau Carazo (University of Valencia;

# Research areas
## Evolution of HIV-1 within hosts.
Despite the availability of highly eective drug treat-ments, HIV-1 establishes a life-long chronic infection
for which we have yet to develop a cure. When HIV-1
infects a cell, it integrates itself into the host genome
and, in some cases, enters a dormant state where it
becomes invisible to the immune system. This creates
a long-lived reservoir of \latently" infected cells that
is the main barrier to a cure. We are developing new
phylogenetic methods to reconstruct how this rapidly-
evolving virus spreads through the body and to identify
potential targets to eradicate the virus reservoir.
## Detecting transmission outbreaks.
For infectious diseases, a genetic cluster is a subset of in-
fections that have barely accumulated any genetic dier-
ences since their recent descent from a common ancestor.
Clustering has become a popular method for rapidly
screening clinical databases for potential transmission
outbreaks. Based on recent work, we now know that
clustering methods can be badly confounded by when
the infections were sampled from the population. We
are developing and validating a new approach inspired
by speciation models to detect lineage-specic shifts in
branching rates, and working with global partners to de-
velop open-source monitoring systems to support public
health eorts in real time while protecting individual
privacy.
# Training environment
The Poon lab is an entirely \dry" research computing
and open-source software development group (http:/-
/github.com/PoonLab). The lab is housed in a newly
renovated space in the Department of Pathology, and
equipped with custom-built Linux workstations, a small
high-performance computing cluster and an espresso
machine. My lab mostly runs on Python, R and LaTeX
{ my objective is to enable all my trainees develop a
working knowledge of all three languages.
Western University is one of Canada's top research-
intensive universities, and home to the Western HIV
Investigators Group (WHIG), a highly collaborative
team of 8 principal investigators with diverse and com-
plementary research programs, including evolution and
pathogenesis (Dr. Eric Arts), natural resistance and
host microbiomes (Dr. Jessica Prodger), and bioinfor-
matics and phylogenetics (Dr. Poon). The adjacent
London Regional Genomics Centre provides state-of-
the-art next- generation sequencing services on Illumina
MiSeq and NextSeq systems.

The Institut Jacques Monod (IJM), a leading center of
fundamental biological research in Paris, is seeking to
appoint several new group leaders. The IJM is com-
prised of about 30 research groups working in the elds
of genetics and genomics, biophysics, cell biology, devel-
opment and evolution.
Candidates should work in one of the areas of funda-
mental biology covered by the Institute. Researchers
interested in computational biology and/or functional
genomics are particularly encouraged to apply. The
successful applicants will be selected based on their sci-
entic excellence and their potential to complement and
synergize with existing research in the Institute. We will
consider group leader applications at both the junior
and senior levels.
Research at the IJM is supported by excellent core
facilities providing state-of-the-art light and electron
microscopy, mass spectrometry, animal facilities, and
access to high throughput genomics equipment. The
IJM is located in Paris on the campus of the Universit e
Paris-Diderot and is aliated with the Centre National
de la Recherche Scientique (CNRS). For more detailed
information, visit our website (http://www.ijm.fr ).
Successful applicants should have upon their arrival at
IJM a permanent position with the CNRS, INSERM,
the French university system, or a non-permanent po-
sition funded by granting agencies such as the French
ATIP-AVENIR program or the ERC, which will allow
them to apply for a permanent position.

The Department of Biology wishes to strengthen re-
search and teaching at the interface between plant com-
munity ecology and evolutionary biology, with a focus
on terrestrial plants. We are advertising a fully tenured
position which will include both teaching and research.
The Biology Department in Lund is a large and interna-
tionally visible department, has excellent facilities and
is a good working place!
There is currently a strong interest in extending studies
of evolutionary processes beyond single organisms, or
interactions between a small number of organisms, to a
more realistic community-based context. Rapid develop-
ments within genomics provide increasingly accessible
means of characterizing molecular variation with plant
communities - and these developments are driving a
closer integration of ecological and evolutionary studies.
We want to appoint a person with strong competence
within the eld of terrestrial plant community ecology
and a focus on the ecological and evolutionary processes
that drive community assembly and biodiversity. Expe-
rience in eld-based teaching in oristics and vegetation
analysis will be regarded as a strong merit.

We are recruiting a talented statistical geneti-
cist/bioinformatician with excellent communication
skills to determine the genetic basis of complex phe-
notypes in rice and chickpea, with the aim of improving
these important crops. The methodologies developed by
the project will apply to many other crops and animals.
The post is funded by the UK Global Challenges Re-
search Fund and the BBSRC. The post-holder will join
the group of Richard Mott in the Genetics Institute
(UGI) at University College London (UCL), and will
work in close collaboration with the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, and the Interna-
tional Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Trop-
ics (ICRISAT), India, and the National Institute for
Agricultural Botany (NIAB), Cambridge. The project
will involve visits to both IRRI and ICRISAT.
The project focuses on (i) the imputation of genome se-
quence from crop populations sequenced at low coverage,
adapting methods developed previously in the group
(e.g. Davies et al Nature Genetics 2015) (ii) the use
of low-coverage population sequence to identify struc-
tural variants implicated in phenotypes (Imprialou et
al Genetics 2017) (iii) The development and implemen-
tation of quantitative genetics and genomic prediction
methods in crop development, particularly in relation
to multiparental advanced intercrosses (MAGIC popula-
tions. (iv) Close collaboration, support and knowledge
exchange with partner laboratories.
Applicants must have a PhD in Statistical Genetics,
Bioinformatics or a related eld, and a good under-

Evolutionary and Behavioural Genomics of Cichlid Spe-

Context :
Since Darwins' \The Origin of Species" there has been a
continued interest to gain insight in the speciation pro-
cess. Initially, theories on speciation were mostly narra-February 1, 2018 EvolDir 87
tive and focussed on the geographic modes of speciation,
while more recent work investigated the importance of
sexual selection or whether speciation rates can be trig-
gered by environmental changes. All these questions
have been addressed in the cichlid shes from the Great
African lakes that are often cited as the ultimate animal
models to investigate adaptive radiation and speciation.
To date, recently developed techniques that allow ex-
ploring genomic evolutionary issues in cichlids have for
the most part been used to link genes with the observed
phenotypic changes that are so characteristic in the
African cichlid species ocks. In contrast, we propose to
make use of the opportunities oered by the availability
of these novel techniques to investigate the genetic basis
of the speciation process itself. Therefore, our two main
objectives are to characterize the genomic dierentia-
tion that drives the speciation process, and to verify
whether/and to what extent the same genomic changes
are involved in to maintain the ???????integrity' of the
gene pools of the resulting sister species.

170 million NOK (about 55 externally funded research
projects). CEES successfully completed its 10 year sta-
tus of Centre of Excellence (CoE) in 2017 and is chaired
by Professor Nils Chr. Stenseth.
Two researcher positions, one in Evolutionary biology
and one in Applied mathematics are available at the Cen-
tre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES),
Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Mathematics and
Natural Sciences.
The positions is for a period of two years, with thepossibilities of extension. The appointed candidates
will be working on the project \Drivers of evolutionary
change: understanding stasis and non-stasis through
integration of micro- and macroevolution", which is
funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN)
(there will be no compulsory teaching). The PI of
the project is Nils Chr. Stenseth (University of Oslo:
www.cees.uio.no/stenseth); co-PIs are Jan Martin Nord-
botten (University of Bergen: http://www.uib.no/-
personer/Jan.Martin.Nordbotten), Indr e~Aliobait e(Uni-
versity of Helsinki: http://www.zliobaite.com/) and

will have CEES as their home base, but the appointed
candidates will be expected to spend time in Bergen
and Helsinki.
RESEARCH PROJECT
The primary objective of the funded project is to un-
derstand to what extent macroevolutionary patterns
and changes can be understood as resulting from mi-
croevolutionary and ecological processes. By so doing
the project aims at bringing together micro- and macro-
evolutionary theories. A main objective of the project
is to develop common ground between mathematical
formulations and biological denitions by developing
data proxies and linking them to models. A description
of the project can be obtained on request.
POSITION 1 (EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY): To ll
one of the opened positions we are seeking a person with
solid background in evolutionary biology. Candidates
with experience in statistical modelling, computational
analysis and/or integration of data-driven analysis with
mathematical models of ecological and/or evolutionary
processes will be prioritized.
POSITION 2 (APPLIED MATHEMATICS): To ll the
other opened position we are seeking a person with solid
background in applied mathematics. Candidates with
experience from multi-scale methods, analysis of partial
dierential equations, and/or scientic computing will
be prioritized. Previous experience from mathematical
biology is not necessary, but will be advantageous.
The two appointed candidates will be working as a
team together with other members of the project. For
this purpose we seek highly motivated and enthusiastic
persons interested in working in interdisciplinary teams.
REQUIREMENTS
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has
a strategic ambition of being a leading research faculty.

3Dprinting magneticStand
Dear EvolDir community,
I would love to nd out if any of you use magnetic stands
for eppendorfs and pcr tubes? I know one needs to use
them for e.g. RNA library prep, but the stands are
ridiculously expensive . . . Did anyone try to print it
with a 3D printer? If so, details on price, any potential
3D models etc. would be much appreciated. Also, how
strong should the magnets be?
Looking forward to hearing from you all! All the best
in 2018! :) All answers will naturally be shown later on,
to help peer with similar issues.
Sincerely, Nik (lupsen@natur.cuni.cz)

magnetic stands are essential for library preps, the prices

Hi Nik,
I needed a 96 well magnetic plate and refused to pay
$300 for one.
I made one using a plastic 96 well plate for 0.2 mL PCR
tubes like this one (https://www.usascientic.com/-
Compact-PCR-tube-rack.aspx). I then used a drill
press to drill holes at the center of each cluster
of four wells (four holes in every-other row in the
plate). I inserted cylindrical magnets into the holes
like these (http://appliedmagnets.com/n48-neodymium-
magnets-1-8-in-x-1-2-in-cylind er-p-723.html).
The resulting plate worked great and cost about $10 to
make. You could extend this idea to any style of plasticrack.
Good luck!

the instructions of the designer (acadey). We did
this in 2014 and at the time, we paid for both stands
with the magnets cost plus assembly plus shipping, so
everything, around 400 euros. And I agree, commercial
stands are ridiculously expensive for a piece of plastic.
I hope this information helps! Dafni

of your friends for their broken headphones (or collect

Geum Primula RequestForSamples
Hello,
We need samples of two perennial wildowers, the wood
avens /Geum urbanum /(Fam. /Rosaceae/) and the
oxlip /Primula elatior/ (Fam. /Primulaceae/). These
species, common in most of Europe and parts of Asia,
grow in damp shady habitat; they can be found in
broadleaf woodlands and near/in hedgerows. Regarding
the sampling protocol, this is simple. We only need
one individual sampled per population. A population
is here dened as any isolated individual or cluster of
individuals which are distant of about 10m from the
next isolated or cluster of individuals. To sample a
population, just collect the 5 to 10 youngest leaves of
a single rosette (individual) of /G. urbanum vs. P. ela-
tior/ within the population. Collect only safe leaves
(no hole or sign of herbivory, no chlorosis or virus at-
tack). Put the fresh leaves in an envelope (standard
small paper envelope) with GPS coordinates of that
population written on the envelope or at least the nameFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 101
of the locality but lat/long coordinates is the best (one
enveloppe per population). If you could then collect
several populations (15 would be ideal, so 15 envelopes
total) from the same forest patch but which are not too
close from each others (cf. populations >10m away),
this would be optimal. The idea is to collect several
(when available) populations from a given forest patch
so that the sample is representative of the sampled forest
patch. For hedgerows (linear sampling) and especially
for /G. urbanum/ which is most common and abundant
than /P. elatior/, sampling can be done every 50m.
When nished, please put all collected populations from
the sampled forest patch or hedge (cf. all envelopes with
coordinates written on it) in another bigger envelope
and send it to this address:

Collaborators
Dear Evoldir community:
We are seeking collaborators to participate in the Global
Urban Evolution (GLUE) Project, a large-scale study
that seeks to understand whether urbanization drives
parallel evolution in cities throughout the world. This
project focuses on a single species (white clover, Tri-
folium repens), which is common in temperate envi-
ronments globally. It is one of the few species where
one could study the eects of urbanization on every
inhabited continent.
We are inviting individuals subscribing to this list-serve
to participate as collaborators on the project. You can
learn more about the project, including what is involved
for collaborators at www.globalurbanevolution.com.
You can also nd on this website whether your pre-
ferred city is already being sampled.Please let us know if you have any questions about
GLUE and how to get involved.

Hi, all 'V
In an eort to make genome-scale data resulting from
the recent new assembly of the Hydra vulgaris genome
widely and easily available, we are pleased to announce
the launch of the Hydra 2.0 Genome Project Portal,
available at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/hydra . The
web site features a customized, interactive genome
browser that allows users to visualize multiple data
sets at the same time, greatly facilitating the analysis of
the genome. Users also have the ability to run BLAST
searches against the Hydra genome, download complete
sets of Hydra sequence data, and view individual gene
wiki pages that contain additional information on each
gene model. Transcriptomic data have also been pro-
vided by the laboratories of Celina Juliano (University
of California, Davis) and Thomas Holstein (Centre for
Organismal Studies, Heidelberg University), for down-
load or visualization through the genome browser. In
addition, a growing collection of in situ hybridization
images are being added to individual gene pages, and we
encourage members of the Hydra community to submit
their own in situ images for inclusion on the site.
We hope that the availability of these data will be help-
ful to everyone with an interest in cnidarian biology,
and we certainly welcome any comments or feedback
you have regarding the site.

My name is Hari Sridhar and I'm a post-doctoral re-
searcher at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian
Institute of Science. Since early 2016, I have been
conducting a series of interviews of ecologists and evo-
lutionary biologists. In each interview, I revisit an old
\well-known" paper in ecology/evolution/behavior, with
the primary author, to nd out about 1. the making of
the paper 2. the impact the paper had on the author's
career and research and 3. the author's current stand
on what was said in the paper. The idea is to construct,
what one might call, 'shadow papers', which capture the
past and future of the original published articles. This is
an ongoing project, and I will post new interviews as and
when they are ready. The interviews are now all avail-
able at https://reectionsonpaperspast.wordpress.com/

On the need for phylogenetic natural history Josef Uyeda
(Virginia Tech) Friday, February 23, 2018, 9:00 AM PST
The availability of phylogenetic trees based on molecular
sequence data has revolutionized evolutionary biology
by providing a map from which we can understand
divergence and diversication across the tree of life.
Numerous phylogenetic comparative approaches have
opened up new avenues for testing macroevolutionary
hypotheses regarding the drivers of the tempo and mode
of trait evolution and lineage diversication. However,
recent crises in the eld have suggested that many of the
methods we commonly use don't tell us what we would
like them to. Specically, I will show that unreplicated
evolutionary events can break nearly every comparative
method for testing associations from phylogenetically
structured data. I will argue that one solution to this
problem is to unite hypothesis testing with data-driven
approaches, which I term \phylogenetic natural history",
to disentangle the impact of singular shifts from repli-
cated patterns of association. More generally, I will
argue that we should abandon thinking of phylogenetic
comparative methods as \corrections for statistical non-
independence" and more meaningfully confront how our
causal hypotheses map on to phylogenetically structured
data.

Applications of phylogenetic continuous trait models to

Wednesday, January 17, 2018, 10:00 AM PST
Historically, quantitative genetics was developed to un-
derstand macroscopic phenotypes, such as body mass.February 1, 2018 EvolDir 105
However, with the advent of high throughput genomics
technology, we now have access to extremely high dimen-
sional molecular phenotypes. One of the most common
traits analyzed is gene expression, measured via RNA
sequencing in modern applications. I will attempt to
put this work in historical context, highlighting some
early work on building models of neutral gene expression
evolution, which poses unique challenges in a phyloge-
netic comparative framework. I will also discuss some
work, including my own, that attempts to leverage the
dimensionality of gene expression data to increase power.
Finally, I will conclude with some perspectives on fu-
ture directions for analysis of molecular phenotypes in
a phylogenetic context.

NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
in Plant Ecology and Genomics
We anticipate having funding for one or two enthusiastic
students interested in enhancing their research skills
and experience in plant ecology, genomics, and bioinfor-
matics in the Cruzan lab at Portland State University
in Portland, Oregon.
Successful applicants will become part of a research team
working on dispersal and gene ow in upland prairie
plants in Oregon and Washington under pressure from
climate change. Dispersal is critical for colonization,
gene ow, and range expansion 'V it is one of the most
important but least understood aspects of the ecology
of plants. Our research utilizes genomic techniques to
detect the eects of dispersal over dierent spatial scales.
This is an integrative research program that includes
eld work, wet lab preparation of genomic DNA for
next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics processing
of sequence data, and analysis of patterns of gene ow
using GIS and landscape genetic methods. Students
will be exposed to a wide range of methods and are
expected to develop an independent research project
within the scope of the larger research program. More
information on our research is posted on our lab web
site: https://cruzanlab.weebly.com/ . Students will be
fully supported for 10 to 12 weeks during the summer of2018. Funding is provided from an REU supplement to
our National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology
grant. Housing will be provided on campus along with
a daily allowance for food and a $500 weekly stipend.
The start of the REU is negotiable with optimal start
dates between May 1 and June 17.
To apply please email us an updated copy of your CV
(including GPA) and a short (one page) statement of
your research interests and experience, as well as goals
for your education and career. Applicants should ar-
range to have one or two faculty members provide a
letter of recommendation (email is ne). Students with
experience in computer programming and/or bioinfor-
matics are encouraged to apply. Application deadline is
29 February 2016. Feel free to email us with questions.

Two interns will begin Apr 10, 2018 and two will begin
May 1, 2018. All four internships will nish on Aug 31,
2018. The project investigates the ecology of Columbian
ground squirrels. As a member of the study, interns
will be involved with monitoring the phenology (when
animals emerge from hibernation), reproduction and sur-
vival of individuals. Fieldwork will involve live-trapping
and handling of animals, radio-telemetry, behavioural
observation and assistance with the measurement of
physiological (metabolism) traits on free-ranging ani-
mals. This is an excellent opportunity to gain training
and experience working with a collaborative research
team on a long-term study of a wild mammal. Op-
portunities for independent research projects are also
available.
All eldwork is carried out in the spectacular Rocky
Mountains of southwestern Alberta, Canada, home to
some of the most majestic wildlife in North America.106 EvolDir February 1, 2018
Interns will have the opportunity to interact with, and
learn from, other researchers working with ground squir-
rels on a diversity of projects in behavioural and popula-
tion ecology. Additionally, a number of other researchers
in the area are studying a range of species, from insects
to large mammals.
International applicants: If applicants are not Cana-
dians or permanent residents, they will be required

lead to ongoing outreach collaboration in future years.
Preference will be given to new collaborations, but exten-
sions of previous projects that have evidence of success
are allowed. *Proposals will be accepted until January
25, 2018.*
Guidelines for applying for funds to support SSE 2018
outreach projects are as follows:
1. Proposal: Clearly but briey state your plans in NO
MORE THAN one single-spaced page. 2. Amounts
requested may be up to $1000. Include a short justi-
cation for the use of the funds. Indicate any additional
matching funds and include letters of commitment from
collaborative partners. NOTE: Projects under $500 will
receive funds upon award. Projects from $500 - $1000
will receive funds upon completion of the project and
submission of receipts. 3. Send your request by email
attachment (subject heading 'SSE Outreach 2018') to
Robert Pennock [pennock5@msu.edu] no later than 25
January 2018.
Applications will be ranked by an SSE Education Com-
mittee working group according to the following criteria:

We are looking for voluntary eld research assistants to
get involved with our research on the completely subter-
ranean, highly social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys
damarensis) in the Kalahari (South Africa). We are
conducting a long-term capture-mark and recapture
study, based at the Kalahari Research Centre, to investi-
gate the life-history and social behaviour of Damaraland
mole-rats (http://kalahari-meerkats.com/kmp/research-February 1, 2018 EvolDir 109
publications/damaraland-mole rats-group/). Entire
groups of mole-rats will be captured and individually
marked. Morphological measurements and tissue sam-
ples will be obtained before the release of the animals.
The eld work is physically demanding and weather con-
ditions are challenging (heat during the day, cold during
the night). Field work may make trapping during the
night necessary. The assistants will mostly be working
in teams of two but will be embedded in a large research
community. This position requires working in a small
team in a remote location on free ranging animals. The
trapping season will start in Mid-March and last for 3
months. Research assistant will require a valid driving
license.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants are
paid a monthly allowance to cover their personal costs
and food.
We will review applications as they arrive. Please apply
at latest the 8th of February. Please apply by email

SouthAfrica Volunteers
RiverPipeshConservation
Volunteer position: river pipesh conservation
We are looking for volunteer research assistants/interns
to participate in a diving survey, genome screening
and/or establishment of a captive breeding population
of one of Africa's rarest coastal sh species, the critically
endangered river pipesh, *Syngnathus watermeyeri*.
This small pipesh was believed to have become extinct
at the end of the 20th century, but a small number
of survivors has subsequently been found in some of
the estuaries in its small range in the Eastern Cape
Province, South Africa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-
River pipesh). However, it is presently hanging on by
a thread, and the survivors are believed to be highly
inbred, and at great risk of imminent extinction.
This position is particularly suited for, but not limited
to, young researchers wishing to gain experience in a
wide variety of conservation-related elds. Successful
applicants can choose their level of involvement, which
may include participation in diving surveys (including
mark-and-recapture), DNA laboratory work and unix-
based data analyses (at the University of Johannesburg),and the establishment of a captive breeding population
(at uShaka Marine World in Durban).
The rst eld survey is expected to take place in late
March 2018. The costs for food, accommodation and
diving equipment during the eldwork will be covered.
Participants have to arrange travel to and from the study
site themselves. Subsequent surveys will take place ap-
proximately every 6 months for the next 3 years.
If you are interested in this position, please send a letter
of motivation and a short CV highlighting skills and
interests relevant to the project to Prof. Peter Teske,
University of Johannesburg (prteske@uj.ac.za). Please
also provide contact details of at least 3 referees.

(http://www.systass.org/) jointly administer the Sys-
tematics Research Fund (SRF) that provides grants
annually for small-scale research projects in the eld of
systematics.
Typical activities supported include contributions to
eldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientic equip-
ment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical equip-
ment), specimen preparation (including the cost of tem-
porary technical assistance), and contributions to publi-
cation costs. However, please note that it is unable to
fund the cost of article publication charges. Projects of

Evoldir folks,
Many thanks to those who responded to my question
regarding teaching material for blind students in Gen-
eral Biology. Below are ideas that we use/will try this
semester here at Wichita State, followed by links pro-
vided by the EvolDir community. A general trend seems
to be a lack of existing biology materials, even fewer
for university level, and fewer still for evolution/ecology
topics. There is an opportunity for someone with 3D
printing design experience to really be an angel here.
Not that I believe in angels.

EvolutionaryGenomics
Postdoctoral positions are available in Susanne Pfeifer's
group at Arizona State University, Tempe (US). Re-
search in the Pfeifer Lab is focused on analysing high-
throughput sequencing data to learn about genetic and
evolutionary|processes, with a particular interest in:
(i) Mutation rate variation in primates A better un-
derstanding of the basis of evolutionary variation as
generated by mutation will improve both insights into
the genetic basis of disease as well as our understanding
of the chronology of human evolution. Germ line mu-
tations depend on several biological processes that are
well known to vary between dierent primate species,
yet only a limited number of studies has focused on di-
rectly estimating mutation rates in non-human primates.
Projects will involve computational method development
as well as the analysis of large-scale genomic pedigree
data to characterize variation in mutation rates|across
the primate clade.
(ii) Genomic mechanisms underlying links between evolu-
tionary shifts In many species, coloration is an important
phenotypic trait, involved in a range of dierent biologi-
cal processes ranging from sexual signalling to crypsis to
mimicry to thermoregulation. Building upon our results
in recently evolved cryptically colored populations, we
are extending this work to consider the co-evolution of
coloration phenotypes with other evolutionary signals.
Successful candidates are expected to have a strong com-
putational and statistical background (programming
prociency in R, Perl, or Python, and shell scripting
is essential; experience with analysing high throughput
sequencing data is highly desired) along with a genuine
interest in genetics and evolution. Preference will be
given to candidates with a strong publication record,
evidence of research productivity, and an ability to suc-
cessfully communicate scientic information. Funding is
available for three years, contingent on annual renewal
based on progress. The start date is exible.
The Pfeifer Lab oers a vibrant work environment
with excellent opportunities for collaborative eorts
as well as independent accomplishments. The Lab is
integrated within a diverse bioinformatics, evolution,
and population genetics research community at ASUFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 117

terested applicants should send a short summary of
research interests, CV, and contact information for two
references to susanne.pfeifer@asu.edu. The evaluation
of applications will begin on January 15th, 2018, and

and importance in all elds of quantitative research.
Meta-analyses allow a formal assessment of the gener-
alizability of research ndings and an exploration of
context dependencies. This involves a thorough read-
ing of the published literature and will thus strengthen
both conceptual and quantitative thinking. Specically,
we will explore the extent to which factors like envi-
ronmental complexity, assortative mating, ecological
inheritance, temporal variation, niche inheritance, con-
dition dependence and others lead to between individual
variation concerning individualized niches. The projectwill collaborate intensely with various empirical projects
within the SFB. It promises strong training in statistical
analyses, deep conceptual understanding and advances
in several of subelds of ecology and evolution concerned
with individualization.
The collaborative research center: The position will be
embedded within a larger collaborative research center
(SFB) comprising 18 principle investigators, 8 postdocs
and 16 PhD students based at Bielefeld University, the
University of M unster and the University of Jena. The
aim of the SFB is to produce a conceptual and empirical
synthesis of individualization across behavior, ecology
and evolution. The SFB will provide exceptional op-
portunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and aca-
demic networking, together with structured training,
scientic exchange and early career support programs.

SpeciationGenomics
A postdoctoral position in Genomics of speciation at
Charles University in Prague
Position available: from June 2018 to December 2020
Application deadline: 18 ^th February 2018
We are looking for a motivated post-doc to join our
group working on genomics of speciation in two hy-
bridizing songbirds, the Common Nightingale and the
Thrush Nightingale. These species hybridize in a sec-
ondary contact zone and produce viable hybrid progeny.
In accordance with Haldane's Rule, hybrid females are
sterile, while hybrid males are fertile, allowing gene ow
to occur between the species. The two species also show
marked dierences in sperm morphology, which could
contribute to post-mating prezygotic isolation. The
main goal of the project aims at identifying genetic basis
and molecular mechanisms of both hybrid female steril-
ity and postmating prezygotic isolation. The project
will combine QTL mapping experiments and population
genomic analyses of transcriptomes and whole genome
sequences of both species. The successful applicant will
be mainly responsible for the bioinformatic part of the
project. The position requires experience in analysis of
large-scale next-generation sequence data and the ideal
candidate should have background in quantitative or
population genetics. Programming skills are desirable.
Salary:
The candidate's monthly income will be 1,500 EUR (ca
37,500 CZK) with the possibility of increase up to 2,000
EUR (ca 50,000 CZK). Note that living expenses in
the Czech Republic are generally lower than in Western
European countries.

eDNAanalysis
*Post doctoral position : Improving marine biodiversity
inventories through eDNA analysis*
*Context*
The knowledge and understanding of the ecology and
evolution of the marine realm requires an enhanced
appraisal of marine biodiversity and of the biotic and
abiotic drivers of its distribution and evolution. Yet
the very rst step, that of inventory, appears stumbled:
considering the pace of taxonomic description in 2015,
an estimated 10,000 years would be required to com-
plete the taxonomic descriptions and inventory of the
majority of the existing biodiversity, provided it would
be accessed and sampled. The recent improvement and
unprecedented acceleration of sequencing techniques
and the development of environmental genomics open
promising avenue for the development of methods allow-
ing the rapid and reliable characterization of biodiversity
and ecosystems status (Valentini et al. 2009, Creer et al.
2010, Hajibabaei et al. 2011), including in the deep sea
(Pawlowski et al. 2011, Sinniger et al. 2016) . Previous
studies have shown good evidences for the potential of
metagenomics in support of monitoring surveys(Ji et
al. 2013, Cowart et al. 2015, Pawlowski et al. 2015,
Aylagas et al. 2016, Cordier et al. 2017) and ultimately
leading to new tools and/or indicators to assess potential
impacts from industrial operations (Bista et al. 2015,
Lejzerowicz et al. 2015).During a previous collaboration, Total and Ifremer de-
veloped protocols of metabarcode and compared their
eciency with classical morphological inventories (Cow-
art et al. 2015). Their aim in the EU H2020 project
\Atlas: A Trans-AtLantic Assessment and deep-water
ecosystem-based Spatial management plan for Europe"
is to go one step beyond using constantly upgraded pro-
tocols (taking into account the evolution of molecular
and bioinformatics tools) in deep sea ecosystems includ-
ing Atlantic habitats among which potentially impacted
ones.
The post-doc is hired to contribute analyzing deep
sea sediment samples with the objective of compar-
ing and if necessary improving existing protocols based
on metabarcoding and capture methods. This will be
performed to fulll the needs of operational sites surveys
and feed comparative approach between eDNA based
and conventional taxonomic approaches. The objective
is to develop standardized molecular and bioinformatics
protocols and indicators for environmental impact as-
sessments, and consider the denition of new indicators.

*Good background in community ecology, genomics and

cation and warming) on coral reef shes, specically
the damselsh (*Acanthochromis polyacanthus*) and
the clownsh (*Amphiprion percula*). Our main goal
is to understand acclimation to climate change at thegenomic level by using a set of unique multi-generational
experiments. These studies combine Next-Generation
Sequencing approaches such as genome and transcrip-
tome sequencing to understand the molecular mecha-
nisms that underline sh responses to climate stressors.

MasseyU ComputationalGenomics
Postdoc in Computational Genomics Massey University,
New Zealand
I am looking for a motivated postdoctoral fellow to ex-
plore the evolution of genome structure in lamentous
fungi. My group is interested in interactions between
genome structure and gene expression, epigenetic modi-
cation and 3D conformation. A key focus of this postdoc
will be on how interactions like these change over evo-
lutionary time. This research program will build on a
growing set of genomic data for the genus Epichloe, an
increasingly important model system for studying the
genome evolution of haploid and polyploid fungi.
The postdoc will be expected to help develop her/his
own research program, with an emphasis on addressing
novel hypotheses rather than data description. This
analytical position requires solid quantitative and com-
putational skills, with the ability to develop and apply
new bioinformatic applications to genome analysis. At
a minimum, some condence in bioinformatics and a
programming language is required. Training in fungal
biology or genomics can be provided as needed, and can-
didates from non-standard research backgrounds with a
clear t to the position are encouraged to apply.February 1, 2018 EvolDir 125
Funding is guaranteed for two years and three months,
but may be extendable. Salaries are extremely compet-
itive, starting at NZ $69,000, considerably higher than
comparable salaries in the US and Europe. Items consid-
ered benets in some other countries, such as healthcare
coverage, are a standard right in New Zealand.
My research group aims to achieve work-life balance
within a productive scientic environment. The team is
rmly embedded in the international scientic commu-
nity, with extensive collaborative links to Australia, Asia,
Europe and the United States. Ongoing training is a key
focus for postdocs. As a computational biology group,
I oer a supportive environment for computationally-
inclined postdocs to work towards independence. The
successful candidate will not be a lone bioinformaticist
isolated in a bench biology group.
My group is highly international, and applicants from
all countries and backgrounds are actively encouraged
to apply. Members of underrepresented groups are wel-
come, as are postdocs with families.
The position will be based in my computational biol-
ogy research group at Massey University in the city of
Palmerston North, New Zealand. This oers a rare op-
portunity to experience New Zealand's unique natural
and cultural environment, while still undertaking world
leading research. Palmerston North, a university town
with a large international community, oers a full range
of social and cultural amenities. The city is located
between mountains and the sea, and presents regular
opportunities for hiking, skiing, surng and adventure
sports. It also has a good caf e scene for those of a more
cosmopolitan bent.

A postdoctoral training position is currently available
in the Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch
(CSGB) of the National Human Genome Research Insti-
tute (NHGRI). The position is located in the laboratory
of Andy Baxevanis, Ph.D., whose research group uses
comparative genomics approaches to better-understand
the molecular innovations that drove the surge of diver-
sity in early animal evolution. The overarching theme of
Dr. Baxevanis' research program is focused on how non-
traditional animal models can be used to convey critical
insights into human disease research, in line with the
NIH Intramural Research Program's renewed emphasis

biology.
With this translational context in mind, Dr. Baxeva-
nis' group is currently leading an international eort to
sequence two cnidarian species: Hydractinia echinata
and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. The regenerative
abilities of these colonial hydrozoans make them ex-
cellent models for the study of key questions related
to pluripotency, allorecognition, and stem cell biology,
work that will be signicantly advanced by the avail-
ability of high-quality whole-genome sequencing data
from these organisms. In addition, and in collaboration
with colleagues at the Whitney Marine Laboratory of
the University of Florida, the group is also now focusing
on polychaete species that show particular promise for
advancing our understanding of regeneration and early
developmental processes. The successful applicant will
have the opportunity to develop and apply bioinformatic
approaches to these and other large-scale genomic data
sets, focusing on the evolution of specic protein fami-
lies and biological pathways that have putative roles in
disease causation.
Candidates should have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D.
or equivalent degree in bioinformatics, computational
biology, computer science, molecular biology, or a closely
related eld. Candidates with a background in evolu-128 EvolDir February 1, 2018
tionary biology are particularly encouraged to apply.
Programming skills and experience in the application
of computational methods to genomic data are highly
desirable. Applicants must possess good communica-
tion skills and be uent in both spoken and written
English. The ability to learn how to use new software
and quickly become expert in its use, critical think-
ing, problem-solving abilities, and the ability to work
semi-independently are required.
The NIH Intramural Research Program is on the
Bethesda, Maryland campus and oers a wide array of
training opportunities for scientists early in their careers.
The funding for this position is stable and oers the
trainee wide latitude in the design and pursuit of their

in frogs. The project integrates morphological, molecu-
lar, and physiological data to investigate the evolution
of vision systems in frogs at both broad and recent
timescales - from across the frog tree of life to recently-
diverged lineages. Molecular evolutionary studies will
provide a genomic perspective on vision evolution to test
hypotheses about natural selection, gene duplication,
and retention of vision genes. The overall project runs
for four years and tackles several sub-projects, includ-
ing: (1) characterizing the physiology and molecular
underpinnings of vision in species with varying early
life-history modes, (2) testing whether the evolution of

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION ON INSECT VEC-
TORS OF PLANT VIRUSES
In support of a large multi-investigator initiative to
develop vectored plant viruses that could edit plant
genomes, a postdoctoral position is available in the
Scott lab at North Carolina State University. The main
aim is to develop transgenic strains of plant vectors
carrying conditional lethal genes.
The vectors are aphid and leafhopper species that trans-
mit viruses that impact corn. The engineered strains
would not survive in the absence of a small chemical
regulator such as an antibiotic. The modied insects
would thus have a limited lifespan in proposed green-
house trials but in the future could also potentially be
used for genetic control programs.
The position is suitable for recent PhD graduates in
entomology or genetics. Experience in molecular genet-
ics and knowledge of insect vectors of plant viruses is
desirable.

SLU Sweden EvolutionaryEcology
A POSTDOC POSITION in Evolutionary Ecology is
available in The Strawberry Lab at SLU, SWEDEN.
Plant resistance and tolerance to herbivores often show
high complexity that results from interactions with mul-
tiple selective agents. Understanding the complex na-
ture of plant defences against multiple herbivores, as
well as the evolutionary and ecological consequences
of attack by multiple herbivores, adds not only to our
knowledge of the evolutionary ecology of plant-herbivoreinteractions, but is also likely to benet attempts to
nd sustainable plant protection strategies.
THE AIM of this postdoc project is to gain knowledge
about the evolutionary and ecological consequences of
attack by multiple herbivores. Woodland strawberry,
Fragaria vesca L., will be used as a model plant. Since
non-domesticated plant species in general are more re-
sistant and tolerant to herbivores, and show higher
variation in their traits, studying woodland strawberry
provides useful information about traits that contribute
to improved resistance and tolerance. The postdoc will
have access to a large number of strawberry genotypes
that show high genetic variation in several traits. For
example, we already have some knowledge on genetic
variation in plant resistance against the strawberry leaf
beetle (Muola et al. 2017) as well as some preliminary
data on plant resistance and tolerance against several
other herbivores. The postdoc is expected to expand
this knowledge through experimental work. Woodland
strawberry shares substantial sequence identity with gar-
den strawberry (Fragaria ~A ananassa). The genome of
woodland strawberry has been sequenced and it serves
as model plant for cultivated strawberries. Thus, un-
derstanding the dierent defence strategies of woodland
strawberry provides useful information for plant breed-
ers.
QUALIFICATIONS: We are looking for a highly moti-
vated candidate with a PhD degree in Evolutionary Ecol-
ogy or similar subject. Scientic qualications within
the area are necessary. Good collaborative ability is
also necessary. The ranking of candidates will be made
based on proven scientic competence within the sub-
ject of the position. Priority will be given to applicants
who have been awarded their PhD degree at most three
years before the application deadline. The candidate
should have the ability to work independently, take
own initiatives, and have an interest in Integrated Pest
Management.
SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS to attach: CV including a
list of publications, max. ve publications, description
of previous research and current research interest (max.
two pages), contact details to at least two reference
persons.

Postdoc position: long-term trends in protein evolution
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna Masel

versity of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist des-
tination surrounded on all four sides by mountainous
national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city of
nearly a million people with an attractive climate. The
EEB department was ranked in the top 10 by US News
& World Report.
We recently found that genes of dierent ages en-
code proteins with dierent computationally predictable
structural properties, forming an extraordinarily long-
term trend (see https://doi.org/10.1101/176867). This
project will use bioinformatics techniques to discover
whether these long-term trends are really a consequence
of evolution by descent with modication that continues
for long periods of time in a consistent direction. It
will also provide a major new annotation of genes based
on homology, in order to begin removing the problem
of phylogenetic confounding within gene families from
\correlomics".
Techniques used may include phylostratigraphy (assign-
ing ages to gene families), ancestral sequence recon-
struction, and porting macroevolutionary techniques
for studying speciation and extinction to the study of
gene duplication and loss. A high level of statistical
sophistication is required throughout.
Excellent computer programming skills are strongly pre-
ferred, ideally with bioinformatics / genomics and statis-
tics experience. Exceptionally strong candidates who
come from a more experimental background within evo-
lutionary biology, and who now wish to retrain as bioin-
formaticians, will also be considered. A background
in evolutionary biology is also strongly preferred, al-

knowledge, and knowledge about protein structure and
folding, are advantages. Start date is negotiable, and

to develop and test methods to measure the repeatability
and constraints on the genetic basis of local adaptation.
We seek to develop genomic methods that will quantify
the extent to which the genetic basis of local adaptation
is shared among evolutionarily distinct lineages, based
on inference from gene-environment correlations and
genome-wide association studies.
This project is part of a larger initiative called CoAd-
apTree ( http://coadaptree.forestry.ubc.ca), funded by
Genome Canada. CoAdapTree aims to uncover the ge-
netic basis of adaptation to climate and fungal pathogens
for several economically-important conifer species. This
will include large population-scale sequencing eorts in
four species (lodgepole pine, Douglas r, western larch,
and jack pine).
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in
both evolutionary biology and statistics. Experience
with bioinformatics, phylogenetics, or evolutionary ge-
nomics would be desirable but not required.138 EvolDir February 1, 2018
In addition to the core project of methods development,
this post-doc has the possibility of collaborating on
further projects, including other analyses of the larger
CoAdapTree project or the development of theory on
mechanisms of convergent evolution.
Funding is available for two years with salary of 0,000
Canadian per year plus benets.

PlantBacterialSymbiosis
The Sachs Lab at UC Riverside is recruiting a postdoc-
toral scholar to join our team. We are looking for aFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 139
highly motivated, independent, postdoctoral scholar to
study the evolution and population genomics of plant-
bacterial symbioses.
We use eld studies, greenhouse experiments, in vitro
evolution, and next-generation sequencing to investi-
gate nitrogen-xing symbioses between rhizobia and
legumes. In the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, soil bacteria
trigger the formation of nodules on legume roots and
x nitrogen for their host in exchange for carbon. This
mutualism generates much of the xed nitrogen for our
biosphere, promotes plant growth and carbon seques-
tration, and accelerates ecosystem development. But
among rhizobial genotypes there is signicant variation
in nitrogen xation, including ineective strains (non-
nitrogen xing) that can be common in some habitats.
Ineective rhizobia persist in natural and agricultural
soils, but scant is known about the forces that drive
variation in the key mutualist service of nitrogen xa-
tion.
We work on wild, model, and crop legume species that
interact with multiple bacterial symbiont lineages. The
postdoc can propose research or can choose their pri-
mary research foci once they join the lab. Major projects
in our lab include i) investigating the evolution and
mechanisms of 'host control' traits in legumes that con-
strain exploitation in rhizobial symbiont populations,
ii) uncovering competitive interactions among rhizobia
in soil communities to explain the genomic and phe-
notypic drivers of rhizobial strain dominance, and iii)
using greenhouse and in vitro experiments to gener-
ate novel applications to improve crop growth. Our
group is broad and has included students focusing on
plant biology, microbiology, genetics and genomics, and
evolutionary ecology.
Candidates should have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biol-
ogy, genetics, genomics, population biology, or related
disciplines. Solid bacteriology skills and some computa-
tional competence are both a plus for this position. A
strong background in evolutionary and or molecular ge-
netics would also be useful. Finally, the ideal candidate
would have experience with next-generation sequencing
techniques, which might include RADseq and highly-
multiplexed-whole genome sequencing. Irrespective of
experience, the postdoc must be able to learn new tech-
niques and quickly and easily troubleshoot protocols.
She or he will likely work closely with graduate students
and the PI to manage multiple research projects and
thus we seek a team player with excellent leadership
skills.
The start date is exible. The position will be available
as early as March 2018, but can begin later if necessary.
The position is initially for a one-year period, with pos-sible extension of another two years, dependent upon
satisfactory performance. Salary is commensurate with
experience and qualications.
Application for the position requires three documents:
1. A cover letter describing your interest in the position
and that details 2 projects that you would like to do in
our lab.
2. Contact details of three referees
3. A CV
Interested individuals should send these materials to
joel.sachs@ucr.edu by February 15, 2018. Also, feel free
to e-mail me to ask any questions about the position or
our lab.

Topic: Parasite oence or host defence? The ecology
and evolution of biological rhythms in malaria infection
Details and application info at: https:/-

rhythms allow activities to be coordinated with the
consequences of the Earth's daily and seasonal rotation.
The mechanisms underpinning the clocks that drive
daily rhythms are well understood. In contrast, the
costs and benets provided by daily rhythms - including
how rhythms shape interactions between organisms -
are poorly understood. One of the most fundamental
interactions between organisms is that between hosts
and parasites. Why parasites - that exclusively live
within the bodies of other organisms - exhibit biological
rhythms and how they are regulated are longstanding
questions. Examining the roles of rhythms in disease is a
new arena for studying host-parasite-vector coevolution.
Also, integrating disease control interventions into an
evolutionary chronobiology framework oers innovative
approaches to improving health. This includes the
development of drugs to disrupt parasite rhythms,142 EvolDir February 1, 2018
harnessing circadian systems to enhance immune
responses, or precisely timing drug administration to
make treatment more eective.
We are oering a postdoctoral position as part of a
Wellcome Trust funded project to investigate the role
of circadian rhythms in malaria infection. The project
will integrate a novel mix of disciplines (evolutionary
ecology, chronobiology, and parasitology) to determine
why and how timing matters for interactions between
parasites, hosts and vectors, the severity and transmis-
sion of disease, and tness of all parties. This is a very
broad topic and so the successful candidate will be en-
couraged to develop their own niche. Growing evidence
that the daily rhythms of malaria parasites can confer
tolerance to antimalarial drugs, and that the use of bed
nets is changing the biting time of the mosquitoes that
transmit malaria makes understanding how and why
parasites exhibit daily rhythms increasingly urgent.
This interdisciplinary Wellcome Trust funded project
will break new ground by elucidating the evolutionary
ecology of biological rhythms for parasites. It will inte-
grate a novel mix of disciplines (evolutionary ecology,
chronobiology, and parasitology) and open up novel av-
enues for disease control. The post holder will plan, con-
duct and write up research that they have led and sup-
port the research of others in the lab. The project will
focus on a rodent malaria, murine host, and mosquito
vector model system.
This post is full time and xed term for 3 years.

PlantSpeciationGeonomics
*Project description*
Although parallel speciation is a well-recognized phe-
nomenon in animals, it is poorly evidenced in plants.
This project aims to address the following general ques-
tions: Does ecology aect population structure in plants
to the degree that it can cause ecological speciation?
Does ecological speciation occur parallel in continental
systems? Can evidence of ecological speciation support
a model of sympatric speciation, where new species
arise in overlapping geographic distributions? These
questions will be applied to a model system that has
been developed in an Amazonian palm (Listabarth 1993;
Roncal et al. 2006, 2007; Borchsenius et al. 2016; Bacon
et al. in preparation).
We are looking for a highly motivated and skilled person
to work with statistical approaches, phylogeonomics and
phylogeography, and species occurrence data to develop
a framework to test for parallel ecological speciation.
The work is focused on palms, specically on *Geonoma
macrostachys,* but data is also available for compara-
tive phylogeographical work with the palm, *Mauritia
exuosa*, and other Amazonian taxa across the tree of
Life. This four-year project is funded by the Swedish
Research Council.
*Job assignments *The tasks envisioned will include
some or all of the following:
-
Field work in the western Amazon (e.g. Colombia,
Ecuador) -
DNA extraction -
Bioinformatics and phylogeographical analyses -

through time
- Quantify adaptability to climate using outlier SNP loci
*Eligibility *The applicant must hold a PhD in an area
relevant for the tasks at hand (molecular phylogenetics,
molecular ecology, phylogeography, biostatistics, bioin-
formatics, or related elds). The PhD exam must be
nished prior to the closing date of this announcement.

Grand Challenges in Biology Postdoctoral Program
College of Biological Sciences
University of Minnesota
Application deadline: February 1, 2018
Position start date: May-August 2018 (specic date
negotiable)
Rationale
Understanding and predicting the behavior of complex
biological systems requires a framework that can inte-
grate across levels of biological organization, can capture
nonlinear feedbacks in dynamical systems, and can incor-
porate and facilitate mechanistic understanding. This
is the challenge of the future of biology. Meeting this
challenge requires a multidisciplinary approach that re-
lies heavily on innovations in quantitative elds such as
mathematics, computer science, statistics, and engineer-
ing. It also requires strong integration (or re-integration)
of molecular biology with organismal biology. Meeting
the food, water, and energy needs of a growing human
population, while minimizing adverse impacts of habitat
alteration, climate change, invasive species, overexploita-
tion, and pollution on human health and ecological sys-
tems - operate at scales from molecules to ecosystems,
and there is a pressing need to develop the science that
can cross these scales. The University of Minnesota is
developing research and curricular initiatives focused on
addressing grand challenges, and this program is part
of CBS' contribution to the university-wide programs.
Program Aims
The overall aim of the Grand Challenges in Biology
(GCB) Postdoctoral Program is to stimulate synergisticFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 145
interactions between faculty and postdoctoral associates
interested in collaborating on multidisciplinary research
that addresses societally relevant problems. Postdoc-
toral projects are for two years (assuming satisfactory
progress toward research goals in year one). Postdoc-
toral associates will be encouraged to participate in
grant proposal development workshops and other profes-
sional development activities oered at UMN and CBS
and are permitted to serve as Principal Investigators
on grant proposals. While in residence, the postdoc-
toral associates will be expected to be visible members
of CBS, actively engaging with faculty, undergraduate-
and graduate students and contributing to furthering
the collaborative culture of CBS.

Uppsala PopulationGenomics
Researcher in population genomics at Uppsala Univer-

We have an opening for a researcher in a project inves-
tigating local adaptation in dogs. The position is for
one year, with possibility for extension, in the group of
Dr. Erik Axelsson at Uppsala University. Deadline for
application is February 15, 2018.February 1, 2018 EvolDir 149
Project description: Thanks to the rapid and recent
changes accompanying domestication, comparisons of
wild and domestic life forms represent an ideal system
for characterizing the genetic basis of phenotypic diver-
sity. Based on whole genome sequencing we recently
compared patterns of genetic variation in dog and wolf
to provide an initial understanding of the genetic basis
of adaptations during dog domestication. We found that
selection had targeted the entire pathway responsible
for starch digestion and glucose absorption in the small
intestine of dogs, indicating that a shift from a meat
based to a starch rich diet constituted a crucial step
during the domestication process. Combined with ev-
idence that this change was accompanied by selection
for mutations that also aected the ability to store glu-
cose as fat, these ndings argue that dogs underwent
a general shift from a protein to a more carbohydrate
based energy metabolism. Dog domestication may thus
represent a unique and unexplored natural model for
studying metabolism arguing that a detailed charac-
terization of the genetic basis of adaptations during
dog domestication represents a novel perspective on the
molecular components of nutrient absorption and carbo-
hydrate and lipid metabolism. To benet from this new
perspective and to understand how dogs coped with the
fundamental changes associated with the agricultural
revolution this project combines large scale population
genomic analyses, transcriptomics and analyses of exist-
ing comparative genetics resources to localize mutations
that are likely to underlie metabolic adaptations in dog,
followed by physiological experiments in genetically mod-
ied cell lines to test the eect of the indicated genes
on metabolic processes.
Job description: Research in the project described above.
The successful applicant will mainly analyse population
scale whole genome resequencing data and transcrip-
tome data.
Qualications: To be eligible to apply you must have
a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, population genetics,
genomics, bioinformatics or another relevant eld. The
position requires documented experience in large-scale
next- generation DNA sequencing analysis and the ideal
candidate is highly motivated with a strong background
in statistical, quantitative or population genetics. Can-
didates must have good communication skills, both in
written and spoken English. Programming skills are
desirable. We will put great emphasis on your per-
sonal qualities and interpersonal skills such as ability
for collaborative work and exibility.

EVOLVABILITY OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
GENES, POST-DOC Lionel Guy and Diarmaid Hughes
are looking for a post-doctoral fellow with, ideally, expe-
rience of both bacterial genetics and molecular evolution
to tackle a collaborative project on the evolvability of
ancestral antibiotics resistance genes.
PROJECT The mains goals are (i) to better under-
stand how dierent antibiotic resistance genes evolved
before the clinical use of antibiotics, and to assess (ii)
their evolutionary potential and (iii) the predictability
of the mutations providing antibiotic resistance. We
will focus on four classes of genes providing resistance
to four classes of antibiotics: beta-lactams, aminoglyco-
sides, tetracycline and the last-resort antibiotic colistin.
First, the successful candidate will reconstruct the evo-
lutionary history of each class of genes, trying to infer
what they are derived from. Second, they will evaluate
the resistance potential of ancestors, by reconstructing
them, cloning them into E. coli MG1655 and assessing
their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Third,
the reconstructed ancestors will be evolved in sub-MIC
conditions, to examine evolutionary paths and time nec-
essary to reach present-day MICs. By comparing the
mutations obtained in experimental evolution to the
ones found in actual modern sequences we'll be watch-
ing how \replaying the tape of life" mimics the actual
evolutionary pressures experienced by sequences in vivo,
and may predict the potential emergence of antibiotics
resistance in clinical settings.

Postdoctoral fellow in evolutionary genetics/genomics
Department of Biology, University of Rochester
The Fay lab in the Biology Department at the University
of Rochester is seeking candidates for a postdoctoral fel-
low position. The lab works broadly on the genetic basis
of evolutionary change, utilizing both high-throughput
experimental approaches combined with statistical and
computational models. Our main experimental system
is yeast, focusing on the Saccharomyces species with
occasional forays into Candida and other species that
commonly show up in our eld collections. However, we
also have active collaborations working on domestication
in barley, preterm birth in humans, and testing theo-
ries of diversity using experimental evolution. These
interactions both stimulate project cross-fertilization
and create opportunities to develop novel approaches to
long-standing problems of interest to the lab.
Candidates will have the opportunity to expand on cur-
rent projects or explore new areas through the develop-
ment of a creative and independent project. Our currentFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 151
projects focus on the evolution of gene expression dy-
namics and when changes in gene expression matter,
the genetic basis of interspecic dierences in thermotol-
erance, and domestication and diversication of S. cere-
visiae, including wine, beer and other industrial strains.
We have extensive resources in population genomics
through our collection of over 4,000 wild yeast strains,
probabilistic models of cis-regulatory sequences, as well
as our recent acquisition of high-throughput robotics
paired with both natural and constructed collections of
strain, plasmid and synthetic reporter libraries.
Candidates should have a clear vision of their research
interests along with expectations for training and men-
torship. While there are no strict requirements for
the position, strong quantitative skills, programming
experience, and a population or evolutionary genetics
background are desirable.
The Fay lab is located in the Biology Department, which
has a strong research group in evolutionary genetics and
genomics that has recently grown, providing a stimu-
lating and interactive environment. The Department is
located on the top oors of Hutchinson Hall, adjacent to
the Goergen Institute for Data Science, Computer Sci-
ence and Biomedical Engineering Departments. We also
benet from an excellent group of yeast labs originally
built up through the vision of Fred Sherman. Genomics
and proteomics cores are available across the street at
the Medical center. Finally, the Center for Integrated
Research and Computing provide state of the art fa-
cilities for both parallel and large memory computing
jobs.
Applicants for the position should send a curriculum vi-

EvolutionSexualDimorphism
Title of project: Evolution of sex dierences in life his-
tories despite a shared genome
I am seeking a highly motivated postdoc to join the
Bolund lab at the Dept. of Ecology and Genetics, Evo-152 EvolDir February 1, 2018
lutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden.
The project is funded by the Carl Tryggers Foundation
and the Swedish Research Council, VR.
Project: Females and males often have dierent pheno-
typic optima for important life history traits, but their
shared genome causes conict. Such sexual conict is
a dominating theme in evolutionary studies. Dierent
selection pressures in the two sexes can decouple the
genetic basis of the trait, allowing the resolution of con-
ict through sexual dimorphism. However, traits are
seldom independent and covariances between traits can
strongly inuence evolutionary trajectories.
This project aims to understand how the strength of
intra-locus sexual conict over multiple life history traits
constrains or facilitates the evolution of sexual dimor-
phism. You will use the nematode Caenorhabditis re-
manei, a powerful model system, and study lines that
have been subjected to experimental evolution under
increased/decreased sexual conict. Within this frame-
work, there are several possible lines of enquiry to pursue
depending on the interests and background of the suc-
cessful candidate. These include the study of:
-The evolution of genetic variances and covariances (rep-
resented statistically by the G matrix) within males
(GM), within females (GF) and between traits between
the sexes (B and its transpose BT). The stability of G
and B over evolutionary time remains an open question.
Estimations of GF, GM and B and their stability over
time is essential to our understanding of both long-term
constraints on the independent evolution of the sexes
and of how dierent populations are expected to evolve
under sex-specic selection.
-The relative importance of pre- and post-copulatory
sexual selection on the evolutionary dynamics of sexual
conict.
You will join the lab of Dr. Elisabeth Bolund, and be
part of the well-equipped nematode lab, led by two PI-s
(Dr. Bolund and Dr. Lind). In the Bolund lab, we are
interested in the evolutionary dynamics of life histories,
sexual dimorphism and sexual conict, using nematodes
and humans as model organisms. Within the lab, we
encourage a dynamic collaborative atmosphere.
Qualications: The successful candidate will have a
Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics, or a
related eld. A background in or experience of some
of the following areas is desirable: evolutionary biology,
life history evolution, sexual conict/sexual selection,
quantitative genetics, statistics (experience in Bayesian
analyses is a plus), basic R programming, and the run-
ning of large-scale lab experiments (with nematodes or
other species). Further, good team work and communi-cation skills are valued.
The environment:
EBC hosts one of the largest aggregations of evolution-
ary biologists in the world and Uppsala University was
recently ranked 7th in the world in evolutionary biology
(CWUR 2017). The Department of Ecology and Genet-
ics is a highly international working environment and

ExpEvolutionInheritanceSystems
Title of project: Experimental evolution of inheritance
systems
I am seeking a highly motivated postdoc to join the Lind
lab at Dept. of Animal Ecology, Evolutionary Biology
Centre (EBC), Uppsala University in a project funded
by Carl Tryggers Foundation and the Swedish Research
Council VR.
Project: The belief that the genetic code is the sole basis
for biological inheritance has been challenged by pheno-
typic plasticity and more recently by the discovery of
trans-generational epigenetic inheritance, where environ-
mentally induced phenotypes are inherited for several
generations by factors that determine how DNA is read.
However, the adaptive signicance of complementary
inheritance systems that is induced by the environment
is enigmatic.
The project aim is to investigate the evolution of adap-
tive plastic, epigenetic, trans-generational and genetic
inheritance during adaptation to new environments that
dier in heterogeneity, using the powerful laboratory
model system of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei.
We will use a combination of experimental evolution
and trans-generational phenotypic assays of life history
traits, including analyses of already existing lines. For
the experimental evolution part, the postdoc will work
in close collaboration with an already recruited PhD
student. Within this overall framework, there are sev-
eral possibilities to explore related areas in life history
evolution and environmental inuences on phenotypes,
depending upon the interests and background of the
candidate.
You will join the lab of Dr. Martin Lind, and be part
of the well-equipped nematode lab, led by two PIs (Dr.
Lind and Dr. Bolund). In the Lind lab, we are inter-
ested in life history evolution in its broad sense, with
special emphasis on local adaptation, the evolution of
inheritance systems, life-history trade-os and the evolu-
tion of lifespan and ageing. We encourage an open and
collaborative atmosphere in the lab, and many projects
are collaborative by design.
Qualications: We are seeking a highly motivated and
collaborative candidate with and with a background in
evolutionary biology, especially life-history evolution. Itis desirable if you have basic R programming knowledge
and experience of large-scale laboratory experiments of
nematodes or other organisms. The candidate will have
a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, genetics, ecology or a
related eld.
Working place: EBC hosts one of the world's largest
aggregations of evolutionary biologists and Uppsala Uni-
versity was recently ranked 7th in the world in evo-
lutionary biology (CWUR 2017). The Department of
Ecology and Genetics is an international environment

UUppsala Speciation
UUppsala.Speciation
Postcoctoral fellow in Evolutionary Biology
A 2-year postdoc position is available in the Karrenberg
group at the Dept. of Ecology and Genetics, Evolution-
ary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden. The
project is funded by the Carl Tryggers Foundation and
SciLifelab Sweden.
Title of project: How genomic divergence during specia-
tion arises: experimental assessment of allele transmis-
sion distortion
Processes that govern speciation and divergence are of
vital importance for most other areas of biology, yet
our understanding of organismal and genomic processes
generating divergence is still limited. While many ex-
trinsic reproductive barriers and the evolutionary forces
generating them have been identied, the evolution of
intrinsic barriers is not well-understood.
This project aims at experimentally assessing allele
transmission between two hybridizing sister species of
the non-model plant genus Silene, S. latifolia and S.
dioica using ddRADseq data. The two species exhibit a
complex array of reproductive barriers, including asym-
metric conspecic pollen precedence. We also know
that massive transmission distortion occurs in second-
generation hybrids between these species. Candidate
processes generating such transmission distortion in-
clude pollen competition, segregation distortion during
female meiosis (meiotic drive) and hybrid breakdown.
The project will disentangle these processes by com-
paring transmission ratio distortion between reciprocal
backcrosses of rst-generation hybrids. We have already
produced crosses and ddRADseq genotyped ospring
such that the postdoc can directly start with data anal-
ysis. This project can easily be extended to investigate
the evolutionary history of loci the lead to high seg-
regation distortion (ddRAD seq data from range-wide
sampling of each species is available) and/or a coinci-
dence of these loci with chromosomal re-arrangements
between the two species. Other extensions, for example
regarding phenotypic eects of distorter loci, can be
developed depending on the interest of the postdoc.
You will join the group of Sophie Karrenberg at Plant
ecology and Evolution, Institute of Ecology and Ge-netics, Uppsala University. In this research group, we
mainly study reproductive isolation and speciation in
Silene, including QTL mapping of traits related repro-
ductive isolation, and genome-wide divergence patterns.
We currently also focus on the role of the sex chromo-
somes for divergence and on the evolution of sexually
dimorphic traits within S. latifolia.
Qualications:
The successful candidate will have a Ph.D. in evolu-
tionary biology, ecology, genetics, or a related eld. A
background in or experience of some of the following
areas is desirable: speciation and reproductive isolation,
QTL analysis, construction of linkage maps, ideally also
analysis of transmission ratio distortion, population ge-
nomics, general statistics with R and R programming,
basic bioinformatics skills. Further, teamwork and com-
munication skills are highly valued.

recently ranked 7 ^th in the world in evolutionary biol-
ogy (CWUR 2017). The Department of Ecology and

UWisconsinMadison
ReproductiveIsolationGenomics
The research group of John Pool at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison invites applications for a postdoc-
toral research position. This scientist will lead our eorts
to establish a premier system for uncovering the genetic
basis of early-stage reproductive isolation.
Drosophila melanogaster originated in tropical Africa
before expanding worldwide as a human commensal
within the past ~10,000 years. From past work, we
know that partial prezygotic and postzygotic isolation
exists between African and European populations, and
that crosses between them result in frequent F2 lethality
and sterility. We also know that American populations
result from admixture between these same gene pools.
Recently, I used the 205 genomes of the Drosophila
Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to show that natural
selection has powerfully inuenced this admixture pro-
cess, and specically that many unlinked pairs of genes
show \ancestry disequilibrium", suggesting that many
pairs of African and European alleles are unfavorable
when combined (Pool 2015 MBE). Based on these recent
and prior results, we expect that a signicant number of
incompatibilities exist between these recently isolated
but adaptively dierentiated populations.
We consider this a uniquely appealing study system
for understanding the genetic and evolutionary deter-
minants of the earliest stages of reproductive isolation.
First, the relevant interactors are demonstrably con-
tributing to reduced genetic exchange in nature, and
have clear relevance to the evolutionary trajectoriesof these adaptively distinct populations. Second, the
study of populations that remain partially compatible
opens the door to large-scale QTL mapping of lethality
and sterility. Third, the recent time-scale of divergence
means that population genetics can still help us nd
causative loci (and even interacting pairs of loci, as
hinted above). And fourth, the unparalleled functional
tool kit of D. melanogaster presents an ideal opportunity
to conrm and characterize incompatibilities. There are
still very few clear examples of Bateson-Dobzhansky-
Muller incompatibilities, and this system could lengthen
the list signicantly.
The successful applicant will deploy a novel QTL map-
ping framework to identify pairs of loci that result in
lethality and sterility. They will also leverage existing
population genomic data from our Drosophila Genome
Nexus to detect specic candidate genes within these
QTL pairs. Depending on individual interests, they may
also estimate quantitative evolutionary models compati-
ble with our genomic data. I also encourage lab members
to develop their own project ideas, and I am open to
letting postdocs take important portions of our lab's
research program with them when they found new re-
search groups.
Our research group was founded 6+ years ago and
currently consists of the PI, one postdoc, four PhD
students, and six undergraduate researchers. I have
also advised four former postdocs, and the pub-
lication records of Amir Yassin and Justin Lack
show what a productive environment our lab can
be for postdocs. For more details on our lab's re-
search, its current membership, and its published track

Advanced R Programming ( https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course26/ )
WHEN
25-29 June 2018
WHERE Botanisches Museum, K onigin-Luise-Strae
6-8, Berlin (Germany)
Instructors:
VP Nagraj (University of Virginia (USA)).
Overview R is a popular open-source statistical com-
puting language. This course will introduce techniques
for programming in R, including how to work with a
variety of data structures, write functions and package
code for distribution. Each lesson will be interactive
with hands-on activities to solidify concepts covered in
lectures. The week will conclude with a package devel-
opment practicum, during which attendees will have the
opportunity to implement methods covered in class for
a project of their own design.
Target Audience The goal of this course is to provide
training on how to start using R as a programming
language: to write new functions, develop new tools or,
at the very least, interact with data programmatically.
While some examples may be drawn from bioinformat-
ics, statistics and / or epidemiology, the material will
not focus on data analysis techniques. As such, the
course will generally be domain-agnostic. Researchers
from a variety of disciplines are welcome. Those inter-
ested should have basic familiarity with R or another
programming language.
STRUCTURE The course material will be delivered
over 5 days, in 10 half-day sessions. These lessons will
build o of one another, and feature a mix of lecture
and in-class exercises.
Session content
Monday 25th. 09:30-17:30
Session 1: Data Structures
In the rst session we will survey data structures in
R. We'll cover assignment, indexing and programmatic
interaction with a number of types of objects, including
vectors, matrices, lists and data frames.February 1, 2018 EvolDir 161
Session 2: Conditionals and Iteration
Building on the data structures overview, we'll explore
approaches for implementing logic, testing conditions
and iterating over R objects. The material will include
comparisons via operators, looping, vectorization, \ap-
ply" functions and control ow.
Tuesday 26th. 09:30-17:30
Session 3: Functions
This session will introduce essentials of writing functions
in R. We will discuss methods for passing arguments,
establishing return values and handling errors. We'll
also spend time covering R environments, as well as the
system of searching for objects from within a function
and beyond.
Session 4: Debugging, Performance and Optimization
Writing a function is one thing ... xing semantic and
syntactic errors is another altogether. We'll dive into
this topic by way of looking at tools that are built into
R and RStudio for debugging code. This lesson will also
cover methods for diagnosing performance roadblocks
and proling code.
Wednesday 27th. 09:30-17:30
Session 5: Object Oriented Approaches
In the context of data analysis, R is most commonly used
as a functional programming language. This session will
introduce methodology for object oriented programming
(OOP) in R. The material will include how to dene S3
and S4 classes, as well as how to establish methods for
generic functions.
Session 6: Version Control with Git and Github
Git is a powerful program for version control and collab-
oration. This session will introduce workows for using
Git and Github, which is a popular platform for manag-
ing projects and distributing code. We'll pay particular
attention to how these tools are implemented in the
context of R programming and package development.
Thursday 28th. 09:30-17:30
Session 7: Package Development Tools (Part 1)
In this session, we'll survey tools, techniques and use-
cases for R package development. In addition to version
control tools (i.e. Git), there are a quite a few packages,
frameworks and convenient integrations with the RStu-
dio IDE that can facilitate the package development
workow. We will focus on package structure, documen-
tation, building and checking, handling dependencies
and unit testing.
Session 8: Package Development Tools (Part 2)We'll continue to explore tools for package develop-
ment in this lesson. In particular, we'll discuss how to
implement more robust checks, continuous integration
methods, vignettes, protocols for releasing a package
and best practices for including data.
Friday 29th. 09:30-17:30
Session 9: Package Development in Practice
With a baseline understanding of tools for package de-
velopment, we'll explore several case studies that further
enumerate the motivations and practical applications
of developing your own package. This session will also
feature time allocated for individualized research and
development on a project of your choosing.
Session 10: Next Steps
R is a dynamic resource, with new features being added
and new trends in how it is used as a programming
language. We'll conclude with an

WHERE Botanisches Museum, K onigin-Luise-Strae
6-8, Berlin
Instructors:
Dr. Federico Comoglio (Cambridge Institute for Medical
Research (UK))
Dr. Iros Barozzi (Imperial College London (UK))
Overview This course will introduce researchers and
technical workers to the bioinformatic analysis of large
epigenomic data sets obtained using Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS) technologies, with a focus on ChIP-
seq, RNA-seq and DNase-seq / ATAC-seq. The course162 EvolDir February 1, 2018
will cover the theoretical foundations of the most widely
adopted algorithms and analysis pipelines, a targeted
introduction to scripting in bash and R/BioConductor,
and extensive hands-on tutorials using publicly available
NGS data sets. At the end of this course, the students
should be able to eciently analyze their own data and
identify common pitfalls of genomics data analyses.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at researchers moving the rst steps
in epigenomic data analysis and / or interested in learn-
ing more about this subject. The course will oer a
balanced mixture of lectures and hands-on practical
tutorials using popular tools and R/BioConductor pack-
ages. Previous knowledge of genomics data formats from
Illumina sequencers and exposure to bioinformatics is
benecial but not a necessary prerequisite.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background
in biology and understand the central role of DNA for
biodiversity studies. No programming or scripting ex-
pertise is required and some basic introduction to UNIX-
based command line applications will be provided on
the rst day. However, some basic experience with using
command line and/or R is clearly an advantage as not
all the basics can be thoroughly covered in that short
amount of time. All hands-on exercises will be run in
UNIX-environments (Linux, Mac) on remote servers.
Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStudio.
Session content

logical system that will be used throughout this 5-days
course, where we will study dynamic chromatin changes
induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of
mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.
Session 2: Introduction to Linux and bash (morning)
In this session, we will provide a targeted introduction
to Linux and bash scripting, with a focus on the tools
required for the rest of the course. No previous exposure
to scripting is strictly required. Also, we will not at-
tempt to provide a catalogue of functions and command
syntax. Rather, we will focus on the principles and logic
of scripting.Session 3: R programming (afternoon)
In the afternoon, we will cover the basics of R program-
ming. This session will alternate short talks covering
the basics with extensive hands-on tutorials to allow
students without prior exposure to R to familiarize
themselves with this language in the most natural way.
This session aims at building a solid foundation of R
programming, and will also cover good coding practices
for reproducible research.

Berlin GeometricMorphometrics
5-9March deadline
Dear all,
registration deadline is soon approaching (10.02.18)
and we still have a few spots available for our course
\Geometric Morphometrics" ( https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course22/ )
Where: Berlin (Germany)
When: 5th-9th March 2018
Instructor: Dr. Carmelo Fruciano (ENS, Paris (France))
http://bit.ly/2rxQVFC Overview
Geometric morphometrics has become a standard in
biological research because it combines statistical rigour
and ease of interpretation. Through geometric morpho-
metrics, biological form is quantied, analysed and the
results are expressed as easily interpretable and visually
impactful shape changes. This course covers the main
common practices of modern geometric morphometrics,
including: acquiring data, analysing it, visualizing and
interpreting the results.
Format
The course will be delivered over ve days and will
comprise both lectures and hands-on sessions. The
lectures will cover both basic theoretical aspects and
their practical implementation in research practice and
software. During the hands-on sessions, the attendees
will have the chance of both using example datasets
and applying the knowledge acquired to their own data.
The course will be focused mainly on 2D data and on
easy-to-use software with graphical user interface to
maximize the ability to understand concepts and apply
them. However, some information on 3D data and on
R implementations will be provided, as appropriate.
Assumed Background
This course is aimed at beginners and intermediate users.
In other words, it is aimed at researchers who intend
to use geometric morphometrics or who have started
performing geometric morphometric analyses but feel
they need a more structured background.
Requirements
Attendees should have a background in biology and a
basic understanding of statistical concepts.Session content

Berlin RStatistics Jun18-22
Getting started with R [ https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course13/ ) 18-22 June
2018, Berlin (Germany) Application deadline is: May
20th, 2018.
Instructor: Dr. Alexandre Courtiol (Leibniz Institute for
Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin (Germany)) https://-
www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t40/ ) Overview:
R is the statistical software the most used in the world.
It is extremely powerful, free of charge and open source.
Despite these benets, many avoid R, or struggle with
it, as writing computer code to do any operation { a
requirement in R { is at rst both dicult and intimi-
dating.
This course aims at overcoming those challenges by
providing solid basics in R. At the end of the course,
participants should feel much more at ease writing a
computer script in the R language which covers the
entire spectrum of a statistical analysis: reading data,
editing them, plotting them, and analysing them. Be-
cause linear models are the dominant statistical tool in
many elds, the part of the course focussing on analyses
per se (see schedule) will focus on those, but principles
seen during the class should greatly help those inter-
ested in other kind of analyses as well. The course will
be presented over ve days and will mix explanations
and guided exercises. Students are free to practice with
their own datasets during the course.
Intended Audience & Assumed Background: This course
is aimed at scientists from quantitative sciences (e.g. bi-
ology, epidemiology, psychology...). It has been created
with biologists in mind but it should accommodate sci-
entists from other disciplines. No previous experience
with R is required. Participants should have a basic
familiarity with statistical terms and concepts.
Session content Monday 18th 'V Classes from 09:30
to 17:30 Monday is DATA day This rst day will be
dedicated to the data. R is software dedicated to data
analysis, so mastering the basics of data manipulation in
R is essential for further steps. It will be explained howto import data into R and how to manipulate them (e.g.
from adding or removing rows or columns, to merging
tables and using pivot tables). This will be good prac-
tice for students to learn the basics of the R language.
We will illustrate how to do everything using R base
(that is R out of the box), but we will also introduce
that allow users to perform some operations on large
datasets a little faster.
Tuesday 19th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Tuesday is
PLOTTING day Plotting is a crucial part of any data
analysis no matter how advanced you are in statistics.
It is important to visualise the data before the analysis
(e.g. to visually check the presence of potential errors
and for getting a sense of the distribution of the data),
during the analysis (e.g. to check the distribution of
model residuals), and after the analysis (to communicate
ndings in the most ecient way). Therefore, knowing
how to plot various kind of data matters a lot. We
will thus show how to plot dierent types of data in R
(points, distributions, rasters...) using dierent graphic
environments (e.g graphics, lattice, ggplot2).
Wednesday 20th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Wednes-
day is FUNCTIONS day As John Chambers { the grand-
father of R { put it Everything that happens in R is
a function call. That R allows for so-called functional
programming is one of its great benets: it allows the
implementation of any workow of statistical analysis
as the succession of simple clearly identied steps. Each
step is described by a function that takes an input and
generates an output. The output of one function is often
the input of the next. On this third day we will show
that creating one's own function is very very easy (yes,
even YOU can program!) and can be very very useful.
As a rst application we will create our own functions
to implement a randomisation test. As a second appli-
cation we will show how to create functions to perform
a power analysis (the estimation of the probability of
getting true positives when applying a test) for any
statistical test.
Thursday 21st 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Thursday
is LM day Many widely used statistical methods (t-tests,
anova, ancova, linear regressions...) are just dierent
type of Linear Models (LM), which is why LM represent
the most useful statistical toolbox to be familiar with if
you are in natural or social sciences. Fitting a LM in R
is easy { but building models, checking model assump-
tions, interpreting the outputs, and plotting predictions
correctly requires some know how. After refreshing the
most important concepts surrounding LM, we will go
through each of these steps in detail, working on real
datasets. It is important to understand LM quite well
before jumping into the more complex methods which
we will see on the next day.February 1, 2018 EvolDir 165

Email inquiries: CSU gdw@colostate.edu
Overview:
Title: Genomics of Disease in Wildlife: A Workshop
Location: Lory Conference Student Center, Colorado
State University, Fort Collins, CO
Dates: June 3-9, 2018
Website: https://www.gdwworkshop.colostate.edu/ Ap-
plication deadline: February 15, 2018.
Wildlife biodiversity can be drastically aected by the
outbreak and transmission of disease pathogens in both
natural habitats and ex situ populations. Recent tech-
nological advances in genomic sciences and increasingly
aordable Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay
costs have coalesced to result in powerful tools to moni-
tor, detect, and reconstruct the past, present and future
role of pathogens within wildlife biodiversity. This short
course will provide hands-on training for graduate level
and above researchers in wildlife disease related disci-
plines seeking to incorporate genomic data into their
projects. The course will be taught by a core group of
experts in genome data analyses with invited faculty
comprised of pre-eminent scientists performing cutting
edge of research in host-pathogen genomics in wildlife.
Why is the course needed?
Advances in genomic technology now provide an ex-
traordinary opportunity to rapidly assess the impact of
disease in wildlife biodiversity, management, and con-
servation. Wildlife researchers are uniquely positioned
to merge ecological, biological, and evolutionary studieswith genomic technologies to generate unprecedented
'Big Data' tools in disease research. The workshop will
provide a venue to accomplish this goal, will provide
networking opportunities for colleagues from intersect-
ing interests, and will advance genomic tools in wildlife
disease investigations.
How will the course address the need?
The course will provide essential training to wildlife
biologists, veterinarians, conservation managers, and
related experts to successfully incorporate NGS data
in wildlife research. Attendees will conduct hands-on
analyses of 'real world' genomic data of both host and
pathogen. The course will provide: (1) an overview of
current bioinformatics developments and approaches;
(2) guidance to implement genomic tools in study de-
sign; (3) NGS data analysis and interpretation; and, (4)
opportunities for interaction with peers, core faculty,
and invited experts.
Workshop Syllabus
The workshop will cover a typical workow com-
monly used in NGS analyses starting with the initial
raw sequence through the nal stages of identifying
host:pathogen variants linked with disease. Each day of
the workshop will cover an essential component of the
NGS workow in succession.
Morning sessions will be a series of instructional lec-
tures and demonstrations that will concisely present
the purpose, justication and implementation of the
specic workow unit. Short and exciting 'ash talks'
presented by CSU faculty will present some of their on-
going investigations using genomic tools in wildlife dis-
ease. The afternoon sessions will be computer-intensive
labs in which attendees will perform 'hands-on' anal-
yses with real-world genomic data for each workow
topic. Evening plenary lectures from invited faculty will
conclude each day's activities.
Teaching tools will include exercises using 'real-world'
NGS data from a range of pathogens and host species.
Participants will learn the importance of integrating
NGS data from both host and pathogen in order to
better understand current epidemics in wildlife.
For the duration of the course, each attendee will be
provided with a MacBook Pro computer and peripheral
equipment, and prepared genome datasets from several
host species and associated pathogens. These datasets
will be organized into various les and formats prior
to the course, demonstrate key concepts, and be the
foundation for computer exercises and teaching tools.

Europe MEME EvolutionaryBiology
Erasmus Mundus Master Program in Evolutionary Bi-
ology (MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master program
for talented and motivated students who are interested
in understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four Euro-
pean universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands;
University of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA). Together, this consortium has put together an
attractive multidisciplinary program that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at (at least)
two partner universities, and they will receive a double
degree from two partner universities they have attended.
A limited number of full scholarships is available for
European and non-European students and these will
be awarded in a selective procedure. Details on the
program and the selection procedure can be found on

Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop
Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington,
3-9 June 2018
Non-credit workshop. Participants arrive at Friday Har-
bor Labs on Sunday, June 3, lectures and exercises occur
June 4-8, and participants depart on Saturday, June 9,
2018.
Application deadline March 1, 2018. Details and links
to the application forms will be found here: http://-

shop will be found at http://blogs.uw.edu/fhleqg/ They
currently include a 2017 workshop schedule which has
links to the materials for that year's workshop.
Instructors: Dr. Joe Felsenstein, Dept. of Genome
Sciences and Dept. of Biology, University of Washing-
ton Dr. Stevan J. Arnold, Department of Integrative
Biology, Oregon State University
This workshop has been given yearly since 2011. Since
2017 it has been given at the Friday Harbor Laboratories
of the University of Washington, on San Juan Island.
The workshop will review the basics of theory in the eld
of evolutionary quantitative genetics and its connections
to evolution observed at various time scales. The aim
of the workshop is to build a bridge between the tradi-
tionally separate disciplines of quantitative genetics and
comparative methods.
Quantitative genetic theory for natural populations was
developed considerably in the period from 1970 to 1990
and up to the present, and it has been applied to a wide
range of phenomena including the evolution of dier-ences between the sexes, sexual preferences, life history
traits, plasticity of traits, as well as the evolution of
body size and other morphological measurements.
Phylogenetic approaches to comparative biology were
developed in the 1980s and 1990s, including inferring
how traits covary in evolution and how optimum values
of traits vary between species.
Textbooks have not kept pace with these developments,
and currently few universities oer courses on these
subjects aimed at evolutionary biologists.
Evolutionary biologists need to understand this eld
because of the ability to collect large amounts of data
by computer, the development of statistical methods for
changes of traits on evolutionary trees and for changes
in a single species through time, and the realization that
quantitative characters will not soon be fully explained
by genomics. This workshop aims to ll this need by
reviewing basic aspects of theory and illustrating how
that theory can be tested with data, both from single
species and from multiple-species phylogenies.
Participants will use R, an open-source statistical pro-
gramming language, to build and test evolutionary mod-
els.
The workshop involves lectures and in-class computer
exercises. You can consult the 2017 workshop website
for examples, using the links found at the 2017 schedule
mentioned above.
The intended participants for this workshop are grad-
uate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty
members in evolutionary biology. The workshop can
accommodate up to 30 participants. Guest instructors
are:
* Adam Jones, Biology, Texas A&M University, College

Univ. Hawai'i, Manoa * Brian O'Meara, Ecology & Evo-
lutionary Biology, Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville * Josef
Uyeda, Biological Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg
Cost: $1000, to be paid to Friday Harbor Laboratories.
This fee will cover housing and meals at FHL and all
other workshop expenses, except travel. Participants
who have been admitted to attend will make their pay-
ment prior to arrival at FHL. Details of payment by
credit card or check will be provided once the applicant

Deadline: March 27th, 2018
=== Topic =Evolution by natural selection has shaped
life over billions of years leading to the emergence of com-
plex organism capable of exceptional cognitive abilities.
These natural evolutionary processes have inspired the
development of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), which
are optimization algorithms widely popular due to their
eciency and robustness. Beyond their ability to opti-
mize, EAs have also proven to be creative and ecient
at generating innovative solutions to novel problems.
The combination of these two abilities makes them a
tool of choice for the resolution of complex problems.
There is evidence that the principle of selection on vari-
ation is at play in the human brain, as proposed in
Changeux???s and Edelman???s models of Neuronal
Darwinism, and more recently properly reformulated in
the theory of the Neuronal Replicators. Consequently,
the idea of an interaction between evolutionary pro-
cesses and cognition over physiological time scales has
been gaining some traction. Since the development of
human cognition requires years of maturation, it can be
expected that articial cognitive agents will also require
months if not years of learning and adaptation. It is in
this context that the optimizing and creative abilities of
EAs could become an ideal framework that complement,170 EvolDir February 1, 2018
aid in understanding, and facilitate the implementation
of cognitive processes. Additionally, a better under-
standing of how evolution can be implemented as part
of an articial cognitive architecture can lead to new
insights into cognition in humans and other animals.
The goals of the workshop are to depict the current
state of the art of evolution in cognition and to sketch
the main challenges and future directions. In particular,
we aim at bringing together the dierent theoretical and
empirical approaches that can potentially contribute
to the understanding of how evolution and cognition
can act together in an algorithmic way in order to solve
complex problems. In this workshop we welcome ap-
proaches that contribute to an improved understanding
of evolution in cognition using robotic agents, in silico
computation as well as mathematical models.

DESCRIPTION:
Study methods in population genomics have been pro-
foundly reshaped in the last few years thanks to the
growing availability of complete genomic sequences at
population level. The rapid and recent growth of data
and methods calls for new approaches to become routine
in evolutionary genomics laboratories. The objective of
this Practical Course is to give an overview of state of the
art methods in population genomics combining lectur-
ing from outstanding experienced population geneticists
and software developers. All conceptual innovation will
be presented in lectures and applied in practice both
individually and in group work.
Practicals include computer exercises supervised by
lecturers and training assistants. After attending the
course participants will be aware of up-to-date concepts
in population genetics, capable of running analyses using
software based on whole genome data sequences and able
to deal with basic aspects of any population genomics
project. This Practical Course aims at evolutionary
biologists who already have bioinformatics skills. PhD
students and Post-Doc researchers will benet the most
out of this course, but applications from all candidates
will be evaluated in their context.

May14-18
Dear Colleagues,
The Natural History Museum, London and BBSRC
are oering a one-week introductory course 'Integrat-
ing molecules with taxonomy and systematics: an in-
troductory molecular phylogenetics course for species
identication and evolutionary analysis', to run from
14-18th May 2018. The course will be taught by NHM
scientists and will benet anyone wishing to gain exper-
tise in molecular diagnostics and phylogenetic analysis
for systematic, taxonomic and ecological studies. Note
that this course assumes no prior experience with DNA
sequence analyses and is an introductory course. As
such, it is not appropriate for more advanced students.172 EvolDir February 1, 2018
More information can be found here: http:/-
/www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/courses-and-
students/integrating-molecules-with-taxonomy-and-
systematics.html Summary: A phylogeny is essential
for dening species boundaries, species identications,
recognition of cryptic species, testing systematic
hypotheses, identifying evolutionary and biogeographic
patterns and understanding the evolution of traits.
As such, knowing how to produce a robust tree is an
indispensable tool for modern taxonomists, systematists
and evolutionary biologists.
This one-week introductory-level course will teach par-
ticipants the steps involved to produce molecular phylo-
genies from raw Sanger and next-generation sequence
data (i.e. Illumina paired-end). By the time the partic-
ipants have completed the course, they will have had
theoretical and practical experience enabling them to i)
edit raw Sanger and NGS sequence data, ii) carry out
multiple sequence alignments, iii) choose appropriate
models of sequence evolution, iv) carry out phylogenetic
analyses (including Bayesian inference, maximum likeli-
hood), v) interpret tree topology and nodal support, vi)
produce publication ready trees, vii) work with public
sequence repositories, vii) assemble and annotate next
generation sequence data, and viii) recognise cryptic
species.
Venue and duration: The Natural History Museum,
London, UK. The course will run for one week, 9.30am-
6.00pm, 14-18th May 2018.
Eligibility and how to apply: The course is available to
anyone but please note that priority will be given to
applicants supported by BBSRC, working on a BBSRC
grant or based at a BBSRC institute. There are a max-
imum of 12 places available. The course is sponsored
by BBSRC and the NHM and we are charging only a
nominal fee of ' ~A300, which includes all course costs

Norwich GenomicsOfMeiosis Mar5
Workshop \Meisosis and beyond: understanding the
genomics before, during and after"
One-day workshop on 5th of March 2018 at the Earl-
ham Institute in Norwich, UK. Link to workshop web-
site: http://www.earlham.ac.uk/meiosis-and-beyond .
About:
Meiosis is the necessary consequence of sexual repro-
duction in eukaryotes. Despite its ubiquity we know
relatively little about the genomics of meiosis and what
happens before, during and after.
In this workshop, we aim to summarise the state-of-
the-art genomics view on the processes leading to, and
resulting from, meiosis across dierent taxa and identify
open questions. We will discuss how the most recent
sequencing technologies, including single-cell sequencing
technology or long-read, can help us to decipher the
unknowns of meiosis.
The workshop will be composed of oral presentations by
a combination of invited speakers and delegates and will
provide ample space for discussions. The outcome of the
workshop will be written up and published as a review
or perspective paper with participants as co-authors.
Target Audience:
Researchers using any model system with an interest
in processes linked with meiosis, interest in applying
recently developed genomic tools and Single-Cell se-
quencing in particular. Open to everybody.
Abstracts:
We welcome abstract submissions from all delegates,
both early career researchers and experienced. Abstracts
should include a title, list of authors with presenting
author in bold, aliations for authors and the main
body of the abstract must be no longer than 250 words.
Abstracts must be submitted in one of the following le
formats: .doc .docx .pdf to training@earlham.ac.uk
Deadline for abstract submission is: Monday 5th Febru-
ary at 17:00 GMT.
Abstracts will be reviewed and successful authors willFebruary 1, 2018 EvolDir 173
be contacted within 10 days of submission closing. Ab-
stracts will be selected based on scientic merit and
complementarity to the symposium themes. Successful
authors will be given a 15 minute slot comprising of 12
minute presentation and 3 minutes for questions. Speak-
ers will be asked to send their presentation in advance,
plus to bring a backup copy of the presentation in an
appropriate format (either USB or accessible from a
download site).
Prerequisites:
None though more benecial if you already have a
project in mind in experimental planning stages.

Introduction to Mixed (Hierarchical) models for biolo-
gists using R (IMBR01)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/introduction-
to-mixed-hierarchical-models-for-biologists-using-r-
imbr01/ Delivered by Prof. Subhash Lele from the
14th - 18th May 2018 at Orford Musique, Quebec,
Canada
Course overview: Mixed models, also known as hierar-
chical models and multilevel models, is a useful class
of models for many applied sciences, including biology,
ecology and evolution. The goal of this course is to
give a thorough introduction to the logic, theory and
most importantly implementation of these models to
solve practical problems in ecology. Participants are not
expected to know mathematics beyond the basic algebra
and calculus. Participants are expected to know some
R programming and to be familiar with the linear and
generalized linear regression. We will be using JAGS
(Just Another Gibbs Sampler) for Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) simulations for analyzing mixed models.
The course will be conducted so that participants havesubstantial hands-on experience.

Panama PolychaeteSystematics
Jul1-14
Systematics and Ecology of Caribbean Polychaete
Dates: 1 July - 14 July 2018
Location: Bocas Research Station, Bocas del Toro,
Panama
Instructors:
Leslie Harris, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles,
California
Sergio I. Salazar-Vallejo, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur,
Mexico
Luis Carrera-Parra, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Mex-
ico
Organizer: Dr. Rachel Collin
Registration Fee: $850 (includes room and board, STRI
registration fee, etc.). Some need-based fellowships are
available
Course Description
Polychaetes are under appreciated but highly impor-
tant components in marine ecosystems. The course is
aimed at graduate students, post-docs, or professionals
who work or plan to work on taxonomic and or ecologi-
cal studies with polychaetes in general and Caribbean
species in particular. The participants in this course
will:
Learn to collect, identify, and preserve the most com-
mon polychaetes in dierent substrates of the Bocas
del Toro region, such as mangrove roots, soft sediments,
and hard bottoms in coral reefs.Learn general biological and ecological characteristics
of the group.
Improve their taxonomic experience with tropical poly-
chaetes.
Improve their photographic skills to record pigmentation
patterns of living worms.
Learn the basics of taxonomic description and publica-
tion.
Learn museum standards for long-term care of wet-
preserved biological specimens.
Although polychaetes are largely unknown to most peo-
ple our understanding of the impacts of human activities
on the oceans can be monitored accurately only through
the careful study of these fascinating animals. Poly-
chaetes comprise a major animal lineage with well over
16,000 recognized species that occupy a wide range of
marine environments. They form a major component
of benthic communities from the intertidal to abyssal
depths, in soft sediments, coral reefs and other hard
substrates. Many members of this ancient group are
ecologically and economically important as ecosystem
engineers, as food sources for other organisms, as the
basis of commercial enterprises, as indicators of envi-
ronmental health, and as invasive or pest species. The
over 80 families of polychaetes show an amazing array
of body forms and sizes. As one of the few segmented
phyla, annelids are key to understanding the evolution
of bilaterian body plans.
Bocas del Toro has a rich polychaete fauna. To date
approximately 400 species have been found in the area,
about half of them described and half of them provi-
sional species in need of further identication. The
course will be most useful for students from the greater
Caribbean as most species are wide-spread through-out
the region but anyone wishing to gain experience with
the group will benet.
This course will last 13 day, split between eld collecting
and lab work. After the 2013 Bocas polychaete work-
shop the students were asked to evaluate the course.
Overall they preferred to spend as much time as pos-
sible learning the characters & techniques that would
enable them to proceed on their own after returning
home. Accordingly, the main focus here will be on ba-
sic systematics & ecology with a minor emphasis on
phylogeny. A pdf library of 1600+ publications on or
relevant to Caribbean polychaetes will be provided.
Daily activities will include 2 to 3 lectures, discussion,
and laboratory practice. Field trips will be arranged
with the station sta to visit at least once each of the dif-
ferent types of environments (soft sediments, mangrove,February 1, 2018 EvolDir 175
coral rocks, sandy beaches) near the Bocas Research
station to collect baseline data for conservation and for
future studies. Snorkeling will be part of the eld work
but not SCUBA. Those who want to dive can arrange
to do so through one of the local dive shops on their
day o.
During the second half of the course students will each
prepare descriptive species pages using specimen they
collect & photograph live. The pages will be incorpo-
rated into a photo ID guide for the use of station visitors,
students, outreach programs, and others.
Application: Please e-mail your CV, 1 letter of rec-
ommendation, and a 1-2 page statement explaining
your background and reasons for taking the course, to
bocasresearchstation@gmail.com before January 30th,
2018. Limit 12 students. To be considered for a
need-based fellowship, applicants should send a de-
scription of their need, their eorts to obtain fund-
ing from other available sources, and a travel budget.

UCLA/La Kretz Workshop in Conservation Genomics,
24 - 28 March, 2018
Conservation biology, genetics, and evolutionary biology
have had a long and intimate relationship, and conser-
vation constitutes one of the key applications of evolu-
tionary analysis to real-world biological problems. The
impacts of population and landscape genetics and gene
expression studies have been particularly striking, and
are helping to solve some of the most pressing problems
in biological conservation.As the eld of conservation
genetics continues to grow and mature, the availabilityof genome-scale data stand to make profound new con-
tributions to our ability to identify and protect at-risk
populations and recover those that are most endangered.
However, genomic analyses also carry a computational
burdendata sets are enormous, often require diverse
skills and approaches for assembly, quality control and
analysis.
The La Kretz annual workshop provides a comfort-
able, rigorous, and informal training environment for a
small group of motivated graduate students to explore
how conservation problems can best be addressed with
genomic-level data. Our goal is to provide hands-on ex-
perience in the ecient collection, troubleshooting, and
analysis of large data sets for conservation-relevant prob-
lems. One of the highlights of our workshop is active par-
ticipation from members of several governmental agen-
cies who are at the forefront of endangered species protec-
tion and management, providing a forum for exploring
the most relevant aspects of conservation genomics to
managers. The UCLA/La Kretz workshop is held at
the La Kretz Field Station (https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/-
santa-monica-mountains-research/) and Stunt Ranch
Reserve (http://stuntranch.ucnrs.org/) in the heart of
the Santa Monica Mountains. Only 30 miles from UCLA
and the LAX airport, but nestled in the relatively unde-
veloped 160,000 acre Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area, the Field Station/Stunt Reserve pro-
vides an ideal location to explore new developments in
genomic science and pressing needs in conservation and
management together in a single setting.
Our current instructor list, drawn from UCLA faculty
and several other partner institutions, includes: Ben
Fitzpatrick (U. Tennessee Knoxville), Kirk Lohmueller
(UCLA), Evan McCartney-Melstad (UCLA), Ian Wang
(UC Berkeley), Brad Shaer (UCLA), Victoria Sork
(UCLA), Bob Wayne (UCLA), Ying Zhen (UCLA),
Erin Toelmier (UCLA), Alice Mouton (UCLA), De-
vaughn Fraser (UCLA), Emily Curd (UCLA), Zach Gold
(UCLA).
Agency partners represented include: US Geological Sur-
vey, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife
Service, and the California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife.
Topics covered include:
Overview of traditional conservation genetics
Next generation platforms: the best tool for the job
Data management pipelines:
Quality Control
Data storage
Data organization178 EvolDir February 1, 2018
Data types and analyses:

Sequences
Exploring very large data sets
Functional genomic data
RNA-seq
RADseq pipelines, from raw reads to analyzing data
Genomic data and GIS
Visualizing geographic structure and demographic his-
tory
Admixture, clines, and hybridization
Detecting adaptive variation
RNAseq in a conservation context
eDNA: promise and reality
PREREQUISITES
Available housing limits course enrollment to ~20 stu-
dents. Preference will be given to masters and doctoral
candidates who are in the early to middle stages of their
thesis research, and who have some familiarity with us-
ing a command line interface or programming languages
(i.e. Perl, python etc.). We also welcome applications
from postdocs, faculty, and government researchers, al-
though our top priority is graduate student applicants.
We encourage applications from women, minorities, and
individuals from under-represented demographics in the
sciences.
ADMISSION AND FEES Applicants will be admitted
based on academic qualications and appropriateness of
research interests. The course fee is $425 USD. This in-
cludes food and lodging at the La Kretz Field Station, as
well as all incidental fees, for the duration of the course
(arriving Saturday March 24, departing Thursday March
29). Like last year, the workshop is co-sponsored by a
UC Catalyst program grant, which will provide some
student support and stang. University of California
students from any campus may apply for partial sup-
port (up to $225) from the Conservation Genomics Con-
sortium (https://ucconservationgenomics.eeb.ucla.edu/)
funded under the UC Catalyst program. To do so, sim-
ply note in your application that you would like to apply
for this partial support. UCLA students

Mar19-23
PS statistics are running a course aimed specically at
analysing behavioural data and is therefor highly rele-
vant to those studying the evolution of behaviour (both
human and animal)
\Behavioural data analysis using maximum likelihood in
R (BDML01)"
https://www.psstatistics.com/course/behavioural-data-
analysis-using-maximum-likelihood-bdml01/ This
course is being devilled by Dr Will Hoppitt and will
run from 19th - 23rd March 2018 in Glasgow
Course Overview: This 5-day course will involve a com-
bination of lectures and practical sessions. Students
will learn to build and t custom models for analysing
behavioural data using maximum likelihood techniques
in R. This exible approach allows a researcher to a) use
a statistical model that directly represents their hypoth-
esis, in cases where standard models are not appropriate
and b) better understand how standard statistical mod-
els (e.g. GLMs) are tted, many of which are tted
by maximum likelihood. Students will learn how to
deal with binary, count and continuous data, including
time-to-event data which is commonly encountered in
behavioural analysis.
1) After successfully completing this course students
should be able to: 2) t a multi-parameter maximum
likelihood model in R 3) derive likelihood functions for
binary, count and continuous data 4) deal with time-
to-event data 5) build custom models to test specic
behavioural hypotheses 6) conduct hypothesis tests and
construct condence intervals 7) use Akaike's informa-
tion criterion (AIC) and model averaging 8) understand
how maximum likelihood relates to Bayesian techniques

Geometric Morphometrics Using R (GMMR01)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/geometric-
morphometrics-using-r-gmmr01/ This course is being
delivered by Prof. Dean Adams, Prof. Michael
Collyer and Dr. Antigoni Kaliontzopoulou | This
course will run from 19th - 23rd February 2018 at
Margam Discovery Centre, Wales, UK. | The eld
of geometric morphometrics (GM) is concerned with
the quantication and analysis of patterns of shape
variation, and its covariation with other variables. Over
the past several decades these approaches have become
a mainstay in the eld of ecology, evolutionary biology,
and anthropology, and a panoply of analytical tools for
addressing specic biological hypotheses concerning
shape have been developed. The goal of this is to
provide participants with a working knowledge of
the theory of geometric morphometrics, as well as
practical training in the application of these methods.
| The course is organized in both theoretical and
practical sessions. The theoretical sessions will provide
a comprehensive introduction to the methods of
landmark-based geometric morphometrics, which aims
at providing the participants with a solid theoretical
background for understanding the procedures used in
shape data analysis. Practical sessions will include
worked examples, giving the participants the oppor-
tunity to gain hands-on experience in the treatment
of shape data using the R package geomorph. These
sessions focus on the generation of shape variables from
primary landmark data, the statistical treatment of
shape variation with respect to biological hypotheses,180 EvolDir February 1, 2018
and the visualization of patterns of shape variation
and of the shapes themselves for interpretation of
statistical ndings, using the R language for statistical
programming. While practice datasets will be available,
it is strongly recommended that participants come
with their own datasets. | Note: Because this is a
geometric morphometrics workshop in R, it is required
that participants have some working knowledge in
R. The practical sessions of the course will focus on
GM-based analyses, and not basic R user-interfacing.
It is therefore strongly recommended that participants
refresh their R skills prior to attending the workshop. |

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
