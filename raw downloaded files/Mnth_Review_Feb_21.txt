Annual Conference Online of the Microbiology SocietyFebruary 1, 2021 EvolDir 5
on Wednesday, 28th of April (14:00 - 17:00 UK time).
This session, under the umbrella of Protistology-UK,
will complement the new UK initiative \Darwin Tree
of Life Project", which aims to sequence and annotate
the genomes of 66,000 UK species of animals, plants
protists and fungi. This initiative is part of the \Earth
BioGenome Project", which targets to sequence all 1.5
million known eukaryotic species on earth. Protists
and fungi are the main contributors to this list and
we will explore their vast diversity, not only within
the UK, but globally. We are inviting speakers to
discuss which branches of the eukaryotic tree of life
have been over/underestimated based on recent metage-
nomics data and which regions have been under-sampled
to explore the evolution of potentially new branches of
the eukaryotic tree.
Invited speakers include: Prof. Neil Hall (Earlham In-
stitute, UK) Prof. Patrick Keeling (UBC, Canada) Dr.

** Doctoral position on termite genomics. Deadline for
applications: 1st February 2021 **
A 3-year doctoral position (TVL-13, 65%) is available at
the Institute of Biology of the Freie Universit at Berlin.
The position is part of a project funded by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) that aims to take ad-
vantage of recent developments in genomic sequencing
to gain new insights into a major milestone in evo-
lution: the emergence of sociality. The transition to
sociality that exists across termites and their nearest
cockroach relatives represents a powerful framework for
understanding the genomic changes behind this signi-
cant evolutionary transition. The main objective of the
project is to sequence, assemble and annotate platinum-
grade genomes from a range of representative species
spanning the origin and subsequent diversication of
termites. These data will be used to investigate the
molecular mechanisms underpinning the evolution of
termite eusociality and to elucidate the origins of ter-
mite division of labour. Genomes will be combined
with transcriptomic as well as proteomic data to further
explore the evolutionary origins of termite sociality.
The project will be carried out as a close collaboration
between Prof. Dino McMahon (FU Berlin) and Dr.
Mark Harrison from the University of M unster.
Responsiblities: Research in the eld of genomics, with
emphasis on genomic drivers of termite sociality; Prepa-
ration and analysis of transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and
genomic data: Programming in R and Python / Statis-
tical data analysis; Design of experiments (experimental
design) and formulation of hypotheses; Preparation and
execution of experiments; Working with live insects;
Familiarization with project-related literature.
Qualications for an application are a Bachelor and
Master's degree (or soon to be competed) in natural
sciences. Other desirable qualications: background /
strong interest in genome research and evolution; labora-
tory experience with molecular biology; good knowledge
in programming; uency in spoken and written English;
good team and communication skills; ability to work
independently; Experience: Completed projects or in-
ternships on research relevant topics are an advantage.
Applications should be written in English and include

ConservationGenomics
The Emel lab https://sarahemel.weebly.com/ is seeking
a motivated master's student to take part in funded re-
search on Appalachian cottontail conservation genomics
at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP). A 2-year
Research Assistantship to cover tuition and stipend
is available. This position starts in Fall 2021 in In-
diana, PA, with an opportunity for related remote or
on-campus employment in Summer 2021.
Appalachian cottontails have specic forested habitat
requirements and are restricted to ridgetops in the
Appalachian mountains, making them susceptible to
changes in human land use patterns and other distur-
bances. In collaboration with the labs of Je Larkin
and Joe Duchamp at IUP, this interdisciplinary project
aims to determine the current status of this species,
along with snowshoe hare, in the state of Pennsylvania,
and to evaluate the genetic and ecological responses to
landscape change and management practices. To study
patterns of genetic diversity and gene ow across the
landscape, the Emel lab is developing genomic tools for
high-throughput species identication and SNP geno-
typing of native Lagomorphs.
The master's student will be instrumental in developing
and applying these genomic tools to assess genetic struc-
ture and diversity. As a result, they will gain experience
in the molecular laboratory methods, bioinformatics,
and analysis of genomic data, with potential extensions
depending on research interests. There will also be
eldwork opportunities if desired.
The IUP MS in Biology https://www.iup.edu/biology/-
grad/ oers coursework in molecular genetics, statistics,
ecology, evolutionary biology, and special topics includ-
ing landscape/conservation genetics. Graduates of the
program go on to top PhD programs, state and federal
agencies, non-governmental conservation organizations,February 1, 2021 EvolDir 9

BehaviouralEvolution
*Ecology and evolution of social impact and responsive-
ness in a wild sparrow population* Two PhD-positions
in Behavioral Ecology at LMU Munich. Application
deadline: 28.02.2021
*Project description *
Social interactions characterize all wild populations and
aect evolution whenever heritable traits are plastic in
response to heritable traits of conspecics. The evolu-
tion of \social responsiveness" to and \social impact"
on other' ^As phenotypes has attracted theoretical atten-
tion, but progress requires addressing key outstanding
questions: Do wild populations contain individual vari-
ation in degrees of social impact and responsiveness?
Does selection act on this variation, and which processes
maintain it? These key challenges will be addressed in
a research programme to understand social evolution.
The overarching aim is to combine the strengths of
cutting-edge behavioural ecology and quantitative ge-
netics theory to uniquely study the interplay betweensocial interactions and social selection in the wild. We
will focus on social foraging strategies in house sparrows
on Norwegian islands that use either private informa-
tion and actively nd food (\producers' ^A) or social
information to exploit food patches found by others
("scroungers\). Game theory predicts socially respon-
sive shifts towards scrounging when others produce,
and vice versa. Using innovative high-throughput be-
havioural screening of entire populations, we aim to
assay >600 birds for their producer-scrounger social im-
pact and responsiveness in >4,000 assays and determine
genomic relatedness, survival, and reproductive tness
for all individuals. We will address the following key
objectives:
*PhD-project 1* will establish whether individuals are
repeatable in (i) average level of producing-scrounging
("personality\), (ii) level of adjustment in producing-
scrounging to phenotypes expressed by partners ("social
responsiveness\) and (iii) producing-scrounging elicited
in partners ("social impact\). We will quantify co-
variances between these ' ^Atraits' ^A, describe (social)
environmental sources of variation within and among
individuals, and test for covariances with various key
behavioural (aggression, exploratory tendency) and mor-
phology traits (body size and shape) predicted by adap-
tive theory. *PhD-project 2* will quantify how natural
selection acts on producing-scrounging reaction norms
and study whether selection pressures covary with key
socioecological conditions; and thus determine the path-
ways (components of tness) by which selection acts on
this variation in the social phenotype in this well-studied
system. This will make it possible to start exploring
the potential evolutionary consequences of selection on
social impact and responsiveness in the wild, thereby
providing crucial new insights into the evolution of social
behaviour and the role of social interactions in ecological
and evolutionary processes.
*Research and Project group* The PhD-students will
be embedded in the Behavioural Ecology Group of the
Ludwig Maximilian' ^As University of Munich, located in
Martinsried. The group works broadly on two topics:
individual behaviour and life-history (Prof. NJ Dinge-
manse) and pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection
(Dr. C Tuni). Our group consists of ve PhD-students
and two postdocs, oering a dynamic social environ-
ment. The PhD-projects are part of a collaboration
with the Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics at NTNU
(Trondheim). International collaborators: Profs. B-E
Saether, H Jensen, T-H Ringsby, J Wright (NTNU),
Prof. A. Wilson (Exeter) and Prof. J. Morrand-Ferron
(Ottowa). PhD-students have the opportunity to apply
for admission to the International Research School for
Organismal Biology of the Max Planck Institute for Or-10 EvolDir February 1, 2021
nithology, which oers high-quality teaching programs
for PhD-students and ample opportunity for networking
and collaboration.
*Requirements * The two successful candidates should
have background training in evolutionary biology and
behavioural ecology. We are looking for candidates that
have experience with eldwork, bird handling, and are
able to work independently. Coding skills are required
for programming electronics equipment (sophisticated
PIT-tag readers) and performing complex statistical
analyses (e.g. multivariate animal models to estimate
IGEs). Social skills and ability to ourish in a team are
important for winter eldwork in Norway and various
collaborative aspects. Successful candidates speak uent
English. Command of Norwegian is a pro.
*Project duration and starting date* Successful candi-
dates will be oered a three-year PhD-position funded
by a grant of the German Science Foundation to Prof.
NJ Dingemanse. Starting date is 01.09.2021.
*Application package* Candidates should send a moti-
vation letter and CV to Prof. N. Dingemanse

ecological-impacts-of-invasive-alien-insects-at-multiple-
levels-from-genes-to-communities/ Predicting the
ecological impacts of invasive alien insects at multiple
levels: from genes to communities
Biological invasions are global phenomena that impact
ecosystems, the economy and human, animal and plant
health (1). The rate at which biological invasions occur
has grown exponentially in recent times, due to global
trade that has increased the pathways for organisms to
be transported across the globe at unprecedented speed
(2). It is therefore of high importance to understand
in advance the impact that alien organisms might pose
to the ecosystems that they invade (3). Among inva-
sive animals, top predators are of particular interest, asthey directly impact on a wide range of organisms that
they prey upon, and also cascade their eects indirectly
through, for example, enemy release.
In this PhD project, the student will adopt a series
of experimental approaches, that span from molecular
methods to behavioural and community analyses, to
characterize whether key traits of insect top predators
have shifted after biological invasions and also their
actual and predicted impacts on ecosystems. The stu-
dent will comparatively analyse two high prole insect
invaders: the Asian hornet Vespa velutina (a recent
invader) and the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis
(established in Europe). Hence, the two systems present
a great opportunity to compare key ecological traits
associated with a relatively \old" invasion (Harmonia)
vs. a more recent one (Vespa), with an enhanced poten-
tial to predict the type of impact that these two insects
might have across invaded ecosystems.
The student will perform eld work in the UK, Europe
and North America to sample insects of the two species
from dierent populations representing a gradient in
their history of invasion, and they will perform experi-
ments in the lab to test behavioural and physiological
traits that could be associated with successful invasions.
Two traits will be prioritised: feeding behaviour/ecology
and immunocompetence. Feeding analyses will combine
density dependent patterns of prey consumption and
preference (3) with stable isotope analyses and DNA
metabarcoding, to characterize the composition of the
diet of the two insects at a broader scale, and also with a
high-throughput metagenomic approach to identify prey
items at the highest resolution. For immunocompetence,
a candidate gene approach will be used to characterize
the expression patterns of key genes associated with
constitutive and induced responses. This experimental
approach will lay the ground for a statistical analysis to
model the impact that Vespa and Harmonia are having
on the ecosystem. This will be followed by another
modelling approach to predict how top predators could
impact UK ecosystems over time.
The project will provide a unique opportunity to inter-
act with a supervisory team of scientists who display
a wide range of expertise and share the same passion
for the ecology of invasive alien species. In particular,
the candidate will work under the supervision of Prof
Dick (Belfast) and Prof Roy (CEH Wallingford) who
are leading experts in the eld of invasion biology, Dr
Lawson-Handley (Hull) and Dr Manfredini

UBasel AlpinePlantEvolution
PhD position in Alpine Ecology/Plant Evolution, Uni-
versity of Basel, Switzerland A 4-year PhD position
(100%) is available in the group of Plant Ecology
and Evolution at the University of Basel, Switzerland
(https://duw.unibas.ch/en/ecoevo/). Research in the
group focuses on the extent to which climate adaptation
is possible, what the sources of evolutionary constraints
are, and how they will aect future species distribution
under global warming.
The evolutionary causes of elevational range limits are
poorly known. Theory points to changes in the se-
lection regime and genetic limitations. The selection
regime may be important if environmental gradients are
multivariate or steep at the lower and upper limit of el-
evational distribution. Genetic limits may arise because
of low genetic variation in individual environmental tol-
erances or because of genetic correlations antagonistic
to the direction of selection.
Your Tasks: Working with a few alpine and lowland
plant species, the student will perform eld surveys on
species distribution, population genetic analyses and
the study of selection in nature. Fieldwork will be an
important part of the project and take place in Switzer-
land, in collaboration with research partners at other
Swiss universities.
Your Prole: Candidates should have an enthusiastic
interest in plants, their ecology and evolution, and a
strong background in quantitative thinking, experimen-
tal design, statistical analysis/bioinformatics, and rear-
ing plants. Applicants must have a university degree in
natural sciences that allows entrance to a PhD program
(ideally in ecology or evolutionary biology), and very
good organizational, analytical, and scientic writing
skills. Applicants should have a driver' ^As license.
We oer: The project is based at the Department of
Environmental Sciences, University of Basel, Switzer-
land. The Department oers a stimulating environment,
including a rich spectrum of research activities in life
sciences (plant ecology, population genetics, evolution-
ary biology, plant physiology and molecular and cell
biology). Students will be enrolled in the PhD program
of the Z ^A^A1rich-Basel Plant Science Center. Basel is
a mid-sized Swiss city, well connected and oering abroad range of cultural and recreational activities. Ideal
starting date is March 2021 but is open to negotiation.
Contact: For more information, contact Yvonne Willi
(yvonne.willi@unibas.ch). Motivated applicants should
submit (1) a one-page letter that summarizes interests
and relevant experience, (2) their CV, (3) copies of un-
dergraduate and masters/diploma transcripts, and (4)
contact information of two references (all as a ***single
PDF***) to: franziska.grob@unibas.ch. Applications
are welcome until the position is lled and will be re-
viewed starting on February 15, 2021.

UBern EvolutionaryGenomics
4-year PhD position in Evolutionary Genomics in Bern,
Switzerland
A PhD position is available to work with Dr Milan Ma-
linsky (https://www.milan-malinsky.org) in the context
of his Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) funded
project to study evolution of recombination rates. The
position is based at the Institute of Ecology and Evo-
lution at the University of Bern, Switzerland, is fully
funded for 4 years including student fees and a generous
stipend, and is open to applicants worldwide.
Recombination is a fundamental genetic process. It con-
tributes to generating the genetic diversity upon which
natural selection acts and mechanistically it ensures
proper formation of sperm and egg cells. Studies of ne-
scale distribution of recombination along chromosomes,
and how this is regulated, have so far been possible
only in a limited number of species. This is now chang-
ing. In this project, we are going to construct ne-scale
recombination maps for over 30 species to (i) explore
links between recombination and genetic dierentiation
in pairs of populations or closely related species; and
(ii) to follow up on preliminary results suggesting the
mechanisms for specifying recombination hot-spots in
a large group of shes (Percomorpha) may be distinct
from other vertebrates.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with
a strong interest in evolutionary biology, genetics, ge-
nomics, and bioinformatics. Candidates should hold a
Master' ^As degree, demonstrate scientic curiosity, ini-
tiative, problem-solving skills, and be able to condently
communicate in English. On the technical side, de-
nite advantages include strong numeracy, understandingFebruary 1, 2021 EvolDir 13
of statistics and probability, and previous experience
with computer scripts/coding. We are committed to
increasing diversity, equity and inclusiveness in evolu-
tionary biology and would like to especially encourage
applications from underrepresented groups.
Milan is a young new PI, oering close focus on the
project and supervision of the PhD candidate, while the
project benets from access to large unique genomic
datasets and a world-class network of collaborators, in-
cluding Ole Seehausen (formal co-supervisor) and Katie
Peichel in Bern; Richard Durbin in Cambridge, UK;
Walter Salzburger in Basel, Switzerland; and Molly
Przeworski at the Columbia University in New York.
There is the potential for the PhD candidate to spend
up to eight months visiting at the Prof. Przeworski' ^As
lab in New York within the framework of this collabora-
tion. Bern itself is within a short distance of some of
the most iconic peaks of the Swiss Alps.
Applications should include a motivation letter, a CV,
and contact details for at least two referees and should
be sent, ideally as a single PDF document, to Milan
Malinsky (millanek@gmail.com). The start date for the
PhD is between 1st April 2021 and 30th September 2021,
to be agreed with the successful applicant. Screening of
applications will commence immediately and continue
until the position is lled.

Job description: The VIB - UGent Center for Plant Sys-
tems Biology, Department of Plant Biotechnology and
Bioinformatics and the Department Biology from Ghent
University is oering a PhD scholarship (R1-level) in
2021 for an evolutionary biologist with strong interest
in the modelling of eco-evolutionary dynamics 'V the
dynamic interaction between ecological and evolutionary
processes at contemporary timescales.
Polyploidy, i.e. the possession of multiple sets of chro-
mosomes that results from whole-genome duplication
(WGD), is a widespread phenomenon mainly associ-
ated with plants but has also been found in numerous
insects and vertebrates. WGD is historically viewed
as a source of novel genetic variation across the en-
tire genome that allows fast adaptation to changing
habitats. Multiple disadvantages do however constrain
these adaptive capacities and evidence is accumulating
that species with WGD may predominantly invade and
persist under stress. In many species, whole genome
duplication is associated with an increase in cell and/or
body size, and mass-specic metabolism. The success of
polyploidization is therefore anticipated to be governed
by physiological responses that directly mediate ecologi-
cal and evolutionary processes. The PhD student will
study these dynamics interactions by means of ODE
(Ordinary Dierential Equation) and individual based
models.
The PhD student will be part of a vibrant interdisci-
plinary research group lead by Prof. Van de Peer and
Prof. Dries Bonte. The successful candidate will be ex-
pected to tightly collaborate with colleagues in related
scientic disciplines using experimental evolution and
genomics.
Job prole: Candidates should have a strong background14 EvolDir February 1, 2021
in ecological/evolutionary modelling and/or computa-
tional biology. Applicants should have a keen interest
in the tight coupling between demographic and evolu-
tionary processes. The position is available for a 4-years
period, pending a positive intermediate evaluation. Ap-
plicants demonstrate excellent study results and good
English skills. We expect the PhD student to provide
some assistance in the group' ^As regular teaching activi-
ties. As criteria for the assessment of your qualication,
emphasis will also be laid on previous publications (if
any) and relevant experience. We aim to hire students
that reect the diversity of society and thus welcome
applications from all qualied candidates regardless of

Job description
The Department Biology of Ghent University is oer-
ing a PhD scholarship (R1-level) in 2021 commencing
latest on July1st. The PhD student will be hosted
at both the EON (Research group Evolution and
Optics of Nanostructures, https://www.ugent.be/we/-
biology/en/research/eon) and TEREC (Terrestrial Ecol-ogy, https://www.ugent.be/we/biology/en/research/-
terec) research group. Supervision by prof. Dries Bonte
(Dries.Bonte@Ugent.be) and dr. Bram Vanthournout
(Bram.Vanthournout@Ugent.be). Urbanisation leads to
a strong homogenisation of biodiversity, as many species
go extinct while few species are able to persist in cities
across the world. This persistence is caused by tolerance
or adaptations towards stressors like urban heating and
altered resources. Orb web spiders are predators that
experience strong changes in prey composition but also
a performance reduction due to thermal stress. Changes
in body colouration are an important adaptation to
thermal conditions, but they are constrained by nutri-
tional conditions. As city life would select for paler
colouration, reduced costs of producing pigments may
provide an explanation for rescue under poor nutritional
conditions in urban environments.
The student will participate in a research project funded
by the Research Foundation ??? Flanders (FWO) and
study the interplay between thermal and nutritional
urban selection pressures in the garden spider. This
will be achieved by a further development of an on-
going citizen-science project (www.spiderspotter.com),
combined with an extended survey of prey availability
and nutritional quality in a research platform in Flan-
ders and the quantication of body colouration across
urban gradients in Europe. Targeted translocation ex-
periments will subsequently allow understanding of the
adaptive value of these phenotypic changes, as well as
the potential for genetic evolution.
Job prole
Candidates should have a strong background in relevant
subjects such as thermal, food web or urban ecology and
evolution. Experience in conducting biological experi-
ments or molecular analyses using arthropods (spiders)
as a model is seen as an advantage. Applicants should
have a keen interest/prior experience in citizen science
and science communication in general. The position is
available for a 4-years period, pending a positive inter-

PhD studentship, Department of Ecology and Evolution,
University of Lausanne, Switzerland
A PhD studentship in plant evolutionary biology is
available in the research group of John Pannell in the
Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of
Lausanne. The student will consider the evolution and
ecology of dispersal in the context of plant sexual sys-
tems, but the precise nature and focus of the student's
research will depend on his or her specic interest. The
project may include a mix of empirical research on,
and theoretical modelling of, the evolution of disper-
sal at dierent spatial scales in the context of dierent
life histories and reproductive systems. Empirical as-
pects may range from considerations of the biophysics of16 EvolDir February 1, 2021
short-range dispersal in one or more plant species with
specialised dispersal mechanisms, to the characterisation
of dispersal kernels under controlled and eld conditions
using genetic markers. Theoretical work, which would
be jointly supervised by Charles Mullon in the same
department, could extend to considerations of dispersal
and kin selection. The project will integrate into cur-
rent research in the lab on conict between male and
female components of reproduction and dispersal, on
adaptations that (partially) resolve such conict, and on
the evolution of sex chromosomes: for details and a list
of publications, see https://www.unil.ch/dee/pannell-
group . Research scope and skills sought
The student's specic research will be tailored to his or
her background, interests and personal training objec-
tives. He or she should be able to demonstrate a strong
interest in evolutionary ecology and/or population genet-
ics. Experience and an interest in working with plants
is not essential but could be an advantage, e.g., includ-
ing managing glasshouse, common garden and/or eld
experiments. The successful candidate should also have
good communication and interpersonal skills, an ability
to work in a team, and a willingness to contribute to
the Department's teaching.
Host department and university
The Department of Ecology and Evolution hosts a broad
range of research groups, and its members enjoy a lively
intellectual and social life. Although the University of
Lausanne is francophone, the department is highly in-
ternational, and all its research activity and seminars

Applicants are invited for a fully-funded PhD stu-

laboration with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
starting Sep/Oct 2021. Deadline for application: Jan-
uary 13th 2021. Funding is now available for both UK
and international students.

evolution-of-mimicry-in-a-changing-world-how-shifting-
bumblebee-communities-aect-selection-on-a-colour-
polymorphic-hovery-2/ Complex species interactions
make the impacts of global environmental change
dicult to foresee. Understanding the ecological and
evolutionary relationships between species, and the way
that the tness of a species is aected by changes in
community composition, is essential to predict shifts
in species distributions and patterns of biodiversity.18 EvolDir February 1, 2021
In this project, we will investigate a fascinating
interaction between an important group of pollinators
and their charismatic parasite, with the ultimate aim of
predicting the consequences of environmental change
for the species concerned. Along the way, we will
gain some valuable insights into the genetic origins of
Batesian mimicry. The project involves an unusual
combination of practical ecology and behaviour, species
distribution modelling, and cutting-edge genomics.
Larvae of the hovery Volucella bombylans infest the
nests of bumblebees. They eat bumblebee brood cells,
pollen stores and detritus, but the impact on host t-
ness, and hence the degree of parasitism, is not known.
Adult ies display a striking colour polymorphism, with
individuals resembling dierent bumblebee species. We
think they are Batesian mimics, fooling predators into
thinking that palatable and harmless ies are heavily-
defended and unpalatable. In the era of species distri-
bution modelling and genome sequencing, this system
provides unique opportunities to address two fascinating
research questions. Firstly, how will global environmen-
tal change aect the relationship between a putative
parasite and its hosts, when those hosts also act as
a model for mimicry? Secondly, which genes are re-
sponsible for Batesian mimicry, and how is selection
on those genes inuenced by variation in community
composition?
The successful applicant will conduct eld sampling,
laboratory experiments, genomic analysis and species
distribution modelling, with the focus of the work being
shaped by the student's interests. They will work with a
cross-disciplinary supervisory team, and receive training
in entomology, bioinformatics and modelling.
Essential: The student should hold at least a good un-
dergraduate degree or equivalent in a biological science;
they should have experience of ecology, evolutionary bi-
ology and genetics; they should have practical research
project experience and laboratory skills.
Highly desirable: A Masters-level qualication in a rele-
vant subject area; full UK-compatible driving licence;
experience of statistical/mathematical modelling; expe-
rience of practical entomology; experience of PCR and
other basic molecular laboratory skills.

PlantDiseaseEpidemiologyEvolution
PhD studentship, University of Reading, UK, open to
UK, EU, and international students. Deadline 8 Febru-
ary 2021.
Title: \Smart control of crop diseases: how can we best
combine fungicides and plant resistance genes?"
About the project:
This multidisciplinary PhD project will investigate the
epidemiology and evolutionary adaptation of the ma-
jor fungal pathogen of wheat Zymoseptoria tritici (Zt)
to control measures { fungicides and disease resistance
genes, thereby using evolutionary biology to tackle one of
the most urgent problems in agriculture. The methodol-
ogy combines mathematical modelling, machine learning
and eld experimentation.
Zt causes septoria tritici blotch (STB), the most dam-
aging disease of wheat in Europe and one of the largest
constraints on wheat production globally. The disease
is especially serious in the UK because of conducive
climatic conditions. It is becoming increasingly dicult
to control STB, because Zt is capable of rapidly evolving
resistance to fungicides and adapting to disease-resistant
wheat varieties and environmental conditions. It is rec-
ognized that no single control measure is durable in
the face of the pathogen's notorious adaptive capacity,
hence the two key control methods - fungicides and
disease resistance genes in wheat - need to be combined
in a manner that optimizes not only control ecacy
in the short term, but also their sustainability in the
longer term. This interdisciplinary project will make a
major contribution to this goal using a powerful com-
bination of large-scale eld experimentation with novel
high-throughput phenotyping techniques, bioinformatic
analyses, state-of-the-art machine learning and mathe-
matical modelling approaches.
In the rst phase, a eld experiment will be conducted
during two consecutive years to investigate the STB epi-
demic development in a large number of dierent wheat
genotypes. The amount of disease will be measured us-
ing both the conventional visual assessments and novel
digital phenotyping approaches, and the daily weather
data will be recorded. The data on epidemic develop-
ment will be linked to genomic data already available for
the wheat population under study, and in this way youFebruary 1, 2021 EvolDir 19
are likely to identify new genetic bases of STB resistance
in wheat. In the second phase, powerful machine learn-
ing techniques will be used to combine the three types
of data (disease measurements, weather data and wheat
genomic data) and construct a model predicting the sea-
sonal STB epidemic development. Finally, in the third
phase of the project, the outcomes of the two previous
phases will be incorporated into a mathematical mod-
elling framework (epidemiological/evolutionary model)
that describes how the pathogen population changes
over time in its interaction with the host population of
wheat plants. The model will incorporate the eect of
two control measures: fungicides and STB resistance
genes in wheat. This will allow you to optimize choices
of fungicide treatment programmes and disease-resistant
wheat cultivars that maximize net benet of growers
over a short term of a single growing season. You will
then be able to compare the outcomes with the pre-
dicted net benet over a longer term of a number of
consecutive growing seasons, taking into account disease
levels, weather variables and wheat genomes.
Training opportunities:
The student will acquire inter-disciplinary skills in de-
signing and conducting large-scale eld experiments
with crop pathogens, acquiring large datasets with the
help of novel digital phenotyping approaches, use ma-
chine learning and mathematical modelling to extract
knowledge from data. The student will receive extensive
training by the supervisory team in computer program-
ming to handle large and complex data sets and conduct
mathematical and computational modelling using Linux,
Python and R. The student will have access to advanced
computational infrastructures, such as the high- per-
formance computing clusters available at Aberystwyth
University, and via Supercomputing Wales, and receive
appropriate training in their usage. The student will be
embedded within the extensive international collabora-
tive network of the supervisory team that includes plant
pathologists, genomics experts, modellers and practice-
oriented researchers, enabling the student to make use
of these diverse sets of expertise. A three-month place-
ment with Syngenta will provide the student with the
industry's perspective on the project's outcomes, ex-
panding the range of possible employment options after
the completion of the project. The unique combination
of empirical, mathematical and computational skills as
well as a valuable professional network developed in the
course of the project will increase the student's chances
to nd a high-prole job in academia, governmental
agencies or industry.

SexChromosomeEvolution
Graduate position: Sex chromosome evolution in a
viviparous reptile with genotypic and temperature-
dependent sex determination
Project theme:
Sex-determination controls the most signicant varia-
tion within animals- the division into males and females.
While the dierent systems of sex-determination involv-
ing genetic or environmental control are relatively well
understood, transitions between these systems remain
enigmatic in evolutionary biology. This project aims to
address this gap by revealing the molecular and cytoge-
netic changes required to transition between modes, us-
ing one of only two known lizard species exhibiting both
genetic and temperature control of sex. This knowledge
will have important implications for species conservation,
facilitating predictions of highly biased sex ratios under
climate change, plus potential commercial applications
for species where the production of one sex is favoured.
A PhD position is available to contribute to this research.
This student will conduct advanced cytogenetic research
on species of Australian lizards to help understand the
genomic changes accompanying transitions between ge-
netic and temperature-dependent sex determination.
This collaborative research project is funded by an
Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant
awarded to the University of Tasmania (Assoc Profs
Chris Burridge and Erik Wapstra) and the University of
Canberra (Prof Tariq Ezaz). This PhD project will be
based at the cytogenetics laboratory of Prof Tariq Ezaz
(University of Canberra). However, the successful PhD
candidate will spend signicant time at the University
of Tasmania to perform eldwork and some molecu-
lar genetic analysis. The Cytogenetic techniques to be
employed include C-banding, Comparative Genomic Hy-
bridisation (CGH), chromosome microdissection, uores-
cence in situ hybridisation (FISH), BAC library screen-
ing, and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Bioinfor-
matics such as comparative mapping will be also be
conducted.
The Ideal Candidate20 EvolDir February 1, 2021
The ideal candidate is expected to have knowledge in
molecular cytogenetics (e.g. cell culture, chromosome
preparation, FISH), and genomics (e.g. genomic data
mining, experience and familiarisation with sequence
analyses and NGS technology). Knowledge of chromo-
some biology and sex determination is also desirable.
The candidate will be self-motivated and well-organised,
with a demonstrated capacity to learn and apply the
broad skill set necessary for the successful completion
of a research project. The successful candidate will
be able to work alongside a wide variety of people in
multi-function and multicultural laboratories. The suc-
cessful candidate will also have a strong commitment to
excellence in research and scholarship.

BacterialEvolutionAndDiagnostics
PhD scholarship position at the Hawkesbury Institute
for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Aus-
tralia
Project title: Boosting diagnostics for plant production
industries: using Xanthomonas as a model organism for
increasing bacterial diagnostic capacity
Project description: Identifying sources of bacterial in-
fection of crop plants is essential to the maintenance
of a safe food supply and the protection of Australia's
food sources from exotic disease incursions. In recent
years, the use of genomics has revolutionised source
identication during outbreaks of pathogenic bacteria.
Comparison of bacterial genomes with phylogenetic ap-
proaches can provide high-quality evidence that two or
more infections from dierent locations are linked by
a common source, however, the analysis required for
this is time-consuming and not user-friendly. Further-
more, the incorporation of new data often requires a
complete reanalysis, which is highly undesirable in out-
break situations where samples are processed in small
batches over an extended time-period. An alternative to
phylogenetics is the use of dened multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) schemes based on thousands of gene
sequences identied from whole genomes. MLST-based
methods are rapid, comparable to phylogenetics in ac-
curacy, and importantly, allow the incorporation of new
data without complete reanalysis of the entire dataset.|
This project will construct genome-wide MLST schemes
for important bacterial pathogens of the genus Xan-
thomonas, which cause plant diseases that reduce the
quantity and quality of many fruit, vegetable, grain and
bre crops and are a signicant risk to agriculture in Aus-
tralia. The student will construct, validate and compare
these schemes to phylogenetic methods with real-world
datasets and work closely with molecular epidemiologists
and bacteriologists at the NSW Department of Primary
Industries to further analyse the genome sequences of
several signicant Xanthomonas species. The student
will aim to improve the understanding of Xanthomonas
strains and types, and correlate relationships identiedFebruary 1, 2021 EvolDir 21
by genome sequencing with classical epidemiological,
genotypical and phenotypical data.|
This project is part of a larger project funded through
the GRDC as part of the Rural R&D for prot program.
The results of this work will have real world implica-
tions for farmers, scientists and biosecurity and will
train a Higher Degree Research student at the forefront
of research relevant to plant health and biosecurity.|

NEONSamplePreparator
NEON Biorepository Sample Preparator
The School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University
is seeking a Sample Preparator (Research Technician) for
the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
Biorepository. NEON is expected to run for 30 years.
For each project year, the NEON Biorepository at ASU
will receive, process, store, and make available for re-
search an average of 100,000 samples from more than 80
sites across the United States. We will facilitate this by
creating a data portal to support discovery and tracking
of sample occurrences and sample data linkages, sample
transactions, and research use.
The NEON Sample Preparator will make critical con-
tributions to the project through a variety of curatorial
support and sample or specimen preparation and data
publication tasks; focused mainly but not exclusively
on mammal study skin and alcohol preparations and
specimen digitization ( ~85%); and herbarium voucher
preparations and digitization ( ~15%). If the position
is funded beyond the initial 6-month period, then posi-
tion contributions may shift to mammal study skin and
alcohol preparations and specimen digitization ( ~75%);
and herbarium voucher preparations and digitization
(~20%), and sorting, databasing and imaging of select
invertebrate samples ( ~5%). The position therefore re-
quires a relatively broad scope of research collection and
sample preparation and data publication skills. Critical
skills will revolve around preparing (small) mammal
skins, skulls, skeletons, tissues, organs, and other par-
tial samples, taking standard measurements, and other
procedures that will maximize the long-term suitability
of these NEON samples for varied research purposes.
Candidates who consider themselves well experienced or
highly motivated to acquire these skills and hence com-
plement the existing strengths of the NEON Bioreposi-tory team, are strongly encouraged to apply. An ability
to develop new data products to leverage the research po-
tential of NEON Biorepository samples with the greater
community is highly desired.

UAmsterdam EvolutionaryEcology
At the University of Amsterdam (UvA), at the Institute
for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED), we
have a new vacancy for a Tenure-track Assistant Profes-
sor in Evolutionary Ecology, specically host-microbe
interactions.
At IBED, we investigate how species relationships de-
termine the structure and stability of biological com-
munities, and how the integrity of these communities is
inuenced or compromised by processes such as species
extinction, the introduction of non-native invaders, and
the growth of harmful species. Within the department
of Evolutionary and Population Biology (EPB), our
research comprises fundamental and applied investiga-
tions at the level of individual variation, population
genetics and community dynamics, to understand the
process of speciation, the evolution of resistance, the
evolution of endangered and invasive species, and the
evolution in the face of climate change. Specically,
we are working on evolutionary questions related to
plant communities, plant-herbivore, herbivore-herbivore
and predator-herbivore interactions, both within and
between species.
Job responsibilities: Research We seek to appoint an
early-stage career tenure-track Assistant Professor, fo-
cusing on host-microbe or host-parasite interactions,
combining evolutionary theory with bioinformatic and
genomic analysis.
Our goal is to recruit someone who will develop com-
plementary research by contributing your skills and
expertise to our existing research program to achieve
common results.
Therefore, your research preferably links to existing
research systems that are already in place within
the Department of Evolutionary and Population Bi-
ology (EPB) (see https://ibed.uva.nl/content/research-departments/epb/epb.html), that ts within the re-
search focus of the Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosys-
tems Dynamics (IBED) and that can potentially con-
nect to the Research Priority Area Systems Biol-
ogy (see https://www.uva.nl/zwaartepunten/systems-
biology/systems-biology.html).
Teaching
The department is involved in the educational programs
of the BSc-programs (i) Biology and (ii) Future Planet
Studies, and the MSc-programs (i) Ecology and Evo-
lution and (ii) Future Planet Ecosystem Science. On
average, the IBED sta contributes 30-40% of their
time to education, including lecturing and supervising
of BSc- and MSc-students. Within IBED, we strive to
help and support early-career researchers to be(come)
successful, for which we have a mentoring system, and
the teaching load is lower in the rst 1-2 years of the
appointment. In addition, within the Faculty of Science,
newly appointed assistant professors follow a didactic
training trajectory, which upon completion results in
a University Teaching Qualication (Basis Kwalicatie
Onderwijs, BKO)) within two years.
In the course of the tenure track, we expect the assis-
tant professor to also organise course(s) and contribute
to courses in the eld of Evolutionary Ecology and de-
velop evolutionary ecology modules for MSc- and PhD-
students. We are especially interested in candidates who
can contribute to eldwork courses in the BSc-program
Biology.

DeadlineMar15
**ESEB Outreach Initiative Fund**
The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
welcomes applications to the ESEB Outreach Initiative
Fund for projects that promote evolution-related activ-
ities. The goal of this initiative is to improve public
knowledge about evolution globally.
Applications for funding will be accepted for educational
initiatives that promote evolution, translation of evolu-
tionary material (books, lms, and websites) intended
for a general audience, public outreach seminars, public
exhibitions, etc.There will be a single call per year with a total budget
of 20,000 Euro. A single project can be funded with up
to 4,000 Euro, but smaller projects are welcome. We
are requesting a report after one year, at which time
the project should be completed.
Please use the ESEB application form to submit your
proposal and note the word limits given herein. The
form can be downloaded at the ESEB website: https:/-
/eseb.org/prizes-funding/outreach-fund/ Proposals will
be accepted until *15th March 2021* and should be
submitted by email to the ESEB oce (Email: of-
ce@eseb.org; Subject: Outreach 2021). Note that we
will acknowledge receipt of all applications within a
week. If you have not received our conrmation by then,
please contact the ESEB oce again!
Please note that scientic meetings are not supported
by ESEB Outreach Initiative funds. These fund also do
not work as a mechanism for continual funding. Once
the potential of a project has been demonstrated, this
should be used as a basis to convince other funding
sources on continuation funds. Hence, submissions by a
group that has been successful in past calls may be pe-
nalized if the proposals are mere follow-ups of previous
projects.
The applications will be evaluated by the Outreach
Initiative Committee:

ESEB SpecialTopicNetworks Call
Mar31
***ESEB Special Topic Networks - Call for proposals***
Small symposia, workshops and courses in various for-
mats can perform functions complementary to those of
the ESEB Congresses, allowing more focused interac-
tions within specialist areas, forging new links between
previously separate areas or fostering interdisciplinary
and innovative ideas that merge specialized elds. One-
o events can be valuable but the returns for connected
series of events can be even greater. Therefore, ESEB in-
vites proposals for Special Topic Networks (STNs) that
will support dynamic and exible series of small meet-
ings and/or other networking opportunities in focusedFebruary 1, 2021 EvolDir 45
and currently active research areas.
Each STN will be funded for up to 6 years (subject to
review after 2 and 4 years of operation) with an annual
budget of up to 10,000 Euros. Four STNs have been
initiated since the start of the initiative (see https://-
eseb.org/prizes-funding/special-topic-networks/), and
further STNs will be initiated every other year. The
format of these STNs is up to their organisers and inno-
vative ideas are encouraged. All elds of evolutionary
biology are eligible. Applicants should provide a pro-
posal with the following components:
1) a description of the research area to be targeted,
showing why it is timely to address it in this way and
outlining the expected benets to the eld from the STN
(max. 1000 words), 2) a plan for the rst two years of
operation of the STN and an outline of activities over
the remaining years (max. 500 words), 3) the names and
aliations of the proposed organisers, with brief (max.
one page) CVs, and 4) a budget, with brief justication,
for the STN activities proposed for the rst two years.
Applicants should also identify an institution that is
prepared to open an account in which the funds can be
deposited and managed by the applicants. 'Overheads'
will not be paid to this institution but reasonable di-
rect administrative costs will be eligible. Funding for
each 2-year block will be subject to approval by the
STN Committee, established by Council, following re-
ceipt of a report of activities in the preceding 2 years.
The institution managing funds will be asked to pro-
vide a certied statement of expenditure to accompany
the report. The principal criterion for renewal will be
evidence that the funding provided had been used to
further interaction in the topic area.
Applications should be sent to the ESEB oce email
(oce@eseb.org) as PDF les by *** 31 March 2021***.
Updated versions of previously-submitted proposals are
welcome. Proposals will be assessed by an independent
STN Review Panel, appointed by the STN Committee
following the closing date and ensuring no conict of
interest by panel members. The STN Review Panel will
make funding recommendations to Council. The result
will be announced after the next Council meeting, at
latest on 31 August 2021.
The principal criterion for selection of an STN will be its
focus on an active area of research within the scope of
evolutionary biology. Preference might be given to STNs
that propose new connections between sub-disciplines
or that focus on the resolution of current controversies.
New STNs will address topicsdistinct from those covered
by currently-funded STNs. A score for this criterion
based on part (1) of the application will account for
50% of the overall panel score. It is primarily for theproposers to demonstrate the need for an STN, the po-
tential for it to stimulate progress and the activities
that will enable the network to be eective. A typi-
cal STN might organise one small discussion meeting
per year but it might also organise training events and
its members might work together to generate resources
or publications. Interaction among members might be
fostered, between meetings, using social media, online
discussion forums or similar. A score for the eective
and innovative nature of the plans laid out in part (2)
of the proposal will account for 25% of the overall panel
score. The nal 25% of the score will be based on the
budget and adherence to the following guidelines:
1. A proposal should be supported by at least three
ESEB members (membership in date on the closing
date for applications), from at least two and typically
three countries and taking gender issues into account,
who commit to organising the STN for its duration (or
to nding appropriate replacements if forced to step
down). A member should support no more than one
proposal in a given application round and organisers
of current STNs should not be proposers of new STNs.
2. STNs should organise at least one meeting in the
non-Congress year following its inception and one in its
nal non-Congress year. Complementing these meetings
with an innovative range of other activities is strongly
encouraged.

Fredric Janzen, Director Kellogg Biological Station

On behalf of leading members of the Organization for
Biological Field Stations...
Petition - Field Stations and Field Courses Imperiled All
basic requirements for life and civilization are inexorably
linked to natural resources and the wellbeing of our en-
vironment. As the human population skyrockets toward
8 billion and beyond, our impacts soar, leading us into
a multi-dimensional crisis. Much broader public un-
derstanding and engagement are necessary to overcome
these mounting challenges. More than ever, extensive
environmental data are urgently needed to guide local,
regional, and global policies toward functional solutions.
Fortunately, eld stations, strategically positioned
across the globe, have for generations amassed and ana-
lyzed crucial information about our planet - its climate,
endangered species, resource exploitation, environmen-
tal health, emergent diseases, and more - yielding many
long-term data sets integral to developing practical ap-
proaches to modern struggles. Research stations are
invaluable in situ hubs of exploration and discovery for
the training of students and early career scientists in the
fundamentals of diverse STEM disciplines. By aording
access to wildlife observation, they also inspire innu-
merable planetary stewards and promote responsible
ecotourism that, in turn, benets both nature and lo-
cal economies while spreading environmental awareness
among employees, neighbors, and visitors.
Unfortunately, current circumstances, especially
COVID-related travel restrictions, have truncated cash
ow to eld stations thereby debilitating their capacity
to generate essential data, conduct outreach activities,
and oer unique learning experiences. At a time when
environmental issues demand heightened attention, we
simply cannot risk undermining the continuum of sci-
entic endeavors and education. Field stations and the
courses they deliver are integral to scientic literacy and
remain critical to the protection of Earth' ^As natural
heritage and its life-sustaining ecosystem services.
We the undersigned hereby exhort governments, foun-
dations, and universities to commit to supporting sci-
entic research stations and their educational program-
ming throughout current pandemic adversities and sub-
sequently, to augment resources at a level commensurate
with their expanding importance to science and society.

Dear Colleagues,
We are looking for evolutionary biologists, ecologists,
and general biologists who are recent or soon-to-be PhD
graduates for a 6 month teaching fellowship.
At Science Corps, we are a small group of scientists
running a non-prot that sends recent PhD graduates
to improve life science education in under-resourced
areas. Science Corps oers fully paid fellowships to
upcoming and recent PhD graduates (up to four years
after graduation) to build science capacity at one of our
host locations. Fellows travel to partner institutions to
develop science curriculum, teach in secondary school
classrooms, train teachers, and build community-based
research projects.? We are currently seeking late stage
PhD student and postdoc applicants for our fellowships.
Should travel continue to be restricted, fellows will have
the opportunity to work remotely and then visit the
host site once it is safe to do so.We are presently interested in recruiting immediately for
fellowships starting within the next year. The deadline
for this application round is January 31st, but we still
encourage you to contact us if you would like to be
considered for a later appointment.
To nd out more about us, where our host sites are
located, and to apply, please go to https://science-
corps.org . Also, if you know of any institutions world-
wide that may share our goals, we would sincerely ap-
preciate it if you could point us their way.

CE3C Portugal PopulationGenomic-
sAndHybridization
Postdoc in population and speciation genomics
Dear Evolvir Community,
The Evolutionary Genetics group at CE3C, led by Vi-
tor Sousa, is looking for a postdoc in population and
speciation genomics, who is interested in developing
inference methods to study hybridization in natural
populations. The candidate will be part of a team work-
ing on the collaborative Human Frontiers in Science
Program (HFSP) project ???Chance or Curse? The con-
sequences of hybridization in a changing world??? (see
also the simultaneous postdoc opportunity in Claudia
Bank???s lab at https://banklab.github.io/positions/).
Once thought to be rare, we now know that hybridiza-
tion is quite common. There has been a longstanding
debate about the importance of hybridization because it
can have both benecial and harmful eects. By creat-
ing new phenotypes, hybridization can help organisms
adapt, but it can also drive extinction by generating
harmful combinations of genes. Past work has pro-
posed that in stressful environments, the benets of
hybridization may outweigh the costs, but this idea has
not been clearly tested. Understanding these dynam-
ics has become more pressing as rates of hybridization
have increased due to the stresses of rapidly changing
environments. As part of the funded HFSP grant in col-
laboration with Drs. Molly Schumer, Chelsea Rochman
and Claudia Bank, we will combine diverse and multi-
disciplinary expertise to tackle fundamental questions
via eld observations, laboratory experiments, compu-54 EvolDir February 1, 2021
tational tools, and mathematical models.
The research of the postdoc hired for this position will
aim at detecting regions of the genome involved in hybrid
incompatibilities, jointly inferring the demographic his-
tory of populations, disentangling the genetic signatures
of incompatibilities from other selective processes (e.g.
introgression load and adaptive introgression). This
will involve population genomics modeling, simulations,
method development and data analysis.
The ideal candidate has a strong background in statis-
tical and theoretical population genomics and a keen
interest in method development, modeling and coales-
cent theory. Individuals with a background in biology,
mathematics, statistics and related disciplines are en-
couraged to apply.
The research will be done at cE3c, FCUL in Lisbon. The
group of the PI works on population genomics and bioin-
formatics, and on its applications ranging from human
genetics to conservation and speciation. In addition to
independently developing this project, the candidate
is expected to contribute with his/her expertise to the
group, interacting with the other team members and
co-mentoring junior lab members.
We provide a dynamic and interdisciplinary work
environment within the research group (https://-
ce3c.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/team/EG), and within the col-
laborator team (Claudia Bank, University of Bern
https://banklab.github.io/; Molly Schumer, Stanford
University, https://schumerlab.com/; Chelsea Rochman,
University of Toronto, https://rochmanlab.com/).
If desired by the candidate, short or mid-term visits
of the collaborator labs are encouraged, and the candi-
date is expected to present and discuss their work at
international workshops and conferences.
The salary will be commensurate with qualications and
experience, according to the host institution statutes (ap-
proximately ranging from 32,000-36,000 EUR gross per
year, including social security and pension funds). Fund-
ing for this position is currently available for 12months
renewable up to 3 years.
Contact and Application
If interested, please prepare a detailed CV, a motivation
letter explaining the t for the position and the desired
starting date, and contacts of up to 3 referees. You
will need to submit your application online (http://-
concursos.fciencias-id.pt). Details about the position
and the required documtnts can be found here: http:/-

Evaluation of the applications will begin on 18 January2020 and continue until the position is lled, with a
desired starting date as early as possible. Following
the policy of the host institution, it is expected that
the candidate relocates to Portugal in time for the
starting date of the position. Please contact me if you
are interested and have questions (vmsousa@fc.ul.pt).

Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Sci-
ence and Technology, is an internationally net- worked
aquatic research institute within the ETH Domain
(Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology). Eawag con-
ducts research, education and expert consulting to
achieve the dual goals of meeting direct human needs
for water and maintaining the function and integrity of
aquatic ecosystems.
The Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution (FishEc)
located in Kastanienbaum (Lucerne) has a vacancy for
a Postdoctoral Fellow in Genomics of Rapid Adaptation
The notion that evolution can be rapid, when adaptive
changes and changes in population size occur at the same
time scale, raises questions regarding the genetic basis of
adaptive traits and the need to understand the temporal
dynamics of adaptive evolution, i.e., how frequent adap-
tive changes are and what inuences the rate of change.
Experiments with chemostat systems showed that host
(Chlorella green algae) and virus rapidly evolved re-
sistance and counter adaptation. The entanglement
of the coevolutionary and population size dynamics
(eco-evolutionary dynamics) makes this a fascinating
study system of rapid evolution. The experiments are
replicated and tness of the populations and individual
clones at dierent time can be assessed (see Retel etal. 2019; DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aax0530). The postdoc
project advertised here is aiming to study the underly-
ing genomic changes evolving during experimental host
virus coevolution. A goal will be to dierentiate be-
tween neutral and adaptive changes and characterizing
the dynamics of those changes across the time course of
the experiments. This will require the development of
innovative analysis methods, which make full use of the
replicated and innovative experimental setup aiming to
disentangle the eect of selection and demography.
The successful candidate will have substantial opportuni-
ties to develop his or her own research skills and to assist
in the supervision of Bachelors, and Master students.
The work will consist of the analysis of next generation
whole genome data, the development of bioinformatics
pipelines and tools, and the interpretation and publica-
tion of the results. This study will be carried out in a
close collaboration between the Fish Genomics group at
Eawag Kastanienbaum and Lutz Becks and the group of
Aquatic Ecology and Evolution at the University of Kon-
stanz. Applications are sought from individuals with a
profound interest in Bioinformatics and Evolutionary
Genomics. Applicants should have earned a PhD in a
relevant eld of evolutionary biology, or bioinformatics.
Excellent communication skills in English and skills in
team work are essential. The duration of the position
will be one years, nanced by the Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation. We are dedicated to the continue
this collaboration and eager to explore opportunities for
funding also together with the applicant.
We are a research department of Eawag (Department
of Fish Ecology and Evolution) and a division (Aquatic
Ecology) of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution of
the University of Bern, and the successful candidate will
have a unique possibility to take advantage of both these
excellent academic environments. The work place is at
Eawag' ^As Center for Ecology, Evolution and Biogeo-
chemistry in Kastanienbaum, Lucerne, which besides the

ping the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and envi-
ronmental samples", led by Professor Vincent Savolainen
and in collaboration with several groups at Imperial Col-
lege (Ransome, Bell, Woodward, Jones).
Mapping the prevalence of COVID-19 cases is essential
for designing and tracking the ecacy of control poli-
cies, such as social distancing and isolation. Community-
level estimates of disease prevalence should be sucient
to develop these mitigation strategies - especially when
the disease is widespread and infection is driven by com-
munity transmission. Given that there is now good
evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in faeces
for prolonged periods (even for otherwise asymptomatic
individuals), it may be possible to map the prevalence
of COVID-19 using sewage samples. You will be part
of a multidisciplinary team of ecologists, virologists and
modellers, who are testing sewage, connected freshwa-
ter bodies and wildlife for SARS-CoV-2 and related
coronaviruses across the UK.
Your main role will be to help characterise new coro-
naviruses in bats by assembling sequence reads from
next generation sequencing (e.g. Illumina read from
RNA extractions of faecal samples). The potential for
sewage outows in the environment to contribute to
transmission to humans and wildlife will also be investi-
gated by assessing viral infectivity from environmental
samples. You will help to run coronavirus infectivity
assays, alongside our technician, in our dedicated con-
tainment level 3 (CL3) laboratory at Imperial College.
You will also help coordinate the collection and delivery
of sewage and environmental samples from across the
UK.
Duties and responsibilities
Your main role will be to assemble sequence reads from
next generation sequencing data (e.g. Illumina read
from RNA extractions of faecal samples) and to char-
acterise coronaviruses from bats, other wildlife and/or
other environmental samples.
The potential for sewage outows in the environment to
contribute to transmission to humans and wildlife will
also be investigated by assessing viral infectivity from
environmental samples. You will help to run coronavirus
infectivity assays in our dedicated CL3.

one of the UK's most prestigious universities.
Undertaking research in a vibrant, inter-disciplinary
research environment with an excellent international
reputation, you will work as a key member of a research
team investigating the function and evolution of plant
genomes and transposable elements (TEs).
TEs represent the majority of eukaryotic DNA, for ex-
ample they occupy 55% of the human genome and up
to 80-90% of the genomes of some plants. Our lab is in-
terested in understanding the interactions between TEs
and their host genomes by focusing both on mechanistic
and evolutionary perspectives.
We are seeking for a skilled molecular biologist to in-
vestigate the interplay between the 3D genome and
transposable elements. In particular, we are aiming to
elucidate the role of chromosome topology in guiding
TE integration patterns. For our studies, we will use
the plant model species A. thaliana. You will perform
TE activation assays, identify TE integration sites by
deep sequencing and analyse epigenetic modications.
The aim of the project is to combine analyses of TE,
epigenetic and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)
data to characterize the epigenetic and 3D structure of
the host cells where the new TE copies have inserted.
To this end, the project includes collaborations with
colleagues in UK (Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Nuetzmann, Dr.
Davide Michieletto) and US (Prof. Keith Slotkin).February 1, 2021 EvolDir 67
This is an excellent opportunity for a molecular biologist
wishing to apply their skills to an innovative area of
science. Through the collaborations, you will have the
opportunity to further acquire new skill sets, for exam-
ple in Hi-C technologies. The position is supported by a
grant of the Royal Society and is associated with gener-
ous research funds. We aim for funding to be available
after the completion of the Royal Society support.
The position is primarily lab-based. You should have
a PhD in Molecular Biology/Genetics, excellent molec-
ular biology skills and be interested to work at the
cutting-edge of plant genetics/epigenetics. Please con-

PlantEvolutionaryBiochemistry
Evolutionary biochemistry of plant hydrocarbon biosyn-
thesis ??? 65% Scientist position (3 years) at post-doc
or PhD student level
We seek a highly motivated person as a PhD student or
post-doc with a keen interest in evolutionary biochem-
istry in the context of plant hydrocarbon (especially
alkene) biosynthesis. The successful candidate will be
part of an international team investigating the ecologi-
cal, molecular and genomic basis of pollinator-mediated
reproductive isolation and ecological speciation between
sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys.
The project seeks to biochemically characterise key genes
and proteins underlying the biosynthesis of pollinator-
relevant hydrocarbon-based oral odour. In particular,
it will aim to characterise the substrate specicities of
very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthetic en-
zymes such as ??-ketoacyl-CoA synthases (KCSs) and
aldehyde decarbonylases (CER1/CER3 homologues) in
a nonmodel plant, using heterologous expression in other
organisms (e.g. yeast or other plants), purication and
in vitro activity assays as well as analysis via GC/MS.
Results will be incorporated in an evolutionary analysis
of protein function. For background information on the
study system, please see e.g. Schl??ter & Schiestl (2008,
Trends Plant Sci.), Schl??ter & al. (2011, PNAS) and
Sedeek & al. (2013, PLoS One; 2016, Curr. Biol.).
In addition to research, this position will also involve
teaching basic plant science/botany at undergraduate
level. While the working environment is primarily
English-speaking, German will be required in the con-
text of teaching. The ideal candidate should be highly
motivated and able to articulate her/his motivation for
this project clearly in the cover letter. S/he should
be intellectually rigorous, well organised, scientically
independent and resilient, with a thorough understand-
ing of plant biochemistry (especially VLCFA synthesis),
plant molecular and evolutionary biology. The candi-
date is expected to be procient and independent in the
molecular lab, with experience in recombinant protein
expression, protein biochemistry and GC/MS analysis.
Ideally, also with some experience with HPLC and data
analysis in R, genomic techniques and phylogeny.
Prociency in English and good communication skillsare essential and the proven ability to carry out research
independently. German skills and the willingness to
gain prociency and uency in German are also highly
desirable. Academically, this position requires either
(a) a completed MSc degree (or equivalent) in biology,
biochemistry, molecular biology or a related discipline,
allowing the enrolment as a PhD student, or (b) a PhD
degree to work as a post-doc. If applying at post-doc
level, experience in student/TA supervision is expected
as well as the (willingness to gain) experience in writing
grant applications.
We oer a 3-year position as a post-doc or PhD student
at the University of Hohenheim, Germany (initial salary
level 65% TVL-E13 commensurate to experience), an
innovative and international research university in the

tion (1-2 pages), your CV and publication list, and the
names and e-mail adresses of three academic referees.
The letter of motivation should detail why you are per-
sonally interested in the project, why you nd it relevant
and why you think you are well-suited to undertake it.

a postdoctoral scientist position in avian evolutionary
genomics.
We conduct research on diverse topics related to avian
evolution and evolutionary ecology. For this position,
we are interested in a candidate with experience in the
collection and analysis of genomic data and expertise
in areas such as any of the following: genome evolution,
population genetics and historical demography, land-
scape and spatial genetics, introgression and gene ow,
and/or gene expression. The position involves oppor-
tunities to advance ongoing collaborative projects, as
well as to develop new projects that leverage our cur-
rent datasets and ongoing data collection. The specic
focus of the project will depend somewhat on the ex-
perience and interests of the applicant, but will involve
the relationship between life history (especially seasonal
migration) and evolutionary processes such as gene ow,
population dierentiation, range expansion and molec-
ular evolution. We are mainly using North American
birds as a study system, but the research may involve
other systems as well.
Critical to the success of the position will be the abilityand desire to work both independently and collabora-
tively with other members of the lab. Duties may involve
project coordination and development, analysis of ge-
nomic data and bioinformatics, wet lab work (including
preparation of genomic libraries), training of gradu-
ate and undergraduate students, and dissemination of

UVirginia CoevolutionaryGenetics
The Department of Biology at the University of Virginia
invites applicants for a post-doctoral Research Associate
position in the lab of Professor Amanda Gibson as part
of a 5-year NIH-funded project.
The big questions we're pursuing with this project are:
* How do organisms adapt to rampant uncertainty? *
In what ways does context, both environmental and
genetic, change the alleles that matter for tness? * To
what extent do these genetic interactions confound our
ability to map genotype to phenotype? (and can we
overcome this?)
We use resistance to parasites as a model trait to get
at these questions. The work will make use of the ex-
perimental tools and resources available for the model
nematode C. elegans and its natural parasites, including
experimental evolution, cryogenic preservation, high-
throughput phenotyping, transgenic methods, wild iso-
lates with whole genome sequences, and public resources
for genetic mapping. You can nd read more about the
position and the lab at https://coevolving.org/join-us/
https://coevolving.org/join-us/ REQUIRED QUALI-
FICATIONS:
* A PhD in Biology or a related eld by the start date
* Excellent written and oral communication, demon-
strated by a strong publication record, consistent with
the candidate's career stage, and presentations at con-
ferences * Demonstrated ambition, creativity, indepen-
dence, and ability to work well with others * A strong
background in experimental design, data analysis, and
data management * Interest and condence in develop-
ing new techniques for hypothesis testing * Experiencein mentoring undergraduate students and a dedication
to promoting underrepresented groups in STEM
PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:
* Demonstrated strengths in evolutionary genetics, host-
parasite coevolution or closely allied elds * Experience
with analysis and interpretation of genomic data and
design of mapping studies

CRISPR associated (Cas) genes in archaea. CRISPR-
Cas is the adaptive immune system of bacteria and
archaea and, in addition, some cas genes occur outside
of CRISPR-Cas loci, where they are potentially involved
in functions beyond defense. For example, casposons
are mobile genetic elements encoding Cas1. We are
interested in detecting such non-canonical cas genes in
archaea, predicting their function, and studying their
evolution. We oer the opportunity to develop the focus
of the project with respect to own research interests.

ary biologists model and understand the relationships
between speciation, extinction, molecular evolution, bio-
geography, and time-varying geographical barriers. The
postdoc will have opportunities to mentor graduate and
undergraduate researchers, to teach at computational
biogeography workshops, publish rst-author articles,
and present at major conferences.
The postdoctoral research will interact regularly with
other project team members, including Dr. Felipe Za-
pata (University of California, Los Angeles), Dr. Nina
Rnsted (National Tropical Botanical Garden, Hawaii),
Dr. Warren Wagner (Smithsonian Natural History Mu-
seum), Dr. Bruce Baldwin (UC Berkeley), and Dr. Will

Course Overview:
The course will describe dierent aspects and methods
in the eld of functional ecology, combining theoretical
lessons with hands-on real data. Lectures will provide
the theoretical and mathematical basis for dierent ap-80 EvolDir February 1, 2021
plications of functional traits at organismal, community
and ecosystem levels, with examples across dierent
trophic levels. This will serve as a basis for exploring
the practical tools to connect the eect of land-use and
climate change on biodiversity to the eect of biodiver-
sity on to multiple ecosystem functions and ecological
services. An overview of existing computational meth-
ods, including recent developments authored by the
lecturers, will be provided during the course and the
students will learn how to apply them using functions
and scripts run in R. Students are welcome to apply
these tools to their own data, or use the data provided,
to be analysed during the course while beneting from
advise by the lecturers. As such, compared to other
courses given by the lectures, this is a slightly a more
advanced and data oriented course which concentrates
on detailed and practical aspects in functional traits
related applications, especially computational ones. The
aim of the course is to provide participants with a handy
synthesis of existing concepts, tools and trends in func-
tional ecology and guide them to apply these tools to
their own eld of interest. As the eld of functional
ecology is rapidly expanding, participants will be ready
to exploit the potential of the main trait approaches.

globally diverse environments. In September 2020, we
were awarded funding from the National Science Founda-
tion to design a Biology Integration Institute (BII) with
the intent of submitting a proposal in January 2022.To
broaden our network and facilitate new collaborations
and transformative research, we are soliciting potential
collaborators for a workshop to design a Biology Inte-
gration Institute focused on the theme of Terrestrial
Responses to Emerging Environments through Time,
Integrated from Moments to Eons (TREETIME).
Workshop participants will take part in periodic asyn-
chronous activities this spring to rene the theme of the
proposed BII, culminating in a 2-day workshop on May
18th (Tuesday) and 19th (Wednesday) in which we will
build team cohesion, nalize the scope of the BII, and
develop research projects and hypotheses. Further infor-
mation and details regarding the workshop and design
of the BII at the The Morton Arboretum are available
on the attached document as well as here. Additionally,
on January 19, 1:00-2:00 PM (Central Time), we will be
holding a live, virtual Q&A session that you can join to
learn additional information (details forthcoming). You
may register for the event here. You may also reach out
to any of us (contact information included below) for
further information.
As an independent, nonprot organization, The Morton
Arboretum has a responsibility to serve the public good.February 1, 2021 EvolDir 81
This responsibility is best informed by including diverse
perspectives at all levels, including the design, execution,
and application of our scientic research. Interested col-
laborators must share this commitment and positively
contribute to advancing inclusion, diversity, equity, and
accessibility.

ern geometric morphometrics, including: acquiring data,
analysing it, visualizing and interpreting the results.
This course is aimed at beginners and intermediate users.
In other words, it is aimed at researchers who intend
to use geometric morphometrics or who have started
performing geometric morphometric analyses but feel
they need a more structured background.

Online RADSeq Feb8-11
The University of Connecticut's Computational Biology
Core is oering a workshop on assaying genetic varia-
tion using restriction site associated DNA sequencing,
or RAD-Seq.
The workshop will cover basic concepts and walk
through a complete analysis on a high performance
computing cluster. The analysis will start with raw
reads and go through some very basic analyses of pop-
ulation genetic structure. The core learning goal is to
familiarize attendees with the steps necessary to ana-
lyze RAD-seq data, the tools available, common data
formats, and possible pitfalls they may encounter.
We'll analyze several hundred samples collected for a
landscape genetic study of arctic grayling, a freshwater
sh, using the ddRAD method (Peterson et al. 2012).
All code required to complete the full analysis will be
provided in a public github repository. Session record-
ings will be made available to all participants in the
afternoon after each session and will be accessible for
several months following the workshop.
The workshop will take place over 4 days for three hours
each day.84 EvolDir February 1, 2021
Dates: February 8-11 (4 days)
Time: Feb8: 8:30am - 12pm, Feb9-11: 9.00am - 12.00pm
Location: Online
Cost: $300
Workshop schedule:
Day 1: Introduction to Linux/HPC
Day 2: Introduction to RADSeq, high throughput se-
quencing data, quality control, read mapping
Day 3: Reference-based and de novo variant discovery
approaches.
Day 4: Manipulating, ltering, reformatting output les.
Basic population genomic analyses.

Online UnixForBioinform Apr26-30
Dear all,
applications are now open for our course \Unix and shell
scripting for bioinformatics", which will be delivered
remotely on April, 26th-30th.
Course website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/unix/ In this course, students will
be introduced to the most powerful Unix commands
and they will learn how to connect to external re-
sources/servers, install specialist tools and ultimately
to combine commands into scripts for automation and
reproducibility. Hands-on sessions will focus on ap-
plying those tools to process biological data, explicitly
next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.
This course assumes no prior knowledge of Unix and
shell scripting. Since most examples will be focused on
biological data, some background in biology is desired.
Learning outcomes:
1) Mastering most popular Unix commands 2) Creating
and editing les using the command line 3) Processing
large les using Unix and bash scripting 4) Automat-
ing bioinformatics pipelines by writing shell scripts 5)
Managing system tasks and resources usage

ence workshop, May 3-May 6, 2021. The workshop isaimed at encouraging talented scientists and mathemati-
cians with a demonstrated commitment to diversity to
consider academia as a career.
This year the workshop will be virtual but there will be
many opportunities to interact with faculty and other
participants and have your questions answered!
Participants will develop strategies to prepare them to
pursue academic careers. The workshop is targeted
at scholars ready to take the next step^ a euro \post-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.86 EvolDir February 1, 2021
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
