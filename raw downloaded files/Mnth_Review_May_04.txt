Denmark SocialInsectEvol Sep2-6
Dear All,
The closing symposium of the EU-funded research
training network INSECTS (INtegrated Studies of the
EConomy of InsecT Societies) will be held in Helsing,
Denmark, 2-6 September 2004.
This meeting is open to EVERYONE who is inter-
ested in social insects or the evolution of social systems,
whether a not they are a member of the INSECTS net-
work (This point was perhaps not emphasized enough
when the symposium was announced), and we hope to
make it a key event for social insect research, partic-
ularly in Europe, as well as emphasizing the parallels
between social insects and other social systems.
The scientiﬁc program will include approximately 50
talk slots (20 minutes each), the vast majority of which
are open to all participants. In addition there will be
plenary talks by INSECTS group leaders (Johan Billen,
Koos Boomsma, J¨ urgen Heinze, Graeme Jones, Laurent
Keller, Pekka Pamilo, Francis Ratnieks, Paul Schmid-
Hempel, Lotta Sundstr¨ om and Stefano Turillazzi) and
invited speakers from outside the network (Those con-
ﬁrmed so far are Eric Bonabeau and Stuart West).
Registration for the meeting opened on the 1 April
2004, and is via the symposium web site:
http://www.zi.ku.dk/eunet/helsingor/index.html The
closing date for abstract submission is 1 June 2004, and
the ﬁnal deadline for registration is 25 June 2004.
The cost of the meeting is DKK 4400 per person, which
covers all costs including registration, conference ma-
terials, accommodation, all food for the meeting, the
symposium banquet and a half-day excursion to the
royal castles of Frederiksborg and Fredensborg.
For more details, and to register, please see the sympo-
sium web site:

CALL FOR SYMPOSIA for the 10th Congress of the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology, Krakow,
Poland, 2005
According to our tradition the biennial congress of the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology will be held
in 2005. I am pleased to announce that the tenth ESEBMay 1, 2004 EvolDir 5
Congress will be held in Krakow, Poland, from 15-20
August 2005. The Program starts on Tuesday morning
with arrivals planned for Monday, 15 August, allowing
participants to take advantage of less expensive airfares.
The location is in vicinity of Krakow’s old city.
The structure of the Congress will be similar to previ-
ous meetings, each day starting with a plenary keynote
speaker, followed by parallel symposia. The congress
will cover the ﬁeld of evolutionary biology in a wide
sense but with emphasis on processes and mechanisms
of evolutionary phenomena.
There is room for about 25 regular symposia. Everyone
is invited to submit a symposium proposal (deadline
July 31, 2004). Successful Symposia will be selected by
the Congress Executive. A few open sessions may also
be organized.
TOPICS. A symposium should cover a well deﬁned
topic in the ﬁeld of evolutionary biology. It can deal
with; population biology, genetics, palaeontology, be-
havioural ecology, sexual selection or any other ﬁeld
that aims at understanding processes and mechanisms
of evolution. We are looking for areas in which there
is exciting current activity or novel synthesis, or young
ﬁelds that are likely to grow in the near future.
SET-UP. Symposia will be strictly modular with three
invited speakers and 10 contributed papers (full day
symposia) or 5 contributed papers (half day symposia).
Time for an invited speaker will be 30 minutes, and 20
minutes for a contributed paper. No exceptions will be
allowed.
BUDGET. The budget for a symposium organizer will
be limited. ESEB will waive the registration fees for
the 3 invited speakers. However, ESEB is unable to
cover all costs (travel, accommodation etc.) of invited
speakers, implying that you should seek solutions for
remaining ﬁnancial problems yourself.
TIME SCHEDULE By July 31, 2004: Submission
of symposium proposals. All submissions should be
made by website http://www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb/ and
enquiries to eseb2005@eko.uj.edu.pl with “symposium”
written as a subject.

further information on the website.
SUBMITTING A SYMPOSIUM PROPOSAL.
SYMPOSIUM ORGANISERS. There should be one or-
ganiser for each symposium, and one co-organiser who
will stand in for the former if required.
PROPOSALS CONTENTS The proposal should not
exceed one A4 page and should contain:
1. Organisers name and address (mail, telephone, fax
and email), a four-line description of your research in-
terest, and the references of two recent publications.
2. Co-organisers name and address (mail, telephone,
fax and email), a four-line description of your research
interest, and the references of two recent publications.
Please distinguish clearly between the organiser and the
co-organiser.
3. A short (6 line) description of the symposium topic.
4. Suggestions for 3 invited speakers with their ad-
dresses and expertise. At this stage there is no need to
have a commitment from these speakers, but it is sug-
gested to negotiate with invited speakers before sending
out the submission.
SUBMISSION Deadline for submission is JULY
31, 2004 Proposals should be submitted through
www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb/ . PROCEDURE You will re-
ceive a conﬁrmation of your submission. All proposals
will be assessed and the ﬁnal selection made in Septem-
ber 2004. Criteria for acceptance will be:
1. The topic itself should be such that a symposium at
ESEB 2005 is justiﬁed, i.e., it falls within the Society’s
remit. Beyond this, we are looking for areas in which
there is exciting current activity or novel synthesis, or
young ﬁelds that are likely to grow in the near future.
2. When two proposals have a similar topic, we will
either choose one or bring organizers into contact with
each other.

Symposium: Genome Evolution in Microbial Eukary-
otes June 3rd, Smithﬁeld Rhode Island
To elucidate principles of eukaryotic genome evolution,
we must increase studies of microbial eukaryotes. The
bulk of eukaryotic diversity is microbial yet our cur-
rent knowledge of eukaryotic genome evolution comes
largely from studies of plants, animals and fungi. Our
intention in this one-day symposium is to highlight re-
cent achievements in understanding the diversity of eu-
karyotic genomes, and to expose relevant researchers to
advances in techniques for both data acquisition and
data analysis.

Travel funds are available for undergraduates, graduate
students and postdocs. Deadline for requests is May 1.
These funds will oﬀset costs of those currently working
on molecular evolution/genomics of microbial eukary-
otes, and those switching into the ﬁeld. Students and
postdocs are encouraged to bring a poster of their work.

RoscoﬀFrance HostParasite Sep4-8
Jacques Monod Conference: “Evolutionary ecology of
host-parasite relationships”
Roscoﬀ (Brittany), France - September 4-8, 2004
The last quarter of the 20th century witnessed an in-
crease in the interest of evolutionary biologists in under-
standing and controlling infectious diseases. There is
growing awareness that neither “hosts” nor “parasites”
are static entities, that their populations are composed
of a variety of interacting and competing genotypes,
and that this genetic variation is not only important
for natural populations, but also for agriculture and
human medicine. Understanding host and parasite evo-
lution and coevolution is particularly important at a
time when new diseases aﬀecting humans or animals are
emerging around the world, while old, well-understood
diseases like tuberculosis are acquiring broad resistance
to traditional drugs.
The goal of this conference is to stress innovative re-
searches in the ﬁeld of evolutionary ecology and epi-
demiology of infectious diseases. Debates will focus on
the diﬀerent ways parasites exploit their hosts; on the
epidemiology and population genetics of parasitic infec-
tions; on the evolution of virulence, resistance and host
immunity. In all cases, we will try to bridge the gap
between theory and empirical works.
The total number of participants is limited to about
100 and all participants are expected to attend for the
whole duration of the conference. Selection is made on
the basis of the aﬃnity of potential participants with
the topics of the conference. Scientists and PhD Stu-
dents interested in the meeting should send:
* their curriculum vitae * the list of their main publi-
cations for the 3 last years * the abstract of their pre-
sentation
to the Thierry Rigaud (chairman) of the conference be-
fore the deadline.
Registration fee, including board and lodging 360 Euros
for PhD Students 500 Euros for other participants
Deadline for application: 15 May 2004.

SYMPOSIUM IN HONOR OF GEORGE C.
WILLIAMS
A symposium will be held on April 24, 2004 on the
Stony Brook University campus to celebrate George
Williams’ contributions to Ecology and Evolution -
the department and the disciplines. George came to
Stony Brook in 1960 even before it existed as such,
and his accomplishments were instrumental in building
our department. He was elected to the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences in 1993 and shared the Crafoord
Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences with
Ernst Mayr, and John Maynard Smith in 1999 for his
contributions to evolutionary biology.
Registration for the symposium begins at 8:30 am on
April 24 and the talks will run from 9:15 am until 5:00
pm.
George has assembled a group of distinguished speakers
for the symposium:
MARY JANE WEST-EBERHARD - What George
Williams said about sex but didn’t really believe.
DAVID HAIG - Reﬂections on pregnancy and Dar-
winian medicine. RANDOLPH NESSE - Maladapta-
tion and natural selection. BOBBI LOW - Women’s
lives in evolutionary perspective. HELENA CRONIN
- Adaptation. GEORGE BARLOW How to de-
cide that a species is sex-role reversed? MARTIN
DALY and MARGO WILSON - Facultative modula-
tion of risk-taking and future discounting in Homo sapi-8 EvolDir May 1, 2004
ens. STEVEN FERRARO - Red-letter days. MART
GROSS - Sex ratio theory.

UAlaskaFairbanks SSB 2005
Call for Proposals for 2005 SSB Symposia. - The Soci-
ety for Systematic Biologists invites proposals for sym-
posia at the 2005 SSB meetings to be held at the Uni-
versity of Alaska, Fairbanks. The meetings will be held
jointly with the American Society of Naturalists and
the Society for the Study of Evolution. Each proposal
should include (1) a descriptive title, (2) one or two
paragraphs explaining the purpose of the symposium
and its relevance to systematics, (3) a list of presen-
tations including proposed speakers, their institutions
or aﬃliations, and their presentation titles, (4) an in-
dication of whether the speakers have been invited and
whether they have agreed to participate, and (5) the
proposed length of each talk. Symposia are restricted to
half-day sessions. The society is particularly interested
in symposia whose topics do not overlap with thoseMay 1, 2004 EvolDir 9
from previous meetings, that introduce new ideas or
synthesize important concepts, or those that are partic-
ularly good examples of the analysis of empirical data.
Proposals that unite systematics with other ﬁelds are
also desirable. We encourage participation from young
investigators and others typically under-represented in
symposia. Limited partial funding is available. The
target date for receipt of proposals is May 1, 2004. Pro-
posals will be discussed and two will be selected at the
SSB Council meeting during the 2004 annual meeting
in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Soon after, organizers will
be notiﬁed of the status of their proposals. Propos-
als should be sent by email to the Program Director,
Kevin P. Johnson, at: kjohnson@inhs.uiuc.edu (Kevin
P. Johnson, Illinois Natural History Survey, 607 East
Peabody Drive, Champaign, Illinois 61820).

Valencia MEEGID Jul19-23
05/04/04
The 7th International Meeting “Molecular Epidemi-
ology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Dis-
eases” (MEEGID VII) will be held in Valencia ( http:/-
/www.valencia-on-line.com/ ), Spain, 19th-23rd July
2004. As for the 6 ﬁrst MEEGID meetings, it will be co-
organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/ ) in Atlanta and
the Institut de Recherche pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD;
http://www.ird.fr/ ) in France.
MEEGID VII will be hosted by the 9th European
Multicolloquium of Parasitology (EMOP IX; http://-
www.uv.es/emop9/ ). Many sessions will be organized
in common by the 2 meetings. EMOP IX is expected to
attract 2000-4000 participants. Communications done
in the framework of MEEGID VII will therefore have
much impact. EMOP IX is organized by Professor San-
tiago Mas Coma, professor of parasitology at the uni-
versity of Valencia, receiving editor of Infection, Genet-
ics and Evolution (Elsevier) for Spain, and co-organizer
of MEEGID VII (S.Mas.Coma@uv.es)
Preliminary programme is communicated below. Manyslots are still available. Proposals are therefore still ac-
cepted and welcome for: (1) Posters; (2) Oral commu-
nications; (3) Organizations of roundtables/symposia
(2 hours, 4-6 speakers); (4) Express debates (1 hour,
only one speaker with a communication of 15-20 mn fol-
lowed by free discussion); (4) Plenary lectures (45 mn).
Proposals dealing with roundtables/symposia, express
debates and plenary lectures should be submitted as
soon as possible.
MEEGID is not restricted to evolution only. The
scopes proposed can deal with genetics, genomics, pro-
teomics, population biology, mathematical modelling,
bioinformatics, molecular epidemiology, molecular di-
agnosis and morphometrical identiﬁcation. They can
consider the host, the pathogen or the vector. Papers
considering host + pathogen or pathogen + vector (co-
evolution) are particularly encouraged. All pathogens
are within the scope of MEEGID: viruses, parasitic
protozoa, helminths, fungal organisms, prion. All in-
fectious models can be considered, including those of
veterinary or agronomical relevance. As for the for-
mer MEEGID congresses, special consideration will be
given to communications of high relevance for develop-
ing countries.
The papers communicated for MEEGID VII will be
published in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and
Evolution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002). Infection, Genetics and Evolution is now covered
by Medline and Index Medicus, since the 1st issue of the
journal.
Awards will be attributed to the best communication,
the best communication by a student and the best com-
munication by a scientist from the Southern World on
a problem speciﬁcally relevant to these areas.
Limited funds will be made available to travel students
and scientists from developing countries.
See you in Valencia!

NERC funded PhD studentship (available to UK resi-
dents only)
Speciation in marine ﬁshes: a population genetic as-
sessment of hamlets.
The main aim of this project is to investigate the mech-anisms of speciation in hamlets, the most famous exam-
ple of a marine radiation, using population genetic anal-
yses. Nine to 12 species (colour morphs) of these small,
carnivorous ﬁsh are distributed across the Caribbean.
Many morphs co-occur on reefs and all are identical ex-
cept in colour pattern. Hamlet morphs will be sampled
at 10 localities across the Caribbean and individuals
will be screened with a battery of AFLP primer combi-
nations to generate multi-locus genotypes for individual
ﬁsh. These AFLP proﬁles will be used to investigate the
phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships amongMay 1, 2004 EvolDir 11
and within colour morphs and to investigate gene ﬂow
between morphs in sympatry.
This NERC funded project is supervised by Drs
Brent Emerson (b.emerson@uea.ac.uk) and Isabelle
Cˆ ot´ e (i.cote@uea.ac.uk) at the Centre for Ecology, Evo-
lution and Conservation, School of Biological Sciences,
University of East Anglia. The start date is 1 October
2004, and applications will be accepted until the po-
sition is ﬁlled. For further information, contact Brent

Dear Colleague,
Please pass this announcement on to all potentially
interested candidates. We have two PhD-positions
available in Behavioural Ecology at the University of
Bern. The job description is attached also as a Word-
ﬁle for advertisement on your notice board. If you
have any questions, please contact me per e- mail
(michael.taborsky@esh.unibe.ch).
Sorry for cross-posting
———- TWO PhD- POSITIONS in BEHAVIOURAL
ECOLOGY are available at the Department of Be-
havioural Ecology of the Zoological Institute, Univer-
sity of Bern, Switzerland. One project will focus on
the mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviour in a
highly social Lake Tanganyika cichlid. In particular we
are interested in the inﬂuence of ecology and social re-
lationships on the propensity to cooperate. This study
will involve experimental manipulation of habitat, so-
cial conditions and behaviour, both in the lab and ﬁeld.
The second project will focus on the ecology and evo-
lution of sperm competition and alternative reproduc-
tive tactics when fertilization is external. A Lake Tan-
ganyika cichlid breeding in empty snail shells will beused as the model system The breeding substrate will
be manipulated to measure responses at the levels of be-
haviour and population. We are particularly interested
in the inﬂuence of ecology and female behaviour on the
coexistence of alternative life history morphs within a
species. Again, lab and ﬁeld work will complement each
other.
Candidates should have a masters degree (or Diplom)
in Biology and research experience in animal behaviour,
a ﬁrm, theoretical background in behavioural or evolu-
tionary ecology, and a strong commitment to basic sci-
ence. Practical skills in the work with ﬁsh, both under
water and in the lab will be very helpful. The person
appointed will be collaborating with the other mem-
bers of the group, which will include approximately 4
advanced research staﬀ, 5 PhD-students and a varying
number of masters students.
Besides research, PhD students are expected to assist in
undergraduate teaching and supervision, with a train-
ing load not exceeding 10 percent of working time.
Salaries will follow the scheme of the province of Bern
and the Swiss National Research Foundation (approx.
32,000.- to 38,000.- CHF/year).
Closing date: Open until ﬁlled, but all application ma-
terials, including CV, a summary of research experi-
ence, copies of any published or in-press papers if ap-
plicable, and 2 letters of recommendation, should be
received by April 15, 2004 to assure full consideration.
The position will start at the earliest possible date and
will be for three years. Candidates should indicate in a
cover letter when they could take up the position.

UCanterbury EvolCommunications
Ph.D. Scholarship in Animal Communication at the
University of Canterbury
We are seeking a Ph.D. student to study mechanisms
of social communication in archaic New Zealand frogs
(genus Leiopelma). These frogs are “living fossils” that
have remained virtually unchanged over the past 200
million years and never evolved bioacoustic signalling
systems. Leiopelma are extremely long-lived, do not
stray far from small home ranges, and repeatedly in-
teract with the same individuals. These conditions fos-
ter the formation of complex social networks, which
might be structured through chemical signalling. The
project takes an integrative approach and makes use
of microsatellite analyses to investigate genetic related-
ness, chemical methods to characterise the signals, and
ﬁeld studies to examine how communication occurs in
natural populations. For further background, see Be-
havioral Ecology 15 (1): 88-93 (2004).
The scholarship is supported for three years by the
Marsden Fund (Royal Society of New Zealand) and
includes a $19,000/year tax-free stipend, full interna-
tional tuition/fees, and generous support for research
expenses.
The University of Canterbury has a strong programme
in behaviour, ecology, and evolution, as well as excel-
lent facilities in chemistry and molecular genetics. The
programme is directed by Bruce Waldman (School of
Biological Sciences) and John Blunt (Department of
Chemistry).
The deadline for applications is 15 June 2004. For fur-
ther information, please contact us. To apply, send
your Curriculum Vitae, a letter detailing your expe-
rience and career goals, and contact details for three

We are currently seeking students with interests in ge-
nomics, evolution and bioinformatics to conduct re-
search on microsatellite evolution. Positions are avail-
able immediately for a period of 3 years.
Project Description Microsatellites are abundant,
highly variable, repeated DNA sequences that are re-
garded as the most versatile genetic markers yet discov-
ered. They are the cornerstone of the current biological
revolution and are used in gene mapping, DNA forensic
work, and as population markers. Conclusions drawn
from such studies in many cases depend critically on
assumptions about how microsatellites evolve. Current
models of microsatellite evolution are overly simplistic
and almost certainly incorrect, leading to widespread
data misinterpretation. To avoid continued misinter-
pretation, it is vital that we understand fully how mi-
crosatellites evolve. This project will investigate the
processes governing microsatellite evolution by compar-
ing microsatellite sequences derived from the human,
mouse, rat and other genome projects using a com-
bination of bioinformatics and comparative molecular
genetics.
The Ideal Candidate The ideal candidate will possess
experience in both molecular genetics and bioinformat-
ics. They will be motivated and organised, with a
demonstrated capacity to master the broad skill set nec-
essary for the successful completion of a research pro-
gram that will span molecular genetics, bioinformatics
and biomathematics. They will be a competent labo-
ratory worker, with experience of all routine molecular
genetic techniques, particularly microsatellite genotyp-
ing and sequencing, and should be computer literate
with familiarity with database management and statis-
tical analyses. Minimum qualiﬁcations: B.Sc. (Hons),
M.Sc. in Genetics, Molecular Biology or equivalent.
Remuneration Students will receive an annual stipend
of NZ$19,000 plus local fees for 3 years. Please note
that students from countries other than New Zealand,
Germany, France, and Australia will normally be re-
quired to pay international fees currently NZ$23,000
per annum which will not be covered by the stipend.
Additional scholarships for international fees are avail-May 1, 2004 EvolDir 13

ULondon PopulationDynamics
PhD studentship: Mathematical modelling of the pop-
ulation dynamics of a predator with multiple prey
Supervisor: Vincent AA Jansen School of Biological
Sciences, Royal Holloway - University of London.
The modelling of predator and prey dynamics is a well-
studied problem in ecology, yet the majority of the re-
search has focused on the interaction between a single
prey and one predator. The interaction between one
predator and multiple prey is less well studied, despite
the fact that in general there are more prey species than
predator species. This project aims to develop a mech-
anistic model for the population dynamics of a predator
feeding on multiple prey species.
The modelling of the interaction between a predator
and prey hinges on the descriptions of the functional
and numerical responses. For the interaction between
a predator and a single prey the standard description
is that of a Holling type II functional response. For
the interaction between a predator and more than one
prey a Holling type III functional response is often used,
however this description is not based on a mechanistic
underpinning. This project aims to model the interac-
tion between a predator and multiple prey species on a
mechanistic basis and explore the resulting population
dynamics and the evolution of the interaction. There
are a number of fundamental questions that can be ad-dressed in the context of this research: how diﬀerent do
prey need to be in order to coexist? How many prey
species can coexist if predated upon by a single preda-
tor? What are the spatio-temporal dynamics? What
are the evolutionary consequences? The results of this
theoretical project can potentially be applied to biolog-
ical control or conservation issues.
This project will involve model formulation and math-
ematical analysis, supplemented with computer simu-
lations. It will suit a biologist with an aﬃnity for
mathematical modelling, or graduates from a disci-
pline with a substantial mathematical content (e.g
mathematics, physics or computer science) with an
aﬃnity for biology. If you fullﬁl these requirements
but would like to do a PhD in mathematical biology
on a subject of your own choice, please contact the
supervisor. The studentship is a Thomas Holloway
studentship (see http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Studying/-
Graduate-School/pgfunding2.html ) and covers fees and
subsistence for UK or EU residents. To apply please
follow the instructions on http://www.rhul.ac.uk/-
studying/Admissions/pgapplication.html . Please also
provide two letters of reference which should be send
directly to the supervisor. The deadline for applica-
tions is 4 June 2004.

This studentship is available from October 2004 to work
with Prof. Roger Butlin on the Chorthippus paral-
lelus hybrid zone on the French-Spanish border. It will
combine quantitative genetic and gene expression based
approaches to hybrid sterility which is observed in F1
males but not in the hybrid zone, apparently because
of displacement of clines for incompatible alleles.
The studentship will be held in the Department of An-May 1, 2004 EvolDir 15

NERC Centre for Population Biology Imperial College
London, Silwood Park
Summary of Post:
An experimental biologist to work on the population
biology of micro-organisms. Our current work in this
area includes work on experimental evolution in yeast
and spatial processes in bacteria.
One of the research themes of the CPB ( http://-
www.cpb.bio.ic.ac.uk/ ) is microbial ecology which cur-
rently includes three projects. (i) Spatial process in
bacteria: using Pseudomonas bacteria we are currently
studying a range of phenomena such as plasmid mainte-
nance and metabolic parasitism in bioﬁlms. (ii) Exper-
imental evolution in yeast: we have been investigating
the evolution of sex by genetically manipulating yeast
so that they cannot go through meiosis and than com-
paring adaptation to novel environments. (iii) Commu-
nity structure of protists: we have been testing theo-
ries in community ecology by constructing food webs
involving algae, ciliates and other protists. We seek
an experimental biologist, ideally with a background
in microbial population biology, who will develop a re-
search programme to extend or complement these exist-
ing projects. The CPB has extensive molecular micro-
bial facilities (including DNA sequencing and real-time
PCR), a major chemostat facility, and increasing equip-
ment for the visualisation of bacteria in bioﬁlms. Our
work on bacteria is conducted jointly with a group at
CEH Oxford led by Professor Mark Bailey.
Knowledge / Experience: You should have a PhD in
microbial ecology or a closely related discipline. Can-
didate should have expertise in the area of microbial
ecology or related area.
Salary and Conditions: The contract is for 3 years. Re-
search and Education scale B, £19068 - £28842. Ap-
plicants would normally be expected to have submitted
their PhD prior to taking up the appointment. This
is an Imperial College scale and is equivalent to the
R&A1A scale in other universities. Starting salary de-
pends upon experience, and partly on age, rising within
the scale in annual increments dependant on perfor-mance. Normal university conditions apply, including
optional membership of pension schemes.
Applications : Your application should clearly highlight
your qualiﬁcations, experience, abilities and attitudes
that are speciﬁcally relevant to this position, giving ev-
idence and examples where possible . General, non-
speciﬁc applications will not be suﬃcient.

Allee eﬀect
Dear Evoldir,
We are working on the Allee eﬀect, a dynamical process
by which populations at small sizes, or low densities,
experience a reduction of growth rate and an increased
risk of extinction.
We are looking for studies that have looked for such an
eﬀect, but that didn’t ﬁnd any. Such “negative” stud-
ies are diﬃcult to ﬁnd because they are typically not
published, yet they are of major importance in ecologyand conservation biology.
If you have heard of such “negative” results, could you
please ask the scientists concerned to contact me, or
provide me with a way to contact them?
Please reply directly to me: franck.courchamp@ese.u-
psud.fr Thank you very much in advance
(for those of you interested in ﬁnding more on
the Allee eﬀect, several reviews are available here:

BirdBlood mRNA
We have been discussing the possibility to investigate
mRNA expression in blood obtained from birds in a
couple of long term studies. The rational behind using
blood is that we think this is the only way of obtain-
ing mRNA without jeopardizing the health of the birds.
We wonder whether some of you have information on
one or all of these 3 questions:
1) How much blood is needed (in microliter) for getting
suﬃcient amount of mRNA (enough for 100 PCRs)? Or
rather, what is the yield in terms of nano gram mRNA
/ micro liter blood?
2) What storage buﬀers are recommended? We are con-
sidering to use Qiagen’s RNAlater.
3) How many diﬀerent mRNA’s might be retrieved from
the blood of adult birds during the breeding season?

Colonisaton via micros
I am investigating population structure in Atlantic
salmon from a river in the UK. One of the four main
tributaries of this system has undergone a very recent
population expansion following the removal of an im-
passable barrier (weir removed in 1987). The tributary
was extensively restocked for 11 years with ﬁsh from
below the barrier but within the same tributary. I have
sampled 10 loci from fairly large sample sizes in all four
tributaries. My question is, how would I detect the re-
cent range / population expansion? I observe no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in heterozygosity or allelic richness
between tributaries. There is no signiﬁcant departure
from HWE in either tributary. Both Principal Compo-
nents Analysis and a NJ tree suggest that the recently
re-colonised tributary is diﬀerentiated from everything
else - and they are all quite similar.
Is it possible to test for mismatched distribution using
genetic distance (e.g. D, or DCE) in microsatellites, in
the same way as using sequence variation? And would
this be possible over so short a period of time?
Is there an easier method for investigating population
expansion using microsatellites?
Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

of the organizers, I would like to ask you for your help.
We are planning to have a book auction (and perhaps
other items like art or scientist memorabilia - whatever
that might mean), so we would appreciate contribu-
tions that might be considered valuable by the evolution
community. If you have written one or more books and
would be willing to contribute autographed copies, we
would be very grateful. Additionally, if you have any of
the classics available (e.g., books out of print and hard
to come by), those would certainly be welcome as well.
If you have ideas for other items that you think might
fetch some money, feel free to write me about them,
and we will consider their suitability. They can be silly
or serious items (e.g., perhaps and eraser thrown by Se-
wall Wright), as we hope this will be a fun event as well
as a money-maker. Please contact me directly - my info
is below. Best wishes, Shanna Carney

DNAsequence analysis answers
Hello everybody,
I recently inquired alternatives for the Sequencher soft-
ware (GeneCodes Corp.) that we use in the lab. There
were a couple of notions that a Sequencher Mac OSX
version 4.2 just became available, as well as sugges-
tions for alternative programs. One response mentioned
problems with a hardware key (probably for the dongle
version?) when running the classic program in OSX. I
remember we also encountered such problems. A good
alternative may be Codoncode Aligner. Below, I com-
piled some of the responses that I received since then.My inquiry: I wonder whether you could name a good
and reasonably prized DNA sequence analysis software
that you are routinely using in the lab. We are using
Gene Codes’ Sequencher so far, mostly for proofread-
ing of ABI sequence chromatograms and (small) contig
assembly. However, it seems that the Mac version is
running only in the classic environment on Mac OS X
machines. I ﬁnd this a bit outdated considering that OS
X is already three years old. Also, there seems to be no
improvement regarding functionality when comparing
our current Sequencher v3 with the latest v4.1.
Reponses:
I recently downloaded the demo of sequencher and was
also disapointed that is was still in classic. I asked the
company and they assured me that the latest version
was OSX, just not the demo.
We just got Sequencher 4.2, which runs natively in OS
X. You might want to ask Gene Codes about it. It
otherwise appears to be pretty much the same as v4.1.
Like you, we’ve been quite frustrated by the pace of
their development.
I use Sequencher. The newest version runs in OS X.
There is no huge diﬀerence from earlier versions, but a
number of incremental improvements. However, I don’t
know of an adequate cheap substitute. If I did, I would
use that instead, because I consider GendCodes’ mo-
nopolistic practices to be immoral.
I’m in the process of trying out CodonCode Aligner,
I can’t go as far as recommending it but it has been
recommend it to me. If you look at the price tag,
though, you’ll see that it’s much more aﬀordable than
Sequencher. http://www.codoncode.com/
A free sequence viewer/editing program which is really
good is 4Peaks, which is available FREE from http://-
www.mekentosj.com/4peaks/ - currently this program
does not contig so it might not be ideal for what you
want but it is deﬁnately a nice interface to use - give it
a try! This website also has a couple of other nice bi-
ology programs for OS X. On the topic of Sequencher.
We have recently got a G5 and have ordered the OS
X upgrade for Sequencher - however in the interim we
would like to be able to use Sequencher in the classic
environment in 10. Only problem is that the Mac will
not recognise the hard key. How did you get around
this problem so that you could run your old version of
sequencher in classic?
we really like Codoncode Aligner http://-
www.codoncode.com/ I highly recommend it, good
functionality, very reasonably priced, and the guys
seem happy to talk, take suggestions and give support.May 1, 2004 EvolDir 27
people in my lab recommend that, if you are running a
Mac with OS X, you try EMBOSS ( www.emboss.org ).
This is an open source clone of GCG; it can be compiled
and run under Mac OS X. Further, there are third-party
graphical interfaces which function under darwin. (By
the way, all of this is free!) I haven’t used any of this
but know that, after some discussion, it seems to be the
favorite for a mac environment here.
My lab and our shared DNA sequencing facility use Se-
quencher. The latest release is 4.2 on the Mac, which is
OSX native. It also has a few small improvements each
release. Although Sequencher is expensive, we ﬁnd it
useful due to its menu driven interface and ease of use as
well as the availability of essentially identical versions
on Macs and PCs.

DNAsequence analysis more
Hi, I missed this earlier discussion but have this ques-
tion - does Codoncode Aligner allow you to import ﬁles
previously set up in Sequencher?
If they have this function or were willing to provide this
function, I and I bet others, would love to jump ship
from the ABI oligarchy. They really seem to care less
about devlopment and they charge an arm and a leg
for their stuﬀ.

DNAsequence analysis more2
Hi Georgiana and everyone else,
I have been trying out Aligner for the last few weeks(they have a month-long trial lisence) and asked about
opening Sequencher projects a couple of weeks ago. Pe-
ter Richterich at CodonCode Corp. gave me a quick,
clear response - basically he suggested exporting indi-
vidual sequences or the contig in a standard format
from Sequencher. This morning I forwarded your ques-
tion on to him and asked for more clariﬁcation. His two
emails are pasted below.
I have found Aligner relatively easy to learn and more
useful than Sequencher in a few ways. Especially cool
is its ability to automatically detect possible point mu-
tations in assemblies using of Phred and Phrap base
quality values.
Here are Peter’s two emails:
1. Hi Sky,
>Can Aligner open Sequencher ﬁles? I have a bunch
that I would love to >import and re-analyze/ evaluate
with Aligner.
Aligner cannot currently open Sequencher projects di-
rectly. What you can do is export the sequences in a
project, either as SCF ﬁles or as a CAF assembly, and
then import the chromatogram ﬁles into Aligner.
After importing chromatograms this way, make sure to
ﬁrst base call the imported ﬁles from Aligner, so that
you have quality values. Many Aligner functions work
better with quality values, or require them, and Se-
quencher does not write them into SCF ﬁles.
Best regards,
Peter
. Hi Sky,
Thank you for your email. I think I will refrain from
posting directly to the news group at this time, since it
might look too much like a sales pitch. But let me ex-
pand on my previous answer on importing Sequencher
projects:
The request to directly read Sequencher projects has
come up several times, so we will deﬁnitely look into
it. Since Sequencher uses a proprietary format, we can-
not predict how long this will take - it depends on how
easy it is to ﬁgure out the format. The more promising
approach, which we may well implement ﬁrst, is to sup-
port importing of CAF-formatted assemblies. The CAF
format is public and well described, and Sequencher can
export CAF assemblies.
This said, I still think that exporting SCF ﬁles from
Sequencher and importing the ﬁles into Aligner is of-
ten the best solution, for the following reason: Se-
quencher does not support modern algorithms that use
local alignments and sequence quality scores to build28 EvolDir May 1, 2004
the “consensus” sequence, but Aligner does. The rec-
ommended approach in Aligner is to import SCF (or
ABI) ﬁles, and then re-call the bases with Phred di-
rectly from Aligner to get reliable quality scores that
can be used in assembly. For example, in areas with
two-fold coverage, Sequencher will call an ambiguity
base for the consensus at every discrepancy. In con-
trast, CodonCode Aligner will use the quality scores to
automatically pick the higher quality base for the con-
sensus sequence. This can reduce the amount of editing
and ﬁnishing dramatically, and give you a lower error
rate in the ﬁnished sequence. I attached two screen
shots as an example.
Please feel free to post any of this email or the previous
email to the newsgroup you mentioned if you think it
is relevant.

As part of an investigation of naturally-occurring trans-
position into heat-shock genes, we are interested in
screening Drosophila melanogaster populations recently
collected from the wild. We hope to examine a world-
wide sample of populations collected from diverse en-
vironments. If you have a recently (2000 or later) col-
lected population of reasonable size that you’d be will-
ing to share, please get in touch. Some regions are
already represented in our collection, but we would be
particularly interested in populations from the follow-
ing regions:
USA north of Arizona and west of the the Mississippi
River Canada Europe outside of France Asia outside of
India Paciﬁc Oceania
We are looking forward to hear from you. Thanks in

III.1.2 Genomics for terrestrial biodiversity and ecosys-
tem research Development of genomic and molecular
approaches to enable the understanding of terrestrial
biodiversity and as far as feasible ecosystems struc-
tures, dynamics and processes in a changing environ-
ment, to improve society’ s capacity to conserve and
manage biodiversity and genetic resources. The se-
lected taxa should have important conservation or func-
tional attributes. The work should comprise a multidis-
ciplinary approach aimed at improving understanding
population genetic structures, dynamics and ecosystem
processes, the identiﬁcation of species and evolution-
ary relationships between taxa. This novel knowledge
should also be made available for education, ecosystem
monitoring, and the development of biodiversity conser-
vation strategies. The participation of third countries
partners is encouraged. (Topic for up-to-one Integrated
Project)

Fish specimens Mexico
I am assembling a list of non-Mexican professional bi-
ologists who are doing research with native Mexican
ﬁshes and need to collect specimens for genetic, mor-
phological or behavioral studies. It is becoming increas-
ingly diﬃcult to obtain collecting permits from appro-
priate agencies of the Mexican government, and many
people have become quite discouraged. In quite a few
cases, collecting permits have not been granted or have
taken impractically long periods of time. My ultimate
goal is to be able to coordinate permit applications,
perhaps thorugh a central, organized “clearing house,
” or perhaps through a Mexican professional society. If
we can doucment the number of people doing this re-
search, and the fact that much of it is funded by NSF
and other federal granting agencies, we may be able to
elicit help from the US government or even get the issue
negotiated at the ambassadorial level.
Consequently, if you are doing work with native Mex-
ican ﬁshes, I would very much like to hear from you
with as much informatyion as you care to supply: the
species you work with, the funding of your work, the
number of collecting trips you have made, whether you
are collaborating with a Mexican colleague, the nature
of your permit, how you got it, whether you had to pay
a fee, etc. Please do not supply any information you
do not want to be made public eventually, and let me
know if you do not wish to be identiﬁed by name in
any data cimpilation. I do already know some of this
information, but I would like to be able to work with
as much data as possible.
Please do participate. At the very least, we can share
our pain and frustration, and we might even accom-
plish something. – ***** Bruce J. Turner Dept. Biol-

Dear all,
I wonder if anyone knows about any PC software (free,
if possible) that can import Genescan and Genotyper
ﬁles generated from an ABI377. I remember there used
to be one a couple of years ago, but I can’t remember
its name and if it is still available. Any help is very
much appreciated. Cheers. Ricardo

Genescan ﬁles answers
Dear all
Thanks a lot to all of you who replied to my question.
Many of you were also interested about the suggestions
I could get. Here they are.
My original question was:
I wonder if anyone knows about any PC software (free,
if possible) that can import Genescan and Genotyper
ﬁles generated from an ABI377.
Below you will ﬁnd all the suggestions:
Hi Ricardo–
Genographer allows you to score fragment
bands from ABI machines. Its available free at
hordeum.oscs.montana.edu/ genographer I hope that
helps!
Stuart
I’m pretty sure that ABI has a conversion software pro-
gram for Mac to PC. When they switched their se-
quencers to a PC format, they created a conversion
method so that folks midway through a project could
consolidate all their data on one platform. Their tech
support should know about it. Judith30 EvolDir May 1, 2004
Dear Ricardo
Genographer can use directly genescan ﬁles and it’s for
free!
here is the link: http://hordeum.oscs.montana.edu/-
genographer/ Good luck and cheers Vicky
Hi Richard,
the one program I know of is called GeneScanView and
you can get it from the University of Padua, Italy. How-
ever, this software does only import one lane at a time,
so you can’t do cross-comparisons very well. It’s good
enough for a “quick glance”, though. I for my part
ended up using Genotyper back at the lab that ana-
lyzed my samples.
You can get GeneScanView at: http://-
bmr.cribi.unipd.it . The site’s in Italian, but you
can easily ﬁnd the download link for the software.
Best wishes, -Christian
If it is for AFLP, maybe it is Genographer. It is
a free PC software you can download at http://-
hordeum.oscs.montana.edu/genographer/
The installation is not obvious (you have to use a short-
cut to open the application with Java).
The free version is a little bit unstable (lost of buttons
and sometimes problems with the redraw option) but
it is a very useful software to encode AFLP.
All the best Florence
Hi Ricardo,
There is a good program called STRand that you
can download for free from UC-Davis: http://-

Geometridae moths loci
Dear All,I am a PhD student at the University of Sheﬃeld, mod-
eling a metapopulation of the Winter moth inhabiting
Orkney, Scotland. As part of this study, I hope to use
microsatellite markers to gain an idea of relatedness
and dispersal between population patches on the dif-
ferent islands. I was wondering if anybody has devel-
oped microsatellite loci for Winter moth (Operophtera
brumata) or (probably more likely) from any species
belonging to the Family:Geometridae (Larentiinae).
Please send replies to bop03eoj@shef.ac.uk.

Glasgow TaxNameServer
The “Glasgow Taxonomy Name Server” ( http://-
darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/˜rpage/MyToL/www/ ) is an
experimental web site for ﬁnding taxonomic names and
classiﬁcations. At present it is populated with names
from ITIS and GenBank, with additional names from
Mammal Species of the World.
Users can type in a name (e.g., “Primates”) and can
browse the resulting classiﬁcation. The site features a
range of tools for displaying classiﬁcations, such as a
hyperbolic tree viewer, as well as providing classiﬁca-
tions in a range of formats for downloading (such as
XML, and dot and GML graph formats).
As well as ﬁnding names in the database, the server can
look for approximate matches (rather like Google’s “did
you mean” feature). For example, typing in “Dugong
dugong” retutns no hits, but the server will ask whether
you meant “Dugong dugong.”
The site is experimental, and heavily biased towards
animals. It is mainly a test bed for research on how
to query, display, and compare classiﬁcations. There
is also some support for web services (enabling remote
querying of other databases).
I would welcome any feedback, comments, or sugges-
tions.

John Maynard Smith
Dear Evolutionists,
With the greatest possible sadness, I am writing to tell
you that we have just lost one of the greatest minds everto consider the subject of biological evolution. John
Maynard Smith passed away yesterday at home, while
sitting in his chair.
John had just ﬁnished his latest book (on animal com-
munication, with David Harper) and has recently been
working on various theoretical and empirical problems,
particularly in bacterial population genetics. He had
also started work on a new edition of his book on the
Major Transitions in Evolution (with Eors Szathmary).
He was thinking, working, and helping his colleagues
until the very end.
He was not totally comfortable in the last months of
his life (mostly due to breathing diﬃculties) but he was
not suﬀering very badly either.
Professor Maynard Smith is survived by his wife, Sheila,
and his three children, Anthony, Carol and Julian.
Yours, Joel

Lepidopteran phylogeny answers
Dear all, Because a number of people have shown in-
terest in the answers to my query of March 17 2004
about Lepidopteran divergence times, I have made a
summary list of the e-mails I received. Unfortunately,
there seems to be more interest than answers as far as
Lep phylogenies with time calibration are concerned.
I thank all those who sent me information. Sincerely,
Patricia Beldade ....32 EvolDir May 1, 2004
ANTONIA MONTEIRO: In relation to your (and
Tony’s) question about divergence dates, here is what
I have found out from the Kristensen (1999) book and
also from the web: Oldest fossil Hymenoptera - 225 MY
Oldest fossil Diptera - 228 MY Oldest fossil Lepidoptera
- 200 MY Since Hymenoptera is thought to have split
before the Diptera - Lepidoptera split (see Tree of Life),
the split between Diptera and Lepidoptera is at least
228 MY old. Now within the Lepidoptera: There are
&quot;only&quot; around 600-700 fossils known, 500
of which preserved in resin (which helps in the cor-
rect identiﬁcation). Oldest fossils of Noctuoidea (from
Kristensen’s morphological phylogeny this superfamily
originated at the same time as the Bombycoidea (where
Bombyx belongs), which does not contain any known
fossils) - 55MY Oldest fossil of Geometroidea (a lineage
that split after the Noctuoidea) - 65MY Oldest fossil
of a hesperid butterﬂy (superfamilies Hesperioidea +
Papilionoidea, which originated after the Noctuoidea
and Bombycoidea) - 65 MY Oldest fossil of Pyraloidea
(a lineage that split before the Noctuoidea) - 65MY
So, putting it all together, Bicyclus and Bombyx are
at least 65 million years apart... Recommended read-

Matrilines answers
Dear Evoldir members,
A couple of weeks ago I posted following query:
“Does anyone know a software able to calculate num-
ber of matrilines, when microsatellite data of progeny
only are available? I work on Hymenoptera, so data are
haplo-diploid (females are diploid and males are hap-
loid) and I assume single mating.”
I’ve received a few useful advices, which I’m very grate-
ful for!
Also, I’ve learnt that others would be interested in this
topic too, so here below are summarized the answers
I’ve got:
Dear Monika,
In answer to your query on EvolDir, check out Mate-
Soft, which was
speciﬁcally written by my colleague Jes Soe Pedersen

Dear Monica
unfortunately I do not have directly a software for you,
but your query inspires me to send you as a private re-
ply a pdf ﬁle of an old paper in which, given a known
number of potential mothers, we used microsatellites to
infer the relative shares of maternity among workers (I
also add a TREE review on the topic). I hope that it
may be of some interest to you. As for your problem I
would start by Queller & Goodnight Evolution paper.
Best of luck with your work

Dear Monika,
The program COLONY does what you seek, using ML.
It was ﬁrst described and used in:
Chapman RE, Wang J, Bourke AFG (2003) Genetic
analysis of spatial foraging patterns and resource shar-
ing in bumble bee pollinators. Molecular Ecology 12,
2801-2808.
Robert
Kinship, mac freeware, enables you to determine such
sib-groups.
Then you can use coverage-based methods such as those
of Chao or the
ML equivalent of Pollock to estimate how many matri-
lines there are
that you didn’t see [if you want to go that far].
These approaches grew out of social Hymenoptera stud-
ies, and will
work better there than for organisms with both sexes
diploid.
Yours sincerely, Ross Crozier
Many thanks!!!!!!!!!!

Micros species
Dear all,
I am trying to show that two ant species are hybridiz-
ing. Specimens that are seperable into two species by
morphology share the same haploktype. Additionally
we have microsatellite data of the same three loci of
these two species that share some alleles but seem to
be clearly seperated otherwise (a number of private al-
leles and diﬀerences in allele frequencies).
My question is: Am I aloud to use F-statistics to show
that the individuals are separated even though it seems
to be very clear that this cannot be a population in34 EvolDir May 1, 2004
HWE?
Or does anybody know a programme that may be used
to assign individuals to either species via a maximum
likelihood approach (i.e. that gives me a result like the
specimens can be classiﬁed as belonging to two separate
species with XY probability)?
Thank you for your help!

Hallo
was Du beschreibst ist natuerlich ein idealer Fall,

I’d try Jonathan Pritchard’s structure pro-
gram. There’s a link on his website http://-
pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/ . It’s for identifying pop-
ulations within a species, but I think you could use it
to establish the number of groups that you have and
to assign individuals to groups by genetics. You can
then compare the assignments to the groups you get
by morphology. I’m not sure of the minimun number
of loci.

Dear Heike,
I have a similar issue with two recently diverged plant
species that share nearly all polymorphisms but are ex-
tremely diﬀerent morphologically. If there has been a
limited amount of new mutation in the respective lin-
eages, then Fst is a legitimate measure of divergence,
and -ln(1-Fst) should increase more or less linearly over
time. HWE is not a requirement for Fst estimates – in
fact Fst and other F statistics basically partition the
deviations from HWE and would be zero if all the data
represented a single population under HWE.
The most useful tool for assigning individuals to an-
cestral populations or estimating their admixture is
Jonathan Pritchard’s STRUCTURE program which
uses a Bayesian approach to infer each individual’s an-
cestry from marker data. However, you would want
data from far more than three microsatellite loci to do
this. Even if the loci are highly polymorphic, a more
comprehensive sampling of the genome would be im-
portant, especially if hybridization is suspected.
>>>>>
Hi Heike Feldhaar,
You can used STRUCTURE software (Pritchard et al.,
2000). It is a Bayesian clustering procedure imple-
mented, designed to identify the K (unknown) popu-
lations of origin of the sampled individuals and assign
the individuals simultaneously to the populations. TheMay 1, 2004 EvolDir 35
most likely value of K is assessed by comparing the like-
lihood of the data for diﬀerent values of K. However, I
am very interesting in any reply that you received,

Moller petition
Dear Colleagues,
As some of you are aware, recently there have been ac-
cusations of unethical conduct directed at one of our
colleagues, Anders Pape Moller. As someone who has
collaborated with Dr. Moller for the past ﬁve years or
so, I wish to assure you that I personally have never had
any cause for concern in my dealings with him. I have
worked with Anders in the ﬁeld, in the lab, and have
written several papers with him. My observations sug-gest that his imme nse productivity has been the prod-
uct of his extreme dedication to science, especially the
natural history of birds, incredible organizational skills
(his undergraduate training was in library science), an
immense generosity towards students and colleagues,
a compulsive need to share his observation s through
peer reviewed publications, and more than a little nat-
ural talent . For those of you not familiar with his
work, Moller has written >400 peer reviewed papers
since 1982, and these have garnered over 4000 citations
fr om other scientists in the ﬁeld.
Although it is very diﬃcult to objectively evaluate such
cases, it has be come increasing clear that the recent
case against Moller has been in large part motivated by
a grudge on the part of a former colleague at the Univer
sity of Copenhagen. This colleague apparently lost his
job as a consequence of concerns raised by Moller dur-
ing his tenure at this institution. It has been suggested
that one reason for Moller’s accuser’s dismissal was a
pred ilection for unfounded charges of unethical behav-
ior. In addition, it is ap parent that the Danish com-
mittee that ruled against Moller, and the directo r of
Danish bird banding centre, were not in any way impar-
tial towards the case as they included former students
and supporters of Moller’s accuser. I t is astounding
that such committees would include members who so
clearly h ad conﬂicts of interest with the subject of the
investigation. The outcomes of this witch-hunt include
signiﬁcant personal and ﬁnancial distress and the revo-
cation of Moller’s Danish bird banding permit. One con
sequence of the latter outcome will be the termination
of a 34 year, long t erm study of barn swallows in north-
ern Denmark. I am certain that no matter what your
personal feelings might be towards Anders Moller, we
can all agr ee that basic long term datasets are in very
short supply and are fundament al for the investigation
of basic ecological and conservation principles.
As a consequence of the perceived lack of impartiality in
the proceedings t o date, we have assembled a petition
directed at the Danish Minister of Sci ence, Technology,
and Innovation, Members of the Danish Natural Science
Res earch Council, the Head of the Copenhagen Ring-
ing Centre and the Head of th e Zoological Museum,
Copenhagen, asking them to reconsider their decision
t o revoke Moller’s banding permit, and to conduct an
impartial inquiry into the proceedings that led to the
current controversy. The petition can be fo und at:
http://www.ipetitions.com/campaigns/Moller/ . I urge
you to sign th is petition if you are concerned about
fair and impartial treatment of such cases.
Those of you wishing to contact Danish authorities on
your own may do so at the addresses given below.36 EvolDir May 1, 2004

Moller petition 2
Dear Colleagues,
At the urging of my friend and colleague, Richard
Palmer (and a few other folks), I wish to clarify my
position concerning the Moller “situation”. I am very
much aware of the concerns about Moller’s potentially
unethical behavior (such as those that Rich Palmer has
presented). My comments concerning Moller’s conduct
only apply to the personal interactions I have had with
him over the past 5 years or so, and thus do not apply
to his professional conduct in general.
My motivations for becoming involved, and organiz-
ing a petition to revisit the Moller case ( http://-
www.ipetitions.com/campaigns/Moller/ ), are to sup-
port a fair and impartial evaluation of the circum-
stances surrounding the current case. It is impossible
to wade through the plethora of hearsay and innuendo
that have been circulating, and I will leave it to those
much more qualiﬁed than I to pass judgment based on
the objective data presented.
Sincerely,
Tim Mousseau

greatly appreciate any help you can oﬀer.
Many thanks to the EvolDir community.

PopGenet Teaching Software
Last year I asked “Can people recommend population
genetics software to use in teaching population genet-
ics? In particular, knowing about programs that in-
clude options for single and two-locus selection, genetic
drift, gene ﬂow, mutation, and inbreeding, or some of
these categories, would be useful. If you have used it in
class and found it successful, I would like to know that
as well.”
I received a number of responses and below is given
a list of some of the software packages (and the devel-
oper) most commonly used in demonstrating the eﬀectsMay 1, 2004 EvolDir 37
of population genetics factors to students (with their
web sites).

winpop3.zip Virtually all of these packages cover the
basic eﬀects of selection, genetic drift, gene ﬂow, and
mutation. Populus appears to be the most widely
used from the responses I received and this package
also covers a number of more advanced topics, such as
two-locus selection and selection in diﬀerent environ-
ments. Some people suggested that for more advanced
understanding of these factors, it is often useful for
students to use spread sheets or programming to
generate the eﬀects of particular factors for themselves.

Pseudogene phylogeny
Dear members,
I have a set of mitochondrial sequences and their cor-
responding nuclear pseudogene sequences from several
vole species that I would like to use to construct a phy-
logeny. I have compared mitochondrial cytochrome b
sequences to their nuclear pseudogenes and have found
that the mitochondrial sequences are evolving more
rapidly. Rather than constructing a tree for each se-
quence type and comparing the resultant topologies, I
would like to incorporate them all into one tree but am
not sure of methods that will account for the diﬀerences
in their modes of evolution. I understand how to ﬁnd
appropriate models of substitution for a particular set
of sequences using software like PAUP* and Modeltest.
I am also aware of partitioning models along sequences
as with Mr. Bayes software. However, is there a way
to incorporate diﬀerent, appropriate models to accom-
modate the extreme diﬀerences in evolution betweenmitochondrial and nuclear sequences?
Thank you,

Running micros
Hi Everyone,
I have a large number of microsatellites I need to run.
I only have a 377 here with 36 wells, so I am looking
for alternatives. I was wondering if anyone has found a
good place to send them in 96-well plates? I can do the
PCRs here, I just need the reads. If you have the in-
formation, please indicate cost, whether or not the size
standard is included, and if there is an extra charge for
multiplexed samples.
Thanks so much for your help! Amy – Amy Baco-

I recommend buying some 96 toothed membrane combs
for the 377 gels. Get a tray with 96 wells that’s made38 EvolDir May 1, 2004
to dip the combs into. You’ll have to use the ﬂat short
plate (the one without the divet in it) to make your
gels. But these membrane combs work INCREDIBLY
well and in spite of what tehy say on teh package, can
be used up to 7 times each if you’re careful with them.
I am not sure where to buy them. Try “The gel com-
pany” in san francisco. You are likely to get others
tellign you this reply, possibly with more detail. but if
you need me to ask folks in my lab where they got hte
combs, i can do it. We use the ABI 3730 now.
Good luck,
ps. You can also multiplex the runs, even if the pcrs
themselves are not multiplexed. Get your labeleld
primers in diﬀerent color so that if there’s any over-
lap in size, the diﬀerent loci are in diﬀerent colors. The
more you separate them spatially, the better, though.
You can usually put 4-6 loci on a single gel, though, if
you plan carefully. So that’s 4 loci X 96 samples per
gel. Vastly increase your throughput.
Hy,
You might try genoscreen in France http://-

Hello Amy, check out the paper Toonen, R. J. and
Hughes, S. 2001. Increased throughput for fragment
analysis on an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer us-
ing a membrane comb and STRand software. Biotech-
niques 31: 1320-1324.
Their technique will let you load 100 lanes on a 377.
You’ll have to order paper combs (I use Catalog #
CAJ96) from the gelcompany.com, which cost $7.50
each. But I think it’s deﬁnitely worth it (and easier
to optimize loci when you’re running them yourself).
Good luck! Christiana

Hello Amy, I am sure you would prefer the place to be
in your own country! But if you are happy to send your
samples abroad then there is a service at the University
of Dundee in Scotland where you can send your samples
in 96-well plates.
http://www.dnaseq.co.uk/home.html The only price I
can see on the website is for DNA sequencing. If youonly need them to run the samples I am sure it will
be much cheaper but you will have to contact them di-
rectly to ask about this. Hope this helps, Kind Regards,
Lucy
Hi Amy,
We might be able to help you out with your usat runs.
We have an ABI3100 that is not running at full ca-
pacity. How many 96 well plates would you anticipate
and over what time period would you be able to deliver
them? Assuming you run a fair number of plates, we’d
probably be able to charge you $2 per sample.
One thing you might want to consider is that the mi-
gration of alleles may be slightly diﬀerent on a capillary
sequencer than on the slab gel - at least that’s what we
were told by the ABI folks. If you’re going to use data
from both, you’d probably want to run a set of indi-
viduals on both instruments so that you can calibrate
allele sizes, if necessary.
Let me know if you’re interested.

Dear Amy,
I saw your question on the evoldir, and I think you
might want to look into Nevada Genomics ( http://-
www.ag.unr.edu/genomics/ ). I think they charge less
than $200 to run a 96-well plate, which is a decent deal.
I have never used them for genotyping, but we send all
of our sequencing to them and they do a great job.

Squamate sex markers
Hi Evolution folks, I would like to determine the sex
of juvenile and embryonic Anolis lizards using a PCR
based method. This is commonly done in mammals us-
ing genes linked to the y-chromosome (such as SRY). I
believe that it has also been done in birds. Does anyone
know of genes found speciﬁcally on the y-chromosome
of any squamates (anoles are in fact XX:XY). Likely
candidates include spermiogenesis factors and related
genes but I cannot ﬁnd any description of these in the
literature or Genbank.
Any assistance and/or guidance would be appreciated.
Thanks a lot. Thom Sanger

mtDNA extraction answers
Reposted at the request of Douda Benasson
Subject: Other: mtDNA extractions/kits–answers
Date: Mon, 9 Jun 2003 02:19:51 -0400 (EDT)
I recently posted a query regarding isolation of ’pure’
mtDNA from tissue, blood, etc., for use in PCR-based
methods. I am grateful for all your responses– a big
thank you. It is a pleasure to correspond with mem-
bers of this group. The topic generated a lot of interest,
and I have included a summary of the responses below.
I apologise for any cross-postings. Thank you! Gabriela

Responses follow:
I used to use an old sucrose gradient or “pad” method
(swinging bucket ultracentrifuge required) that pro-
duced very clean mtDNA preps for bird tissues (blood
was not really doable). It required relatively fresh tis-
sues, or ones put into a sucrose/mannitol buﬀer, then
frozen. The mitochondria were isolated and could be
run through 2-3 times to really clean it up, followed by
DNA isolation.
Robert C. Fleischer
We used the Wizard miniprep kits (Promega). Other
such kits (I believe Qiagen also makes them) work well
too. Cesium chloride is a huge pain to work with; al-
though this way is more expensive, it is not nearly so
cumbersome or toxic. MF Smith (UC Berkeley) was
picking up a nuclear duplication of her mitochondrial
gene, and she published a paper on that. I believe that
paper included a more detailed description of her strat-
egy (which is what we used) for excluding nuclear DNA,
so that she could retrieve her true mtDNA gene copies
without the nuclear copy.
Tina Hambuch (protocol by Peg Smith)
WAKO Chemicals has a kit that uses a modiﬁed dif-ferential centrifugation procedure to obtain “enriched”
mtDNA. What you get is not as pure as by using CsCl,
but it is a lot faster. I have had rare cases of “pre-
sumed” pseudogenes when working with WAKO extrac-
tions, though.
Francesco Nardi
Reference below includes a quick simple method. You
need a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge.
S. M. Carr and O. M. Griﬃth (1987). Rapid isolation of
animal mitochondrial DNA in a small ﬁxed-angle rotor
at ultrahigh speed. “Biochemical Genetics,” 25:385-
390.
Any of the kit-based methods will let in nuclear con-
tamination, the above method gives good separation of
mt and nuc bands. We’re using it to purify reference
individuals for mtDNA clones. Never thought I’d be
doing CsCl gradient stuﬀ again.
Steve Carr
I think you will have a best chance to amplify the
mtDNA in two long PCR fragements. You could use
primers in very conservative regions like 12S and 16S
and obtain your mtDNA.
Gustavo Ybazeta
I noticed that numt are more common in blood tissues.
I had that problem with some of my blood samples
(from yellow warblers) but it never happened with my
quill samples. If you can’t ﬁnd a protocol that guar-
anties that the samples are free of nuclear DNA, I would
suggest you use quills and extract the DNA with the
SIGMA or QIAGEN extraction kits. When I did not
have any quill duplicates of my blood samples, I used a
diﬀerent set of primers that ampliﬁed a larger fragment
that contained the sequence I was interested in.
Marylene Boulet
I have used a sucrose gradient centrifugation in the past
to isolate whole mitochondria, from which you can ob-
tain a “mtDNA enriched” extract. This is often done
as a preliminary step before a CsCl protocol, but you
can stop after the sucrose gradient and have a reason-
ably good mtDNA prep. The following references about
numts may be helpful - there are some other approaches
besides purifying mtDNA.

lenge for avian systematics and population biology. The

pendent transpositions of mitochondrial DNA control

Michael Sorenson
Back before PCR was well-established, a number of ﬁsh
genetics labs used a technique developed by Bob Chap-
man and Denny Powers to carry out mitochondrially-
enriched extractions. It involved gently homogenizing
several grams of liver tissue in a TEKS buﬀer (TE with
KCl and sucrose), going through a series of low- and
high-speed centrifugations to remove nuclei and pel-let mitochondria, then lysing mitochondrial membranes
with a nonionic detergent (NonIDet). The resultant
DNA wasn’t pure mitochondrial DNA, but it was highly
enriched for mtDNA. Blood should work very well, and
potentially much better.
The reference for this method is:

Inference of demographic history of human populations
by means of multi-locus analyses of genetic polymor-
phisms
Oﬀer description: For those many human populations
which origin or history is unknown, the inference of de-
mographic history is achievable by means of population
genetics methods. Such indirect approaches rely on the
proper modelling of complex phenomena, like demog-
raphy, mutation and recombination processes. How-
ever, most of the methods developed so far do not ac-
count for the distribution of polymorphism at several
loci: instead, one generally assumes that genetic poly-
morphism is identically and independently distributed
across loci. Yet, the distribution of genetic variation
may bring more information than the average varia-
tion across loci. Hence, multi-locus approaches may be
valuable to estimate past demographic transitions (e.g.,
changes in the mode and strength of dispersal, changes
in population size or social structure). Owing to recent
theoretical developments, it is now possible to derive
coalescent models that account for the association of
genes at distinct loci. Therefore, this project aims at
developing new methods to infer demographic history
of human populations, from multi-locus data. These
methods will then be applied to the data from nomadic
populations in Central Asia, which are studied by the
research team. The goal is to test diﬀerent demographic
scenarios: Did Eastern and Western populations meet
recently and then became sedentary, or do they share44 EvolDir May 1, 2004
a more ancient history with successive colonisations?
Candidate proﬁle:
The successful should have a PhD or equivalent in
population genetics, as well as a strong background
in mathematical modelling. In particular, a good ex-
pertise in coalescent theory will be essential for this
project.

A postdoctoral post is available in a Wellcome Trust
Functional Genomics Development Initiative project in
the laboratories of Dr. Peter Keightley and Prof. Brian
Charlesworth to study molecular evolutionary processes
in Drosophila. The start date is negotiable.
How many mutations occur in the genome each gen-eration? What are the molecular properties of these
mutations? What fraction of them are deleterious, and
do most deleterious mutations occur in coding or non-
coding DNA? These issues are important for several
key questions in evolutionary biology, such as the evo-
lution of sexual reproduction and recombination, the
maintenance of variation, and the pattern of varia-
tion in the genome. However, evaluating the role of
deleterious mutations requires knowledge of parame-
ters that are extremely diﬃcult to measure, and the
role of deleterious mutations is currently unresolved.
Our project is to develop an integrated approach that
compares the genomes of related species, and directly
estimates genome-wide mutation rates that will enable
us to tackle these questions. Our plan of research is a
follows.
- We shall develop approaches to estimate the level of
functional constraints on noncoding DNA sequences by
comparing rates of evolution in noncoding DNA with
rates of evolution in adjacent genes.
- We shall apply these methods to new sequence data on
the related Drosophila species generated in our own lab-
oratory - D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda - along with
publicly available data from genome sequence projects
of D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. melanogaster.
- We shall develop a new approach for obtaining di-
rect estimates of the nucleotide mutation rate, based
on Denaturing High Pressure Liquid Chromatography
(DHPLC) technology for detecting rare sequence dif-
ferences. We shall estimate the genome-wide mutation
rate in inbred lines of Drosophila that have undergone
c.200 generations of random mutation accumulation.
Main tasks
- Develop methods and computer programs for esti-
mating the level of functional constraints in noncoding
DNA.
- Apply the methods to analyse genome sequence data
on homologous regions of Drosophila species.
- Work with a laboratory-based postdoctoral scientist
as a part of a team to estimate the per nucleotide mu-
tation rate in Drosophila by DHPLC (optional).

BBSRC THEORETICAL GENETICS AND EVOLU-
TION SUMMER SCHOOL Nottingham University 23-
27 August 2004
Second Mailing: Closing Date for Applications:- 30th
April 2004
The BBSRC will be running a summer school for
Postgraduate and Postdoctoral researchers working on
quantitative aspects of evolutionary biology, dealing
with variation both within and between species. We
are looking for applications from young scientists who
take an ongoing and broad interest in molecular evo-
lutionary biology, and wish a greater understanding of
quantitative and theoretical tools and approaches that
will aid their interpretation of evolutionary data. Those
chosen for the school will be asked to present a short
seminar about their research project, and there will also
be plenary talks and practical sessions.
The Summer School will cover the following areas of
micro- and macroevolution:
Theme A: Genetic diversity within populations The
neutral theory and the coalescent Mutation Human
minisatellites Genomic context and molecular evolu-
tion Theme B: Genetic variability between popula-tions. Theme C: Macroevolution and variation between
species Alignment of sequences Reconstruction of Phy-
logenetic Trees, Detecting natural selection from gene
genealogies Gene families, Gene duplications in evolu-
tion Genome alignment: Theme D: Evolution of devel-
opment Theme E: Evolution in microorganisms
Lecturers will include: Des Higgins (Cork Univer-
sity), Peter Keightley, Brian Charlesworth and Debo-
rah Charlesworth (Edinburgh University), David Con-
way (London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine),
John Armour, John Brookﬁeld, and Paul Sharp (Uni-
versity of Nottingham), Michael Akam (Cambridge
University) Gil McVean (Oxford University), Adam
Eyre-Walker (Sussex University),
Accomodation expenses for participants at this course
(but not travel to Nottingham) will be covered by the
BBRSC.

RiodeJaneiro Complexity Nov 3
Apologies to those of you who have received this work-
shop calling notice via another route or have no interest
in the event. Hi All This is the last general email I send
out regarding the forthcoming Complexity and Philos-
ophy Workshop to be held in Brazil in November.
Currently many more of you have shown interest (about
100) in the event than we can accommodate (30). We
could of course make the event much bigger, but we are
keen to keep the numbers low and more intimate than is
possible with a larger gathering. We may work towards52 EvolDir May 1, 2004
putting together a larger conference in the future, but
for now we’d like to focus on the workshop.
Getting to Brazil for many of us cannot be a last minute
exercise and so rather than keep the proposed submis-
sion dates as they are I propose a slight change. Ex-
tended abstracts will now be due at the end of May so
that a decision can be made regarding submission of a
full paper by the end of June, rather than the end of
August as previously proposed. It is hoped that this
will avoid disappointing prospective attendees long be-
fore the event itself, as well as give attendees more time
to prepare for the event.
A couple of points I’d like to stress (which come in re-
sponse to some of the communications we have received
so far):
Please bear in mind that this is NOT a management
science event. Our aim is to talk about the philosoph-
ical implications of complexity theory at a more gen-
eral abstract level. I’m sure that during the discussions
examples of management strategies will be used to ex-
emplify/clarify a particular philosophical idea, but this
will not be the focus of the event. I feel the need to state
this as we have already received a number of papers
of the general sort “Managing Creativity in Organisa-
tions” - this is not what is meant by ‘philosophical’ in
the context of this particular event. “The Role of Cre-
ativity in Understanding Complex Systems” would cer-
tainly be relevant however. So please be sure to pay at-
tention to the workshop themes listed in the calling no-
tice (attached below) before submitting abstracts. My
secondpoint may cause a few political problems. The
aim of a workshop is to talk, not to spend the majority
of listening to presentations. As such it is unlikely that
more then 5-6 papers will be ’formally’ presented dur-
ing the event, so thatmuch of the time can be devoted
to critical discussion (in either roundtable format or in
break sessions). These papers will be chosen from the
30 or so submitted and will likely focus on the themes
listed in the calling notice. However, asking our insti-
tutions to pay for a trip to go and ’talk’ in Brazil may
be a diﬃcult sell for some of you. Even if a submitted
paper is not presented it will certainly be included in
a proceedings, and considered for either book or jour-
nal publication - our hope is that this approach will
be suﬃcient for you to meet the requirements of your
respective institutions. All papers will be made avail-
able before the event so that each participant might
familiarise him/herself with some of the perspectives
on display. The boundaries of the event will not just be
the two-days we have in Brazil -we hope some level of
dialogue, or at least preparation, will start longer be-
fore that. Encouraging paper submission is of course a
way of facilitating this. That’s it for now. Please ﬁndfull details of the event below. We look forward to re-
ceiving your abstracts and very much look forward to
working with you all to organise an exciting, and maybe
profound, event!

Announcing a workshop and working group on reticu-
lated evolution. The workshop will be held September
20-21, 2004 and the working group on September 22,
2004. Registration details and further information for
the workshop may be obtained from the website
http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Reticulated
The working group is open by invitation only. In-
vitations may be obtained by contacting one of the
organizers. The organizing committee consists of Mel
Janowitz, DIMACS, melj@dimacs.rutgers.edu; Randy
Linder, University of Texas, rlinder@mail.utexas.edu;
Bernard Moret, University of New Mexico,
moret@cs.unm.edu A brief description of the goals of
these events follows.
Species evolution has long been modeled as a branch-
ing process that can uniquely be represented by a tree
topology. In such a topology, each species can only be
linked to its closest ancestor, while interspecies rela-
tionships such as species hybridization or lateral gene
transfer in bacteria are not allowed. With the advent of
phylogenetic analysis at the molecular level, there is in-
creasing evidence that such a model is inadequate. This
workshop will explore the history and latest status of
these new models of “reticulate evolution”, and will be
coupled with a smaller working group meeting designed
to explore promising avenues for future research.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
