tion***
*23rd - 25th September, 2013*
* Beijing, China*
*Objectives*
Along with the completion of the *Flora of China*
project, the research and conservation upon Chinese
plant diversity confront tremendous challenges and op-
portunities at the present time ?C the post-ora era.
This symposium aims at providing an opportunity
for plant taxonomists and systematists to review the
progress, evaluate the current status, and look into the
future of the eld. China hosts enormous plant diver-
sity that has supported its long history and continuous
advancement in studying plant taxonomy. With espe-
cially rapid progress made during the recent years, the
year 2013 comes to be the time for China to invite col-
leagues from the world to discuss the new frontiers of
plant diversity and taxonomy. This would provide an
ideal forum for Chinese and international botanists to
present research results, exchange ideas, discuss com-
mon interests, develop collaborations and move the eld
of plant diversity research forward.
*Theme and Topics*
1) Plant diversity in China
2) Plant diversity Conservation
3) Plant taxonomy in the post-ora era

Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the Third Meeting of the
Network for Neotropical Biogeography (NNB3) that
will take place at the Universidad de los Andes in Bo-
got a, Colombia, on January 7{10, 2014. The theme of
the meeting will be ^ aSpace, Time, Form and Genes.'
The event includes pre-meeting workshops (Jan. 7{8)
and optional post-meeting eld trips to unique Colom-
bian habitats.
Please visit the conference website http://-

The Network for Neotropical Biogeography (http:/-
/nnb.myspecies.info <http://nnb.myspecies.info/ >)
promotes scientic interactions across disciplines and
taxa with the following goals: - Promote scientic in-
teraction - Stimulate the exchange of material, students
and researchers - Increase inter-disciplinarity between
dierent elds - Discuss and plan joint projects and
grant applications - Stimulate collaborative eldwork
and reciprocal help with eld collection of research ma-
terial - Inform on upcoming events, recent papers and
other relevant material
The NNB was established during a symposium at
the BioSystematics conference in Berlin in February
2011. A second meeting, with the theme ^ aIntegrating
Neotropical Research,' was held at the Montgomery
Botanical Center, Coral Gables, Miami, Florida, USA,
on January 14th, 2013 immediately following the 6th
Biennial meeting of the International Biogeography So-ciety.
Tropical America - the Neotropics - is the most species-
rich region on Earth. Understanding the mechanisms
underlying the historical assembly and evolution of
this extreme biodiversity constitutes a major challenge
in biology, and will require hitherto unrealized inter-
disciplinary scientic collaboration.

Dear All, We invite you to consider submitting ab-
stracts to a session on connectivity in marine popu-
lations at the upcoming 2014 Ocean Sciences Meeting
in Honolulu. This session is meant to bring together re-
searchers working on a range of dierent organisms and
using various methods to examine connectivity among
populations in marine habitats. Abstract submission
deadline is Oct 4 (http://www.sgmeet.com/osm2014/-
default.asp), more info below.
032 - Examining connectivity in marine populations,
from unicells to metazoans, using novel and integrated
approaches
Connectivity among populations inuences their demo-
graphics, genetic structure and response to environmen-
tal change. Despite the ecological and evolutionary im-
portance of connectivity among populations, our under-
standing remains limited, in part due to the diculty
of measuring connectivity in marine habitats. New
tools for studying connectivity are emerging, including
compound-specic stable isotope analyses, advances in
geo-location, highly-variable genetic markers, popula-
tion genomic techniques and coupled bio-physical dis-
persal models. As measurements of connectivity be-
come more sophisticated, there is a greater need for
integration of techniques in order to deepen our un-
derstanding of the ecological and evolutionary conse-
quences of connectivity. This session focuses on new
insights that have been gained from integrating multi-
ple approaches, the development of new techniques to
quantify rates of dispersal and exchange among pop-
ulations, and attempts to identify unifying themes of
connectivity and gene ow across taxa. The session
will address taxa ranging from bacteria to whales, and
include a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We
encourage submissions that communicate results from
empirical, modeling, or integrative studies to a broad
audience and that describe basic research or its appli-
cation to support sustainability of exploited resources.

Applications for symposium conveners open for
ICBB2014.
In about one year (August 11-14, 2014) the In-
ternational Conference on the Biology of Butteries
(ICBB2014) will take place in Turku, Finland. The
conference will be organized into 12 symposia, of which
four will be arranged by the organizing committee, un-
der the broad themes 'Population biology and conserva-
tion', 'Genomics and development', 'Ecology and evolu-
tion' and 'Systematics and diversication'. These four
symposia are planned to be very general and to inform
all attendees of the latest trends in their respective ar-
eas. They will take place during the mornings and there
will be no parallel sessions during that time.
The afternoons will have two parallel sessions and will
be more specic. We invite proposals for themes and
conveners of the 8 afternoon symposia. Each sympo-
sium will consist of a 40 minute slot for a keynote
speaker plus 6 or 9 (depending on the day) 20 minute
slots for normal presentations. Applications should be
no longer than 2 A4 pages and should describe the
theme, why it is important and include suggestions of
potential speakers including the key note speaker (with
no obligation by suggested people to actually accept an
invitation, should the application be accepted). Con-
veners should leave four or ve 20 minute slots open for
contributed talks.
Applications and/or questions should be sent to
niklas.wahlberg@utu. by September 15, 2013. Appli-
cations will be reviewed by the organizing committee
and decisions will be made by October 15, 2013.More information about the conference can be found

*DEADLINE approaching: September 30*
Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to announce the program Evolution
of Drug Resistance to be held at the Kavli Institute
for Theoretical Physics at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, during the period July 21 - September
19, 2014, and to alert you that applications are now be-
ing accepted. We also encourage you to inform others
who you think might be interested in applying.
A summary and the latest information about
the program can be found online at: http:/-
/www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/dbdetails?acro=-
3D3Dsuperbugs14. Note the Application Deadline is
September 30, 2013.
KITP programs dier from many conferences and work-
shops in that they create a situation where scientists
learn from each other and actually do substantive re-
search, often collaborating with other participants. To
foster these interactions, KITP strongly encourages
theorists to stay for as long as possible, with three weeks
being the minimum stay for a regular participant. We
understand, however, that bench scientists with labo-
ratory responsibilities often cannot manage long visits
but can have a big impact even in a week, so we can be
more exible for them.12 EvolDir October 1, 2013
Some level of nancial support will be available, the
amount depending on the needs of the participants and
availability of funds. Supplementary funds are avail-
able to help support families wishing to make extended
visits. To apply, go to the aforementioned web page,
and click on the Apply link. Late applications will be
considered as budget and space permits. Due to space
and nancial constraints, however, we may not be able
to accommodate everyone who applies.
KITP provides oce and computing facilities on-site at
UC Santa Barbara and also provides help nding living
accommodations. It is necessary for every prospective
participant to set up an account and apply online, even
if we have already corresponded with you about the
program. Actual commitments of oce space and -
nancial support can be made only by written formal
invitations from the KITP Director, Lars Bildsten, re-
gardless of any communications you may have had with
us.
If you think you might like to participate, it will help
us with our planning if you could apply early, including
your proposed length of stay and any nancial require-
ments. If you have any questions, please contact one of
the coordinators.

*4 year PhD scholarship in Computational Phyloge-
nomics*
We seek a highly motivated computational or evolu-
tionary biologist to undertake a 4 year PhD, jointly
supervised by Craig Moritz at the Australian National
University and Alexei Drummond at the University of
Auckland.
The capacity to generate sequence data at 100's to
1000's of loci and across populations to entire clades
provides the opportunity to dramatically improve dis-
covery of species, estimation of their relationships and
understanding of micro- and macro-evolutionary pro-
cesses. But to fully exploit these rich data we need
to develop improved and new methods in population-
and phylo-genomic inference. Building on the BEAST2
platform, the student will develop and apply software
for species delimitation, species-tree estimation and
phylogeographic inference that makes eective use of
large-scale, multilocus sequence data. The student will
have access to a range of such datasets from the Moritz
lab, and opportunity to develop these if desired.
A scholarship of $27,500 p.a., funded by the Australian
Research Council is available for 4 years, commencing
on January 1st 2014. A 1st class BSc(Hons) or MSc
are required, as is a strong background in evolution-
ary or computational science with some level of train-
ing in both. Applications are welcome from persons ofany nationality. The student would be enrolled for a
PhD in the Division of Evolution, Ecology & Genet-
ics, Research School of Biology, ANU (rsb.anu.edu.au),
and with the possibility of formal aliation with Univ.
Auckland. For further details or to send applications,
please contact Craig Moritz (craig.moritz@anu.edu.au).
Review of applications will commence on November 1st,
2013.

duced by the main model species M. lignano, what these
proteins do, and how seminal uid proteins vary within
and between species.
The positions are oered as part of a DFG-funded
research project, providing for salary for up to 3

ternational team of scientists, and the working language
of the Department is English. The project will further
benet from the involvement of international coopera-
tion partners in Switzerland, Austria and The Nether-
lands.
If you have a strong background (including an M.Sc. or
equivalent) in evolutionary biology or a related eld and
feel that you would be well suited to the project, please

people/faculty/buston/) and the Webb Lab in the
Department of Biology at Colorado State Uni-
versity (http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/ctwebb/-

to work on the NSF funded project \An Integra-
tive Investigation of Population Connectivity Using a
Coral Reef Fish" (http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID=1260424).
The aim of the project is to come to a better under-
standing of the patterns, causes and consequences of
marine larval dispersal and population connectivity, so
that we can improve reserve design and sheries man-
agement. We use the neon goby Elacatinus lori, which
lives on the Belizean Barrier Reef, as a tractable model
system. The overall project integrates genetic, ecolog-
ical, behavioral and oceanographic data, with model-
ing simulations and statistical analyses. The student
project will likely involve the development of evolution-
ary ecology models that use data on larval dispersal to
predict patterns of spatial genetic structure.
Ideally, prospective students will have strong interests
in ecology and evolution with additional quantitative
background (e.g., mathematics and statistics) and ma-
rine background (e.g., eldwork and SCUBA). Realis-
tically, we expect to provide quantitative and / or ma-
rine eldwork training. The prospective student may be
based in either Boston or Fort Collins, but will spend
time at both institutions and at the eld site in Belize.

?Psyllid-microbial associations: modern-day risk of
primitive true bugs?
PROJECT:
The recent establishment of the tomato potato psyllid
(TPP), Bactericera cockerelli, and its vectoring of the
newly discovered non-culturable bacterium Candidatus
Liberibacter solanacearum, has had a huge negative im-
pact on the New Zealand horticultural industry. This
now represents an imminent threat to the Australia and
adds to that from the Asian citrus (Diaphorina citri)
and eggplant (Acizzia solanicola) psyllids.
Understanding what psyllid/microbial associations are
already in New Zealand and Australia, and developing
the technologies for the detection of new potentially
pathogenic associations, has now become a priority for
biosecurity preparedness.
Field collections of psyllids in both New Zealand and
Australia will be made. These, together with other
specimens or data, will be used to construct a molecular
phylogenetic scaold upon which the microbes found,
through next generation sequencing, to be linked with
those psyllids can be superimposed.
Hypotheses as to the risk to plant health posed by
existing or new associations will be developed. The
data may also contribute to diagnostic methods for the
detection, identication and surveillance of the psyllid
vectors as well as potential causative agents of disease.
APPLICANTS:
We are seeking a highly motivated student to develop
skills in molecular phylogenetics and systematics that
will cross the disciplines of entomology and microbiol-
ogy.

November 30th 2013
The group \evolutionary genetics of shes" lead by Dr.
Arne W. Nolte at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-20 EvolDir October 1, 2013
tionary Biology in Pl on, Germany, is oering two PhD
positions that are funded within the framework of the
ERC starting grant \EVOLMAPPING". The goal of
this project is to analyze evolutionary change in inva-
sive Cottus, a lineage of sh that represents an exam-
ple for the early steps of hybrid speciation. We will
combine analyses of gene expression, genetic mapping
and screens for genotypic selection in laboratory popu-
lations and wild sh to identify the links between geno-
typic and phenotypic evolution to infer the evolution-
ary impact of natural hybridization. PhD candidates
should begin their work in spring 2014 and summer
2014 respectively. The salary of the PhD candidates
will be according to the standard German pay scale in-
cluding all social benets (TV oD E13/2 salary).
One PhD project to commence in spring 2014 will focus
on the inference of genome wide patterns of selection in
the evolving gene pool of invasive Cottus to identify ge-
nomic traits that play a key role in adaptive evolution
and the invasion of new habitats. The task of the stu-
dent will be to study genome evolution in hybrid sh
using various approaches as for example through anal-
ysis of the size of ancestral genomic blocks and gene
copy number variation. The analyses will be based on
Next-Generation sequencing data and use conventional
genotyping to validate results. The candidate should
be interested in population genetics and computational
biology as it is part of the work plan to develop and
extend the analysis of genomic sequence data.
The second PhD project to commence in summer 2014
will focus on the evolution of patterns of gene expres-
sion in invasive Cottus. The central objective of this
project is to study gene expression in the lab and in
nature, and to identify phenotypic plasticity and evo-
lutionary novelty in invasive Cottus. The development
of an inclusive microarray and the analysis of gene ex-
pression will be based on a wealth of transcriptome and
genome sequences that facilitate a very inclusive devel-
opment of a state of the art microarray. This project
is adequate for a candidate who is talented in working
with live animals and able to do short experiments in
the eld.
We oer an English speaking and ambitious working en-
vironment at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on, Germany. The Institutes main elds
of work include evolutionary ecology (Prof. Dr. M.

Graduate Student Assistantship in Comparative Ge-
nomics
I am seeking potential graduate students (M.S. or
Ph.D.) interested in studying comparative genomics of
amoeboid protists.
Our lab is broadly interested in the evolution of social-
ity in microbes. We are developing model systems to
look at the commonalities among the greatest examples
of convergent evolution known to date. We have dis-
covered that a great diversity of single celled eukaryotic
microbes (AKA protists) are capable of working with
one another to form a complex body made of thou-
sands of individual cells. This is one of the simplest
and most striking examples of emergent behavior. In
many cases, this behavior is sacricial where some of
the cells that become part of the multicellular body die
for the 'greater good' of others. To examine the com-
monalities amongst the various social protists, we are
taking a multi-pronged approach using comparative ge-
nomics and developmental transcriptomics to elucidate
the genetic basis of sociality.
Our lab is also interested in examining the deep evo-
lution of eukaryotic lineages. We are using novel ap-
proaches in phylogenomics to examine how the various
major groups of eukaryotes evolved over the course of
the last 2 billon years. We are currently focused on the
evolutionary histories of amoeboid organisms.
Funding for students initially would be provided
through teaching assistantships within the department,
but potential exists for research assistantship fund-
ing in the future. I will also provide a summer
salary. Information on Graduate Studies in the De-
partment of Biological Sciences is available at http:/-

sippi State University Department of Biological Sci-

NSF-IGERT Genetic Engineering and Society: The
case of transgenic pests. We are looking for one
or two students interested in applying the tools of
evolutionary biology to important global challenges.
Genetic pest management involves the manipulation
of pest populations to suppress transmission of dis-
eases like malaria, and to decrease densities of agri-
cultural pests. Evolutionary biology has an impor-
tant role for informing the design of the selsh genetic
elements that drive transgenes into the pest popula-

http://geneticengsoc.ncsu.edu/ Questions about ge-
netic pest management are technical and scientic, but
also deeply social. We believe students must acquire
both an understanding of the technologies underpin-
ning genetic pest management as well as an understand-
ing of the social context in which those tools might be
used. Because no single student can master all these
complexities, our goal is to sponsor an academically
and culturally diverse group of about six students in
Fall 2014. With roughly equal representation of stu-
dents seeking degrees in humanities/social sciences and
mathematics/natural sciences, IGERT fellows in Ge-

PolychaeteEvolution
A PhD scholarship is available for a student within the
project \Developmental plasticity in the polychaete Py-
gospio elegans and its genetic basis".
GESS - the Graduate Programme in Environmental
Stress Studies, within the Department of Environmen-
tal, Social and Spatial Change (ENSPAC), Roskilde
University (RUC) Denmark and The Graduate Pro-
gramme of the Department of Biological and Environ-
mental Science, University of Jyvaskyla (JYU) Finland
- are oering a 3.5 year scholarship for a double-degree
student. The student will spend approximately half of
the total study period at each institution and complete
requirements as outlined in a cotutelle agreement. The
position shall be lled November -December 2013. The
student will be co-supervised by Benni Winding Hansen
and Gary T. Banta (RUC) and K. Emily Knott (JYU).
The research project will aim to determine the extent
of developmental plasticity in natural populations, test
possible environmental triggers of plasticity and com-
pare the expression of relevant genes during develop-
ment in the estuarine polychaete Pygospio elegans. In
this study the research groups integrate studies in ma-
rine benthic ecology, experimental ecology, and molecu-
lar and developmental genetics to understand polymor-
phism in larval development in the polychaete worm24 EvolDir October 1, 2013
Pygospio elegans. This species inhabits a wide range
of habitats and is one of the few marine species ca-
pable of producing multiple types of larvae that dier
in morphology and potential for dispersal. Such poly-
morphism may represent developmental plasticity, with
dierent outcomes triggered by specic environmental
variables and may also have a genetic basis. Our re-
search uses P. elegans as a model for deciphering the
mechanisms of the evolution of larvae and development.
The following lists examples of tasks and questions that
will be addressed in the PhD research: 1. Surveying
population dynamics and maybe also the larval devel-
opment of P. elegans from sites in Roskilde Fjord and
Isefjord in Denmark, and recording environmental vari-
ation at these sites. 2. Testing the role of salinity
and density as cues for plasticity in development. 3.
Comparing expression of relevant developmental genes
in larvae from experimental treatments and/or culture.
4. Identifying possible signs of selection or epigenetic
marks in DNA sequences of developmental genes.
The successful candidate should have a background
in the natural sciences preferentially with experience
in benthic marine ecology and/or population genetics.
Experience with experimental biology or physiology, in-
tegrative and comparative biology, molecular biology
and bioinformatics will be considered an advantage.
Furthermore, it is recommended that the candidate has
good communication skills, commitment to scientic re-
search, and motivation for completing the doctorate in
a double degree framework, at two institutions. The
proposed project will have a strong experimental di-
mension which will be aliated to the ENSPAC exper-
imental plankton group led by Professor Benni Winding
Hansen and Environmental Risk group lead by Asso-
ciate Professor Gary T. Banta. A genetic component
to the project is required and will be aliated with
group led by Academy Researcher Emily Knott at the
University of Jyvaskyla. The Ph.D. scholarship requires
that the candidate rstly spend 1.5 years in Denmark
(RUC) and thereafter 2 years in Finland (JYU). The
candidate will defend the Ph.D. at both institutions.
The successful candidate will be enrolled while in Den-
mark in the Graduate Programme in Environmental
Stress Studies (GESS) in accordance with the rules
issued by the Ministry of Technology and Science
and additional regulations issued by Roskilde Univer-
sity (RUC), and will be employed in accordance with
the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and
AC (the Danish confederation of Professional Associ-
ations). Candidates receiving GESS scholarships are
automatically registered in the school. They are ex-
pected to participate actively in relevant courses, sem-
inars and other activities arranged by GESS. While inFinland, the successful candidate will be enrolled in the
Graduate Programme in the Department of Biological
and Environmental Science at University of Jyvaskyla,
according to regulations set out in a cotutelle agree-
ment between JYU and RUC. They are expected to
participate actively in relevant courses, seminars and
other activities arranged by the graduate programme.
Salary is dened at local levels and may dier between
RUC and JYU. Research expenses are covered by the
project.
To apply, please prepare the following: * Your Curricu-
lum vitae * A research plan or project description of
2-4 pages (The applicant is not requested to submit a

Graduate Students in Host/Parasite Evolution
The Reed Lab (University of Florida) is seeking gradu-

mammals/). These students would matriculate through
the Department of Biology (www.biology.u.edu) and
reside in my lab at The Florida Museum of Natural
History (www.mnh.u.edu).
Insect/endosymbiont Genomics (http:/-
/www.mnh.u.edu/mammals/-
louse endosymbiont genomics.htm): Many insects
feed on diets that are nutritionally incomplete. The
parasitic lice that feed on mammalian blood require
endosymbiotic bacteria to provide nutrients missing
in the louse's diet. Most insects have endosymbionts
that have lived in association with them for many
millions of years. Lice, however, seem to be replacing
their endosymbionts every 10 million years or so.
Therefore, many closely related lice have distantly
related endosymbionts. We are studying the incredible
genome reduction that occurs independently in these
endosymbionts to better understand the process of
endosymbiosis.
Human Evolution from a Lousy Perspec-
tive (http://www.mnh.u.edu/mammals/-
human louse evolution.htm): Human evolution isOctober 1, 2013 EvolDir 27
studied from various types of data from fossils to
molecules. In our lab we study the molecular genetics
of a host-specic human parasite, lice, which have
been tracking human evolutionary history for millions
of years. By studying worldwide populations of lice
using genetic and genomic tools we've been able
to estimate when humans began wearing clothing.
From our current genome studies we are investigating
divergences among living lice that vastly predate
divergences within their modern human hosts. These
ancient divergences within lice were likely caused by
close contact between modern and archaic hominids
during periods of overlap. Our current and future
studies will be looking at human migration patterns
through fast-evolving markers in the lice.
Caribbean Bat Biodiversity (http:/-

also been investigating the eects of climate change
on populations and species of bats in the Caribbean.
These studies are looking at the degree to which past
sea level change fractured and reconnected popula-

AvianColourPolymorphisms
The Animal Ecology Group of the University of Gronin-
gen and the Max Planck Institute of Ornithology are
looking for a candidate to obtain funding for the fol-
lowing PhD-project:
Buzzard colour polymorphisms in space and time
Colour polymorphisms are common in raptor species.
Since these morphs have a heritable basis, an impor-
tant biological question is how this variation is main-
tained over evolutionary time. Frequency dependent
selection pressures are expected, but few empirical ex-
amples from this exist in nature. Additionally, perfor-
mance of morphs depends on habitat characteristics,
and may vary over time. Little is known about poten-
tial long-term changes and spatial variation in morph
frequencies, and how these relate to variation in tness.
Past research has illuminated a heterozygous advan-
tage, but this may be population-specic, and fails to
explain spatial variation in the distribution of morph
types. In this project we aim at describing patterns of
spatial and temporal variation in the colour morphs of

*/Evolutionary genetics of dietary adaptations in
bats/*
*/ERC-funded PhD { start date in 2014/*
*/Deadline 1 ^st November 2013/*
/I am seeking a highly motivated student to undertake
a PhD on the evolution and genetic basis of dietary
adaptations in bats./
Bats are emerging as important mammalian model
organisms for understanding adaptation and develop-
ment; they possess the smallest genomes of any mam-
mals and exhibit numerous unique evolutionary inno-
vations among mammals including powered ight, la-
ryngeal echolocation, and diets such as blood (san-
guinivory) and nectar (nectarivory). These traits are
strongly implicated in the adaptive radiation and global
success of bats, which number over 1200 species.
This PhD will focus on identifying the molecular adap-
tations that have contributed to the unparalleled di-
etary diversication of bats. The project will combine
laboratory work and bioinformatics, and so experience
in one or both of these (and a willingness to learn) is
essential. There will also be opportunities to conduct
eldwork. The student will also need to be able to work
independently at times, as well as part of a team.

2 PhD positions in forest tree responses to climate
change
University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sci-
ence Appalachian Laboratory, Frostburg, MD
Applications are invited for two NSF-funded PhD stu-
dent assistantships at the University of Maryland Cen-
ter for Environmental Science, Appalachian Laboratory
(AL). We are seeking self-motivated students interested
in working on tree responses to climate change using (1)
macroecological modeling and remote sensing (Position
1), and (2) ecological genomics (Position 2). Students
will join an interactive and growing team of ecologists
and geneticists at AL working on understanding the
responses of forest trees to climate variability.
Position 1: Macroecological modeling and remote sens-
ing The main project for this student is to combine
macroecological approaches and remote sensing to link
intraspecic variation (genetic composition, phenology,
functional traits, etc) and environmental gradients at
geographic scales, with an emphasis on understanding
the response of forest trees to climate change. The
student will help extend existing approaches in dis-
tribution modeling (e.g., species distribution models,
community-level models) to model and map intraspe-
cic variation at regional to continental scales and
identify the geographic regions containing populations
pre/mal-adapted to future climate change. Within this
framework, there are numerous opportunities for a stu-
dent to extend the broader project objectives. This is
an ideal project for an individual interested in macroe-
cology, remote sensing, and species distribution model-
ing. Candidates should have some experience with GIS
and statistical analyses implemented in R.
Position 2: Ecological genomics The focus of this stu-
dent will be identifying the genomic basis of ecologically
important traits involved in adaptation of forest trees to
climate, especially along the southern range edge wheregrowing seasons are early and long. This project will in-
volve integrating next-generation sequencing with phys-
iological traits and climate data to search for genotype-
phenotype and genotype-environment associations in-
dicative of local adaptation. This is an ideal position for
students excited about using the latest genomic tech-
niques to study fundamental issues in local adaptation,
environmental change, and the eects of range limits.
Previous experience in population genetics, plant ecol-
ogy, and solid computer skills are required. Some pro-
gramming experience (Perl, R) is a plus.
Both positions are based at the Appalachian Labora-
tory in Frostburg, Maryland, working with Drs. Matt
Fitzpatrick (macroecology) and Andrew Elmore (re-
mote sensing), and Stephen Keller (genomics). The
positions come with a highly competitive stipend and
benets package, including 3 years of support on a re-
search assistantship, with additional support available
from teaching assistantships. Students will matriculate
through the Marine, Estuarine, and Environmental Sci-
ences Program (MEES) at the University of Maryland,
College Park and will reside at the Appalachian Lab-
oratory in Frostburg for the duration of the project.
Frostburg is a small college town in the mountains of
western Maryland, providing abundant outdoor recre-
ation opportunities.
For more information, contact Matt Fitz-
patrick (mtzpatrick@umces.edu) or Steve Keller
(skeller@umces.edu). To apply, please email as a
single pdf document: (1) a statement of interest, (2)
a CV, and (3) contact information for three referees
to tree grad@al.umces.edu. Please indicate in your
subject line \macroecology" or \genomics" to indicate
the position of interest. Review of applications will
begin November 1, 2013 and will continue until suitable
candidates are found, with starting dates available as
soon as January 2014 and no later than Fall semester
2014.

sity: Orchid population viability and life history varia-
tion (UFV-PA 2013/2289)
http://www.uu.se/jobb/?languageId=3D1 (see at-
tached add)
Starting date: 1 Nov 2013 (or as agreed).
In this project we combine long-term demographic
monitoring in natural and managed eld populations
with experimental approaches targeted at the most un-
certain life cycle transitions in orchid populations (ger-
mination and dormancy). The long-term goal is to
produce knowledge that will underpin management de-
cisions and future conservation strategies for several
declining and threatened species. This includes both
ecological (population viability) and evolutionary (life-
time selection on life history traits) population trajec-
tories. The project is a collaboration between Uppsala
University and the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology (NTNU).
The candidate will link existing demographic data with
new eld experiments. Specic approaches will in-
clude 1) comparative demographic analyses to evalu-
ate whether eects of climate and land-use change aresimilar across species and sites, 2) eld experiments
inducing variation in reproductive eort to determine
the shape of the cost of reproduction function in sev-
eral species, and 3) population modelling linking tness
components to life-time tness, to examine population
viability and selection on life history in relation to land-
use and climate.
Candidates require a master degree in ecology, and
should have a keen interest in plant population ecology
and evolutionary ecology. Experience with ecological
eld experiments, statistical analyses and demographic
population modelling (in particular using matrix or in-
tegral projection models in R) are considered merits.
Prociency in English is a requirement.
The application should include a letter of motivation for
PhD studies and for this topic in particular, as well as
a description of previous education, research interests
and experience. It should further include a CV, au-
thorized copies of degrees and transcripts of academic
records, and contact information (e-mail and phone) for
at least two references. MSc thesis and other relevant
publications should be enclosed.
The postgraduate training comprises four years of
full time studies. The successful candidate will re-
ceive a postgraduate position (currently 23100-27500
SEK/month). The position can be combined with up
to 20% of teaching assistantship, which will then pro-
long the position accordingly.

Bioinformatics and Quantitative Genetics Researchers
The Buckler Lab at the Institute for Genomic Diver-
sity, Cornell University is beginning two exciting new
projects to identify the deleterious mutations in func-
tional domains of the maize and cassava genomes, and
then build models to predict performance based on
these deleterious polymorphisms. We are looking to
hire three researchers with a background in machine
learning, bioinformatics of genomic data, and/or statis-
tical genetics. Strong skills in computer programming
are necessary.
Maize has a long been established as a premier system
for studying quantitative and statistical genetics, and
our group is now using it as a model for the study of
the impact of rare alleles and genetic load in maize. We
are creating models that bridge genomics with quan-
titative genetics. We are asking similar questions in
cassava. Cassava is one of the most important crops
to subsistence in the world, yet until recently very lit-
tle genomics was applied to improving the crop. The
cassava project is in collaboration with a large genomic-
assisted breeding eort to take genomic ndings to the
eld. This project has an exciting potential of further-
ing basic science and applying it quickly to agriculture
for the developing world.

The Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research
(IZW) in Berlin is Germany's premier wildlife research
institute. The IZW focuses on the life histories and
mechanisms of evolutionary adaptations of mammals
and birds, their limits and their conservation in nat-
ural and anthropogenically inuenced environments.
For the new interdisciplinary Junior Research Group,46 EvolDir October 1, 2013
funded through the Federal Ministry of Education and
Research (BMBF), on \Species resilience to global
change: Assessing the impact of sustainable forest man-
agement schemes on biodiversity" the IZW, together
with its partner, the Centre of GeoGenetics (Prof. Dr.
Tom Gilbert) of the University of Copenhagen, is look-
ing for a: Laboratory Technician (Technical Assistant
TA) (f/m) Reference 15/2013
Project This Junior Research Group uses a multidis-
ciplinary combination of state of the art in-situ eld
research (camera-trapping and leech screening for host
and pathogen DNA), novel molecular tools, advanced
computational simulations and modelling, and high-
resolution satellite images to investigate the highly
threatened mammal community of Southeast Asia and
its associated pathogens. Laboratory work will fo-
cus on the screening of terrestrial leeches collected in
Southeast Asia. Leech screening is ideally suited to
study ground-dwelling mammals and thus complements
camera-trapping to assess mammal species richness.
Furthermore this technique allows to distinguish indi-
vidual animals, and to assess the genetic diversity that
is usually neglected in biodiversity monitoring. Anal-
ysis of pathogen DNA from host blood will also allow
health monitoring across a variety of species, reveal-
ing the consequences of dierent forest management
schemes for wildlife health. Species and individual iden-
tication of hosts and the search for host pathogens de-
rived from the leeches will be performed using molecular
capture methods combined with second generation se-
quencing on IonTorrent PGM and Illumina MiSeq plat-
forms.
Prerequisites . Successful completion of an appren-
ticeship, preferably as a biological laboratory techni-
cian or assistant (BTA; MTA); . Strong molecular
biology skills; . Preferably, experience working with
small quantities of DNA (i.e. degraded DNA obtained
from ancient samples or faecal samples); . Experience
with next generation sequencing; . Basic bioinformatics
knowledge (primer design, blast, alignments etc.) is re-
quired and experience with next generation sequencing
data analysis is advantageous; . Prociency in English
(especially oral as we have an international research
team).
We oer state-of-the-art methodology and a stimulat-
ing international research environment in an interdis-

edenrcn@fas.harvard.eduGeneticMarker companies
Dear EvolDir,
I am planning to have primers developed from a com-
mercial/university lab. Specically, I'm looking for
about 10 microsatellites for one mammal species. I've
received quotes from *Savannah River Ecology Lab
(USA), Genetic Marker Services (England), Allgenetics
(Spain), *and* Armalil (USA)*. The prices and level
of services oered are similar, with the exception of Ge-
netic Marker Services which uses a cloning method and
is cheaper.
Before I make a nal decision, I wanted to ask: does
anyone else have any experience with these companies?
If so, are they reliable in terms of product quality, time-
line, etc.? Any feedback is appreciated!
Thanks!

Parrots DNA samples
Dear members,
I'm starting a research involving molecular genetics of
parrots. However, I'm not sure about the best way of
preserving the biological samples and, also, witch is the
best biological sample to collect. Since the animals will
be trapped and released, I was thinking about using
blood samples and collect them with vacutainer tubes.
In this case, is there any dierence about using heparin
or EDTA as anticoagulant? Can I store this material
in -20 degree freezer? How long do the tubes can be
stored? I also thought about collecting feathers. But
I'm not sure about the best way for proceeding with
DNA isolation in this case.
I'll appreciate any help.
Thanks in advance.

Polyrhachis ant samples
Dear Colleagues,
As a postdoc in Dr. Corrie Moreau's lab at the Field
Museum of Natural History in Chicago, IL, USA, I
study the phylogeny, evolution and biogeography of the
spiny ant genus Polyrhachis with molecular methods. I
will especially focus on the following questions: How are
the subgenera related to each other? What is the bio-
geographic history and potential origin of the genus?
What are the patterns of morphological evolution in
this diverse genus?
To answer these questions samples of as many
Polyrhachis species as possible from various parts of
their distribuition range from Africa to Souteast Asia
and Australia are necessary.
As these are are large ants only a few worker ants of
each Polyrhachis collection are necessary and will be
helpful for this study.
If you have any Polyrhachis specimens, and you would
be willing to donate some for my project, please email
me. Any and all samples, regardless of the preservation
method, would be greatly appreciated. However, if you
will go collecting in the future and have a chance to col-
lect spiny ants that you would be willing to contribute,
preservation in >95% ethanol would be the best. Please
feel free to contact me or Corrie Moreau with questions.
Cheers, Dirk Mezger dmezger@eldmuseum.org

RohlfMedal Morphometrics
Award of 2013 Rohlf Medal for Excellence in Morpho-
metrics
On October 24th, the Rohlf Medal will be awarded at
Stony Brook University to Prof. Paul O'Higgins. Prof.
O'Higgins is the Chair of Anatomy at the University
of York and head of the Centre for Anatomical and
Human Sciences, Hull York Medical School, England.
The Rohlf Medal is awarded every two years and was
established in 2006 by the family and friends of Distin-
guished Prof. F. James Rohlf, Stony Brook University,
to recognize excellence in the development of morpho-
metric methods and their application to shape analysis
in the biomedical sciences.
This award recognizes Prof. O'Higgins' contributions
to paleoanthropology through his long-standing inter-
est in the quantication of biological form to investigate
animal function and evolution. He has been an inno-
vator in methods that merge cutting-edge technologies
of imaging and biomechanics with statistical methods
of shape analysis. He is currently exploring the use
of computed tomography and bioimaging to investi-
gate the eects of stress on the shape of anatomical
structures. His empirical research explores links be-
tween variation in skeletal structure, evolutionary his-
tory, function, and development. Prof. O'Higgins has
also devoted considerable eort to developing software
that makes these approaches accessible to other inves-
tigators. Throughout his career, he has trained numer-
ous scholars in quantitative morphology, including the
latest morphometric approaches.
The Rohlf Medal will be awarded at a lecture given by
Prof. O'Higgins at 4:00 pm on October 24th in Lecture
Hall 2 in the Wang Center at Stony Brook University.
The title of his lecture is \The Measure of Things: Pat-
tern, Process and Morphometry." The lecture is part of
the Provost Lecture Series at Stony Brook University
and is co-sponsored by the Rohlf Medal Fund and the
Department of Ecology and Evolution.

bell@life.bio.sunysb.eduSIMMAP question
Dear EvolDir users,
I need some help from people who have some experi-
ence with a program called SIMMAP. I have two ques-
tions. We want to use SIMMAP to estimate ancestral
sequences.
1.) I am currently supervising a Bachelor degree the-
sis in biomathematics. My student was supposed to
write a program using the output of SIMMAP for some
further analyses. She successfully wrote that program
(we tested it with some SIMMAP test les) and now
wants to analyze some real data which were given to
us by a biology professor. So the thing is that she
needs the SIMMAP output before she can apply her
own program. However, we now struggle to generate
the XML le, which is needed before SIMMAP can
even be started. Here is the problem as my student
explained it to me:
The student tried to create the xml-le with a MrBayes
output. Nex2Xml failed to create the xml-le and we
are not quite sure what the cause of this is, as the
FAQ states that MrBayes output is just what Nex2Xml
wants.
The thing is that NOTHING happened. So rst we
thought that the les are too big and that maybe it
would take some time until the XML le would be gen-
erated. After 20 minutes we stopped the process and
tried something else: We deleted all trees in the tree le
except for one (and did the same thing for the param-
eter le accordingly). It still did not work. We were
not sure if the program was still doing something or
not, we double checked and saw that no le had been
generated.
However, if we run everything identically but leave
away the parameter le, everything works as supposed
- we get a nice XML le and everything is ne. First I
really thought that maybe the parameter le is too big,
but after we shortened it to the 1-tree-case, this cannot
be the case. So we do not know how to proceed, which
means my student currently cannot nish her thesis.
We need to consider the parameters, too, otherwise our
analysis does not make any sense.
2.) Furthermore it would be interesting to know if it
is possible to insert two les as a treele as the biolo-
gist has actually performed two runs with MrBayes and84 EvolDir October 1, 2013
wants both analyzed simultaneously.
Any help would be appreciated as this delay is really
bothering my student.
Kind regards, Mareike Fischer (Greifswald University,
Germany)

Software DAMBE update
Dear Colleagues,
I have just uploaded a new version of DAMBE. It added
two functions requested by users and xed a bug in us-
ing your own codon table of highly expressed genes forcomputing CAI.
1. Print big trees over many pages. Originally, DAMBE
has a function to break a tree into grids with each grid
corresponding to one regular page. It has two prob-
lems. First, it is quite dicult to trim the edges of
each page and piece them together into a big tree. Sec-
ond, it does not allow one to print to PDF format so
that one can see what the individual pages look like be-
fore sending to printer. The new function will simply
limit the tree width to one page so one only needs to
stick the pages together vertically. Also, if the PDF
driver is already available in your computer, you can
choose to print to PDF. If you have produced a very
big tree from other programs and want to print in
DAMBE, simply copy the tree in Newick format and
click 'Phylogenetics jPaste tree in tree panel'.
2. I have implemented the CVTree method by Prof.
B. Hao and his colleagues in China (Nucl. Acids Res,
2009). I did this because the CVTree web server does
not seem to take any user les to perform an anal-
ysis and because the link to the standalone program
is broken, i.e.,I can't nd any functional CVTree soft-
ware available. The method is useful for species (es-
pecially for viruses) where a good set of aligned se-
quences is often dicult to obtain. The input is a
set of fasta les each containing protein sequences of
a species (e.g., the .faa les one can retrieve from
GenBank), e.g., EcoliK12.faa, BacillusSubtilis.faa, My-
coplasmaGenetalium.faa, etc. You put all these les
in one directory and click 'Phylogenetics jCVTree' to
browse to the directory containing these .faa les. Se-
lect them all and click 'Open'. A tree will be displayed
(You may click 'Tree jIgnore branch lengths' to get a
better view of the topology). It will take some time if
you include more than one h undred bacterial species
each with thousands of protein sequences. The sim-
ply way to start is to retrieve some viral .faa les from
GenBank to try out the function.
The method works surprisingly well. I retrieved the .faa
les from E. coli and a few related species, broke each
.faa les into rst half and the last half, named the re-
sulting le Sp1A.faa and Sp1B.faa, Sp2A.faa, Sp2B.faa,
and so on, and found the two halves got clustered to-
gether. The possible biological foundation for this is
that each species contain some unique ancient peptides
that are scattered throughout the protein sequences and
serve as the proteomic ngerprint of the species. This
is of course just my speculation. I will look into it when
I have time (I am NOT trying to stake out a territory.
Anyone is welcome to investigate the issue).
3. I have xed a bug in the function that allows a
user-generated codon usage table of highly expressedOctober 1, 2013 EvolDir 85
genes for computing CAI using DAMBE. You can use
DAMBE or any other program to generate a codon
usage table in text format that includes three essen-
tial columns: Codon, AA, and CodonFrequency. The
columns should have either no column header (i.e., 64
rows of codon frequency data start at the rst row) or
have the column headers in the rst row (i.e., 64 rows
of codon frequency data starts in the second row). The
simplest way to generate a codon usage table of highly
expressed genes is to use coding sequences for ribosomal
proteins (which are typically highly expressed.)
I have also xed a number of minor bugs. Please down-
load the new version at

Software R marmap
<apologies for cross-posting >
Dear listers,
We are happy to announce the release of marmap0.6, a
free and open-source R package for importing, plotting
and analyzing bathymetric and topographic data.
http://www.plosone.org/article/-
info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0073051
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/-
index.html One of the primary goal of the package is
to allow the production of publication-ready sampling
maps for ecologists, through easing automatic retrieval
of xyz data from the NOAA. Functions to query data
(bathymetry, sampling information) are available in-
teractively by clicking on marmap maps. Bathymetric
and topographic data can also be used to calculate
projected surface areas within specied depth/altitude
intervals, and constrain the calculation of realistic
shortest path distances. Such information can be used
in molecular ecology, for example, to evaluate genetic
isolation by distance in a spatially-explicit framework.
We are still working on adding functions to marmap, for
example to automatically space pie charts on maps, plot
EEZ, 12 nm limits, or ICES regions, and we welcomeideas on how to improve marmap (bugs, new functions,
etc)!

Software diveRsity
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to introduce the new R package and
web application, diveRsity, for general population ge-
netics analyses. While the package has been designed
with beginners to R programming in mind, it can also
be used through a web based interface thus removing
the need to use R at all. This new application is also
particularly useful for those who require the power and
exibility of a scripting language (e.g. during simula-
tion/approximate Bayesian computation studies).
|{ Population genetics analyses |{
Accepting the ubiquitous ^ agenepop' le format as in-
put, diveRsity allows users to calculate a plethora of
descriptive population genetics parameters such as:
1) Weir & Cockerham's (1984) Theta (locus, global &
pairwise, as well as 95% condence intervals for each)
2) Nei & Chesser's (1983) G fstg(locus, global & pair-
wise, as well as 95% condence intervals for each)
3) Hedrick's (2005) G' fstg(locus, global & pairwise,
as well as 95% condence intervals for each)
4) Jost's (2008) D (locus, global & pairwise, as well as
95% condence intervals for each)
5) Chi-square tests for sample heterogeneity
6) Basic population parameters such as HWE, observed
heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity and allelic rich-
ness (resample method).
7) Skrbinsek et al. (2012) standardized diversity ratios
(with simplied input using a single ^ agenepop' le)
8) Rosenberg et al. (2003) Locus informativeness for
the inference of ancestry (I fng)
One of the major benets of using diveRsity over sim-
ilar applications is the convenience of its simplied re-
sult output structure, as most functions in the package
calculate multiple statistics at once. For example, to
generate table 1, multiple software packages are typi-
cally required, while, with diveRsity, a single command86 EvolDir October 1, 2013
will write this exact table structure to an excel/text
le.
Table 1. Basic stats returned from diveRsity. N = num-
ber of individuals genotyped per locus per population
sample, A = number of alleles per locus per popula-
tion sample, % = percentage of total alleles per locus
per population sample, Ar = Allelic richness, Ho = ob-
served heterozygosity, He = expected heterozygosity,
HWE = p-value from chi-square test for goodness of t
to HWE

0.87 HWE 0 0.1604 0.9874 0.9841 0.9929
Another major strength of diveRsity, in comparison to
other similar packages, is that it is also capable of esti-
mating 95% condence intervals for the various param-
eters listed above. These condence intervals can be
calculated at locus, global and pairwise levels. Most
currently available software packages avoid calculat-
ing condence intervals, especially for pairwise com-
parisons, due to the intense computation required, and
instead, base the statistical signicance of results the
less informative and more problematic, p-value; diveR-
sity uses parallel computation to make the estimation
of 95% C.I. a relatively trivial task, especially on ma-
chines with many CPU cores.
There are also various useful data visualisation tools
for exploratory analysis available with the package, in-
cluding 'heat map' plots of large pairwise dierentiation
matrices, with optional 'tooltip' functionality for simple
exploration of genetic patterns among a large number
of population samples. A simple 'ad hoc' visual method
is also provided to assess the presence of locus polymor-
phism vs Ffstgissues, as discussed by Hedrick, (2005)
& Jost, (2008), among others.
|{ Microsatellite multiplex development |{ diveRsity
contains a function, ^ amicroPlexer', which allows users
to develop microsatellite multiplexes based on locus size
ranges and uorophore technology. The function is ca-
pable of creating ^ ahigh-density' or ^ abalanced-density'
multiplex groups, depending on experimental require-
ments. A stand-alone version of microplexer is availableat:
http://glimmer.rstudio.com/kkeenan/microPlexer/
Information on the use of microplexer can be found in
the package documentation (see below).

SouthAfrica Volunteers
SmallMammalEvolution
4 volunteers needed from January 2014 onwards
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to eco-physiology, animal behavior, evolution, and
ecology before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night in
winter, sometimes over 40 C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of
a small social group.October 1, 2013 EvolDir 87
Work of eld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood sam-
ples are collected for physiological measurements. Vol-
unteers are expected to help with maintenance of the
research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1300 (around 180 US$, 110 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$, 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for 4 volunteers starting in December 2013 or January
2014. Volunteers are expected to stay at least three
months, but longer periods of up to 6months are pre-
ferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

to post the answers which are shown below:

BioRad: C1000 TOUCH CYCLER (2) S1000 CYCLER
(4) Answers:
1) I purchased a Techne thermocycler two years ago
and it broke down twice already (I think is the block).
Their guaranty is great, you send it back and they x
it for free, but it is really annoying to have to send it
back every 10 months or so. I wouldn't go with them
again.
2) I don't have the Techne you have quoted but got a
cheaper one a couple of years ago after having MJs for
years. It was hard to program and not at all intuitive
to me. The students don't like to use it. We got a
C1000 BioRad this year - nice machine. I bought both
the dual 48 blocks and the 96 - switching them out is a
breeze, programming is fun, easy, nice. I also have ex-
perience with Eppendorfs (not the ones you mention)
and they have also been very easy to use. Good luck
- of that list I would pick the BioRad and stay away
from Techne...
3) I recently bought 2 bio rad c1000s and they are AWE-
SOME. Pcrs that used to barely work on other ma-
chines in my old labs seem to pick up for some reason
on these guys and I very rarely have well edge evap-
oration on plates. We had a few problems but they
were tied to old rmware and their support was helpful
and the upgrade cleared things up. Hopefully they willbe long term lasting units. I've only had my position
here for a few years but all signs suggest they should
be good.
4) We have both the Eppendorf Nexus Mastercycler
Gradient and the BioRad C1000. I'm not a big fan
of the Eppendorf one. The programming is not in-
tuitive (we often have to break out the manual) and
we get some evaporation with certain plate/seal com-
bos. LOVE the C1000. The touch screen makes it
very easy to program and it's very exible in terms of
plates/seals/mats (i.e., no evaporation).
5) We've had a single-block C1000 (pre-Touch version)
for more than two years and we love it. There was an
issue with the mechanics of the lid, and when I com-
plained about it Bio-Rad happily upgraded us to the
newer version of the lid assembly and re-QC'd the whole
machine, etc., all at their expense (including overnight
shipping in both directions). I think they're a class act.
6) We're using a C1000, and thus far, I'm pleasantly im-
pressed with them. It does what we need to do, and is
pretty easy to set up and program. I like it better than
the old ABI one I've used, and it's much better than
the MBS we used to have from thermosher. We've
only been running them for a month now, so I can't
comment on long- term stability.

new to download from my website:
www.treender.de If I had made a new Treender ver-
sion, there might have been the following new features:
(1) More intensive tree search by providing additional
search levels, which had been a straight-forward thing
to do, and which could have further improved the search
among large trees.
(2) Possibly a lot of new models and methods, but IOctober 1, 2013 EvolDir 89
cannot tell because I have stopped observing the latest
literature.
(3) Publication of my tree search algorithm ... yes, it
is still unpublished! I did not have the opportunity,
because my employment ended too early.
You may have noticed that I am currently not very
motivated to continue the Treender project due to the
lack of support. Nobody has oered me a good salary
for continuing my work, nor has anybody oered me a
reward for what I have worked in the past.
I consider closing down my website, because it only
costs me money and does not earn me an income.
The interesting question is about what to do with my
software and its source codes? - I am not going to
make it available for free by storing it in some inter-
net archive. Science does not deserve my software if it
does not support me. Anyone interested in buying the
project? Or shall I better charge for downloading? If
yes, then how much? But I doubt this would earn me
a reasonable income. Shall I redraw my permission to
use Treender at all? Any suggestions?

Tribolium wildtype strains
Dear EvolDir members,
For a morphological evolution project I'd like to screen
several wildtype strains of Tribolium castaneum, T.
freemani and T. madens for natural variation in sev-
eral morphological traits. I already obtained nearly all
available strains which were kept at the Tribolium Stock
Center at the USDA-ARS Center for Grain and Ani-
mal Health Research, Manhattan, KS. However, some
of those strains are fairly old and I would like to extend
my analysis to more recently collected strains.
If anyone has strains (isofemale lines or freshly col-
lected) and is willing to share them, I'd highly appre-
ciate it!
Please feel free to contact me if you need more details
about the project itself or if you have any other kind of
questions.
Thank you very much in advance!

microMorph grants
Dear colleagues,90 EvolDir October 1, 2013
microMORPH is pleased to announce a funding oppor-
tunity for graduate students, postdoctorals, and assis-
tant professors in plant development or plant evolution.
$3,500 is available to support cross-disciplinary visits
between labs or institutions for a period of a few weeks
to an entire semester. We are particularly interested
in proposals that will add a developmental perspective
to a study of the evolution of populations or closely re-
lated species, or conversely, proposals to add a micro-
evolutionary perspective to developmental studies. The
deadline for proposals is November 1, 2013. More in-
formation about the training grants and the application
process may be found on the microMORPH website:
http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/microMORPH/-
grantsandfunding.html These internships are
supported by a ve-year grant from the National
Science Foundation entitled microMORPH: Molecular
and Organismic Research in Plant History. This
grant is part of the Research Coordination Network
(RCN) Program at NSF. The overarching goal of the
microMORPH RCN is to study speciation and the
diversication of plants by linking genes through devel-
opment to morphology, and ultimately to adaptation
and tness, within the dynamic context of natural
populations and closely related species.
If you would prefer not to receive any more emails
from me about the microMORPH RCN, please email
me back with the word \NO" in the subject line and
we will remove you from the mailing list. We will use
this list for occasional updates on funding opportunitiesthrough the microMORPH RCN, and yearly workshops
hosted by microMORPH.

Avignon France SelectionDrift
Postdoctoral Position in modeling population genetics
of invasive species
We seek to hire a post-doctoral research associate
for a Grand Federative Project funded by the French
Agropolis Fondation1 called BIOFIS \Bioagressors and
invasive species: from individual to population to
species". The project is dedicated to develop, coordi-
nate and communicate research actions on bioagressors
in Europe (insects, mites, trees, fungi and virus) and92 EvolDir October 1, 2013
on their associated natural enemies. It is coordinated
by A. Estoup and J.-Y. Rasplus (CBGP, Montpellier,
France).
Term: The position could begin as early as December
2013, and as late as December 2014. Support is for one
year.
Location: This position is co-supervised by E. Klein
(INRA - BIOSP, Avignon France) and V. Ravign e
(CIRAD - BGPI, Saint-Pierre, R eunion island, France
until July 2014 and Montpellier, France afterwards).
We encourage applicants to be based in Avignon, with
possibly one or two short stays in R eunion island, but
other combinations can be envisaged.
Eligibility: Agropolis Fondation typically considers ap-
plications from candidates that have not resided or
carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc) in
France for more than 12 months in the 3 years imme-
diately prior to the date of submission of the proposal
and that have obtained their PhD degree for no more
than 3 years upon the date of application. However,
we encourage excellent candidates not entirely fulll-
ing these conditions to contact us, as these might be
funded if no other eligible candidate satises scientic
requirements for the job.
Project: Developing empirical approaches aiming at de-
tecting traces of selection during bioinvasions relies on
the analysis of the spatial genetic structure of popu-
lations at a large number of loci in colonizing species
(genome scan). However, the strong eects of genetic
drift associated to the specic demography of an ex-
pansion (in particular successive funding eects dis-
tributed in space) interact with selection and might
lead to erroneous conclusions. To better understand
the interaction between drift, selection, dispersal, we
wish to design and analyze spatially explicit simulation
models allowing studying the spatial spread of bene-
cial/neutral/deleterious mutations during a coloniza-
tion process. We are particularly interested in study-
ing the eect of i) environmental heterogeneity and ii)
non-standard mating systems (e.g., mixing sexual and
asexual reproduction) on the process. In the end, these
theoretical results may be confronted to population ge-
netics data in dierent species.
We seek a young researcher who combines very good
technical talent for modeling (mathematical and com-
puter science skills) with an interest and enthusiasm
for invasion processes and population genetics. Expe-
rience with programming, bioinformatics and popula-
tion genetics is required. Skills in data analysis are
not necessary but will be considered positively. Facility
in writing is important. The post-doc will benet by
working as a member of the BIOFIS project team withan extent network of collaborators interested in disper-
sal, invasion biology, plant pathology, evolutionary bi-
ology and population genetics. 1 Agropolis Fondation:

CIBIO (http://cibio.up.pt) is a young and highly dy-
namic research centre located near Porto, in Northern
Portugal, which conducts world-class research in the
elds of biodiversity and evolution. The Centre oers
great opportunities for multidisciplinary and stimulat-
ing research and hosts 18 research groups, which in-
clude more than 100 PhD level researchers, and over
100 MSc and PhD students, from many dierent coun-
tries. The working atmosphere is vibrant, multicultural
and enthusiastic, and we host regularly international
scientists for short term visits. The Centre has state of
the art ecology and molecular laboratories (equipped
with multiple PCR rooms, automated sequencers, real-
time PCR machines, etc), and a next-gen sequencing
platform. Research projects are performed at a global
scale. The Northern region of Portugal provides rich
cultural and outdoor activities and Porto is a world-
heritage town and the capital of Port wine.
We are now advertising a 12 months full research
contract, possibly renewable, funded by an FP7 CA-
PACITIES program (FP7-REGPOT-CT-2011-286431-
CIBIO-New-gen) and expect to recruit an enthusiastic
and highly motivated researcher in the area of Human
Evolutionary Genetics.
The Human and Evolutionary Research Group's inter-
ests cover dierent research topics related to the evolu-
tionary history of human genes and populations, using
genome-wide sequencing and SNP data. A strong focus
will be devoted to the demographic history of AfricanOctober 1, 2013 EvolDir 93
populations, in particular to southern Angolan groups
that are pivotal to understand the peopling of Southern
Africa. A particular emphasis will be given to the anal-
ysis of spatial patterns of genetic variation. As an addi-
tional topic, the work on Southern Angola will include
the analysis of the genetic diversity of cattle and sheep
breeds held by peoples relying on farming and herding
to dierent extents. The candidate is expected to have
an interdisciplinary attitude, rather oriented towards
data analysis than to data generation. Accordingly,
s/he will have a sound knowledge of population genetics
theory and master dierent kinds of data analysis soft-
ware to interpret human population genetic data. Ad-
ditional computer programing skills will be considered
an advantage. Applicants should have a PhD degree
and a good publication record in SCI journals. Flu-
ency in English (spoken and written) is required. As

CNRS Moulis EvolutionDispersal
An 18 month position for a post-doctoral researcher on
a funded project examining the evolution of dispersal
and sociality is now available at our lab.The impact of human activity is causing increasing
habitat fragmentation as well as rapid changes in the
environment. To survive changes, species must search
for and nd new habitats in a fragmented landscape
or risk extinction. Our understanding of the long
term viability of fragmented habitat patches, or meta-
populations, is based on natural systems but we know
very little about how species will respond to increased
fragmentation and increasing attempts at movement
among patches. How will species react to fragmentation
and anthropogenic impacts and how will they navigate
this new landscape? How individual heterogeneity will
impact this evolution?
The focus of the project funded by the ANR is centered
on condition-dependent dispersal, meta-population dy-
namics, individual heterogeneity, and the evolution of
sociality (cooperation). This project seeks to experi-
mentally manipulate parameters of dispersal behavior,
heterogeneity of source populations, and social aggre-
gations to understand trade-os and key determinants
of the evolution of animal movement. The project is
lab based, using Tetrahymena thermophila{a unicel-
lular ciliated protist{as a model organism. This sys-
tem provides broad opportunities to test theory and
conduct controlled experiments at both short (behav-
ior across a few hours) and long time scales (evolu-
tion across ~6 months). Experiments to be determined
by the post-doc in collaboration with the PIs will ex-
plore the evolutionary response of an organism and the
critical features that allow persistence in fragmented
habitats and navigation of altered landscapes. Our
recent work has shown genetic variation in dispersal
and cooperative behavior among clonal lines (individ-
ual heterogeneity) and has investigated some elements
of condition-dependent dispersal (information use, dis-
persal phenotypes, plasticity).
The ideal candidate will have a strong interest and the-
oretical background in the evolution of dispersal, so-
ciality, and/or have experience with lab work (genetic
or cell culture). The duration of the funded position is
18 months with a possible extension of up to one year.
This project is lead by Dr. Jean Clobert and the suc-
cessful candidate will work with both Dr. Clobert and
Dr. Alexis Chaine and interact with other experts in
dispersal and landscape ecology at the lab. The re-
search group is in the foothills of the French Pyrenees
Mountains at a CNRS eld station (Moulis / Saint
Girons). The newly renovated lab has state of the art
facilities including a cell culture lab and genomics lab
that will be used by this project. The lab has a small,
but vibrant permanent research group and augments its
academic circle through frequent interactions with the
Ecology group at Toulouse and numerous international94 EvolDir October 1, 2013
visiting scientists each year.
Informal inquiries can be sent to Jean Clobert
(jean.clobert@ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr) or Alexis Chaine
(alexis.chaine@ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr). Applicants
should send a letter of intent explaining why you

Paris, France
A 2year postdoc position is available to work on the
\Modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of Dengue in
Cambodia accounting for viral evolution" at the De-
partment of Ecology and Evolution, Paris (ENS) under
the supervision of Professor Bernard Cazelles.
Today, Dengue fever represents a major challenge in
public health and threatens especially South-East Asia.
The objective of DENFRE European Project (http://-
www.denfree.eu/) is to improve our knowledge on the
ecological and evolutionary dynamics of Dengue in this
area to design innovative public health measures. This
project is strongly interdisciplinary and is composed by
epidemiologists, biologists, computer scientists, statis-
ticians and mathematicians.
As a part of this research project, the successful can-
didate will have to develop cutting- edge models that
would be used synergistically with empirical data on
disease incidence, viral genetic and antigenic variation.
These mathematical and/or computational models of
dengue propagation will be supported by epidemiologi-
cal and antigenic data from DENFREE consortium, in
close relationship with the Pasteur Institute in Cambo-
dia. In particularly, the successful candidate will haveto account for heterogeneous and highly interdependent
data through a Bayesian framework. This approach is
suciently exible to design phylodynamic models that
account for non-linear disease dynamics, molecular se-
lection and population structure. This modeling will
also take the advantage of the PLoM plateform (http:/-
/www.plom.io) in close collaboration with its founders.
The successful applicant will be broadly trained in
quantitative biology and evolutionary biology or a re-
lated eld (PhD or equivalent degree required), with
expertise in one or more of the following areas: com-
puter science, mathematics, and computational biol-
ogy. A previous experience in biological modeling is
expected. A strong taste for inter- disciplinary research
is required.
The appointment is for two years can start between
November 2013 and January 2014. The net salary will
be approximately of 24,000 Euros per year but can de-
pend on the previous experiences of the candidate.
Applications should include a motivation letter, a CV
including a list of publications, and the address of two-
three references. The applications, as well informal en-
quiries about the position, should be sent to: cazelles-

IJM Paris AnimalEvolution
Dear Colleagues,
Please pass along the following announcement regard-
ing a postdoc position open in our laboratory to any
potential candidate.
A two-year post-doctoral position is available in the
group of Guillaume Balavoine and Michel Vervoort at
the Institut Jacques Monod (IJM) in Paris (France).
The IJM is a leading French biological research insti-
tute, comprising about 25 interactive research groups
and high-quality technological facilities, including a
cutting-edge imaging platform.The primary research fo-
cusof the group is to reconstruct the early stages of an-
imal evolution, by comparing the genetic networks that
regulate the developmental patterning of key aspects
of the body plan across metazoans. The main model
studied by the group is the annelid worm Platynereis
dumerilii, an emerging model species. Platynereis is
a member of the Spiralian/Lophotrochozoan branch of
the bilaterian tree and is hypothesized to be as close to
a \bilaterian living fossil" as a bilaterian can be, both
in terms of genome organization and body plan.
The post-doc project aims at understanding and mod-
elling cell movements and cell shape changes that di-
rect CNS and segment morphogenesis in Platynereis, as
well as determining the roles of the Planar Cell Polar-
ity (PCP) and Rho/ROCK/MyoII pathways in these
behaviours. The project will be centered on the use
of live imaging, molecular and modelling tools. Can-
didates should have a strong background in develop-
mental and/or evolutionary biology. Expertise in live
imaging would also be welcome. Candidates must
hold a Ph.D. degree in developmental or evolution-
ary biology and have at least one rst author publi-
cation in a peer-reviewed journal. Potential candidates
should send their application by mail to Guillaume Bal-October 1, 2013 EvolDir 97
avoine (balavoine.guillaume@ijm.univ-paris-diderot.fr)
and Michel Vervoort (vervoort.michel@ijm.univ-paris-

Vitae and contact informations for two referees. The
position will remain open until lled; however appli-
cations received by September 30th 2013 will be given
priority. The starting date is preferably before the end
of 2013.

postdoc position in evolutionary genomics of hybrid
sh. This project is nanced for ve years and there is a
possibility for an extension of up to two years. Project
start is February 2014 and the postdoc should ideally102 EvolDir October 1, 2013
begin work in spring 2014. The salary of the postdoc
will be according to the standard German pay scale in-
cluding all social benets (TV oD E13 salary).
The postdoc will assume a central position in our
project \EVOLMAPPING" that is funded through an
ERC starting grant. The goal of this project is to ana-
lyze evolutionary genetic processes in invasive Cottus, a
lineage of sh that represents an example for the early
steps of hybrid speciation. We will perform an exhaus-
tive search of the Cottus genome to identify genes in-
volved in evolutionary change induced through natural
hybridization. The strategy is to integrate analyses of
gene expression, genetic mapping and screens for geno-
typic selection in laboratory populations and wild sh
to identify the links between genotypic and phenotypic
evolution. Note that we are oering PhD positions
in the framework of the EVOLMAPPING project and
that the postdoc can interact with students and and
contribute to the development of their projects.
We are seeking a postdoc with skills in programming
(scripts and analysis pipelines), genetic mapping, next
generation sequence analysis and genome evolution.
The postdoc is expected to actively contribute in our
ongoing collaborations with colleagues studying pop-
ulation genomics and whole genome re-sequencing of
Gasterosteus and mice and who develop programs for
mapping new genome sequences to distantly related ref-
erence genomes. The core dataset that will be gener-
ated includes Illumina sequencing of more than 20 Cot-
tus genomes for population genomics, some of which
will be used for de novo genome assembly. The latter
will be supported by up to date approaches to facilitate
genome assembly as for example sequencing of large in-
sert libraries and RAD tag mapping of laboratory F2
crosses and natural hybrids to aid genome assembly.
The expected output of the postdoc is to contribute
to the genome assembly and to compare the genomic
makeup of invasive Cottus with their parental species.
The postdoc will be involved in fundamental research
questions on comparative genomics relating to adaptive
evolution and speciation and in comparisons between
Cottus and distant reference genomes and we highly
appreciate a creative postdoc who contributes to and
extends our research agenda to learn about evolution-
ary change in hybrid sh.

NHM UOslo PlantSpeciation
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in biosystematics (plant
speciation)
A 4-year position as postdoctoral research fellow (SKO
1017) in biosystematics/evolutionary biology (specia-
tion in plants) is available at Natural History Museum
(NHM), University of Oslo.
Job Description
Decreasing biodiversity with increasing latitude is a ma-
jor pattern in ecology, often suggested to be caused by
reduced speciation rates towards the north. The Arc-
tic harbours little diversity in terms of named species.
However, our recent research has demonstrated excep-
tionally high speciation rates in arctic diploid plants,
resulting in many reproductively isolated but cryptic
species, and showed that intrinsic postzygotic isolation
is based on several loci and genetic mechanisms. Ongo-
ing work has expanded these ndings by more detailed
genetic mapping and QTL analyses as well as by exten-sive crossing experiments, showing that reproductive
barriers arise in spite of recent population divergence
and that high speciation rates occur across four dif-
ferent plant families. A selng mating system seems to
accelerate the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities.
The current postdoctoral project involves eld work
and comparative experiments with species from out-
side the Arctic as well as further exploration of genetic
mechanisms, based on genome/transcriptome sequenc-
ing to identify speciation genes. Parts of the project
will be carried out during research visits to interna-
tional collaborators. Detailed research plans will be
developed together with the successful applicant. The
position is funded by the NHM, but the successful appli-
cant will be expected to assist in developing proposals
for additional external funding to cover running costs.
Requirements
The successful applicant should be an active researcher
with a PhD in plant systematics or other relevant elds
in evolutionary biology, and should preferably have ex-
perience in experimental work with plant cultures and
in high-throughput sequencing technology.
Personal Skills
High working capacity Excellent collaborative skills Ex-
cellent command of written and oral English (docu-
mented) Strong dedication and motivation
We oer salary based on salary level 57-65 (NOK 473
400 - 548 700 per year) a challenging and friendly work-
ing environment membership in the Norwegian Public
Service Pension Fund attractive welfare arrangements

UArizona ConvergentEvolution
*Functional genetics of convergent evolution*
A postdoctoral position to study convergent evolutionof insect resistance to plant toxins is available in the lab-
oratory of Dr. Noah Whiteman at Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona.
The postdoctoral fellow will test the broad hypothesis
that antagonistic pleiotropy constrains adaptive evolu-
tion in toxin resistance genes that are present as sin-
gle copies leading to a pattern of convergent molecular
evolution, a constraint that is relaxed after gene dupli-
cation events. To test this hypothesis the postdoctoral
researcher will transform *D. melanogaster* with toxin
resistance gene constructs from several insect species
and then conduct toxin-feeding and tness trials. This
position is funded by a grant from the Templeton Foun-
dation for up to three years.
Prospective applicants should hold a Ph.D. or expect
one by January 2014 and have extensive experience
with the biology of *D. melanogaster*. The position
is ideally suited for a *Drosophila *biologist who would
like to gain a skill set in evolutionary biology and func-
tional genetics. Creative latitude will be given to the
postdoctoral scholar to push the project in ways that
leverage their unique skills and interests. There will
be many opportunities to intellectually participate in
related projects in insect comparative, population and
functional genomics taking place in the Whiteman Lab-
oratory.
This project is part of a larger, three-way collabora-
tion between the laboratories of Dr. Noah Whiteman
(University of Arizona), Dr. Anurag Agrawal (Cor-
nell University) and Dr. Susanne Dobler (University
of Hamburg) on the ecological, evolutionary and func-
tional bases of convergent evolution of toxin resistance
in insects. The postdoctoral scholar will have the op-
portunity to: travel to a yearly meeting of the three col-
laborative research groups and to other scientic meet-
ings, help lead the writing of manuscripts, co-mentor
students and help supervise a technical assistant. The
postdoctoral scholar will also have the opportunity to
engage with the large and vibrant community of biol-
ogists at the University of Arizona. This includes The
Center for Insect Science, which has a long-running,
inter-departmental postdoctoral training program in in-
sect biology.
Quality of life in Tucson is high. Tucson is situated
in southern Arizona and has a population size of about
500,000. Southern Arizona is extremely progressive and
Tucson has a vibrant downtown connected to the Uni-
versity of Arizona by a new modern streetcar system.
The University of Arizona, founded before Arizona be-
came a state, sits on a beautiful campus that includes
the oldest managed green-space in Arizona, contain-
ing native vegetation and olive and citrus groves. Tuc-
son is surrounded by the relatively wet Sonoran Desert,October 1, 2013 EvolDir 113
which is home to 300 species of plants and four stunning

EvolutionPlantDefence
Two postdocs on structure-activity relationships and
evolution of a chemical plant defense at Department
of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of
Copenhagen
In a multidisciplinary project, we have two postdoc po-
sitions available for two and a half year each to study
the relationship between saponin chemical structuresOctober 1, 2013 EvolDir 115
and their biological activity, ecological function, diver-
sity and evolution.
Job description Triterpenoid saponins constitute a
structurally diverse class of natural plant defense com-
pounds, which are wide spread across the plant king-
dom, and appear to have evolved recurrently through
evolution. Specically, triterpenoid saponins in the
wild crucifer species Barbarea vulgaris are responsible
for natural resistance towards a devastating agricultural
pest, the diamond back moth (DBM), and other insect
herbivores. The DBM is the most serious pest of cru-
cifer crops worldwide, and discovery of new sources of
resistance has great potential in plant protection. De-
spite their potential for plant protection in production,
we know surprisingly little about which saponin struc-
tures are toxic to certain herbivores, and which are not.
In a multidisciplinary project, we have two postdoc
positions available to study the relationship between
saponin chemical structures and their biological activ-
ity, ecological function, diversity and evolution. A PhD
student and a postdoc working within plant biochem-
istry and plant metabolomics, respectively, will also be
employed on the project.
One postdoc (no 1) will identify and analyse enzyme
encoding genes involved in the triterpenoid saponin
pathway, and metabolically engineer novel saponins
in model plants, transiently in tobacco and stably in
Arabidopsis thaliana, by expressing combinations of
biosynthetic genes from a range of plant species to
produce known and new-to-nature triterpenoid saponin
genes. Based on this, Structure- Activity-Relationships
(SAR) will be addressed using e.g bioassays.
The other postdoc (no 2) will explore natural variation
in saponins in Barbarea vulgaris and related species,
with special focus on interspecic hybrids, and study
the eect of these on selected insect herbivores. Plants
with novel saponin structures and resistance will be
analysed for associated gene and enzyme-composition.
For both positions, a palette of diverse saponin struc-
tures will be tested in bioassays and experiments with
specialist and generalist insect herbivores, as well as
in insect cell lines, to decode which saponin structures
have a given specic biological activity and function.
Some of the bioassays will be done in collaboration with
our international collaborators.
The postdoc projects are to be carried out in an inter-
nationally competitive cross-disciplinary research team,
including ecological, evolutionary, genetic, molecular
and biochemical aspects of plant resistance. The re-
search environment is stimulating and international
with English being the working language. Short re-
search stays within laboratories of our internationalcollaborators outside Denmark are envisioned. The re-
search environment is nancially supported by funding
from the EU and from the Danish Council for Indepen-
dent Research.
Your key tasks as postdoc fellows at the Faculty of
Science are to develop the research project using your
knowledge within plant biology, ecology and evolution,
and/or biotechnology, and by applying the appropriate
state-of-the-art technologies and innovative approaches
to advance your work. Dedication and the ability to col-
laborate and prot from interactions with other mem-
bers of the research group and aliated research groups
are additional success criteria.
Qualication requirements For both postdocs
.Documented research qualications such as a PhD or
equivalent. .Fluency in English. UCPH generally en-
courages employees who do not speak Danish to acquire
a working knowledge of the language. .Broad curiosity
in biological questions and open-mindedness to cross-
disciplinary research. .Good interpersonal skills and

ULausanne PhD
EvolutionOfSexChromosomes
Postdoc and PhD positions: Evolution of sex chromo-
somes
Several postdoc, bioinformatician and PhD positions
are available in a collaborative project on the evolu-
tion of sex chromosomes in plants and animals. The
project is a funded by a Sinergia grant from the Swiss
National Science Foundation and brings together the
labs of Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin, Texas), Nicolas Per-
rin, and John Pannell (Lausanne, Switzerland). We are
studying the evolutionary genomics in plant and ani-
mal systems that have largely recombining sex chromo-
somes. In contrast to model systems such as mammals
and ies, these sex chromosomes are highly dynamic
parts of the genome. Our project will address ques-
tions such as: how does recombination evolve, what
drives the rapid turnover in genetic sex determining
systems, and what role does sex-antagonistic selection
play in genome evolution?
We are looking for researchers with strong backgrounds
in evolutionary genetics and/or bioinformatics. The
project will involve tight collaboration between the-
ory and modelling (conducted principally in the Kirk-
patrick lab in Austin) and testing of the models using
amphibian (Perrin lab in Lausanne) and plant mod-
els (Pannell lab in Lausanne). The collaboration will
involve travel between labs, and the empirical work
in Lausanne will be conducted by researchers working
side-by-side in groups interested broadly in the evolu-
tion of sexual systems, sex allocation, sexual dimor-
phism and sex chromosomes. The theoretical compo-
nent will involve both analytical and simulation mod-
elling. The empirical components will involve eld
work, crosses, the building of genetic linkage maps, andthe analysis of molecular and genomic variation pro-
duced by NextGen sequencing of multiple genomes and
transcriptomes.
The project is funded for three years. We hope
to start empirical work by January, 2014. Informal
enquiries about empirical parts of the project can
be directed to Nicolas Perrin (nicolas.perrin@unil.ch)
and John Pannell (john.pannell@unil.ch), and about
modelling and statistical parts to Mark Kirkpatrick
(kirkp@mail.utexas.edu). Applications can be sent by
email to one of the principal investigators and should
include a detailed motivation letter, a curriculum vitae,
and the names and addresses of two referees.
Full consideration will be given to applications received
by the 31st October.

UOxford StatisticalGenomics
The position of Postdoctoral Scientist is available in Dr
Danny Wilson's group at the University of Oxford to
lead research on the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society
funded project \Statistical Methods for Whole Genome
Phenotype Mapping in Bacterial Populations".
Bacteria cause disease throughout the world. Dierent
strains vary in disease severity, but the genetic vari-
ants responsible remain largely undiscovered. Recent
breakthroughs in whole genome sequencing provide new
opportunities for discovery, but the lack of statistical
analysis tools tailored to the special structure of bacte-
rial populations presents a roadblock. The goal of the
project is to develop an analysis framework for map-
ping genes underlying naturally variable traits in bac-
terial populations. Focusing on the hospital-associated
pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium dif-
cile, we will investigate the role of bacterial variants
on disease severity.
The role of the Postdoctoral Scientist is to develop novel
statistical methods for analysing genotype-phenotype
associations in bacteria at the whole genome level. The
successful candidate will write software implementing
the statistical methods and apply them to design and
carry out investigations into the genetic basis of vir-
ulence in natural populations of bacterial pathogens.
The ideal candidate would be a recently graduating
PhD student with experience of statistical genetics and
computer programming, with evidence of publicly re-
leased software. Experience of population genetics or
microbiology would be advantageous but is not essen-
tial.

USussex BeeEvolution
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Ecology (Bees and Pes-
ticides) Three year post, available from 1 February
2014, based at the University of Sussex (Falmer, near
Brighton, UK). Closing date 15 November 2013.
A full-time, BBSRC-funded, 3-year postdoctoral re-
search position is available to join a research team in
the School of Life Sciences at the University of Sussex,
UK. The programme of research, titled \A systems ap-proach to understanding the impacts of sublethal doses
of neonicotinoids on bumblebee and honeybees" is led
by Prof Dave Goulson, and is a collaborative project
with University of Exeter and Rothamsted Research.
The main aim of the project is to improve our under-
standing of the impact of pesticides on wild bumble-
bee colonies and domesticated honeybees in farmland.
This is currently highly topical since a two year morato-
rium on certain uses of neonicotinoids comes in to place
in December 2013. Additional evidence is urgently re-
quired to inform the debate as to whether this morato-
rium should be renewed / extended or allowed to lapse.
This project will: produce landscape maps of sources of
neonicotinoid exposure; examine the eect of neonicoti-
noid exposure on the homing abilities of bees; examine
impacts of realistic levels of exposure to neonicotinoids
on bumblebee colonies. Exeter will incorporate these
data into systems models of bumblebee and honeybee
colony development and survival, and the predictions of
these models will be validated with further eld studies.
Overall, we intend to develop management recommen-
dations to minimise the impacts of neonicotinoids on
both managed honeybees and wild bumblebee popula-
tions.
The project will involve collection of eld samples of
pollen, nectar, vegetation and bees for screening for
neonicotinoid insecticides. The screening will be carried
out in conjunction with Prof E Hill, and technical sup-
port is available for this. Expertise in chemical analysis
is therefore not needed, but the fellow will be expected
to become familiar with interpretation and analysis of
outputs.
The successful applicant will have a PhD in ecology.
Experience with social insects, pollinators, agroecosys-
tems and / or pesticides is desirable but not essential.
Knowledge of experimental design and analysis is es-
sential. A driving licence is essential.
The appointee will also be part of the Evolution,
Behaviour and Environment (EBE) Subject Group
in the School of Life Sciences at Sussex (http://-
www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/ebe/research), a thriving re-
search environment providing ample opportunities to
interact with leading senior researchers and their
groups. The successful applicant will particularly bene-
t from an exceptional (on a world scale) concentration
of research expertise that focusses on social insects: in
addition to Dave Goulson, Jeremy Field, Francis Rat-
nieks, Bill Hughes, Tom Collett and Paul Graham all
lead well-established research groups.
APPLICATIONS PROCEDURE
Applications should include a CV, a covering letter ex-October 1, 2013 EvolDir 125
plaining the applicant's suitability for the post, and a
completed University of Sussex application form. This
should include:
1. Contact details (including e-mail addresses) for the
applicant and 3 referees who would be available to pro-
vide references before interview (during the month after
the closing date).
2. The applicant's availability for interview at Sussex

the EDRC congress website.
The main goal of the workshop is to explore whether
there exist mutual interests among people studying
the population genomics of European /Drosophila/
(mainly /melanogaster/ and /simulans/, but other
species might be of interest as well) in initiating a joint,
collaborative European network.
This is an extremely exciting time for population ge-
nomic studies. The recent advent of powerful next-
generation sequencing (NGS) techniques allows us to
examine genetic variation at unprecedent scales, at the
whole-genome level and with single nucleotide resolu-
tion. The continuing technological improvements and
the dropping costs of these methods means that even
single labs can now generate terabytes of sequence datavery rapidly a relatively low cost. However, the re-
sulting data are typically used to address only a very
limited number of specic questions, so that the overall
value of these datasets for the community as a whole
is somewhat limited. To foster the integration and ex-
change of population genomic information, we therefore
propose that individual European labs build up a joint
eort in collecting and generating population genomic
data for /Drosophila/ species across Europe.
During the workshop we would like to discuss (1) how
to develop a collaborative strategy for sampling dier-
ent European /Drosophila/ populations through space
and time in order to generate a unique European collec-
tion of samples for future sequence (and possibly phe-
notype) analysis; (2) how to best generate high-quality
sequence data from such samples; and (3) how to op-
timally integrate the resulting data and information so
that it can be used to answer a wide range of questions.
We would also like to explore potential funding oppor-
tunities that could be used to support regular meetings
of the network and that would foster scientic exchange
and collaboration among the labs involved.
We are looking forward to seeing you in Barcelona!

WHERE: Bertinoro, Italy WHAT: Autumn school
\Landscape genetics in transition to landscape ge-
nomics" WHEN: 3 - 9 November 2013
Landscape genomics is an exciting and rapidly grow-
ing discipline that combines genome-wide patterns of
genetic variation, large environmental data sets and
spatial statistical methods, to improve our understand-
ing of both species ecology and ecological adaptation.
This autumn school aims to provide an updated dis-
cussion of landscape genetics analysis in the new ge-
nomic era, guided by experts in genomics, spatial sta-
tistical analyses, and population genetics. It will in-
clude an assortment of conceptual, methodological and
applied contributions, followed by hands-on training in
order to provide an overview of novel approaches for
analysing the environmental context of genomic varia-
tion. The autumn school is aimed at early-career re-
searchers (PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and
faculty who wish to gain training in this area) who have
some background knowledge in population genetics and
landscape genetics but who have an interest in improv-
ing their skills with regards to the analysis of the en-
vironmental context of genome-wide genetic variation
obtained from novel NGS data. The autumn school will
have a limited number of participants (30) and lectures
(ca. 5).
Aim and Objectives This autumn school will provide
an excellent opportunity to introduce young scientists
(PhD students and postdocs) to the complex eld of
landscape genomics and familiarise them with the ap-
plication of novel analyses from dierent disciplines
that merge within this novel eld. The specic ob-
jectives of this workshop are: 1) Promote better un-
derstanding links between the novel genomic informa-
tion and spatially explicit analysis, in order to facilitate
interdisciplinary communication and education in the
new emerging eld of landscape genomics 2) Provide
an update of the current state of the landscape genetics
eld and the major challenges and opportunities by the
incorporation NGS data. 3) Explore recent analytical130 EvolDir October 1, 2013
advances in NGS of non-model species and gain expe-
rience about data collection, production and analysis
strategies in population genomics. 4) Provide hands-on
training for analysing the environmental context of ge-
netic (neutral and adaptive) variation through spatial
statistic and simulation modelling using the most recent
methods on landscape genetics/genomics. 5) Address
current research challenges and explore new opportuni-
ties to improve future landscape genomics applications,
and positively contribute to the future growth of this
promising eld.

/gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt Course description High-
throughput technologies such as next generation se-
quencing (NGS) are characterized for producing mas-
sive a mounts of data. These technologies for example
can allow to describe all variants in a genome or to de-
tect the whole set of transcripts that are present in aOctober 1, 2013 EvolDir 131
cell or tissue. However, at the same time, posses new
challenges in the way the data has to be analyzed, an-
notated and interpreted which are not trivial.
Whole Exome Sequencing produces sequence data us-
ing NGS assays and allows the study of genetic varia-
tions in the exonic regions of all genes that can be trans-
formed in biological information at an unprecedented
level of detail. Traditionally transcriptomic analysis has
been used to nd genes that are dierentially expressed
among distinct experimental conditions, or correlated
to diverse parameters. Currently, NGS technologies
such as RNA-seq can also allow to digitally quantify
all, known and unknown, transcripts or to discover new
isoforms and splice sites for all the genes.
However, NGS data analysis can be a major bottle-
neck for many researchers which are still applying in-
ecient tools for the processing of the data and inad-
equate methods for the interpretation of their results
in order to have meaningful results. This course covers
state-of-the-art tools and methods for NGS RNA-seq
and exome variant data analysis, which are of major
relevance in today's genomic and gene expression stud-
ies.
The aim of this course is to familiarise course partic-
ipants with the latest analysis methodologies and to
provide hands-on training on the analytical approaches
implemented for RNA-seq data and whole exome vari-
ant analysis.

ducing natural forest cover to its lowest level in the
Quaternary Period. A variety of modern technologies
have been developed that can accelerate and invigorate
conservation. This course will focus on how nascent
techniques can be used to monitor change in habitats
and biodiversity. We will investigate technological and
analytical advances in tropical conservation before de-
veloping a group project to implement these methods
to monitor species richness or biotic interactions. We
expect that group projects will result in at least one
multi-authored publication.
The course will consist of two parts: an online lec-
ture/discussion course in Spring 2014 and a four week
eld course in June 2014 at the Xishuangbanna Trop-
ical Botanical Garden (XTBG) in Yunnan, China, a
research institute in the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
All travel and accommodation expenses will be paid for
18 graduate students from any graduate degree grant-
ing institution in the U.S.A. or tropical Asia, funded by
the US National Science Foundation. An additional 12
mainland Chinese graduate students will be funded by
the Chinese Natural Science Foundation.

*Online course ::*Students will watch lecture videos on-
line prior to participating in a guided discussion that
will meet online once a week in Spring 2014 (February
- May). Students will form partnerships with class-
mates and perform research projects on specic regions
of the Asian tropics. Given the ease of web-based global
communication, the students will be expected to de-
velop prociency in communicating with peers across
technological, geographical, and cultural boundaries.
Guest lecturers for the course include Richard COR-
LETT (XTBG), Rhett HARRISON (Kunming Insti-
tute of Botany), Erik MEIJAARD (People and Na-
ture Consulting), Douglas SHEIL (Director, Institute
of Tropical Forest Conservation), Cam WEBB (Arnold
Arboretum/Harvard), and Jianchu XU (Chief Scientic
Ocer, ICRAF/China).
*Field course ::*The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical
Garden ( http://english.xtbg.cas.cn/ ) has been per-
forming scientic research and providing agro-forestry
outreach and training for over 50 years in the remote
southwestern corner of China, near the borders of Laos
and Myanmar. With an active community of interna-
tional scientists and graduate students, XTBG is a lead-
ing ecological and botanical research institute in the
Chinese Academy of Sciences. All students enrolled in
the course will travel to XTBG in June 2014 to partici-
pate in eld training, taxon-specic survey techniques,
and to complete one or more group projects. Several
guest lecturers from the online course will also give pre-
sentations during the eld the course, including addi-
tional lecturers, e.g. HE Fangliang (Ualberta), LUO
Shu-jin (Peking U.) and others.
*When/where:*4 weeks in June-July 2014 at XTBG,
Yunnan, China

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
