Dear colleagues,
You are kindly invited to attend the two-day, interna-
tional symposium “*Frontiers in Biodiversity: a Phylo-
genetic Perspective*”, which will be held in Barcelona,
Spain, the 1st and 2nd of October 2010.
The symposium is co-organized by the Biodiversity Re-
search Institute of the University of Barcelona (IrBio),
the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE, CSIC-UPF)
and the Zoological Systematics and Evolution research
group on the occasion of *the International year of Bio-
diversity*.
These are exciting times to conduct research on Bio-
diversity. The last years have witnessed the develop-
ment of new theoretical, computational and technolog-
ical tools for Biodiversity research at an unprecedented
rate. The symposium aims to explore the impact of
some of these new conceptual and methodological ap-
proaches on our current understanding of the origins
and the processes that shape Biodiversity. Research on
Biodiversity has multiple facets. In this symposium we
will emphasize the perspective and contributions com-
ing form the phylogenetic and phylogeographic front.
The symposium will focus on a selected list of “hot
topics” under the headings of Statistical phylogenetics
and phylogeography, Biogeography, Time, Key Innova-
tions, Adaptive radiations, Diversiﬁcation, Community
phylogenetics and Phylogenomics.
The symposium will consist of two morning sessions
with invited talks and an afternoon poster session opento participants. The symposium will close with a round
table with the invited speakers on the topic “*Biodi-
versity in the omics era*”. The list of conﬁrmed speak-
ers include Fr´ ed´ eric Delsuc (Universit´ e Montpellier II,
France), Steven W. Kembel (University of Oregon, US),
L. Lacey Knowles (University of Michigan, US), Brian
R. Moore (University of California, Davis, US), Daniel
L. Rabosky (University of California, Berkeley, US),
Isabel Sanmartin (Real Jardin Botanico, CSIC, Spain)
and Ziheng Yang (University College London, UK).
The symposium will be held at the *Institute of Cata-
lan Studies (/Institut d’Estudis Catalans/, IEC),* lo-
cated at the heart of Barcelona’s old town, in the 17th
century Santa Creu Hospital building.
The registration fee is 80EUR. There is no deadline
for registration and poster abstract submission, but at-
tendance will be limited to *100* *participants* and
the number of posters to *30*. Both registration and
poster contributions will be accepted on *ﬁrst-come,
ﬁrst-served* basis, and will close once we reach the
maximum number of contributors.
Detailed information, including conference titles, can
be found on the conference website:

Natural environments diﬀer in many biotic and abiotic
aspects, and the way in which animals and plants adapt
to these diﬀerent environments is one of the fundamen-
tal questions of ecology and evolutionary biology. In
recent years, new genetic and genomic methods have
been developed, making it possible to discover the genes
involved in such adaptations. This has facilitated many
new exciting insights, for instance into
* the functional mechanisms of adaptation * the molec-
ular evolution of adaptively important genes * the ge-
netic architecture of evolving traits * the convergent
evolution of similar phenotypic traits by distinct muta-
tions * the ecology of speciation
We organize a symposium bringing together six invited
speakers including top empirical and theoretical evolu-
tionary biologists and a number of younger researchers
to discuss recent developments in this fast developing
ﬁeld.

1. Environmental Genomics (including 1-2 postdoc po-
sitions) New genomic approaches for Biodiversity stud-
ies of Australian Soils, Water, Grasses, Forensic sam-
ples and Antarctic biota A number of PhD positions are
available in a large-scale project to apply high through-
put sequencing approaches to the analysis of environ-
mental samples and develop a new range of methods to
perform biodiversity surveys, taxonomic discovery, and
environmental impact reports. The project will employ
multiplexed PCR, 2nd/3rd Gen Sequencing, Bioinfor-
matics and Phylogenetics to develop novel systems for
rapid and accurate biodiversity assessment. Key top-
ics within the project are the analysis of Australian
soils, natural and re-use water supplies, Australian na-
tive grasses, Antarctic biota, and forensic material. A
strong molecular Biology and/or bioinformatics back-
ground is required. The project is a $1M Australian
Research Council-industry partnership.
1-2 postdoc positions will also be available for this
project, and will carry supervisory responsibilities for
the PhD projects. It is anticipated that one position
will be oriented towards data generation, and another
towards bioinformatics/database analysis.
2. Evolutionary Bioinformatics This project will apply
the latest evolutionary bioinformatics methods to the
study of ancient and modern DNA generated through
new genomics and 3rd Gen sequencing data. Study
species include a wide range of ancient humans, domes-
tic animals, environmental samples, and broader evo-
lutionary projects such as marsupial evolution, and ex-
tinct species such as thylacines, mammoths and other
megafauna. The datasets will include genomic sequenc-
ing projects, SNP arrays and multigene phylogenies.3. Ancient human DNA and Domestication genomics
Several project opportunities are available to work with
ancient humans, animals and plants. These projects
will use advanced new genomic techniques to study an-
cient populations and species, and focus on evolution-
ary history, archaeology/anthropology, and the study
of domestic/commensal animals to trace human move-
ment, and identify and analyse genetic loci under selec-
tion. The methods used will include SNP and capture
array approaches, and a strong expertise in molecular
biology and bioinformatics is required. Recent stud-
ies have examined Neolithic farmers in Europe, pre-
Columbian South Americans, and bovids, chickens, pigs
, and rats from around the world.

Barcelona 2 GeneNetworkEvolution
Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Dep of Genetics
and Microbiology
We are looking for two students, preferably a biolo-
gists, to start two grants for two PhD in systems biology
and/or evo-devo about:
-Gene network simulation in pattern formation, mor-
phogenesis and morphological evolution.
or/and
-Compartive embryonic morphometrics
One of the current challenges of evolutionary biology
is to understand how genetic variation leads to speciﬁc
morphological variation (the g-p map) and how that
process aﬀects the direction of morphological change in
evolution. Our group is devoted to address this ques-
tion by using gene network models.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.
The grants are provided by the Spanish ministry of sci-
ence and innovation. One of them is for 4 years and the
other is for 3 years extendable to an additional year.
The exact topic of the theses would be discussed in de-
tail after interview.

LandscapeGenomics
A PhD position is available at Ecole Polytechnique
F´ ed´ erale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, Labora-
tory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG) (4
years)
*Topic*: Very High Resolution Digital Elevation Mod-
els (VHR DEMs) and multiscale analysis using the
wavelet transform: an application to landscape ge-
nomics *Key-words*: GIS, spatial analysis, DEMs,
landscape genetics, landscape genomics, natural selec-
tion, adaptation, signal processing, wavelet transform,
structure tensors *Supervisors*: Dr St´ ephane Joost
(LASIG, EPFL); Prof Dimitri Van De Ville (Medical
Image Processing Lab, EPFL & University of Geneva);
Prof Fran¸ cois Golay (LASIG, EPFL)
*Description of the PhD project* Digital Elevation
Models (DEMs) are able to provide a diversity of
geomorphometric (slope, aspect, curvature), hydro-
morphometric (e.g. wetness), and also climatic
(e.g.solar radiation) predictors. But DEMs are under-
exploited environmental variables in landscape genet-
ics and landscape genomics. In particular, increasingly
available Very High Resolution DEMs (1 m for XY
coordinates, and ~0.5 m for Z) acquired with LIDAR
(Light Detection And Ranging) technology, are able to
generate high-resolution habitat predictors (Andrew &
Ustin 2009), and make it possible to implement a novel
multiscale analysis. A recent PhD thesis (Kalbermat-
ten 2010) showed that the application of the wavelet
transform (signal processing theory) is a clever way to
generalize topography.
A powerful feature of Wavelets applied to DEMs is the
capacity to decompose DEMs into multiscale spaces.
This permit to come closer to what happens in nature
as regards the concept of scale, and to replicate at best
the spatial continuum constituting landscapes.
Moreover, wavelet coeﬃcients can be interpreted as
pixel value changes (gradients) in a local neighbour-
hood (a window of 3x3 pixels for example) on the basis
of which it is possible to construct 3 additional DEM
derivatives (structure tensors): the energy of the local10 EvolDir August 1, 2010
gradient, the dominant orientation of local structures,
and coherency (indication of isotropy/anisotropy).
The goal of the thesis is to apply the wavelet transform
approach and to use the new DEM variables (second
order derivatives) described hereabove in the context
of diﬀerent case studies (plants, wild and domestic an-
imals) implementing the landscape genomics approach
(see Hanotte et al. 2010) to detect loci possibly under
natural selection (Joost et al. 2007; Manel et al. 2010).
This research context is ideal to address a fundamen-
tal issue often referred as to “What is the best spatial
scale to study adaptation” or “at which spatial scale
does adaptation operate ?”
*Requirements for the position* Master in Science (bi-
ology, environment, computer & communication, etc.),
excellent skills in GIS and spatial analysis, excellent
skills in population genetics, background in landscape
ecology/landscape genetics, good mathematical back-
ground, basics in signal processing, good knowledge
of statistics, initiative, high motivation, teamwork, ﬂu-
ency in english, french is an advantage (oﬃcial language
in Lausanne area).

GlaxoSmithKline sponsored PhD Studentship
In Computational Biology
Department of Computing, Imperial College London
PhD Studentship: Applications are invited for an
EPSRC/CASE funded PhD studentship supervised
by Dr. Nata ˚Aa Pr ˚A3
4ulj at Imperial College*.
*CASE studentships are awarded jointly to aca-
demic and industrial partners, and provide an ex-
citing opportunity to work with cutting edge data
and leading scientists from both research environ-
ments. The successful applicant will work both at
Imperial College and at the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
Computational Biology group at Stevenage. Eligi-
ble applicants will receive an untaxed bursary of
ˆA£15,200 per annum, UK/EU fees and a bursary
top-up provided by GSK. Details regarding student
eligibility can be found at http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/-
PostgraduateTraining/StudentEligibility.htm Fixed
Term for 3 years, starting October 2010.
The PhD studentship, under the supervision of Dr.
Nata ˚Aa Pr ˚A3
4ulj and in collaboration with scientists
at GlaxoSmithKline in Stevenage (UK), will address
the question of integrating diﬀerent types of large scale
biological data with the aim to redeﬁne disease classi-
ﬁcation and relationships between diseases. Most dis-
eases have been deﬁned a century or more ago. The
question is whether the old classiﬁcation holds in the
light of modern systems-level data, including genetics
data (e.g. genome-wide association studies), genomics
data (e.g. microarray), protein-protein interaction net-
works, metabolic networks, phenotypic data etc. For
example, cancer types are being redeﬁned with molec-
ular data. Furthermore, there is evidence that manyAugust 1, 2010 EvolDir 11
complex seemingly unrelated diseases, such as cancer,
diabetes and Alzheimerˆ as, originate from a disruption
in metabolism, raising the possibility that disease (phe-
notypes) can be clustered according to common mech-
anisms. Thus far, diseases have been classiﬁed focus-
ing locally only on the organ the most aﬀected by the
disease. Instead, the research project will consider dis-
eases as systems-level disorders of the entire cellular
system that includes genetics, molecular interactions
and metabolism, and that aﬀect every cell of the body,
rather than through just symptoms that they are pre-
senting. Network science approach will be taken to
present various slices of systems-level biological infor-
mation in an integrated way that will allow mining of
these complex data. This approach to biological data
network integration will lead to the design of network-
based mathematical models and computational tools
aiming to improve disease classiﬁcation. The ﬁnal goal
is to improve biological understanding, get insights into
disease and, in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline,
improve the disease indication(s) decision for therapeu-
tics. The student will spend a minimum of 3 months at
GlaxoSmithKline during the PhD, during which time
GlaxoSmithKline will cover any additional expenses
(e.g., commuting).

The impact of disease on parental care
Primary supervisor: Dr Sheena Cotter Secondary su-
pervisor: Prof Bob Elwood
Superﬁcially, the raising of oﬀspring by two parents
appears to be a cooperative and harmonious venture.
However, it often masks an evolutionary battle, as in
reality families are at war: mothers and fathers would
both prefer their partner to do more work, brothers
and sisters are rivals for their parents’ attention, and
children want more from their parents than parents are
willing to give. As a result, the amount of care we see
parents delivering is the compromise that attempts to
resolve this conﬂict. But what happens when condi-
tions change?
Disease is a common threat that could change the
amount of care that parents deliver. They may need
to spend more eﬀort on getting healthy and so neglect
their children, or diseased parents may lavish extra care
on their children because they are unlikely to survive
to have more.
This PhD studentship will address the eﬀects of disease
on parental care using a combination of pathogen and
hormonal manipulations in a model system: the bury-
ing beetle. Also known as “gravediggers” these bee-
tles breed on small vertebrate corpses and are almost
unique in that both parents prepare food, feed and care
for their oﬀspring.
The student will receive training in: Insect rearing,
collection and pedigrees, immune function assays, hor-
monal manipulations, pathogen bioassays, experimen-
tal design and statistical analysis.

Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, BEES, UNSW,
Sydney AUSTRALIA. www.bees.unsw.edu.au/school/-
staﬀ/sherwin/sherwinwilliam.html Project 1: Weeds
adapting to Australia: rate and direction of evolution.
With A Moles, R Frankham. As well as threatening
biodiversity, introduced species also allow us to study
processes of adaptation and invasion. We are measuring
changes in form, function and genetic make-up of intro-
duced species since their arrival in Australia. This posi-
tion would focus on the genetical aspects of the project,
using genetic approaches which include microsatellite
assignment of origins, 454 sequencing, and common-
garden experiments. You should be qualiﬁed in pop-
ulation genetics, or molecular sciences. There may be
some ﬁeldwork. Ecology qualiﬁcations are desirable.
Project 2: Resilience of small populations to periods
of selection A consortium of mathematicians and biolo-
gists at UNSW has produced new theory about the way
that small endangered populations might rapidly re-
cover their responsiveness to selection. This PhD posi-
tion will follow up this theoretical work by carrying out
experiments in model populations of ﬂies. There could
be an additional stipend supplement for this project.
You should be qualiﬁed in maths/physics/computing,
or in population genetics.
Project 3: Forecasting demography of bottlenose dol-
phins With partners from Murdoch University we are
studying ecology, threats, and genetics of Bunbury
(WA) bottlenose dolphins. The PhD student at UNSWwill use these data in existing or novel programs,
to evaluate population viability with diﬀerent man-
agement and threats. The work involves integration
between demographic, ecological, and genetical ap-
proaches There would be ﬁeld-trips to Bunbury. You
should be qualiﬁed in population ecology. Molecular
ecology qualiﬁcations are desirable.
Project 4: Conservation of Little Penguins in New
South Wales: With Dr J Sinclair. To assess the via-
bility of an endangered population of Little Penguins
in Sydney Harbour under a range of threats and man-
agement strategies. The PhD student would conduct
a molecular genetic and demographic analysis on NSW
penguin populations, to input into a population fore-
casting model. The project involves some ﬁeldwork and
molecular laboratory work. There could be an addi-
tional stipend supplement for this project.
Other projects: It is possible to negotiate other projects
in this general area of research. Note that projects
which are theoretical or use existing data in Sherwin’s
group, are much quicker to start because they can com-
mence without application for external funding of re-
search expenses!

UAuckland MicrobialEvolution
PhD position in New Zealand available beginning
November/December 2010, these include stipends and
course fees.
We are seeking enthusiastic PhD candidates with inter-
ests in both fundamental and applied aspects of micro-
bial ecology and evolution, biogeography and genetics
to join our group in Biological Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Auckland, New Zealand.
We have recently been awarded funds to provide op-
tions to improve NZ wines (and thus exports). One of
the roles of the Goddard group in the program is to test
the hypothesis that diﬀerent regions of NZ have diﬀer-
ent microbial communities and populations, and then
to test some members of these communities for theirpotential to contribute to novel wine attributes during
the fermentation process.
This projects will integrate ecological theory (we are
fundamentally testing ideas concerning species com-
position in space and time, and the degree to which
these species are adapted to the niches in which they
are found), molecular biology and genetics (including
next-generation sequencing, as tools to quantify species
presence and abundance and diﬀerentiate and quantify
relatedness of individuals within species) and applied
aspects of yeast ecology (examining the impact of can-
didate yeasts on wine aroma and ﬂavour using experi-
mental fermentation and volatile analyses).
The student will be expected to gather samples from
vineyards and wineries around NZ, then use micro-
biology and molecular biology techniques to analyze
communities and populations, then employ community
ecology and population genetic analyses to test the hy-
potheses of interest. The PhD student will go onto
examine the ﬁtness landscapes of these isolates from
diﬀerent areas and niches, and also screen isolates, and
interactions between isolates, for strains of potential
worth to the wine industry - i.e. do any of them make
interesting/diﬀerent wine? This may also provide the
student with GC-MS and sensory analysis experience.
This position provides a tax-free stipend of NZD$25,000
per annum for 3 years; the successful applicant must
ensure they have the correct immigration permit. You
will be part of a close-knit, friendly team in the God-
dard group that will interact with the other program
partners in the University, Plant and Food Research
(a Crown Research Institute) and Lincoln University,
as well as collaborating wine companies in Auckland,
Hawkes Bay, Marlborough and Central Otago.

Molecular basis of resource polymorphism
Two Ph.D. positions are available at the University of
Iceland, Institute of Biology.
We are seeking two PhD students to work on an inter-
disciplinary project studying the genetic and molecular
mechanisms underlying the formation and rapid evolu-tion of diverse cranial morphology in Icelandic Arctic
charr (Salvelinus alpinus). The research group is coor-
dinated by prof. Sigurdur S. Snorrason, and the molec-
ular work will be performed under the supervision of
Drs. Zophon´ ıas O. J´ onsson, Arnar P´ alsson, Sigr´ ıur Rut
Franzd´ ottir and Valerie H. Maier which have expertise
in developmental and molecular biology, genomics and
population genetics.
The candidates should hold an M.Sc. degree or equiva-
lent in biology, have a strong background in molecular
biology and be highly motivated. A good ability to
work in a team is essential.
The project addresses questions in developmental ge-
netics and evolutionary genetics, concerning the origin
of skeletal divergence and parallel evolution. Over the
last 10 000 years Arctic charr in Iceland has evolved
an extensive variation in morphology and life history.
We are interested in studying the diﬀerences in develop-
ment of key craniofacial elements in contrasting morphs
of this non-model species.
Speciﬁcally, we are aiming at elucidating the genes un-
derlying morphological diﬀerences in size, and skeletal
and craniofacial features among Arctic charr morphs.
The projects will include sampling, cloning and charac-
terization of candidate genes, transcriptional analysis,
in situs and other molecular methods. One of the two
projects will also involve a study of evolutionary forces,
by documenting variation in developmental genes in
morphologically distinct morphs.
The University of Iceland is located in the center of
Reykjavik. The laboratory shares facilities with several
groups in the ﬁeld of molecular biology, genetics and
evolutionary biology, with state of the art equipment
for these studies. The students will be part of a research
environment of around 40 graduate students, post-docs
and senior researchers. The student will also be part
of the Graduate Program in Molecular Life Sciences at
the University of Iceland http://www.gpmls.hi.is Start
date: autumn 2010 or on agreement.

Our laboratory is eager to receive application from
highly motivated scientists with an excellent record to
apply to a Quebec government fellowship available for
non-Canadian candidates to study in a Quebec- based
laboratory. Doctoral fellowships are available. Further-
more, internships are available for a visit to our labora-
tory (3000$can/ month, up to 4 months) during gradu-
ate studies in another laboratory. Pre-selection by the
host university and our laboratory is mandatory.
Candidates from all over the world are invited to ap-
ply. Additionally, speciﬁc fellowships are available for
candidates from Mexico, Brazil, China and Wallonie.
We are in the Department of Biology at Laval Univer-
sity, located in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Our lab-
oratory is part of the Institute of Integrative and Sys-
tems Biology (IBIS). We study the underlying molec-
ular and hormonal causes of variation in behaviour in
vertebrates. We are interested in personality with an
emphasis on the stress response and correlation among
behaviours, as well as in reproductive tactics. We are
also interested by the eﬀects of the environment on de-
velopment of behaviour, such as environmental enrich-
ment in captive animals, maternal/paternal and social
group eﬀects, and endocrine disrupters. We therefore
have a strong interest for phenotypic plasticity, along
with the eﬀects of genetic variation. We favour an in-
tegrative approach by linking data from the same in-
dividual: neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and their
receptors (quantitative Real-Time PCR, microarrays,
in situ hybridization, HPLC), hormones (EIA, HPLC),
physiology and behaviour. Our model system is the
threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, a small
ﬁsh studied in behavioural biology, which can be kept
easily in the lab and whose genome is sequenced.
Laval University is one of the ten main Canadian uni-
versities. Quebec City is dynamic with all the advan-
tages of a large city while still allowing for very easy
access to wilderness and very reasonable cost of living.
The chosen candidates that are successful at obtaining
a fellowship will be part of the Institute of Integrative
and Systems Biology. They will have access to core
genomics and molecular biology facilities, lab meetings
and Institute-wide group meetings, journal clubs and
weekly seminars at the Institute and in the BiologyDepartment. Several ecological genomics laboratories
are part of the Institute and the Biology department,
allowing for enriched interactions with members of the
other laboratories working in this ﬁeld. DEADLINES:
Our laboratory must receive applications before July
23, 2010. We will then proceed to select candidates
that will be able to apply to the University pre-selection
committee with a deadline of August 9th 2010. Can-
didates selected by the university will then be allowed
to apply to the general competition in Fall 2010, with
results given in April 2011. Start date can be between
May and December 2011.

UManchester Evolution of social
evolution
A PhD studentship is available at the University of
Manchester to examine the eﬀect of ecological factors
and life-history trade-oﬀs on social success and cheat-
ing. The project integrates concepts from ecology, so-
cial evolution and life-history evolution with a devel-
opmental genetics perspective. It provides opportuni-
ties for students to develop both theoretical and empir-
ical/experimental skills (though the project is strongly
experimentally driven).
The project will use the social amoeba Dictyostelium
discoideum as a model organism. D. discoideum is an
excellent model system to examine the genetic basis of
cooperation and cheating because free living individu-
als aggregate to make a multicellular ’organism’ (the
’slug’) that goes through development to form a dead
stalk that holds aloft a sporehead. Because diﬀerent
genotypes will aggregate to form chimeric slugs, com-
petition for space in the sporehead should lead to strong
selection to become viable spores rather than dead stalk
cells. The aim of this studentship is to ask how nat-ural variation in social success is maintained and how
cheater spread is mitigated in D. discoideum in the face
of this strong selection.
The project will be jointly supervised by Daniel Rozen
and Chris Thompson in new state of the art labora-
tory facilities in the Faculty of Life Sciences (University
of Manchester). The student will beneﬁt from expo-
sure to and training in a wide variety of diﬀerent tech-
niques, ranging from quantitative data handling, theo-
retical population genetics, experimental evolution and
statistical analysis to genetics and molecular cell biol-
ogy. Importantly, you will also work closely with Jason
Wolf at the University of Bath, where additional math-
ematical, theoretical or data analysis training needs will
be met.
The studentship would begin at either the September
2010 or January 2011 intake dates.

One Ph.D. position is available at the University Paul
Sabatier (Toulouse 3, France),Lab. UMR 5174 “ Evolu-
tion et Diversit´ e Biologique ” (CNRS grant for 3 years,
1757 euros brut/month) Sex chromosome evolution and
Y degeneration within the Primates lineage.
We are seeking PhD student to work on an interdisci-
plinary project studying the molecular mechanisms un-
derlying the evolution of sex chromosomes and Y degen-
eration in mammals (Primates). The candidates should
hold an M.Sc. degree (M2R) or equivalent in biology,
have a strong background in molecular and evolutive
biology and be highly motivated. A good ability to
work in a team is essential.
The project addresses questions in molecular evolu-
tion and evolutionary genetics, concerning the origin
of sex chromosome divergence and Y degeneration in
mammals, and speciﬁcally Primates (Lahn & Page,
1999 Skaletsky et al., 2003, Wilson & Makova, 2009,
Charlesworth & Charlesworth, 2000; Graves, 2006). We
propose a ﬁne-scale comparative genomic approach to
determine (1) the respective component of the evolu-24 EvolDir August 1, 2010
tionary forces (genetic drift, nature and intensity of
selection...) driving the molecular evolution of sex
chromosomes and the Y degeneration; (2) the speciﬁc
factors involved in the evolution of the X-Y homolo-
gous gene pairs. The ﬁne-scale approach, together with
intra-speciﬁc data, would enable us to identify micro-
evolutionary processes of the sex chromosomes evolu-
tion and Y degeneration. This project includes diﬀer-
ent approaches: 1. Evolutionary mode and rates. The
objective of this ﬁrst axis will be to compare, at a ﬁne
taxonomic scale, the molecular evolution of the X- and
Y-linked genes. This comparative genomic approach
would enable us to ﬁnely characterise the evolutionary
mode and rate of the homologous genes pairs. 2. Se-
lective pressure. The objective will be to characterise
the selective pressure acting on each gene copy and de-
termine whether the selection pressure have been the
same throughout the X and Y evolutionary histories,
the diﬀerent Primate lineages and the genes. Is the na-
ture of selection acting on the X and Y copy similar
(background selection, selective sweep, balancing selec-
tion)? Is the intensity of selection diﬀerent between the
X and Y and among lineages?
The University Paul Sabatier is located in the South of
France, near Pyr´ en´ ees. The laboratory shares facilities
with several groups in the ﬁeld of molecular biology,
genetics and evolutionary biology, with state of the art
equipment for these studies. The students will be part
of a research environment of around 60 graduate stu-
dents, post-docs and senior researchers.
Start date: 1st of October 2010. Those interested,

UPrinceEdwardIsland Biogeography
MSc.Geographic ranges.UPrinceEdwardIsland
All species have limits to their geographic and ecologi-cal distributions, but the causes of these limits remain
largely unknown. While reduced dispersal, physiologi-
cal limits and/or genetic constraints to adaptation are
likely to play a role in determining distributional lim-
its, more empirical research is needed to understand
and predict where individual species can and cannot
occur.
An MSc position in evolutionary ecology is available
in the lab of Dr. Karen Samis at the University of
Prince Edward Island starting Sept. 2010 (option Jan
or May 2011, and potential to convert to PhD). Dr.
Samis is interested in local adaption and the limits to
geographic ranges, and is looking for students demon-
strating an interest in plant evolution and ecology. The
potential project will assess ﬁne-scale genetic structure
and phylogeography in Atlantic Canada populations of
Cakile edentula (American sea rocket), and survey large
to small-scale spatial variation in habitat, life history
and ﬁtness to assess distributional limits from both
ecological and geographic perspectives. This plant is
endemic to coastal beaches, tends to occur on white
sandy beaches from the high tide line to the open dune
and is common in its native Atlantic range from New-
foundland, Canada to Florida, USA. The project may
involve a combination of range-wide ﬁeld surveys, com-
mon garden experiments and DNA analysis. Potential
students should have some experience with ﬁeld ecol-
ogy and/or molecular genetics, and have demonstrated
an ability to work eﬃciently and independently. Pref-
erence will be given to students who are competitive
for Canadian graduate scholarships, but students who
are eligible for graduate funding from an international
agency will also be considered. Interested students are
encouraged to contact Dr. Samis for more information,
and to submit a pdf ﬁle including a cover letter explain-
ing their interest and suitability for the position, their
CV and contact information for at least two references
to ksamis@upei.ca.
The University of Prince Edward Island
in Charlottetown, the provincial capital
(www.city.charlottetown.pe.ca ), is ideally suited
for the study of coastal plants with numerous coastal
beaches within a short drive of campus and a strong
marine ecology program. The Biology Department is a
vibrant community with a broad range of faculty, post-
doctoral and graduate researchers focused on human
health, environmental, wildlife and marine biology, and
ecology and evolution. Graduate students have the op-
portunity to teach undergraduate labs, attend research
seminars and interact with scientists in other research
units on campus including the Atlantic Veterinary
College, NRC and Agriculture Canada. Please see the

UUppsala AvianGenomics
PhD position in speciation genomics of a non-model
bird species
A 4-year PhD position in speciation genomics is avail-
able in the research group of Dr. Jochen Wolf at the
Department of Evolutionary Biology in Uppsala, Swe-
den.
Background The study of speciation mechanisms re-
mains one of the major challenges in fundamental bi-
ological research. The hybrid zone in Europe between
Carrion Crows (Corvus [corone] corone) and Hooded
Crows (Corvus [corone] cornix) is a text book example
of speciation that has been studied from ecological, be-
havioral, and morphological perspectives. In contrast,
the genetic architecture of the hybrid zone is poorly
understood. The crow system represents a case of a
very early phase of species divergence that requires new
molecular approaches for its comprehensive description.
The project We use several approaches to understand
the underlying genetic foundation of this hybrid zone
and to identify the few decisive genetic diﬀerences be-
tween the two taxa. These include a candidate (pig-
mentation) gene approach, whole genome shotgun se-
quencing and digital expression analysis.
The successful applicant ideally has a strong back-
ground in bioinformatics and experience in handling
large sequencing data sets. She/he will be highly in-
volved in de novo assembly of paired end shotgun
sequence reads using a combination of Illumina and
Roche 454 technology to obtain a ﬁrst draft of the crow
genome. This draft sequence will then be used as a
reference for re-sequencing several populations and to
conduct population genomic analyses. Therefore, the
project also requires a fundamental understanding of
population genetic theory.The candidate will also be involved in handling tran-
scriptome data from crows that are currently being
raised in a common garden setup. At a later stage in
the project it wil also be possible to analyze transcrip-
tome data from a separate project on mallards (Anas
platyrhynchos). Given the interest, the transcriptome
work also oﬀers the opportunity for the candidate to
gain experience in the lab including the preparation of
barcoded cDNA libraries for several sequencing plat-
forms.
Environment
My group forms part of a recently launched Cen-
tre of Excellence, the Uppsala Centre for Evolution
and Genomics ( http://www.uceg.uu.se ). It is sit-
uated in the Department of Evolutionary Biology,
which excels in many aspects of genetics and evo-
lution. The department oﬀers an inspiring interna-
tional atmosphere, with researchers from around the
world. My group also closely interacts with other
groups across departmental boundaries to exchange
ideas about good solutions for handling next gener-
ation sequencing data ( http://www.egs.uu.se/evbiol/-
Persons/Jochen/NGS Club.html ). We also collaborate
on research projects with the Max Planck Institute
of Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany and the Max
Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Pl¨ on, Ger-
many.
The Evolutionary Biology Centre is one of world’s lead-
ing research institutions in evolutionary biology and en-
compasses a wide variety of disciplines in the biological
sciences. It is situated in Uppsala in Sweden, a beauti-
ful small city of that oﬀers rich opportunities in cultural
and outdoor activities. The culture and activities of the
city are strongly inﬂuenced by the 40 000 students liv-
ing there.
Application To apply, please send a letter describ-
ing your research experience and interests, a CV, and
two letters of recommendation to Dr. Jochen Wolf
at jochen.wolf@ebc.uu.se. The position will be ﬁlled
as soon as a suitable candidate has been found. For

GROUP LEADER POSITION (BARCELONA,
SPAIN)
The Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE,
www.ibe.upf-csic.es ) is a research institute run by the
Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient´ ıﬁcas (CSIC)
and the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). The IBE is
currently located in the CMIMA ( www.cmima.csic.es )
and PRBB (www.prbb.org) buildings, in Barcelona,
while a building with new spaces is being prepared in
the same campus.
The IBE currently consists of 18 research groups con-
ducting basic research in many aspects of evolution-
ary biology. The research groups strongly interact with
other groups located in the area and have access to out-
standing scientiﬁc facilities both at the PRBB and the
city of Barcelona, including state-of-the-art core ser-vices such as animal facilities, bioinformatics, genomics,
ultrasequencing and many others.
The IBE is recruiting outstanding scientists as group
leaders, and a position is currently open under the sub-
ject “Gen´ omica comparada y ﬁlogenia” (“Comparative
genomics and phylogenetics”). The IBE would espe-
cially welcome now candidates conducting research on
either phylogenetics or statistical genomics. Phyloge-
netics candidates should carry out research on animal
biodiversity from a phylogenetic perspective with the
aim of gaining further insight, not only into the tree
of life itself, but especially on the evolutionary pro-
cesses that gave rise to current biodiversity patterns.

Dear Folks,
following the line of work that our group began a
year ago we have added a new video that we be-
lieve can help in tasks related to teaching evolution.
You can see it at: http://webs.uvigo.es/plantecology/-
divulgacion.en.html The new video illustrates thechanges that have had occur in the shape of skull in
diﬀerent lineages of the family of bats Phyllostomidae,
related to the transition to diﬀerent types of diet from
an insectivorous ancestor.
This video was created for free use as teaching material.
If anyone is interested, can download a version freely.
I hope you enjoy it.

Azores and I am trying to get as many samples I can of
two deep-sea shrimp species for molecular studies. The
species I am interested in are *Acanthephyra pelagica
*and *Acanthephyra eximia *from any part of the At-

dscatarino@gmail.comDivergence to MutationRate
answers
Recently, I posed the following question to the Evoldir
community:
*****
I would like to calculate a mutation rate per site, per
generation, from a mtDNA control region divergence
rate reported in the literature in units of divergence per
million years. In my calculation, I am assuming that
each species diverges at an equal rate, and I have a gen-
eration time of 5 years. The reported divergence rate
is 4.8% per million years. To get the mutation rate, I
divide 0.048/1,000,000, multiply by 5 for my generation
time and divide by 2 to account for the fact that I have
two lineages going diﬀerent directions. This gives me
a lineage-speciﬁc mutation rate of 1.2 x 10(-7) per-site,
per-generation.
That seems like an awfully slow rate for the control re-
gion. Where am I going wrong? I feel like my math is
oﬀ somehow but I can’t ﬁgure out where.
*****
I think the consensus is that (a) there are a lot of
caveats to calculating a mutation rate this way, but
mathematically it is correct, and (b) 1.2 x 10(-7) is well
within the range of control region evolution. Speciﬁc
responses to the question are listed below.
—–
The rationale behind your estimate of mutation rate
(strictly speaking substitution rate) looks correct to me.
A problem, though, might arise from equating short-
and long-term evolutionary rates. There is an exten-
sive literature on the slowing down of substitution rates
over longer evolutionary timescales.
For example, mutation rates estimated from pedigrees
on human mtDNA are at least an order of magnitude
higher than phylogenetic estimates. Similar conclusions
have repeatedly been reached for microorganisms. One
likely reason behind this discrepancy stems from puri-
fying selection acting in the long term.

—–42 EvolDir August 1, 2010
in 1.2 x 10(-7) per-site, per-generation, is this % or base
pairs... or something else?
When I see your calculation, you just transformed 4.8
% per my to 0.048 /1.000.000 and I dont know if what
you are really looking for is substitutions per genera-
tion (meaning, you have to account for the length of
the sequence in focus)? But perhabs I am also wrong
—–
It looks like you are starting with a relatively low di-
vergence rate (4.8%) to begin with in your calculations.
For example, some of the control region work that I
have done have 14.27% substitution per site per mil-
lion years.
—–
1.) There are diﬀerent rates in diﬀerent lineages so you
really need to use a rate speciﬁc to your lineage.
2.) I am not sure where you are getting the rate, but
if it is already in 4.8% per million years, it should be
the rate for that branch [i.e., you would not have to di-
vide by 2] - but double check where those ﬁgures came
from...
3.) Your math looks ok, I think it looks low just the way
you provide it.... 1.2 x 10(-7) per-site is really 12% per
million generations, with 5 years per generation you are
back to your 2.4 % per million years (but to reiterate
you may not have to divide by 2).
The 4.8% per million does seem slow for the control
region, but again it depends what species that ﬁgure
came from. I have found a lot of errors in published lit-
erature, so i would caution you against using previous
numbers without checking where they came from.
—–
I can’t comment on whether this is a reasonable rate for
the control region. In fact nobody could, because you
didn’t say what species you are working with. Presum-
ably animals, which have a region called “control re-
gion”, but are they humans, lizards, butterﬂies, horse-
shoe crabs, or what?
Another problem is that what you are calculating is not
the mutation rate, which is the rate at which a site ac-
tually changes from one base pair to another, but the
substitution rate, which is the mutation rate multiplied
by the ﬁxation probability for that region in those or-
ganisms. The two are commonly confused in everyday
language, but they are only equal for neutral mutations.
—–
1 x 10-7 seems actually pretty HIGH to me, compared
to rates for COI and cytb (we usually estimate a rateof about 1x10-8). Maybe for the d-loop this is normal?
You might look at Ho et al’s paper in MBE (Mol. Biol.
Evol. 22(7):1561-1568. 2005), for a discussion of mu-
tation rates and clocks in general. It looks like for the
d-loop in mammals they ﬁnd rates between 10 and 40%
per million years (or 1X10-7 per YEAR)
—–
I guess it all depends on what kind of rate was reported
in the literature exactly: If the reported rate is units of
divergence per million years ’per site’ your calculation
is correct. If it was units of divergence per million years
’for the mtDNA control region as a whole’ (so not per
nucleotide site), you would need to further divide your
rate by the number of nucleotide sites in that region to
get the per-site rate. This means that your rate would
become even slower.
I don’t know what rate values to expect from the
mtDNA control region,

Heiser tribute
TRIBUTE: To a remarkable biologist for his contribu-
tions to Evolution
We oﬀer a tribute to a remarkable evolutionary biol-
ogist, whose life’s work and publications set the stage
for our current understanding of the roles of hybridiza-
tion and introgression in nature and in the evolution
of crops and weeds. Here we summarize brieﬂy not
only his achievements and their inﬂuence on current
paradigms, but how we can learn today from the model
he exempliﬁed for research and student mentoring. As
in the Sherlock Holmes mysteries he loved, this scien-
tist’s full identity follows the initial clues. Enjoy the
discovery!
Born in 1920 in rural Indiana, this scientist’s ﬁrst pa-
per on sunﬂowers (Helianthus) appeared in the very
ﬁrst 1947 volume of Evolution (SSE), immediately pre-
ceding one by Ernst Mayr on ecological speciation; his
last papers, on the North American origins of domes-
ticated sunﬂowers were published in 2008 (Intl J. Plnt.Sci., Genet. Crop Resour. Crop Evol., PNAS). In his
ﬁrst paper, he argued that introgressive hybridization
between a pair of annual sunﬂowers increased the vari-
ability of the two species, yet each remained distinct.
Later, as a Distinguished Professor at Indiana Univer-
sity, he followed and valued greatly the contributions
of new advances in genomics to our understanding of
the role of introgression in the evolution of sunﬂowers,
other plants, and also animals as in long-term studies
of ﬁnches. The person we seek to honor is Charles B.
Heiser, a member of the National Academy of Sciences
whose diverse accomplishments are reﬂected in four no-
table presidencies: The Society for the Study of Evo-
lution (1974), American Society of Plant Taxonomists
(1967), Botanical Society of America (1980) and the
Society for Economic Botany (1978). So what can we
learn from his life about science, living life fully, and
sharing it with others?
Response: think broadly and critically, delve deeply,
be open to new perspectives, and share what you learn.
Together with the nearly 60 graduate students he ad-
vised directly at Indiana University, Heiser explored or
tested hypotheses of plant evolutionary biology in at
least 30 tropical and temperate genera of 14 diﬀerent
families (most notably sunﬂowers in the Asteraceae and
peppers in the Solanaceae). He thus imagined life’s di-
versity broadly in his research eﬀorts and their appli-
cation, pursuing not only many studies of hybridiza-
tion and polyploidy in relation to plant evolution, re-
productive isolation, and taxonomy (e.g. Aster, Ascle-
pias, Capsicum, Claytonia, Helianthus, Solanum), but
also conducting thorough investigations of the evolu-
tionary origins and uses of cultivated plants in these
genera and others (southwestern Proboscidea, or devils’
claw; bottle gourds and their pollination; Quinoa and
amaranths). His research contributed to the develop-
ment of the domesticated naranjilla ’orange’ of Ecuador
(Solanum quitoense), the loofah bath sponge (Luﬀa op-
erculata), and the cultagen Pepperomia ’Tena.’ Of
many awards (details in the upcoming Pl. Sci. Bull.
56 (3), ASPT), the international commendation from
the National Institute of Ecuador for Agricultural Re-
search for research in Ecuador was especially important
to him.
As exempliﬁed by his work with Jorge Soria in Ecuador,
Heiser also shared what he learned with the students
he mentored, his many collaborators, and a larger au-
dience of science-interested readers though books and
speaking engagements. His own most inﬂuential men-
tors hailed from his PhD. Institution, U.C. Berkeley
(i.e., G. Ledyard Stebbins, his advisor in ’spirit and
deed,’ Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 59: 370), and from Wash-
ington University in St. Louis, MO where he majored44 EvolDir August 1, 2010
in English, took his ﬁrst botany class, and completed
his MA. There his mentors were Robert Woodson (who
shared his vast knowledge of botany and Asclepias)
and Edgar Anderson (brilliant author of early papers
on hybridization and introgression, topics Heiser later
reviewed for the larger botanical community). Ander-
son stimulated Heiser’s ﬁrst studies of sunﬂower hy-
bridization, encouraging what became a lifelong inter-
est in how plants intersect with people. His pioneer-
ing work on weedy, hybridizing sunﬂowers, and their
importance in nascent North American agriculture, be-
came the subject of one of six books he published for
science-interested audiences. His books drew from ex-
tensive research on the evolution of domesticates from
their wild relatives, and indeed on the origin of agricul-
ture itself, as evident in his popular textbook, Seed to
Civilization. Heiser’s excellent writing, outreach to the
public, and his role in mentoring students earned him
both the prestigious Raven Outreach Award, from the
American Society of Plant Taxonomists, and the 2004
Garden Globe Award for ’best talent/writing.’
Charles B. Heiser died at his home in Bloomington, IN
on 11 June 2010, just short of his 90th birthday, from
complications of a stroke, but his

Holocene shells DNA isolation
Dear all
I would like to isolate DNA from holocene shells which
were obtained by boring with a drill in a lagoon area.
Those shells were estimated to be about 8500 years old
and the quantity available is about 20 mgr. I would
greatly appreciate if anyone with a similar experience
could provide feedback . The applications needed are
pcr/sequencing. I am not sure If there’s any DNA left
in those samples and moreover if the starting material
would be enough for the isolation procedure.
Thanks everyone Vasilis Papasotiropoulos

Hybridization with multilocus data
EvolDir community:
I have a microsatellite dataset comprising both sex-
ual diploid taxa and a set of asexual individuals (both
diploid and triploid) that we think are hybrids between
various combinations of these sexual diploids.August 1, 2010 EvolDir 45
I’m looking for a method that would allow me to assess
these hybridization scenarios with some sort of opti-
mality approach (ML, Bayesian, etc.), using the allele
frequencies of the potential parents and their putative
hybrid oﬀspring as input data. I’d be happy with soft-
ware that could handle the diploids-only scenario (both
diploid parents and hybrids), but if such methods exist
for the analysis of triploid hybrids and their putative
diploid parents that would be great.
I’ve dug around a bit, and both NewHybrids (Anderson
and Thompson 2002) and GenoDive (Miermans) may
oﬀer some of these functions. I’d appreciate any com-
ments from EvolDir users regarding these programs or
(especially) others that come to mind.

Lemey seminar July16
Philippe Lemey will be giving a free online seminar on
Friday July 16 at noon PDT on
“Phylogenetic diﬀusion models and their applications
in viral epidemiology”
Abstract: Emerging infectious diseases continue to ap-
pear all over the world, and importantly, they have also
risen signiﬁcantly over time after. Having the poten-
tial to quickly adapt to new hosts and environments,
RNA viruses are prime candidates to emerge as global
threats to human health. Their rapid rate of evolu-
tion, however, also turns viral genomes into valuable
resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal pro-
cesses that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics.
In this seminar, I will highlight recent developments in
phylogenetic diﬀusion models that tie together sequence
evolution and geographic history in a coherent statis-
tical framework. Both discrete and continuous phylo-
geographic models have recently been implemented in
a Bayesian statistical approach. I will position this ap-
proach among other popular phylogeographic methods,
and then focus on applications in viral molecular epi-
demiology to demonstrate their use. Finally, I will hint
at future extensions that may provide entirely new op-
portunities for phylogeographic hypothesis testing.For more information on how to attend this and other
seminars, visit phyloseminar.org.

Micro touchdown dropout answers
Hello, all–
Several months ago I posted a question on microsatellite
dropout with touchdown programs, and realized that I
have yet to put the replies together and send them out
to the list. Better late than never, I suppose! Thanks
to all who replied.
There didn’t seem to be a consensus position: some
people noticed dropout, some didn’t, many seem to run
touchdown programs with great success. No one could
point me to a paper, so the phenomenon may not be
published. Seems like it may vary considerably with46 EvolDir August 1, 2010
DNA source and genotyping technology. My original
question is below, followed by the replies:
Initial question:
Is there anything published on the frequency of allele
dropout when using touchdown programs to amplify
microsatellites?
Years ago, I tested some microsats (for crabs, I be-
lieve) with a touchdown program and with a range of
single-annealing temp programs. When I ran the PCRs
out on a BaseStation, it was obvious that in a signif-
icant number of instances the touchdown program re-
sulted in homozygotes, while the single-temp programs
showed heterozygotes. It appeared that in heterozy-
gotes, sometimes the smaller-length alleles were being
preferentially ampliﬁed with the touchdown program,
and the larger alleles were dropping out. Taking this
as a cautionary tale, I’ve always been careful to run
microsats with optimized single-temp programs. Other
than that, I never really followed up on it. I note now
that it is not uncommon to see papers that use touch-
down PCR to amplify microsats, and am curious if a)
there is anything published on the matter, and b) any-
one else has had noticed dropout (or not!) in program
comparisons.
Carolyn Tepolt carolyn.tepolt@gmail.com
Replies:
Unfortunately I don’t know of any publications that
discuss this issue but thought I’d drop you a line since
I have experienced the same thing myself. It’s been ex-
actly as you describe with the larger of the two alleles
dropping out with a touchdown but not with its own
single temp. It’s a shame since it was a good way of
getting lots of loci with varying Tm’s going in a multi-
plex. I guess it makes a bit of sense though since with a
touchdown, the ampliﬁcation gets going right at the ex-
treme limit of its Tm range. This would tend to favour
more easily ampliﬁed fragments ie the shorter ones. It’s
amazing really that such a small advantage can make
such a big diﬀerence but I guess since it happens early
in a reaction, the advantage is exponential.
As an aside, I got around this by having multiple Tm’s
in a reaction ie alternate cycles of two (or maybe three,
I can’t remember for sure) diﬀerent temperatures, but
with no touchdown between them. This helped a lot,
presumably because at the upper temp, the other loci
didn’t amplify at all so the allele length advantage was
removed. It was a bit of ﬁddling around but meant
I could keep my multiplex together and not have to
subsequently pool. I would give this a whirl if I found
myself in this situation again. Good luck.N.Aitken niccy.aitken@canberra.edu.au
*****
We didn’t notice any signiﬁcantly greater null-allele
problem with an optimized touchdown program vs. op-
timized single-temp program; in fact we noticed the op-
posite, but some of this may be due to our study.
For work described in a manuscript currently in revi-
sion, we used touchdown while amplifying loci in ex-
tracts from pericarps of Quercus acorns, for which the
DNA may be somewhat degraded. We used undiluted
extracts, and ampliﬁed three separate multiplex pan-
els totalling 10 loci, using touchdown programs opti-
mized for our species and tissue. To quantify error
rates we regenotyped a number of pericarps once or
twice and found that, on average, even in very good
samples about 1.7% of loci would be heterozygotes on
one run and homozygotes on another. For this paper,
we were assigning these pericarps to source trees, so
I wrote an R program to handle the potential impact
of null alleles upon assignment probabilities within a
likelihood context.
It seems that the large majority of our null alleles
were due to issues with pericarp DNA; for us the opti-
mized touchdown programs (plus not diluting our ex-
tracts) gave better results than optimized single-temp
programs.
Doug Scoﬁeld dgscoﬁeld@ucla.edu
*****
I almost always use touchdown, as it saves on months of
optimisation. Overall, it has given larger peaks for the
same samples. I have been using it for parentage, so I
know when there is a null allele. Null alleles have not
been a problem so far (except with 1/7 loci), despite 3
loci having large size ranges.
I am also keen to know if Qiagen multiplexing kits have
any inﬂuence on dropout rates. I’d imagine they should
as they are designed to amplify diﬀerent microsats of
vastly diﬀerent lengths in a single PCR.

Question on GMYC
Hi,
I’m trying to do the clustering on the phylogenetic tree
of 695 bacterial phoB proteins, but I have a couple of
questions for applying the GMYC model using R:
1. When I apply the single threshold method the sum-
mary is listed as below
method: single likelihood of null model: NaN maximum
likelihood of GMYC model: NaN likelihood ratio: NaN
result of LR test: NaNNA
number of ML clusters: 76 conﬁdence interval: NA-NA
number of ML entities: 481 conﬁdence interval: NA-
NAthreshold time: -0.0023826
Why the likelihood other parameters are NAN? When
I apply the multiple threshold model, after a long list
of likelihood (maybe), it shows an error... Does it have
something to do with the bootstrap value equal to zero
or the memory issue?
2. After I plot the test ( plot(test1) ), the clustered
tree is demonstrated. However, because the tree is very
compact with low resolution, you cannot diﬀerentiate
the 695 genomes at all, how can I output the clusters
and entities and parse them by myself?
3. If I want to construct a phylogenetic tree with high
conﬁdence before I do the clustering, can I just boot-
strap a tree using UPGMA method using MEGA? or
do I need to use the maximum likelihood method to
search the tree space, say, using PAUP?
Many thanks in advance!
Best wishes,

SmallScaleSNPs answers
Dear all,
Thank you for all the replies I received regarding meth-
ods for small scale SNP genotyping. It seems a com-
mon problem in evolution and ecology studies so I’ll
summarise the replies I got in this email. To save space
I’ll not acknowledge people individually (unless when
quoting their entire emails) but thank you all so much
for sending me the suggestions!
The most obvious one is restriction enzyme (PCR-
RFLP / CAPS): If the SNP is in a restriction site, you
can simply PCR across it, digest, and run on a gel.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/-
probe/doc/TechCAPS.shtml I was also recommended
the following tool for selecting restriction enzymes for
CAPS:http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/snp2caps/ If the SNP
isn’t in a restriction site, one may be engineered:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/-
probe/doc/TechDCAPS.shtml
Apart from restriction digestion, the most popular
methods are allele-speciﬁc PCR (AS-PCR) and related:
two allele-speciﬁc primers can be designed to comple-
ment the SNP at the 3’ end. There are many varia-
tions to this, e.g. labeling the two allele-speciﬁc primers
with diﬀerent ﬂuorescent dyes; making the two primers
diﬀerent lengths; running two separate reactions with
the reverse primers at diﬀerent locations so each allele-
speciﬁc product is of diﬀerent length; etc.
This could also be made medium-throughput:
Multiplex SNP-SCALE: a cost-eﬀective medium-
throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping
method
Kenta, T; Gratten, J; Haigh, NS, et al. (2008) MOLEC-
ULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES 8 (6) 1230-1238
David Remington kindly shared some experience in
primer design for AS-PCR:
’My strategy would be to use Primer3 or something sim-
ilar to design the primers to ensure you get something as
well-behaved as possible. You would use the sequence
for containing one of the two versions of the SNP, ﬁxing
the location of the SNP-speciﬁc primer and letting the
program pick the second primer. If the SNP-speciﬁc
primer has problems (e.g. too much internal base pair-
ing), you can try making the SNP-speciﬁc primer the
reverse primer rather than forward. Then use the other
SNP allele in the template sequence and try the corre-
sponding primer with the new 3’ base, and specify the
2nd primer the program found for the ﬁrst version to
see if that is still acceptable. This may get tricky, and
you might have to try a bunch of combinations, diﬀer-
ent 5’ starting points for the SNP-speciﬁc primer, etc.
As a last resort, you can relax the program’s parameters
slightly and see if you get something workable.
’I usually try for Tm close to 60 degrees (the Primer3
default) and use a touchdown cycle starting annealing
at 62 and stepping down to 55 or 52 over the ﬁrst 7-
10 cycles. That helps take care of the possibility of
additional mismatch sites causing problems. If you
need to pick less-than-optimal primers based on self-
complementarity, etc, doing a hot start on your PCR
can reduce problems with primer dimers. One nice
thing about this approach is that you’re not very lim-
ited in where the 2nd primer goes, since all you need to
do is see the band on a gel. It could be 200 bases away
or 1200.August 1, 2010 EvolDir 49
’I haven’t tried the following, but you could even use 2
diﬀerent 2nd primers for the two diﬀerent allele-speciﬁc
reactions to give you diﬀerent product lengths. Then
you could mix them together after PCR and run in the
same lane on the gel. It would essentially look like a
length polymorphism.’
And Pirmin Nietlisbach shared his own method:
’The discrimination among SNP states is achieved
through the competition of two reverse primers with
their 3’-end complementary to either SNP state and be-
ing of diﬀering length. One advantage of this method
is that it can be combined with microsatellite typing or
typing of several SNPs in the same multiplex PCR. I
am currently working on a manuscript on this method,
which I probably could send you sometime next week if
you are interested (let me know). I attach you a paper,
that also used almost the same method. The method
does need some optimization, but I am not aware of a
method that does not (even sequencing may pose some
problems and potentially require cloning, if heterozy-
gotes are not obvious in the electropherogram). How-
ever, careful primer design should keep optimization
time to a minimum. It worked well for me when I de-
signed primers in a way that the reverse primers had a
1-2 C lower melting temperature and higher concentra-
tion than the forward primer.
’This should keep competition between the two allele-
speciﬁc reverse primers high. I did not introduce delib-
erate mismatches into the primer sequence as Li et al.
did (attached paper). However, as I was working

Software coalescentSimulation
Dear all,
We are pleased to announce the release of msms ( http:/-
/www.mabs.at/ewing/msms/ ). Msms is a coalescent
simulation program for a structured population with se-
lection at a single diploid locus. The program includes
the functionality of the simulator ms to model pop-
ulation structure and demography, but adds a model
for deme- and time-dependent selection using forward
simulations. The program can be used, e.g., to studyhard and soft selective sweeps in structured popula-
tions or the genetic footprint of local adaptation. The
implementation is designed to be easily extendable and
widely deployable. The interface and output format are
compatible with ms. Performance is comparable to ms,
even with selection included.
An open access publication is in press as an appli-
cation note in “Bioinformatics”. Source code and
manuals are provided at the web site of the program

anything about the desired length of the analysis. LVB
makes a ’reasonable’ decision about when to stop.
I would be interested to hear any surprises - pleasant
or unpleasant - about LVB’s performance in compari-
son with other parsimony programs, particularly if you
can send me full details of both analyses and the in-
put alignment (which I will not re-distribute without
permission).

Software
NewVersionFLOCKProgram
FLOCK is designed to unravel genetic structure within
a collection of genotypes, whether pure or admixed. It
is assumed that pure, “source”, samples are not avail-
able. The program may be used to solve the “number
(K) of populations” problem, separate pure and ad-
mixed specimens into K groups (K is known), picture
structural relationships between samples. FLOCK is
a non- Bayesian method and therefore diﬀers substan-
tially from previous clustering algorithms. Its working
principle is repeated re-allocation of all collected speci-
mens (total sample) to the k subsamples. The number
of re-allocations until convergence typically stands be-
tween ﬁve and ten. The method was published as:
Duchesne P, Turgeon J (2009) FLOCK: a method for
quick mapping of admixture without source samples.
Molecular Ecology Resources 9: 1333-1344
A new version (2.0) is currently available. FLOCK
now signals by red printing all P Values that exceed
the Bonferroni corrected threshold (0.05/ number of
runs) so that runs that are not validated by alloca-
tion number tables are easily identiﬁed. Also, FLOCK
2.0 may be run for a sequence of values of k in a sin-
gle batch process. A separate output ﬁle, named the
plateau record, is now automatically generated to facil-
itate plateau analysis, a powerful tool to estimate K.

Subsampling frozen tissue
Hello all.
I am trying to sub-sample some frozen tissue. I would
like it to stay frozen, and have been searching for an
easy way of obtaining a core to be put directly into
a 2ml cryo tube. Does anyone have a recommendation
about good frozen tissue corers out there, or some other
way of quickly “stamping” out a suitably sized tissue
sample from a -80 frozen sample.
Thank you for the help.
Anders.

ful: evolution, genetics, molecular biology, bioinformat-
ics/computing, chemistry/biochemistry, palaeontology,
archaeology, and anthropology.
1. Environmental Genomics (including 1-2 postdoc po-
sitions) New genomic approaches for Biodiversity stud-
ies of Australian Soils, Water, Grasses, Forensic sam-
ples and Antarctic biota A number of PhD positions areavailable in a large-scale project to apply high through-
put sequencing approaches to the analysis of environ-
mental samples and develop a new range of methods to
perform biodiversity surveys, taxonomic discovery, and
environmental impact reports. The project will employ
multiplexed PCR, 2nd/3rd Gen Sequencing, Bioinfor-
matics and Phylogenetics to develop novel systems for
rapid and accurate biodiversity assessment. Key top-
ics within the project are the analysis of Australian
soils, natural and re-use water supplies, Australian na-
tive grasses, Antarctic biota, and forensic material. A
strong molecular Biology and/or bioinformatics back-
ground is required. The project is a $1M Australian
Research Council-industry partnership.
1-2 postdoc positions will also be available for this
project, and will carry supervisory responsibilities for
the PhD projects. It is anticipated that one position

ButterﬂyComparativeGenomics
Post-doctoral Position at Boston University
A postdoctoral position is available immediately to
work with Sean Mullen on an NSF-funded project to ex-
amine the comparative genomic basis of butterﬂy wing
pattern variation.
Butterﬂies display a massive array of color patterns,
but much of this diversity appears to be a result of
variation in the elements of a conserved wing pattern
ground plan. Consistent with this hypothesis, emerg-
ing research is revealing that the genetic basis of color
pattern mimicry is conserved, at least among closely-
related species. Current work in the lab is aimed
at identifying the genes responsible for color pattern
mimicry in Heliconius, Limenitis, and Papilio butter-
ﬂies using a novel strategy that utilizes bulk segregant
analyses paired with Illumina sequenced RAD tags, ﬁne
mapping, BAC contig sequencing, SNP discovery via
genome resequencing, and array-based SNP genotyp-
ing.
Toward this end, the lab is currently searching for a
post-doc with a strong background in evolutionary ge-
nomics and/or bioinformatics to assist with analysis of
large genomic and population genomic datasets. Signif-
icant opportunities exist for collaborative interactions
with the lab of Marcus Kronforst at Harvard University
as well as with other members of the broader Heliconius
butterﬂy community.
To apply, send a CV, a description of research interests
and experience, and the names, addresses, phone num-bers, and e-mail addresses of three references to Sean
Mullen at smullen@bu.edu or at this address: Depart-
ment of Biology, Boston University, 5 Cummington St.,

Lyon/FRANCE. Evolution of the Mitotic Spindle
Shape
In the context of a Human Frontiers Science Program
(HFSP) grant, a post-doctoral position is open in our
group for 3 years to study the evolution of the mi-
totic spindle shape using the diversity of nematode em-
bryos. This interdisciplinary project involves two other
groups based in Dresden/Germany and Harvard/US
and combines biophysics and cell biology, with evolu-
tionary biology. To carry out this study we will develop
techniques to apply molecular methods, and quanti-
tative light- and electron microscopy to a number of
non-model organisms throughout the nematode phy-
lum. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive model of
how the mitotic spindle is shaped through evolution by
mutation, selection, drift, and cellular biophysics.
Candidates should have research skills/experience in
some or all of the following: molecular biology, cell biol-
ogy, genetics, imaging, programming and bioinformat-
ics, C. elegans biology.
In addition, ideal candidates will be highly motivated
and have a strong interest for evolutionnary questions.Travel between the three groups and close collaboration
will be an integral part of the project.
The lab is located in the Laboratory of Molecu-
lar Biology of the Cell (LBMC) at Ecole Normale
Sup´ erieure (ENS) de Lyon / France http://www.ens-
lyon.fr/LBMC/ENG/web/nav/ in a friendly and very

MichiganStateU Drosophila
EvolutionaryGenetics
A postdoctoral position is available to study the genetic
architecture of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster
in the lab of Ian Dworkin ( https://www.msu.edu/-
˜idworkin/ ) at Michigan State University. The success-
ful candidate will utilize a combination of genetic and
genomic approaches to identify polymorphisms associ-
ated with variation for wing shape, and in particular to
aid in the development and implementation of methods
to describe the shape trajectories of these genetic ef-
fects, and how these genetic eﬀects interact with the en-
vironment. The initial genetic associations will then be
validated using a combination of genetic associations,
linkage, and mapping in large natural populations of
Drosophila, to address the genetic contributions in the
wild. This is part of a larger project to understand the
relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation
and evolutionary change using the Drosophila wing as
a model organ. The position is part of a collaborative
project involving Ian Dworkin (Michigan State Univer-
sity), David Houle (Florida State University), and Isaac
Salazar-Ciudad (Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona).
Primary responsibility of this position will be in per-
forming and validating the genetic associations, includ-
ing phenotyping, genotyping and analysis of the genetic
associations. The winning candidate will also collabo-
rate with a larger team to compare models to empirical
results, aid in reﬁning the model, and use it to make
evolutionary predictions, which will be tested empiri-
cally using artiﬁcial selection on wing shape. Prefer-58 EvolDir August 1, 2010
ence will be given to candidates with a PhD in quanti-
tative or statistical genetics, the statistical analysis of
shape (geometric morphometrics) or Drosophila devel-
opmental genetics, with some experience in statistical
programming (i.e. using R, SAS or Matlab); and a
desire to fuse developmental, genetic and evolutionary
approaches to fundamental questions about the rela-
tionship between genotype and phenotype.
The position is for an initial period of two years, and
may be extended for an additional two years. The Post
Doc will be among an exciting group of Evolutionary
biologists ( http://eebb.msu.edu/index.php ), and asso-
ciated with the larger BEACON center for the study
of Evolution in action ( http://www.beacon.msu.edu/ ),
providing an exciting and dynamic working environ-
ment.
Applications should be submitted as a single pdf ﬁle
and include a curriculum vitae, a summary of research
accomplishments and future research objectives, and
the names and contact information for at least two pro-
fessional references (and preferably three). Review of
applications will begin July 30th, 2010 and continue
until a suitable candidate is identiﬁed. Application ma-
terials should be sent electronically to Ian Dworkin (id-
workin “at” msu “dot” edu).

Montpellier PetrelKinRecognition
Postdoc position (24 months) available immediately in
Montpellier, France
We are looking for interested junior researcher, who is
highly motivated for an unusual research challenge:
Chemical characterisation of individual and species
olfactory signatures in petrels (procellariiformes
seabirds).
The candidate should be able to integrate himself in
diﬀerent scientiﬁc and cultural environments. She/he
has some background in gas-chromatography and
mass spectrometry techniques preferably for analysing
volatiles organic compounds. Candidates with a back-ground in insect chemical communication systems are
also welcome. The candidate should be ready to travel
to Kerguelen Islands, subantarctic, for ﬁeldwork. Con-
sequently, an interest and motivation to work both in
a laboratory (for gas-chromatography and mass spec-
trometry), and in the ﬁeld (in Subantarctic, to col-
lect samples and perform behavioural experiments), are
needed. The candidate should have some experience
in ﬁeld work in the wild (conceiving behavioural ex-
perimental protocols, sampling protocols etc). A good
knowledge in bio-molecular work for genetics is also
welcome. The ﬁrst step of the project starts from the
data recently obtained by one of our PhD student. The
compounds produced by the uropygial gland (the main
gland in birds), and those found on feathers show that
in petrels it exist a chemical badge identifying species,
sex, and individual. We are interested in analysing now
the actual odour of the birds, sampling the air around
the individual, and to show whether i) the individual,
species, and sex badges still exist, ii) it exist a “family
odour” identifying kin related birds. The second step of
the project will be based on the data about the petrels’
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) that one of
our postdoctoral students is currently obtaining. The
candidate will try to link the personal odour of a bird
with its MHC characteristics, to explore the hypothesis
that MHC drives petrels’ mate choice as it happens in
mice.

The soybean aphid is a serious invasive insect in North
America, having ﬁrst appeared in 2000. However, very
little is known in regards to molecular interactions be-
tween insect and plant, speciﬁcally the genomics of
adaptation during the invasion as well as the evolu-
tion of soybean aphid populations that have overcome
resistance in host plants. The release of the pea aphid
genome provides an extraordinary resource for under-
standing aphid adaptation, and recent soybean aphid
molecular resources developed by our laboratory and
other collaborators will provide a framework for under-
standing the genetic factors involved in aphid adapta-
tion. This position will speciﬁcally focus on the genetic
and transcriptomic interactions among soybean aphids,
bacterial endosymbionts and soybean hosts. Additional
work will include comparative evolutionary genomics
between the soybean aphid and other important aphid
species. Candidates for this position should have a
strong record of accomplishment in the areas of evolu-
tionary genetics and genomics, molecular biology, and
insect-host plant interactions, with emphasis on tran-
scriptomics, gene expression and next-generation se-
quencing technologies. Lab experience with gene ex-
pression, molecular biology techniques and bioinformat-

culture Division, Department of Genetics, Stellenbosch
University with the project title “Genetic improvement
of the abalone Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the shores of South Africa and is the only one of
the ﬁve endemic species that is commercially exploited.
Haliotis midae displays a very slow growth rate, tak-
ing two to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an
obstacle for proﬁtable farming and global competitive-
ness. In order to increase the productivity and the prof-
itability of the commercial abalone industry, a research
program has been designed which makes use of mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. Two key outputs of this program for which
two postdoctoral positions are available include: 1) The
production of a transcriptome sequence of Haliotis mi-
dae utilizing next generation sequencing technologies
including the Illumina Genome Analysis platform and
the GS FLX platform and utilizing this for amongst
others marker development. 2) The generation of com-
prehensive linkage maps and identiﬁcation of QTLs uti-
lizing microsatellite and SNP markers.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for: 1) Bioinformatic data analysis within this frame-
work. This will include developing an in-depth under-
standing of tailored genomic analytical software pack-
ages for EST, transcriptome and gene expression anal-
ysis in order to conduct research and provide post-
graduate students with bioinformatics support; keeping
abreast of new developments in the areas of bioinfor-
matics, transcriptome analysis and abalone research;
the maintenance of a comprehensive sample tracking64 EvolDir August 1, 2010
system; assisting laboratory staﬀ and students with
their research data output requirements. 2) Link-
age and QTL mapping analysis within this framework.
This will include utilizing currently available marker
and data resources as well as initializing further link-
age and QTL mapping design; providing postgraduate
students with data analysis support; keeping abreast of
new developments in the areas of linkage mapping, QTL
mapping and abalone research in general; the mainte-
nance of a comprehensive sample tracking system.
Minimum requirements: 1) PhD with specialization in
Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Genetics, Genomics or
a closely related discipline. Candidates should have a
strong computational background (DNA sequence anal-
ysis, evolutionary genetics/biology and gene expression
data analysis) and proﬁciency in relevant software pack-
ages. 2) PhD with specialization in Biotechnology, Ge-
netics, Genomics or a closely related discipline. Candi-
dates should have a strong computational background
(DNA sequence analysis, linkage mapping, QTL map-
ping) and proﬁciency in relevant software packages.
Recommended requirements: Proven experience with
SNP analyses (bioinformatic or mapping analysis).
Project management experience; excellent organiza-
tional and communication skills; proven ability to set
deadlines and meet milestones.
These positions are available for 2 years with the pos-
sibility of extension. Commencement of duties as soon
as possible but no later than November 2010.

CuticularProteinEvolution
UGeorgia. cuticular proteins
Two NIH-funded postdoctoral positions are available
to learn more about the functions of cuticular proteins
(CPs) in Anopheles gambiae at the University of Geor-
gia, Athens.
An. gambiae devotes almost 2% of its protein cod-
ing genes to structural cuticular proteins. These pro-
teins are the main constituents of structures that form
the interface between the insect and its environment.
We have already learned that some of these genes are
found on chromosomes in clusters of almost identical
genes; others are single copy. Analysis of these clus-
ters challenged standard evolutionary models of gene
duplication. (Cornman and Willis, 2008. Extensive
gene ampliﬁcation and concerted evolution within the
CPR family of cuticular proteins in mosquitoes. Insect
Biochem. Molec. Biol. 38:6612-676.)
Comparison of the cuticular protein complement
in Anopheles to that in other arthropods raises
some intriguing evolutionary questions. Why should
mosquitoes have about 50% more CP genes than
Drosophila, and about 5 times more than Apis? Is CP
gene number related to life style or taxonomic posi-
tion? Should identiﬁcation of orthologs require shared
expression patterns in addition to sequence similarity?
Do common mechanisms account for the gene ampliﬁ-
cation seen in diﬀerent CP families in diﬀerent insects?
What is the source of the CP gene families that are
found exclusively in arthropods?August 1, 2010 EvolDir 67
We already know the temporal expression patterns of
all and the spatial expression patterns of many of the
CP genes in Anopheles. Some of this work, in the con-
text of what is known about CPs of other species is
discussed in: Willis, 2010. Structural cuticular pro-
teins from arthropods: Annotation, nomenclature, and
sequence characterization in the genomics era. Insect
Biochem. Molec. Biol. 40:189-204.
Future work has the following goals:
To learn whether expression of CP genes of adults can
change in response to a blood meal or desiccation using
next generation sequencing.
To locate carefully selected individual CPs in the cu-
ticle using secondary antibodies labeled with colloidal
gold on ultrathin sections.
To use RNAi technology to establish the necessity of
speciﬁc CPs.
To determine the extent to which diﬀerent CPs have
diﬀerent aﬃnities for chitin and/or deacetylated chitin
and for each other using tandem mass spectrometry
to identify proteins serially extracted by increasing
strength of solubilizing agents.
To use these results to understand the evolutionary pro-
cesses at work in shaping the cuticulome of diﬀerent
insects.
Applicants must have a background in basic molecu-
lar techniques and a desire to move beyond annotation
and gene identiﬁcation to learn how particular proteins
function to construct this formidable vector.

willis@cb.uga.edu. To apply send her your CV, con-
tact information for three references and a cover letter
explaining your interest in this area of research.

DrosophilaGenitaliaVariation
The Macdonald lab at the University of Kansas seeks
postdoctoral applicants to study the genetic basis of
morphological variation in Drosophila genitalia. This
NIH-funded project aims to characterize the QTL and
QTN responsible for variation in the shape of the pos-terior lobe, a structure that appears to be under sexual
selection. The project will expand on our previous work
(Genetics 1999, 153:1683) as well as classic genetic stud-
ies by Jerry Coyne and Cathy Laurie to resolve the loci
underlying between-species variation for this trait (see
Evolution 1983, 37:1101 and Genetics 1996, 142:1129).
In addition we will employ association mapping, and
a panel of multiparent advanced intercross lines being
created as part of another NIH grant, to identify the
loci contributing to intraspeciﬁc trait variation within
D. melanogaster.
The position requires a record of published, peer-
reviewed research in areas related to popula-
tion/quantitative/statistical genetics, and would suit
an individual who is comfortable with microscopy and
dissection. A basic knowledge of analytical methods
(e.g. Unix, Perl, R) would also be helpful given the
large genotype/phenotype datasets we typically deal
with.

scribing your interest in the position.

ULeeds AntGeneticDiversity
Postdoctoral Research Assistant position, University of
Leeds Project: Genetic diversity and the neurobiology
of division of labour in ants
A 24 month, ﬁxed-term, EC-funded Postdoctoral Re-
search Assistant position is available in the research
group of Dr. William Hughes at the University of
Leeds. The project will investigate the neurobiology of
division of labour in genetically diverse ant colonies andis in collaboration with Dr. Marc Seid (University of
Scranton and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute).
The discovery and characterization of neuromechanisms
that mediate genotypic diﬀerences in behaviour is a pre-
mier paradigm in biology today. The diﬃculty in ﬁnd-
ing deﬁned answers rests in the complexity of confound-
ing factors (environment, individual behavioural ﬂexi-
bility, genotypic variation and polygenetic traits) and
the limited sample size for comparison. This project
will use social insects to overcome these issues. It will
use leaf-cutting ants as the model species, because the
colonies of these ants contain genetically diverse indi-
viduals and exhibit genetic inﬂuences on behavioural
specialization. Microsatellite genotyping will be used
to characterize the genotypic make-up of behaviourally
specialized ants. The neuroanatomical and neurochem-
ical diﬀerences between these ants will then be exam-
ined to establish the neuromechanisms underpinning
genetic variation in division of labour. Ant brains will
be assayed utilizing serial sectioning for brain morphol-
ogy and immunocytochemistry for direct measurement
of biogenic amine analysis. This project will help reveal
the neuromechanisms governing genotypically derived
behaviours.
You should have a ﬁrst degree and PhD in a relevant
subject, an excellent publication/results record for your
career stage, and research experience in neurobiology.
You should be hard working, self-motivated and able to
work both independently and as part of a team. Re-
search experience with social insects, animal behaviour
and molecular ecology would also be advantageous.
The position is available from 1 September 2010, comes
with a generous salary (euro 54,300-euro 81,400 gross
per annum, depending on experience) and travel al-
lowance. The position is open to all nationalities, but
some nationality/geographic restrictions apply. For fur-

of human populations using genetic data. Link with
environmental changes.
DNA polymorphism data allow the inference of some
aspects of the history of human populations. Various
methods have been developed, in particular coalescent-
based methods, which allow detecting demographic
processes, such as migration or population growth
and inferring their chronology, using genetic polymor-
phism within DNA sequences, SNPs and microsatel-
lites. Other methods based on linkage disequilibrium
can bring complementary knowledge on these events,
allowing in particular the inference of more recent
events. These methods include likelihood method and
Bayesian methods, in particular the recently developed
Approximate Bayesian Computation methods.
The aim of this PostDoctoral position will be to develop
and apply these methods to human populations living
under contrasting life styles: hunter-gatherers, pastoral
nomads, sedentary farmers. The postdoctoral fellow
may work in collaboration with a PhD student on this
subject. The aim will be to assess whether these pop-
ulations underwent demographic events, and also the
timing of such events in order to assess if they are linked
with environmental changes. The available data for this
study will be DNA polymorphism data available in pub-
lic databases, as well as data sets already available or
under development within our laboratory. These data
sets concern populations of pastoral nomads and farm-
ers from Central Asia, as well as those from hunter-
gatherer (pygmies) and farmers from Central Africa,
two regions that went through strong climatic changes
during the past millennia.74 EvolDir August 1, 2010

Vienna DrosophilaAging
Vienna, Austria: POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN
DROSOPHILA AGING
A postdoctoral research position in the genetics of
Drosophila aging is available in the group of Thomas
Flatt at the University of Veterinary Medicine (Depart-
ment of Biomedical Research, Institute of Population
Genetics), Vienna, Austria. The postdoc position is
funded by a grant from the Austrian Science Founda-
tion (FWF) and will be for three years.
This research project will focus on the identiﬁcation
of the molecular basis of the trade-oﬀ between re-
production and lifespan in the fruit ﬂy, Drosophila
melanogaster, a powerful genetic model system. In
many organisms, from fruit ﬂies to humans, reproduc-
tion shortens lifespan, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown (see Flatt & Promislow 2007 in Sci-
ence). Experiments in C. elegans suggest that hor-
monal signals from the gonad aﬀect longevity (Hsin &
Kenyon 1999 in Nature), and we have recently found
that germline ablation extends lifespan and aﬀects in-
sulin signaling in Drosophila (Flatt et al. 2008 in
PNAS). However, the details of this systemic regula-
tion of lifespan by the reproductive system remain un-August 1, 2010 EvolDir 75
clear. In our project we are interested in dissecting
the hormonal and metabolic mechanisms that modu-
late the reproduction-longevity trade-oﬀ. By employing
mutant and transgene analysis, genetic manipulation of
the gonad, epistasis experiments, metabolic measure-
ments, and hormonal manipulations we will examine
the endocrine mechanisms whereby signals from the re-
productive system modulate adult longevity and phys-
iology.
We are seeking a talented, independent, hard-working
and self- motivated young biologist with good social
skills. The successful candidate will have a Ph.D. and
a strong background in genetics and molecular biol-
ogy using the Drosophila system. Some background
in the biology of aging, evolutionary biology, and/or
endocrinology would be ideal, but is not required. The
working language in the laboratory is English, so the
candidate should be proﬁcient in spoken and written
English. German skills, although helpful, are not es-
sential. The initial appointment will be made for one
year, with a possible extension to up to three years.
The annual salary is 56,110 Euro (before tax). The po-
sition is available as of now, but the starting date is
negotiable.
In a 2009 world-wide survey by the William M. Mercer
Institute, Vienna ranked ﬁrst world-wide in terms of
standards of living. Vienna is a beautiful, historical yet
modern city, located in the heart of Europe, close to the
Alps and to major cities like Munich, Zurich, Prague,
and Budapest. Being famous for its concert sites, opera
houses, theathers, museums, and coﬀee shops, Vienna
also provides great outdoor activities, such as sailing
on the Neusiedler See, ice skating, biking and hiking in
the Viennese woods and the nearby Alps. Moreover,
the city has a wide range of great restaurants, bars,
wineries, cinemas, clubs, libraries, galleries, and art col-
lections. The Vienna area is also an exceptional and
highly international research environment. Four major
life science universities and three world-class research
institutes (GMI, IMBA, IMP) provide a dynamic and
interactive setting. Vienna hosts an active Drosophila
community, and the onsite availability of the Drosophila
RNAi center (VDRC) provides a great opportunity for
functional Drosophila work. In population genetics and
evolutionary biology, the Vienna research area also pro-
vides excellent prospects, due to a growing number of
evolutionary research groups.

Course Description: In medicine and agriculture, man-
aging evolution is commonplace. Breeders of domesti-
cated animals and plants have steered evolution for mil-
lennia, whereas during past decades, attempts to avoid
resistance evolution has become a major issue in both
human health and agriculture. In dealing with wild
populations, awakening to contemporary evolution has
just started. Yet there is little doubt that humans are
the greatest evolutionary force of modern times. Wher-
ever humans are present, pristine habitats are absentor rare, and even the most remote places are inﬂuenced
by climate change and pollutants. Humans transport
animals and plants to novel environments. Populations
that are resources to humans may have humans as their
primary predator or herbivore. All these changes have
evolutionary implications, and understanding them is
an important task in managing and conserving the en-
vironment.
The course is an opportunity to bring together young
and experienced scientists with various backgrounds in
evolutionary ecology. The course aims to present the-
ory and techniques, statistical and modeling, to mea-
sure human-induced evolution in marine, freshwater,
and terrestrial environments, covering topics from the
eﬀects of environmental degradation and noise pollu-
tion through to selective removal of individuals (hunt-
ing). The course will suit both experienced postdocs
and doctoral students curious in expanding their quan-
titative skills.
Intended audience: The course will be of interest
to those working on organisms spanning both terres-
trial and aquatic systems in evolutionary ecology, ﬁsh-
eries, behavioral ecology, life history theory (includ-
ing exploitation-induced and contemporary evolution),
wildlife biology, and conservation biology.August 1, 2010 EvolDir 77

Oct13-15
The National Institute for Mathematical and Biologi-
cal Synthesis (NIMBioS) is now accepting applications
for its “Fast, Free Phylogenies: HPC for Phylogenetics
Tutorial” to be held Oct. 13-15, 2010, at NIMBioS.
Objectives: This tutorial focuses on how to use Tera-
Grid, the CIPRES Portal, the iPlant Discovery envi-
ronment, university clusters, and other typically free
HPC resources for phylogenetic analysis. The tutorial
is geared primarily toward biologists (including stu-
dents, postdocs and faculty) who are at least moder-
ately experienced with phylogenetic analysis and who
have datasets to run but who are typically running anal-
yses on their own desktops, though other researchers,
such as statisticians or mathematicians working in phy-
logenetics, are encouraged to apply. Learning can be
enhanced for people applying as a team (such as a
pairing of a biologist and a statistician who collabo-
rate in their work). Accepted students will have the
option of receiving instruction in basic unix usage via
webinar and self-paced online resources before the ac-
tual workshop, so lack of experience in this area should
not be a barrier. Instructors and/or organizers include
Eric Carr (NIMBioS); Jim Ferguson (National Institute
for Computational Sciences, Univ. of Tennessee/Oak
Ridge National Laboratory); Susan Holmes (Stanford
Univ.); Brian O’Meara (Univ. Tennessee); Alexis Sta-
makatis (Technical Univ. of Munich); Dan Stanzione
(Texas Advanced Computing Center/iPlant); and Bob
Thomson (Univ. California Davis). Tuition is covered
by NIMBioS and applicants may also request travel and
lodging support.
Location: NIMBioS at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville
Co-sponsors: NIMBioS, iPlant, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory

Plon Germany EvolutionaryGenetics
PhD STUDENT WORKSHOP ON ’EVOLUTION-
ARY GENETICS’ IN PL ¨ON, GERMANY
The newly established working group (GEN-AG) ’Evo-
lutionary Genetics’ of the German Society of Genetics
organizes its ﬁrst workshop from 28 September to 1
October in Pl¨ on, Germany. The workshop will take
place at the Kappelsberg Youth Hostel in Pl¨ on, North-
ern Germany. The venue is located very beautifully
and is in close vicinity to the Max-Planck-Institute of
Evolutionary Biology.
The workshop aims to establish a network of young
scientists who work in the German-speaking countries
and use theoretical or empirical approaches to study
evolutionary genetic questions ranging from genes to
ecosystems. Each participant will have the opportu-
nity to present his or her work in 20 min talks or in
a poster session. Three invited speakers will provide
an overview of diﬀerent ﬁelds of evolutionary genetics.
In addition to the classical program, the workshop will
include two so-called ’unconference’ sessions, which are
self-organized sessions by the participants.
Further information on the workshop, the program and
the registration can be found at the following website:
http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/ ˜ harr/home.html The
workshop fee be EUR 170.- for a single room and
EUR 150.- (per person) in a double room. These
costs include all meals. Student members of the GFG
(Gesellschaft f¨ ur Genetik) will be reimbursed for the ac-
commodation, but not for the food (which costs EUR
60.-), when registering with the GFG BEFORE reg-
istering for the meeting. A membership form can be
downloaded from the website above.

Switzerland Speciation Aug29-Sep4
2
We are still considering applications for our Speciation
Summer School until next Sunday, 4 July.
This is an ESF-funded summer school “Methods in Spe-
ciation Research”, taking place August 29 to September
4, 2010 in Switzerland.
The program can be found at http://-
www.eawag.ch/lehre/phd/schools/frospects/-
practical/course scheme.gif The school is part of
the European Science Foundation Networking Pro-
gram Frontiers in Speciation Research (FROSpects)
and is open for PhD students, early stage Postdocs
and exceptionally well qualiﬁed MSc students. Venue
is the EAWAG Center of Ecology, Evolution & Biogeo-
chemistry (CEEB) in Kastanienbaum on the shores of
Alpine fjord Lake Lucerne.
Speciation research is currently one of the most vibrant
ﬁelds in evolutionary research. Its success became pos-
sible because of advances in empirical methods, con-
cepts and theory building in population genetics and
evolutionary ecology. We are now in the early stage
of yet another wave of advance, associated with the
genomics era. Studying speciation is a deeply inter-
disciplinary endeavor that often requires good under-
standing of very many diﬀerent concepts and methods
in ecology, genetics and evolution. This makes speci-
ation research sometimes more diﬃcult to access for
young scientists than more disciplinary research ques-
tions in ecology and evolution. In this summer school
we want to introduce graduate students to the ways
experienced and successful speciation researchers inte-grate concepts and methods from ecology, genetics, ge-
nomics and behavioural biology in an attempt to elu-
cidate causes, mechanisms and consequences of, and
constraints to speciation.
The course, taught by an international team of estab-
lished speciation researchers, will provide state of the
art overviews of major topics, as well as ﬁrst hand in-
sights into speciﬁc issues. In four mornings Roger But-
lin (U Sheﬃeld), Scott Hodges (UC Santa Barbara),
Catherine Peichel (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Centre) and Glenn-Peter Saetre (CEES Oslo) will teach
empirical lecture modules. Latest developments in spe-
ciation theory will be taught in a ﬁfth lecture mod-
ule by Sander van Doorn (U Bern). In the afternoons
we will oﬀer workshops and excursions to speciation
study sites. These and a series of evening spotlight-
on-research lectures will be taught by Elena Conti
(U Z¨ urich), Martine Maan (U Bern, Eawag), Walter
Salzburger (U Basel), Ole Seehausen (U Bern, Eawag),
Arjun Sivasundar (U Bern), Piet Spaak (Eawag) and
Alex Widmer (ETHZ). The class size will not exceed
25 students and students will have ample opportunity
to interact with teachers and staﬀ throughout the week.
We provide students with travel grants up to Euro 300,-
, free on-site accommodation and meals.

York EvolutionaryMorphometrics
Oct11-14
The Hull York Medical School Centre for Anatomicaland Human Sciences (CAHS) will host a four day work-
shop in York 11-14 October 2010
The statistical study of morphological evolution went
through a revolution during the last decades with the
introduction of geometric methods for shape analysis.
Geometric morphometrics (GMM) has now become an
essential tool for the quantiﬁcation of biological shape,
being widely used in many areas of evolutionary biol-
ogy, including quantitative genetics, evo-devo and phy-
logenetic comparative studies of shape and function.
The course is aimed at postgraduates who already have
some insight into GMM but may not have yet used
these methods. During the four days of the course the
basics of geometric morphometrics will be covered and
key multivariate morphometric methods reviewed. Fre-
quent examples will be presented using available GMM
software and students will gain experience in using dif-
ferent software tools during the course of each after-
noon’s practical sessions using datasets we will provide.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.82 EvolDir August 1, 2010
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
