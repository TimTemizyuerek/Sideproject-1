2019 International Congress of OdonatologyJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 3
For the rst time since 1999, the International Congress
of Odonatology will be held in the United States. This
is a great opportunity to engage with researchers from
around world studying Odonata. The 2019 ICO will
be held in Austin, Texas in the southern US from July
14-19th. Austin is a great destination for dragonies and
damselies with 116 species known from the Austin area
and 245 species in Texas! The Sunday night icebreaker
and all the meetings will take place in downtown Austin
on Lady Bird Lake at the 2nd oor of the Palmer Event
Center. On Wednesday night, our Congress Dinner will
take place within walking distance from the Palmer
Event Center, on boats touring Lady Bird Lake where
we'll watch the famous Mexican free-tailed bats emerge
from the Congress Street Bridge, the largest urban bat
colony in the world.
To make cost more exible, the mid-conference trip
will now be an optional Friday local eld trip. We will
take you to some of the hotspots for dragonies in the
Austin area. The post-congress trip will travel to the
Rio Grande Valley in south Texas to see some of the
Neotropical fauna that just makes it into the United
States.
Additional details are available on the congress website,
https://worlddragony.org/meetings/ico2019/. Topics
likely on the program will include: Odonata Without
Borders, Los Odonatos de Mxico, Natural History of
Odonata, Odonate Conservation, Citizen Science as a
Tool for Odonate research and Outreach, Identication
of Nymphs and digitizing collections.

Recent observations strongly suggest that changes inmaternal stress signalling can lead to altered develop-
ment in ospring and changes in ospring physiology
across evolutionary lineages. In mammals, studies sug-
gest that maternal exposure to environmental stress
during pregnancy can lead to an increased risk of a
variety of pathologies in later life including diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, depression and anxiety.
This new conference will bring together scientists work-
ing on foetal programming and developmental origins
of health and disease in humans and animals, with
ecologists and evolutionary biologists, to compare and
contrast mechanisms of intergenerational change in di-
verse organisms, to help us understand how the maternal
environment contributes to developmental programming
and disease susceptibility.

Helsinki TreeSelection Jul19-24
We would like to invite submissions to our symposium
held during the International Congress of Entomology
(ICE 2020) from July 19th - 24th, 2020 in Helsinki, Fin-
land, entitled, *\Exploiting host-location behaviors and
host-plant resistance to manage invasive woodborers".*
International trade has increased the rate at which wood-
boring insects are being introduced into novel habitats.
The lack of coevolutionary history with potential host
plants, and escape from natural enemies has caused
these non-native insects to become ecological and eco-
nomic threats in their new ranges. Identifying patterns
in host-location behaviors by woodborers and their nat-
ural enemies, as well as within mechanisms of resistance
by these plants to attackers, can lead to management
practices that reduce the success of colonization and
increase mortality of woodborers in novel habitats.
The goal of this symposium is to spur discussion re-
garding the theory and application of maintaining ro-
bust populations of trees that are resistant to attack by
woodboring beetles. This task requires crosstalk among
researchers that study host location by woodborers and
their natural enemies, as well as those that study plant
defense, ultimately leading to the selection of popula-
tions of trees that minimize damage and reduce the
likelihood of outbreaks of woodboring beetles. We are
looking for researchers that are currently conducting
research in these topic areas to present and provide
further insights.
*Topics of interest include*:
-Theoretical or synthetic presentations on: plant defense
against woodboring insects and host-location by natural
enemies
-Host selection cues used by woodborers and their natu-
ral enemies, including but not limited to: cues that are
chemical, visual, and tactileJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 7
-Mechanisms of resistance used by host trees: antibiosis,
antixenosis, and/or tolerance
-Patterns in coevolved resistant traits and lack of those
mechanisms in novel hosts

Cichlid Science 2019- Madrid
Dear colleagues, The 6th Cichlid Science meeting will
take place from September 9-12 at the Botanical Garden
in Madrid, Spain.
The main goal of the meeting is to bring together scien-
tists from various research elds studying cichlid shes.
Researchers from related elds are encouraged to par-
ticipate.
The previous meetings in Basel (2010), Leuven (2012),
Bangor (2013), Graz (2015) and Prague (2017), included
dierent lines of research of the cichlid biology such as
speciation, adaptive evolution, behavioural and para-

AGU 2019 session: Putting 'Dark Matter' Biodiversity
on the Map
For those of you whose work sits at the intersection of
molecules and morphology, please consider submitting
an abstract to a session at the 2019 AGU meeting in San
Francisco that GBIF and our partners are organizing.
Session B091. Putting 'Dark Matter' Biodiversity on
the Map: Crosslinking Metagenomics, Phylogenetics
and Specimen Occurrence Data Infrastructures to Ad-
vance Scientic Understanding and Policy Relevance of
Cryptic Biodiversity [1]
Many organisms like insects, prokaryotes, fungi and
viruses, lack formal Linnaean scientic names, inhab-
iting a huge gap between described species and true
global biodiversity. These 'dark taxa' are essential to
the biosphere, but limited knowledge of their distri-
bution relegates them to the shadows of research and
protection policies.
Advances in DNA sequencing and comparative data
libraries enable observation and placement of such or-
ganisms into operational taxonomic units or directly in
the tree of life without Linnaean names.
Collaboration between several international infrastruc-
ture networks is linking evidence used by biodiversity,
phylogenetics and metagenomics research communities.
This cross-disciplinary eort increases open biodiversity
data on dark taxa, reduces data gaps and biases, and
cost-eectively enhances the value of public infrastruc-
ture investments.July 1, 2019 EvolDir 11
Combining this data with occurrences from collections,
eld surveys and citizen science will open unexplored
research horizons, improve evidence for policy decisions,
contribute toward biodiversity targets and increase sci-
entic understanding of biodiversity.

EvolutionaryGenomics
The Evolutionary Biology Group is recruiting a PhD
student for an NCN-funded project that will investigate
genomic consequences of articial introduction, pop-
ulation expansion and population replacement in the
Trinidadian guppy. The successful candidate will take
part in all parts of the project including sampling sh on
Trinidad and Tobago and analyzing population genomic
data.
BACKGROUND: A major aim in evolutionary biology
is to quantify the eects that demographic history has
had and can have on the patterns and dynamics of dele-
terious and adaptive variation. The project aims at
validating theoretical predictions recently developed in
this eld, especially those related to population expan-
sion and gene ow between species. To address these
questions, we will perform large-scale genomic analyses
of a population of guppies recently introduced into an
area previously occupied only by its sister species. We
will study how deleterious and adaptive variation shape
the genomic landscape of introgression.
JOB DESCRIPTION: The PhD student will work in
close collaboration with project leader (Mateusz Kon-
czal) and a bioinformatician. There will be considerable
exibility in the scope of the students work within the
overall main goals of the project. The student will learn
simple molecular laboratory techniques, analyze popu-
lation genomic data, perform population genomic simu-lations and will have the opportunity to go to Trinidad
and Tobago to help local collaborators in sampling sh.
S/he will be integrated in the vibrant, highly motivated
international research team based at Adam Mickiewicz
University in Poznan, Poland. For more information on
the research group, see https://sites.google.com/site/-
evobiolab/ REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should
hold an MSc degree in biological sciences or computer
sciences and should have a general interest in evolution-
ary biology. Experience with molecular lab techniques
(specically DNA extraction), programming and big
data analyses are desirable though not required.
FINANCING: The position, starting from October 2019
(negotiable), is planned for three years with a stipend
of PLN 4,500 (about 1,050 euro) per month. Extending
this contract for extra two years will be possible with
nancing from local grant agencies.
HOW TO APPLY: Applications should include a letter
with a short description of your research interests, CV,
summary of MSc work and/or other relevant projects.
Future information about the project and application
procedure can be obtained from the project leader via
email: matusz.konczal(a) amu.edu.pl.
Please apply before 20.08.2019

EvolutionOfGeneNetworks
Graduate position: Barcelona Evolution of gene net-
works and the origins of organismal complexity.
1.Basic job and project description:
The position is the Autonomous University of Barcelona
(UAB) and in the Centre de Recerca Matem ~A|tica
(CRM). The CRM is in the UAB campus.
-The main project questions are:
How should gene networks and cell interactions be or-
ganized to lead to biological complexity?
How is such organization achieved in evolution?
How does gene network organization aect variational
properties of the phenotype (e.g. evolvability)?
Any other question of the applicants interest that is
related to the previous questions.
We will use computational models of the genotype-
phenotype map and computational models of evolution
by natural selection to study such questions for the
case of organismic complexity (e.g. anatomy). The
genotype-phenotype maps models we develop are based
on realistic gene network models of pattern formation
and morphogenesis that lead to realistic 3D multicellular
phenotypes.
The position is in Salazar-Ciudad's group and it entails
obtaining a PhD from the UAB.
2. Background of the project:
There is no consensus denition of complexity, yet it is
evident that organisms are complex and explaining such
complexity is one of the most fundamental questions of
biology. Morphological complexity has not increased in
the evolution of all lineages and, in general, it is unclear
whether there is a general trend of increasing complexity
in evolution. Yet, one may ask about the mechanisms
by which such complexity has increased in the lineages
where it has increased. How complexity increases dur-
ing evolution is necessarily related to development: any
evolutionary change in morphology is rst a change in
the development that produces such morphology.
It has been argued that, in spite of the remarkable mor-
phological complexity of organisms, their development is
achieved through a limited number of cell behaviors andtypes of cell interactions. These cell behaviors would be
cell division, cell adhesion, cell death, cell growth, cell
contraction, extracellular signal and matrix secretion,
extracellular signal reception and cell dierentiation.
In addition to cell behaviors, development involves in-
teractions between cells, either mechanical or through
extracellular signalling.
The questions we want to approach in this study are:
how should these interactions and cell behaviors be co-
ordinated to produce complex and robust morphologies?
The question is, then, whether there are some logical
requirements that developmental mechanisms should
fulll in order to lead to complex robust morphologies.
Are there, for example, some requirements at the level
of gene network topology or at the level of cell behaviors
and their coordination during development?
If, as suggested above, pattern transformations in de-
velopment involve a limited set of cell behaviors and
cell interactions, then any mathematical model imple-
menting those and intracellular gene networks should
be able to reproduce, to a large extent, the range of pat-
tern transformations possible in animal development. In
this project we will use one such model, EmbryoMaker
(Marin-Riera et al, 2015)^ a |, to simulate a large num-
ber of possible developmental mechanisms and try to
discover what, if anything, do the mechanisms leading
to robust complex morphologies have in common.
3. Job description
The main tasks of the student include using and mod-
ifying existing models of embryonic development (e.g.
EmbryoMaker) in order to simulate the development
of complex morphologies. These models will be com-
bined with models of evolution, in a population context
with mutation, genetic drift and natural selection on
morphology (see for example Salazar-Ciudad and Marin-
Riera, 2013). he gene networks found to lead to the
development of complex and robust phenotypes in evo-
lution would be analyzed to extract general regularities,

early as August 2019 as follows:
Spiralians are a great group of animals to study evolu-
tion of body plans in part because many spiralian taxa
develop via a stereotypic and likely ancestral cleavage
program. Ultimately, this cleavage program results in
formation of highly diverse body plans with diverse ar-
rangements of nervous systems, e.g. compare annelids
and gastropod mollusks. Research in Dr. Meyer's lab
is currently focused on understanding how the central
nervous system develops in annelids with the goal of
gaining a better understanding of how nervous systems
evolved. The research community that studies evolution
and development of spiralians is rapidly growing and is
very welcoming and collaborative.
The successful applicant will develop a project focused
on molecular control of neural fate specication inthe
annelid Capitella teleta, but this can be expanded to
include other spiralians and dierent avenues ofresearch
depending on the applicant's interests and goals. Pos-
sible avenues of research include analysisof fate speci-
cation via blastomere isolation, genetic manipulation,
and transcriptomic proling. We havea lab colony of
Capitella teleta, and techniques used in the lab includemicroinjection of embryos, qRTPCR, immunohistochem-
istry, imaging of live and xed tissue, quantication of
phenotypes using ImageJ,and gene knockdown and mis-
expression by injection of morpholinos and mRNA. We
are also currentlydeveloping CRISPR/Cas9 gene edit-
ing and single-cell RNA sequencing in C. teleta. There
will be multipleopportunities for career development, in-
cluding mentoring undergraduate and accelerated M.S.
studentsin the lab, participating as a guest lecturer
in courses taught by the PI, and attending national
workshopssuch as the Embryology course at the Marine
Biological Laboratories.
The successful applicant will enter Clark University's
Biology PhD program with an anticipated start date in
late August. Previous experience in molecular biology
and working with marine larvae and/orbioinformatics
is desirable. Additionally, the Meyer lab is interested
in creative, engaged applicants whocan contribute to di-
versity of the academic community, for example via out-

About the group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population ge-
netics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity.
We have recently demonstrated that coding sequences
of cancer tumors not only exhibit positively selected
mutations that drive cancer (www.biorxiv.org/content/-
10.1101/485292v1), but that there exist genes that the
tumor cannot aord to lose to the mutational pres-sure (www.nature.com/articles/ng.3987). In addition
to genes, we have also identied cancer driver loci in
the non-coding part of the genome (www.nature.com/-
articles/s41467-017-00100-x). Both coding and non-
coding selection can act to promote cancer defense mech-
anisms against therapy, which can be unveiled through
the analysis of time-sequence data of cell-free DNA and
of patient survival data.
The group is particularly interested in how the evolu-
tion and survival of cancer cell populations relies on
mutation inux and in the selection inference from al-
lele frequency information. To this end, we develop
mathematical and computational approaches to esti-
mate mutation rates and selection. We use whole-exome
sequencing and whole-genome data repositories to ana-
lyze selection on coding and non-coding sequences. In
addition, we analyze cell-free DNA from tumors and
their temporal evolution in response to therapy. Esti-
mates of the strength of selection in cancer allow for a
prioritization of genes and non-coding regions by their
disease relevance, with the ultimate goal of promoting
therapeutic advances.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling group was estab-
lished in October 2018 and is part of the 'Bioinformatics
and Genomics' program at the CRG in Barcelona, Spain.

Adaptive radiation of cichlid sh in rivers: Evolutionary
genomics of replicated diversication in Neotropical pike
cichlids
PhD position at the University of South Bohemia in
Ceske Budejovice (Budweis, Czech Republic) available
from: July 2019 (negotiable) application deadline: June
5th (revised) scholarship: net income starts at 900 EUR
equivalent (revised) otherwise as described below
More information: https://zoo.prf.jcu.cz/wp-content/-
uploads/2019/05/PhD-position-at-USB-Adaptive-
radiation-of-cichlid-sh-in-rivers.pdf
Project background: Adaptive radiations are often too
rapid for the emergence of new relevant mutations be-
tween successive speciation events and are thus more
likely to utilise standing genetic variation. Hybridiza-20 EvolDir July 1, 2019
tion between species can instantaneously boost genetic
diversity and create novel phenotypes, and thus facil-
itate speciation and adaptive radiation. On the other
hand, the question whether interspecic hybridization
is important as a mechanism that generates biological
diversity is a matter of some controversy due to the
argument that reduced tness would typically render
hybrids an evolutionary dead end.
The model system: Our research group has recently
discovered and introduced an outstanding evolutionary
model of replicated diversication that includes two in-
dependent riverine lineages of a South American cichlid
genus, Crenicichla, inhabiting adjacent river basins (of
the La Plata River) with similar geomorphology. Both
clades show an extremely wide range of morphologies
and coloration patterns tied closely with trophic ecology,
in which the corresponding (and strikingly similar) eco-
morphs from dierent basins have evolved independently.
We have recently demonstrated, based on morphological
tests of similarities, ancestral states and rates of evo-
lution that the replicated ecomorphs arose via parallel
processes of phenotypic and trophic diversication.
Goal of the project: The aim of this project is to bring
new resolution into the study of microevolutionary pro-
cesses of diversication based on whole-genome sequenc-
ing and RAD-seq genotyping. Phylogenomic and mor-
phological analyses will be used to better understand the
biological and environmental factors underlying rapid
speciation with special focus on the role of hybridization.
To achieve full employment of the WGS/RAD data we
will also sequence and assemble a reference genome of
an appropriate congeneric species.
Research team: The student will work in a small team
supervised by Lubomir Pialek and Oldrich Rican. The
project will be conducted in close collaboration with
Jorge Casciotta and Adriana Almirn (National Univer-
sity of La Plata, Argentina), Edward Burress (University
of California, USA), and Milan Malinsky (University of
Basel, Switzerland).
Time and place: The PhD position is available for three
years, starting in July 2019 (starting date negotiable)
at the Dept. of Zoology, Faculty of Science, University
of South Bohemia, Czech Republic.
Applicant's desired qualication: Master's degree in bi-
ological sciences Understanding of the basic principles
of population genetics and molecular evolution

portunities currently available include projects working
with phylogenetic analyses of evolutionary diversica-
tion and spatial distribution of extinction risk in terres-
trial vertebrates as part of the VertLife project (NSF
DEB-1441719), and phylogeography and species delim-
itation in Dusky Salamanders (genus Desmognathus;
DEB-1655737). We maintain active eld-work programs
in Ecuador, Brazil, India, and Sri Lanka.
Applicants interested in systematics, natural history, bio-
geography, and conservation of any amphibian or reptile
group anywhere in the world are welcome. Previous PhD
students and postdocs have worked on extinction risk in
squamates, evolution of sexual-size dimorphism in vipers,
cryptic speciation in tegu lizards, sexual selection on
frog calls, and ecomorphological diversication in snake
communities. Underlying all of these is an emphasis on
biodiversity informatics and phylogenetic comparative
analysis to understand the origins of biodiversity from
the population level to global species-richness.

HouseSparrowFitness
A PhD position is available on Fitness consequences
of IGEs on parental |investment at Imperial College
London, Silwood Park Campus, in collaboration with
the Zoological Society London.
Project Description The knowledge of how interactions
among conspecics feedback into individual behaviour is
crucial to understanding how phenotypic and genotypic
variance is maintained, to understand how selection can
act, and how behaviours evolve. Interacting individuals
can inuence each other's phenotypes and even tness
where the variation of an interacting phenotype in a
population depends on the social environment ' through
indirect genetic eects (IGEs). This concept is simi-
lar to the idea of an extended phenotype, where social
interactions rather than abiotic factors inuence pheno-
types. We recently found in a wild bird population, that
parental care is partly determined by the genetics of the
social partner. This is especially interesting in a trait
with mutual consequences for the interacting partners,
since not only will an individual pass on its genes to
its ospring, but the genes of the mating partner will
also be passed on to the ospring. IGEs in social traits
between mating partners may therefore be responsible
for the maintenance of genetic variance in traits that
aect their mutual tness. This might be one reason for
why we fail to nd a clear response to selection in wild
populations. This PhD will test recent hypotheses on
IGEs in the context of tness to fully understand howparental care can evolve. We have evidence for heritable
variation in tness in the same population, therefore,
some of the recently developed theory will be testable
in this study system, as a rst, in a wild system. |
This project will make use of our long-term data on
behaviour in the wild house sparrows of Lundy island,
which includes detailed, complete social and genetic
pedigrees spanning 20 years. These data will be used in
advanced quantitative genetic modelling. The successful
applicant is also expected to collect behavioural data of
house sparrows. |
Supervison by Dr J Schroeder (Imperial) Dr J Wang
(ZSL)
The project is a collaboration between Imperial College
and the Zoological Society London. The PhD student
will be working mostly on the Silwood Park Campus of
Imperial, located about 25 miles West of Central Lon-
don. Situated in about 100ha of natural parkland, with
over 100 post-graduate students and several world-class
faculty, research interests include evolution, biodiversity
and conservation. The campus contains all the features
one would expect of a leading centre for life sciences re-
search as well as a few additional, unexpected attributes,
such as Silwood Park being recognised as an important
refuge for wildlife. The campus elds include several
Priority Habitats like wet woodlands, acid grasslands,
traditional orchards and parklands. |
Applicants are expected to have to demonstrate an in-
terest in quantitative data analysis, some experience in
eld work and handling of birds or small mammals, and
to be keen to develop new theory. |
Most applicants will have, or be about to obtain, a
(predicted) rst class, or high 2:1 Masters qualication
(MSc, MRes or MSci/MMath) and a 2.1 or higher un-
dergraduate degree. Exceptional students at Bachelors
level without a Masters will also be considered. Relevant
post-graduate experience will also be taken into account.
|
This is the second round of the 2019 round of NERC
funded phd studentships through the QMEE CDT. The
QMEE CDT aims to train the next generation of re-
searchers in Ecology and Evolution with the quantitative
and modelling skills needed to address real-world prob-
lems by connecting theory, data, and practice. The

MosquitoSwarms
PhD Opportunity at Imperial College London through
the NERC Funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Quan-
titative and Modelling Skills in Ecology and Evolution
(QMEE)
Like many other members of the order Diptera,
mosquitoes mate in aerial swarms. Swarming is ini-
tiated by males which make up the majority of swarm
participants with females entering in much smaller num-
bers. It remains unclear whether these swarms are
an example of collective behaviour. Recent work in
Anopheles mosquitoes suggest that movements are co-
ordinated between nearest neighbours, but the extent
to which swarm dynamics are emergent properties of
these interactions is still debated. More recent work on
Aedes mosquito acoustic interactions and male hearing
mechanisms suggest that males are likely communicat-
ing with one another and with females within swarms.
The degree to which these acoustic emissions are the
result isolated interactions (a cacophony) or a method
of coordination (a chorus) are unclear.This project focuses on exploring these acoustic inter-
actions, their relationship with individual and swarm
movement characteristics, and ultimately how these dy-
namics shape the mating success of the Yellow Fever
mosquito, Aedes aegypti. This species is both an im-
portant arbo-virus vector and one of the main targets
of reproductive control releases. The student will work
with experts in sound engineering and data science to in-
vestigate the degree that sound is used in communication
between individuals and whether this communication is
important for swarm formation.
We take advantage of the unique environment oered
by Imperial College London to tackle the technical and
biological challenges this system presents. The student
will be co-supervised by Dr. Lauren Cator (Department
of Life Sciences), Dr. Lorenzo Picilani (Dyson School
of Engineering), and Dr. Robert Endres Data Science
(Department of the Data Science).

I seek 2 motivated Ph.D. students to join the project:
'Ecophysiology of learning: The eects of short- and
long-term changes in ambient temperature on learning
performance in a model songbird', funded by the Polish
National Science Centre (NCN) OPUS grant
Project:Given current increase in climate unpredictabil-
ity and short-term variability, it is particularly impor-
tant to understand the consequences of environmental
variation for cognitive performance. On the one hand,
highly variable environmental conditions could induce
physiological costs that may set limits to cognitive func-
tions. On the other hand, environmental uctuations
could promote cognitive mechanisms responsible for
more versatile behaviors. Those two options could be
reconciled if physiological costs are reduced by pre-natal
programming and/or developmental plasticity. Yet so
far, the research in the eld of environmental dependency
of learning performance and potential for its modulation
at early life stages is scarce. The main aim of the current
project is to study the eect of temperature uctuations
in dierent time scales on learning eciency in a model
songbird, the zebra nch. Specically, we will verify the
following hypotheses:
(i) Highly variable ambient temperature during devel-
opment aects eciency of the learning processes. (ii)
Maternal eects modify the consequences of variable
ambient temperature experienced during development
on the eciency of learning processes. (iii) Mismatch

Description of work:The research team will consist of
PI (Joanna Rutkowska: http://iron2.eko.uj.edu.pl/-

PhD students. The study will be carried out at the
Institute of Environmental Sciences of the Jagiellonian
University in Krakow, on a captive population of zebra
nches established in 2000. It will involve breeding the
birds, cross-fostering eggs, performing basic morpho-
logical measurements, and physiological tests such as
analyses of blood parameters and hormone levels. Both
PhD students will be trained to perform the practical
part of the project, guided in skills needed for a success-
ful scientic career, and encouraged to develop his/her
own ideas.
Position 1) The PhD student will record and analyse
singing performance of fathers/tutors and all of their
male ospring. To assess learning accuracy, the student
will then assess repertoire size and extract repetitions of
each syllable. Dr. Carlos A. Botero (Washington Uni-
versity in Saint Louis) is a collaborator on this project
and he will provide training of song analyses.
Position 2) The PhD student will carry out tests on
learning performance in relation to food acquisition in
juveniles and adults: (i) problem-solving tasks provid-
ing an integrative measure of perception, reasoning and
decision making; and in adults only: (ii) learning asso-

EVOLDIR : JYUFinland.SexEvolTardigrade
PhD Title: Sexual selection in tardigrades: sex-
(in)dependent mechanisms
Duration: January 2020 ' December 2023
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate to
join our new and enthusiastic research group led by Dr.
Sara Calhim, at the University of Jyv askyl a (Finland).
We investigate key themes in reproductive evolutionary
biology using a little studied but charismatic group of
organisms ' tardigrades (a.k.a. water bears).
These transparent, microscopic ( <1mm), eight-legged
animals are well known for their ability to survive ex-
treme stressors in a cryptobiotic (i.e. ametabolic) state.
However, they also have incredibly diverse but largely
unexplored reproductive biology which makes them the
ideal study system to tackle long standing questions
in the eld of sexual selection and reproductive trait
evolution.
Sexual selection is an important evolutionary force that
acts on traits associated with the ability to access mates
and/or fertilizations. It is well established that it can
aect both sexes. However, most research uses study
systems where the traits under sexual selection dier
markedly between the sexes and/or the mechanisms
by which they evolve are confounded by dierent as-
pects of the species' biology (e.g. due to marked sexualJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
dimorphism in morphology, behavior, physiology or life-
history. As a result, male and female phenotypes cannot
be studied simultaneously or in a biologically relevant
comparable way. Tardigrades have little sexual dieren-
tiation, short generation time, and tractable (mating)
behavior and development. Therefore, they are ideally
suited for researching of sex-(in)dependent mechanisms
of sexual selection (i.e. using equivalent measures and
experimental protocols). This PhD project will make a
valuable contribution to the eld beyond increased sci-
entic knowledge, through the development of tools for
quantitative assessment chemical signals and parentage
assignment in this phylum.
Requirements:
A Master's degree in Evolutionary Biology, Ecology or
Molecular Biology. Previous experience with handling
microscopic organisms and/or using chemical or genomic
laboratory and analytical tools are an advantage. The
candidate must show considerable written and verbal
communication skills in English, independent and cre-
ative thinking, and an ability to work collaboratively.

Understanding the evolution of mammal pollination in
the south-west Australian biodiversity hotspot and its
vulnerability to landscape modication
While Australia is a global centre for bird pollination,
there is comparatively little evidence for pollination sys-
tems specialised on mammal pollination. The honey
possum is a specialist nectarivore, endemic to the south-
west Australian biodiversity hotspot, where they were
originally common in sandplain habitats dominated by
Proteaceae and Myrtaceae. While it has long been
speculated that plants may be adapted specically to
pollination by honey possums, this hypothesis has never
been rigorously tested. The initial aim of this project
is to test for specialisation on pollination by honey pos-
sums in members of Dryandra, a clade of Banksia that
exhibits multiple evolutions of the unusual prostrate
owers thought to be associated with mammal pollina-
tion. Secondly, we aim to investigate how resilient this
pollination strategy is to anthropogenic landscape mod-
ication, given that many prostrate Dryandra are rare
local endemics, including in remnant sandplain within
the agricultural region. Finally, we aim to test the role
of specic oral traits such as oral odour, inorescence
position, and rigid oral structure in pollination by
honey possums.
A PhD student is being sought to research the ecology
of potential honey possum pollination systems in Dryan-
dra, with the exibility to investigate issues of either
conservation or oral adaptation depending on interest.
A PhD scholarship for the project is available through
La Trobe University. Suitable PhD students will have:
(i) a Masters or strong rst class honours (ii) a driver's
license (iii) an ability to undertake eldwork in remote
areas (iv) a willingness to undertake eldwork interstate

SexualSelectionPathogensDrosophila
PhD position: the role of pathogens in sexual selection
in Drosophila
A PhD student position is available in Tad Kawecki's
research group at the Department of Ecology and Evo-
lution, University of Lausanne, Switzerland (https://-
www.unil.ch/dee/kawecki-group). The position is open
from September 2019 (negotiable), initially for one year
and extendable for up to three additional years, with
an initial salary of CHF 47,040 (about 42,000 euro) per
year.
I am looking for a PhD candidate to study interactions
between sexual selection and pathogen resistance in the
experimental system consisting of Drosophila and its
bacterial and fungal pathogens. While traits mediat-
ing male sexual success have long been postulated to
indicate \good genes" for pathogen resistance, the ex-
perimental evidence is surprisingly scarce and equivocal.
We have recently found that males that sire ospring
more resistant to a bacterial pathogen are more success-
ful in competition for mates ' but only if the competition
occurs after the males have themselves been exposed to
the pathogen. In the absence of the pathogen, males
carrying \good genes" for resistance are less likely to
win (Joye and Kawecki 2019, Proc R Soc B, royalsoci-
etypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0226). This is
the rst experimental evidence that the link between
genes for resistance and sexual success depends on the
epidemiological context in which sexual selection op-
erates. Building upon this discovery, a new project
funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation will
aim at understanding of the behavioral and physiologi-
cal mechanisms of this phenomenon, its genomic bases,
specicity to the pathogen involved and consequences
for Darwinian tness. The PhD project will be dened
within this framework.
The project will be based on laboratory work with
Drosophila melanogaster. It will involve mate choice
experiments, experimental infections, resistance and t-
ness assays, as well as behavioral and genomic analyses.
The student will be expected to follow the relevant lit-
erature, present their work in seminars and external
meetings. She or he will enroll in the inter-university
doctoral program in ecology and evolution (https://-
biologie.cuso.ch/ecologie-et-evolution) and be expectedto take part in courses and workshops organized by
that program. | A modest contribution to teaching
(as a teaching assistant) is possible against a salary
supplement.
A master degree is required before starting the PhD.
The candidate will have a strong conceptual background
and interest in evolutionary biology and behavior, and
motivation and skills to carry out laboratory experi-
ments with Drosophila. The project will require a good
understanding of experimental design and statistical
analysis, and an ability to work in a research team.
Basic bioinformatic skills and/or some experience with
automatic tracking systems for behavior would be a plus.
All research activities, lab meetings and seminars are
in English. Knowledge of French is not required, but
learning some French would make living in Lausanne
more enjoyable.
Lausanne is a medium-sized city on the shores of Lake
Geneva, surrounded by a wine growing region recognized
as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and within one hour
of the Alps. It oers a great variety of cultural, recre-
ational and outdoor opportunities. The Department

LeidenU BalancedLethalSystem
The Institute of Biology Leiden at Leiden University
and Naturalis Biodiversity Center are looking for
PhD candidates: Untangling the Evolution of a Bal-
anced Lethal System
Project description Balanced lethal systems represent
an evolutionary enigma as they cut reproductive output
in half. Dierent lethal alleles on two distinct forms
of a chromosome compensate each other. Hence, both
chromosome forms, including their linked lethal alleles,
are required for survival. The most illustrious balanced
lethal system is chromosome 1 syndrome, observed in
the genus Triturus (the marbled and crested newts). All
adults invariably possess two forms of chromosome 1,
1A and 1B. Yet, according to the rules of Mendelian
inheritance, 50% of ospring produced is homozygous
(possessing two copies of either 1A or 1B). These ho-
mozygotes die roughly halfway normal embryological
development - half of Triturus embryos never hatch!
All we currently know about chromosome 1 syndrome
derives from classical karyological studies. In two PhD
projects, the candidates will determine the genomic ba-
sis of chromosome 1 syndrome. The topics that will be
addressed are 1) Ancestral reconstruction of Triturus'
chromosome 1 at the point of origin of the balanced
lethal system and distillation of the lethal factors; and 2)
Comparative genomics of the balanced lethal system in
Triturus with related but unaected salamander species.
Key responsibilities As PhD candidate you will be con-
ducting and publishing scientic research in consultation
with your doctoral thesis supervisor. Your key tasks
include:
Execute the scientic research as detailed in the project
description; Publish results in scientic journals and
a thesis; Participate in conferences; Follow the Leiden
University Graduate school programme for PhD candi-
dates.
Selection criteria
Master degree in biology with proven experience in bioin-
formatics; Laboratory skills: DNA/RNA extraction and
library preparation for NGS; A good command of theEnglish language and proven writing abilities; Highly
motivated and capable of working both independently
and as part of a team.

AphidDiSymbioticSystemsEvolution
We are looking for a phd candidate to work on the evo-
lution of di-symbiotic systems in aphids, in Montpellier,
France (start date October 2019, Phd Grant funded for
three years)
Background: Phytophagous insects are an important
part of terrestrial biodiversity. A key factor in their
evolutionary success probably lies in the mutualistic
associations they have established with some intracellu-
lar bacteria. These endosymbionts metabolize some of
the nutrients lacking in their host diet and can be es-
sential for successfully shifting to new ecological niches.
However long-term obligate associations with bacterial
partners have their downsides. Endosymbiotic bacteria
generally exhibit drastic genome reduction in compari-
son with their free-living relatives: this is due to relaxed
evolutionary constraints on genes that are not necessary
for life within the host and genetic drift caused by se-
vere bottlenecks occurring during the maternal transfer
of endosymbionts. This drift leads to the xation of
mildly deleterious mutations and can ultimately alter
endosymbiont genomes and increase host vulnerability
to environmental changes. This process of genome ero-
sion can sometimes be compensated by the recruitment
of a new symbiont that complements the primary one;
such multi-partner endosymbioses have been observed in
several insect lineages. The aim of this thesis is to study
the evolutionary dynamics of a di-symbiotic system in
aphids.
Aphids have established an obligate mutualistic rela-
tionship more than 100 million years ago with a bac-
terium; Buchnera aphidicola, which compensates for
their sugar-rich phloem diet by providing them with
essential amino acids and vitamins. In some aphid
lineages, this mutualistic relationship has evolved into
a tri-partite association in which Buchnera aphidicolais \assisted" by a second bacterial partner that has
been repeated replaced along the evolutionary history
of the aphids (Manzano-Mar ~A^A'n | 2017, Meseguer
et al. 2017). These shifts in symbiotic associations
can be associated with the genome erosion of one the
symbionts (Manzano-Mar ~A^A'n et al. 2018) and fa-
vored by Horizontal Gene Transfers between symbionts
(Manzano-Mar ~A^A'n et al., 2019).
|Using Cinara aphids as a study system, the aim of
the thesis will be to: 1) reconstruct the history of
aphid/endosymbiont associations using phylogenomic
analyzes and cospeciation analyzes ; 2) characterize pat-
terns of molecular evolution in bacterial lineages and
identify the signatures of selection and drift in bacterial
genomes; 3) investigate | phenotypic and intra host
dynamics | of obligate endosymbionts.
|We are looking for a student with a solid background
in phylogenetics and/or evolutionary genomics and a
strong interest in addressing evolutionary questions in
host/symbiont associations. He will be trained in the
comparative genomics of bacterial genomes and tech-
niques for investigating symbiont dynamics within hosts.
|Host laboratory and context: The Phd will be super-
vised by E. Jousselin and A. Manzano- Mar ~A^A'n at
CBGP (Montpellier) He/she will analyze an already ac-
quired dataset (endosymbiont genome data from about
50 aphid species) using phylogenomics.
He /she will join a collaborative network : - Bastien
Boussaud and Vincent Daubin (Univ. Lyon, France) to

InsectAdaptationBiopesticides
We are looking for a PhD candidate at the Nat-
ural Resources Institute to look at the impact,
potential behavioural and physiological adaptations
of benecial insects to biopesticides. | Applica-
tion should be made following link in project de-
tails (https://www.gre.ac.uk/research/study/research-
studentships-and-scholarships). For any other enquiries,
contact |Mandela Fernandez-Grandon on m.fernandez-
grandon@gre.ac.uk. |
Title: Impacts of novel multimodal biopesticides on
benecial |insects
Solutions for the global challenge of food security are
required urgently, particularly those that support sus-
tainable pest control in developing countries where pes-
ticide regulation is weak and broad-spectrum pesticides
are used widely. Dramatic losses to global insect bio-
diversity have received international attention recently
and it is crucial that impacts on non-target organisms
of technologies for controlling pests are minimised. |
Environmentally benign pest control technologies in-
clude entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) and botanical in-
secticides, but these have shortcomings associated with
slow action and low persistence, respectively. How-
ever, this combination pesticide may impact non-target
species that contribute importantly to natural pest reg-
ulation and pollination which are key ecosystem services
in the sustainable intensication of agriculture. |
This project will evaluate the wider impact on the ecosys-
tem of introducing new multimodal biopesticides and
explore physiological and behavioural eects on non-
target organisms. |
Through this project, the student will collect and anal-
yse volatiles compounds associated with EPF. Using
a range of olfactometers and behaviour recording soft-
ware (Ethovision ^A), they will analyse the behaviour of
relevant parasitic wasp species in response to volatiles
associated with the fungus. Training will be provided
on techniques in Chemical Ecology. They will also
investigate physiological adaptations of the insects in
response to fungal infection including measures of sur-
vival and pest control ecacy (attack rate, eclosion
rate) in laboratory and semi-eld experiments. These
are crucial | data for underpinning development ofthese sustainable pest management tools but are unre-
ported in the literature. Within this broader theme, the
student will also be encouraged to develop their own
ideas. | This studentship will run alongside a large
collaborative project led by the supervisory team on
the development of environmentally benign pest control
for UK and Chinese markets. This work may help in-
form the use of sustainable pest control for international
producers and help us learn more about the ecology
and behaviour of pollinators and natural enemies. The
student will be expected to work with the team and the
project may involve travel to China for eld or labora-
tory work. The Natural Resources Institute is now in its
125th year as an internationally recognised in improv-
ing livelihoods across the world (https://www.nri.org/).
This studentship will oer the successful candidate to
be part of this exciting research and the postgraduate
community at NRI. |

PoplarHybridization
A PhD position is available to study adaptive intro-
gression in Poplar with Jill Hamilton at North Dakota
State University, as part of a new NSF Plant Genome-
funded collaboration with Jason Holliday (Virginia
Tech), Stephen Keller (Vermont) and Matt Fitzpatrick
(U of Maryland).
Understanding how interspecic hybridization leads to
the generation of complex adaptive traits across envi-
ronments is a central objective of species management,
particularly considering rapidly changing climates. Nat-
ural Populus hybrid zones provide a living laboratory to
test the impact a long history of natural selection and
weak barriers to reproduction have had on the origins
of adaptations and the maintenance of species barriers.
In addition, Populus has emerged as a model genus for
evolutionary and functional genomic studies on climate
adaptation and comprises several species that have been
developed as feedstocks for bioenergy. The graduate
student will leverage replicate natural hybrid zone tran-
sects between Populus trichocarpa and P. balsamifera
across North America in conjunction with modern se-
quencing (whole-genome resequencing, long and short
reads), large common garden experiments, and novel
computational approaches to study the genomic and
phenotypic consequences of hybridization across envi-
ronments. Broadly this research will ask: (i) how is
introgression arrayed across the genome and landscape?
and (ii) what regions of the genome contribute to hybrid
tness and what are their environmental drivers? This
project will provide the most comprehensive picture
to date of the genomics of hybridization and heterosis
in a tree species, enhancing our understanding of the
relationship between adaptive introgression and tness
across environments.
The ideal PhD student will be prepared to combine
eld-based research monitoring phenotypic trait varia-
tion across replicated common garden experiments with
genomic analyses (whole genome resequencing), and
environmental and spatial data. The ideal graduate
student will have some experience in computational
biology; including population genomics and/or quan-
titative genetics. There is plenty of room to pursue
particular interests in adaptive introgression and the
origin of species barriers depending on the interest and32 EvolDir July 1, 2019
experience of the candidate. The student will be in-
volved in a range of outreach activities associated with
the project, including engaging with collaborator insti-
tutions and ArbNet (based at the Morton Arboretum,
Chicago) to develop educational modules on climate
adaptation using Poplar mini gardens planted across
the United States. The ability to work independently
and a strong background in genomics and computational
skills are needed. Some experience in quantitative ge-
netics, genome-wide association analysis or previous
experience using environmental data to model species
ranges is preferred.

**Three-year PhD position on modeling the evolution of
human cooperation in the context of climate change and
climate extremes.* * Full-time, fully funded position
based in Paris, France. Starting October 1, 2019.
Project summary: Promoting human cooperation to-
wards public goods is particularly challenging, and quan-
titative theory is scarce. We propose to develop general
models for the joint evolutionary dynamics of coopera-tion and social norms, and apply these models to the
problem of cooperation in response to anthropogenic
climate change. Of particular interest is the eect of
environmental uctuations, including extreme climatic
events, with the goal of predicting their eects across
scales of time, space, and social structure. This in-
terdisciplinary project will advance the mathematical
framework of cultural evolution and human coopera-
tion, and yield novel insights into the emergence and
dynamics of cultures of cooperation' in the face of global
environmental challenges.
Key words: Human cooperation. Cultural evolution.
Non-vertical transmission. Transmission bias. Variable
environment. Environmental extremes. Climate change.
Game theory. Adaptive dynamics. Mathematical model-
ing. Nonlinear stochastic processes. Macroscopic limits.

HostParasiteInteractions
Graduate position TrinityCollege-
Dublin.HostParasiteInteractions
A four-year funded PhD position (16,000 per year) start-
ing either Sept 2019 or March 2020 is available at theZoology Department of Trinity College Dublin, on how
host density and diversity aect disease outbreaks, under
supervision of Pepijn Luijckx.
Interested candidates should send: 1) a curriculum vitae
and 2) a cover letter outlining your research interests
and why you would like to do a PhD to: luijckxp@tcd.ie.
Project description The health and economic impact of
recent outbreaks of Cholera, Zika virus and inuenza
underline the urgency of understanding how diseases
spread and transmit. Transmission eciency of many
diseases is related to the density of the host popula-
tions. Lower host densities slow disease spread, until
host densities are insucient to maintain infection. Sup-
port for the existence of such host-density thresholds
under which diseases cannot spread comes primarily
from theory, with only a few empirical case studies.
Considering that this theory is critical for our under-
standing of disease dynamics and forms the basis for
vaccination and culling programs, it is thus surprising
that the existence of host density thresholds has not
been experimentally veried. Moreover, there are ample
reasons why disease dynamics may be more complex
than portrayed by simple theoretical models. Indeed,
dierent assumptions on the genetic diversity of the host
can lead to very dierent disease dynamics and abiotic
(e.g. temperature) or biotic (predation, competition)
factors may either facilitate or impede disease spread.
To better understand how these factors impact disease
outbreak and evolution and to validate the existence
of host density thresholds, the candidate will induce
epidemics under laboratory conditions with a model
host-parasite system (the water ea Daphnia magna
and the microsporidium parasite Ordospora colligata).
Experiments could be supplemented with theoretical
approaches in collaboration with Andrew Jackson (theo-
retician in the Zoology Department), genetic approaches
to gain better insight in the role of host genetics, or eld
experiments, depending on the candidates interests and
strengths.
Requirements - Undergraduate or Masters degree in ecol-
ogy or evolution (or related eld) and a keen interest in
host-disease interactions.
Desirable - Creative, motivated and resilient. - Experi-
ence running large laboratory experiments. - Experience
with aquatic insects. - Knowledge of experimental de-
sign and experience using R. - Willingness to contribute
to laboratory maintenance and animal care. - Capable
of working both independently and as part of a team. -
Procient in written and spoken English.
Research group The candidate will be joining Floriane
OKeee, a PhD candidate starting in September and
Pepijn Luijckx in the waterea@tcd laboratory at the34 EvolDir July 1, 2019
Zoology Department in Trinity College Dublin. The lab
has a keen interest in empirically testing evolutionary
and ecological theories pertaining to disease interactions.
For example, past work has tested underlying assump-
tions of theory on host-parasite evolution (Luijckx et al.
2013 Current Biology), the evolutionary maintenance of
sexual reproduction (Luijckx et al. 2017 PNAS) and how
a warming climate may alter disease outbreaks (Kirk et
al 2018). In addition to the waterea@tcd laboratory
the Zoology Department (https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/)
is home to research groups with expertise in theory (e.g.
thermal scaling, host-parasite models), community ecol-
ogy, parasitology, and aquatic biology providing ample

UBasel PlantAdaptation
PhD position in Plant Adaptation to Climate Change,
University of Basel, Switzerland
A 4-year PhD position (100%) is available in the group of
Plant Ecology and Evolution at the University of Basel,
Switzerland (https://duw.unibas.ch/en/plant-ecology-
and-evolution/). Research in the group focuses on plant
adaptation to spatial and temporal change in climatic
conditions. We estimate the extent to which climate
adaptation is possible, what the sources of evolutionary
constraints are, and how they will aect future species
distribution under scenarios of global warming.
The evolutionary causes of climate niche limits are
poorly known. Theory points to changes in the se-
lection regime and genetic limitations. The selection
regime may be important if environmental gradients
are multivariate or steep in nature. Genetic limits may
arise because of low genetic variation in individual envi-
ronmental tolerances or because of genetic correlations
antagonistic to the direction of selection.
Your tasks: Working with the plant Arabidopsis lyrata,
the student will assess the tolerance of plants to stressful
climatic conditions in greenhouse and outdoors, estimate
genetic variances of tolerance and life history traits, and
study the quantitative genetic and genomic underpin-
ning of tolerance. Fieldwork will be an important part
of the project and take place in eastern states of the US,
in collaboration with local universities.
Your prole: Candidates should have an enthusiastic
interest in plants and their evolution, and a strong back-ground in quantitative thinking, experimental design,
statistical analysis/bioinformatics, and rearing plants.
Applicants must have a university degree in the natural
sciences that allows entrance to a PhD program (ide-
ally in evolutionary biology or ecology), and very good
organizational, analytical, and scientic writing skills.
Applicants should have a driver's license.
We oer: The project is based at the Department of
Environmental Sciences, University of Basel, Switzer-
land. The Department oers a stimulating environment,
including a rich spectrum of research activities in life
sciences (plant ecology, population genetics, evolution-
ary biology, plant physiology and molecular and cell
biology). Students will be enrolled in the PhD pro-
gram of the Z urich-Basel Plant Science Center. Basel
is a mid-sized Swiss city, well connected and oering a
broad range of cultural and recreational activities. Ideal
starting date is October 2019 but is open to negotiation.
Contact: For more information, contact Yvonne Willi
(yvonne.willi@unibas.ch). Motivated applicants should
submit (1) a one-page letter that summarizes interests
and relevant experience, (2) their CV, (3) copies of un-
dergraduate and masters/diploma transcripts, and (4)
contact information of two references (all as a ***single
PDF***) to: franziska.grob@unibas.ch. Applications
are welcome until the position is lled and will be re-

SeaChanges provides state-of-the-art training to forge aJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 35
new generation of interdisciplinary researchers able to
operate at the interface of archaeology and marine biol-
ogy by joining experts from 7 EU leading institutions
in archaeology, zoology, marine ecology & conservation
biology. SeaChanges will pool experts' disparate skills
and experience in an integrated training programme
for PhDs candidates to gain the interdisciplinary under-
standing & skills required fully to realise the potential
of archaeological remains to understand past marine re-
source use, assess past impacts, and use these to inform
the present. The successful candidate will participate
in a Marie Curie international training network and
will work in a highly interactive international environ-
ment with other Marie-Curie PhD students, researchers,
authorities, NGOs and industry.
Candidates with backgrounds in disciplines of Marine
Sciences (including Biology, Ecology, Evolutionary Bi-
ology, Population Genetics/Genomics, Biotechnology,
Zooarcheology, and/or Archeogenetics) are all encour-
aged to apply; each studentship will be developed with
the successful applicant.
The candidates are invited to apply for the project
hosted by the University of Bologna (SeaChanges ESR
12): Exploring the correlations between environmen-
tal/ecological drivers and past/contemporary genetic
diversity of Atlantic and Mediterranean Bluen tuna
populations
Among the many sh species commercially exploited
since prehistoric times, bluen tuna (BFT, Thunnus
thynnus) is both one of the most economically signicant
and one of the most threatened. ESR 12 will explore and
highlight correlations between environmental and ecolog-
ical drivers (including anthropogenic ones) and past and
present genetic diversity of the Atlantic and Mediter-
ranean BFT populations, by measuring (a) the temporal
variation of environmental and ecological proxies and (b)
paleo- and neo-genomic adaptive variation. In order to
resolve such a complex system of factors and processes,
the ESR will take a multidisciplinary approach combin-
ing genomic methods (ancient DNA, paleoproteomics)
with stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. The
availability of archaeological/historical (from c.2,000 to
c.100 years before present) and contemporary BFT indi-
viduals will provide, for the rst time among non-model
animals, data on genome variation on a temporal scale
in the same taxon.
Using genome scan techniques, ESR 12 will evaluate
the eects that environmental disturbances (habitat
changes, pollution, industrial shery exploitation) have
on biological adaptation, through the analysis of the
evolution of structural/functional genomic components
such as adaptive traits. The ESR will use ZooMS forinitial identication/ screening of ancient tuna remains,
expanding this technique to Scombridae for the rst
time via a secondment at the University of Copenhagen.
Stable isotopes analyses, via secondment at Univer-
sity of York, will provide signatures of environmental
and ecological conditions. The student will cooperate
with ESR 15 regarding potential additional ancient sam-
ples from the Black Sea. Supervisors: Fausto Tinti,
Alessia Cariani (Tuna Historical Genetics&Genomics;

& Elisabetta Cilli (Fish archeogenetics; Dept. Cultural
Heritage). Training secondment opportunities: Univer-
sity of York (UK) and University of Copenhagen (DK),
with Prof. Matthew Collins.

UCalgary PacicSalmonEvolution
The Rogers lab at the University of Calgary is currently
looking to recruit a highly motivated MSc student in
Ecology and Evolution to research the ecology of wild
and hatchery-born Pacic Salmon in the Nitinat River
on Vancouver Island, BC. This position would start
September 2019.
Scientic context:
Pacic salmon are vital resources in the ecological and
human communities in which they occur. However,
many stocks of these species have declined from histor-
ical levels due to a combination of factors. A widely
employed strategy within North America to bolster such
stocks is the use of hatchery enhancement. Hatcheries36 EvolDir July 1, 2019
use captured broodstock (breeding individuals) to pro-
duce fertilized eggs which are reared through the egg-
to-smolt (seaward-migrating juvenile) phase and then
released to the wild. Despite their widespread use, the
long-term eectiveness of hatcheries and their eects on
wild sh remains uncertain.
The project:
The project will take place within the context of a larger
NSERC-funded strategic project in which Coho salmon
have been raised under traditional hatchery practices
and under enrichment practices aimed at producing sh
that more closely resemble their wild relatives. Using a
combination of genetic screening and traditional mark-
ing strategies, the fates of these sh can be tracked
towards testing the ecological and genetic consequences
of enhancement. The exact questions addressed by the
MSc project are negotiable but should focus on aspects
of how wild-born Coho and hatchery-born Coho from
both treatments behave (in an ecological sense) in-river.
Potential questions include but are not limited to:
Do juvenile and adult phenotypes vary in association
with enrichment treatment?
Do returning adults from these groups select dierent
microhabitats for spawning, either increasing or decreas-
ing competition?
What are the distributions of individuals from these
groups across the river system, both when returning
and as young before migration to sea?
Do individuals from these groups tend to mate as-
sortively due to common learned mating behaviours?
A eld season sampling adults returning across the Niti-
nat for genetic material is currently being planned for
the 2019 migration (starting November) and should form
the basis of a large component of the project. Lab-based
behavioral and / or physiological experiments involving
young Coho will also be possible. Whatever the nal
experimental design, the MSc student should expect to
work closely with a PhD student and Post-Doc currently
working on aspects of the larger project, as well as our
partners, including the Nitinat River Hatchery, Depart-
ment of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and the Dididaht
and Huu-ay-aht First Nations.
Specics: This project has the potential to be based
out of either the University of Calgary or the Bameld
Marine Sciences Centre. Behavioural and / or physi-
ological experiments on young would be performed at
the BMSC. For either option, extended periods of work
on Vancouver Island should be expected. Although
much of the Nitinat River is accessible by logging roads,
hiking in rough terrain with heavy packs and remotecamping for several days at a time - in a temperate
rainforest - should be expected. This project is fully
funded with a guaranteed $23 000/year in funding for
two years. Associated graduate-level coursework at the
UofC is oered in English only. The ideal candidate
should have a strong and demonstrated interest in ecol-
ogy and evolution, be curious about nature, and be
team-oriented.
More details about the Rogers Lab and graduate
studies in biology at the UofC can be found at
http://people.ucalgary.ca/ ~srogers/ and https://-
bio.ucalgary.ca/graduate respectively.
Candidates should direct questions or applications
including a cover letter, cv, academic transcripts
and the names of two references to Sean Rogers
(srogers@ucalgary.ca). A search will continue until the
position is lled.

*PhD Position in evolutionary mitochondrial physiology
in Montreal**
An opportunity is available for a PhD position in the
research group of Dr Sophie Breton at the Universit e
de Montr eal.Project: Organisms respond to environmental factors
over time in two ways: (i) short-term changes during
their lifetime (*e.g.* epigenetic modications and gene
expression changes) and (ii) long-term changes across
generations, *i.e.* heritable evolutionary responses, re-
sulting in genetically distinct populations ' potentially
even new species. While empirical examples of rapid re-
sponses and evolutionary adaptations involving nuclear
epigenetic variation (in the form of DNA methylation)
and genetic variation (through the evolution of lineage-
specic or adaptive genes or ORFan genes) exist from
a range of animals and plants, the importance of mito-
chondria (the powerhouse of cells) and their genomes
(mtDNA) in promoting adaptation to both short- and
long-term environmental changes using the same mecha-
nisms is still largely unexplored. This major knowledge
gap is surprising given the pivotal role of mitochondria
in cell survival and functions, aging and human diseases.
The team of *Dr Sophie Breton* (*Canada Research
Chair in Evolutionray Mitochondrial Biology*) is inter-
ested in this fundamental knowledge gap in our under-
standing of adaptation and speciation processes through
the use an integrative approach combining epigenomics,
transcriptomics, physiology and cell biology to investi-
gate the capacity of mitochondria and their genomes to
adapt to changing environments. *The PhD project will
focus specically on the estimation of the prevalence
of mtORFans and their putative function(s).* Bivalves,
with their sex-specic mt-encoded proteins with (still un-
known) functions other than energy production, and/or
yeast (*S. cerevisiae*), with their important mitochon-
drial genome size, will oer unique opportunities to test
the hypothesis that like the nuclear DNA, the mtDNA
possesses several overlooked small protein-coding genes
that have key functions and are important sources of
functional novelty.
The starting date is scheduled for *May or September
2020 at the Universit e de Montr eal,* under the supervi-
sion of *Sophie Breton*. A $17,000 / year scholarship
is oered for three years with funding available for a
fourth year, but the successful candidate will be invited
to submit an application to the FRQNT and NSERC
as early as autumn 2019.
*Qualications: *
- Be highly motivated and determined to complete grad-
uated studies;
- Publication experience in scientic journals is valued;
- Have a good academic record (the minimum rating to
be admitted is 3.2 / 4.3);
- Having experience in cell / molecular biology is an
important asset.38 EvolDir July 1, 2019

WaspEvolutionaryGenetics
Open PhD position in Evolutionary Genetics & Analyt-
ical Chemistry:
The Molecular Evolutionary Biology and Chemical Com-
munication group at the Institute for Evolution and
Biodiversity at the University of Muenster, Germany,
are looking to ll a PhD Position (TV-L E13, 65%) for
the research project:
Genetic, chemical and behavioral investigation of sexual
signaling evolution in parasitoid wasps
The xed-term position is available for three years and
will begin on the 1st of September 2019 or as soon as
possible.
One of the most important questions in evolutionary
biology is how new species potentially originate. The
development and maintenance of barriers to interspe-
cic reproduction has been postulated to be the major
driving force of speciation. Variations in sexual sig-
naling have the potential to greatly contribute to keep
species reproductively isolated through species-specic
communication and recognition mechanisms. In the
insect model system Nasonia, a closely related species
complex of parasitoid jewel wasps, we could demonstrate
that female cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) function as
species-specic sex pheromones distinguishable by the
males, hinting at their profound role in reproductive
isolation. Curiously though, in one particular Nasonia
species (N. giraulti), an apparently recent evolutionary
leap shifted the female CHC prole out of the males
perceptive range, which, in turn, still retain a poten-
tially ancestral attraction to CHC proles of females
from other species.
In this PhD project, the successful candidate will havethe unique opportunity to track this highly unusual evo-
lutionary shift genetically, chemically and behaviorally
with the ultimate goal to unravel the key compounds
responsible for maintaining the sexual signaling function
in Nasonia CHC proles. The PhD candidate will estab-
lish experimental female backcrosses based on Nasonia
hybrids to enable the performance of haploid genetics on
Nasonia males to assess phenotypic traits related to CHC
signaling in the diploid Nasonia females. The sexual
attractiveness of the resulting hybrid female backcrosses
will be simultaneously accessed by our established male
mate choice assays as well as gas-chromatographic cou-
pled with tandem mass spectrometric analysis of their
corresponding CHC proles, utilizing our new, state-of-
the-art GC-MS/MS set-up. Furthermore, the successful
candidate is expected to generate a high-density ge-
nomic map based on Restriction-site Associated DNA
(RAD) sequencing for localizing quantitative trait loci
(QTL) governing CHC variation in the hybrid female
backcrosses. To conrm their function, the unraveled
candidate gene regions co-localizing with our predicted
QTL for CHC variation and female attractiveness will
be selectively knocked down in Nasonia females utilizing
double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi). Lastly,
the successful knockdown in the Nasonia females needs
to be conrmed behaviorally (male mate choice assays),
chemically (GC-MS/MS) and genetically (qPCR), for
unambiguously revealing the crucial components and
mechanisms governing the sexual signaling function in
Nasonia CHC proles.
The successful PhD candidate will be supervised by
Dr. Jan Buellesbach and integrated into the newly es-
tablished Chemical Communication within the larger
framework of Molecular Evolutionary Biology headed
by Prof. Dr. Juergen Gadau. The PhD student will also
have the chance to join the Muenster Graduate School
of Evolution, one of the largest graduate programs in
evolutionary biology in Germany.
How to apply:
The application should be compiled into a single PDF
le (max. 5 MB), which should include (1) a cover
letter stating the motivation to join the research project,
(2) a CV including information about former academic
education and degrees, professional experience, publi-
cations (if applicable), fellowships/awards, conference
contributions, languages, and further relevant skills and
abilities, (3) the candidates master thesis abstract, and
(4) two letters of recommendation from former supervi-
sors (which can also be sent directly to Dr. Buellesbach
by the respective supervisors independently from the
applicants other documents).
Applications should be sent by email as one PDF le toJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 39
Dr. Jan Buellesbach (buellesb@uni-muenster.de). The
deadline for the application is 1st of July 2019.
Requirements:
Applicants are required to have a master or equivalent
degree in biology, chemistry or a related eld. Appli-
cants are also expected to show a strong interest in
evolutionary biology, functional genetics and genomics
as well as analytical chemistry. Experience with genomic
mapping techniques, particularly RAD-sequencing and
QTL mapping as well as functional genetics approaches
such as dsRNAi and qPCR are highly desirable. Further-
more, high motivation to be trained in state-of-the-art
gas-chromatography coupled with tandem mass spec-

Title: Phenotypic plasticity and aging in a changing
world
Abstract: Human-induced changes such as clmate
change threaten many populations. Evidence suggests
that for many organisms, an increase in temperature
expedites aging. Importantly, aging is often associated
with the loss of phenotypic plasticity, key for popula-tion viability in a changing world. Surprisingly, we
know very little about how plasticity changes as organ-
isms age. This project will ll this knowledge gap on
age-dependent plasticity using both theoretical and em-
pirical approaches. Our project will reveal not only how
phenotypic plasticity can dampen the eect of climate
change, but also how, in turn, climate change itself can
aect phenotypic plasticity.
Candidate: We are looking for a candidate with a back-
ground in ecology and evolution, so they are familiar
with the theory and literature, although a candidate
with a background in mathematics, statistics and com-

Title: Could economic inequality be slowing trends to-
ward gender equity?
PROJECT DESCRIPTION As wealthy Western coun-
tries have progressed toward gender equity, dierences
between women and men in psychological traits, and
conditions like anxiety and depression have, paradoxi-
cally, increased. One intriguing possibility is that rising
income inequality among men and among women has
changed incentive structures leading to wider gender
gaps. Currently we know little about whether women
and men respond dierently to inequality.
This project includes experiments (conducted in person
and online) and a cross-national study in order to un-
derstand individual dierences in how people respond
to inequality and changing global trends in behaviour.
IDEAL CANDIDATE The candidate may have a back-
ground in evolutionary biology, psychology, behavioural
ecology, anthropology, or economics. They will be com-
mitted to the empirical, theory-driven study of human
behaviour and society.
Ideally they will have experience in research design and
statistical analysis. Programming experience and ad-
vanced computer science skills may be useful.
The phenomena we study are often ideologically polar-
ising, and require an ability to write and speak with
clarity and nuance. Evidence of excellent writing and
communication skills, in academic and/or non-academic
contexts, would be ideal.
We value diversity of background and experience in our
team. The cross-national nature of some of our work
means experience working in a variety of cultures will
be an asset.

UQueensland 2 MolecularEvolution
Two fully funded PhD scholarships (tuition and living
allowance) are available from the University of Queens-
land (UQ) to work on the below projects. The PhD
candidature at UQ is a full-time research position (no
teaching or service) and is typically completed within
3-3.5 years.
The successful candidates will join the Molecular Evolu-
tion, Pharmacology and Structure (MEPS) consortium,
which was recently established through Australian gov-
ernment funding. The three cornerstones of the con-
sortium (evolution, pharmacology and structure) are
combined to uncover the function of bioactive peptides
while improving our ability to engineer novel molecules:42 EvolDir July 1, 2019
Project: Ion channel structural biology (Biochemistry,
biophysics) The research groups have a strong inter-
est in discovery and characterisation of disulde-rich
peptides, many of which are sourced from venomous
animals, where they have evolved to exert their function
through interactions with ion channels. Subsequently,
these peptides have become invaluable tools in elucidat-
ing the structure and function of many ion channels.
This project involves the use of state-of-the-art bio-
chemical methods for production of peptides and ion
channels, and advanced biophysical techniques to study
their interactions at atomic resolution.
Project: Ion channel pharmacology (Electrophysiology,
pharmacology) The groups have a particular focus on
acid-sensing ion channels and voltage-gated sodium
channels and their role in pain as well as inammation
/ neuroinammation and their contribution to disorders
such as stroke, motor neuron disease and multiple scle-
rosis. This project will advance our knowledge in these
areas through use of electrophysiology methods (two-
electrode voltage clamping of Xenopus oocytes / patch
clamp of mammalian cells), HPLC, mass spectrometry,
molecular biology, peptide and protein production and
organ bath assays.
Project: Multidomain disulde-rich peptides (Biochem-
sitry, Biophysics) The groups have recently dened a
new class of multidomain disulde rich peptides with
unique pharmacological properties, referred to as Se-
creted Cysteine-rich REpeat Peptides (SCREPs). Using
custom bioinformatics tools, they have established a
large database of these molecules and have classied
them according to predicted structure and activity. The
project involves identication, production and charac-
terisation of SCREPs with potentially novel bioactivity.
Production, structural characterisation and evolutionary
analyses will be performed in-house, while activity and
function will be assessed through a network of ongoing
collaborations.
UQ is ranked well within the top 100 universities in the
world (46 in World Impact Ratings 2019), and hosts
a highly productive life science research environment
supported by world class research infrastructure. The
St Lucia campus, where these projects are based, covers
a large area of lakes, sub-tropical plants and wildlife
providing a stunning backdrop to a thriving social and
academic environment. The campus is located in Bris-
bane, which is well-known for its relaxed city living,
close proximity to beautiful rainforests, excellent diving,
and some of the worlds best beaches.

PhD position in human evolutionary biology
The study of pre-industrial human populations oers a
unique opportunity to answer questions in evolutionary
biology that require longitudinal data over many gener-
ations. We use a remarkable database assembled at the
Universit e de Montr eal which includes the life-histories
of more than 800,000 individuals born between 1608 and
1750. Date of birth and death are known in more than
80% of the cases and the genealogy of married women
is known in 95% of the cases, making this dataset one
of the most detailed of its kind in the world.
Our goal is to study carry-over eects of early life con-
ditions on tness and measure how the heritability of
tness is context-dependent (family, environment) and
is aected by intergenerational environmental eects.
Other questions of interest from the PhD candidate are
welcome.
Candidates should possess or have interest in gaining
strong biostatistical skills. Funding is available for three
years but candidates will also be required to seek for
external grants (e.g. FRQNT, NSERC). The expected
starting date is September 2019. The PhD candidate
will be co-supervised at the Universit e de Sherbrooke
and Bishop's University, Canada, and will be expected
to interact with our collaborators in demography at the
Universit e de Montr eal.
If interested, send an email to Patrick Bergeron
(patrick.bergeron@ubishops.ca) or to Fanie Pelletier
(fanie.pelletier@usherbrooke.ca) before June 28th, in-
cluding a cover letter, a copy of your CV and a tran-

USC. Disease Outbreak and sociality in reptiles
A PhD project is available in Celine Frere's Lab on the
interaction between disease and sociality in eastern wa-
ter dragons. In particular, the project will focus on the
impact of the disease on sociality, whether it is socially
transmitted and potential link to genetics (MHC com-
plex). This PhD project will take advantage of 9 years
of behavioural, ecological and genetic dataset on eastern
water dragons located at the Roma Street Parkland in
Brisbane, Australia (www.celinefrerelab.com).
This project is based on our recent discovery of a serious
fungal disease outbreak in eastern water dragons, gen-
era Nannizziopsis (Publication currently in Review). As
part of this disease outbreak, we have been monitoring
its prevalence in our long-term monitoring population
at the Roma Street Parkland providing us with a unique
opportunity to investigate its prevalence, transmission
and potential genetic basis.
This project will require PhD students to develop strong
quantitative skills (R coding and modelling), spend time
in the eld and be willing to learn molecular skills. We
also foster strong collaborations, team work and inclu-
sivity.
Applicants will need to have an extremely competitive
academic record and obtain an Australian Postgraduate
Award or International Research and Fee Remission
Scholarships. More information about the application
process and internal deadlines for prospective students

USC. Social Evolution in dolphins
A PhD project is available in Celine Frere's Lab on the
evolution of social behaviour in dolphins. In particu-lar, the project will focus on the role that long-term
avoidances play in shaping dyadic social cohesion and
population level social structure. This PhD project will
take advantage of the 36+ years of behavioural, ecologi-
cal and genetic dataset on the Monkey Mia, Shark Bay,
dolphins (https://monkeymiadolphins.org).
Most research on the evolution of social behaviour has to
date focused on aliative behaviour. This was obviously
inuenced by our desire to understand the evolution of
cooperative behaviour; a threat to Darwin's theory of
natural selection. However, aliation represents only
one side of the coin: individuals also can and do choose
to actively and consistently avoid conspecics over long
periods of time, even when they share space or habitat.
Though avoidance is generally accepted as an alterna-
tive to preference in animal societies, few studies have
attempted to characterise the ecological or genetic con-
ditions that drive its evolution.
This PhD project will be based at the University of
the Sunshine Coast, Australia. You will be supervised
by Dr Celine Frere (www.celinefrerelab.com) and co-
supervised by Professor Janet Mann (Georgetown Uni-
versity). This project will require PhD students to
develop strong quantitative skills (R coding and mod-
elling) as well as spending 2 months per year in the eld
in Monkey Mia, Shark Bay, Western Australia.
Applicants will need to have an extremely competitive
academic record and obtain an Australian Postgraduate
Award or International Research and Fee Remission
Scholarships. The RTP Scholarship Round will open
on Monday 3 June. More information about the appli-
cation process and internal deadlines for prospective

Job announcement
Research Group Insect-Fungus Symbiosis, Zoology 3,
University of W urzburg, Germany
PhD position ' Evolutionary Ecology of Sociality in
Ambrosia Beetles
Application deadline: 30.6.2019Three-year PhD position in \Evolutionary Ecology of
Sociality in Fungus-Farming Ambrosia Beetles"
We seek a highly motivated biologist with a keen interest
in the ecology and evolution of insect social behaviour to
join our research group at the University in Wuerzburg,
Germany (www.insect-fungus.com).
Description: Our main models are bark and ambrosia
beetles (AB), which live in subsocial to eusocial soci-
eties within wood, where they cultivate fungi on walls
of their tunnels. Both sociality and fungiculture evolved
in several independent lineages under dierent ecolog-
ical conditions, levels of relatedness and ploidy. They
remained poorly studied although they are excellent
models to test pending evolutionary questions.
Details of the project: - Is it possible to articially select
for/against sociality in AB? - How is division of labour
chemically regulated in AB societies? - How do AB
supress pathogens and promote cultivars in their fungus
gardens? - How does AB social evolution aect the
evolution of fungiculture and vice versa?
In our work we combine eld studies with lab exper-
iments and apply an interdisciplinary approach, com-
bining selection experiments, experimental assays, and
culturing methods with state-of-the-art molecular (e.g.
metabarcoding) and biochemical (e.g. GC-MS) tech-
niques.
We require: - MSc degree in either Biology, Entomology,
Evolutionary Biology or Chemical Ecology - Due to
the interdisciplinary nature of the projects, successful
candidates must be willing to become acquainted with
methods from dierent elds. - Experience working with
insects is a plus. - Prociency in English and a good
team spirit are a must. - Knowledge on basic molecu-
lar methods, statistics (R skills), chemical ecology and
bioinformatics are a plus.
We oer: - An exciting research project to build on a
scientic career. - A cooperative and highly ambitious
young research group, as part of a vivid department. -
Opportunities to visit collaborating labs worldwide. -
Salary according to public service positions in Germany
(TVL E13: 65%) for three years. The University of
W urzburg is an equal opportunity employer, i.e. female
scientists are particularly encouraged to apply and dis-
abled applicants will be preferentially considered in case
of equivalent aptitude.
The Host: We are one of a few labs in the
world to study AB. For details on our projects see
www.insect-fungus.com or directly contact Dr. Pe-
ter Biedermann (peter.biedermann@uni-wuerzburg.de;

Exposito-Alonso Lab - www.moisesexpositoalonso.org
Starting September 2019 on
We aim to recruit a highly motivated and skillful re-
searcher with training in molecular, developmental biol-
ogy or bioengineering.
We seek to understand the impacts of climate change
on the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of
plant species. Combining computational tools with ex-
perimental data, we can nd the genetic loci involved
in past and current adaptations, which can then be
manipulated in the lab with novel genetic engineering
techniques to understand the mechanisms of such adap-
tations and potentially speed up adaptation to future
climates (see www.moisesexpositoalonso.org/research).
The successful candidate will be involved in conducting
next generation sequencing of samples from the inter-
national GrENE-net project and the development of
molecular genetics tools to catalyze plant adaptation to
simulated climate change conditions in the lab.
Depending on the candidate, this position can be lled
as technician, sta researcher, or postdoc. This is afull-time position with competitive salary and bene-
ts (conditions negotiable). The lab is located at the
Carnegie Institution on Stanford campus, with access
to Stanford facilities. Stanford campus is a vibrant com-
munity embedded in the San Francisco Bay area, with
opportunities for extensive social and scientic interac-
tions. The initial term will be for one year with potential
renewal of up to ve years depending on performance.
The required qualications for this position are a BSc or
a PhD degree (depending on position level) in biology,
molecular biology, biotechnology, or bioengineering, and
some laboratory experience in at least one of the fol-
lowing: next generation sequencing, gene cloning, gene
transformation, and CRISPR/Cas9 editing. We prefer
candidates willing to work closely with collaborators
and lab members and to interact with the dynamic re-
search community at the Carnegie Plant Biology and
Global Ecology departments, and the Stanford Biology,
Genetics and Bioengineering departments.
Informal inquiries about this position can be made by
emailing Moises (Moi) Exposito-Alonso at moisesexpos-
itoalonso@gmail.com. To be formally considered, please
include a cover letter and CV, and indicate 3 referees
that I can ask for letters of recommendation.

BioinformaticsSoftwareDevelopment
Hi EvolDir,
We are developing a platform to integrate data on ge-
netic and agricultural diversity into CONABIO's bio-
diversity information system. This type of data is nor-
mally published as les with arbitrary formats that are
dicult to relate to each other and that become obso-
lete with time. This restricts the usefulness of data to
generate knowledge beyond the immediate project for
which they were generated. There are public databases
specialized in this type of data (e.g., NCBI, EBI, TAIR),
but they do not store all the information of interest
for CONABIO and are separated from other useful in-
formation (e.g. geolocation, environmental variables,
phenotypic measurements).
The goal of CONABIO is to provide a standardized
and modular platform that allows to store, manage and
retrieve data easily and quickly. For this, data models
that can cover complex data belonging to the same con-
cept will be dened and repeated within the projects.
The platform is being implemented using GraphQL
accessible via HTTP and a graphical interface. The
programming language is NodeJS.
We have software developer open position to join a
Mexican-German team working in the project mentioned
above. The job is based at Mexico City, but there is
exibility for remote working. Understanding of written
Spanish is required. The call for applications is directed
to candidates with a computing science background, but
biologist or other elds with strong bioinformatics are
also encouraged to apply.

Vocal communication in wild zebra nches
We are looking for a eld research assistant for our next
eld season on wild zebra nches at Fowlers Gap Arid
Zone Research Station, New South Wales, Australia (for
some pictures and information on this beautiful outback
location visit https://www.fowlersgap.unsw.edu.au/).
The work is part of a PhD project by Hugo Loning from
Wageningen University, supervised by Marc Naguib (Wa-
geningen University) and Simon Grith (Macquarie Uni-
versity). In this project, we are looking at the ecology
and evolutionary functions of their vocal communication
in the context of breeding decisions.
The eldwork involves observing birds, setting up nest-
boxes on steel beams (that have to be driven into the
ground), performing breeding checks, conducting play-
back experiments and audio recording of birds. Field-
work will be physically demanding and takes place in
hot conditions, so applicants should be in good physical
condition. Although we try to avoid the heat as much
as possible by going out early in the day and in season,
we would like to stress that it is important that you are
somewhat heat-resistant. Experience in bird handling
and general ornithological skills, such as bird observ-
ing and identifying is greatly valued. Experience with
acoustic equipment is an advantage, but not essential.
We will access the dierent eld locations by car on un-
paved roads and that is why a drivers license is required.
Work will take place in a small team (2-3 people) in a
remote environment, so it is important that applicantscan work together and communicate with others well,
preferably also outside of the work environment because
you will be part of a small social group of international
researchers at the research station.
We will cover accommodation at the research station,
where we will share facilities (big communal kitchen
and living room, showers, washing machine etc.) with
other researchers. We will be staying in a dormitory,
and depending on the amount of researchers on site,
you will have a private room or have to share a room
with 1-2 other people. Phone and internet access at the
station is limited and variable. Once every 2-3 weeks
we will visit the nearest town, Broken Hill, to stock up
on groceries and communicate with the outside world.
This project oers an unique opportunity to work on
wild zebra nches, the worlds most studied songbird in
the lab. Additionally, applicants can gain a lot of eld
research experience on various ways of data collection
and managing. It is also denitely possible to pursue a
small individual research project (topic to be discussed)
within the scope of the eldwork that needs to be con-
ducted. This eld assistant position will be ideal for
somebody who wants to get some more eld experience
before nding a job in behavioural ecology or similar
evolutionary biology elds.
Fieldwork will take place from mid August to mid De-
cember 2019, although the end date is somewhat exi-
ble (could be earlier), depending on the zebra nches
breeding attempt. Since eldwork starts already in 1.5
months, we want to ll this position as soon as possi-
ble. Therefore, we will review applications as they are
received and we will stop considering applicants after
we have found a suitable candidate. Please send your
application to the email address below and include 1) a
small cover letter on why you are a suitable candidate
and 2) your CV. We are looking forward to hearing from70 EvolDir July 1, 2019

Call for research proposals on Genomics of human in-
fectious diseases
The increased availability and decreased cost of sequence
data is transforming research in epidemiology and pub-
lic health. For instance, the ebola outbreak in West
Africa in 2014-2016 has led to a rapid and massive
production, and sharing, of throusands of virus full
genomes sequences. What is true for microbial genomics
is also becoming true for human genomics. Recently,
the UK biobank has released a database including more
than 100,000 human genomes. The availability of these
genomes has implications from epidemiology (under-
standing how microbes spread) to immunology (identi-
fying candidate genes for vaccines or treatments).
MIVEGEC (Montpellier, France) is a leading research
unit in Europe working on the ecology and evolution
of infectious diseases. It has strong expertise in vector-
borne diseases, mathematical modeling and virus evolu-
tion. The department is looking for a young research
to set up a team on human and/or microbial genomics
with implications on public health.
The department calls for applications (see details be-
low) to elaborate a proposal to be submitted to the
Fondation pour la Recherche M edicale (FRM). If se-
lected by the FRM, the applicant will be awarded a
200kegrant in the rst year to set-up his/her group and
will have an option for a 100k egrant the second year.
This funding can be used for the PIs salary (if neces-
sary), to hire a post-doctoral research fellow or engineer,
and for consumables. In return, the department will
provide access to its facilities, including the platforms
(e.g. the IRD bioinformatics cluster). Applicants are
also expected to apply for other types of funding by
the end of the rst year (ANR, ERC). Further details
about the FRM application (in French) can be found
here: https://www.frm.org/chercheurs/appel-a-projets-
frm/espoirs-de-la-recherche Elligibility criteria
- Demonstrate early career achievement in genomics ofhuman infectious diseases. - At the deadline, hold a PhD
for less than 7 years (career breaks will be taken into
account). - Not being currently supported by a signi-
cant independent grant (e.g. ERC, ATIP-Avenir, ANR
Jeune Chercheur / Jeune Chercheuse). - Demonstrate
mobility throughout the scientic career. - Demonstrate
integration in international reserch networks.
Applications
Applicants should submit a 1-page CV, an exhaustive
list of publications, a research achivement statement
(less than 5 pages) and a research project (less than 5
pages). They can also add up to two recommendation
letters.
3 to 5 applicants will be selected to be interviewed by
an international panel in Montpellier
Importantly, success to this call does not guarantee
success to the FRM call. The applicant selected by
MIVEGEC will only be allowed to apply to the FRM.
Timing
- Deadline for the call: July 10, 2019 - Results for the
pre-interview step: mid-Aug 2019 - Interviews in Mont-
pellier: between 10 and 20 Sept, 2019

Hi Folks, We have a new internship opportunity avail-
able at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural
History, Department of Invertebrate Zoology - see de-
scription below and link for more information. Please
help us spread the word about this exciting opportunity
by sharing it with your students and colleagues.
The internship is open to US citizens and permanent
residents who have completed their BA/BS within the
last 2 years. Individuals of diverse backgrounds are
strongly encouraged to apply.

Fellowship program: Science Communication Internship
Project Description: One of our primary missions at
the Smithsonian is the diusion of knowledge. At the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History,
basic, exploratory science is a foundation of what we
do, however dissemination of that exciting work is
hindered by a large disconnect between that research
and what is presented to the public. Our in-person
and online visitors easily relate to well-known subjects
like mammals and birds, things they see every day and
which we know well based on a couple centuries of74 EvolDir July 1, 2019
study. The public is far less likely to know much about
invertebrates or animals in the ocean because they
are much further removed from our everyday life, yet,
these are the organisms that drive most of the natural
processes that impact our quality of life on earth (e.g.
the carbon cycle, the water cycle, and climate). We
want to correct this familiarity disconnect, we want
to capture the public's interest and disseminate the
amazing stories our researchers are pursuing. By doing
this, we not only inform the public, but we inspire
the next generation of scientists and citizens that will
shape our future. We will embed a budding science
writer within the Department of Invertebrate Zoology
and teach them to translate our stories into compelling
public outreach channeled through SIs established
outlets including social media, websites, and direct
contact with visitors.
Learning Objectives: This is a great opportunity for a
student interested in both science and communications
to develop their skills and to work with a diverse set
of researchers. The intern will become familiar with a
broad suite of research programs, projects and personnel
within the NMNH's Department of Invertebrate Zool-
ogy; learn to craft a scientic story in 280 characters to
2 pages, in order to engage and inspire the public, and
work with images to accompany stories.

Vignettes on
EvolutionaryApplications
Dear EvolDir,
We have extended the deadline for 2-3 page vignettes
on Applications of Evolution to topics that impact our
world in a variety of ways. The concept is to identify
primary research papers that have exciting applications
of evolution to areas of impact on environment (climate
change, conservation, biotic assembly, etc.), medicine
(infectious disease, genomics, human phenotypic varia-
tion, etc.), and Society (agriculture, law, computation,
language, etc.). Then develop a lay summary (2 page,
2 gure/table) of the research topic for use in teaching
eorts at high school, college, and political levels. We
envision graduate seminars and/or lab groups focused on
developing such vignettes and submitting for peer review
via EasyChair https://easychair.org/cfp/EvolApps2019.
We have a distinguished Program Committee to review
vignettes from around the world. The top 50 vignettes
will be published in a volume by Oxford University Press
with up to four articles winning a cash prize. We hope
faculty and graduate students will organize around the
world and produce exciting vignettes for submission by
our extended July 31, 2019 deadline. You can nd more
information and some example vignettes here https:/-
/www.evolutionapps.org/. Please let me know if you
have any questions or need any guidance as your are
developing your Evolutionary Applications!

departments; (2) increase the number of faculty in the
United States that are familiar with barriers to inclu-
sion in STEM, and can apply evidence-based techniques
for countering known barriers; (3) develop a commu-
nity of faculty that can serve as leaders{at their home
institutions and nationally{in inclusive teaching and
assessment; and (4) identify cultural factors associated
with a shift towards evidence-based teaching, especially
pertaining to inclusive teaching. These activities will
be integrated throughout thousands of students? rst
and second years of higher education, and all of them
involve evidence- based techniques and experiences.
Postdoc responsibilities. This individual will complete
the following related to EDU-STEM: (1) conduct re-
search that aligns with the applicant?s interests on data
collected from participating EDU-STEM institutions,

Cissy Ballen <mjb0100@auburn.edu >Barcelona GeneNetworkEvolution
Barcelona Postdoc: Evolution of gene networks and the
origins of organismal complexity.
1.Basic job and project description:
2,5 years postdoc in evolutionary biology in Barcelona.
The job is the Autonomous University of Barcelona
(UAB) and in the Centre de Recerca Matem ~A|tica
(CRM). The CRM is in the UAB campus.
-The main project questions are:
How should gene networks and cell interactions be or-
ganized to lead to biological complexity?
How is such organization achieved in evolution?
How does gene network organization aect variational
properties of the phenotype (e.g. evolvability)?
Any other question of the applicant's interest that is
related to the previous questions.
We will use computational models of the genotype-
phenotype map and computational models of evolution
by natural selection to study such questions for the
case of organismic complexity (e.g. anatomy). The
genotype-phenotype maps models we develop are based
on realistic gene network models of pattern formation
and morphogenesis that lead to realistic 3D multicellular
phenotypes.
The position is in Salazar-Ciudad's group.
2. Background of the project:
There is no consensus denition of complexity, yet it is
evident that organisms are complex and explaining such
complexity is one of the most fundamental questions of
biology. Morphological complexity has not increased in
the evolution of all lineages and, in general, it is unclear
whether there is a general trend of increasing complexity
in evolution. Yet, one may ask about the mechanisms
by which such complexity has increased in the lineages
where it has increased. How complexity increases dur-
ing evolution is necessarily related to development: any
evolutionary change in morphology is rst a change in
the development that produces such morphology.
It has been argued that, in spite of the remarkable mor-
phological complexity of organisms, their development is
achieved through a limited number of cell behaviors and
types of cell interactions. These cell behaviors would be80 EvolDir July 1, 2019
cell division, cell adhesion, cell death, cell growth, cell
contraction, extracellular signal and matrix secretion,
extracellular signal reception and cell dierentiation.
In addition to cell behaviors, development involves in-
teractions between cells, either mechanical or through
extracellular signalling.
The questions we want to approach in this study are:
how should these interactions and cell behaviors be co-
ordinated to produce complex and robust morphologies?
The question is, then, whether there are some logical
requirements that developmental mechanisms should
fulll in order to lead to complex robust morphologies.
Are there, for example, some requirements at the level
of gene network topology or at the level of cell behaviors
and their coordination during development?
If, as suggested above, pattern transformations in de-
velopment involve a limited set of cell behaviors and
cell interactions, then any mathematical model imple-
menting those and intracellular gene networks should
be able to reproduce, to a large extent, the range of pat-
tern transformations possible in animal development. In
this project we will use one such model, EmbryoMaker
(Marin-Riera et al, 2015)^ a |, to simulate a large num-
ber of possible developmental mechanisms and try to
discover what, if anything, do the mechanisms leading
to robust complex morphologies have in common.
3. Job description
The main tasks of the post-doc include using and mod-
ifying existing models of embryonic development (e.g.
EmbryoMaker) in order to simulate the development of
complex phenotypes. These models will be combined
with models of evolution, in a population context with
mutation, genetic drift and natural selection on morphol-
ogy (see for example Salazar-Ciudad and Marin-Riera,
2013). The gene networks found to lead to the devel-
opment of complex and robust phenotypes in evolution
would be analyzed to extract general regularities, if any,
these gene networks need to fulll. The main tasks,
thus, consist in simulation, theorizing, data analysis, sci-
entic programming, literature searching, writing and
presenting results in conferences. The post-doc is ex-
pected to lead part of the project and develop his/her
own research questions within the general framework
of the project. We, thus, seek candidates highly mo-
tivated for theoretical work and data analysis with a
broad understanding of the evolutionary theory and/or
developmental biology and/or modeling.
4. Requirements:
-The applicant should hold a PhD in either evolutionary
biology, developmental biology, systems biology, bio-
physics, mathematical or theoretical biology.-Scientic programming skills or a willingness to acquire
them is required.
-The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.

project will explore its genome, the population history
of New England sugar kelp, and take advantage of its
biphasic lifecycle to rapidly domesticate it using cutting
edge genomic selection methods.
The Section of Plant Breeding & Genetics, within the
School of Integrative Plant Sciences, trains interdis-
ciplinary scientists in the elaboration of new breeding
methods, the discovery of genetic mechanisms important
for economically important traits, and the development
of genetic stocks, germplasm, and varieties. Cornell
University plant breeders are world leaders in innovative
plant breeding research, teaching, and extension, and
we collaborate globally.
The Jannink lab works with several crop species (wheat,
oat, barley, cassava, and kelp) to develop new genomic
prediction methods and integrate them optimally within
breeding schemes. Many researchers are active in this
area. We work together to discover, build on, and share
new ideas and tools from across computational disci-
plines that lead to successful applied breeding outcomes.
The postdoc will collaborate with scientists at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute, the University of Con-
necticut, and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotech-
nology. We are a team discovering together how to
address a range of challenges from evaluating many
unique genotypes in common gardens, to isolating high
molecular weight DNA in kelp, to designing breeding
schemes around the kelp life cycle. Primary tasks for
the postdoc include the bioinformatic analysis of a large82 EvolDir July 1, 2019
panel of resequenced haploid kelp gametophytes to iden-
tify variants, use the panel as an imputation reference
population, and estimate important population genetic
parameters of New England sugar kelp. Individuals
from this panel have been mated and their sporophyte
progeny are being evaluated o the Massachusetts and
New Hampshire coasts by collaborators. The postdoc
will be the team's expert resource on bioinformatics
and quantitative genetic questions. The postdoc will
analyze data from experiments for genome wide asso-
ciation between variants and multiple phenotypes, for
the training of genomic prediction models, and for esti-
mating parameters of kelp population and quantitative
genetics. Based on these analyses, the postdoc will se-
lect among newly-generated gametophytes genotyped by
low-depth skim sequencing. Finally, the postdoc will de-
sign and analyze validation eld experiments measuring
the performance of progeny sporophytes. Further possi-
bilities for the data include research on linear models to
predict heterosis and the identication of evolutionary
conservation and signatures of selection in the sugar
kelp genome.

About the group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population ge-
netics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity.
We have recently demonstrated that coding sequences
of cancer tumors not only exhibit positively selected
mutations that drive cancer (www.biorxiv.org/content/-
10.1101/485292v1), but that there exist genes that the
tumor cannot aord to lose to the mutational pres-
sure (www.nature.com/articles/ng.3987). In addition
to genes, we have also identied cancer driver loci in
the non-coding part of the genome (www.nature.com/-
articles/s41467-017-00100-x). Both coding and non-
coding selection can act to promote cancer defense mech-
anisms against therapy, which can be unveiled through
the analysis of time-sequence data of cell-free DNA and
of patient survival data.July 1, 2019 EvolDir 83
The group is particularly interested in how the evolu-
tion and survival of cancer cell populations relies on
mutation inux and in the selection inference from al-
lele frequency information. To this end, we develop
mathematical and computational approaches to esti-
mate mutation rates and selection. We use whole-exome
sequencing and whole-genome data repositories to ana-
lyze selection on coding and non-coding sequences. In
addition, we analyze cell-free DNA from tumors and
their temporal evolution in response to therapy. Esti-
mates of the strength of selection in cancer allow for a
prioritization of genes and non-coding regions by their
disease relevance, with the ultimate goal of promoting
therapeutic advances.

lished in October 2018 and is part of the \Bioinformatics

*1 year postdoctoral research position in ecotoxicology '
La Rochelle (France)*
*Context* Mercury (Hg) still raises high environmental
concerns in the Arctic. This toxicant is indeed found
in high concentrations in Arctic marine food webs and
these concentrations might keep on increasing in some
Arctic regions under the eect of global change. In
that context, understanding impacts of Hg on the Arc-
tic wildlife, and especially on top-predators which are
among the most vulnerable organisms to environmental
pollution, is a major objective. Toxic eects of Hg have
been widely investigated, including on Arctic species.
However, in polar seabirds, a very few studies have as-
sessed long-term population eects of Hg and almost
nothing is known about eects of the parental mer-
cury contamination on ospring phenotype and survival
prospects. This is unfortunate as chick body condition,
growth and ultimately survival will play a role in the
dynamics of these vulnerable populations and their fu-
ture distribution around the Arctic. Telomeres are long
repetitive noncoding sequences of DNA located at the
end of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. These telomeres
inexorably shorten through life and this rate of shorten-
ing can be modulated by environmental conditions and
exposure to environmental stressors such as pollutants.
A couple of studies recently demonstrated in Arctic
seabirds how telomere dynamics is linked to bird con-
tamination by some persistent organic pollutants (OCPs
and PFASs). Exposure to stressors is also well known to
have transgenerational eects, with stress levels in the
parental line having long-term negative consequences
on ospring health. Recent studies have shown that
these transgenerational eects might be mediated, at
least in part, by telomere attrition. For instance, birds
experimentally stressed during egg production produced
chicks with shorter telomeres than controls. Hg, as a
major environmental stressor, could therefore impact
stress and telomere length of both parents and their
chick, with potential subsequent consequences on chick
phenotype and survival.
*Position* We are seeking for an enthusiastic postdoc-
toral researcher to work on a project aiming at under-
standing the long-term eects of Hg accumulated byJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 89
adult Arctic seabirds on the next generation. More
specically, by focusing on a little auk (Alle alle) pop-
ulation from Greenland, the postdoctoral researcher
will in a rst step study how adult Hg contamination
impact their chick's Hg contamination and ecophysiolog-
ical condition (telomere length, oxidative stress, growth,
body condition) and ultimately survival capacity. In a
second step, the role played by adult movements and
distribution during the non-breeding period on Hg con-
centrations accumulated by females prior the laying
period and subsequently on chicks will be investigated.
The position will involve some lab work as the postdoc-
toral researcher will be in charge of analyzing telomere
length from little auk blood samples at the CEBC insti-
tute. Oxidative stress data will be provided as well as
ecological data.
*Qualications* - PhD in ecotoxicology or ecophysiology
- Experience with lab work - Knowledge of Arctic marine
ecosystems and/or seabird ecophysiology will be an asset
- Applicants who show an interest in applying to further
funding to work in our lab and pursue the project past

recrutement/ Postdoctoral position92 EvolDir July 1, 2019
Location: FRB ' CESAB, 5, rue de l' ~Acole de M edecine,
34000 Montpellier, France
Salary: 2250 eper month
Contract: 2 years xed term, full time
Closing date: 31 August 2019
Starting date: 1 November 2019
**Job information**
*The project*
The CESAB project \DiveRS" is looking for a moti-
vated candidate for a two-year postdoctoral position on
angiosperm breeding system evolution. The project is
a collaborative eort of 15 researchers* from dierent
parts of the world to understand how breeding system
evolution in plants is linked to the evolution of other
traits, as well as speciation and extinction. So far, sev-
eral patterns have been observed and described, such
as the \selng syndrome" or the correlations of sexual
systems with life-history traits, and these have been
used to try to understand the eect of breeding systems
on evolutionary success. However, many traits that are
associated with breeding systems are also thought to
inuence diversication through other ways. To bet-
ter distinguish causes and eects, this project seeks to
dene integrated evolutionary strategies among these
traits and then to investigate how these strategies evolve
and shape the diversication process in owering plants.
This will be done by gathering and analyzing comple-
mentary databases on breeding systems and other plant
traits with large-scale phylogenetic information.
* DiveRS members are : Bruce Anderson (Stellenbosch
University, South Africa), Sylvain Billiard (University of
Lille 1, France), Concetta Burgarella (CIRAD Montpel-
lier, France), Hugo de Boer (University of Oslo, Norway),
Mathilde Dufa ~A> (University of Montpellier, France),
Sylvain Gl emin (PI, CNRS Rennes, France), Emma
Goldberg (University of Minnesota, USA), Jos K afer
(co-PI, CNRS Lyon, France), Sarah Otto (University of
British Columbia, Canada), Marcos M endez (Universi-
dad Rey Juan Carlos, Spain), John Pannell (University
of Lausanne, Switzerland), Denis Roze (CNRS Rosco,
France), Daniel Schoen (McGill University, Canada),
J urg Schonenberger (University of Vienna, Austria),
Mario Vallejo-Marin (University of Stirling, UK).
*Postdoctoral position*
The role of the postdoctoral researcher will be central in
this project, as he/she will work directly on a database
of angiosperm breeding systems and possibly associated
traits. He/she will combine information from several
published databases and currently private data collec-
tions of the project participants. He/she will conductmultivariate analyses on these data, and put these in a
phylogenetic context. Further questions studied will de-
pend on the researcher's interests and skills, but could
include diversication analyses, study of genome ar-
chitecture, and developing or adapting mathematical
models.
The postdoctoral researcher will be based at CESAB in
the Montpellier city center. He/she will be assisted by
CESAB's data-analyst, and will have frequent interac-
tions with the project coordinators Sylvain Gl emin (PI,
Rennes) and Jos K afer (co-PI, Lyon). The researchers
participating in the project will meet twice a year in
Montpellier, and the postdoctoral researcher can per-
form short-term visits to some of their labs.
*Requirements*
The candidate should have a background in evolution
and ecology. As the researcher will directly deal with
large datasets of plants and their traits, at least some
knowledge of botany and plant systematics is essen-
tial. Furthermore, the candidate should have experience
with the informatic and statistical treatment of large
datasets. Previous experience with database manage-
ment is a plus. Finally, the candidate is expected to
have an interest and experience in at least one of the
following elds: phylogenetic comparative methods, an-
cestral state reconstructions, diversication analyses,
evolutionary genetics, mathematical modeling. Good
communication skills in English are required, and at
least some knowledge of french (or the motivation to
learn some) would be benecial.

tivated, collaborative post-doctoral fellow to join us as94 EvolDir July 1, 2019
part of a new NSF Plant Genome-funded collaboration
with Jason Holliday (Virginia Tech), Stephen Keller
(Vermont) and Matt Fitzpatrick (U of Maryland).
The project includes a large collaboration with Arb-
Net (Morton Arboretum), and will combine full-genome
resequencing of Poplar clones of mixed ancestry (P. tri-
chocarpa x P. balsamifera) with phenotypic and climatic
data from Poplar 'mini common gardens' established in
arboreta across the United States. The post-doctoral po-
sition is highly interdisciplinary, combining phenotypic
data across a broad range of environments and genome
resequencing to identify regions of the genome that
contribute disproportionately to phenotypic dierences
across varying ancestral backgrounds and environments.
A major goal will be to develop new methods combin-
ing spatial modeling of adaptive genetic variation with
genomewide genome-phenotypic associations to identify
genetic variation that may indicate pre-adaptation to
novel climate conditions. In addition, this position has
an extensive outreach component. Working alongside
ArbNet, the post-doctoral fellow will lead and coordi-
nate establishment of Poplar 'mini gardens' in arboreta
across the United States and design curricula appro-
priate for middle school programs that illustrate the
principles of climate adaptation and phenological varia-
tion. The goal will be to engage students in discussions
of biological responses to climate change, experimental
design, and hypothesis testing while providing hands-on
data collection opportunities from the 'mini gardens'.
The position will be based at North Dakota State Uni-
versity in the Department of Biological Sciences. Appli-
cants must be willing to travel to arboreta across the
United States and collaborator institutions. Travel costs
will be covered by the grant.
The ideal candidate will be able to contribute to leader-
ship within this new project, coordinate with a number
of dierent collaborative researchers, and support ongo-
ing research in the lab. The successful candidate will
have background in population genomics, evolutionary
biology, quantitative genetics, hybridization/speciation
or related elds. The postdoctoral fellow will be ex-
pected to analyze genomic, phenotypic and climatic
datasets, lead preparation and publication of peer-
reviewed manuscripts, and present ndings from the
research project. In addition, there will be ample oppor-
tunity to pursue research questions besides those of the
particular study. In particular, the goal of establishing
the 'mini gardens' across North American arboreta will
be to provide a long-term foundation for collaborative
research.
The start date is exible. Salary will be dependent on
experience, and include benets. The initial appoint-ment is for one year with the possibility of renewal
for up to three years. For more information on the

UGeorgia ViralSymbiosisInsects
Postdoctoral position on insect-viral symbiosis
This position is for research on evolution, development,
symbiosis and insects. Specically, the lab has funding
for work on parasitoid wasps (wasps that lay eggs in
other insects and consume them during development)
as a study system: 1) molecular mechanisms that guide
insect-microbe interactions or 2) discovery and compar-
ison of independent virus symbiont acquisition events
across the parasitoid wasps. Several lineages of wasps
have acquired associations with benecial symbiotic
viruses that are specically produced in wasp reproduc-
tive tracts and are injected into host insects. There,
they play vital roles in preventing hosts from mounting
eective defenses against the developing parasitoid. The
production of virus in wasps is very tightly timed and
coincides with specic stages of wasp development. The
lab is seeking an energetic postdoc with interests in
some of these topics and a strong background in one or
more of the following: evolutionary biology, genomics,
or molecular genetics. The position is in the Entomology
department at the University of Georgia and is available
immediately but the start date is negotiable.

Arctic vegetation dynamics. By partitioning impacts
on community structure into the four basic processes of

NongeneticEectsEvolution
*Postdoc (15 months): Non-genetic eects in evolution*
I am seeking a highly motivated postdoc to join the
Lind lab at Dept. of Animal Ecology, Evolutionary Bi-
ology Centre (EBC), Uppsala University in a 15-month
project funded by Carl Tryggers Foundation and the
Swedish Research Council VR.
Project: The belief that the genetic code is the sole basis
for biological inheritance has been challenged by pheno-
typic plasticity, parental eects and more recently by the
discovery of trans-generational epigenetic inheritance,
where environmentally induced phenotypes are inher-
ited for several generations by factors that determine
how DNA is read. However, the adaptive signicance
of complementary inheritance systems that is induced
by the environment is enigmatic.
The project aim is to investigate the evolution and evo-
lutionary consequences of adaptive plastic, epigenetic,
trans-generational and genetic inheritance during adap-
tation to new environments that dier in heterogeneity,
using the powerful laboratory model system of the nema-
todes Caenorhabditis remanei and C. elegans. We will
mainly perform trans-generational phenotypic assays of
life history traits, including analysis of already existing
lines that have evolved for over hundred generations.
You will join the lab of Dr. Martin Lind, and be part
of the well-equipped nematode lab, led by two PIs (Dr.
Lind and Dr. Bolund). In the Lind lab, we are interested
in life history evolution in its broad sense, with special
emphasis on local adaptation, the evolution of inheri-
tance systems, life-history trade-os and the evolution of
ageing. We encourage an open and collaborative atmo-
sphere in the lab, and many projects are collaborative
by design.
Qualications: We are seeking a highly motivated and
collaborative candidate with a strong background inJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 109
experimental evolutionary biology, especially life-history
evolution. It is desirable if you have basic R program-
ming knowledge and experience of large-scale laboratory
experiments of nematodes or other lab organisms. The
candidate will have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology,
genetics, ecology or a related eld.
Working place: EBC hosts one of the worlds largest
aggregations of evolutionary biologists and Uppsala Uni-
versity was recently ranked 7th in the world in evo-
lutionary biology (CWUR 2017). The Department of
Ecology and Genetics is an international environment
with sta and students from all over the world. Our
research spans from evolutionary ecology and genetics to
studies of ecosystems. A number of high-prole projects
address natural and sexual selection, local adaptation,
speciation, molecular evolution, microbial diversity, and

research focus of the Institute of Population Genetics
is on understanding the genetics of adaptation. This
central question in evolutionary biology is being tackled
using up-to-date methods and a variety of approaches,
including experimental evolution, quantitative genet-
ics, functional genetics, empirical population genetics,
bioinformatics, and statistics.
The successful candidate will be part of a team of scien-
tists studying the adaptation of experimental Drosophila
populations to temperature stress. Since our experi-
mental evolution study is performed under controlled
environmental conditions with a high level of replication
we have a powerful system to successfully employ a com-
bination of DNA sequencing, RNA-Seq, metabolomics
and high-level phenotyping to characterize the archi-
tecture of adaptation in an outcrossing species. With
some of our populations approaching 200 generations,
this project provides the opportunity to follow adaptive
trajectories through time.
We are looking for a candidate with excellent quanti-
tative training and experience in handling large data
sets. A background in population genetics and/or ex-
perience with the analysis of RNA-Seq and Pool-Seq
data are a bonus. Candidates interested to study the
co-evolution of microbiome and host genome are alsoJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 113

RNAseqForNonModelOrganisms
Nov11-15
Course: RNA-seq Analyses in non-model organisms
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
When: 11-15 November 2019
Instructors: Dr. Nicolas Delhomme and Bastian
Schithaler (Umea Plant Science Center, Sweden)
Course overview:
This course provides an overview of modern applica-
tions of transcriptome sequencing and popular tools and
algorithms for exploring transcript reconstruction and
expression analysis in a genome-free manner, leveraging
the Trinity software and analysis framework. Attendees
will perform quality assessment of Illumina RNA-Seq
data, assemble a transcriptome using, among others,
Trinity, quantify transcript expression, leverage Biocon-
ductor tools for dierential expression analysis, and
apply Trinotate to functionally annotate transcripts. In
parallel to the short-read assembly, participants will
perform the pre-processing of 3rd generation sequenc-
ing data (PacBio IsoSeq) and the resulting assemblies
will be compared. Additional methods will then be ex-
plored for characterizing the assembled transcriptome
and revealing biological ndings.
Intended audienceJuly 1, 2019 EvolDir 117
This course is aimed primarily at biologist researchers
that have basic bioinformatics skills and are pursuing
RNA-Seq projects in non-model organisms. Attendees
will gain skills needed to successfully approach tran-
scriptome sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly,
expression analysis, and functional annotation as applied
to organisms lacking a high quality reference genome
sequence. Attendees are also invited to bring a subset
of their own data.
Teaching format
The course will be delivered over the course of four
and a half days, with each session entailing lectures
followed by practical hands-on sessions. Most comput-
ing will be done on the cloud and attendees will use
their own laptop computers with the Google Chrome
web browser providing all the necessary interfaces to
the cloud computing environment, including the linux
command terminal. Attendees can also use the native
terminal emulator of their Operating System (and ssh).
This works natively for Linux, MAC and Windows 10.
For Windows 7 users, installing MobaXTerm would be
recommended.

Crete MorphoPhylogenetics
Nov04-08
Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the course 'MORPHO-
LOGICAL PHYLOGENETICS: PRINCIPLES, APPLI-
CATIONS AND TECHNIQUES'.
Instructors: Dr. Tiago Sim ~Aes (Harvard Univer-
sity, USA) & Oksana Vernygora (University of Alberta,
Canada) Dates: November 4th-8th, 2019 Location:
Crete, Greece
COURSE OVERVIEW: An accurate reconstruction of
evolutionary relationships among species is the corner-
stone of evolutionary biology. Building phylogenetic
trees thus provides the fundamental framework upon
which systematic, biogeographic and evolutionary re-
search operates. Morphological phylogenetics provides
a unique toolkit for inferring relationships, considering
that the vast majority of the species that have ever
lived are now extinct and can only be assessed based on
morphological data. Additionally, combining fossils and
morphological data with molecular data from extant
species is becoming the most comprehensive method of
assessing phylogenetic relationships on deep time and
the time of origin of major evolutionary lineages.
In this course, we will focus on the analysis of morpho-
logical data (and combining morphological data with
molecular data) using multiple optimality criteria for
phylogenetic inference. We will discuss the best avail-
able approaches to construct morphological data sets
and their impact on phylogenies. We will follow with
theory and hands-on practice of phylogenetic programs
using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and
Bayesian inference. Participants will learn how to com-
bine morphological and molecular data for total evidence
analyses, how to conduct time-calibrations using tip and
node dating, dierent birth-death models, morphological
clocks and combined evidence relaxed clock analyses.

SLiMEvolutionaryModeling Nov4-8
Hi all.
First of all, as background: SLiM is a software package
for creating evolutionary models/simulations that are
individual-based and genetically explicit. It is script-
able, exible, fast, and includes an interactive graphical
modeling environment. You can read more about it on
its home page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
November 4-8, 2019, a ve-day SLiM workshop will
be oered at City University of New York (New
York City, USA). It will be hosted by Michael
Hickerson and Connor French, both of CUNY, Brian
Smith of the American Museum of Natural History
(AMNH), and Deren Eaton, of Columbia University.
It will be free, and open to participants outside
of the university. HOWEVER, registration is re-
quired, a limited number of seats are available, and
priority will be given to registrants aliated with
CUNY/Columbia/AMNH. To apply, please send an
email to all ve of us (mhickerson@ccny.cuny.edu,
french.connor.m@gmail.com, bsmith1@amnh.org,
de2356@columbia.edu, bhaller@mac.com) with the info
below. The deadline for applying is the end of the day
on 20 September.
For this workshop, your application email should include:
(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any other
forward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM thatyou hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted. Note that acceptance will likely
be rst-come-rst-served (apart from the priority for
those from the hosting institution), so early application
is advised.
The plan is to try to cover all the major topics in the
SLiM manual, starting with lots of introductory material
to get beginners up to speed with SLiM and its asso-
ciated scripting language Eidos, and hopefully ending
up at advanced topics like non-Wright-Fisher models,
tree-sequence recording, continuous-space models, and
nucleotide-based models. We won't cover everything
in the manual V that would be overwhelming! V but
we'll try to cover all the big topics. There will also be
time for attendees to work on their own models with
help from me, and we may also have time to explore
some optional side topics that are of particular interest
to those attending each workshop. The workshops will
be taught principally using SLiMgui on macOS. It is
not yet determined whether Macs will be provided, or
whether attendees will need to bring their own Mac
laptop. (A Mac is required to run SLiMgui, which is
necessary for teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).
Cheers,
Benjamin C. Haller Messer Lab Cornell University

Course: Introduction to RNA-seq Data Analysis 5-7
August 2019
Where: University of Edinburgh, Kings Buildings, Ed-
inburgh, Scotland
Tutors: Dr Frances Turner, Dr Urmi Trivedi, Dr Nathan
Medd
Overview: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is the method
of choice for transcriptome proling. Nevertheless, it is
a non-trivial task to transform the vast amount of data
obtained with high-throughput sequencers into useful
information. Thus, RNA-seq data analysis is still a
major bottleneck for most researchers in this eld. The
ability of correctly interpreting RNA-seq results, as well
as knowledge on the intrinsic properties of these data,
are essential to avoid incorrect experimental designs and
the application of inappropriate analysis methodologies.
The aim of this workshop is to familiarise researchers
with RNA-seq data and to initiate them in the analysis
by providing lectures and practicals on analysis method-
ologies. In the practicals Illumina-generated sequencing
data and various widely used software programs will be
used.
Registration fee: £500

GROUN: The course is aimed at students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning how to build
a structured pipeline for semi-automated and repro-
ducibile GWAS analyses. It will include information
useful for both beginners and more advanced users. We
will start by introducing general concepts of GWAS and
bioinformatics pipeline building, progressively describ-
ing all steps and putting there seamlessy together in a
general workow. Attendees should have a background
in biology, specically genetics; previous exposure to
GWAS experiments would also be benecial.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category124 EvolDir July 1, 2019
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
