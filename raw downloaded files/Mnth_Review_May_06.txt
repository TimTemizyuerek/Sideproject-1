Bangkok MEEGID VIII Nov30-Dec4
MEEGID VIII Bangkok, Thailand. 30th November-4th
December 2006. Call for conferences/symposia propos-
als and papers
The 8th International Meeting “Molecular Epidemi-
ology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Dis-
eases” (MEEGID VIII) will be held in Bangkok, Thai-
land, 30th November-4th December 2006. As for
the 7 ﬁrst MEEGID meetings, it will be co-organized
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/ ) in Atlanta and the Insti-
tut de Recherche pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD; http:/-
/www.ird.fr/ ) in France. Mahidol University ( http://-
www.mahidol.ac.th/ ) will be an oﬀﬁcial co-organizer of
the meeting, which will be supported also by the French
Embassy ( http://www.ambafrance-th.org/ ).
The MEEGID meetings are organized in syn-
ergy with the new journal Infection, Genetics and
Evolution (Elsevier; http://www.elsevier.com/locate/-
meegid ), which scientiﬁc topic is identical to that of
the MEEGID. Launched only 4 years ago, Infection,
Genetics and Evolution is now published with 6 issues
per year, and is covered by Medline and Index Medicus,
starting from the 1st issue. It has been quoted 3.5/5.0
(“very good”) by the US National Library of Medicine.It is now covered by ISI and an oﬃcial impact index
will be available soon.
Communications on genetics, genomics, proteomics,
population biology, mathematical modelling, bioinfor-
matics are welcome. They can deal with the host, the
pathogen, or the vector in case of vector-borne diseases.
Papers considering host + pathogen or pathogen +
vector (co-evolution) are particularly encouraged. All
pathogens are within the scope of MEEGID: viruses,
parasitic protozoa, helminths, fungal organisms, prion.
All infectious models can be considered, including those
of veterinary or agronomical relevance.
The papers communicated for MEEGID VIII will be
published in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and
Evolution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002). MEEGID VIII will include 10-15 plenary lec-
tures, about 20 specialized symposia, 12-15 “express-
debates” (20 mn presentation by only one speaker fol-
lowed by 40 mn free discussion) and several poster ses-
sions.
Special emphasis through plenary lectures and sym-
posia will be given to health problems of particular
interest to Thailand and South-East Asia: avian ﬂu,
SARS, malaria, dengue, tuberculosis. Pleanary lec-
tures and symposia will also deal with trasnversal topics
such as population genetics or species concepts. The
congress is still open to proposals of conferences and
symposia.
Awards will be attributed to the best communication,May 1, 2006 EvolDir 3
the best communication by a student and the best com-
munication by a scientist from the Southern World on
a problem speciﬁcally relevant to these areas.
For the ﬁrst time, a satellite meeting will be organized
in the framework of MEEGID VIII by the think tank
“Biology, Medicine and Society”. Societal problems
linked to genetics, evolution and transmissible diseases
will be discussed in several roundtables.
Abstract submission deadline: 30th September.
Registration Fee: 200.00 euros or equivalent in other
currencies; Students pay only meals and coﬀee breaks
Place: The Royal River Hotel http://-

FINAL REMINDER AND CALL FOR REGIS-
TRANTS4 EvolDir May 1, 2006
The Brock University Department of Biological Sci-
ences is proud to be hosting the 2006 Ontario Ecology
and Ethology Colloquium.
This is a conference organized by graduate students
to provide graduate and advanced undergraduate stu-
dents, at any stage in their thesis research, the opportu-
nity to present in a supportive atmosphere dominated
by student peers and friendly faculty. The conference
location rotates around Ontario. In May 2005 it was
hosted by Carlton University; in May 2004 it was hosted
by University of Toronto at Mississauga. This confer-
ence encompasses all aspects of ecology, behaviour, and
evolution. This is also one of the largest regional gradu-
ate student run conferences in North America on these
topics.
This year we are honoured to have 4 plenary speakers:
Barbara Rosemary Grant, Princeton University; Ellie
Prepas, Lakehead University; Linda Corkum, Univer-
sity of Windsor; and Marie-Jos´ ee Fortin, University of
Toronto.
This years conference will be held May 5 to May 7 2006.
Early registration and abstract submission deadline is
April 14, 2006. All information is available on the web-
sitewww.oeec.ca . Thanks very much,

Herewith we would like to remind you on the *dead-
line for submission of talks/posters and the deadline
for reduced fee registration (31.3.2006)* for the
*19^th Annual Meeting of the Plant Population Biol-
ogy Meeting of the Ecological Society of **Germany**,
**Switzerland** and **Austria** (GfOe),*
taking place in Halle, Germany, from 24 May to 27 May
2006 organized jointly by the UFZ-Centre for Environ-
mental Research and the Geobotanical Institute of the
University of Halle.
The annual meeting is being held in English and usu-
ally attended by more than one hundred people from
all over Europe. Priority is given to young researchers
to present results from their PhD theses. The focus
of the meeting in 2006 is on interactions of plants withother species, recognizing that plants have to cope with
a large number of competitors, herbivores, pathogens
and symbionts. Therefore, to understand the popula-
tion biology of plants, botanist would have to broaden
their scope and incorporate these interactors in their
studies. Presentations from the whole ﬁeld of plant
population biology are welcome.
Keynote speakers include: - *Claire de Mazancourt*,
Imperial College at Silwood Park - *Jacqui Shykoﬀ*,
CNRS-Paris - *J¨ urgen Kroymann*, Max Planck Insti-
tute for Chemical Ecology, Jena - *Amots Dafni*, Uni-
versity of Haifa

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS:
RE: 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
RODENT BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
Dear Colleagues, We envision bringing together a sym-
posium at the 3rd International Conference on Rodent
Biology and Management, to be held 28th August to
1st September 2006, Hanoi, Vietnam.
Our symposium would be one of many that deal with
aspects of the biology and management of rodents
worldwide.
The symposium ’Adaptation and Diversiﬁcation in Ro-
dents’, which we envision, shall bring together presen-
tations on ﬁndings derived from the molecular analy-
sis of adaptation in rodents. In other words, we are
keen on bringing together studies on adaptive molecu-
lar evolution in rodents. Examples of such studies range
from the selection for resistance to rodenticides, coat
color variation, phylogeography, and other examples of
molecular evolution in rodent species. Because of their
potential to identify genes underlying adaptation, we
are particularly intrigued by studies that have the iden-May 1, 2006 EvolDir 5
tiﬁcation of functional genetic diﬀerences between ro-
dent populations and species to their focus. Note that
a symposium on the Evolutionary Biology and System-
atics, chaired by Ken Aplin (Ken.Aplin@csiro.au), also
will be held in conjunction with this symposium, and
you will be able to attend both symposia.
We strongly feel that there are numerous possibilities
for presentations that would ﬁt within our symposium.
Potentially, the mechanisms and evolution of rodenti-
cide resistance, the mapping and identiﬁcation of its
genetic underpinnings, and the patterns of selection on
the locus, might merit their own symposium. This will
depend on the number of scientists who express interest
in a separate session.
We cordially invite you to join us in our eﬀort to make
this a great symposium by contributing a paper. We
encourage you, or any of your students or postdocs, to
contact us at your earliest convenience with informal in-
quiries or abstracts on work in this or related research
areas. Opportunities for funding for student travel are
in place.
Seehttp://icrbm2006.ioz.ac.cn/index.html for informa-
tion on this conference, and please note these critical
dates: 1 June 2006 (Deadline submission of abstracts
for oral or poster presentation), 22 June (Deadline for
early registration). 1 May (Deadline for submission of
applications for developing country & student travel
support).
We are looking forward to hear from you.
Thank you very much for your consideration.

Mark your calendars: the Australasian section of the
Society for Conservation Biology invites you to its in-
augural regional meeting of conservation scientists
When: July 10-13, 2007
Where: University of New South Wales, Sydney, Aus-
tralia
Topic: The Biodiversity Extinction Crisis, a Paciﬁc and
Australasian response
The world faces its sixth great extinction event, driven
mainly by humans. Our region faces special challenges
including: island ecology, rising sea levels, changing
rainfall, and land and water degradation. These issues
are overlaid by the general problems of habitat loss and
fragmentation, invasive species, pollution and overhar-
vesting.
This conference identiﬁes the major problems for biodi-
versity conservation in our region, existing and poten-
tial solutions and links to the global biodiversity ini-
tiatives. Real opportunities can be found in the nexus
between conservation science and policy-makers, man-May 1, 2006 EvolDir 9
agers and the community. There will be ﬁve major
themes: (1) Regional challenges (particular issues for
our part of the world); (2) Managing threatening pro-
cess of universal importance; (3) Case studies of con-
servation in action, including biodiversity monitoring
and assessment; (4) Conservation science and policy
and; (5) Conservation science and the community (non-
government organisations, indigenous people).
Information on the meeting, as well as registration and
abstract submission will be forthcoming.
We look forward to seeing you in Sydney in 2007

stitute of Integrative Biology / Department of Aquatic
Ecology, EAWAG)
Our group is focused on evolutionary ecology of host
parasite interactions. We study ecological genetics of
immunesystem function, maintenance of sexual repro-
duction by coevolution between host and the parasite,
and genetic architecture of infectivity in parasites with
multiple host life-cycles. We are looking for a student
who is interested in genetics, immunology, ecology and
evolutionary biology of host-parasite interactions. We
provide a stimulating research environment, demanding
but supportive supervision and well-worked out model
systems for research. Position is available for 3 years,

2 PhD positions in plant reproductive ecology at ETH
Z¨ urich
Two PhD positions funded by the SNF are available at
the plant ecological genetics group at the ETH Z¨ urich
(Switzerland) to study the molecular basis and evolu-
tionary ecology of plant-pollinator interactions in Si-
lene. One PhD project will focus on the idenﬁcation of
odor genes, by transcript proﬁling and functional study
of candidate genes. For this project I am looking for
one candidate with a background in molecular biology
(ecology) or biochemistry, organism biology with good
knowledge of molecular techniques.
The second project will investigate mechanisms and
consequences of speciﬁc pollinator attraction in a Si-
lene species-pair, involving investigations on ﬂoral sig-
nals (scent), behavioural experiments with pollinators
and plot experiments in the ﬁeld. For this PhD, a back-
ground in (chemical) ecology, evolution, or plant/insect
biology etc. is desirable. The two PhD candidates are
expected to closely collaborate with each other.
The two projects are embedded in a larger framework of
evolutionary studies in Silene. ( www.geobot.ethz.ch ).
We are currently a group of 3 academic staﬀ one
PostDoc, and 5 PhD students that use Silene as a
model system to investigate topics such as pollinator
mediated selection, reproductive isolation, hybridisa-
tion, and habitat adaptation. The institute houses
modern molecular and chemical ecology labs, includ-
ing a wind tunnel for behavioural experiments with
pollinators. Greenhouses and climate chambers for
plant cultivation are also available. Z¨ urich has a
large and very active research community at the ETH
(www.ethz.ch <http://www.ethz.ch/ >) and Univer-
sity of Z¨ urich (www.unizh.ch <http://www.unizh.ch/-
>) dealing with various aspects of organismal and
molecular biology ( www.lifescience-zurich.ch <http:/-
/www.lifescience-zurich.ch/ >). The city also oﬀers ex-
cellent quality of life through active cultural programs
and infrastructure, as well as an attractive surrounding
including the alps in proximity.
If you are interested in one of the jobs, please send a let-
ter describing your motivation for the application, C.V.,
copy of degrees, publications (manuscripts) if any, and
e-mail addresses of two academic referees. If you have
further question, don‘t hesitate to contact me.14 EvolDir May 1, 2006

ETH Zurich InsectBehaviour
We are seeking a motivated and creative PhD Student
in Entomology with a Diploma degree in Biology or
related University degree.
The PhD project will focus on insect mobility of an
invasive herbivore pest species of fruit trees. Mobility
will be quantiﬁed in the laboratory with a computer-
linked actograph, and strains of diverging mobility will
be bred by selection. Such strains will be used to ad-
dress challenging questions on trade-oﬀs between dis-
persal and reproductive performance. Further, insects
will be sampled in the ﬁeld from core and peripheral re-
gions. They will be categorized according to their mo-
bility, and their genetic diﬀerentiation assessed using
molecular markers. Results are expected to contribute
to a better understanding of the behavioural ecology of
insect dispersal and to improve sustainable pest man-
agement.
Languages spoken in the group are mainly German and
English.
Education: Diploma degree (or MSc) in Biology or re-
lated University Degree. Start: Position open until
ﬁlled, immediate start possible.

(BIOPOOL). The main hypotheses are to (1) character-
ize the relative importance of dispersal (determined by
regional factors), historical eﬀects (i.e. priority eﬀects,
mediated by propagule-banks build up) and assemblage
processes (driven by local factors) on biodiversity, and
(2) to quantify the eﬀect of diversity and genetic vari-
ation on ecosystem functioning.
Microcrustaceans, such as Daphnia, are ideal model or-
ganisms since they are well suited for laboratory and
ﬁeld (quantitative genetic) experiments and many ge-
netic markers and techniques have been developed.
Speciﬁcally, we would like to a) monitor species and
clonal establishment in newly created habitats during
two or three consecutive years, and b) to monitor artiﬁ-
cial communities (inoculated with diﬀerent genotypes)
through time using molecular markers.
The successful candidate should have the equivalent of
a master’s degree or diploma in Biology, a ﬁrm back-
ground in evolutionary biology, experience with molec-
ular techniques and a strong commitment to basic re-
search. The position is open starting May/June 2006
and available initially for two years, with likely exten-
sion for maximum one further year. Pay and conditions
are according to the German BAT-IIa/2 scale for civil
servants (ca. ??? 18K p.a. net income, depending on
family status).
Interested applicants should send the following informa-

PhD FELLOWSHIP IN CAENORHABDITIS EVO-
LUTION Jacques Monod Institute, Paris Dr. Marie-
Anne Felix (felix@ijm.jussieu.fr)
A PhD fellowship is available in the laboratory of
Marie-Anne Felix at the Jacques Monod Institute in
Paris, France, from 1st October 2006.
The funded research project concerns the evolution of
the molecular network underlying vulval development
in the nematode genus Caenorhabditis. In C. elegans,
an intercellular signaling network including Ras, Notch
and Wnt pathways determines cell fates of the vulval
precursors. From preliminary work, it is clear that this
intercellular signaling system varies among species of
the Caenorhabditis genus, including large variations in
C. briggsae and C. remanei (whose genomes are se-
quenced) compared to C. elegans. These variations in
developmental mechanism can be described as quanti-
tative changes in the relative activities and crosstalks
between signaling pathways. In this evolutionary sys-
tems biology perspective, the student will determine
the relative roles and activities of these molecular path-
ways in the diﬀerent Caenorhabditis species, and use
the known Caenorhabditis phylogeny to polarize evolu-
tionary changes in the network.

LeidenU EvolBirdsong
Two PhD positions available
Closing date: 30 April 2006.
Behavioural Biology, Institute of Biology, Leiden Uni-
versity
BIRDSONG, SPEECH AND LANGUAGE Human
speech and birdsong share several striking similarities
which are such that learned birdsong is considered to be
the closest animal analogue to language and both lin-
guists and biologists have suggested that results from
one ﬁeld could yield hypotheses, or even answers to
questions, for the other. The following two projects,
for which we seek candidates, also aim to contribute to
this rapidly growing ﬁeld of comparative research.
1 - Bird song structure and language syntax: a com-
parative interdisciplinary approach.
One key feature distinguishing human language from
other animal vocal communication systems concerns
the presence of a rule based syntax underlying lin-
guistic utterances. But are humans really unique in
their abilities to detect and use syntactical rules, or do
they share some of these properties with other species?
This project will address this issue by analyzing the
syntactical abilities of a songbird, the zebra ﬁnch. It
will focus on two questions: 1) Are zebra ﬁnches ca-
pable of detecting and distinguishing between diﬀer-
ent types of (experimentally constructed) grammars?
2) What are the species speciﬁc grammar rules which
guide zebra ﬁnch song production and development?
The project will involve a bioacoustic analysis of song
structure in zebra ﬁnches, diﬀerent types of experi-
ments to analyze syntactical capabilities (e.g. habitua-
tion/dishabituation tasks, operant tasks involving dis-
crimination learning, etc.) and developmental studies
on the role of experience in structuring song syntax.
2 - Bird Speech? On the production and perception of
formants in bird vocalisations.
Human speech conveys language, and much research
eﬀort concerns the production and perception of acous-
tic features that encode linguistic meaning in speech.
An important feature are formants, which are time-
varying frequency bands that are emphasized in the
broad-band spectrum of speech. Formant patterns re-
sult from acoustic resonances of the vocal tract, thecharacteristics of which are rapidly modulated using
articulators such as the tongue, lips, and soft palate.
Studies of birdsong have hardly addressed the role of
formants, although several ﬁndings indicate their pres-
ence. The proposed project aims to provide a com-
prehensive analysis of formant mechanisms in birds. It
will address the following questions: 1) To what ex-
tent do vocal tract resonances cause formant patterns
in natural bird vocalizations, and how do vocal tract
articulators modulate such patterns? 2) What are the
perceptual sensitivities of birds to formant patterns in
natural bird vocalizations? 3) Are formant patterns in
natural bird vocalizations aﬀected by vocal production
learning? The project will involve morphological, phys-
iological and bioacoustical analyses and experimental
studies on the vocalization systems of zebra ﬁnches and
budgerigars, together with experiments on the percep-
tion of formant variants.
The projects are based in the research group Be-
havioural Biology. This is an active, internation-
ally oriented research group with a strong focus on
(vocal) communication in animals. The group cur-
rently consists of three tenured staﬀ, several post-
docs, PhD students and MSc-students. More informa-
tion: http://biology.leidenuniv.nl/ibl/S8/index.html
Requirements: Candidates are expected to have an
MSc (drs) degree in Biology, Linguistics (phonet-
ics/phonology) or other relevant discipline; to have a
strong interest in experimental and interdisciplinary
studies, and to be interested in international collabo-
ration (part of project 2 will be carried out in collab-
oration with research groups in Germany (Dr Beckers,
Seewiesen) and the US).
Appointment: The appointment is for a period of 4
years and is expected to lead to completion of a disser-
tation. The gross monthly salary is 1.877 in the ﬁrst
year and increases progressively each year to 2.407 in
the fourth year. Salary and fringe beneﬁts conform to
the Collective Employment Agreement for Dutch Uni-
versities. We hope to ﬁll the vacancies as soon as pos-
sible.
Applications: Written applications (mentioning
BehavBiol-PhD-1 and/or -2), including a CV with
marks obtained and the names, telephone numbers
and email addresses of at least two referees (who
have agreed to be contacted) should be submitted to:

LiverpoolU Coevolution
Experimental coevolution with multiple parasites
Dr. M.A. Brockhurst
(michael.brockhurst@liverpool.ac.uk), Dr. A. Fen-
ton (a.fenton@liverpool.ac.uk)
Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites,
the reciprocal evolution of host defence and parasite
counter-defence, is ubiquitous and there is a consider-
able body of work exploring this issue in simple one-
host-one-parasite systems (e.g., Sasaki 2000; Restif &
Koella 2003). However, coevolution with multiple par-
asite species is likely to be a major selection pressure
for host organisms in nature ? there may be various
positive and negative interactions, each modifying the
optimal strategies of the component species, aﬀecting
the evolutionary dynamics of the community. While ex-
posure to multiple parasites is likely to have far reach-
ing ecological, evolutionary and health implications no
experimental studies (and few theoretical ones) have
looked at coevolution between a host species and mul-
tiple parasite species.
An experimental evolution approach using populations
of bacteria and their viral parasites (bacteriophage) is
ideal for studying host-parasite coevolution, due to the
rapid generation time of hosts and parasites, and the
ease of experimental manipulation. We have previously
demonstrated rapid coevolution between Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens and phage phi2 (Brockhurst et al. 2003).
This project will extend previous ﬁndings using a mix-
ture of experimentation and theory to investigate the
eﬀect of exposure to multiple parasite species on: i) co-
evolutionary dynamics; ii) resistance evolution includ-
ing costs and epistasis; iii) host and parasite local adap-
tation. As such, this project brings together ideas con-
cerning host-parasite coevolution, the evolution of life
history strategies and community ecology and will ap-
peal to anyone interested in testing evolutionary theory.

RoyalHolloway ModellingDisease
Call for applications to a PhD studentship on:
Modelling the dynamics of disease propagation on so-
cial networks“
This project aims to model the spread of diseases on
social networks. This is an area in which there is cur-
rently much interest, both from a theoretical and ap-
plied point of view. Within this project we will study
the spread of infectious agents on networks. As a bio-
logical inspiration we will use the spread of diseases like
measles in the human population, and how this spread
is aﬀected by control measures that humans can exert18 EvolDir May 1, 2006
in order to inﬂuence their chances of becoming infected.
By introducing this extra complexity in the spread of
the disease we will need to introduce elements of game
theory in the modeling. We aim to gain insight in the
general principles underlying the epidemiology of dis-
ease and the importance of network structure therein
by modelling such systems by means of simple mathe-
matical models or simulation models.
This project is part of an interdisciplinary study
in which the dynamic behaviour of large interact-
ing systems on random networks is studied and is
funded by the EPSRC under their Novel Computa-
tion initiative at Royal Holloway and the Universi-
ties of Sheﬃeld, Leeds and Southampton (see http://-
amorph.group.shef.ac.uk/ for further details about this
programme). Close interaction with a postdoctoral re-
search assistant at Royal Holloway, and similar groups
in Leeds, Sheﬃeld and Southampton is expected. The
project is suitable for those with a degree (UK equiv-
alent 2.1 or higher) in a quantitative science such as
Mathematics, Physics or Computer Science and who
have an aﬃnity to biology and epidemiology, or for Biol-
ogy graduates with a proven ability to work with math-
ematical models or computer models. The studentship
is fully funded, EPSRC eligibility criteria apply, i.e. the
studentship is open to those with a relevant connection
with the United Kingdom (UK), usually through resi-
dence. For further information about the studentship

StockholmU Phenotypic
polymorphism
PhD Position in Theoretical Evolutionary Biology
Stockholm University
The evolution of phenotypic polymorphism
A PhD position in theoretical evolutionary biology is
available at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm Uni-
versity, Sweden. Research topics for the position in-
clude the evolution of phenotypic polymorphism and
the evolution of individual variability, viewed from the
perspective of modern developmental biology.
Phenotypic polymorphism is a widespread phe-
nomenon, with examples like males and females in sex-
ual species, alternative male mating types and winged
and wingless individuals in certain insects. Variation
in so-called personality between individuals of social
species could also be regarded as phenotypic polymor-
phism. The basic issue concerns the evolution and de-
velopment of alternative phenotypes, in particular, the
evolution of developmental systems of phenotype de-
termination. Such systems can implement genetically
controlled polymorphisms and phenotypic plasticity, as
well as stochastic (randomizing or bet-hedging) poly-
morphisms.May 1, 2006 EvolDir 19
The position can be either full-time over four years or
80% over ﬁve years (with a possibility of 20% teaching
assistantship), with a starting full-time yearly salary of
232800 SEK (around 24800 EUR). The starting date is
ﬂexible, but should be in the second half of 2006. Ap-
plicants should have a MSc (or equivalent background)
in a ﬁeld like evolution, ecology or population genetics,
or possibly physics and applied mathematics. Candi-
dates with a strong interest in evolutionary theory and
good conceptual, analytical and computer program-
ming skills are preferred. The position is open until
ﬁlled, but primary consideration will be given to ap-
plications received by 15 May 2006. To apply, send a
signed letter of application, containing a statement of
research interests and skills, addressed to the Head of
the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, SE-

THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF AGING
A PhD studentship, concerning the ecology and evo-
lution of aging, is available from October 2006 for an
applicant from the UK or EU, under the supervision
of Dr. Steven Sait and Dr. Ian Hope at The Univer-
sity of Leeds and Dr. Mike Boots at the University of
Sheﬃeld.
BACKGROUND The evolution of ageing remains one
of the most challenging of research topics today. Theory
predicts that populations experiencing high mortality
due to external factors (e.g. from disease or compe-
tition) evolve earlier maturity and invest more in re-
production. Theory also assumes that individuals are
equally vulnerable to external mortality. However, sev-
eral papers have recently demonstrated that the pat-
tern of ageing evolution is sensitive to complexities as-
sociated with age-dependent vulnerability to mortality.
The project will investigate the feedback between the
individual and the population in variable environments
and explore the impact of contrasting selection pres-
sures on the evolution of ageing.
This project will use the nematode worm Caenorhab-
ditis elegans as a model species, for which the conser-
vation of ageing mechanisms is astonishingly conserved
from worm to man. The project will investigate the
ecology and evolution of ageing of C. elegans over mul-
tiple generations and for a range of environmental con-
ditions, combining population ecology of model systems
with genome analysis of C. elegans.
The project takes place within the context of vibrant
and diverse research on ecology, evolution, genetics and
genomics. In addition to the postgraduate training pro-
gramme, the student would receive training in molec-
ular and genomics approaches, including their appli-
cation in ecology and evolution, as well as opportuni-
ties to develop models and theory with collaborators at
Sheﬃeld. The student would become familiar with ex-
perimental design and complex statistical analyses, as
well the presentation of results to a variety of audiences
and in a variety of formats. This broad research experi-
ence will beneﬁt further by extensive interactions with
two other related PhD projects and partners at Sheﬃeld
and York within a White Rose-funded network.22 EvolDir May 1, 2006

www.univ-lille1.fr/gepv A PhD studentship is available
at the University of Lille, France, for an applicant from
a foreign European country to work on “The evolu-
tion of ﬂowering time in perennials: Beta vulgaris vs.
Arabidopsis thaliana” in the group of Prof. Henk van
Dijk, Laboratoire de Genetique et Evolution des Popu-
lations Vegetales, UMR CNRS 8016, Villeneuve d’Ascq,
France.
For plants living in a seasonal environment informa-
tion about the progress of the season is crucial in order
to ﬂower at the right moment. In the course of evo-
lution sophisticated mechanisms have been developed,
especially with respect to temperature and day length.
The most important genes involved in the sensitivity to
these environmental cues are now known, in particular
in the annual plant model species Arabidopsis thaliana.
The sea beet, Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima, the an-
cestor of cultivated beet, is an iteroparous perennial.The data on B. vulgaris available in our group suggest
that perennials and annuals diﬀer in certain aspects of
the mechanism of ﬂowering initiation. The plausible ar-
gument behind this diﬀerence is that perennials should
also to invest in survival in order to get oﬀspring later
in life and therefore should be more restrictive in the
conditions for starting ﬂowering. An interesting point is
the memory of winter (vernalization) which is based on
an epigenetic mechanism. In A. thaliana the epigenetic
state is reset every generation during meiosis in order
to regain the non-vernalized state for the new seedling.
A perennial plant, on the contrary, would be better oﬀ
by regaining the vegetative stage each summer, thus
being able to become prepared for the coming winter.
The epigenetic mechanism could therefore be regulated
in an essentially diﬀerent way.
The main aspects of this thesis are the analysis of
crosses, both on the phenotypic and the molecular level;
the search for homology with A. thaliana and the inter-
pretation of the results in an ecological and evolution-
ary perspective.
The successful applicant should have some practical ex-
perience in standard molecular biology techniques, but
also be interested in how natural selection happens in
the ﬁeld.

terest and CV to Prof. Henk van Dijk, henk.van-

A major focus of our research is the genomics, molec-
ular genetic and evolution of symbiotic fungi, com-
bining information on gene polymorphism at intra-
speciﬁc level and gene function with studies of cellular
and molecular imaging. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
(AMF) are known to form symbiotic associations with
more 80% of plant species, increasing the ability of rootsMay 1, 2006 EvolDir 23
to explore a soil volume for immobile phosphorus. The
objective of our research is to analyze AMF genetics

group of fungi has co-evolved with plants. The applica-
tion of live cellular and molecular imaging technologies
will be necessary in order to elucidate their mode of
reproduction in the absence of sex.
We are looking for candidates with strong laboratory
expertise in molecular genetics and genomics, a solid
theoretical background in evolutionary biology, as well
as expertise in bioinformatics. The start date is ﬂexible.

UPlymouth TermitePopulations
PhD position, University of Plymouth & The Natural
History Museum, London
Stipend: £13,750 per annum for 36 months
We are seeking an independent and motivated gradu-
ate to ﬁll a NERC CASE studentship investigating rain
forest termite community structure. Candidates should
have a demonstrable enthusiasm for insect ecology, tax-
onomy, and/or community ecology, and a minimum of
an upper second class degree in Biology, Ecology or a
related subject. Usually only UK students are eligible
to apply due. The project is a joint venture between
Dr Mairi Knight, Dr Sarah Donovan and Prof. Rod
Blackshaw at the University of Plymouth, and Dr Paul
Eggleton at the Natural History Museum, London.
Project background Termites are highly abundant inlowland tropical rainforests. In their role as ecosystem
engineers they have a major inﬂuence on soil structure,
plant decomposition, carbon mineralisation, nutrient
availability and the stimulation of microbial activity.
As key soil invertebrates, termite diversity patterns are
well characterised at regional and global spatial scales.
However, two major questions remain unanswered: (1)
How big are colonies? (2) How are those colonies dis-
tributed in the soil? Our lack of knowledge of these pa-
rameters has been identiﬁed as a major obstacle to our
understanding of fundamental ecological processes, and
of the factors driving population distributions. This
studentship will tackle these two questions directly, us-
ing a combination of ﬁeld surveys, taxonomic tools,
molecular techniques (microsatellite markers) and spa-
tial analyses. Over the three year period the successful
candidate will spend roughly one third of their time
working at the Natural History Museum, London, one
third in the School of Biology at the University of Ply-
mouth, and the other third conducting ﬁeld work (in
Cameroon and Malaysian Borneo).
Experience required Full training will be given in all
techniques, as well as initial assistance in the ﬁeld, so
no previous experience in insect identiﬁcation, spatial
analyses or molecular ecology is essential. Experience
in any of these areas would, however, be an advan-
tage. The candidate will be expected to spend con-
siderable periods of time working in potentially basic
and/or challenging tropical ﬁeld conditions.
Application procedure Interviews will be held on the
3 May 2006 in Plymouth with an anticipated start
date of October 2006. Applicants should send a
curriculum vitae with the names and addresses (in-
cluding email) of three referees along with a cover-
ing letter to Dr Mairi Knight, School of Biological
Sciences, University of Plymouth, Drake Circus, Ply-
mouth, PL4 8AA. Applications should be submitted

a PhD, who wants to participate in ecological research
but is not interested in pursuing an independent re-
search career. That applicant could be considered as a
Lab Manager. Alternatively, a person with laboratory
skills but no research experience could be considered as
a research technician.
The tasks include: - assistance in animal breeding
(freshwater invertebrates) - ﬁeld work (New Zealand,
Switzerland, Finland) - allozyme electrophoresis (one
of the main tasks) - work at the molecular genetics lab-
oratory (PCR, microsatellites, AFLP’s, etc.) - basic
protein electrophoresis (SDS-page, 2D electrophoresis)May 1, 2006 EvolDir 27
- training and supervision of laboratory work conducted
by PhD- and Masters students - supervision and orga-
nization of the laboratory work in the group of Prof.
Jukka Jokela
Training for the above tasks is provided by the group.
Initially the position will be available as a part time job
(60%, e.g. 3 days/week), but it’s likely to change to a
full time employment later in 2006.
Eawag’s Aquatic Ecology department houses 10 re-
search groups in diverse ﬁelds of Aquatic Ecology. Our
15 - 20 PhD students work on projects varying from
ecosystem processes to molecular genetics, and our 7 - 9
technicians participate in challenging tasks of ﬁeld and
laboratory research. The research group of Prof. Jokela
is focused on the role of coevolution for maintenance of
sexual morphs in the New Zealand snail Potamopyrgus
antipodarum. This is a long term research project with
a unique mix of genetic and ecological questions and
data. The project provides challenging ﬁeld work in
New Zealand (6 weeks / year) and intensive laboratory
work on genotyping the ﬁeld samples. Willingness to
function as a coauthor in the resulting publications is a
bonus. This project will continue for 3 - 5 years and the
person is expected to be available for at least 3 years.
The position will be available for the beginning of May
2006. Working language in the group is English and
the position is open to all nationalities.
Your CV and application letter (including a descrip-
tion of your speciﬁc skills as well as names and ad-
dresses of 2 references) should be sent to: chris-
tiane.rapin“at”eawag.ch
Your applications should reach us no later than April
30, but the search will continue until a suitable candi-
date has been found.

The group Plancton Oceanique at the SBR in Brittany,
France, is a one of the world leader in the ﬁelds of
molecular ecology, evolution, and physiology of marine
unicellular plankton ( http://www.sb-roscoﬀ.fr/Phyto/-
). The new team Plankton Evolution and Paleoceans
(PI: Colomban de Vargas; Research Engineer: Ian
Probert; PhD students: Miguel Frada and Hui Liu) ex-
plores key aspects of the biological, functional, and eco-
logical diversities within the two main groups of pelagic
micro-calciﬁers: the coccolithophores and foraminifers.
Having built kilometers-thick, exceptionally well pre-
served carbonate deposits at the ocean ﬂoor, these pro-
tists have played a fundamental role in the ecology and
geology of Earth System for the last ~200 My. The bio-
logical (genomic, physiological, ecological, biogeograph-
ical), chemical (trace elements and isotopes within the
micro-skeletons), and morphological (optical and elec-
tron microscopy) information we extract from living
species are used to assess their mode and rate of evolu-
tion, and to re-interpret their fossil record and impact
on biogeochemical cycles.
PhD project: Role of Red-Queen selection, life cycle,
and sex in the evolution of marine pelagic viruses and
their hosts (coccolithophores).
This project will be co-supervised by Colomban de Var-

Project Abstract: Modern optical and genomic tech-
niques have revealed extremely abundant and diverse
marine planktonic viruses. Although the inﬂuence of
viruses on marine geochemical cycles (via the regu-
lation of host populations), and prokaryote evolution
(via lateral gene transfer), is well recognized, the pro-
cesses creating and maintaining such huge oceanic vi-
ral diversity, including its rate of evolution, are largely
unknown. Mechanisms of co-evolution between hosts
and their viruses, where both are ﬁghting to respec-
tively decrease and increase virulence, are certainly
playing critical roles. We propose to test two main hy-
potheses, using the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi
as model: (A) virulence in pelagic host-virus interac-
tions is highly speciﬁc, constrained by the boundaries
between species, sub-species, or strains; (B) virulence
is not species speciﬁc, but life-stages speciﬁc, and thus
constrained by the sexual alternation between haploid
and diploid populations. Experiments will test if Red-
Queen processes are driving ecological/evolutionary di-
versiﬁcation in coccolithoviruses and their hosts, and
will address whether host evolution is driven by rapid
genomic mutations, or rather by genomic restructur-
ing through haploidization and/or genetic recombina-
tion associated with sex. Results will enhance our un-
derstanding of the nature and tempo of evolution of
planktonic host-virus interactions.

lutionary Biology” of the Biological School, University
of Muenster, Germany. Within IEB, the Plant Evolu-
tionary Ecology department is inviting applications for
a
Research fellow position in PLANT EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGY
The position starts on 1 September 2006, is non-
permanent and may be extended to a maximum of ﬁve
years. The salary is according to the German civil ser-
vant scale A13, thus approximately 45 000 Euro gross
per year. The position is comparable to the level of an
assistant professor in non-German academic systems.
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic can-
didate who is expected to develop his/her own research
line including the acquisition of funding. Subjects that
would ﬁt particularly well into our group include
- the evolution of plant mating systems - plant
metapopulation structure and dispersal - ecological and
conservation genetics - evolution of host-parasite or
plant-animal interactions - ecological and environmen-
tal genomics
The successful candidate must have a PhD or doctorate
in Biology and a strong publication record in relation to
his/her biographic phase. The position includes teach-
ing in elementary and biodiversity aspects of botany,
teaching experience would thus be advantageous. S/he
will be encouraged to guide graduate students from our
MSc and PhD programs and to participate in collab-
orative funding initiatives that are currently set up at
the Biological Faculty and with the IEB as a key player.
The Plant Evolutionary Ecology Group has just started
to establish this novel department. Our young group
is one of four existing groups in the newly foundedInstitute of Evolution and Biodiversity at the Univer-
sity of Muenster (see www.uni-muenster.de/evolution/-
). When fully grown, the institute is planned to en-
compass 5 full groups and two junior groups working
on diverse aspects of the evolution of biodiversity. The
institute will be equipped with a central molecular ge-
netic laboratory, physiological and microscopy labora-
tories, greenhouses and climate chambers. We intend to
create a lively and stimulating work environment pro-
moting the study of all aspects of modern evolutionary
biology.
Working language in the group is English and the po-
sition is open to all nationalities. The university is
an equal opportunity employer. Female candidates are
particularly encouraged to apply.
Please address further inquiries to Thorsten Reusch (see

ABI3100 Fluorescent Dyes
dear all, I want to use the full potential of the
ABI3100 sequencer for AFLP-fragment analysis with
the four dyes 6FAM (blue), VIC (green), NED (yel-
low), PET(red), plus LIZ-size standard. Is there any
experience with respect to which dye is preferable for
which selective primer? At the ECO-RI side we rou-
tinely use three selective bases with “A” as ﬁrst base
(AAC, AAG, ACA, ACC, ACG, ACT, AGC, AGG).
What about other selective motifes (e.g. CAG)?

Our department has recently purchased an ABI 3130xl
for DNA sequencing and fragment analysis. We expect
that our usage of the instrument will vary, and there
may be some weeks where it is only needed for a few
runs. Given that, we would like to minimize our costs
for consumable reagents, particularly polymer. ABI
suggests changing any polymer bottle that has been
on the instrument more than a week. Has anyone tried
running the instrument with older polymer? If so, how
old? Any adverse eﬀects on the data or the instrument?
Also, any other tips for saving on reagents during peri-
ods of inconsistent use would be greatly appreciated.

ABI3130 costs answers
Hi all,
Thank you for the many helpful suggestions for maxi-
mizing the eﬃciency of our ABI 3130 polymer (POP7)
use. Below you can see my original question along with42 EvolDir May 1, 2006

We also are running a 3130xl and I’ve found that the
polymer works ﬁne for 10 days. After that, the peaks
get wide and more diﬃcult to read. We only ﬁll the
polymer bottle up to how much we think we’re going
to use in 10 days (but that’s diﬃcult to determine due
to unpredictable use).
Good luck, Caren Goldberg University of Idaho

We have had similar issues concerning the varying usage
level of ABI. We have tried the following 2 approaches
of which the latter we are now applying. At ﬁrst we kept
the full polymer bottle that was in use in a fridge and
had water bottle attached inside the machine. Then
replaced the water bottle with polymer bottle when
starting run. This however resulted in considerably
faster electrophoresis runtime and subsequently the re-
sults were bad. Bad meaning that as normal runtime
for GS 500LIZ to travel throuhg capillaries would be
around 6000 datapoints the runtimes varied from 2500
to 5500 datapoints. This in turn results inconsistent in
respect to fragment lengths between runs! The reason
probably is that polymer became diluted as water was
let to system. Now we are doing the following which
seems to work ﬁne. We have the ’full’ polymer bot-
tle in fridge and ’empty’ polymer bottle attached to
machine. ’Empty’ polymer bottle always contains a
minimum amount of polymer enough to have the tip
of tube to be embedded in polymer thus preventing
airbubbles to appear in system. Then depending on
how many runs needs to be done and whether bubble
removes etc. needs to be done we add the appropri-
ate amount of polymer by pipetting with pipette with
truncated tip. There is always some ’old’ polymer inthe bottle but as long as you run few runs per week this
polymer should always change and should not result in
elongated runtimes. If polymer gets old then you will
observe elongated runtimes as but as long as GS500LIZ
travels through between 5500-6500 datapoints, the re-
sults are very consistent and comparable. I hope this
helps. Juha-Pekka V¨ ah¨ a

I’m using Abi310 almost on my own and many times
have similar problem. I’ve checked that you can keep
the polymer for a little longer, the longest time i run
samples on the same polymer was 2 weeks and the re-
sults were still ﬁne. I also keep the buﬀer for longer,
usually about 10 days, but the guy from Applera told
me, that it’s better to be rather strict with changing
buﬀer. Could you please post me the answers you will
get, or post them on evoldir? Maybe there will be some
other interesting tips. Ola Gondek Institute of Nature

——-
If you keep the room where the sequencer is palced
airconditionned so that the temperature is below 20
degreeC, and if you just need fast short runs for se-
quencing small fragments (says, 300bp), the polymer
remains fairly good for several weeks. But, this is oﬀ-
set by a shortened life of the capillaries (due to old
polymer) to our experience.
Good luck.

POP7 lasts at least 15 days on the machine with no ill
eﬀect on band resolution or the capillary (1000+ runs).
When our 3730xl and 3130xl have low usage we 1) do
not put on a full bottle (recycle the old empty bottles)
and 2) we do a blank water run every second or third
day to keep the polymer from getting “stale” in the
capillaries.

We have used polymer that was slightly past expiration
with good results. However, every situation is diﬀerent.
Nonetheless, I would take ABI’s “no more than a week”
with a grain of salt.

We’re using a 3100 which is nearly the same as your ma-

than a week (up to 2 weeks) with no ill eﬀects. The

I’m a PhD student from Madrid. I’m working with
SNPs. There are two SNPs in contiguous or adjacent

Allelic Diversity
We are trying to model loss of genetic variation due to
drift and have a known starting genetic sample of ap-
proximately 70% of the population. Can anyone sug-
gest how we estimate the number of alleles missed in
our sampl e such that we can model an appropriate
starting allele frequency distrib ution. I see this as a
diﬀerent problem to unequal sample sizes, since w e are
not trying to compare between samples but rather pre-
dict the true a llelic richness based on our subsample
of known proportion (ie. we know h ow many animals
were not sampled).
Thanks for your advice.

SpecialEventAwards
SPECIAL EVENT AWARDS FROM THE AMERI-
CAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION
The Council of the American Genetic Association in-
vites applications from members of the Association for
support of special events that further the purposes of
the Association. The Association expects to make one
or two awards of approximately $10,00015,000. Eligi-
ble events include specialized workshops open to Asso-
ciation members in areas of great current interest and
short courses in organismal genetics, but any event that
would advance the purpose of the Association is eligible
for support. We encourage members to think creatively
about the types of events they could oﬀer with support
from the Association and to propose topic areas that
have not been previously covered.
An application for a Special Event Award should in-
clude the following items of information: 1. The
name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) who will be
responsible for organizing the event and overseeing the
expenditure of any funds awarded. 2. The institu-
tion to which an award should be made, including the
complete address of the relevant institutional depart-
ment and the signature of an authorized institutional
representative indicating the institutions willingness to
administer the award if granted. 3. The title of the
event for which an award is requested. 4. A rationale
for the event explaining (a) why the event is timely
or needed, (b) how the planned event will address the
perceived need, and (c) how support from the Amer-
ican Genetic Association will improve the event, e.g.,
by making it possible or by making it more aﬀordable
for graduate students and post-doctoral research asso-
ciates. The rationale need not be longer than 1 page. 5.
A description of the event including: a list of primary
participants (e.g., workshop leaders, course instructors,
keynote speakers), dates and location of the event, a
preliminary schedule for the event, and a plan for how
participants will be selected (if participation is limited).
The description need not be longer than 2 pages. 6. A
budget for the event showing how funds provided by an
award from the Society would be used to support event
activities. If funds are also being sought from other
sources, the budget should show both how funds from
the Association will be used and how funds from other44 EvolDir May 1, 2006
sources will be used. (The sources of other funds need
not be identiﬁed, but the application should indicate
whether the funds are in hand.)
Applications for a Special Event Award should be sent
electronically as Word or pdf attachments to the As-
sociation oﬃce (agajoh@ncifcrf.gov). The Council will
review all applications received before May 15, 2006
and will decide on an award at its annual meeting in
July 2006.
If you have questions about the award, please contact
me (ashley@uic.edu).

Collagenase Extractions
Dear EvolDir,
I wish to try out the method described in Eguchi &
Eguchi (High yield DNA extraction from the snake cast-
oﬀ skin or bird feathers using collagenase; Biotechnol-
ogy Letters 22: 1097-1100, 2000). There is a pre-DNA
extraction step where collagenase is used to disperse
cells, followed by the typical lysis buﬀer and protease
K digestion step.
Unfortunately the original authors did not specify a
catalog number for a collagenase they used, and can-
not be contacted. I wish to hear from anyone who
has either used this method or has used collagenase
for cell dispersion (in vitro, using preserved tissues).
I have obtained some collagenase from the same com-
pany (although they have a great number of varieties,
and mine is quite possibly diﬀerent from that of the
original study), but there are no instructions for its
use. I read somewhere that calcium might be a co-
factor needed for some collagenases to work, but does
anyone have a rough protocol for a buﬀer to use with it
or any suggestions? As the cell solution would then be
used for DNA extraction, are there buﬀers or reagents
to avoid? Does anyone know the best way of diluting
the powdered form of collagenase (e.g. is ddH20 enough
or should it be diluted in a buﬀer with Ca ions or some
other buﬀer)?
Thank you for your assistance! Kind regards, Gabriela

Data Analysis Challenges Arising from the DNA Bar-
code Initiative
The Challenge: The Data Analysis Working Group
(DAWG) of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life
(CBOL) has developed interdisciplinary research chal-
lenge problems in statistics and computer science aris-
ing from DNA barcoding, a method proposed as a tool
for diﬀerentiating species. Students, postdocs, and re-
searchers from all over the world are challenged to de-
velop new approaches to these problems. Compelling
solutions to these challenges will require collaboration
among taxonomists, population geneticists, and evolu-
tionary and systematic biologists, so DAWG encourages
the formation of multidisciplinary teams.
Presenting Preliminary Ideas at a Workshop in Paris:
Preliminary ideas for approaches to these problems
will be discussed at a workshop at the National
Museum of Natural History in Paris on 6-8 July
2006 (see http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/-

registration when all spaces are ﬁlled.
Travel awards for a limited number of Europeans who
would like to give presentions at this workshop will be
available through funding from the Conservation Ge-
netics Programme of the European Science Foundation.
Travel awards for US presenters will also be available,
pending funding agency approval. Travel support will
focus primarily on increasing the participation of stu-
dents, postdocs and junior faculty.
Presenting More Advanced Results at a Conference in
Southeast Asia: The preliminary workshop will be fol-
lowed by an international conference in southeast Asia
in February 2007, during which the most promising ap-
proaches to these challenge problems will be presented.

Dibrachys wasp samples
Dear EvolDir users,
I am a PhD student at Hamburg University (Zoological
Museum) and I am working on the biology and ecol-
ogy of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae).
For taxonomic and systematic studies I am looking for
EtOH material of the species in the genus Dibrachys.
Maybe there is somebody out there, who is collecting
these small wasps or maybe even gets them as a sort of
“waste product” in studies on the host species. I am
also interested in (undetermined) material from some
Diptera host species (not necessarily in EtOH) Earwig
parasitoids Tachinidae: Triarthria spp. and Ocytata
pallipes Bird blowﬂies: Calliphoridae: Protocalliphora
spp.
If you can provide some material, please contact me.

Freezing ABI sequencer polymer
Dear All,
I would like to have you advice please.
We recently ordered some polymer from ABI for ABI
sequencer. The polymer arrived frozen yesterday. I
remembered that polymer cannot be frozen or it will
aﬀect the sequencing quality. But the ABI reps said
that it won’t and they usually do like this.
Has anyone got similar experience before? Or known if
freezing will have a bad eﬀect on the separation quality?
Thank you very much.

GeoDis problems
I am working on my thesis using GeoDis 2.4 looking

Clade 1-1 2 II III 1 0 1 1 1 1
Error message reads : the number of haplotypes for
location X can not be one-you need genetic variation
for this analysis. I do believe that II and III of line 3
represents 2 haplotypes! I’ve tried entering 2 i.e. 2 hap-
lotypes at location 1-same thing (2 was entered for line
7) Also just entering 1 under location 1 just to see-same
thing Another example
Clade 3-3 2 2-5 2-2 1 0 2 2 5 1 0 0 1
The program error is the same-it ﬂags location 2 as be-48 EvolDir May 1, 2006
ing problematic and not 5. The same thing happens
in another ﬁle and the clade is ﬂanked before and after
with clades that have the exact same scenario (clade

Heterozygosity Excess Answers
Hi EvolDir members, thank you very much for your an-
swers. Since several colleagues have the same problem
as me. Below I attached all of the reply on my question.
My original message: Hi all, Does anyone help me to
clear the diﬀerence between concepts of heterozygote
excess in HWE and heterozygosity excess in BOTTLE-
NECK tests? I found in my results that most popula-
tions shown heterozygosity excess in BOTTLENECK
test, but diﬁcit of heterozygotes in HWE test. I would

Kang Ming
Hi,
In HWE tests, heterozygosity excess/deﬁcit refer to
the excess/deﬁcit of the observed heterozygosity (theproportion of heterozygotes in a population of a
diploid organism) relative to the expected heterezy-
gosity under HW, i.e. the “gene diversity” (He= 1-
sum[allele freq ^2]). In Bottelneck tests, heterozygosity
excess/deﬁcit refer to the excess/deﬁcit of gene diver-
sity (He) relative to a model predicting He from the
number of alleles observed in a sample of a demograph-
ically stable population at drift-mutation equilibrium.
The terminology “heterozygosity excess” for Bottleneck
tests is indeed confusing because it is unrelated to the
proportion of heterozygote individuals. The origin of
the confusion stems from the widespread but unfortu-
nate use of “heterozygosity” to denote He in population
genetics litterature, which is meaningful only for diploid
populations at HWE.
Best regards,
Olivier Hardy
Dear Kang,
heterozygote excess and heterozygosity excess are dif-
ferent and independent issues. The former is simply
the excess of heterozygote individuals with respect to
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The latter is a lit-
tle more complicated concept: A bottlenecked popu-
lation will transitorily show an excess of heterozygos-
ity over that expected under the mutation-drift equi-
librium. The test relies on the assumption of allele
neutrality and mutation-drift equilibrium. It is based
on the principle that near the mutation-drift equilib-
rium the expected heterozygosity equals the measured
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium heterozygosity in nonbot-
tlenecked populations. Instead, if a population has
been subjected to a recent bottleneck, the mutation-
drift equilibrium is temporarily disrupted and the ex-
pected heterozygosity will be signiﬁcantly greater than
the HWE-heterozygosity calculated from the number
of alleles sampled. The test allows the detection of the
heterozygosity excess due to the faster loss of low fre-
quency alleles and thus determines if a population has
been recently bottlenecked. In fact, the loss of low fre-
quency alleles does not account for an equal loss in het-
erozygosity. I used the test in MALTAGLIATI F. 2002.

Hi,
Very easy :May 1, 2006 EvolDir 49
HWE tests for departure from the distribution of geno-
type frequencies expected under random mating, using
the actual gene frequencies. Heterozygote deﬁcits indi-
cate some degree of inbreeding, due to selﬁng or, e.g., a
Wahlund eﬀect (structured population). Heterozygote
excess are rarer, and usually involve diﬀerent gene fre-
quencies between males and females gametes. Of course
selection at particular loci can also be involved, but
then there are large heterogeneities of patterns among
loci.
BOTTLENECK tests for past demographic bottleneck.
When a population goes through a bottleneck, random
dift is stronger so that gene frequencies are rapidly
changed. Rare alleles are lost ﬁrst, whereas the loss
of heterozygotes (due to the loss of polymorphism) is
occuring at a slower pace (but with no departure from
HWE if indeed random mating is occuring). There are
theoretical expectations with regards to the frequency
of heterozygotes and number of alleles at mutation -
drift equilibrium in a population of constant size. So
one way to suggest a recent bottleneck is to compare
the level of polymorphism (as shown by heterozygote
frequency) with the number of alleles. If there are too
many heterozygotes compared to the number of alleles
(heterozygote excess) this means you have too few rare
alleles, and then you can suspect a recent bottleneck. If
on the contrary there are few heterozygotes compared
to the number of alleles (so too many rare alleles), you
can suspect a recent expansion of the population.
In your case it looks like your population went through
a recent bottleneck, and there is departure from random
mating (selﬁng or mating preferentially with neighbours
for instance).
I hope this helps Best, Isabelle

dom mating) you expect H=2pq, and the Fis is mea-

ID in CanadaDear Colleagues,
I am distressed to bring to your attention an alarm-
ing decision made by the Canadian Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) concerning the
relative scientiﬁc merit of evolutionary biology vs. in-
telligent design. Dr. Brian Alters, Director of the Evo-
lution Education Research Centre at McGill Univer-
sity recently submitted a grant to the council entitled
Detrimental eﬀects of popularizing anti-evolutions in-
telligent design theory on Canadian students, teachers,
parents, administrators, and policymakers. As the title
implies, this proposal aimed to investigate how the in-
creasing popularity and expose of intelligent design in
the United States is aﬀecting acceptance of evolution-
ary biology in Canada. Dr. Alters is well respected and
has a distinguished record in this area of study, includ-
ing being an expert witness at the Kitzmiller v. Dover
Area School Board court battle over I.D. Dr. Alters
grant proposal ended up being rejected by the review
committee. The committees comments are presented
below in their entirety:
The committee found that the candidates were qual-
iﬁed. However, it judged the proposal did not ade-
quately substantiate the premise that the populariza-
tion of Intelligent Design Theory had detrimental ef-
fects on Canadian students, teachers, parents and pol-
icy makers. Nor did the committee consider that there
was adequate justiﬁcation for the assumption in the
proposal that the theory of Evolution, and not Intelli-
gent Design theory, was correct. It was not convinced,
therefore, that research based on these assumptions
would yield objective results. In addition, the com-
mittee found that the research plans were insuﬃciently
elaborated to allow for an informed evaluation of their
merit. In view of its reservations the committee recom-
mended that no award be made.
I dont believe that I am appropriately qualiﬁed to eval-
uate Dr. Alters proposal, but I believe we can all evalu-
ate the comments made by the SSHRC evaluation com-
mittee. The statement, Nor did the committee consider
that there was adequate justiﬁcation for the assumption
in the proposal that the theory of Evolution, and not
Intelligent Design theory, was correct should set of seri-
ous alarm bells. SSHRC is one of three major granting
agencies in Canada. There is clearly a problem when a
major federal granting agency demands that scientists
prove the validity of evolution as part of their proposals.
I have attached the summary statement from Dr. Al-
ters proposal below (with permission). If you are
so inspired you can contact the president of SSHRC
(stan.shapson@sshrc.ca).
Dr. Alters has asked that he be ccd on emails50 EvolDir May 1, 2006
(b.alters@mcgill.ca) when messages are sent on his be-
half to SSHRC.

Detrimental Eﬀects of Popularizing Anti-Evolutions
“Intelligent Design Theory” on Canadian Students,
Teachers, Parents, Administrators, and Policymakers
1) Summary of Proposed Research Never in recent
decades has the cornerstone of modern biology edu-
cation – evolution – been so challenged and misrep-
resented by an idea masquerading as science, and never
has that pseudoscience obtained such ubiquitous cov-
erage and resultant popularity. The new form of cre-
ationism is termed “Intelligent Design” and it seriously
threatens to aﬀect evolution education in science class-
rooms throughout North America. Intelligent Design
has been reported and discussed as never before in every
major Canadian and U.S. television, print, and radio
outlet. Proponents of Intelligent Design have facilitated
public events throughout Canada and U.S. including
speaking engagements at educational institutions such
as major universities. At the time of this writing (Oc-
tober, 2005) a high-proﬁle U.S. Federal Court case is
examining the constitutionality (church/state separa-
tion) of teaching Intelligent Design in public school sci-
ence classrooms, which was reported in virtually every
major media outlet worldwide. The President of the
United States publicly supported teaching Intelligent
Design in schools. Despite this far-reaching populariza-
tion of Intelligent Design, and the political and religious
movements to legitimize it as a science to be taught in
schools, every leading scientiﬁc organization in North
America has resoundingly rejected Intelligent Design as
science and strongly recommends that it not be taught
as science in science classrooms. Moreover, every lead-
ing science education association has come out against
teaching Intelligent Design in science courses. Unfortu-
nately, the result of such consistent and massive media

This paper recent paper on the use of 100% propylene
glycol for preservation of spiders for later DNA extrac-
tion is exciting because propylene glycol is non-toxic
(it’s a food additive) and thus can be safely mailed and
carried on planes etc. It eﬀectively dehydrates the tis-
sues.
The eﬀects of preservatives and temperatures on arach-
nid DNA Author(s): Vink CJ, Thomas SM, Paquin P,
Hayashi CY, Hedin M Source: INVERTEBRATE SYS-
TEMATICS 19 (2): 99-104 2005
I’d like to know if anyone has additional experience with
this method of preservation. The authors used spiders
so one might assume the method would work for all
arthropods - has anyone used it with insects?
I wonder speciﬁcally if larger bodied insects might not
preserve as well in PG as in ethanol if the ethanol pen-
etrates the tissues to dehydrate them faster than PG.
I’d also like to know if propylene glycol is a viable long-
term alternative to high-grade ethanol for specimens
stored at -80C.
Finally, I’m curious if there are any issues with DNA ex-
traction - does the PG need to be thoroughly removed
from the specimen for successful extraction? and if so,
how is this done?
I’ll collect replies oﬀ-list and summarize them for a later
posting.
Thanks!

Micro stutter answers
Thank you to everyone who replied! I was able to
reduce the ambiguity in identiﬁying the ’true’ alleles
by implementing suggestions for PCR optimization. In
particular, reducing the number of cycles and the time
at each step, resulted in PCR products in which the
stutter was reduced. Previously, each allele at a het-
erozygous individual, had exhibited several peaks of
very similar size. After reducing the number of cycles
and the time at each step, each allele had one larger
peak with several smaller stutter peaks in front of it.
There were numerous requests to post the replies so
here they are:
Here is a repeat of a post Brian made some years
ago compiling responses to a similar question. Hope
it helps. RESPONSES TO MICROSAT STUTTERS
Below I have grouped the responses so far received to
reduce stutters, thank you to everyone who has re-
sponded! The most common response was to reduce the
number of cycles. Followed by reduce the MgCl concen-
tration. Also a mix of PCR cycle options with a high
initial annealing temperature either through a ’Touch
down’ process or a few said plain heating your PCR
before you put the polymerase in. ’Two-step’ PCR
was mentioned more than just heating your reaction
without taq. Also as popular was to reduce the exten-
sion time at the end. About 3-4 people said speciﬁcally
to try hot start taq. After the combined PCR sug-
gestions commonly stated was to just redesign reverse
primers according to the ’Pig-tail’ method (Brownstein
et al. 1996, Biotechniques 20, 1004-1010). Since then I
have reduced the number of cycles, then also shortened
the extension time. Then with the shortened number
of cycles and extension time varied MgCl from 1.5 to
2.5 because the person who uses them successfully now
says not to go out of this range. I have also kept the
2.5 MgCl as original, but added BSA. I am currently
looking over the results, but wanted to pass along the
feedback I have been getting. Again THANK YOU
very much to all who responded. PCR REACTION
CHANGES . Varying Mg++ levels, maybe try a gradi-
ent from 1-4mM, lower MgCl helps to reduce stutters.
. Use hot start Taq . Change concentration of your
primers. We use a starting concentration of only 0.5uM
of our labeled primer and then the reverse (unlabeled) is
2uM. My labmates have found that better bands some-
times come with changing the labeled primer to either0.3uM or 0.7uM. We were told that it’s good to have
the reverse primer in higher concentration. . Try out
t4 polymerase PCR CYCLE CHANGES . Reduce the
number of cycles down as low as possible, 40 cycles is
excessive and try 25 cycles o “increasing the number
of cycles may increase nonspeciﬁc background and may
lead to artifacts” (source: Qiagen multiplex pcr hand-
book, 2002, p.33) . Use a very stringent annealing temp
. Set your ﬁnal extension to 70 degrees or 65 degrees
for 45 mins (see Proﬁler Plus manual for Proﬁler Plus
kit used on humans). I had some loci which were tricky
to score until our lab stumbled across the reaction con-
ditions used for Proﬁler Plus kit. . ’Touch down’ PCR
program o start Tm at 65C or 67C and the anneal-
ing temp reduced 2C per cycle for the next cycles up
to TmX, then the remaining cycles at a 58C annealing
temperature o start at 60C and within the ﬁrst 10 cy-
cles down the Ta to 50C, then keep 50C for the next
30 cycles o start at 60C and within the ﬁrst 10 cycles
down the Ta to 50C, then keep 50C for the next 30
cycles . “short PCR” o cycles of 15s at 94, 15s at an-
nealing temperature and 45s at 72 and lower the num-
ber of cycles. I’ve heard people sometimes run only 5s
at annealing temperature . Hotstart PCR with regular
promega taq by performing a ﬁrst denaturing step with
DNA, primers and water and then lower the tempera-
ture for about 85C to add the master mix containing
taq and all the other reagents. I’ve performed 12.5 ul
reactions, primer concentrations ranging from as low as
0.03 to 1.2uM in multiplexes. Annealing temperatures
were 58C for most primer sets and 60C. I also recom-
mend the Quiagen multiplex PCR mix, that provides
a taq appropriate for hotstart PCR. . No 72C exten-
sion step in the cycle (I mean that I have the annealing
step followed by the denaturing step and then anneal-
ing again, with the Taq extending during the ramp, for
microsats is more then necessary), and only 2 minutes
of ﬁnal extension step. . Biotechniques suggested “ab-
breviated cycling times” for PCR steps. For instance,
denature for only 2 seconds, anneal for 2 seconds, ex-
tend for 8 seconds. I’ve often used this “2/2/8” protocol
(or some variant, e.g. 3/3/12) to clean up microsatellite
stutter. Sometimes it fails miserably, but in about 50%
of the cases it helps dramatically. . Try heating your
PCR without taq in it for 15min @95C,then adding taq
. Two-step PCR o 30sec at 94C and 80 sec at 50C. Also
here is the reference that uses the suggested cycle Here

PAUP memory issue
Hello EVOLDIR members, I am running a bootstrap
with PAUP on a MAC, but the machine keeps run-
ning out of memory and needs to be prompted to con-
tinue after one replicate or so. The bootstrap is very
straightforward-no branch bindings, constraints or any-
thing fancy-just 100 replicates/10 random additions
with unweighted characters basically. Max trees are
set to automatically increase by 100. The OSX is the
issue, I just don’t know how to allocate more memory
to keep the thing up and running. Any ideas? Austin

PAUP on MacIntosh Computers
Dear EvolDir members,
I have just purchased a new macintosh computer. One
of the objectives was to run PAUP on it. Unfortunately,
I realize now that it is not possible to run Paup, because
the new Intel-based Mac’s do not support the ’classic’
environment (OS 9) necessary to run the current ver-
sion of Paup. In the Paup website, they say that the
next version will include a command-line version for
Mac OSX, but this announcement was made in 2002
already. Since Macintosh has announced that all their
computers will have these Intel-processors from the end
of this year onward, very soon no new computer will be
able to run Paup.
I would like to ask if there is some alternative, whether
to hope that a new version will be made available that
works with OS X, or some workaround maybe compil-
ing the source code to work on OS X. Any suggestion
would be helpful.
Thank you for your help!

PAUP on Macs answers
Dear All,
Thank you very much for all your replies. I had a
mixed-feeling from the responses. Some were rather
pessimistic about the future use of PAUP with MAC’s,
while others suggested some interesting workarounds.
Some good news is that David Swoﬀord, has announced
a new version of PAUP for this year as mentioned in the
PAUP help group( http://lists.scs.fsu.edu/pipermail/-
pauphelp/2006-March/000220.html ) This version issupposed to run natively in Mac OSx. If you are too
anxious to wait for the next version, there are two other
options: 1. You can use the command-line version for
UNIX http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/versions.html in MAC
OSX even if you-re using the new Intel processors, by
accessing the UNIX terminal in Mac OSX (don’t ask
me how to do it, though!) 2. You can use an emulator
called SheepShaver ( http://www.gibix.net/dokuwiki/-
en:projects:sheepshaver)that can run OS9 applications
in OSx. This seems like a good option, but it might
slow down your machine. I’ll have to try this one.
If you are a windows user, there is also some
good news: Of course you can run either the
command-line version for either Windows or Dos.
If you have the latter version, you can also use
the PAUP-up GUI ( http://www.agro-montpellier.fr/-
sppe/Recherche/JFM/PaupUp/main.htm ) that will al-
low you to access most of the same menus as in the Mac
version.
Of course, there are other programs that can replace
PAUP, like Phylip, PhyML, etc.
Some people also mentioned Boot-camp ( http://-
www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/ ). This is a pro-
gram that allows you to boot your Intel- based Mac
in Windows XP, but this would only allow to run Win-
dows programs in Mac computers, which is exciting by
itself, but another issue altogether.
I hope this helps other people too! I will try some of
these alternatives myself in the near-future.

Population tree help
Dear members,
I have a data of mtDNA sequences from 9 populations
of the same species, each population diﬀers in size and
the minimum population size is 20. I would like to draw
a nj tree of the population data with bootstraping. I
can draw individual tree using PAUP but i could not
conﬁgure how to draw population tree by PAUP. I de-
ﬁned 9 taxa after the sequence data of all individuals in
the input ﬁle, but it didnot take this into consideration.
When i use the genetic distance matrix (estimated us-
ing Arlequin) in PHYLIP, I can have the population
tree but this time with no bootstrapping. When I en-
ter the sequence data into Phylip, it again constructs
the individuals tree, and there is no way to deﬁne the
populations (that I know of).
I would really appreciate your help. I am looking for-
ward to hear from you soon.

QuestionI’m looking for software you can use to download spe-
ciﬁc SNPs from GENBANK together with speciﬁed
ﬂanking sequences and information about other SNPs
in that ﬂanking sequence. I know the software SN-
Phunter ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ppg/software )
does precisely this, but I am looking for a program in
which you can do batch queries for speciﬁc SNPs us-
ing a ﬁle that lists SNPs according to their rs numbers.
The batch queries of SNPhunter only involve genes, as
far as I know, and my SNPs are not associated with
genes.
Answer
I did not get any replies but found something that works
for me on the net @ http://snpper.chip.org/ You can
specify the snps that you want in a batch list, and then
get the SNPs with speciﬁed lengths of ﬂanking frag-
ments and other snps in the ﬂanking parts in an output
ﬁle.
You have to register to use the webpage.
Apparently SNPhunter can also handle SNP batch
queries with rs numbers, haven’t tried it though

SeparatingDNA answers
Dear evoldir members,
Thank you all for your suggestions on how to solve my
problem. Most people so far have advised me to design
internal primers to amplify fragments of 150 to 300 bp,
and then assemble them to get the full gene. I also
got some references to columns that allow one to re-
move smaller ( <200 bp or so) fragments from DNA
extracts.
Below i post the replies i got so far (in order of arrival).
I think i got them all, but if i forgot some answer please
let me know. Also I have ommited the email addresses
(I think there is such a thing as email harvesters out
there in the internet) so if you need to reply to someone,
let me know and I will send you the emails.
For now it seems like my extracts contain some inhibit-
ing substance, but that it is possible to remove it using
the Qiaquick spin columns. I did a couple of “spik-
ing” PCRs. This is when you add to a PCR two dif-
ferent DNA extracts, one from one sample that you
know that works and another from a sample that is not
working. In the ﬁrst such PCR, the ampliﬁcation did
not occur, meaning that the extract that doesn’t work
probably contains inhibitors. After running these ex-
tracts through Qiaquick columns I did a new “spiking”
PCR, and now it works, which probably means that I
no longer have inhibitors in my non-working extract.
I also tried a PCR on the extracts that I run through
Qiaquick, but no ampliﬁcation occurred. Thus it now
seems that the problem is fragmentation of my DNAand I will try to design primers to amplify shorter frag-
ments.
Once again thank you all for your help
Best wishes to all of you,
cheers

Hi Bruno,
You may not be able to see your fragments on a gel (I
suppose you’re talking about 2-3% low-melting agarose
gel), if the DNA is degraded. It is easier to design
primers for shorter target fragments (100-400bp each),
than to try to ﬁsh out longer fragments, if any are still
there - again, not very likely, if the DNA is degraded.
Once you ampliﬁed the short amplicons, build a contig
and you will be able to assemble your target sequence
of 900bp.
Cheers, sergios

Well, your problem looks rather strange. To have a
good quality of extraction of your samples you must
ﬁrst be sure that the hole ethanol has evaporated be-
fore beginning. What I usually do is to cut the samples
in little pieces, absorbe the ethanol on a paper, and af-
ter dry them in an autoclave (the time depend on your
samples) and after it works ﬁne. You also have to in-
crease the quantity of proteinase to digest (2-3) times,
and wait that the digestion is complete (shake gently
in the autoclave). After you should maybe cheek if you
have pcr inhibitors in your extract. Use the DNA and
Primers of someone for how it works and add in the
pcr the same amount of your sample. Make a positive
control. After, try also to be sure that your primers
works, what I suppose it’s more the problem. Maybe
you can try to amplify another fragment that is more
conserved just to cheek if you have your mtDNA. Short
fragment of dna to my knowledge don’t inhibate the
pcr, it’s more enzymes and ions. You can also try in
diluting your dna (sometimes it solve the problems of
inhibitors). If you can, try to quantify the DNA you
have in your extract.

500bp may still be too long–I had good luck with 200-
300bp in the control region with degraded DNA. Good
luck! – Rachel E. Simmons

Hi, Bruno, I guess, your target size is still too big...fromMay 1, 2006 EvolDir 57
my experience, up to 300 bp usually work ﬁne in older
samples. If your could design internal primers (from
fresh sample sequences), it might work.

Hi Bruno Several things. Firstly I would be surprised
if the number of small frags alone was the problem, but
here are some things you can try.
1) Put the extract through a silica based PCR col-
umn, like Qiagen’s Qiaquick. Stuﬀ under 70bp (which
as DNA degrades in a weird exponential like fashion
will probably be the majority of fragments) will wash
through, leaving you the larger fragments at the end.
2) If you wan’t to try and get rid of stuﬀ from a larger
cutoﬀ, you can try Biorad’s PCR Kleen Spin columns.
They work on a diﬀerent techology and remove stuﬀ
<200bp.
The problem with the above is that you lost some of
your large DNA too. Maybe you will get 80% back of
what you put in. But it may help. However, I am not
sure that inhibition from DNA frags is your problem.
So, some more things.
Maybe your size of assay is too big. DNA really de-
grades fast. I would suggest that you start aiming for
something small, like a 100bp fragment of the D-loop.
If it works then you can increase the size. There is
pretty good evidence that as you reduce size of frag-
ment, you get an exponential increase in numbers of
template molecules. So small is good.

Dear EvolDir readers,
I’m looking for live laboratory cultures or ethanol-
preserved samples of the following Tenebrionidae bee-
tles:
- Tribolium anaphe, T. destructor, T. audax, or
other less cosmopolitan Tribolium from South Amer-
ica, Madagascar, Australia or New Zeeland - Latheti-
cus prosopis (’long-headed ﬂour beetle’) - Erelus ssp. -
Lyphia ssp. - Tenebrio ssp. (other than T. molitor) -
Palorus ssp. (P. ratzeburgi is of particular interest) -
Gnathocerus maxillosus
In general, if you ﬁnd a tenebrionid in ﬂour (or a simi-
lar dry stored foodstuﬀ) it is likely to be of interest to
me.
I am studying the development of the antennae in Tri-
bolium, and the evolutionary context of antennal diver-
sity in this genus. Live laboratory cultures are particu-
larly useful for comparative developmental work, how-
ever samples from any of these species would be very
useful for systematics.
Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated!

POSTDOC POSITION in Evo-Devo
in Banyuls sur Mer, France ( http://-
www.k-projects.com/cnrs postdocs/public/-
departement details.php?IdDpt&Dep=-
SDV&NumOﬀre1&Langue=en )
A postdoctoral position is available in September 2006
on the following subject: “Evolution of the embryonic
axis in chordates: Role of the FGF signaling pathway
in the embryonic development of the cephalochordate
amphioxus.”
The present project aims to understand the functional
relationships between two signalling pathways impli-
cated in the control of the axial patterning in chor-
dates. These signalling pathways are the retinoic acid
(RA) one and the FGF (Fibroblast growth factor) one.
We will study the role of FGF genes and the possible
crosstalk between the FGF and RA signalling pathways
in the antero-posterior patterning developmental pro-
cess. Taking advantage of the common evolutionary
origin of all chordates, we have chosen a comparative
approach (Evo-Devo). We will use the cephalochordate
amphioxus as an animal model and we will try to under-
stand how the vertebrate-speciﬁc genome duplications
that generated 22 FGF genes in humans, instead of 8 in
amphioxus, have contributed to the evolution of com-
plexity and to the diversiﬁcation and of the vertebrate
phylum.
Applicants for this postdoctoral research project should
be interested in research in the Evo-Devo ﬁeld and
should be capable to manage his own work. Applicants
should have a background in developmental biology and
evolution and should also know the most common tech-
niques in molecular biology, developmental biology and
some basic bioinformatics. Some experience in the use
of the amphioxus animal model will be also much ap-
preciated.

Centre d’Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive - CNRS
Exploring inter-plant carbon transfers mediated by my-
corrhizal fungi in orchids
Fields of interest of our team: we focus on plant-to-
plant interactions mediated by mycorrhizal fungi in
temperate ecosystems. Among other aspects, we are
interested in plants that rely on the carbon provided
by mycorrhizal fungi shared with other plants - the lat-
ter being the ultimate carbon source. This situation
is allowed by the low speciﬁcity of mycorrhizal interac-
tions, which entail sharing of fungal symbionts by plants
of diﬀerent species, i.e. the formation of a mycorrhizal
network linking several plants of a given community.
Fungal carbon is a partial C source for some plants
(mixotrophy, where photosynthesis still contributes to
the plant’s carbon budget) or can be the exclusive
source of C for others (achlorophyllous plants called my-
coheterotrophs’). Our work so far has focused on (1) de-
scribing mycorrhizal fungal partners of various plants,
to demonstrate such networks and (2) establishing in-
directly (by methods based on stable isotopes of C and
gas exchange) that mixotrophic or mycoheterotrophic
plants exist. Our main models are orchids from a tem-
perate forest tribe, the Neottieae, but we are now turn-
ing to other plant species. See publications at http:/-
/www.cefe.cnrs.fr/coev/MA Selosse.html . Working
project in which the associated researcher would be in-
volved: Little is known on (1) the impact of of mixotro-
phy or mycoheterotrophy on the ﬁtness of the fungal
and plant partners and (2) how these ±heterotrophic
plants recover the carbon from their mycorrhizal fun-
gus. By using orchids or other models studied by our
team, we aim at accomplish the following:
(1) Conduct in situ labelling experiments to track car-
bon ﬂows;
(2) Establish of carbon budgets for mixotrophic species
in situ;May 1, 2006 EvolDir 61
(3) In microcosms, develop experimental designs allow-
ing (2a) analysis of parameters related to ﬁtness of the
various partners and (2b) assessment of the biochem-
istry of the exchanges by way of labelling experiments
on ﬁner time-scales.
In this two-year project, we will collaborate with other
teams more experienced in plant C metabolism (C.
Damesin, Laboratoire d’Ecologie Syst´ ematique et Evo-
lution, Univ. Paris-Sud, France) and/or microcosm ex-
periments on mycoheterotrophic plants (D. J. Read,
Univ. Sheﬃeld, UK). We have 3-years of ﬁnancial
support from the CNRS (ATIP The functional and
evolutionary ecology of mycorrhizal networks: using
“cheaters” to explore inter-plant carbon transfers and
stability of plant-fungus interactions’ to M.-A.S) and a
grant of the French Orchid Society (SFO).
Our team is part of larger a team focusing on co-
evolution in several models, including orchids or ﬁgs
and their pollinators; domesticated plants and man; or
ants and plants. We are part of the Centre d’Ecologie
Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (ca 150 researchers on ecol-
ogy and evolution). We are located in Montpellier, near
the Mediterranean Sea, in a scientiﬁcally rich environ-
ment both for plant sciences and for evolutionary ecol-
ogy.
Requested experience: applicants should not have the
French nationality. They should be experienced (as
demonstrated by published papers) in at least three of
the following domains:
1 - Microcosm (gnotobiotic) experiments manipulating
plants and micro- organisms
2 - Physiology of nutrient transfers between symbiotic
partners
3 - Mycorrhizal fungi of orchids and/or ectomycorrhizal
plants
4 - In situ use of isotopic labelling in plant metabolism
5 - In situ use of methods to assess gas exchange in
plants and C metabolism/budget
6 - In vitro fungal culture
7 - Transmission electron microscopy
Duration: 2 years, starting in October 2006. Salary
ranges from 2 020 euro/month to 2 762 euro/month

The major goals of this NIH-funded project are to iden-
tify networks of genes aﬀecting Drosophila aggressive
behavior; the subset of genes responsible for naturally
occurring variation in aggression; and to determine how
interactions between genetic networks and environmen-
tal factors shape the expression of aggressive behav-
ior. The project will involve a forward genetic screen
to identify new candidate genes aﬀecting aggressive be-
havior and determine their interactions; whole genome
transcriptional proﬁling of mutant alleles to identify co-
regulated genetic networks aﬀecting aggression; map-
ping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) aﬀecting naturally
occurring variation in aggressive behavior with high res-
olution; and using linkage disequilibrium mapping to
identify molecular polymorphisms that are associated
with naturally occurring genetic variation in aggressive
behavior.
Candidates will be required to have a PhD in Ge-62 EvolDir May 1, 2006
netics, Biology or related ﬁeld. The ideal candi-
date will be creative, have excellent molecular biol-
ogy and statistical skills, a background in population
and/or quantitative genetics, and experience working
with Drosophila. The salary is in accordance with NIH

URennes CanopyArthropods
Dear all
— Sorry for cross-posting —
The below position is re-posted due to recent with-
drawal of a candidate. Please apply as soon as possible,
*review of applications starts immediately*. Thank
you.
—————-
Postdoc in Canopy Arthropod Ecology for 3 years avail-
able at University of Rennes 1, France (highly qualiﬁed
MScs are invited to send a statement of interest).
Arthropods in the canopy represent one of the highly
diverse, most widespread, and least studied communi-
ties in temperate regions. In the present project we will
study the role of atmospheric stress (desiccation, NH3
imissions) and island biogeographic processes (coloniza-
tion,, extinction) on arthropod biodiversity. We thus
envision the canopy as an archipelago of tree crown is-
lands in a sea or air. We will study diversity at species
level, but also at a historical, i.e. phylogenetic level. We
will also explore consequences of the diversity of arthro-
pods for their functional role, particularly as grazers
and dispersers of cryptogams. Approaches include de-
tailed observational studies, as well as transplant and
exclusion experiments with arthropod communities in
cryptogams. Canopy access will be ensured ﬂexibly byMay 1, 2006 EvolDir 67
cherry pickers and climbers. Up to date spatial sta-
tistical procedures will be applied. The external and
internal collaboration may permit possible additional
sideline studies on geno- or phenotypic diﬀerentiation of
populations, tritrophic interactions, arthropod / cryp-
togam interactions, or habitat-use behavior.
The host institution is the Research Unit Ecosystems,
Biodiversity, Evolution, co-funded by University
of Rennes 1 and Centre National de la Recherche
Scientiﬁque, harboring 58 researchers and docents.
Several further research institutions in ecology
and evolutionary biology exist at Rennes. Rennes
has approximately 200 000 inhabitants and is the
capitol of the Bretagne region with exceptional
coastal and mainland landscapes, and a french-celtic
heritage ( http://www.region-bretagne.fr/CRB/-
Public/rubriques thematique/visiter labretagne/-
labretagne unereg/la bretagne enimage/ ). English
is spoken everywhere in Academia, but not necessarily
outside.
The project is for 35 months, pending approval of the
intermediate report after 1.5 years. Salary is approx-
imately 1450-1500 Euros / month net (1 Euro = 1.23
Dollars, many 2 bedroom apartments are available at
400 500 Euros / month, all inclusive), additional funds
might become available. For an entire family this salary
is at the limit, but families of foreign scientists receive
full family aids by the state (around 200 Euros per
month) and child care is extremely well organized and
cheap in France. Moreover spouses of scientists receive
a special visa and a work permit (if the scientist is mem-
ber of the European Union, a non-European spouse can
even work without further visa, permit etc.)
The candidate should ideally contribute (1) Taxo-
nomic expert knowledge on a major group of meso-
fauna (Collembola, oribat mites, Psocoptera) or of
phytophages (aphids, Heteroptera, Curculionids, Lepi-
doptera etc.). Lack in determination knowledge is how-
ever not prohibitive, as parts of the determination work
will be delegated and others can be learned. (2) A
certain robustness for ﬁeldwork, and a driving license.
Climbing capabilities would be an important plus. (3)
Methodological experience in designing both complex
observational studies, as well as ﬁeld experiments. (4)
Experience in the appropriate statistics to analyze the
results (spatially explicit, multivariate ..). (5) Experi-
ence in communicating research to the scientiﬁc public,
focusing on conceptual advance rather than accumula-
tion of details. Documented by a strong publication
list. (6) A PhD or equivalent.
Please rapidly send applications, including CV, publi-
cation list, and major publications (if available also ad-dresses of referees and statement of research interests)
by email to Andreas Prinzing (andreas.prinzing@univ-

have a basic background in population genetic data
analysis, including testing for Hardy-Weinberg propor-
tions and gametic disequilibrium. Participation will be
limited to 25 people allowing eﬃcient instruction with
hands-on computer exercises during the course. Pri-
ority will be given to persons with their own data to
analyze (for example graduate students near the end of
their degree program).
* *
*Course/Workshop Format:* For each subject, we pro-
vide 30-45 minutes of background, theory, discussion
and introduction to concepts. Immediately following,
we will conduct data analyses together for 30-45 min-
utes using relevant software programs and real data
sets. Evening hands-on computer sessions and hous-
ing together of instructors and students in the same

SUMMER SCHOOL “GENOME EVOLUTION IN
EUKARYOTES (GEE)” , 17-22 September 2006
Dear EvolDir Members,
We are please to announce the ﬁrst Summer School
“Genome Evolution in Eukaryotes (GEE)” organized
by the University of Bologna, and to be held in the
University Residential Centre of Bertinoro (Ravenna -
Italy) from 17th to 22nd of September 2006.
We are also pleased to inform you that the GEE web-
site is now on line at www.gee.unibo.it . Genomics is a
young science that moved its ﬁrst steps mostly within
medicine and diagnostics. In the last few years, how-
ever, Genomics has also gained a major role in the in-
vestigation of most of the “big questions” of Biology,
such as the enlightening of mechanisms of Life, as well
as the reconstruction of Life Evolution on Earth.
The possibility to re-analyze genomes in an evolution-
ary framework emerged only recently, together with
the increasing number of sequenced organisms. Indeed,
Genomics is now embodying the Evolutionary Biology
ideas because, without an evolutionary approach, most
of the obtained molecular data cannot be deeply under-
stood. As a matter of fact, from the linkage of these
two disciplines, a new science is now arising: the Evo-
lutionary Genomics.This School will be just within this context: the discus-
sion of clue data of Genomics in a evolutionary frame-
work will be the base of the teaching activity, and all
analyzed genomic compartments will be examined in
relation to their implication for the beginning and evo-
lution of Life on Earth.
Chosen Teachers are among the best in their relative
research ﬁelds. Moreover, Teachers come from 6 coun-
tries and 3 continents: this will give the School a strong
international connotation. We really believe that the
School represents a precious occasion for young scien-
tists to discuss and expand their skills on the above-
mentioned topics. Oﬃcial language of the School will
be English.
Registration to the Summer School is now open. This
school is reserved to Graduates, PostDocs as well as
researchers that perform biological research activity in
any Academic or Non-Academic structure around the
world. Candidates must submit their CV to Dr. Bar-
bara Mantovani (barman@alma.unibo.it) before 30th of
June 2006. A maximum of 30 applications will be ac-
cepted. Organizing Committee will give priority to stu-
dents who will better beneﬁt from the courses because
of the contiguity of their research activity.
Please be so kind to help us advertising the Course
in your Department/Structure and among your col-
leagues. In the website you can also download a pro-
gram of the School to distribute.
Best wishes,
Dr. Marco Passamonti GEE Summer School Secre-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
