EvolutionaryChange Jun5-9
In association with ETH Zurich's Center for Adaptation
to a Changing Environment (ACE), we are writing to
announce a conference on the 'Genomic basis of eco-
evolutionary change.' The conference will take place
this summer from June 5th - June 9th 2016 at the
Monte Verit a conference centre, located near Ascona in
Switzerland.
The aim of this conference is to connect burgeoning in-
formation on the genomic basis of ecologically relevant
traits to better understand and predict the dynamics of
eco-evolutionary feedbacks.
The conference will bring together speakers from around
the world to discuss recent developments in the genomics
of ecologically relevant traits, the eco-evolutionary dy-namics of species interactions and species responses to
environmental change. Through talks, break-out ses-
sions, and informal interactions, the participants will
develop a research agenda for a genomics-based, predic-
tive understanding of eco-evolutionary change.
Conrmed speakers: Fr ed eric Guillaume Andrew
Hendry Nelson Hairston Hannah Kokko Tom Mitchell-
Olds Patrik Nosil Ole Seehausen Daniel Wegmann
Yvonne Willi
As the number of participants is limited to 73 scientists,
we ask all applicants interested in the conference to send
their curriculum vitae (max. 2 pages) and a motivation
letter (max. one page) containing a description of their
specic eld of research, motivation to participate in the
conference and an abstract of a poster to be presented
at the meeting. We especially encourage early career
scientists (PhDs and Postdocs) to apply.
Please send your application, all in one PDF, by the
21st of February to monte-verita@env.ethz.ch.

Dear colleagues,
We are very pleased to announce the launch of a new
NIH/BBSRC funded Research Coordination Network
on the role of Vector Behaviour in Transmission Ecology:
VectorBiTE.
Over the next 5 years, this RCN will support annual
meetings and workshops to promote collaborative re-
search and training in order to improve our understand-
ing of how the behavioural ecology of vectors impacts
disease transmission. Additionally, a key component
of this eort will be the creation of a global database
on vector traits, population dynamics and transmission
rates. For more information on our network goals please
see: http://vectorbite.org/ Our rst meeting will take
place at in Clearwater, FL from March 23-25, 2016. Dur-
ing this rst meeting we will organize participants into
working groups and plan the online repository structure.
Please register for the RCN on the website and apply for
the meeting at http://vectorbite.org/. We plan to pro-
vide travel support for approximately 40 participants to
attend. Applications received by February 1 will receive
full consideration, although will continue to evaluate
applications on a rolling basis until all spaces have been
lled. We are pleased to begin this new adventure and
look forward to providing a new platform for interaction
in this important area.
Exciting times ahead!

MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary
Biology 12-16 June 2016 - Hameau de l'Etoile, Montpel-
lier, South of France.
Webpage: http://www.lirmm.fr/mceb2016/ Pre-
registration deadline: February 25th Notication to
applicants: March 15th Final list of attendees: April
15th
Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and con-
cepts form an essential basis for modern evolutionary
studies. The goal of the MCEB conference (at its 8th
edition) is to bring together scientists with diverse back-
grounds to present recent advances and discuss open
problems in the eld of mathematical and computa-
tional evolutionary biology. The theme of this year's
edition will be \forecasting evolution": while most anal-
yses are designed to reconstruct the past in order to
understand evolution, our modern society is in dire
need of anticipating the future using sound scientic
approaches. This is particularly true in the context of
global warming and more generally global changes. New
approaches that model future evolution are emerging,
for example to predict epidemics, evolution of cancer,
shifts in species/population distributions or species loss.
Evolutionary biology is thus widening its focus, try-
ing to predict future biological states and better dene
the range of applicability of these predictions. Making
progress in this new research area will involve cross-
disciplinary approaches, accurate statistical methods,
and powerful computational techniques. Beyond this
year's theme, general concepts, models, methods and
algorithms will be presented and discussed, just as in
the previous editions of MCEB. Keynote speakers will
introduce a eld of research and discuss their own work
in this eld. Afternoon will be for short presentations
and posters, with plenty of time for discussions and
outdoors.
Where and when: Hameau de l'Etoile, near Montpellier,February 1, 2016 EvolDir 7
in the South of France, 12-16 June 2016.
Cost: Conference fees including accommodation for four
nights, meals, coee breaks, buses, etc., will be between
300 and 550, all inclusive, and will vary depending on
the room. PhD students and postdocs will benet of
the cheapest rooms.

Itis with the popularization of molecular tools and the
disclosure ofgenome sequences that evolutionary models
have become decisive in biology,in part because this

Molecules as documents of evolutionary history: 50years after - Rosco, Brittany, France.
May 9-13 2016
It is with the popularization of molecular tools and the
disclosure of genome sequences that evolutionary models
have become decisive in biology, in part because this
information is simply so abundant and so complex that
only a comparative method could reveal its meaning.
In 2016, it will be 50 years that Emile Zuckerkandl
and Linus Pauling have laid the foundation of molec-
ular phylogeny, and molecular evolution in general, in
their seminal article entitled \Molecules as documents
of evolutionary history". The fundamental realization
of this article was that DNA does not only encode the
elementary functional elements of an organisms, it also
harbours abundant information on the evolutionary his-
tory and life history traits of its ancestors.
The modelling of the evolutionary processes that gener-
ated extent genomes should reveal together the patterns
of the diversication of life, the processes by which evo-
lution proceeds at the molecular level, and how both are
aected by external conditions. Our challenge today,
as evolutionary biologists, is to bridge the gap between
species ecology, life history traits, population dynamics,
species phylogeny, gene phylogeny, genome structure,
gene network and molecular mechanisms.
The recent years have seen tremendous developments in
this direction, which we will attempt to review in this

ACAD Adelaide AncientDNA
Aboriginal Heritage Project: Phylogeography, Genetics
and Ancient DNA
A PhD project is available at the Australian Centre for
Ancient DNA (https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/) as
part of several ongoing ARC-funded studies to recon-
struct Aboriginal Heritage using ancient DNA and mu-
seum collections of hair samples from across Australia.
The project is a close collaboration with Aboriginal fam-ilies and communities across Australia and the South
Australian Museum. It is aimed at reconstructing a
continent-wide picture of Indigenous Australia prior to
European colonisation, analysing migration and trade
routes, and the distribution of genetic diversity and
community relationships.
Relevant techniques include ancient DNA, phylogeogra-
phy, archaeology, Aboriginal culture and history, and
museum research. The project has strong potential
to make major contributions to our understanding of
Australian and Aboriginal history and assist with the
Stolen Generation and reconciliation more broadly. The
project is a close collaboration with the South Aus-
tralian Museum, BioPlatforms Australia, the Australian16 EvolDir February 1, 2016
Genome Research Facility, and an international team of
researchers. Fieldwork in remote communities will form
a key part of the project.
A highly motivated candidate with strong initiative and
organisational skills is required. The ideal applicant
will have previous experience with molecular biology
methods along with a background in areas such as ge-
netics, archaeology, ancient DNA, phylogeography or
anthropology and a strong interest in Aboriginal and
Australian history. A publication record would be a dis-
tinct advantage. The position is open to both Australian
and international candidates.
Contact Dr Ray Tobler, ray-
mond.tobler@adelaide.edu.au, with a letter of
interest and background information addressing the
above criteria. The position will remain open until

CharlesU Prague BirdAdaptation
PhD position available from October 2016 \Causes and
consequences of ecological specialization in birds"
Project background: Populations of ecological specialists
decline due to their sensitivity to global environmental
changes. Although various studies conrmed this pat-
tern, wider context of evolutionary causes and ecological
consequences of species' specialization remains unclear.
Proposed project focuses on elucidating these issues
using birds as a study system. Birds are a taxon with
detailed knowledge of ecological and life history traits,
population and range sizes, phylogenetic relationships
and extinction risk of all species. Within this project, we
will use this information to learn more about evolution-
ary conservatism of ecological specialization (whereas
avian species do not usually expand their niches after in-
troduction outside native ranges, closely related species
often show high variability in their niche breadth) and
to focus on possible changes in specialization across
species' geographic ranges, e.g. in relation to their local
densities. The applicant will also collect own eld data
to examine relationships among habitat specialization
at the individual, population and species level, respec-
tively. Finally, knowledge from the above mentioned
relationships will be applied in the analysis predictingFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 17
global extinction risk of particular species by dierent
facets of their specialization.
Eligibility: We expect a motivated student with good
experience in ornithology, able (after some training) to
work independently in the eld in Eastern Europe. The
ideal candidate for this PhD position is interested in
ecology and evolutionary biology, and is willing to learn
new methods. He/she must have nished the MSc. (or
equivalent) by September 2016 at the latest.
Time and place: The student will work in a young team
based at the Faculty of Science, Charles University in
Prague, Czech Republic. Fieldwork will be conducted
in the Czech Republic. The position is available for up
to four years, starting in October 2016.
Salary: The PhD candidate's net monthly income will
start at 16.500 CZK (ca 610 EUR) in the rst year, and
may increase with experience and achievements during
the study. (Note that living expenses in the Czech Re-
public are generally lower than in Western European
countries.)

A competitive four year PhD studentship opportunity
in evolutionary and ecological genetics is available at
Durham University, UK.
Title:
The tness consequences of inbreeding in wild ax.
Supervisory team:
Dr Adrian Brennan, Durham University, UK, with the
co-supervision of Prof Rus Hoelzel, Durham University,
UK, and Dr Kirsten Wol, Newcastle University, UK.
Overview and application details
This project sits at the interface of evolutionary biology
and applied plant breeding and will provide the student
with valuable training and experience in next genera-
tion sequencing technologies and quantitative methods.
These are highly sought skills for careers in academia
or industry.
Full university fees and maintenance funding is lim-
ited to UK nationals and European Economic Area
(EEA) nationals who have resided in the UK for the
past three years. Other EEA nationals are eligible for a
fees only grant. If interested in applying, please contact
Dr Adrian Brennan, a.c.brennan@durham.ac.uk , with a
CV and a covering letter. The deadline for applications
is 12th February 2016.
Project description:
This project aims to improve our understanding of in-
breeding and its relationship with tness, a fundamental
aspect of evolution. We will use wild ax as a model to
study this important relationship, thereby raising the
possibility of rapidly translating results into sustainably
enhancing agricultural production via genetic improve-
ment of crops. Our research in wild ax will allow for the
comparison of natural populations exhibiting dierent
levels of selng, thereby revealing the extent to which
natural selng leads to purging and the development of
a genome more resistant to inbreeding depression. We
will use new genotyping by sequencing technologies to
obtain an unprecedented genome-wide perspective on
inbreeding and its evolution, allowing the identication
of relevant genes, and therefore the consideration of
molecular mechanisms.
Inbreeding is widely understood to reduce tness18 EvolDir February 1, 2016
through both the expression of recessive deleterious
alleles in homozygotes, and through over-dominant al-
lelic interactions. Even naturally highly inbreeding or-
ganisms cannot completely purge their genetic load by
selection because of faster drift at reduced eective pop-
ulation size. For many crops, including ax, elite lines
have been intensively inbred to optimize the stable ex-
pression of desirable traits. However, these same lines
then suer inbreeding depression. Studies of ax have
found up to 91 % heterotic increases in F1 seed yield
following controlled crosses. However, the agronomic po-
tential of heterosis has only been fully realized in hybrid
varieties of maize so far. Only recently have genotyping
technologies advanced to a stage where it is possible to
test the long-held hypothesis that heterozygosity pos-
itively correlates with tness using genome-wide data
for many individuals of non-model organisms. Initial
results are encouraging but more research is needed in
organisms showing a wider range of mating systems and
population structures to better understand the tness
consequences and genetic basis of inbreeding.

PhD Studentship in modelling the evolutionary origin
of social groups
School of Computing, Edinburgh Napier University, Ed-
inburgh, UK
Dr Simon T. Powers
Deadline: 14th January 2016
The School of Computing at Edinburgh Napier Uni-
versity is advertising fully-funded PhD studentships,
open to both UK and international students, to start
in the rst or second quarter of 2016. One of the pro-
posed studentships is to work with Dr Simon T. Powers
on modelling the evolutionary origins of social groups.
Specic projects include the evolution of protocells at
the origin of life, the evolution of multicellularity, and
the evolution of human social institutions during the
Neolithic transition from hunter-gatherer groups to agri-
cultural societies. Our main approach is to investigate
the selective drivers towards social group formation by
modelling the co-evolution of traits that aect group for-
mation, such as dispersal or group size preferences, withsocial behaviours such as cooperation and punishment.
For human evolution, we are interested in how cultural
evolution can lead to the creation of social institutions
that select for cooperation in large groups of unrelated
individuals. Our main methodology is analytical and
simulation modelling. However, we are also interested
in projects proposing the use of evolutionary robotics as
a modelling tool, and projects that propose applications
to cooperation in agent-based computing.

PhD position: Modeling ecology/evolution of a plant
pathogen, ETH Zurich
***The project***
will explore population dynamics of Zymoseptoria trit-
ici, an important fungal pathogen of wheat, using eco-
evolutionary modeling and eld/lab experimentation.
Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agricul-
ture. Current chemical and genetic technologies used to
manage plant diseases are highly vulnerable to pathogen
evolution and are not sustainable. Pathogen evolution
is facilitated by the genetic uniformity underlying mod-
ern agroecosystems. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop new, ecient and sustainable ways to controlFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 19
plant diseases.
This PhD project intends to make an important con-
tribution towards achieving this goal. The rst phase
aims at comprehensive characterization of both epidemic
and evolutionary factors of the pathogen by combining
eco-evolutionary modeling, eld/lab experiments and
genome sequence analyses. In the second phase the
models will be used to predict the rate of pathogen adap-
tation to disease control and propose optimal spatio-
temporal patterns for applications of fungicides and
resistant host varieties that can disrupt pathogen adap-
tation.
***Working conditions***
Plant Pathology group at the Institute of Integra-
tive Biology, ETH Zurich oers a creative, collabo-
rative research environment and excellent infrastruc-
ture (www.path.ethz.ch). Salary is approximately 48000
Swiss francs per year. Zurich is a vibrant, international
and green city.
The PhD project is funded for three years by the Am-
bizione grant from the Swiss National Foundation with
a possibility of extension for the fourth year.
Unique training in mathematical modeling, bioinformat-
ics and eld/lab experiments increases chances to nd
a job in academia, industry or governmental agencies.

PhD position advertised to research how bee foraging
performance and colony tness are aected by stressors
in fragmented rural landscapes'

Samraat Pawar (Life Sciences)
Location: Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College

Deadline: 18 ^th January 2016
Increased agricultural practices have resulted in the
clearance and fragmentation of many natural habitats
posing potential challenges to wildlife such as insect
pollinators. For eusocial bees (e.g. honeybees & bum-
blebees), who provide a crucial pollination service, in-
creased oral habitat patchiness may increase foraging
demands making it signicantly more dicult to sustain
the colony's energetic requirements. It is thus important
we consider how environmental stressors set limits on
bee foraging performance and how bees are able to cope
with such pressures.

Projectdescription: Human-inducedglobal changes im-

populations. The physiological symptoms of chronic
stress are changes in hormone levels that can lead to
stunted growth and increased risk of infection. Further-
more, the physiological mechanisms invoked by stressed
are similar to those in ageing individuals. Recent studies
suggest that chronic stress can lead to faster senescence
(measured in telomere shortening rates), not only in af-
fected individuals but also in their ospring. What are
the trans-generational tness consequences of a chronic
stress response, and how is it adaptive? Stress could
\prime" ospring to enable them to endure stressful con-

This projects tests the hypothesis that chronic stress
primes the next generation. To test this, we make op-
portunistic use of an exceptionally well suited long-term
\natural experiment" in wild passerines and supplement
statistical analyses on existing long-term data with fo-

PhD opportunities in Ecological Genomics
We are looking for motivated students interested in be-
havioral, evolutionary, and ecological genomics to join
our laboratory at Indiana State University (ISU). These
graduate positions are part of an exciting new interdis-
ciplinary initiative at ISU, The Center for Genomic Ad-
vocacy (TCGA), which is focused on the application of
genomic technology to the betterment of society. TCGA
is developing a state-of-the-art next generation sequenc-ing facility, which will be used to provide hands-on
experiences for students as well as strong infrastructure
for modern genomic studies.
Graduate research will be expected to combine tradi-
tional behavioral ecology studies with next-generation
sequencing technology to examine the evolution of poly-
morphism in the white-throated sparrow. Students will
conduct extensive laboratory work as well as participate
in eld based data collection during the breeding season.
This species exhibits a clear link between phenotype and
genotype, making it an ideal system in which to pin-
point the determinants of complex sexual and parental
behavior. We have amassed 27 years of detailed data
on this species making it possible to identify the ge-
netic, epigenetic, and environmental bases of behavior.
Morphs of the white-throated sparrow provide a unique
opportunity to study intraspecic genomic dierences,
which have resulted from two separate, yet linked evo-
lutionary trajectories - such results can transform our
understanding of the evolution of genomes.
To apply, please send a letter of intent, curriculum vi-
tae, and the names and email addresses of 3 references.
Applications will be accepted until January 30, 2015.

Project title: Using biogeographic and phylogenetic pat-
terns of Conophytum to inform the conservation of this
endemic genus of the Succulent Karoo
Project description:
The aim of this project is to understand the key drivers
of the current distribution and evolutionary divergence
of one of the most diverse plant genera of the Succu-
lent Karoo (SK). In doing so we will be better able to
project the potential responses of the Conophytum to
global environmental change, towards the development
of conservation measures that reduce the extinction risk
of these vulnerable taxa.
Lying within south-western corner of Africa, the SK
biome is recognised as one of the World's most impor-
tant regions of oral biodiversity. Here members of the
Aizoaceae are especially well adapted to the arid desert
environment, occupying niche habitats. This is most
evident in the speciose dwarf succulent genus Conophy-
tum, a SK specialist that shows a remarkable degree
of range-restricted endemism and 20%+ of taxa can be
considered as such [1]. The SK has also been identied
as being at high risk from the eects of climate change,
with preliminary data suggesting that dwarf succulents
may be especially vulnerable [2-4]. However, neither the
underlying mechanisms that inuence the distribution
and associated speciation of these succulents nor how
they might respond to specic environmental conditions
is understood. We now have an opportunity to address
this by bringing together a range of complimentary tech-
niques using the genus Conophytum as a model.
The project will take a unique, multidisciplinary ap-
proach, combining the expertise of the three supervisors
(spatial modelling, molecular phylogeny and evolution,biochemistry and succulent plant biology). In addition,
this study is only now possible because of the availability
of two unique resources at LJMU: (1) the student will
have full access to the most comprehensive database of
~3000 locality records covering all taxa in the genus and
(2) a genetic resource arising from a complete in situ
collection of all Conophytum taxa in the genus.
A three step approach to the work will be employed:
(1) The existing spatial database and an ensemble of
Species Distribution Modelling (SDMs) techniques (re-
gression and machine learning models) available in the
BIOMOD2 library [5,6], run and calibrated within the
R statistical programming environment [7], will be used
to quantify the role of climate and other environmental
variables on the current distribution of the 166 taxa in
the Conophytum genus. Of particular interest will be
a comparison of the climatic niches of (a) 16 dened
closely-related groups of taxa of varying vulnerability to
extinction within the genus [8,1] and (b) point endemics
(small vulnerable populations) versus those taxa with a
ubiquitous distribution. (Months 1-12) (2) The Cono-
phytum phylogeny will be reconstructed using suitable
genetic markers developed based on Next Generation
Sequencing from isolated DNA available from the in
situ collection at LJMU. This combined with the bio-
geographic and spatial data will allow an assessment of
the phylogeny in the context of the climatic and envi-
ronmental drivers. In addition, a methodology typically
applied to island endemic plants (see previous study by
Kapralov et al., 2013 in Hawaii [9]), will be applied to
the island-like populations of Conophytum on isolated
inselbergs to understand the role of adaptation during
radiation. The Conophytum phylogeny will therefore
act as the foundation for further studies and will be
used to map on it species ecology, morphology, distri-
bution, pigment composition, physiology, and anatomy.
This would allow us to better understand mechanisms
behind the evolution of the genus and to compare roles
of adaptation versus stochastic isolation for its prolic
speciation. (Months 10-30) (3) Future threats from cli-
mate change will be assessed using the SDMs outlined in
Step 1 incorporating a range of climate change scenarios
to project the impacts on the future distribution of the
Conophytum taxa [10-12]. Two time slices (2021 to
2050 and 2050 to 2080) will be used with a range of
Regional Climate Models (RCM) (CCSM3, HadCM3,
ECHAM5) and Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(SRES) (B1, A2, A1b) to provide 12 dierent climate
change datasets to account for the RCM and SRES
uncertainty in the modelling. Gap analysis will be used
to assess the eectiveness of the current protected area
network under future climates [10]. (Months 24-36 -

InsectIslandSpeciaiton
The Systematics & Evolutionary Biology Lab at the
Department of Life Sciences, National Taiwan Normal
University (NTNU) in Taipei, Taiwan is seeking a self-
motivated and enthuasiastic PhD student to work on
comparative phylogeography of ecological speciation on
Asian continental and oceanic islands.
The Project:
This research project will analyze the speciation mecha-
nism of endemic freshwater insects between Taiwan and
Yaeyama Islands of Japan (oceanic island), and between
mainland Asia and Hainan Island (continental island).
Several insect species are endemic to these islands and
show adaptation to novel environments (ecological spe-
ciation) between islands. (See a damsely example, Lee
& Lin 2012: http://web.ntnu.edu.tw/ ~treehopper/lib/-
publications libpdf/lee lin2012 molecol.pdf)
The project will generate sequence/genomic data from
multiple individuals of selected endemic species of the
islands. First, phylogenetic and population genetic anal-30 EvolDir February 1, 2016
yses will be used to infer the process of speciation be-
tween species pairs on the islands. Second, the level of
intrinsic reproductive isolation between species pairs will
be measured through crossing experiments. Third, the
strength of natural selection between species pairs will
be accessed through eld studies of tness components.
Lastly, through the analysis of genome-wide DNA poly-
morphism of target species, the genomic regions and
candidate genes underlying ecological speciation will
be uncovered. International students with an interest
in studying tropical island biology are encouraged to
apply.
Funding:
Funding includes a competitive monthly stipend of
NT$34,000 (US$ 1,133) for up to 3 years for both domes-
tic and international students through the TIGP Biodi-
versity (Taiwan International Graduate Program - Bio-
diversity) (http://biodiv.sinica.edu.tw/TIGP-BP/), a
jointed graduate program between NTNU and Academia
Sinica. Students are also eligible for on-campus housing
during the years of their studies.
Eligibility:
The position is open to all applicants that meet TIGP ad-

no Description follows below:
position as PhD Research fellow (postition code 1017)
is available at Department of Informatics.The fellowship will be for a period of 3 years, with no
compulsory work or for a period of 4 years, with 25 %
compulsory work (teaching responsibilities at the depart-
ment) contingent on the qualications of the candidate
and the teaching needs of the department. Starting
date no later than 1 October 2016. No one can be ap-
pointed for more than one xed-term period at the same
institution.
The research fellow will take part in the Centre for
Computational Inference in Evolutionary Life Sciences
(CELS). CELS is a multidisciplinary centre within life
sciences comprising strong research environments in biol-
ogy and statistical and computational methods for data
analysis. CELS addresses fundamental biological ques-
tions related to the genotype-phenotype paradigm, how
the environment aects genome evolution and develop-
ment of methods for integrated analysis of genomic and
other biotic and abiotic data. A main goal is to develop
interdisciplinary research activities generating science
of true interest for computer scientists, statisticians and
biologists.
Project description:
Metagenomics is the study of the genetic material in a
sample containing a mix of dierent microbial organisms.
These samples may have be obtained from such diverse
locations as the vertebrate gut (e.g. human or sh),
from the depths of the oceans, from the soil somewhere
on earth and so forth. Recent advances in DNA se-
quencing technologies have enabled very large amounts
of such data to be obtained for analysis. Extracting bio-
logical meaningful information from these huge datasets
involve hard computational challenges that can only be
solved by good algorithms and ecient parallelization.
Interpreting the data correctly can advance science by
a better understanding of, for example, the diversity
of ecosystems or how the immune system responds to
exposure to microorganisms.
We are seeking a highly motivated candidate to develop
new or improved algorithms or
tools for metagenomics with improved functionality, ac-
curacy or speed that will be valuable for the scientic
community. This is an opportunity to develop open
source software in areas like error detection and removal,
clustering, searching, classication, genome assembly as
well as other areas of metagenomics. We have already
contributed with tools like Swarm (http://dx.doi.org/-
10.7717/peerj.593) and VSEARCH. The successful can-
didate will be embedded in a vibrant bioinformatics
environment connected to two Norwegian Centres of
Excellence, and have access to rst-rate computational
infrastructure. The position is associated with the Cen-
tre for Computational Inference in Evolutionary Life32 EvolDir February 1, 2016
Science (CELS) at UiO. The CELS research environ-
ment oers extensive experience with high-throughput
sequencing and assembly of large genomes such as that of
Atlantic cod (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10342).
The candidate will be supervised by an interdisciplinary
team of scientists and will collaborate with other PhD
research fellows within CELS.
Requirements:
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has
a strategic ambition of being a leading research faculty.
Candidates for these fellowships will be selected in accor-
dance with this, and expected to be in the upper segment
of their class with respect to academic credentials.
Applicants must hold a Master's degree or equivalent in
bioinformatics or computer science, and need to docu-
ment good software development skills.
The candidate would need to learn ge-
nomics/metagenomics during the project, but no
formal prior knowledge of biology is required.
The purpose of the fellowship is research training leading
to the successful completion of a PhD degree.
The fellowship requires admission to the PhD pro-
gramme at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sci-
ences. The application to the PhD programme must be
submitted to the department no later than two months

RoslinInstitute UEdinburgh
CanineGenomics
Ph.D. Studentship at The Roslin Institute (University
of Edinburgh) DEADLINE: 01 FEBRUARY 2016.
We are currently recruiting a 3-year Ph.D. student to
investigate genetic diversity and evolutionary changes
in dogs using genomic techniques.
Domesticated animals provide an ideal study system
for addressing a variety of questions in biology due to
their substantial phenotypic variation, the rapid rate
of phenotypic change and the broad diversication be-
tween breeds within a species. Dogs are particularly
extreme in this regard, showing wide variation in both
physical and behavioural characteristics, and thus are
an excellent model species for questions in evolutionary
biology, genetics and behavioural biology.
The student will apply population genetic and genomics
techniques to investigate diversity within and between
dog breeds, to identify genomic regions that show ev-
idence of selection and to address whether signals of
selection are enriched in regions of the genome associ-
ated with behavioural traits, as has been hypothesized
more generally for domesticated animals. Bioinformat-
ics analyses will be applied to investigate functional
classes of genes that are enriched in genomic regions
associated with these behavioural traits and in regionsshowing evidence of selection.
The studentship will provide training in transferable
skills and techniques in quantitative and population
genetics, statistics, bioinformatics and genomic analysis.
The student will also be expected to regularly attend
seminars, journal clubs and local meetings including the
Edinburgh Alliance for Complex Traits. There will be
opportunities for attendance at national and interna-
tional conferences.
We are seeking an enthusiastic individual with an inter-
est in population and evolutionary biology and animal
genetics as well as aptitude with computer-based sta-
tistical analyses. The candidate should possess a good
quality rst degree in a relevant subject. Enthusiasm,
dedication and aptitude are the most important charac-
teristics; additional training in genetics, genome analysis
and animal behaviour are available through MSc courses
at the University of Edinburgh.

WhiteshSpeciationGenomics
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is a Swiss-based and internationally
networked aquatic research institute within the ETH
Domain (Swiss Federal Institute of Science and Technol-
ogy). It is committed to the ecologically, economically
and socially responsible management of water resources
and aquatic ecosystems.
The Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution (FishEc)
located in Kastanienbaum (Lucerne, Switzerland) has36 EvolDir February 1, 2016
a vacancy for a 1 PhD-student in Whitesh Speciation
Genomics.
Speciation research has started to address long-standing
questions on the genomic basis underlying and the
genome evolution accompanying the speciation process.
However, the accurate interpretation of genomic pat-
terns is challenging due to a variety of dierent processes,
such as drift, selection, gene ow, and recombination,
all acting simultaneously in shaping the genome and
contributing to the heterogeneity of divergence observed
along the genome. A system like the Swiss whitesh
radiation (Coregonus lavaretus complex) permits us to
assess genomic divergence along a continuum of geo-
graphic, genetic, and ecological dierentiation, in or-
der to understand which evolutionary processes drive
adaptation and divergence and to gain insights on the
genomic basis of ecological speciation.
The PhD project advertised here is aiming to build
a reference genome backbone and assess the variation
in genome structure across whitesh species in Swiss
lakes. Another goal will be to investigate the genetic
architecture of ecological and reproductive traits dier-
ing across whitesh species and to compare patterns
of genomic divergence across dierent sympatric and
allopatric species. This will require the development of
innovative analysis methods, which make full use of the
fantastic study system to enhance our knowledge on the
genomic basis of adaptation and speciation.
The successful candidate will have substantial oppor-
tunities to develop his or her own research skills and
to assist in the supervision of Bachelors, and Master
students. The work will consist of the analysis of next
generation whole genome data, the development of bioin-
formatics pipelines and tools, and the interpretation and
publication of the results. This study will be carried
out in a close collaboration between the Fish Genomics
group of Philine Feulner (http://www.eawag.ch/en/-
department/shec/main-focus/sh-genomics/ ) and the
Evolutionary Biodiversity Dynamics group of Ole See-
hausen (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/shec/-
main-focus/biodiversity-dynamics/ ) at Eawag Kas-
tanienbaum.
Applications are sought from individuals with a pro-
found interest in Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Ge-
nomics. Applicants should have earned an MSc-degree
(or equivalent) in a relevant eld of evolutionary biol-
ogy, or bioinformatics. Excellent communication skills
in English and skills in team work are essential. The
duration of the position will be three years, nanced by
the Swiss National Science Foundation.
We are a research department of Eawag (Department of
Fish Ecology and Evolution; http://www.eawag.ch/en/-department/shec/ ) and a division (Aquatic Ecology)
of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Univer-
sity of Bern, and the successful candidate will greatly
benet from the possibility to take advantage of both
these excellent academic environments. The work place
is at Eawag's Center for Ecology, Evolution and Biogeo-
chemistry in Kastanienbaum, Lucerne, which besides
the Fish Ecology and Evolution Department hosts re-
search group from the Departments \Aquatic Ecology"
and \Surface Waters - Research & Management" and of-
fers a beautiful workplace at the shores of Lake Lucerne,
a friendly international working climate and a strong
cross-disciplinary research environment. The successful
candidate will be enrolled in the University of Bern
PhD-student program.

Project: Understanding sexual selection: which sex
leads the dance when both are signallers?
Supervisor: Dr. Astrid T. Groot
http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/a.t.groot/ Sexual se-
lection generally assumes that one sex is the signaller
and the other sex the responder. The forces of sex-
ual selection are likely more complex when both sexes
are signallers and responders. In moths, the species-
specic female sex pheromones to which males are at-
tracted from a distance have been studied in detail,
because these pheromones can be used for pest manage-
ment. However, at close-range males produce and emit a
biosynthetically related but dierent pheromone, which
is likely important for close-range female choice and/or
male competition. This project aims to determine the
role of close-range courtship in generating variation in
the sexual communication channel to assess the strength
of mutual mate choice in a species where we have found38 EvolDir February 1, 2016
a within-population polymorphism in the female sex
pheromone. This project will combine behavioral and
chemical analyses with genetic (quantitative trait locus)
analyses to answer the questions whether the female and
male sex pheromone genetically linked, what are the
genes underlying the male pheromone variation, what
is the importance of male sex pheromone variation in
female choice and what is its role in male-male competi-
tion.
Requirements
-MSc in Biology, with focus on evolution, and interest
in chemical ecology and entomology;
-Experience with molecular biological techniques, prefer-
ably also with genetic analyses
-Interest to combine laboratory and eld studies with
genetic and chemical analyses
-Skills in experimental design and statistical analysis
-Prociency in scientic writing and communication

temporary basis for a maximum period of four years.
Initial appointment will be for a period of 18 months
and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a
total duration of four years. The full-time gross monthly
salary will range from 2,173 in the rst year to 2,778

I am looking for good candidates to pursue a PhD in
my group on the subject of tness of natural hybrids be-
tween two Rhinanthus species (see Natalis & Wesselingh
Oecologia 2012, Am J Bot 2012, Evolution 2013). The
aim of the project is to study tness in hybrids of known
descent and link their performance to the composition
of their genome. The work will involve eld observations
(plant size, pollinator behaviour, seed production) and
genetic analyses using NGS techniques. UCLouvain is
located in Louvain-la-Neuve, a small campus town in
the French- speaking part of Belgium, at 30 km from
Brussels, Namur and Leuven.
I need a good candidate before 15 February 2016 to in-
clude in an application for a 15-month university grant:
the results will be known in June 2016. Obtaining this
starting grant is not guaranteed (competition is quite
strong), and if it is granted, it will be necessary to ap-
ply for another type of grant to have funding for the
full 4-year PhD period, for which the rst opportunity
will present itself in September 2016. The net monthly
salary is 1831 in the rst year.
A good candidate has: - a university degree in Biology
that gives access to a PhD programme (so a 2-year MSc
degree in Europe), or will obtain a degree of this kind
before the end of September 2016 - very good study
results - a passion for evolutionary ecology - good com-
munication skills in English or French: the second grant
application process involves giving an oral presentation
and answering questions on the project in front of a
selection committee - some knowledge of bio-informatics,
especially on how to work with NGS data, would be
very useful, but is not mandatory.
If you are interested, please send me your CV and mo-
tivation by email. I will select the best candidate and
submit the rst grant proposal on 15 February 2016,
so I need to receive your declaration of interest before
Friday 12 February 2016.
For the rst grant, I will only need the CV of the appli-
cant, a detailed listing of the study results (year by year)
and the subject of the master thesis. You will not have
to have to write anything for this grant application, but
you will be involved in the subsequent grant proposal.
I have to stress that the starting grant is nominative:if your name is on the application and you decide not
to do it, I will not be able to hire someone else. So a
certain level of commitment is desirable: if you are not
sure you really want to do this, please do not apply.

students to join the lab in the Summer/Fall of 2016.
Our research focuses on the computational analysis of
genomic and transcriptomic data generated by next-
generation sequencing platforms from non-model forest
tree species. We implement this through analysis re-
lated to gene nding, gene expression, transcriptome
assembly, and conserved element identication, through
machine learning and computational statistics. We use
these methods to address questions related to genome
biology and population genomics. In addition, we de-
velop web-based applications that integrate BIG data
across domains to facilitate the forest geneticist or ecol-
ogists ability to analyze, share, and visualize their data
(http://treegenesdb.org). Such integration requires the
implementation of semantic technologies and ontologies
to connect genotype, phen otype, and environmental
resources.
Research Topics: Potential research topics in our group
include 1) development of visualization tools to support
genome-wide association studies in forest trees; 2) ap-
plication of genomic and transcriptomic techniques to
evaluate the impact of climate change on tree popula-

SharkPopulationGenetics
Graduate position: PhD or MSc Studentship
Topic: Genetic investigation of female philopatry in the
raggedtooth shark (Carcharias taurus).
The Molecular Zoology Laboratory at the University
of Johannesburg (Auckland Park, South Africa) invites
applications for a full-time PhD or MSc position (with
the option to upgrade to PhD) to investigate genetic
structure in the raggedtooth shark (Carcharias taurus)
along the South African coast.
The position is funded by the National Research Foun-
dation (NRF) for a maximum of 2 years and is available
immediately. Although the NRF gives preference to
local applicants, students from outside of South Africa
are encouraged to apply and will be selected if they
are clearly more qualied, particularly if one or more
of the following criteria apply: a) a distinction in their
previous degree (e.g. BSc honours); b) good genetic lab-
oratory skills, and preferably experience working with
microsatellites; c) at least one publication in a reputable
journal.
This project is part of a multidisciplinary collabora-
tion including Prof. Peter Teske (University of Johan-
nesburg), Dr Kolobe Mmonwa and Dr Matt Dicken
(both KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board). The student will
be based at the University of Johannesburg (http://-
bit.ly/1mnAZHo) for the duration of the project, with
occasional visits to the KwaZulu-Natal Shark Board (
www.shark.co.za). There will be no sampling trips, as
all genetic samples have already been collected.
Remuneration is R (ZAR) 40 000 per year for an MSc
position and R 60 000 for a PhD position + top-up
funding from the University of Johannesburg. A short
summary of the project is included below.
Interested students should please contact Prof. Peter
Teske: pteske101@gmail.com. Please include a) a full
CV; b) contact information of 3 academic referees, and
c) a personal statement describing research experience,
interests and career goals (500 words maximum).
Summary:
The raggedtooth shark (Carcharias taurus) is listed by
the IUCN as globally vulnerable. O South Africa, it is
commonly found along the East and South coasts, fromCape Town to northern KwaZulu-Natal. Tag-recapture
studies suggest that this species exhibits philopatry
to specic pupping, mating and gestating areas. This
project aims to use genetic samples from mature female
and juvenile sharks to investigate the extent of site -
delity, and test for genetic dierentiation among sharks
from dierent nursery areas.

GenomicsSocialOrganization
A competition funded PhD studentship at the Depart-
ment of Genetics, University of Leicester, UK
PhD title: Genomics of social organisation
Supervisors: Dr Rob Hammond & Dr Sandra Beleza
(Genetics, University of Leicester) Collaborator: Dr
Y.Wurm, (Queen Mary University of London)
The evolution of highly integrated social groups with
a reproductive division of labour, exemplied by the
eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), is a major
evolutionary transition oering unparalleled opportuni-
ties to understand how organisation at a higher level
evolves and diversies. Furthermore, changes in social
organisation are of great economic importance as they
are linked to the invasiveness and pest status of social
insects. However, to date, little is known about ge-
netic inuences on social organisation in social insects.
This is changing. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is
now able to reveal the genomic architecture underpin-
ning variation in social organisation, and, in turn, the
genomic eects of social living [1, 2].
We propose an ambitious PhD investigating the pop-
ulation genetics and genomic architecture underlying
a polymorphism in social organisation in the ant, Lep-
tothorax acervorum [3, 4].
Aims and objectives:
(1) Assess geographical variation in colony social organ-
isation among isolated populations in southern Europe
(central and north west Spain, Spanish/French Pyre-44 EvolDir February 1, 2016
nees, France & Italy). (2) Assemble a draft genome
of L.acervorum from a haploid male using PCR- free
libraries and MiSeq data. (3) Investigate signatures of
selection across the genome of L. acervorum using a com-
bination of genome re-sequencing and Restriction site
Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). (4) Compare
the genetic architecture underlying the polymorphism
in social organisation in L.acervorum with the 'social
chromosomes' found in other ant species [1,2].

GibbonEvolution
PhD in Gibbon Evolutionary Genomics at the Depart-
ment of Genetics, University of Leicester, UK , with
placements at Twycross Zoo, UK Funded for UK and
other EU nationals only.
PhD project title: Developing mobile element based
genetic markers for individual identication, captive
breeding, and conservation genetics of gibbons
Principal Supervisor: Dr Richard Badge Co-supervisor:
Dr Ed Hollox Non-academic partner: Dr Charlotte Mac-
donald Application Deadline: 31st March 2016 Start
Date: October 2016
Context: Gibbons are the smallest of the apes and com-
prise a group of highly endangered species, key to the
ecology of Asian tropical forests. Gibbons are threat-
ened by habitat loss and have been identied as priority
species for conservation by the IUCN. International con-
servation eorts have focused on habitat preservation,
but degradation of tropical forests through palm oil
planting is inexorable. As a result, maintenance, genetic
management, and expansion of zoo populations are es-
sential to gibbon conservation. Twycross Zoo is a world
leader in primate welfare, research and conservation and
plays a key role in the preservation of captive gibbon
populations. Also the Zoo's Director of Life Sciences,
Dr Charlotte Macdonald, is Chair of the Gibbon Taxon
Advisory Group for the European Association of Zoos
and Aquaria (EAZA).
Background: In addition to their critical role in tropical
ecosystems, gibbons are of intense interest to evolu-
tionary biologists, having exceptionally uid genome
structure, highlighted in the publication of the gibbon
genome in 2014. Not only are gibbon genomes evolv-
ing rapidly, but this evolution is hypothesised to be
driven by mobile genetic elements, or transposons. This
observation presents an excellent opportunity for funda-
mental research into genome evolution and dynamics (a
research focus of the Genetics Department) to synergise
with modern genomic analysis for the advancement of an-
imal husbandry, welfare and conservation. In particular,
transposon insertions are fundamental to understanding
the pace of gibbon genome evolution, but additionally
enable robust and cost-eective molecular analysis of
relatedness. This analysis is essential for maintaining
genetic health, the identication of species and hybrids,February 1, 2016 EvolDir 45
and potentially, genetic tagging of individuals for mol
ecular ecology studies.
Research: A pilot study has demonstrated that we can
identify novel (i.e. absent from the reference genome)
gibbon transposon insertions. Having established fea-
sibility, this PhD project involves expansion of this
marker panel to gain insights into genome evolution, and
conservation genetics. The pivotal role that Twycross
Zoo plays in captive gibbon population management
means the project will have unprecedented access to
samples. Successful development of individual specic
genetic markers will directly impact on animal welfare
and health, improving the long-term viability of captive
populations. In addition the potential to resolve tax-
onomic ambiguities will be an important contribution
to gibbon systematics, and fundamental research on
rapid genome evolution in these species will lead to new
knowledge of primate genome dynamics.
Techniques: The experimental aspects of the project
involve primate biosample handling, nucleic acid extrac-
tion, construction of genomic libraries, PCR, nucleic
acid electrophoresis, DNA sequencing (Sanger and NGS)
and bioinformatic analysis of gibbon and related ape
genomes. During placements at Twycross Zoo the stu-
dent will be trained in the practical and legislative
technicalities of collecting, managing and utilising sam-
ples from endangered animals (including CITES). The
student will also be trained in interpreting the Zoo's
research activity to the visiting public.

EvolutionSexualDimorphism
PhD position on the evolution of sexual dimorphism in
life-histories, at Uppsala University
A PhD position is available at Animal Ecology, the De-
partment of Ecology and Genetics, Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden, starting spring
2016.
Research focus Males and females often have dierent
optimal life histories (for example regarding rate of re-
production and lifespan), but they largely share the
same genome. This leads to conicts over trait ex-
pression. We expect stronger conict when individuals
mate with multiple partners over life and weaker con-
ict under monogamy, because then the evolutionary
interests of the sexes align. The conict can be resolved
by decoupling the genetic basis of the trait, allowing
evolution of sexual dimorphism, but the evolutionary
processes leading to such sexual dimorphism remain
poorly understood. This project will use quantitative
genetic methods combined with experimental evolution
in the nematode worm, C. remanei, to investigate how
dierent mating systems lead to changes in the genetic
basis of sexual conict over evolutionary time.
Qualications The ideal candidate will have a keen inter-
est and documented knowledge in evolutionary ecology.
You are motivated, highly reliable, driven and well-
organised, with the ability to work both independently
and in a group. The position requires an MSc degree (or
equivalent) in evolution, ecology or a related eld and
uency in spoken and written English. Strong statistical
skills are a plus.
Position The candidate will receive her/his postgrad-
uate training within the postgraduate school at the
Evolutionary Biology Centre (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
?languageId=1). The postgraduate training comprises
four years of full time studies and entitles the holder
to salary according to local salary rules and full social
benets. The position can be combined with up to 20%
of teaching assistantship, which will then prolong the
position accordingly.

BiodiversityGenomics
The Lane Lb at the University of Rhode Island is invit-
ing PhD applicants to work on a recently funded NSF
GoLife project. The focus of the project is diversity
and genomics within the Stramenopiles, Alveolates and
Rhizaria - largely microbial eukaryotic taxa that are
underrepresented in traditional databases.
The bulk of eukaryotic diversity is microbial and, when
compared to plants, animals and fungi, much of this
microbial diversity has been undersampled from the
standpoint of morphological, phylogenetic and genomic
data. This skew in data not only has consequences
for our understanding of the biodiversity of eukaryotic
life on Earth, but also how we interpret cellular and
evolutionary biology in the broadest sense. One of the
most diverse major clades of eukaryotes that has re-
cently emerged from phylogenomic analyses united the
Stramenopila, Alveolata and Rhizaria into the 'SAR'
group. Initially this clade was controversial because it
forced a re-evaluation of the evolution of several charac-
ters, most notably the spread of photosynthesis across
eukaryotes. However, additional data have robustly
supported SAR as an independent clade. Among the
diverse lineages within SAR, genomic-scale data are
rare and concentrated in only a few areas, Apicomplexa
(e.g. malarial parasites), omycetes (e.g. parasite 'water
molds') and diatoms (e.g. ecologically important phyto-
plankton). Despite their global ecological importance,
fewer than 50% of all SAR clades, and only one third of
non-photosynthetic SAR clades, are represented by evenFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 49
a single genome in public databases. This work will
add at least 250 novel genomic-scale datasets (transcrip-
tomes, draft genomes, single-cell amplied genomes),
focused primarily on capturing diversity within SAR.

A NERC funded PhD (3.5 years) is available with
Prof Jon Slate (University of Sheeld, http://jon-
slate.sta.shef.ac.uk/) and Dr Kanchon Dasmahap-
tara (University of York, http://goo.gl/RFxuOI). The
project is on the evolutionary genomics of great tits
(Parus major) but the candidate will have considerable
exibility to develop the specic questions. Details of
the project can be found here: https://goo.gl/twC09h
. We have typed approximately 2000 birds from >20
populations at a 500K SNP chip. Approximately half
of the samples come from an intensively studied popu-
lation at Wytham Woods near Oxford. The great tit
genome has recently been assembled and annotated (to a
high quality), and we collaborate with groups in Oxford
(Ben Sheldon), Wageningen (Martien Groenen) and the
Netherlands Institute of Ecology (Marcel Visser).
The lab is interested in a broad set of evolutionary quan-
titative genetic questions, and the project could focus on
one or more of the following topics: understanding the
genetic architecture of quantitative traits; identifying
genes driving adaptive evolution; exploring the role of
copy number and structural variation in evolutionary
processes; using genomics tools to understand inbreed-
ing and inbreeding depression; prediction of phenotype
from genomic data. The project does not involve lab
or eld work, and is ideally suited to an evolutionary
biologist that enjoys data analysis or other scientist with
strong quantitative skills.
The project is part of the ACCE (Adapting to the Chal-
lenges of a Changing Environment) doctoral training pro-
gram run by the Universities of Sheeld, Liverpool and
York (see https://acce.shef.ac.uk/phd-opportunities/-

will be decided by open competition between the best
candidates put forward by each supervisor.
Unfortunately NERC studentships have quite restric-
tive conditions. Applicants can be from the UK or
EU, but non-UK applicants do not receive any living
allowance (eectively ruling them out). Applications
MUST be made through the University of Sheeld

Two PhD assistantships in applied entomology are avail-
able at Boku (University of Natural Resources and Life
Sciences, Vienna, Austria). The three year project is
in close cooperation with the Insect Pest Control Lab-
oratory (IPCL) from the Joint FAO/IAEA Division
(Seibersdorf, Austria), University of Lyon 1, France and
the University of Rennes.
Two highly motivated and creative doctoral students
are sought to join the French Research National Agency
(ANR) and Austrian Science Fund (FWF) funded
project to conduct research on developing control strate-
gies for the spotted wing Drosophila y, Drosophila
suzukii. The recent invasion of D. suzukii is a major
concern for Europe's soft fruit production sector. The
objective of the project is to develop an alternative ap-
proach for controlling D. suzukii through the release
of sterile insects produced via Sterile Insect Technique
(SIT) and Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT). Pro-
tocols for mass-rearing and sterilization of D. suzukii
using radiation as well as cytoplasmic incompatible CI
Wolbachia strains shall be developed and validated.
- One PhD candidate will be responsible for developing
the mass rearing protocol for D. suzukii and establishFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 51
SIT by applying dierent irradiation protocols for reach-
ing optimal male sterility. Thus, quality control analysis
including male mating competitiveness besides others
will be performed.
- The second PhD candidate will be responsible for the
characterization of available Wolbachia-infected lines in
respect to cytoplasmic incompatibility levels and tness.
The most suitable line(s) will be further assessed for
the development and application of a combined SIT and
IIT approach in the absence of an ecient sex separa-
tion system. The selected PhD candidate will also be
responsible to assess genetic changes occurring during
domestication and/or mass-rearing.

PhDposition \Insect Community Ecology"
Thegoal of the research project is to unravel plant adap-
tations to attackby multiple insect herbivore species.
Plants respond to insect herbivoryby changing their
defence phenotype specically for the identityof the
attacker. It has been hypothesized that specicity in in-
ducedplant responses is a plant adaptation to deal withunpredictabilityof insect attack. However, a response
to one attacker maymake plants more susceptible to
attack by other herbivore species. Anoptimal defence
strategy should thus incorporate the consequences of
theinduced response. As PhD student you will study
whether various Brassicaceousplant species dier in the
predictability of exposure to insectattack, such as when,
by which species and in which order herbivoreattack
takes place and if these patterns of attack are reectedin
specic plant defence adaptations to dynamic processes
in multi-herbivoreattack. You will combine eld ex-
periments on the structureof insect communities with
plant performance measurements as wellas laboratory
experiments on insect behaviour. Within the project
youwill be closely collaborating with a PhD student
who focusses on plantphysiological responses to multi-
herbivore attack, a technician andpost-doc as well as
researchers at international institutes with expertisein
ecology, entomology and plant sciences.

Potential advisors
Marion Brodhagen: Microbiology, molecular biology,
and chemical ecology. Our lab studies the plant
pathogenic fungus Aspergillus and aatoxin, a potent
toxin produced by this fungus. Our current projects
involve the ability of certain plant secondary metabo-
lites to stop growth and/or toxin production by As-
pergillus. Future research directions will include inves-
tigations of the molecular mechanisms by which these
plant compounds alter fungal metabolism. We also are
interested in the role of Aspergillus in colonization of
plastics labeled biodegradable, in agricultural settings.
Aspergillus is a key colonizer of such plastics but its
ability to break down polymers is unclear, as is the
extent of toxin formation during plastic colonization.

University of Zurich Faculty of Science
The Faculty of Science of the University of Zurich in-
vites applications for an Assistant Professorship in Plant
Evolutionary Biology in the framework of the University
Research Priority Program \Evolution in Action: from
Genomes to Ecosystems".
Evolutionary biology is a core area of biology, and un-
derstanding the mechanisms underlying evolutionary
processes is of crucial importance for both basic and
applied aspects of biology and medicine. Beyond the
biological and medical elds, evolutionary concepts are
an important theme in the social sciences and in eco-
nomics. The University Research Priority Program
(URPP) \Evolution in Action" is set within this wide70 EvolDir February 1, 2016
area of research. It brings together multiple research
groups of the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine,
and the Faculty of Arts and plays an important inte-
grative role for diverse disciplines at the University of
Zurich (UZH). In the Plant Sciences, UZH conducts
pioneering basic research and is strongly involved in
the integrative, interdisciplinary structure of the URPP
Evolution in Action.
We seek an innovative scientist with an outstanding
track record in research and teaching, as well as the
leadership skills and enthusiasm to build on the integra-
tive structure of the URPP Evolution in Action and to
further strengthen the integration of diverse disciplines.
The successful candidate will establish a strong research
group with a focus on Plant Evolutionary Biology, using
novel approaches based on sequencing data and genome-
wide analyses to address evolutionary questions. Possi-
ble research areas are: i) genetic and genomic studies at
the population level, ii) molecular basis of adaptation
and speciation, iii) evolution of developmental processes,
iv) evolution of genomes and regulatory networks. In
teaching, the successful candidate will contribute at the
advanced level to graduate and undergraduate education
(in English or German) in Biology.
The position will be lled as a non-tenure track Assis-
tant Professorship but previous holders of such positions
have subsequently obtained a permanent professorship
at UZH. The UZH is an equal opportunity employer.
The UZH provides generous research support, includ-
ing funds for personnel and running expenses. Zurich
oers a stimulating scientic environment and extensive
opportunities for collaborations within UZH and with
ETH Zurich. Switzerland provides excellent research
funding opportunities.

BlackHills SouthDakota REU

Summer 2016 REU Position: Black Hills, South Dakota.
Project Title:
Individual variation in seasonal timing of breeding in
dark-eyed juncos- Katie Needham and Jessica GrahamFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 73
(Ph.D. Candidates, under advisement of Dr. Timothy
Greives, Biological Sciences Department, North Dakota
State University).
Description:
This project will focus on the driving forces behind why
some individuals breed earlier or later in the season than
the majority of the population. Previous research with
songbirds has shown that earlier breeding individuals
have higher reproductive success and optimize timing
with peak food abundance. While reproductive success
is higher for individuals that breed earlier, selection
is not shifting towards earlier reproduction, suggest-
ing there are costs associated with breeding early, but
the underlying physiological mechanisms of individual
variation require further exploration. Working with
the population of Dark-eyed Juncos near Hanna, South
Dakota, we hope to uncover 1) What ecological factors
aect increased reproductive success? 2) How variation
in parental care aects reproductive success? Possi-
ble REU projects will focus on the nesting period and
include observing how bacteria (presence-absence ma-
nipulation), parental care, or other ecological factors of
interest that may aect reproductive success across the
season.
Expectations:
REU will be expected to develop an independent project
related to the ongoing research with guidance from men-
tors. Student will take leadership roles in all aspects of
the study; they design the study, prepare a proposal,
collect data and perform analysis, interpret the results,
prepare a written manuscript, and complete an oral pre-
sentation at their home institution or conference. In the
eld we will work long hours in all weather conditions.
We are looking for a motivated individual who is able
to hike through steep terrain for long hours beginning
early in the morning.
In order for the REU position to be considered complete,
the following must be done:
1. Write a project proposal prior to beginning the eld
research season.
2. Participate in eld work for duration of season.
3. Write a project report in manuscript form that has
potential to be submitted for publication.
4. Present independent research in poster or talk for-
mat. Location and event for this requirement is open
for discussion. There may be funding available for a
national meeting, but presenting at own university is
also acceptable.
Compensation:A stipend, per diem, housing and travel are all provided.
After completion of the REU, you can expect to be well
trained in the ability to trap, handle, band, and process
songbirds, as well as analyze and interpret data.
Timeline:
Deadline to apply is February 15, 2016. Skype inter-
views will be oered to top candidates by February 19,
2016. REU will begin project development soon after
accepting position. REU is expected to join research
mentors at the eld site after completion of nals and
remain for 10 weeks past arrival date. Completion of the
REU project will depend on date of oral presentation.
Requirements:
To apply, email a cover letter that outlines professional
goals and research interests that fall within the project,
a resume or CV, and 1 letter of recommendation from
an instructor, research mentor, or someone who can
comment on how you would contribute to vigorous eld
research and work as an independent researcher. We are
willing to train individuals, so previous work with birds
is not required. Preferred applicants should have course
experience in elds such as ecology, behavior, and evolu-
tion. Participants are chosen for their readiness to take
on original creative eld-based biological research and
for their interest in, and potential for, a career based
in science. Applicant must plan to be enrolled in an
undergraduate program in the fall of 2016.

Bootstrapping Trees answers

Following my question about bootstraping a distance
matrix to produce a phylogenetic tree with bootstrap
condence values, I got many useful replies. My original
question is below and the replies summary is further
down this message.

and post them back on EvolDir. > > Eric>Here is
the summary of the very useful replies:
1) I cannot bootstrap the distance matrix 2) I can boot-
strap the markers (random choice with replacement)
and produce 1000 distances matrices 3) I was describing
a jackknife procedure, not a bootstrap procedure
David Remington also suggested that I could use a
nucleotide substitution model to calculate a more appro-
priate distance metric. However, he mentions that this
approach wouldn't work if the SNP dataset has been
pre-ltered, for example by retaining only the variable
markers, as it would make the nucleotide substitution
model incorrect. In our case, we have to work with pre-
selected SNPs, otherwise we would be using hundreds
of thousands of SNPs with a lot of missing data and
most of which would be variable in only one individual,
thus more probably sequencing errors.
David also asked if this was a within-species study and
it is not. It uses specimens from a variety of related
species with low numbers of samples per species. That
is why we went for a phylogenetic approach.
Jack Cameron suggested using a Canberra distance,
which is a robust Manhattan metric and then to use
Pvclust to bootstrap once I have the distance matrices.
The Canberra distance computes a distance between
two vectors P an Q of numbers by computing the sum
of, for each index i, ( jPi - Qij) / (jPij+jQij). Since
my pairwise comparisons between two samples use all
the loci for which both samples were genotyped, and
that the length of the the P and Q vectors vary among
the pairwise comparisons, I would then divide by the
length to normalize them. This leaves the problem of
encoding the possible genotypes (AA, AB, BB) as num-
bers, probably with AA=1, AB=2 and BB=3. In thiscontext, however, I do not see how dividing by (Pi +
Qi) makes any sense. It basically gives more weight to a
case of AA-AB than to a case of AB-BB since the later
will be divided by 5, compared to 3 for the former. My
implementation of the distance is equivalent to using
only the numerator ( jPi - Qij) part of the Canberra
distance and then dividing the sum by the length of the
vectors.
Any further thoughts on using a dierent distance metric
would be highly welcome!
I will then implement the following:
1) Use my VCF le with my SNP markers and bootstrap
it 1000 times 2) Use Phylip to compute the concensus
tree and bootstrap condence values 3) Keep an eye out
for how to use a dierent distance metric

Genetics Lab <Lab@chicagobotanic.org >Chromonomer Software
Hi All,
I'm pleased to release the Chromonomer software pack-
age today:
http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/chromonomer/
Chromonomer is software to integrate a genome
assembly with a genetic map to create a 'chromonome'
(1). The software will order and orient scaolds from
a genome assembly according to the markers from
a genetic map. Chromonomer was designed around
RADseq genetic maps but should work with any genetic
map where the markers can be aligned to the genome
sequence.
Chromonomer will break scaolds to ll gaps in the
assembly with smaller scaolds or to correct mis-joins
in the assembly. It will also identify markers that are
out of order with respect to the assembly. In this way
the software uses the assembly order on the small scale
and the map order on the large scale to integrate an
assembly and a map together.
Chromonomer generates extensive documentation of
where any incompatibilities occur between the assembly
and the map, including (optional) web-based visualiza-
tions.
The software is released under the GPL free software
license.
Please try it and let us know your experience with it.
Best wishes,
julian

FIELD ASSISTANT / CAMP MANAGER POSITION
AVAILABLE STUDYING WILD PRIMATE BEHAV-
IOR IN THE ETHIOPIAN HIGHLANDS
ONE eld assistant / camp manager needed for The
University of Michigan Gelada Research Project, a study
of the evolutionary biology, behavior, communication,
endocrinology, and conservation of wild geladas (Thero-
pithecus gelada) - a close relative of baboons. All re-
search is conducted at a remote eld station located
in the Simien Mountains National Park of Ethiopia.
Directors of the project are Dr. Thore Bergman and78 EvolDir February 1, 2016
Dr. Jacinta Beehner, faculty at the University of Michi-
gan. The successful candidate will be responsible for
(a) collecting basic demographic and reproductive data
as part of routine monitoring of the well-habituated
study population, (b) conducting focal animal samples,
taking growth photos, and collecting fecal and urine
samples from individually-recognized geladas (for later
laboratory steroid hormone analysis in the USA), (c)
downloading the data each day to a computer and send-
ing this data back to the U.S. on a monthly basis, and
(d) maintaining camp equipment and managing per-
sonnel. The gelada population has been studied on a
near-daily basis since 2006, and we currently recognize
approximately 250 individuals (that you will learn to
identify and love).
Our eld station is a stone hut located deep within the
national park that is shared with 0-3 American graduate
students (depending on the time of year). The project
employs 3 Ethiopian eld assistants, and 1-2 Ethiopian
sta (for cooking and cleaning) who live down the path
from the project hut in the Park outpost that consists of
4-5 rangers and their families. The hut has 3 bedrooms
(sleeps 6 comfortably), a full kitchen set-up (including a
propane-powered freezer, and a propane-powered stove
and oven), a propane-powered hot shower, solar panels
to power computers and lights, a generator (for elec-
tricity during the rainy season), a satellite telephone
and modem (for email), and a Toyota 4x4 pickup truck.
There is no running water at the eldsite, but fresh
water is brought to the camp daily from a nearby spring
(and ltered at the camp). For more information on the
project directors, the project publications, and some
photos of the eldsite, please see the project website:
http://www.umich.edu/ ~gelada/UMGRP/Home.html
. Qualied applicants will have a B.S. or B.A in Bi-
ology, Zoology, Biological Anthropology, or a related
eld. Prior travel and/or eld experience in Africa or
mountainous regions of Asia or South America preferred.
Applicants must be uent in English and eager to learn
Amharic (the national language of Ethiopia). Good
physical tness is absolutely essential - the terrain is
hilly, the air is thin (due to the high elevation), and
the temperatures can get quite cold during the rainy
season (nights are sometimes below freezing and days
can be cold). Good organizational skills and experience
with basic database management a must. Must be able
to drive a stick-shift 4x4 truck over rough terrain. Ex-
perience with leadership also a plus - as you will be
working closely with several graduate students and eld
assistants.
Salary/funding: This is a volunteer position, so there is
no salary. However, round-trip airfare and living support
will be provided for the volunteer (visa expenses, travel,meals, lodging). Additionally, volunteer will be provided
with basic accommodation, food and other basic sup-
plies while at the eld site. The volunteer is responsible
for any additional expenses incurred while traveling in
Ethiopia. The project will provide emergency travel
health insurance, but the volunteer is required to have
basic health care coverage and must acquire the nec-
essary vaccinations prior to entry to Ethiopia. The
volunteer will need to provide their own winter/alpine
condition clothing, footwear and sleeping bag. Advice
about what items are necessary for life in the Simien
Mountains will be provided to the successful applicant.
Appointment: 1-2 years beginning early-May, 2016. Be-
cause the training process requires 2-4 months (mostly
learning the animals), the successful applicant must be
willing to work for a minimum of 1 year. Applicants
committing to a longer period will receive one round-
trip ight to their home country halfway through their
internship. Note that 4 (out of 5) previous camp man-
agers have found this experience quite rewarding and
have signed on to a second year. Ethiopia is a safe and
extremely friendly country to live in.
Deadline: Position will remain open until lled. Earlier
applications will receive priority. We hope to ll the
position before the end of February, 2016.
Application: Please email the following materials to Dr.
Jacinta Beehner at jbeehner@umich.edu: (1) a letter of
interest stating how and why this position satises your
interest and future career goals,

Evolution Honors Textbook
Hello list!
I was hoping that some of you might have a suggestion
for me. I am fortunate enough to be teaching a one
credit honors seminar this coming semester tied to my
intro level evolution, diversity, and physiology course.
During the second half of the semester we will be reading
Neil Shubin's Your Inner Fish to connect the physiology
we are covering in lecture to evolutionary principles.
During the rst half of the semester I would like to
dive a little into evolutionary theory. I'm looking for
a \popular" text that is approachable to a group of
eighteen and nineteen year olds. Suggestions are greatly
appreciated and can be sent me to o list.
I thought of reading Darwin but I want to avoid the
issues of \translating English into English" that I can
already foresee. I like Dawkins, but given the population
I want to avoid anyone feeling patronized and turned
o.
Thanks for any help.

Fis variability question
Hi, I am actually working on a relict population of a
marine sh which is considered as almost extinct. Re-
production is supposed to be very rare or even absent in
the wild, and the survival of the specie is thus dependant
upon a captive stock of around 40 individuals captured
three decades ago in the wild. The specie reproduced
at around 10 years.
Using 18 microsatellites markers, I analysed the genetic
variability of breeders issued from the wild and found
that the genetic variability is very low (mean=4 alle-
les/locus), which is not surprising given the demographic
history of the specie (with sharp declines due to over-
shing and degradation of its habitat during the last
century) and the founder event (capture of these subset
of individuals for captive breeding). The Bottleneck test
from Cornuet is also signicant.
BUT, I also found also that the observed heterozygosity
is higher than expected for almost all loci, and that
Fis values are negative. My question is how these last
results could match with the evidence of low diversity,
population size and strong bottlenecks ??
Many thanks for your answers and help on that,

The REU Site program at Kansas State University 'Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology of Changing Environ-
ments: Integrating from Genomes to Biomes' invites
applicants for a 10-week summer program, which will
provide a foundation in mechanistic and integrative re-
search in ecology and evolutionary biology. We have
a diverse set of research projects addressing biological
patterns observed in changing environments and their
underlying genetic, developmental, physiological, or eco-
logical mechanisms.
The program is hosted by the Ecological Genomics Insti-
tute, Konza Prairie Biological Station, and the Division
of Biology at K-State. Over 30 faculty from the Division
of Biology and Departments of Entomology, and Plant
Pathology serve as potential mentors. Participants will
gain practical research skills in molecular techniques,
eld methods, experimental design, and data analysis;
attend professional development seminars; travel to im-
portant ecological sites and genomic centers; and have
two opportunities to present their research. The pro-
gram covers costs of accommodations. Participants will
also receive a generous stipend and food allowance.

LearningEvolution Survey
Dear Colleagues,
My name is Mindi Summers and I am a postdoc work-
ing with Michelle Smith at the University of Maine.
We are part of a multi-institutional team developing
a diagnostic assessment, called Eco/Evo-MAPS (Mea-
suring Achievement and Progression in Science) for de-
partments to use to better understand and improve
students ^A understanding of big ideas in evolution and
ecology. We have used feedback from over 70 experts,
data from more than 75 student interviews, and pilot
results from over 3000 students at 27 institutions to
revise our tool to its current state.
We are looking for a few additional institutions that
would be willing to give the assessment to their students
this spring to help us ensure the questions are working
for a diverse set of students and institutions. The as-
sessment is taken online outside of class and typically
takes students 30-40 minutes to complete. Students are
usually given a few participation points for their eorts.
Eco/Evo-MAPS questions are organized so that each
consists of a prompt followed by a series of statements
that students will answer as likely or unlikely - a varia-
tion on true/false. To give you a sense of the instrument,
I have included below a link to one of the ten total ques-
tions.
https://umaine.qualtrics.com//SE/?SID=-
3DSV bIQlMb8EvIa2vFH Once the students have
completed the Eco/Evo-MAPS assessment, we will send
you a score report. The overall averages are reported
plus a breakdown of questions by core concepts in
ecology and evolution and the ve Vision and Change
core concepts. We will also work with your IRB oce
to make sure we have the proper permission to survey
your students.
Thank you for considering this request! We hope you
are interested in being part of the development process.
Thank you,

WaspSocialityEvolution
A volunteer eld assistant is required to help with a
eld-based project on behaviour in social wasps. The
position is a fantastic opportunity to gain tropical eld
experience working in a vibrant research group, led by
Dr. Seirian Sumner, from the University of Bristol, UK
( http://www.sumnerlab.co.uk/). This exciting project
combines behavioural experiments with the latest se-
quencing techniques to understand the molecular mecha-
nisms behind sociality. The eldwork will be conducted
in Frasers Hill, Malaysia for three months between July
and September 2016. The work involves marking wasps,
manipulations, conducting censuses, sample collections,
and behavioural observations.
Assistants are generally expected to be biological sci-
ence graduates with a good degree (2:1 or equivalent) or
Masters graduates. A background in molecular biology
is not necessary as eldwork is behavioural based - a
keen interest in behavioural ecology, social evolution,
and/or entomology is required. Applicants should be t,
enthusiastic, hard working and happy living in shared
accommodation and working in challenging conditions.
Previous experience of working on social insects would
be an advantage. The applicant must be able to commit
to the full eld season. These wasps can sting when
provoked, so applicant must have no know previous al-
lergies to wasp/bee stings. Due to the nature of work
you may also be required to work up ladders, and must
have full colour vision.
Work-related costs in Malaysia will be paid for, including
accommodation and ights (up to ^A$500). Worldwide
applicants are supported, although must be uent in
English. Costs related to food are expected to be self-
funded (Malaysian prices are much cheaper than UK)
and the balance towards ights over ^A$500.
Please contact Dr. Daisy Taylor
(daisy.taylor@bristol.ac.uk) for more details. Ap-
plications should include a CV with email addresses for
two referees and a 1-page cover letter explaining why
you would like to work on the project. Applications
should be submitted by e-mail to Dr. Daisy Taylor .
Shortlisted applications will be notied by email, and
will be invited for interview either in person or over

Preferential sampling through time when estimating
changes in eective population size Vladimir Minin Uni-
versity of Washington Monday, February 8, 2016, 10:00
AM PST
Phylodynamics seeks to estimate eective population
size uctuations from molecular sequences of individuals
sampled from a population of interest. However, when
analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, cur-
rent methods implicitly assume either that sampling
times are xed deterministically by the data collection
protocol or that their distribution does not depend on
the size of the population. Through simulation, we86 EvolDir February 1, 2016
rst show that, when sampling times do probabilisti-
cally depend on eective population size, estimation
methods may be systematically biased. To correct for
this deciency, we propose a new model that explic-
itly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the
sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process
dependent on eective population size. We demonstrate
that in the presence of preferential sampling our new
model not only reduces bias, but also improves estima-
tion precision. Finally, we compare the performance
of the currently used phylodynamic methods with our
proposed model through seasonal human inuenza ex-
amples. Our analysis demonstrates that inuenza data
sets constructed by mining sequence databases do con-
tain strong preferential sampling signal. Accounting for
this preferential sampling produces a markedly cleaner
picture of inuenza population dynamics.

rita.covas@gmail.comRobertKeithSelander Obituary
My former colleague Robert K. Selander died last June,
but I have not seen an obituary in journals or elsewhere.
The following is an obituary that I wrote for our depart-
mental web site and I share it now with the evolutionary
biology community now.
Robert Keith Selander, emeritus faculty member of the
Biology Department, died on June 14, 2015 at the age of
87. He received his B.S. in Zoology from the University
of Utah in 1950, his M.S. in Zoology from the University
of Utah in 1951, and his Ph.D. in Zoology from the
University of California at Berkeley in 1956. He was
a member of the faculty at the University of Texas at
Austin from 1956 to 1974 and moved to the University
of Rochester in 1974. He received numerous honors
over his career which culminated with his election into
the National Academy of Sciences in 1982. In 1987, he
joined the biology faculty at Penn State where he helped
to assemble a group of molecular evolutionary geneti-
cists. Dr. Selander held the Eberly Chair in Biology
from 1987 until his retirement from Penn State in 1999.
Dr. Selander published over 200 papers in his career.
During the early part of his career, he focused on behav-
ior and evolution in birds. He was a pioneer in applying
molecular genetic approaches to the study of genetic
structure of populations that included classic studies of
genetic structure in house mouse populations as well as
work on the origins of blind cave shes. In the 1980s, Dr.
Selander began to apply molecular genetic approaches to
understand the structure of bacterial populations includ-
ing many pathogenic organisms that were responsible
for human disease outbreaks. This included work on
Salmonella, an agent that leads to food borne illnesses,
and Neisseria meningitidis, the bacterial species that
causes meningitis. Dr. Selander trained and mentored
many talented graduate students and postdocs. His
work has been cited over 17,000 times showing the pro-
found impact that his scientic work has had in the eld
of evolutionary genetics. Dr. Selander loved music of all
types from classical music and opera to contemporary
standards. He was an accomplished pianist and musical
arranger. He also had important insights into modern
culture. He once opined that one only needs to watch
the last two minutes of a basketball game to see the
salient aspects of the contest.

Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis).
Voluntary eld research assistant: Mid-February to Mid-
May 2016 (3 months)
We are looking for one voluntary eld research assistants
to conduct research on the completely subterranean,
highly social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damaren-
sis). Specically, this project investigates the group
augmentation hypothesis and how benets of living in
large groups can generate selection for altruism in ani-
mals. We are currently conducting a large scale capture-
mark and recapture experiment running over one year
in which the voluntary research assistant would play an
important role. Field work takes place in the southern
Kalahari, Northern Cape province of South Africa in a
private game reserve. Entire groups of mole-rats will
be captured and individually marked. Morphological
measurements and tissue samples will be obtained be-
fore the release of the animals. The work is physically
demanding (heavy digging to capture mole-rats) and
weather conditions are very challenging (heat during
the day, cold during the night). Field work will make
trapping during the night necessary. The assistant will
mostly be working along one more experienced scientist
but will need to work independently at times.
Applicants should be enthusiastic, willing to work hard
and keen to get involved in an ecological research project
in the African bush. The research assistants are ex-
pected to be willing to work at night when trapping
schedules require it and need to be t as capturing
mole-rats requires the capacity to do hard physical work
(digging) in a challenging environment. Applicants must
be holders of a driving license. A zoology related degree
and/or previous eld experience will be considered an
asset. The successful applicant will work in a small
team of 2 persons and hence need to be a team player
and generally a person that enjoys collaboration under
sometimes challenging and isolated circumstances.What you will learn:
Conduct eld research in a remote area in the African
bush.
Capture-mark and recapture techniques of small ro-
dents.
Biological sampling and processing of scientic samples
(blood, tissue and morphometrics).
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants are
paid a weekly allowance to cover their personal costs
and food. Costs for travelling from Johannesburg to the
eld site will be covered. We have no funding to cove
overseas travel to South Africa.
Applications received until the 15th of January 2016 are
ensured full consideration. Later applications can be
considered.

Statistics
withOrdinalResponsePlusPhylogeny
Dear evoldir community,
I would like to conduct a simple statistical analysis,
where I test the eect of a categorial variable on an
ordinal one, but correcting for phylogeny. The problems
are :
- regarding the phylogeny, I have no information about
branch lengths and it also presents several polytomies
->from what I read, it would appear that a classical
PGLS method can deal with those problems
- the response (dependent) variable is ordinal(around 6
categories)
->PGLS can be used for continuous or discrete explana-
tory variables, but I found nothing about ordinal ones...
I saw that for ordinal response variables, \cumulative
logit models" could be used, but they do not make use of
the phylogenetic information. The best would probably
be a mix of the two, but since I do not know a lot about
those kind of analyses, maybe I just miss something?
Any help or advice would be much appreciated!
Thank you all very much in advance.

to species; line-point intercept will be used to gather
species cover and composition data; shrub density will
be measured; and soil descriptions will be required.
All point data will be gathered using a GPS unit and
stored in an ArcGIS geodatabase. Data are entered into
Database for Inventory, Monitoring, and Assessment
(DIMA) on site with ruggedized tablets and are further
analyzed and synthesized into various reports for future
land management planning. DIMA requires a high level
of Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), there-
fore attention to detail is paramount for these positions.
Subsequent, professional reports must be completed and
will involve the presentation of scientic data and pre
and post treatment analysis. Crew may be camping 1-4
nights/week, depending on location.
General Qualications: Applicants should have a degree
in ecology, botany, range science, soil science, wildlife
biology, natural resource management, biology, conser-
vation biology, or a related eld. Identifying plants to
species and experience with a taxonomic key is essential
to the position. Familiarity with northern New Mex-
ico ora is benecial. The successful applicant must
be self-motivated and able to work independently with
limited supervision after the initial training period. Ap-
plicants with previous AIM or Indicators of Rangeland
Health training are highly preferred. Background in
statistics/Microsoft Suite, including Access, is addition-
ally useful. The applicant must be able to maneuver and
operate in a mixture of oce and eld work, which can
include long periods of standing or walking on rough,
uneven ground; bending, crouching, stooping, stretching
or reaching to observe occurrences or place and retrieve
equipment or devices; lifting and moving moderately
heavy items. Applicant must be physically t, able to
stand and walk for long periods of time (at a minimum 6
miles/day) and lift items that weigh up to 40 pounds in
upwards of 100 degree heat. A government vehicle will
be used for work travel but a personal vehicle is highly
recommended for travel to and from the duty station
and for personal time. There is potential for working
in adverse conditions including extreme heat and mon-
soonal rains and hazardous wildlife (i.e. rattlesnakes,February 1, 2016 EvolDir 89
scorpions), so eld safety skills and risk management
are important. The successful applicant will also attend
CPR, First Aid training and Defensive Driving (or pro-

Switzerland Internship
BatLifeHistoryEvol
Internship for undergraduate/ Master's degree student
for the bat projectTopic: Impact of early life condition on alternative re-
productive tactics in bats.
Context: Oxidative stress is considered to be a major
mechanism impacting on life history trade-os. Carollia
perspicillata, a neo-tropical bat, shows two reproductive
tactics, with harem males defending a territory, and
bachelor males.
Early life experiences have long lasting consequences
on an individual. To understand how early conditions
impact the future \choice" of the reproductive tactic,
we will manipulate the growth rate of babies, using food
restriction.
The project is based at the university of Neuch^ atel,
Switzerland. We study a captive bat colony (Papilio-
rama http://www.papiliorama.ch). Bats can y freely
under a 40m-diameter dome, which includes an articial
cave. The light cycle is reversed, allowing us to work
during the day. Therefore, it is a unique opportunity to
study bats, animals still largely unknown.
Tasks of the intern, in collaboration with the PhD stu-
dent working on the project:
- Planning of the experiment
- Help to feed the bas that are in cages during the
experiment
- Regular trapping of new gravid females
- Participation in blood collection
- Behavioral observation
- Possibility of lab work
About the position:
- It can be part of your studies. Therefore, the candidate
is welcome to conduct a personal research project linked
to the main project.
- Unfortunately it is not paid, but a grant is available
via the University of Neuch^ atel with an internship agree-
ment (420 swiss francs per month).
- Minimum duration of two months, if possible starting
in March. The starting/ending dates are very exible,
as this experiment will last a long time.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
To apply, please send a CV and a cover letter to ma-
gali.meniri@unine.ch with \application bat internship"

What do we work with?
Volker Loeschcke ~A^As group:
We study thermal adaptation using Drosophila as a
model system. We ask if temperature is the primary
driver of adaptation to environmental gradients using ex-
perimental evolution approaches as well as studies that
are experimentally simulating temperature gradients in
climate chambers. We try to connect studies at the
DNA level (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and
metabolomics) with studies on thermal phenotypes and
try to create ecologically relevant scenarios. We contrast
physiological (plasticity) and evolutionary adaptations
and look at uctuating and unpredictable environments,
variation in day length, dietary composition and the roleof the microbiome on thermal resistance. We are also
interested in other climate-related resistance traits and
lifespan, their genetic architecture, phylogenetic con-
straints and correlations and interactions among traits,
and transgenerational eects and epigenetics.
Trine Bilde ~A^As group:
We study population genetics, adaptation, and group-
living using social spiders as model system. The so-
cial spiders are unique among group living animals,
as the transition to permanent sociality is associated
with strong inbreeding, cooperative breeding, and highly
female-biased sex ratios. Our research aims to under-
stand the ecology and evolution of sociality, reproductive
division of labour, and population genomic consequences
of inbreeding. Social spiders show extremely low genetic
variation but occupy wide habitat ranges with strong
temperature and humidity clines. We are interested
in understanding how plastic and environmentally de-
termined factors (epigenetics, microbiome) inuence
adaptation. Our research is mainly performed on the
African genus Stegodyphus that contains both social and
subsocial (pre-social) spiders, which allows comparative
studies.
Michael M. Hansen ~A^As group:
We investigate how species and populations are adapted
to the environments they inhabit. We are interested in
if and how they can respond to rapid, anthropogenic
environmental change such as climate change, but also
analyze adaptation and demographic history on longer,
historical time scales. Our primary model organisms are
shes, including Anguillid eels, threespine stickleback,
Arctic char, lake whitesh and brown trout, but we are
open for suggestions involving other organisms as well.
We currently have a strong focus on Greenland, which
is one of the regions on Earth experiencing the most
drastic climate change. Our research is to a large extent
based on whole genome sequencing and various meth-
ods for reduced representation genome sequencing (e.g.
RAD sequencing), which we integrate with analysis of
phenotypic traits. We foresee a major future emphasis
on epigenetics and its roles in adaptation.
How does it work?

Cornell GenomicsSocialWasps
Postdoctoral position in comparative and population
genomics of Polistes paper wasps
The Sheehan lab at Cornell University seeks a postdoc
for comparative and/or population genomics projects
using Polistes paper wasps as a model system. Paper
wasps are a diverse group of primitively eusocial insects
that have served as a model group in studies of social
behavior. Among the notable traits of the group is the
presence of substantial variation in the level of cooper-
ation between populations and species. Additionally,
complex social is associated with the highly polymorphic
color patterns within populations used for individual
recognition and quality signaling in dierent species.
From a population genetics perspective, Polistes waspsare especially appealing for a few reasons including small
genome sizes, males are haploid allowing for perfectly
phased data and wasps are abundant in a wide variety of
habitats making it easy to get large numbers of samples.
They can also be reared in the lab.
A 2-3 year position is available (initial 12 month ap-
pointment with the possibility of renewal). Start date is
exible. Information about salary and benets at Cor-
nell can be found here: https://postdocs.cornell.edu/-
postdoctoral-associates-benets . The lab is especially
interested in using comparative and population genetic
approaches to examine the evolutionary causes and con-
sequences of cooperative nesting and visual recognition
in wasps, though postdocs are welcome (and encouraged)
to develop independent projects making use of popula-
tion and comparative genomic data being generated by
the lab.
In addition to population and comparative genomics, the
postdoc will have the opportunity to conduct eldwork
in the US or abroad, conduct behavioral or cognitive
experiments and/or carry out molecular work depending
on the nature of the project and the postdoc's interest.
Required qualications:
Ph.D. or equivalent degree in biology, evolution, ge-
netics, bioinformatics, or related eld. Publication of
work based on dissertation. Working knowledge of bioin-
formatics pipelines and standard population genomic
analyses. Prociency in scripting language (e.g. Python
or Perl) and depth in some area of comparative or pop-
ulation genomics is strongly preferred. Prior wet lab or
eld experience is not required.
To apply please submit a cover letter describing your
relevant experience and interest, a CV, the contact infor-
mation for three references, and 1-2 relevant publications
to Dr. Michael Sheehan (msheehan@cornell.edu).

Thelaboratory of Matt Hare at Cornell University is
looking for a postdoc with diverse skills to lead projects
on tness variation in hatchery-produced F1 vs. wild
eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica). This research
is motivated by the need for improved success rates in
hatchery-based oyster restoration and more generally
to measure within-generation selection and its eects in
high-fecundity species. Hatchery production of restora-
tion oysters from wild brood stock typically results in a
cohort with low allelic diversity and a broad range of
individual heterozygosities compared with wild oysters.
The postdoc will take the lead analyzing and publish-

Postdoctoral position: Genetics and evolution of devel-
opmental plasticity, Ragsdale Lab, Indiana University
A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of
Erik Ragsdale, Department of Biology, Indiana Univer-
sity, Bloomington. Our lab investigates the genetic reg-
ulation and evolution of developmental plasticity, specif-
ically a polyphenism that involves novel morphological
and ecological traits. The focal species of this research
is the nematode Pristionchus pacicus, an emerging
model system for evolutionary developmental genetics,
which our lab studies using forward and reverse genetics,
transgenics, and genome-wide approaches.
P. pacicus alternatively develops into a microbe-feeding
or a predatory morph in response to dierent environ-
mental cues. Recent work has begun to characterize
the genes that make up a developmental switch for the
polyphenism, providing an entry point into the genetics
of a morphological dimorphism in a tractable animal
model. Moreover, this species is embedded in a solid
phylogenetic infrastructure with a broad range of feeding
morphologies and ecologies. Given the laboratory avail-
ability of many species and populations of Pristionchus,
this system oers a unique opportunity to discover how
genetic factors and their interactions evolve to modify
developmental plasticity.
The goal of the project is to determine the signicance
of an increasingly understood polyphenism mechanism
in evolutionary process. Approaches will involve popu-
lation genetics, evolutionary modeling, and/or experi-
mental evolution. For the position, we seek a collegial
and intellectually driven individual with a recent Ph.D.
in evolutionary biology or a related eld. A strong
background in population genetics and/or evolutionary
modeling is essential. Molecular biology skills are a plus

position will be funded for two years, with the poten-
tial to extend for an additional year. Salary will be
commensurate with experience, and full benets are
included.

Bioinformatics PostDoctoral Position in Turtle Dosage
Compensation
A postdoctoral position is available to work in the labo-
ratory of Dr. Nicole Valenzuela at Iowa State University
on an NSF-funded project to study the evolution of
dosage compensation using turtles with independently
evolved XX/XY and ZZ/ZW sex chromosome systems.
The project combines bioinformatics, transcriptomics,
molecular cytogenetics, and phylogenetic analyses.
*Project description: Species with sex chromosomes face
the challenge posed by dierential gene dosage between
XX and XY individuals (or ZZ and ZW) that may lead
to disease, suboptimal phenotypes or death. Dosage
compensation is a mechanism to equalize the activity
of X- or Z-linked genes between sex chromosomes and
autosomes, and between males and females. As part of
this NSF-funded project we are leveraging the multiple
independently-evolved sex chromosome systems found
in turtles to study the evolution of dosage compensation.
The successful candidate will help uncover the full di-
versity of dosage compensation mechanisms and their
molecular underpinnings by contrasting turtles with al-
ternative sex-determining mechanisms, leveraging and
augmenting turtle genomic resources.*Position Requirements: The ideal candidate will have
a PhD degree and strong background in bioinformatics,
including genome assembly and transcriptome analyses.
Other qualications such as evolutionary biology back-
ground or experience with molecular biology and molec-
ular cytogenetics are a plus but not required.
*Position details: Funding is available for 2-3 years with

Project ummary
Figs and their g wasp pollinators and parasites have
co-evolved for ~90 million years to become both highly
diverse ( >750 species of gs) and ecologically important
^A^Akeystone ^A^Acomponents of tropical forest ecosys-
tems. Figs and wasps have long been assumed to repre-
sent a case of strict co-speciation, with highly specic
pollinator and parasitic (non-pollinator) wasps identify-
ing appropriate hosts via distinctive volatile chemicalsignals. More recent studies suggest a more complex
scenario, however, involving an evolutionary history
punctuated by host-shifts by individual wasp species.
Although the wasp associations with g hosts have been
widely studied, the genetic consequences for the host
gs of host-shifting pollinators and the mechanisms un-
derlying host recognition remain poorly understood.
This project will ll these gaps by producing robust,
detailed, many-gene phylogenies for 14 strangling g
(Ficus) species and their associated pollinating (Pegosca-
pus) and non-pollinating (Idarnes) g wasps ( ~60
species) from the vicinity of Barro Colorado Island,
Panama. Using transcriptome sequences, we will tar-
get~300 genes from each of three species per lineage
for capture and subsequent Illumina sequencing. Phy-
logenies will be inferred using Bayesian methods and
will enable robust testing of phylogenetic congruence
between gs and g wasps. Further, they will guide
population-level genotype by sequencing to test a priori
predictions of potential cases of hybridization in the gs
and host shifting and race formation in both pollinator
and non-pollinator wasps. Combined with quantica-
tion of wasp-attracting g volatiles and fruit-surface
chemicals, this work will detect and resolve the genomic
consequences of host introgression due to host-shifting
pollinator wasps, and link them to the chemical basis
of host-recognition.
This research will signicantly clarify both the patterns
and processes underlying the evolutionary ecology of g
and g wasp interactions. Our standardized, genomic
approach is essential for: 1) obtaining robust g and
g wasp species trees, 2) delimiting g species and dis-
criminating cases of introgressive gene ow from shared
ancestral polymorphism,

Rosco France MarineGenomics
Scientic project
This project is part of HAPAR ANR (Head L. Guillou),
in collaboration with the ABiMS platform (Analysis
and Bioinformatics for Marine Science) at the Station
Biologique of Rosco (France), the University of Ghent
(S. Rombauts, Y. Van de Peer), and the Genoscope (P.
Wincker, B. Porcel, France).
Microalgae can produce harmful and/or toxic blooms.
These microalgae have many pathogens, especially
roughly specialist eukaryotic microparasites. In cul-
tures or in the eld, these parasitoids are able to limit
the growth of their host and thus to limit the impact of
these blooms. These parasitoids, harmless to humans,
are close to many human pathogens such as Plasmod-
ium falciparum, the malaria agent. In the ANR project
HAPAR (2014-2019), we focus on the molecular mecha-
nisms related to the specialization of these parasites.
As part of this work a full analysis of the genomes of two
parasitic dinoagellates will be realized, one specic of a
genus and one that can infect two dierent genera. The
sequencing of these two genomes was performed and
RNAseq data is already available for the annotation of
these genomes, RADseq/MIG seq and proteomic data
will also be available soon. These studies will highlight
process (and products of metabolism) involved during
host invasion.
Context The Marine Station provides to the scientic
community a bioinformatics platform, ABiMS, in which
the research will be conducted. The Ghent site on
its side provides the ORCAE genome curation platform
that will be used during the project. The postdoc will be
under the responsibility of the head of the ABiMS plat-form with the co supervision of L. Guillou (UMR7144).
He / she will interact with the dierent partners of the
projects: the Ghent university and the Genoscope.
Missions The postdoc will be in charge of the genome,
RADseq/MiGseq and RNAseq data analyses. From the
rst results of automatic annotation of these genomes
produced by Genoscope, the postdoc will work on the
improvement of the structural and functional annota-
tion using NGS data. The study of the phylogenetic
evolution of some gene families and species delineation
will also be considered. Pipelines in place for the anal-
ysis will be deployed under the Galaxy platform for a
valuation to the community.
Skills - Good experience of eukaryote genome annotation
- Strong knowledge of NGS analysis tools and methods,
and particularly in RNAseq and/or RADseq/MIGseq
analysis - Good knowledge of phylogeny - Good knowl-
edge of statistical analysis - Advanced knowledge of
scripting languages (Perl, Python,$B!D(B) and/or in
Linux and Unix - Global knowledge in genetics and
molecular biology - Ability to work and integrate a
team - Autonomy, rigor and openness
The salary is currently 1880 up to 2100 euros / month
Contract starting : as soon as possible
Location : Rosco / France
Limited term contract with funding available for 15
months (could be extended to 24 months)

Post-doc position: Eects of linked selection on plant
genomic variation
A two-year post-doc position in evolutionary genomics is
currently available at Stockholm University/SciLifeLab,
in the research group of Dr. Tanja Slotte.
Background Recent genomic studies have shown that
the interaction between selection and recombination, or
linked selection, can have a profound impact on genetic
diversity. However, our understanding of the factors that
determine variation in the type and strength of linked
selection among organisms remains limited, especially
in plants.
Project The post-doc will contribute to a project that
aims to investigate the impact of plant mating systems
on linked selection. This will involve analyses of popu-
lation genomic data, coupled with simulations to assess
the genomic signature of linked selection. Whole-genome
sequence data sets of plant populations are already avail-
able, and more are currently being generated in the lab.
The project therefore oers plenty of opportunities for
the post-doc to devise analysis strategies using available
genomic data.
Infrastructure and environment The Slotte lab (http://-
tanjaslottelab.se) is part of the Dept. of Ecology, Envi-
ronment and Plant Science, Stockholm University. We
are located at Science for Life Laboratories in Stockholm
(http://www.scilifelab.se), which holds considerable ex-
pertise in high-throughput sequencing technology and
bioinformatics. The working atmosphere is international
with English as the working language, and the position
oers plenty of opportunities for scientic exchange
with geneticists, evolutionary biologists and ecologists
at SciLifeLab and Stockholm University. The city of
Stockholm is known for its beauty, its buildings and
architecture and its abundant clean and open water.
Qualications We are looking for a post-doc with a
strong background and interest in population genetics,
with the prerequisite bioinformatic skills to carry out
analyses of population genomic data sets. Candidates
should have knowledge in at least one major program-
ming or scripting language and be able to work in a
Linux/Unix environment. A good understanding of
statistics and prociency in R is a plus. The candidate
should have excellent writing skills, and be able to workFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 113
both independently and as part of a team. Candidates
should have a PhD in population genetics/evolutionary
genetics, or a closely related eld.
Application information Review of applications will be-
gin on February 20th, 2016, and will continue until the
position is lled. The position is available immediately,
or as agreed upon with the successful candidate.
Applications should include: 1) a letter of interest /
background (2 pages max), 2) a complete CV, including
a list of publications, 3) the names and e-mail addresses
of three referees, all in a single pdf le.

Toulouse GenomicClimateWarming
20 months Postdoctoral fellowship: Molecular basis of
responses to climate warming in an ectotherm species
At the Department of Evolution & Biological Diversity,
France (Toulouse, CNRS - UPS)
Project objectives
The position is oered within an ANR project,
FRADISYN. This project aims at understanding the
consequences of fragmentation and global warming on a
lizard species, the common lizard (/Zootoca vivipara/).
The major objective is to predict responses to global
warming through plastic and evolutionary changes of dis-
persal behaviour and thermal physiology (heat absorp-
tion, thermal preferences).We created, in a semi-natural
experimental system, several habitat patches connected
by corridors and manipulated for their climatic con-
ditions. In order to study how common lizards can
adapt to global warming, we measured phenotypic varia-
tion (behaviour, melanism and thermal preferences) and
life history traits (dispersal, survival, growth) through
successive generations of populations maintained in dif-
ferent climatic conditions (e.g. Bestion et al. 2015, Plos
Biol., Bestion et al. 2015 Eco. Lett.). Using this ap-114 EvolDir February 1, 2016
proach allows us to tease apart the inuence of dispersal,
selection and phenotypic plasticity into the response to
climate change.
The post-doc fellow will primarily work on the molecular
part of the project. Along with the monitoring of pheno-
typic traits, we collected DNA samples on all individuals
and we recently obtained the transcriptome of few in-
dividuals characterized for their phenotype (dispersal,
behaviour, melanism and thermal preferences) and from
dierent climatic conditions. The main objective for
the post-doc fellow is to detect genomic footprints of
selection in response to climate change. The work will
be performed in two steps: (i) thanks to this transcrip-
tome and to the existing literature, we will select few
candidate genes to be sequenced on a subset of indi-
viduals to study the selection processes which occurred
during the past experiments on the basis of nucleotidic
polymorphism. (ii) Furthermore, we started a long-term
experiment manipulating climatic conditions and con-
nectivity among patches in a full-crossed design. This
experiment will provide the opportunity to monitor si-
multaneously the changes in nucleotidic polymorphism
and in gene expression in response to warmer climates
and fragmentation.
Task of the postdoctoral fellow
The recruited researcher will be in charge of 1) selecting
candidate genes from the literature and the transcrip-
tomic dataset, 2) performing the associated molecular
biology work (extraction, PCR, sequencing), 3) col-
lecting extra samples for gene expression analyses and
performing these analyses (including qPCR) and 5) ana-
lyzing data (population genetic framework) and writing
articles. This work will likely lead to, at least, two
articles as a rst author.
Required skills
Able to manage research and administrative activities
Knowledge in evolutionary ecology and the molecular
basis of evolution.
Conceptual and technical knowledge in molecular biol-
ogy
Able to actively participate as a member of a research
team.
Good written and verbal communication skills
Experience with genomic data manipulation and statis-
tical analysis

UCapeTown AvianCoevolution
Post-doctoral research opportunity at the Percy Fitz-
Patrick Institute of African Ornithology, Department of
Biological Sciences, University of Cape TownProject: Sociable Weaver nests as a resource to animal
communities and the life history of the obligate associate
African Pygmy Falcon
We invite applications for the above full-time research op-
portunity at the FitzPatrick Institute, a world-renowned,
national Centre of Excellence (CoE) in ornithological
research with a strong emphasis on postgraduate stud-
ies. The tenure of the Fellowship is for 2 years, with
possible extension to a 3rd year considering satisfactory
academic progress and availability of funds.
The successful applicant will focus on the interactions
in animal communities associated with Sociable Weaver
(Philetairus socius) nests, with particular focus on the
role of the closely associated African Pygmy Falcon
(Polihierax semitorquatus). The candidate will conduct
research with Dr Robert Thomson. Applicants must
have strong analytical skills, including a demonstrated
expertise in programming with R. Supervision experi-
ence of post-graduates and a good publication record
for the career stage are also desirable.
This project examines the importance of Sociable
Weaver nests to a desert animal community and the role
of African Pygmy Falcons in these communities. The
exact research questions will be tailored to, and devel-
oped with, the successful candidate. The research could
focus on the diet, behaviour, demography and physiol-
ogy of the African Pygmy Falcon, investigating how the
evolution of the species life history strategy is linked
to its obligate association with Sociable Weaver nests
(weaver nests provide the only nesting substrate used by
the falcons in southern Africa). The research could also
use the falcon-weaver system as a co-evolutionary model
to understand the interplay between climate and biotic
interactions in shaping the South African distribution
of these two species. Areas of mismatch (where weavers
are present but not falcons) could be identied and ad-
ditional eldwork would enable to collect environmental
data aimed to explain the absence of Pygmy falcons in
these areas. Ultimately, by integrating multi-species in-
teractions into an ecological niche modelling framework,
this project will oer a unique opportunity to predict
the future range of this Kalahari falcon under dierent
scenarios of climate change.
The researcher could also help supervise a recently initi-
ated and closely linked PhD project investigating the
diversity of species utilizing weaver nests and their inter-
actions in an aridity gradient across the weaver range.
Conditions of the award of a Postdoctoral Fellowship at
UCT are: (i) postdoctoral fellowships are only available
to individuals who have achieved a doctoral degree in a
relevant subject within the past 5 years. (ii) applicants

researcher to participate in a USDA-funded project
that uses comparative genomics to investigate the ge-
netic basis of ecological specialization in plant-feeding
insects. The ultimate goal of the project is to test
the hypothesis that changes in host use involve pre-
dictable genetic changes. To test this hypothesis, we
are combining chemosensory gene annotations and host-
use data from an experimentally tractable and well-
studied group of pine-feeding insect pests in the genus
*Neodiprion* (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae). This project
dovetails with ongoing work in the lab that seeks to un-
derstand both the causes (molecular mechanisms) and
consequences (population divergence and speciation)
of phenotypic variation. For additional details about
current research in the lab, please visit our website:
http://www.linnenlab.com/ . The ideal candidate will
be independent, organized, and motivated and have
a keen interest in using genomic/transcriptomic data
to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biol-
ogy. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in evolutionary
biology, genetics/genomics, or a related eld. Inter-
est/experience in developing functional approaches for
non-model organisms is also desirable. Importantly, we
are looking for someone who is personable and enthusi-
astic about working in a collaborative environment.
The preferred start date is Spring or Summer 2016 (ne-
gotiable) and funding is available for 2-3 years. Salary
is commensurate with experience and includes benets.
Interested candidates should submit a cover letter de-
scribing research interests/experience and a full CV with
contact information for three references. Application
materials and all queries should be sent to: cather-
ine.linnen@uky.edu. Review of applications will begin

Title: Postdoctoral position in Cichlid and Pupsh Spe-
ciation Genomics
The Martin Fish Speciation Lab at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeks a postdoc for in-
tegrative studies of the evolutionary ecology of adap-
tive radiation. We are developing two study systems,
Caribbean pupshes and Cameroon crater lake cichlids,
using a suite of evolutionary, ecological, and behav-
ioral approaches. Pupshes present an opportunity to
measure complex tness landscapes underlying the evo-
lution of novel trophic specialists. Cameroon crater
lake cichlids may be one of the best examples of sym-
patric speciation in nature, but more work is needed
to examine whether secondary gene ow has facilitated
their adaptive radiation. The postdoc will have sub-
stantial exibility in pursuing ongoing projects in these
promising systems, mainly focusing on analyses of whole
genome resequencing data, quantitative genetics, or the
genetic architecture of tness landscapes. Alternative
research directions will also be considered.
UNC Chapel Hill supports a vibrant community of evo-
lutionary biologists interested in speciation, both within
the department and the greater Triangle area. The
postdoc will be integrated into departmental activities
and will receive mentoring in professional skills. The
quality of life in this area is consistently rated among
the highest in the nation.Basic qualications:
Ph.D. or equivalent degree in biology, evolution, genetics,
bioinformatics, or related eld. Publications resulting
from dissertation and broad interest in the evolution
and ecology of adaptive radiation.
Preferred qualications:
Demonstrated expertise in any area of speciation ge-
nomics. No pipetting experience necessary as this po-
sition is for downstream data analysis. There will be
opportunities for eldwork or live animal work in the
sh room if desired, but this is not required for the
position.
The position is for 12 months with the possibility of
renewal dependent on performance. Start date is Sum-
mer or Fall 2016. Salary is $40,000 with benets. The
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is an equal
opportunity employer with a strong institutional com-
mitment to inclusiveness and diversity. Applicants from
underrepresented backgrounds are especially encouraged
to apply.
Interested candidates should submit a cover letter de-

Genome organization of AM fungi
Post doc and PhD position in Evolutionary Biology
At the Department of Evolutionary Biology, Uppsala
University, Sweden.
Description
Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbiotic in-
teractions with almost all terrestrial plants and have
done so since plants rst colonized land. The postdocFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 129
and PhD position are both part of a newly funded ERC
research program aimed at understanding the ecology
and evolution of these widespread and important or-
ganisms. Using state-of-the art technology, e.g., PacBio
long read sequencing and single nucleus genomics meth-
ods, the research program seeks to resolve the genome
organization of AM fungi so that the evolutionary con-
sequences of their genome organization can be studied.
Specically, the project aims at testing the hypothe-
sis that genetically distinct nuclear genotypes coexist
within AM fungi. The project involves culturing of AM
fungi, sorting and genotyping of nuclei from individual
fungal isolates, genome and meta-genome sequencing
and assembly[INS: , :INS] as well as genome size estima-
tion. Based on the outcome of this rst part, the project
will be developed to connect genotype and phenotype
to mycorrhizal activity.
The postdoc and PhD student will work close together
and be part of an expanding research team led by Anna
Rosling (http://www.ieg.uu.se/evolutionary-biology/-
rosling/research/) in collaboration with Hanna Jo-
hannesson (http://www.iob.uu.se/research/systematic-

Course Announcement:
Nick Matzke and Dan Warren will be teaching a course
entitled \Model-based Statistical Inference in Ecologi-
cal and Evolutionary Biogeography" in Barcelona from
November 28 to Dec 2, 2016.
This course will cover the theory and practice of widely
used methods in evolutionary and ecological biogeog-
raphy, namely ecological niche modelling / species dis-
tribution modelling, and ancestral range estimation on
phylogenies.
The course will cover both the practical challenges to
using these techniques (the basics of R, obtaining and
processing geographical occurrence data from GBIF,
setting up and using the models), and the assumptions
that various models and methods make.
R packages we will use include rgbif, dismo, ENMTools,
and BioGeoBEARS.
Finally, this course will introduce several new ap-
proaches being developed by the instructors for linking
ecological and evolutionary models.

Lund University, 9-13 May 2016.
Info @: http://www.biology.lu.se/education/-
phd-studies/phd-courses/phenomics -geometric-
morphometrics-using-r Description: The analysis oforganismal shape is central to many questions in
ecology and evolution. This course aims at providing
an introduction to the theory and methods of geometric
morphometrics for analyzing variation in shape and
its covariation with other variables. It will provide an
overview of the theory underlying the quantication
of shape using landmark methods, and a practical
guide to data acquisition, standardization for obtaining
shape variables, statistical treatment of shape variation
and visualization of the results in the R language for
statistical programming.
Content: The course will include both theoretical and
practical sessions. During the theoretical session we
will provide a comprehensive introduction to the meth-
ods of landmark-based geometric morphometrics, which
aims at providing the participants with a solid theoreti-
cal background for understanding the procedures used
in shape data analysis. Practical sessions will include
worked examples of data acquisition, standardization
and statistical analysis, giving the participants the op-
portunity to gain practical experience in the treatment
of shape data using the R package geomorphic and other
statistical routines in R. We will provide an example
dataset, but we encourage the participants to bring their
own data for treatment.

visualizations that allow the user to observe evolution in
action. (See http://avida-ed.msu.edu/for more informa-
tion and to download a copy of the software.)Organisms
within this software (Avidians) are self-replicating com-
puter programs, competing for computational resources
supplied by the environment.Their replication is imper-
fect, resulting in mutations in some of their ospring,
which may alter the ability of those organisms to make
use of their environmental resources.Populations studied
over the course of generations therefore display all of the
elements necessary for evolution by natural selection:
variation, inheritance, selection, and time.Avida-ED
thus provides not a simulation of evolution, but an
actual instance of it.
Avida-ED has been developed for undergraduates and
advanced placement high school students to learn about
the nature of science and evolution in particular.Users
have signicant control of the environment, and are able
to change parameters such as the world size, the muta-
tion rate, and what resources are available.Individual
organisms can be saved in a virtual freezer, analyzed
individually to watch how they perform tasks and repli-
cate themselves, and used to start new evolutionary
runs.Because digital organisms grow and divide much
faster than even the fastest microbes, Avida-ED allows
users to test evolutionary hypotheses over the course of
hours or minutes.By generating hypotheses, collecting
data, and analyzing results, users gain experience not
just with concepts in evolution, but with the nature and
practice of science as a whole.
Workshop participants will join a growing community
of educators using digital evolution to let their stu-
dents directly observe evolutionary processes through
inquiry-based exercises that advance reform-oriented ac-
tive learning.Participants will develop new lesson plans
and will help collect assessment data from their class-
room implementations.They will help disseminate mate-
rials and train other science educators; nancial support
is available for this.At least one member of each pair
will attend a 1-day follow up meeting at MSU in earlysummer 2017 to report on their experience.

The 2nd annual Avida-ED Active LENS Workshop will
be held at Michigan State University June 9-11, 2016
in East Lansing, MI. The purpose of this workshop is
to train instructors in the use of the Avida-ED soft-
ware package, developed to help students learn about
evolution and the nature of science, so that workshop
participants can both implement classroom interven-
tions using this software and also train other educators.
Teams of two will learn to use Avida-ED and how to
best incorporate it into courses that they teach. Travel
and expenses related to the workshop will be covered for
the 20 workshop participants as part of an NSF-funded
IUSE grant.
Avida is a digital evolution software platform used to
study evolutionary processes, and harness evolution to
solve engineering problems. Avida-ED is a free, user-

INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR BIOLOGISTS
REPEAT COURSE!!
This course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones,
an expert in Python and author of two text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners
/dp/1492346136/] Advanced Python for Biologists140 EvolDir February 1, 2016
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/14952 44377/].
Due to high demand a repeat of this course will run
from 23rd - 27th May 2016 at SCENE (the Scottish
Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment), Loch
Lomond National Park, Glasgow.
Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable lan-
guage that is a popular platform for all types of bioin-
formatics work, from simple one-o scripts to large,
complex software projects. This workshop is aimed at
complete beginners and assumes no prior programming
experience. It gives an overview of the language with an
emphasis on practical problem-solving, using examples
and exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinfor-
matics work. After completing the workshop, students
should be in a position to (1) apply the skills they have
learned to tackle problems in their own research and (2)
continue their Python education in a self-directed way.
Intended audience: This workshop is aimed at all re-
searchers and technical workers with a background in
biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus
has been planned with complete beginners in mind; peo-
ple with previous programming experience are welcome
to attend as a refresher but may nd the pace a bit
slow.
Teaching format: The workshop is delivered over ten
half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organizer's discretion. There will also be plenty
of time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum: Day 1: Module 1 - Introduction Module 2
- Output and text manipulation Day 2: Module 3 - File
IO and user interfaces Module 4 - Flow control 1: loops
Day 3: Module 5 - Flow control 2: conditionals Module
6 - Organizing and structuring code Day 4: Module 7
- Regular expressions Module 8 - Dictionaries Day 5:
Module 9 - Interaction with the le system Module 10 -
Optional free afternoon to cover previous modules and

Application deadline: 14 February
Dear Colleagues
The 2016 edition of the Evolutionary Biology Workshop
in the Alps will take place on 21-27June 2016 in Arolla,
Switzerland.
Target participants are PhD students in early stages of
PhD and advanced Master students - please pass the
info to potential participants.
The main goals of this annual workshop, based on a con-
cept developed by Stephen Stearns and John Maynard
Smith, are to develop the following skills: - developing
your scientic ideas through discussions in groups; -
thinking critically and expressing oneself clearly; - turn-
ing a general idea into a research project; - writing a
research proposal and defending it.
Faculty: William Rice (University of California
Santa Barbara) Dolph Schluter (University of British
Columbia) Tanja Schwander (University of Lausanne)
John Pannell (University of Lausanne) Tad Kawecki
(University of Lausanne)February 1, 2016 EvolDir 141
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back
seat. Additionally, the faculty will give talks about their
research and be available for informal discussion with
individual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in the 100-year old ho-
tel Kurhaus http://www.hotel-kurhaus.arolla.com/, lo-
cated in a small alpine village at an altitude of 2000 m,
which will help you to concentrate on the course while
giving you also the chance to enjoy the views, small
hikes, marmots and the alpine ora.
Fee: CHF 450.- (this covers part of the cost for room
and board, the rest being subsidized by the Herbette
Foundation).
Participants will receive a course certicate for 3 ETCS
credits.

EnGen DESCRIPTION This training opportunity is the
third European/UK installment of a successful annual
course originating from Mount Desert Island Biological
Laboratory. The curriculum is expanded to highlight a
multi-omics (system biology) approach to research in en-
vironmental sciences. It trains PhD students and early
career postdoctoral scientists to investigate how gene
function and metabolism are inuenced by environmen-
tal conditions while accounting for variation that exists
within and among natural populations. The course is
built on the paradigm that this multidisciplinary re-
search eld encompassing ecology, evolution, toxicology,
biostatistics and informatics will most eectively grow
by training early career environmental scientists to prop-
erly design comprehensive, large-scale, Next Generation
Sequencing and Metabolomics experiments enabled by
drastically increased sample-throughput and lower costs.
Most importantly, the challenges of manipulating and
analysing population-level omics (big) data must be
addressed.
The course provides a signicant introduction and much
hands-on training experience so that participants can
initiate their own environmental omics study and net-
work with others in the eld to launch Environmental
Scientist careers in academia and industry. Case studies
using multi-omics data sets collected at the University of
Birmingham will be provided so that you can gain prac-
tical experience of analysing and integrating multi-omics
data.
Course Details The course will include ~1.5 days of142 EvolDir February 1, 2016
generic environmental omics training and ~3.5 days of
specialised genomics or metabolomics training (parallel
tracks).
The combined sessions will include: * Overviews of
environmental genomics and metabolomics * Practi-
cal experience of analysing and integrating multi-omics
data * Synthesis sessions to obtaining grant funding *
Question and answer sessions with a panel of experts
The genomics track includes: * Library construction
methods and QC * Introduction to automation sys-
tems and sequence data workow * Software solutions
for sequence workows and their application in envi-
ronmental research * RNA-seq alignment * Statistical
considerations for analysing genome-scale data * Prac-
tical experience in applying open-source analysis tools
to visualise complex sequence data and explore genome
sequence variation, analyse Tuxedo output and perform
gene set enrichment analysis * Synthesis sessions to ex-
plore using the most appropriate model organism and
maximising outputs from your sequence data
The metabolomics track includes: * Experimental design
* Quality assurance and quality control in metabolomics
* Hands-on sample preparation * Analytical technologies
including mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy *
Data processing, including LC-MS and SIMS stitching
procedures * Univariate and multivariate data analysis
approaches * Metabolite identication
Evening Lecture Series Distinguished visiting academics
will provide keynote lectures on each day of the course
to highlight environmental omic applications that draw
on the expertise of our guest faculty.
Daphnia is used for training because of its growing use
as a model system in the environmental sciences and for
improving environmental health protection, yet the skills
learned during the course will be applicable to all study
systems with maturing genomics and metabolomics re-
sources.

UCLA/La Kretz Workshop in Conservation Genomics,
20-24 March, 2016
Conservation biology, genetics, and evolutionary biol-
ogy have had a long and intimate relationship, and
conservation constitutes one of the key applications of
evolutionary analysis to real-world biological problems.
The impacts of population and landscape genetics and
gene expression studies have been particularly strik-
ing, and are helping to solve some of the most pressing
problems in biological conservation.
As the eld of conservation genetics continues to grow
and mature, the availability of genome-scale data stand
to make profound new contributions to our ability to
identify and protect at-risk populations and recover
those that are most endangered. However, genomic
analyses also carry a heavy burden ^AXdata sets are enor-
mous, often requiring diverse computational approaches
for assembly, quality control and analysis.
The La Kretz annual workshop provides a comfort-
able, rigorous, but informal training environment for a
small group of motivated graduate students to explore
how conservation problems can best be addressed with
genomic-level data. Our goal is to provide hands-on
experience in the ecient collection, troubleshooting,
and analysis of large data sets for conservation-relevant
problems. One of the highlights of our workshop is
active participation from members of several govern-
mental agencies who are at the forefront of endangered
species protection and management, providing a forum
for exploring the most relevant aspects of conservation
genomics to managers.
The UCLA/La Kretz workshop is held at the La Kretz
Field Station (http://www.environment.ucla.edu/-
lakretz/eldstation/) and Stunt Ranch Reserve
(http://stuntranch.ucnrs.org) in the heart of the
Santa Monica Mountains. Only 30 miles from UCLA
and the LAX airport, but nestled in the relatively
undeveloped 160,000 acre Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area, the Field Station/Stunt
Reserve provides an ideal location to explore newFebruary 1, 2016 EvolDir 143
developments in genomic science and pressing needs
in conservation and management together in a single
setting.

who have some familiarity with using a command line
interface or programming languages (i.e. Perl, python
etc.). Postdocs, faculty, and government researchers
may also apply, but preference will be given to gradu-
ate students. We encourage applications from women,
minorities, and individuals from under-represented de-
mographics in the sciences.
Admission and Fees
Applicants will be admitted based on academic quali-
cations and appropriateness of research interests. The
course fee is $425. This includes food and lodging at the
La Kretz Field Station, as well as any incidental fees,
for the duration of the course (arriving Sunday March

YosemiteNatlPark Symbiosis
May6-8
Dear Colleagues,
The Sixth annual Symbiosis Workshop will take place
on May 6th-8th, 2016 at the Sierra Nevada ResearchStation, Yosemite National Park. This has become a
great venue for a diversity of symbiosis researchers, so
we hope to continue to attract a diverse group:
Keynote speaker 2016: Dr. Betsy Arnold from the
University of Arizona.
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our goal is to better integrate scientists that fo-
cus on symbiosis research. We plan to continue annual
workshops at Yosemite as this site is both beautiful and
secluded. This will be our 6th annual meeting and we
have been attracting scientists from all over the country
and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in both
cooperation and symbiosis. In the past we have covered
a range of symbiosis topics from ecology and evolution
to molecular mechanisms in dierent model and non-
model systems. We would like to make room for a
diverse group of people so we will initially accept up to
3 lab members per group (including the PI) on a rst
come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held May 7-
8, 2016, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 6th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting. Abstract and early
bird registration are due on February 15, 2016.
Where: SNRS has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room. Costs: See
details in the registration page. We will only be able to
accept credit card payments this year.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
