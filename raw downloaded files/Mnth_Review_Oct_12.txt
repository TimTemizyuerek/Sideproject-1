EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY AND THE MANAGE-
MENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS
22 - 23 November 2012 at the Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) in Duben-
dorf, Switzerland
Evolutionary and ecological processes occur over similar
timescales and aect the emergence, maintenance, and
change of biological diversity. The potential for rapid
evolutionary processes can also aect a broad range of
applied issues, such as the eects of invasive species, the
conservation of threatened species, the management of
aquatic pathogens or ecosystem services. We will dis-
cuss how approaches from evolutionary ecology can con-
tribute to solving environmental problems in aquatic
ecosystems. This is a science-stakeholder interaction
symposium that aims to foster collaboration between
researchers and practitioners. It comprises talks by in-
vited speakers, contributed talks, podium discussions
and a poster session.

After the success of the 2011 G ottingen mini sympo-
sium on evolutionary biology, the GOEvol organization
team is pleased to announce that the date of the next
mini symposium/workshop has been set to Tuesday,
October2nd 2012 at the Max-Planck-Institute for Dy-
namics and Self-Organization (MPIDS, Bunsenstrasse
10, Lecture Hall in House 8). In continuation with
the spirit of the GOEvol network, this meeting aims
to foster interactions within the diverse and dynamic
G ottingen community of evolutionary biologists. The
intention of this meeting is to create an interaction plat-
form for scientists working on evolutionary biology in
G ottingen. The meeting is open to everyone wanting
to present and discuss his/her ideas. Of course visitors
and scientists from other universities are also warmly
welcome to participate.
The last meeting allowed us to get a rst overview of
the projects going on in G ottingen. In order to cover
the broad spectrum of scientic topics investigated, this
year we want to change the structure. In the morn-
ing we will have ve talks by invited speakers, which
might be of interest to a greater audience. During the
(extended) lunch break we will have a poster session.
Here, we especially encourage master and PhD students
to present their projects. In the afternoon the focus
will beset on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Af-
ter an introduction, the resources available in G ottingen
will be presented, followed by short talks on ongoing
projects dealing with NGS.

PathogenEvolutionaryGenomics
PhD position in evolutionary genomics of pathogens at
the ETH Zurich / Switzerland
Modern agriculture relies on eective control of
pathogens. The continent-scale homogenisation of crop
varieties and the heavy reliance on a small set of fungi-
cides has greatly increased risks to global food security.
The speed of pathogen adaptation to new crop vari-
eties is directly related to the extent of mono-cultures.
The genomic revolution fundamentally altered the eld
of pathogen research. The establishment of reference
genome sequences for a large number of pathogenic
fungi and bacteria provided extensive catalogues of the
genomic and functional characteristics of pathogens.
The comparison of dierent pathogen genomes revealed
similar strategies for host exploitation. However, the
evolutionary history of eectors or host specic toxins
remains largely obscured by the fact that these genes
seem to arise rapidly and share little sequence similar-
ity.
The next phase in the genomic revolution will be the14 EvolDir October 1, 2012
sequencing of very large numbers of isolates within
one species. Mycosphaerella graminicola (synonym Zy-
moseptoria tritici) is a major pathogen of wheat that
incurs up to 30% yield loss during outbreaks and has a
well documented evolutionary history. The pathogen
emerged from wild progenitor species found on wild
grasses in the Fertile Crescent. M. graminicola car-
ries an extensive set of accessory chromosomes (chromo-
somes not found in all members of a species). Accessory
chromosomes likely provide a cradle for adaptive evo-
lution in pathogens. Despite the high-quality genomic
resources, very few genes involved in host virulence and
climate adaptation are known.
We aim to identify the various selective pressures that
acted on the genome by analyzing 120 genomes from
four dierent populations covering the geographic range
and the phenotypic diversity of the species. We will
use genome-scale comparisons to document fundamen-
tal mechanisms shaping the evolution of gene and chro-
mosomal structure. This project will be at the interface
of genome and evolutionary biology, as well as agricul-
tural sciences.
This project is best suited for a biologist (MSc or Hon-
ors BSc) with a strong interest both in evolutionary
biology and the analysis of genomic sequences. Expe-
rience in bioinformatics, statistics (e.g. R) and/or pro-
gramming is a plus but not a requirement. A strong
motivation to learn these techniques and a willingness
to work in a team will be important.
You will be supervised jointly by Dr. Daniel Croll and
Prof. Bruce McDonald at the Institute for Integra-
tive Biology at the ETH Zurich. You will have access
to a state of the art user laboratory (Genetic Diver-
sity Centre), next-generation sequencing center (at the
D-BSSE) and high-performance computing resources
(BRUTUS). The workplace is located in the center of
Zurich and provides a wealth of opportunities to inter-
act with other students.

research combines molecular, morphological and fos-
sil evidence to gain insights into evolutionary rela-
tionships (phylogeny), biogeography, biodiversity, ecol-
ogy, origins and diversication of crabs, lobsters and
shrimp. As part of this research, we have been devel-
oping and applying novel methods for DNA sequenc-
ing using next-generation technology and directed se-
quencing. More recently, we have been exploring vi-
sual systems and structures involved in marine biolu-
minescence using deep-sea shrimp as model organisms.
Present awarded grants propose to study the eects of
the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill on the Gulf of Mex-
ico coastal and deep bank ecosystems. We are using
gene expression studies and transcriptomics to assess
the stress response of nearshore decapod crustaceans
to increased oil exposure.
Qualications
Applicants should have a background in evolutionary
biology and molecular methods. Experience with inver-
tebrate zoology, phylogenetics, systematics, next gen-
eration sequencing methods and/or bioinformatics is a

The project will assess how the eects of extreme
weather events can act as pressures threatening bio-
diversity, resilience and ecosystem services of semi-
natural grasslands and can suddenly drive them be-
yond thresholds of system integrity. Plant diversity
itself may buer against these pressures. Potential
stabilizing mechanisms include species richness, pres-
ence of key species such as legumes. These poten-
tial buers can be promoted by conservation manage-
ment and political decisions. The frequency and magni-16 EvolDir October 1, 2012
tude of extreme climatic events are expected to increase
with ongoing climate change. Their eects on biodiver-
sity and ecosystem functioning can be severe, e.g. re-
duced productivity or altered successional trajectories
of species compositions in response to extreme drought.
However, other studies nd surprisingly high resilience
of several ecosystem functions in the face of extreme
drought. Yet, it is suggested that more extreme rainfall
regimes will negatively aect mesic ecosystems, while
xeric ecosystems might even benet.
Grasslands provide the domestic herbivores diet in
quantity and quality. A decline in production, linked to
more severe stress, could be accompanied by a decline
in forage quality, due to a change in species compo-
sition, structure herbaceous cover and / or the nutri-
tional status of plants. Climate scenarios developed in
the last IPCC report forecast an increase in the number
of days without precipitation. Under these conditions,
it is important to assess the ability of plants of upland
grassland to resist and recover from more frequent and
intense stress.
PhD student will study the resistance and recovery
of perennial grassland in response to water stress, for
which the seasonality of occurrence will be taken into
account. This will be discussed at the plant commu-
nity and the functional groups levels in a eld experi-
ment and in mixtures of grasses associated with legume
species in semi-controlled conditions.

background in plant ecology, or plant ecophysiology.

We are seeking one motivated master student (MsC
internship or equivalent) interested in taking part in
laboratory studies at the Max Planck Institute in
Seewiesen, Germany. Applicants will complete his/her
thesis being part of the behavioral neurobiology group,
department Gahr. http://orn.iwww.mpg.de/2542/-
Department Gahr Supervisor: Dr. Andries ter Maat
Tutor: Pietro D'Amelio
The project aims to clarify whether Zebra Finches are
able to recognize the unlearned contact calls by vo-
cal clues and whether these calls are necessary for pair
bonding maintenance.
Project description:
The Zebra Finches are one of the commonest study
model for research on vocal communication, mainly re-
garding song learning and production. However dy-
namics of call production and messages delivered still
remain to be unraveled. Our group aims to nd out
why and how calls are elicited within a social network.
The relationships within pairs represent an especiallysalient aspect of the social system of Zebra Finches, a
socially monogamous species with long term pairing.
By employing behavioural analysis and correlating the
call production of dierent individuals we want to in-
vestigate whether the dierent call types are important
for pair bond maintenance and for advertising this to
all the other members of the group.
Using techniques developed in our group, the student
has to design experiments aiming to answer 2 questions:
a) Are Zebra Finches able to discern their mate's un-
learned contact calls on the basis of their acoustic fea-
tures?
b) Is calls production necessary for pair bond continu-
ity?
Students are encouraged to develop their own exper-
imental setting within the framework of the research
program.
Main Material and Methods:
-Use of micro-cameras and backpack wireless micro-
phones.
-Video analysis (software: Observer 10.5)
-Audio analysis
-Use of statistical software (R)

our understanding of natural variation, adaptation to
contrasting habitats, as well as comparative genomics
and sex chromosome evolution.
To be able to order and to verify the assembled genome,
ne-scale genetic maps are a useful tool. We con-

at Rennes University, France
Population Genetics and Evolution of partial asexual-
ity: Inferring and modelling the impacts of partial asex-
uality on population genomics
*Assumptions and questioning*
*~~~~~
The PhD student will tackle what are the quantitative
eects of partial asexuality on the expected genetic/-
omic diversity and its structure in metapopulations
when those ones undergo selective pressures and, Do
the joint eects of the evolutionary forces and partial
asexuality result in distinctive genomic patterns from
which biologists may infer the current and past evolu-
tion of such species.
The PhD student will answer by completing a popula-
tion genetics model dedicated to partially asexual or-
ganisms to take into account for selective processes and
by analysing a wide range of datasets and simulations
results. The mathematical model will allow to study
the evolutionary specicities and the genomic patterns
left by of such functioning, and to propose some infer-
ence methods. The model we use without selection has
already shown that evolution of the genetic diversity
of partially asexual species diverges the ones expected20 EvolDir October 1, 2012
from pure sexual and asexual species.
*The main prospective steps of the thesis*
*~~~~~
The work will consist in extending a mathematical
model by formalizing the selective processes applied on
genotypes. The model will become automated in op-
timized computation algorithms (in collaboration with
the Symbiosis team, IRISA, Rennes). The model out-
puts will be analyzed and confronted to simulation re-
sults, biological knowledge and experimental data (al-
ready acquiered in a wide range of organisms), the four
other partners of the ANR (the collaborative grant that
fund the PhD expenses) and a scientic network. The
PhD student will explore the trends of his/her quanti-
tative predictions, identify the specic eects of partial
asexuality on population genetics indices under selec-
tion and participate in providing new descriptive in-
dices adapted to such species (in collaboration with
S.Arnaud-Haond, Ifremer, Montpellier). She/He will
participate in the development of quantitative inference
methods to identify forces and eective rates of asexu-
ality under which genomes have evolved. Finally, the
PhD student will reinterpret the historical signicance
of asexuality in the evolutionary histories of varied or-
ganisms.
/Methodological and technical approaches considered/
-Running and developing mathematical population ge-
netics models (Markov chain, dierential equation, dif-

Description of the project: Melastomataceae (Princess
Flowers) are one of the largest families of plants, form-
ing prevalent components of many tropical biodiver-
sity hotspots. They serve as a major food source for
bees and seed dispersers such as birds and mammals,
and play a critical successional role in the regenera-
tion of disturbed forests. Through a combination of
eld work in targeted countries, molecular phylogenetic
techniques, and scanning electron microscopy, the in-
vestigators aim to improve the classication of Melas-
tomataceae, develop means to easily identify its ma-
jor groupings (genera and tribes), track how diagnostic
characters in the family have evolved, test ideas on how
pollination systems have evolved in tropical ecosystems,
evaluate models of ancient climate change, and provide
new data to inform and direct conservation priorities.
Tasks for M.Sc. student: Execute scientic research as
detailed in the project description; scanning electron
microscopy and descriptions of seeds; DNA sequencing;
eldwork in southeast Asia; gathering and analyzing
data leading to a successful thesis defense within two
years; completion of required graduate credits at SFSU
while maintaining at least a 3.0 GPA.
Requirements: B.S. degree in Biology or very closely
related discipline with a minimum 3.0 GPA; courses
in botany, plant systematics, molecular biology, evo-
lution, or equivalent; highly procient in both written
and spoken English (must have high scores in TOEFL
and GRE exams). Ability to work eciently, inde-
pendently as well as in collaboration, and high mo-
tivation will be assets. Experience with eldwork in
Southeast Asia, participation in scientic investiga-
tions, and uency in a Southeast Asian language(s) is
strongly preferred. Additional university application
requirements will also need to be fullled (see http://-
biology.sfsu.edu/programs/graduate).

UCambridge Speciation Behavioural
Genetics
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to in-
vestigate buttery speciation in the tropics. The stu-
dent will focus on the behavioural genetics of reproduc-
tive isolation in the parapatric species H. erato and H.
himera. These two species share a narrow but strongly
bimodal hybrid zone in southern Ecuador. Despite ge-
netic dierentiation there is no evidence of hybrid steril-
ity/inviability and speciation appears to have been cat-
alyzed by the association of strong mating preferences
with divergence in warning coloration and ecology (see
below for some relevant publications).The project would suit someone keen to combine eld-
work and behavioural experiments in the tropics with
molecular lab work. The focus of the project would
be to map the genetic basis of mate preferences shifts
between H. erato and H. himeera, and would involve
spending considerable time at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Panama, but could additionally
involve additional eld, lab or insectary experiments
depending on the candidate's interests.
The student will be co-supervised by Dr Richard Mer-
rill and Dr Chris Jiggins at the University of Cambridge
(http://heliconius.zoo.cam.ac.uk/), as well as Dr Owen
McMillan at STRI (http://www.stri.si.edu/english/-
scientic sta/sta scientist/scientist.php?id=62). As
such, he/she will join a highly active international com-
munity of researchers studying the genetics of specia-
tion and adaptation in Heliconius.
Please note that this is not a funded post. In-
terested applicants will be supported in their
application for funding at Cambridge. The fund-
ing deadline for US applicants is 16 October, so
potential applicants from the US should get in

Vacancy for a joint Phd position at University Ghent
and University of Groningen on eco-evolutionary dy-
namics in a spatial context.
According to classical island biogeography by
MacArthur and Wilson (1967), immigration, spe-
ciation and extinction determine species diversity.
However, diversity is not only an outcome of ecologicalOctober 1, 2012 EvolDir 25

them. Thus eco-evolutionary dynamics are expected
to determine macroecological and macroevolutionary
patterns such as foodweb structure and phylogenetic
relatedness.
Within a joint doctoral program between the Univer-
sity of Ghent, Belgium and the University of Gronin-
gen, The Netherlands, we have an open PhD va-

ics. Your work will combine theoretical (analytical and
simulation models) and experimental (mesocosms) ap-
proaches. You will be supervised by Prof. dr. R.S.
Etienne (Groningen) and Prof. dr. D. Bonte (Ghent).
Description:
. You will prepare a doctoral thesis in the eld of eco-
evolutionary dynamics

PhD position in Animal Ecology (1,0 fte) University of
Groningen
The Animal Ecology group has an opening for a PhD
position for a highly motivated eld ecologist with evo-
lutionary interests for a four-year PhD project. The
ideal candidate is fascinated by evolutionary and eco-
logical questions, is a keen eld biologist, independent
and creative. Working experience with birds is an ad-
vantage. A MSc (or equivalent) in Biology/Ecology is
required.
Background Environments change at an unprecedented
rate, challenging the adaptive potential of living or-
ganisms. Species that cannot adapt to such fast en-
vironmental changes will suer, and may even go ex-
tinct. Relatively little is known about adaptation of
species to directional environmental changes: How ex-
ible are species and what are their constraints? The
advertised PhD position will focus on the possibilities
and constraints regarding adaptation to ongoing cli-
mate change, using migratory birds as model species.
Research of the Animal Ecology Group of the last
decade has shown that a small migratory passerine,
the pied ycatcher, has diculties to adapt to climate
change. Flycatchers breed in seasonal forests that are
often characterized by a short peak in insect abundance
in spring. Reproductive success is high when the chicks
grow up during this period of peak abundance. Re-
cent increases in spring temperature have advanced this
food peak to a greater extent than the ycatcher breed-
ing time, creating a temporal mismatch between the
birds and their food. This insucient adaptation was
shown to lead to population declines in this, and other
long-distance migrants. A possible reason why birds
have diculty to adjust is that at their African winter-
ing grounds the birds cannot directly sense advances in
spring at their European breeding sites. A recent excit-
ing development is that birds slowly seem to adapt to
the new situation. Possibly we witness the rst signs of
evolutionary changes by which pied ycatchers adapt
to climate change.
We are interested in dierent aspects of adaptation on
the species level, but also in possible community con-
sequences of climate change. Possible lines of research
are: (1) dispersal of locally maladapted individuals to
more northern sites, (2) genetic variation and pheno-26 EvolDir October 1, 2012
typic plasticity of annual cycles and selection, (3) carry-
over eects of wintering locations and migration on re-
productive success, (4) community eects of increased
mismatches in forest ecosystems.
Within the theme \adaptation to climate change" in
the pied ycatcher system we oer the candidate time
and space to develop his/her own ideas. After the ini-
tial selection, we ask the candidates to come up with a
brief research plan on their preferred research line as a
starting point to develop their career in ecology.
Research group: The PhD will work in the Animal
Ecology research group which is part of the research
institute CEES (Center for Ecological and Evolution-
ary Studies) of Groningen University. Christiaan Both
and Joost Tinbergen will supervise the project.
Candidates must have a degree in biology, with spe-
cialisation in ecology. We are looking for an enthusiast
researcher with ample experience in eld research on
birds. Theoretical interest in evolutionary ecological
research is a prerequisite.
Preferred starting date is 1 January 2013.
Application: Successful applications include a letter
containing your motivation for applying for this posi-
tion and a description of previous relevant research ex-
perience, a full curriculum vitae and the vacancy num-
ber. Applications that are incomplete or are otherwise
faulty will not be taken into account. Interviews will be

AlternativePhenotypesAnts
A fully-funded PhD position is available at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Lau-
sanne, to work on maternal and genetic eects on queen
and worker determination in ants.
Reproductive division of labor between queens and
workers is at the root of the tremendous ecological suc-
cess of social insects, yet the developmental pathways
underlying these alternative phenotypes and the tra-
jectories that led to their evolution remain speculative.
Several recent studies revealed that maternal and/or
genetic eects have an important role in queen and
worker caste determination in some species. The aim of
this PhD project is to develop insights into the mecha-
nisms mediating these eects, taking advantage of next
generation sequencing tools, molecular genetics and the
recently published ant genomes.
The project will be hosted by the Keller lab (http:/-
/www.unil.ch/dee/page6763.html), and co-advised by
Laurent Keller and Tanja Schwander. Candidates
should have a master degree in an appropriate discipline
and a keen interest in evolutionary biology. The po-
sition requires an independent, highly motivated, andOctober 1, 2012 EvolDir 27
scientically curious individual with strong interests in
the above described central topic. All our projects are
highly integrative and require willingness to closely col-
laborate with researchers of dierent backgrounds.
The Department of Ecology and Evolution in Lau-
sanne provides a stimulating research environment,
with an active program of seminars and discussion
groups (in English); see http://www.unil.ch/dee/ .Lau-
sanne is located in the French part of Switzerland,

UQueensland EvolutionaryGenetics
The newly established evolutionary genetics group of
Jan Engelst adter at The University of Queensland
(Brisbane, Australia) invites applications for PhD posi-
tions. We are interested in the evolutionary biology of
sexual processes, parasitism, and the various interplays
between these two phenomena. Our main approach is
to develop mathematical models and conduct computer
simulations, but projects involving eld and lab work
are also possible. Potential PhD topics include, but are
not limited to the following:
- Evolution of antibiotic resistance and recombination
in bacteria - Wolbachia and other reproductive para-
sites of arthropods - Sex chromosome evolution - Host-
parasite co-evolution
We are looking for motivated students with a strong
background in either evolutionary biology, mathemat-
ical modeling, or molecular microbiology. Candidates
with a non-biology degree (mathematics, physics, com-
puter science) are especially encouraged to apply, but
are expected to have some basic knowledge of biology.
Good communication skills, scientic curiosity and en-

UZurich 2 BrainEvolution
Two PhD positions - University of Zurich
Energetic aspects of brain size evolution
Two three-year PhD positions are available at the
Anthropological Institute and Museum (University of
Z urich) to work on a broad comparative study of the
energetic aspects of brain size evolution. The project
^ aEnergetic aspects of brain size evolution: Cognitive vs.
physiological strategies for survival\ is funded by the
Swiss National Science Foundation. We have shown re-
cently that, to allow an increase in brain size, either to-
tal energy metabolism must be increased, or the organ-
ism reduces energy allocation to other functions such
as production or locomotion (but not digestion). In
the current project, we will investigate links between
ecology, lifestyle, and brain size in a broad sample of
mammals. Ultimately, the results of this project will
enhance our understanding of the hominin evolution-
ary history.
One PhD project will focus on behavioral exibility in
dealing with periods of food scarcity (cognitive buer-
ing) in mammals (i.e. by stabilizing energy input). The
other PhD project will focus on physiological adapta-
tions to buer energy shortages during lean or cold
periods, (i.e. by reducing energy expenditure). You
will collect data in museums and zoos, compile datafrom the literature, and test various predictions using
^ aphylogenetically informed\ statistical methods.
You will be working in an international, multidisci-
plinary team of primatologists and paleoanthropolo-
gists at one of Europe's leading institutions in this eld.
Salary is according to the regulations of the Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation.
Applicants should excel in both practical and academic
skills, have a Master's degree in biology (e.g. zoology,
physical anthropology, evolutionary or computational
biology), and be uent in English. Advanced skills in
statistical data analysis and, for the second project, pre-
vious experience with dissections are required.
Candidates should send a letter of application, a cur-
riculum vitae, a transcript of study records, contact
information for two academic referees, and a half-page
summary of the Master's thesis (all combined to a sin-
gle PDF) to Karin Isler at kisler@aim.uzh.ch no later

UZurich AvianFamilyEvolution
MSc student position in Biology, University of Zurich,
Switzerland.
One MSc position is available in the lab of Michael
Griesser to study the evolution of family living in birds.
We seek an enthusiastic graduate student with a strong
interest in evolutionary biology and behavioural ecol-
ogy. The candidate should have previous experience
from experimental eldwork, preferably with birds.
The selected candidate is expected to join us in the
eld in October 2012.
The candidate, with help of eld experiments, will in-
vestigate family dynamics in black wheatears (Oenan-
the leucura) in southern Spain. In this species, o-
spring of second broods remain with their parents untilOctober 1, 2012 EvolDir 31
the onset of the breeding season the year thereafter.
Field experiments in other species have suggested that
ospring remain with their parents due to nepotistic
benets which arise from staying with the parents, and
thus ospring remain only as long as their family is in-
tact. We will use eld experiments to investigate the
role of changes in family dynamics for the decision of
ospring to remain in their natal group.
The project will require eldwork during au-
tumn/winter 2012 and 2013. The candidate is expected
to perform the eld work (after initial help) indepen-
dently. Thus, previous experience with avian research
in the eld, behavioural observations, and bird han-
dling are valuable. A drivers license is required for this
project. Basic knowledge of Spanish is an advantage.
The candidate will be supervised by Gretchen Wagner
and Michael Griesser.
Our research group is part of the Anthropological In-
stitute at the University of Zurich (www.aim.uzh.ch/-
index.html), where several research groups work on the
evolution of social dynamics and cooperative breeding
in primates. The working language at the institute is
English.
MSc studies at the University of Zurich take 2 years,
and cover both degree project work and courses.

UZurich HostParasiteEvolGen
PhD Position in Evolutionary Genetics of Wildlife Dis-
ease University of Zurich, Switzerland
A 3-year PhD position is available in Barbara
Tschirren's group at the University of Zurich, Switzer-
land, to work on the genetic basis of Borrelia resistance
in natural rodent populations.
Lyme borreliosis is the most important zoonotic dis-32 EvolDir October 1, 2012
ease in Europe and North America, having major de-
bilitating eects in humans. It is caused by the spiro-
chete Borrelia sp., which is transmitted by ticks of the
Ixodes ricinus complex to animal hosts, in particular
small rodents. Natural hosts are commonly and heav-
ily infested with ticks throughout their life, and thus
encounter Borrelia on a regular basis. Yet, only about
20-30% of animals become Borrelia infected, demon-
strating that natural hosts have evolved powerful de-
fence mechanisms, which prevent and / or control Bor-
relia infection. To date, this variation in Borrelia resis-
tance remains poorly understood, which hampers fur-
ther progress in the management of this emerging pub-
lic health risk, as well as our understanding of coevolu-
tionary processes in host-Borrelia systems.
In this PhD project, as part of the University Research
Priority Program -Evolution in Action', we will com-
bine ecological research in natural rodent populations
with molecular work in the laboratory to obtain com-
prehensive insights into the genetic and regulatory basis
of variation in resistance to Borrelia in the wild.
Sequencing of candidate regions in animals from pop-
ulations, which dier in Borrelia prevalence (along al-
titudinal gradients in the Swiss Alps) will allow us to
investigate the role of parasites in population dieren-
tiation. Due to climate change, Borrelia now occurs in
Switzerland at altitudes that were previously Borrelia-
free. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate
changes in the genetic composition of host populations
that have no coevolutionary history with Borrelia, pro-
viding a powerful model to study rapid evolutionary
changes in response to emerging pathogens.
The ideal candidate for this project is fascinated by
evolutionary questions, highly motivated, independent
and creative, and has a strong interest to combine work
in the eld with molecular analyses in the lab. She /
he has a background in evolutionary ecology or molecu-
lar ecology (or a related eld) and some lab experience.
The project requires substantial amount of eldwork
under sometimes dicult conditions (terrain, weather)
for several weeks in the Swiss Alps. A driver's license
is required.
The successful applicant will be based at the Institute
of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of
the University of Zurich, providing ample opportuni-
ties for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary elds (http://-
www.ieu.uzh.ch). The research groups are very inter-
national and the working language is English.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlining
your motivation to work on this project as well as your
relevant experience, 2) a detailed curriculum vitae, 3)copies of academic qualications, 4) the contact details
of two academic referees, and 5) a 1/2-page description
of your MSc project. Send the above as a single .pdf

tomic adaptation to ocean acidication
a major goal in our group is to seek the genetic basis
of rapid adaptation /coevolutionary processes using a
combination of selection experiments and eld observa-
tions across contrasting habitats. One mid-term goal
is to make predictions on the adaptability of species
/populations based on their genomic architecture and

melanogaster populations and maintain various exper-
imental evolution cages), research at the institute also
includes Arabidopsis, camels, cheetahs and lemurs.
The successful candidate will have a record of high qual-
ity research in population genetics, preferably with a
proven ability to attract extramural funding. While we
welcome applications from experimentalists as well as
theoreticians, we expect that the future post holder will
actively enhance our visibility in Drosophila population
genetics.

D pseudoobscura stock
Dear Drosophilists,
I am looking for a healthy, lab-adapted and outbred
stock of Drosophila pseudoobscura, preferably one that
is adapted to a relatively simple food recipe (e.g., not
requiring fresh bananas). I realize that the stock cen-
ter may be one source, I would be very interested in a
stock in current and successful use in a lab, and with a
known history.
I am actually looking for healthy, outbred and lab-adapted stocks of both Drosophila pseudoobscura AND
D. persimilis. I would be delighted to hear from anyone
that might be willing to share either or both of these.
Much appreciated, Howard

Phylogeny MorphologicalData
Software answers
Hello all,
About a month ago, I made post seeking advice for
free software for phylogenetic analysis of morphological
data by undergraduate students and pasted below are
the responses I received. Thank you all very much for
your helpful suggestions.
Response #1
You can try out Mesquite or Mcclade; or also Brownie
2.1October 1, 2012 EvolDir 77
Response #2
Try TNT: http://www.zmuc.dk/public/phylogeny/-
TNT/ It's also very quick.
Response #3
It is a deeply nontrivial matter, owing to most methods
failing to correct for covariation between the characters.
But anyway they should look at the list at my \Phy-
logeny Programs" listing (Google that phrase) and look
under \data types" where there is a sublist for contin-
uous quantitative characters. For discrete characters
there are programs in the parsimony category, and for
Bayesian treatment of 0/1 traits there are programs by
Mark Pagel (BayesPhylogenies) and John Huelsenbeck
and Fredrik Ronquist (in MrBayes). And there is an
MCMC program by me based on the threshold model
for 0/1 traits in quantitative genetics. Its link is in my
paper in American Naturalist a month or two ago.
J.F. |- Joe Felsenstein
Response #4
You can use Nona combined with Winclada provided
by Pablo Gollobo. It is free, friendly using and fast.
Response #5
it's been a while since I used it, but Mesquite is
pretty good: http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/-
mesquite.html Response #6
I teach undergraduate courses and I have trouble nd-
ing the perfect freeware for morphological phylogenetic
analysis. In the meantime, I use Mesquite and give
the students a very detailed instruction (in German) so
they don't mess up. The problem with Mesquite is that
it puts out the same topology as a bunch of trees that
dier only by the location of the root, which is very
confusing to the user. Also confusing is that Mesquite
has so many options and dierent ways of doing the
same thing. Aside from that it's a great program.
Response #7
(I will also make a suggestion; Biolinux. Just copy the
les to a USB key, plug in the USB key and reboot.
Then not only do you have lots of phylogenetic soft-
ware but many other kinds of analysis software as well.
Alternatively, web sites like Moblye from the Pasteur
oer lots).

Shipping dry DNA pellet answers
Thanks to all of you for your responses!
Please nd below all the messages that I received. For
the most part, people said that they have not experi-

expressed some concerns about the ability to resuspend
overdried DNA after applying the speed-vacuum.
Cheers, Margarita
We regularly ship dry DNA and it works very well.
EtOH precipitation and vaccum or air dry. Ship the
pellet as is and rehydrate to use.
Hope this helps

Hi,
The company we currently use asks us to ship DNA in
alcohol, but I think I did post some dry DNA pellet a
long time ago.
Best, Maureen
I don't know whether that helps but I used RNA
stable (Biomatrica: http://www.biomatrica.com/-
rnastable.php) to ship my RNA samples from Germany
to the USA for ^A later microarray analyses - and it
worked pretty well! ^A I know that Biomatrica also oer
\DNAstable" which - as I guess - should work similarly
for DNA samples... For my RNA preparations I needed
to speed vac - I guess it should be the same with DNA...
As far as I remember you can download a pdf from the
Biomatrica homepage which describes the procedures
which are needed for preparing your samples - just have
a look there...
Good luck!

We have good experience with freeze-dried samples. We
received quite some genomic DNA samples from collab-
orators that way, but also normally primers are shipped
freeze dried. I do not know about shipping pellets, but
can tell you that we in rare cases air-dry pellets even
over the weekend (but they are of course dry after a few
hours) and they dissolve ne after the 2 days. So if the
shipping is not too long, drying them and sending them
should work as well. I would not recommend to speed-
vac them completely dry. In my experience an overdried
pellet dissolves only very hard and it's not perfect for
the DNA, either. I would in any case try some mock
samples rst to see if it works for your amounts, pellet
size, extraction method, shipping conditions, ...
Good luck!

{ PhD student Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical

8 07745 Jena Germanyit is ne to just ship tubes with the dry DNA pellet di-
rectly after DNA extraction; however, it would be best
to re-suspend the pellet rst to check the quality of the
DNA before you send it. If you do this, then you can
simply allow an aliquot of the re-suspended DNA to
dry out at room temperature or speed vac under a low
heat. It is not always necessary to go to the trouble of
re-precipitating and drying the pellet (which also runs
the risk of you loosing some of your valuable DNA).
Hope this helps, Will G-C
I've done this quite a bit and there's never been a prob-
lem. Drying with a speed-vac would be best but if you
don't have one, then just letting it evaporate would be
ne too. Probably best to put a tissue or something
loosely over the top. You could put it in an incubator
or heat block to speed that evaporation along but don't
set it too warm, else it might aect (denature) the DNA
- no more than 40 deg I reckon. Make sure it's totally
dry before you seal it up and send it.

You should not have problems sending dry DNA. I
have even send DNA in solution through Fedex and
the PCRs worked after been stored in the customs of-
ce for days! DNA is pretty stable, and when is dry
you shouldn't expect much troubles.

I've heard the DNA can be hard to rehydrate after
speed vac drying (I haven't tried so i dont know) It's my
understanding that lyophylizing is better - that's how
primers get shipped If you have access to a lyophylizer,
its pretty easy - just practice with some colored water
before drying your samples so you dont end up sucking
the samples out of the tubes. the key is to make sure
the samples never thaw

it's high molecular weight material and the downstream

Dear all,
We have released a new version of jModelTest2 for thestatistical selection of models of DNA substitution. The
main new features are:
- High Performance Computing: model selection can be
transparently executed in parallel in multicore desktop
machines and in HPC clusters achieving large speedups.
- Hill-climbing hierarchical clustering: to explore the
full set of 1624 GTR+I+G submodels, but optimizing
at most 288 while maintaining accuracy. - Heuristic
ltering: reduction of the candidate models set based
on a similarity ltering threshold - Absolute model t:
information criterion distances can be calculated for
the best-t model against the unconstrained multino-
mial model - Topological summaries: tree topologies
supported by the dierent candidate models are sum-
marized in the html log, including condence inter-
vals constructed from cumulative models weights, plus
Robinson- Foulds and Euclidean distances to the best-
t model tree. - User-friendly HTML log: the results
of the model selection can be displayed in html format
including maximum likelihood trees derived from each
model and linked to http://www.phylowidget.org4 for
graphical depiction.

Unique (and Low-Cost) Opportunity for Ten Under-
graduates 2013 Ecological Genetics Field Study Abroad
in China
FINAL YEAR OF PROGRAM
*Learn Chinese and Ecological Genetics at the Univer-
sity of Georgia*
With funding from NSF's Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, we
are oering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens or per-
manent residents only) the opportunity to participate
in a unique research abroad opportunity in China dur-
ing the spring and summer of 2013. This is the 5th
year of the program and students have found it to be
enormously rewarding. This will likely to be the last
oering of this opportunity.
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic bio-
geographic study of species that are native to China
and invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a grow-
ing number of species native to the southeastern U.S.
and invasive in China.
Each summer, we run a 6 week eld course where we
visit biological communities throughout China. After
the eld course, students continue in short-term re-
search internships in our partner labs in China.
Students will need to be prepared to take full advan-
tage of this experience. Therefore, during the spring
semester, students must enroll at the University of
Georgia (UGA) and take 3 courses; two in intensive
elementary Mandarin Chinese and a laboratory course
in genetics. No prior experience with Chinese language
is required, although students should have had at least
a course in introductory biology and preferably courses
in ecology and evolutionary biology.
After 1 semester of Chinese, most of our students can
operate quite well in China.
The cost to the student of the summer program is mini-
mal: the grant covers travel to and within China, lodg-
ing and most meals. The student is responsible for
health insurance, visa costs and personal expenses. Stu-
dents are also responsible for the costs of enrolling at
the University of Georgia for all required courses (12
credit hours) (all students are charged at the in-state
tuition rate plus fees).
The deadline for applications is October 1, 2012.
Applications for the 2013 program are available
on our website: http://www.genetics.uga.edu/pire/-
undergrad.html. We encourage any interested students
to contact Dr. Mauricio for more information (mauri-cio@uga.edu).

Hello Everyone!
I am currently building up a science research/outreach
program in Dangriga, Belize called BioBelize (Biodiver-
sity Institute of Belize), www.biobelize.org. We pro-
vide inquiry based science instruction to students, but
we also want to create a space for scientists to perform
molecular work in Belize. We have currently completed
one year and are expanding our scope for the future. We
train local high school and university students in Belize
in the basics of molecular biology techniques. We be-
gan by building a small invertebrate collection and are
hoping to begin teaching students the basics of DNA
barcoding once we can supply some basic molecular bi-
ology equipment. We believe that DNA barcoding is a
great tool for getting students interested in science and
it will give them the skills needed to pursue a path in
evolutionary biology or biology related elds. Devel-
oping countries often lack the funds to build labs that
can be accessed by science students, and while we are
actively looking for funding, we are also reaching out to
all of you to see if anyone has excess lab equipment they
could donate to BioBelize to be used by local science
students. We are interested in anything, but would re-
ally appreciate the essentials for a basic molecular biol-
ogy lab: dry bath heat blocks, thermocyclers, microcen-
trifuge, micro-pipettes, 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes,
microscopes, vortexers, gel electrophoresis systems, mi-
crocentrifuge tube racks, and UV transilluminators. If
you have equipment, know someone who could help, or
just have general comments, please contact me!
Thanks for taking a moment to read this request and I
hope to hear from some of you, PS- We will add you or
your lab to our supporters page at BioBelize.org

Vial samples
I'm planning to preserve a very large number of beetle
larvae in 95% ethanol for later paternity analysis. In
the past I have kept each larva in its own eppendorftube, but that would be overly time consuming for this
quantity of individuals.
I would like to place entire families of larvae, ~40 indi-
viduals each, together into larger vials. I'd very much
appreciate it if anyone could weigh in on how likely
the samples are to be contaminated with the DNA of
their siblings. To clarify these will be whole individu-
als, rather than tissue samples, and they will be rinsed
with fresh ethanol before DNA extraction.

dated. The initial phase of the project will be in the
UK at Durham University for 12-18 months (depend-
ing on progress), and will focus on DNA extraction from
ancient samples (using a well-established ancient DNA
lab experienced with the same type of samples to be
used in this study V see deBruyn et al. (2009) PLoS
Genetics 5(7): e1000554) and next generation DNA se-
quencing. The nal phase of the project will be in the
US at UC Santa Cruz and will focus on the analysis of
the sequence data and integration with environmental
data in support of broader inference (6-12 months in
duration), in collaboration with Paul Koch (Professor,
UC Santa Cruz).

Postgraduate and Postdoctoral Vacancies in Ecological
Demography
The University of Hong Kong is looking to recruit at
the postgraduate and postdoctoral levels with projects
which seek to understand 'How wildlife populations re-
spond and adapt to environmental change'.
The projects will be based in the Laboratory of Wildlife
Demography, School of Biological Sciences, but will in-
volve interactions with other departments in the Fac-
ulty of Science and beyond. The projects will combine
insights from several disciplines, most notably ecology,
evolutionary biology, demography, statistics, and cli-
matology. There will be an emphasis on understand-
ing how changing climatic conditions can aect wildlife
population processes. Attention will be given to the
ecological consequences of change in not just average
temperatures but also in other aspects of climate such
as inter-annual variability. The projects will involve
analysis and interpretation of long-term wildlife popu-
lation data, including data on wetland birds. More in-
formation can be found at http://www.biosch.hku.hk/-October 1, 2012 EvolDir 87
dthomson/home.html . Applicants should have good
academic track records with a relevant university de-
gree. The projects will require the ability to develop
not just an interest in ecology, but also strong ana-
lytical skills and the full range of abilities needed to
follow an interdisciplinary research project through to
fruition. Versatility and excellent communication will
be required as the projects will involve the comprehen-
sion, synthesis and presentation of ideas from quite dif-
ferent elds. The University of Hong Kong operates in
English, and language uency is a requirement.
Applications should include a CV with a statement of
academic interests and relevant experience, full aca-
demic transcripts for all qualications, a list of any pub-
lications, and the contact details of 3 referees. Appli-
cations should be submitted by e-mail (apply-wildlife-
demography-2012@hku.hk) to Dr. David L. Thomson.
Review of applications will begin right away, continuing
until decisions have been made and recommendations
on all available positions have been passed to the re-
spective university committees for approval.
Postdoctoral appointments: funding is already avail-
able and appointments can commence as soon as possi-
ble after a formal oer has been made by the university
and once the candidate has been awarded their degree
of PhD.
Postgraduate appointments (funding available in com-
petition): scholarship positions are available from the
university in open competition, and strong candidates
will receive the necessary endorsement and assistance
with that process. That endorsement should be sought
now as the applications for those scholarships need to
be submitted by 1st December for the main round.
There are further clearing rounds in May and Septem-
ber. Those appointments will normally be taken up at
the start of the coming academic year after a formal
oer has been made and after award of an undergradu-
ate degree. See http://www.hku.hk/gradsch/web/ for
more information on postgraduate scholarships.

logical services in agricultural landscapes since the re-
lease of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005)
and the policies (e.g. Plan Ecophyto 2018). However,
many issues still remain to be tackled to fully integrate
the concept of services into everyday landscape plan-
ning, management and decision-making. In particu-
lar, the quantitative relationship between biodiversity,
(agro)ecosystem processes, services and land use is still
poorly understood. In agroecosystems, weeds provide
goods and services i.e. pollination but also disservices
as they induce yield loss due to competition with crops.
Therefore, an agroecological weed management strat-
egy has to face a trade-o between food provisioning
and regulation services provided by weeds. One way to
resolve this trade-o is to design spatio-temporal man-
agement strategies at the scale of the landscape and
evaluate their impact on the capacity of the landscape
to provide services.
This post-doc is devoted to the evaluation of such
strategies, which requires to :
1.88 EvolDir October 1, 2012
develop criteria and indicators evaluating the dier-
ent (possibly conicting) services provided by weeds,
as well as the constraints bearing on weeds manage-
ment actions (cropping systems, labor and material re-
sources...). These criteria and constraints may hold at
dierent spatial scales, but do not involve weeds dy-
namics.
2.
model the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
weeds/crop/human system under some xed weed
management strategies at the landscape scale.
The criteria, constraints and dynamics models will be
mathematically formalized and used jointly to build a
management strategy evaluation tool. An experimen-
tal (/in silico/) comparison of existing and expert weed
management strategies will be led.
A PhD project will start in October 2012 on new meth-
ods for the design of strategies for the management of
spatio-temporal processes. The PhD student will ex-
ploit the postdoc work on criteria/constraints, while
both will have to cooperate on the elaboration spatio-
temporal models and the experimental evaluation of the
strategies.

Salary: $32,100 - $36,610 per annum
This is an exciting opportunity for two Research Asso-
ciates with an interest in Speciation Biology to carry
out cutting edge research investigating the mechanisms
of speciation using genomics techniques.
The posts are funded until 31 December 2013 by the
European Research Council and will be based at the
Silwood Park Campus. A further extension of up to
one year is possible, subject to the availability of funds.
The successful candidates will work closely with Profes-
sor Vincent Savolainen (holder of the ERC Advanced
Grant) and his Research Group.The main research objective is to disentangle processes
and mechanisms, e.g. among neutral evolution, selec-
tive constraint, and adaptive evolution, that can lead to
the evolution of new species. The Howea palms are one
of our model systems (e.g. see Nature 441:210; PNAS
108:13188), but other plants and animals on islands will
be included. You will employ advanced modelling and
statistical tools in molecular population genetics and/or
genomics, to explore the speciation mechanisms in is-
land taxa. This work will complement genomic, labo-
ratory and experimental work undertaken by other Re-
search Associates in Dr Vincent Savolainen's Group.
Specically, we are looking for two Research Associates
to work on the following:
* comparative genomic analysis of two palm species
from Lord Howe Island * comparative gene expression
analysis of these sister species in relation to speciation
scenarios * analysis of ddRAD genotypes for the con-
struction of association maps between phenology and
genetic loci * comparative phylogenetic analyses on
other islands (Cocos, Norfolk)
Applicants must have a PhD (or equivalent) in evolu-
tion, ecology, genetics or a closely related discipline.
Strong expertise in genomics (such as ddRAD, genome
assembly, transcriptome assembly, and/or gene expres-
sion analysis from NGS data), prociency in statistics,
advanced modelling techniques are essential as well as
knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
You must also have knowledge of speciation biology, in
depth experience of working in speciation biology and
experience of management and analysis of complex ge-
netic data. A publication record in top-class journals in
evolutionary biology, ecology or genomics is essential.
You must have experience of working in a team, and in
a multi-disciplinary environment, the ability to develop
and apply new concepts and have a creative approach
to problem-solving. You must also have excellent verbal
and written communication skills and be able to write
clearly and succinctly for publication.

Postdoc position in Plant Evolutionary Genetics at
Newcastle University, UK. We are looking for an en-
thusiastic postdoc for a 3-year NERC-funded research
project entitled: 'Inter-genomic conict in gynodioecy
and its eects on molecular evolution of mitochondrial
genomes in the genus Plantago'.
The applicant will be based in Kirsten Wol's group
in the School of Biology, Newcastle University, and will
collaborate closely with Deborah Charlesworth's group
at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of
Edinburgh, where an additional postdoc will be part of
the same project.
This project will use molecular evolutionary approaches
to investigate the maintenance of cytonuclear polymor-
phisms in gynodioecious plants in the genus Plantago,
to test whether an 'arms race' situation prevails, versus
long-term balancing selection. In the project we will
be obtaining and analysing DNA sequences of multi-
ple nuclear and mitochondrial genes, to compare diver-
sity, and test for long-term balancing selection. Non-
gynodioecious species will be studied, as well as gynodi-
oecious ones, to provide outgroups for sequence anal-
yses and to test whether the high diversity expected
under long-term balancing selection is conned to the
gynodioecious species. The project also includes testing
for paternal inheritance/leakage by testing for hetero-
plasmy in natural populations of P. lanceolata, using
analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence haplotypes
and studies of ospring of reciprocal crosses to assess
the possibility that within-species polymorphism could
explain the highly elevated mutation rates estimated in
Plantago lineages.
The work will be divided between Edinburgh and New-
castle. For example, the Edinburgh group will concen-
trate on the nuclear genes, while the Newcastle group
will obtain the mitochondrial genes, while other work is
shared. Field work and greenhouse work will predomi-October 1, 2012 EvolDir 91

Postdoc: Mathematical Modeling of Dengue Virus Epi-
demiology
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The incumbent will work
on an NIH-funded project that will build, test and
rene stochastic, spatially explicit, simulation models
that link insect population dynamics and genetics with
human disease epidemiology. We aim to develop a city-
scale model for the transmission of dengue virus, uti-
lizing rich entomological, epidemiological and human
movement data sets from a research collaboration fo-
cused in Iquitos, Peru. A major goal of the work is
to predict the impacts of various interventions (such as
conventional mosquito control, vaccines, and evolution-
based novel transgenic mosquito management methods)on dengue. The culmination of the project will be the
execution of a large-scale mosquito control study and a
comparison between observed and model-predicted dy-
namics.
Our major new modeling eorts will be to develop the
epidemiological component of our model and to increase
the spatial scale of our mosquito population dynam-
ics/genetics models. We are also interested in building
simple spatial and non-spatial, deterministic models as
heuristic tools for better understanding basic principles,
but we are not looking for applicants who are only in-
terested in working with simple, generic models.
An important part of our project involves eld exper-
iments to acquire data that will inform the structure
and parameterization of the models, and a large-scale
mosquito control study to provide data against which
model predictions will be tested. This position could
involve analysis of these and other data, so statistical
experience, particularly involving parameter estimation
and/or uncertainty quantication, would be benecial.
The person in this position will have the opportunity to
travel to Peru and assist in design of eld experiments.
Some hands on eld-work is also possible.
The funding for this postdoctoral position is through
an NIH research grant. However, our group also has
an NSF-IGERT graduate training grant titled \Genetic
Engineering and Society: The case of transgenic pests".
Six students in the rst IGERT cohort are focusing on
mosquitoes and dengue. The person in this postdoc-
toral position will have the opportunity to work with
the students and faculty involved in the IGERT pro-
gram. (Seehttp://geneticengsoc.ncsu.edu/ )
Qualications: Training in ecological or epidemiologi-
cal modeling and experience with development of com-
puter simulation models. Experience in C++ would be
highly desirable, as would be statistical skills.

Post-doctoral position
Impact of plant domestication on the evolution of plant-
associated organisms
Ohio State University
Review of applications beginning October 8
We seek a postdoctoral researcher to join an inter-
disciplinary project studying the impacts of plant do-
mestication on the evolution of plant-associated organ-
isms. The genetic bottlenecks that accompany selective
sweeps profoundly aect the levels of genetic diversity
found in domesticated plant species, while also aect-
ing loci underlying important morphological, physiolog-
ical, ecological, and biochemical characteristics. The
dramatic change in the genetic diversity of plant hosts
can also have cascading eects on genome evolution in
the community of associated organisms. In the long
term, this project seeks to identify the genes that led
to domestication-induced adaptive divergence and spe-
ciation in both plant and plant-associated organisms.
Our project focuses on chile pepper (Capsicum an-
nuum) as a model system to understand the molec-
ular basis of coevolution at multiple scales-from the
genome to the organism, and, eventually, the commu-
nity. C. annuum, one of the most diverse species within
its genus and cultivated world-wide, includes nearly 50
recognized types that range from the mildest bell pep-
per to the hottest cayenne. The focus region of the
study will be Mexico, which is C. annuum's center of
domestication, where its progenitor (Capsicum annuum
ssp. glabriusculum) grows in wild and semi-cultivated
settings. Research questions will relate to: C. an-
nuum population genetic diversity along environmental
and domestication gradients; adaptation, populationgenomics and ecological speciation of insect host races,
fungi and oomycetes; and tri-trophic interactions.
We seek applicants with an interest in evolutionary bi-
ology and experience using a range of techniques from
quantitative and molecular genetics, genomics, and/or
bioinformatics to answer ecological and evolutionary
questions. Skills related to genome annotation, de-
tection of genomic loci and/or regions under arti-
cial or natural selection, or other ecological genomic
techniques are a plus. The successful candidate will
hold this position for two years with the possibility of
an extension pending funding. Applicants should be
interested in spending signicant time in Mexico on
collecting trips in conjunction with Mexican collabo-
rators. Command of the Spanish language is also a
plus. This postdoctoral position will be part of a cluster
hire by the Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS;
caps.osu.edu/). Review of applications will begin on
October 8, 2012 and continue until a satisfactory can-
didate is found. The position can start as soon as Jan-
uary, 2013.

mographic histories: Deer mice (Peromyscus manicu-
latus), HCM viruses, Drosophila melanogaster and hu-
mans.
To develop and apply these new tools, we are seeking a
highly motivated candidate with a strong background
in bioinformatics, computer science, statistics, and/or
computational biology. The candidate should bring ex-
perience in programming, preferentially in C++ and
at least one scripting language. Knowledge in popula-
tion genetics is a plus. The successful candidate will
be working in a highly interactive and stimulating en-
vironment and is expected to collaborate with people
from several dierent labs, on and o campus.
The EPFL oers excellent facilities for research and

should be made on-line:

vacancies/index.cfm?fuseaction=-
3Dvacancies.detail&vacancy ref=3016276&go=GO
Further details are also given on the above link.
Job description: This post requires a computational
biologist with skills in software development, bioinfor-
matics and molecular phylogenetics or molecular epi-
demiology. The post will entail building sequence anal-
ysis methodologies to answer evolutionary and epidemi-
ological questions of the key zoonotic viral pathogens
listed below. The core project will be to develop ex-
isting molecular epidemiological tools (in particular
the BEAST package) into a semi-automated analy-sis pipeline which can rapidly provide epidemiological
characterization of newly emerged epidemics. Particu-
lar emphasis will be on addressing problems of statisti-
cal phylogenetic analysis of very large-scale molecular
data sets owing from next generation sequencing tech-
nologies. The post will involve close collaboration with
other members of the consortium including computa-
tional biologists, epidemiologists and virologists.
Background: Preparedness, Prediction and Prevention
of Emerging Zoonotic Viruses with Pandemic Potential
using Multidisciplinary Approaches (PREDEMICS)
PREDEMICS is a European Framework 7 funded con-
sortium of 17 participant institutions.
Summary of the PREDEMICS project: The capacity
of zoonotic RNA viruses to emerge as major agents
of human disease can appear limitless. Current inter-
vention strategies have demonstrated limited success.
Rapid, innovative and eective solutions are needed to
reduce the apparently accelerating process of zoonotic
disease emergence. We will study the following zoonotic
viruses with epidemic potential in Europe: inuenza
virus, hepatitis E virus, viruses of the Japanese en-
cephalitis serocomplex and lyssaviruses. These diverse
viruses arise from the main reservoirs and vectors of
potentially emerging viral diseases and use the three
major routes of transmission: respiratory, faecal-oral
and vector borne. Inter-disciplinary studies will gen-
erate valuable data on patterns of crossing the species
barrier, transmission and disease emergence, including
ecological and anthropological factors which determine
virus availability and opportunities for exposure and
infection. We will unravel the complex biological inter-
actions between the virus and the recipient hosts that
drive the viral adaptation and elucidate the factors de-
termining the ability of the viruses to spread to and
between humans (including pandemic spread). Fur-
thermore, immune mechanisms of protection and novel
prevention strategies will be investigated. Data will be
compiled in a unique and freely accessible data-sharing
platform to build a framework for analysing the drivers
of pathogen emergence. Modelling, building on the
analysis of key data, will focus on the extent to which
pathogen trajectories are predictable and will identify
high-risk situations and environments. This will allow
improvement of disease surveillance, control, prepared-
ness and intervention. Training in leading European
Universities, as well as exchanges of approaches and
data sharing with national and international health or-
ganisations will strengthen European position in this
global challenge.
Essential: PhD in an appropriate discipline. Experi-
ence in computational biology, molecular phylogenet-October 1, 2012 EvolDir 97

in molecular evolution.

UExeter AntagonisticCoevolution
We are looking to hire a postdoctoral research asso-
ciate on a 3-year project on parasite modulation of
metabolism.
An astonishing outcome of the antagonistic coevolu-
tionary dynamics between host and parasite is the evo-
lution of parasite ability to interfere with host phys-
iology. The molecular details of such interference is
poorly understood, limiting our ability to decipher par-
asite virulence and its evolution.
A major component of parasite mediated 'host repro-
gramming' targets host metabolism and thereby results
in improved parasite growth. A particularly striking
example of this is the ability of several viruses to in-
crease the rate of glycolysis in infected cells by up to
370%. More elaborate modulations include, for exam-
ple, the alteration of lipid and GTP biosynthesis. These
ndings strongly indicate that a full understanding of
host-pathogen interaction and pathogen-caused disease
states require a holistic view that considers host and
the pathogen as a single system.
This project will concentrate on the interaction of
Burkholderia pseudomallei and Francisella tularensis
with human macrophages. Utilizing metabolic mod-
eling together with phenotypic proling and ux mea-
surements, we will achieve a better understanding of
how these parasites manipulate their host and cause
disease. The ultimate aim is to develop better strate-
gies of combating intracellular parasites and developing
robust analysis approaches at the host-parasite systems
level.

UK France PopulationDynamics
Post-doctoral position with the Game & Wildlife Con-
servation Trust (GWCT) in UK and France
Modelling the dynamics of Atlantic salmon populations
for the Morsh project
Position available from October 2012 to March 2015
With recent collapses in salmon populations there has
been pressure to gain an understanding of the causes
and patterns associated with population change in
salmon. Much of this understanding relates to changes
in the biological characteristics of salmon populations
and their relationship to environmental change. There
is also great concern for the future of southern Euro-
pean stocks of salmon which are seen as under threat
from recent and future changes to climate. Currently,
the partners (INRA Rennes and GWCT) hold a large
amount of under-exploited data of the biological at-
tributes of past and present salmon populations and
associated environmental variables, extending over 30
years. There may be potential to use data sets collected
on other rivers particularly from the UK. The Morsh
2 project will aim to exploit and interpret the data sets
held by the partners and others providing model out-
puts useful for managing salmon populations, particu-
larly as it relates to the southern European populations
in the Manche zone, making them more readily avail-
able for use in larger scale modelling of salmon popula-
tions and facilitating the transfer of information from
data-rich rivers to data-poor rivers.
The Post-doc will be based at GWCT in UK, but will
spend time in France (INRA, Rennes) as follows: 6
months in each of the rst 2 years and 3 months in
the last year. His supervision and guidance will be
completed jointly by Anton Ibbotson and Jean Marc
Roussel. The post-doc and supervisors will meet twice
a year throughout the 3 year position. Whilst the post-
doc will largely work on the data sets described above
he should ensure that he does not work in isolation
from other UK and French organisations that collect
and make use of similar data. In the UK this will
involve consultation and regular contact with the En-
vironment Agency and Cefas developing collaborative
working arrangements with these groups and ensuring
that the ndings from these cross-border investigations
are used to inform national assessments and manage-
ment. To this end a nominated person from the En-vironment Agency will assist in the supervision of the
post-doc.
The post-doc will have the following objectives: (A) To
collate all data held by INRA and GWCT on salmonid
populations and the environmental variables associated
with those populations and establish an appropriate
database; (B) to align the temporal and unit basis
of that data to ensure it is directly comparable (C)
Where there is historical scale material stored, assess
the potential for and then extract further useful data
on life-histories and freshwater and marine growth rates
from circuli distances (D) Develop population models to
identify biological, climate and other drivers of salmon
population abundance, keeping in mind the aim of de-
veloping models that can be applied more generally to
data poor rivers (E) Make recommendations to national
bodies, responsible for monitoring salmon stocks in the
programme area UK and France in relation to monitor-
ing stock status for salmon in those countries.
Requirements:
The successful applicant will have completed his/her
doctoral thesis and have a proven skill in statistical,
Bayesian or mathematical modelling.Since they will
have to deal with sta in France and the UK he/she
will have a working knowledge of both French and En-
glish languages.

the evolution of novel castes.
Closing date: December 20th, 2012.
Position length: 2 yearsStart date: Flexible, but no later than June 2013
The Postdoc will work in the team Social Interactions
in Evolution (Ecology & Evolution Laboratory, Univer-
sity Pierre & Marie Curie) located in central Paris. This
position is founded by the National Research Agency
(ANR). It is part of the ANTEVO project that aims
at studying the role of phenotypic plasticity and social-
ity in the process of evolutionary diversication, using
ants as a model. The Postdoc will mostly work with
Dr. Mathieu Molet. The EvoDevo part is carried out
in collaboration with Dr. Ehab Abouheif (McGill Uni-
versity, Montreal) and the eld work in Madagascar
with Dr. Brian Fisher (California Academy of Science,
San Francisco).
The Postdoc will test evolutionary and developmental
hypotheses by assessing imaginal disc development into

Postdoc position in evolutionary ecology /urban ecol-
ogy
A 18-months postdoc position in evolutionary ecology is
available in the laboratory \Ecology and Evolution" at
the University of Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris (CNRS
UPMC, UMR 7625). The postdoc is funded by the
\r egion Ile-de-France" (Paris district).
The postdoc research will be part of an interdisciplinary
project that aims at studying adaptations developed
by organisms living in urban environments. Previous
have suggested that individuals living in urban area
have specic characteristics as compared to individu-
als living in rural area (Evans et al. 2009). The com-
bination of particular traits would enable individuals
to successfully exploit urban environments. This ur-
banization syndrome may include increased reproduc-
tion rate, high aggressiveness, boldness, tameness to-
ward humans and tolerance to pollution. The degree of
melanin-based coloration has been frequently reported
to co-vary with life-history, morphological, physiologi-
cal and behavioural traits. A recent review highlighted
potential candidate pleiotropic genes aecting both the
degree of individual melanisation and other phenotypic
traits, including aggressiveness, tolerance to stress, en-
ergy homeostasis and anti-inammatory immune reac-
tions (Ducrest et al. 2008), suggesting that melanin-
based coloration would be associated with several traits
involved in the urbanization syndrome. The main ob-
jective of the postdoc is to investigate whether melanin-
based coloration reects adaptations to dierent urban
environmental factors (pollution. etc) in an emblem-
atic urban species displaying a melanin-based colour
polymorphism, the feral pigeon (Columbia livia). The
method will combine correlative approaches in the eld
and experimental approaches in captivity.
The candidate should have a PhD degree in evolution-
ary biology or ecology as well as good hands-on skills
on bird manipulation (blood sampling, injection etc) or
strong willingness to acquire them. A good background
in data analysis (statistics) and experiment design is
also recommended. A driving licence is indispensable.
All applicants from any nationalities are welcome.
The work will be conducted in the Laboratory of \Ecol-ogy and Evolution" (team: Ecophysiologie Evolutive)
in Paris under the supervision of Dr Julien Gasparini
and Dr Adrien Frantz http://ecologie.snv.jussieu.fr/).
Applications should contain a curriculum-vitae with a
publications list and the name and e-mail address of
two referees.

We are seeking an enthusiastic post-doctoral research
associate to join a 3 year Natural Environment Re-

genetic basis of sex allocation behaviour in the para-
sitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Female Nasonia facul-
tatively allocate the sex of their ospring in line with
predictions from Local Mate Competition (LMC) the-
ory. Whilst we have a detailed understanding of the
sex ratio phenotype, we know rather little about the
genetic control of sex ratio, or the genetic causes of
sex ratio variation. The project will involve a range
of approaches, including QTL analysis, RNA-seq tran-

EvolutionPesticideResistance
Job Title: Postdoctoral Fellow in the Evolution of Pes-
ticide Resistance
Application Deadline: Review of Applications will Be-
gin on October 15, 2012 Job Description: Two-spotted
spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and several closely re-
lated species are chronic pests in a number of important
West Coast perennial specialty crops. Mites including
T. urticae are well documented as developing resistance
to commonly used pesticides. Focusing on four spe-
cialty crop systems with endemic pest pressure from
spider mites (almonds, strawberries, hops, and pepper-
mint), we propose to leverage the latest molecular-levelresearch into mechanisms of the evolution of pesticide
resistance toward developing and validating rapid and
robust molecular methods for screening T. urticae pop-
ulations in our model crops for resistance to abamectin
and other popular miticides.
Development of such a technique would benet produc-
ers of these crops by indicating the presence or absence
of resistance genes within the mite populations in their
orchard, eld, or yard, which could lead to the adoption
of less disruptive, more selective insecticides for control
of the key direct pests.
The postdoctoral fellow will develop and validate robust
diagnostics including a quantitative sequencing proto-
col and PCR to follow insecticide/acaracide-based re-
sistance frequencies in the eld. The postdoc will also
assist in the planning and preparation of experiments
in addition to troubleshooting problems. The postdoc
is expected to prepare the results of the research for
reports, conference presentations and publication in re-
ferred journals.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. and experience with
molecular entomology, molecular ecology, molecular
evolution, or population genetics. Applicants having
previous experience applying genomics tools to eluci-
date mechanisms of the evolution of pesticide resistance
in insects are especially encouraged to apply.
Applicants are expected to have a strong publication
record, exhibit creativity in their work and enjoy collab-
orative interactions. Evidence of strong oral and writ-
ten communication skills including the ability to pub-
lish the results of scientic research in scientic journals
and present research at national/international confer-
ences is preferred.
The position is based in the Department of Entomol-
ogy at Washington State University, Pullman WA in
the laboratory of Dr. Laura Corley Lavine. The posi-
tion will be available for 1 year with renewal for up to
1 additional year based on performance.

you are qualied for the position, a CV and contact
information for at least three referees.

*POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS
Two post-doctoral positions are available in the re-
search groups led by *Francesca Luca *and *Roger
Pique-Regi*, at the Center for Molecular Medicine and
Genetics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI. The re-
search focus of the groups is on the genetic and molecu-
lar characterization of gene regulation from an *evolu-
tionary and functional *perspective. Examples of col-
laborative projects include: characterizing variation in
the response to hormonal and environmental stimuli,
identifying tissue-specic cis-regulatory modules with
DNase-I footprinting, and detecting signals of selection
and adaptation in gene regulatory regions. The ulti-
mate aim is to learn about the genetic and evolution-
ary basis of disease susceptibility and response to treat-
ment.
We have a strong record in using both *functional
*and* evolutionary genomics approaches*. We use
a combination of high throughput experimental plat-
forms and computational/statistical tools. We seek ap-
plicants who are very creative, energetic, and can work
independently. We operate relatively small but well-
funded and intense laboratories. The goal is that every-
one should have the resources, support and mentorshipneeded to be successful and become an independent in-
vestigator.
The two positions are intended for applicants with com-
plementary expertise. Specically we are looking for
talented individuals with either a strong experimental
and/or computational background that will contribute
complementary expertise to create a team jointly su-
pervised by Dr. Luca and Dr. Pique-Regi.
The experimentalist position would be under the di-
rect supervision of Dr. Luca, and requires experience
in collecting genome-scale data, in mammalian cell and
tissue culture techniques and in molecular genetics tech-
niques. Familiarity with the quantitative skills required
for the analysis of genomic data (e.g., Python, R, scripts
for setting up an analysis pipeline) is also required.
For the computational position (under the direct su-
pervision of Dr. Pique-Regi), applicants should have
a strong background in quantitative/statistical skills,
and a very strong interest in biological applications. A
background in genomics, gene regulation or statistical
genetics is an advantage, although we will consider out-
standing candidates with quantitative degrees (e.g. in
Statistics, CS, or Engineering)

University of California, Davis and Bodega Marine Lab-
oratory

sity of Rochester)
http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Front Page Intro-
duction Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized
modern systematics and become indispensable tools
in evolution, ecology and comparative biology, playing
an increasingly important role in analyses of biological
data at levels of organization ranging from molecules
to ecological communities. The estimation of phyloge-
netic trees is now a formalized statistical problem with
general agreement on the central issues and questions.
A nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
This Spring, for the fourteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-
vances in phylogenetic methodology, and then focuses
on methods and tools that can be brought to bear on
these \applied" issues in the context of a given phy-
logeny.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the Northern California coast, which has on-site
housing. Our newly increased bandwidth and access
to computing clusters allows us to utilize computer-
intensive approaches even in a one-week course. Thecourse format will involve equal parts of lecture, dis-
cussion, and hands-on software training. One afternoon
during the week will be left free for eld trips to local
natural areas.
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesian
and Maximum-likelihood estimation of phylogeny * Es-
timation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree con-
icts * Divergence-time estimation from sequence data:
relaxed clocks, fossil calibration * Analysis of charac-
ter evolution: maximum likelihood and Bayesian ap-
proaches, ancestral-state estimation, rates of trait evo-
lution * Analysis of morphological form, function of
complex character systems * Inference of diversica-
tion rates: detecting rate shifts, testing key innovation
hypotheses * Model specication issues: model selec-
tion, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing MCMC

Prerequisites Available housing limits course enroll-
ment to ~30 students. Preference is given to doctoral
candidates who are in the early to middle stages of their
thesis research, and who have completed sucient pre-
requisites (through previous coursework or research ex-

EvolutionaryDynamics Nov11-15
The Research School Ecology & Evolution of the Cen-
tre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies (Gronin-
gen, Netherlands) organizes a PhD level course on
Evolutionary Dynamics at the \Assumburg" Castle in
Heemskerk, the Netherlands.
Aims We want to provide the participants with a basic
understanding of dierent theories for slow and fast evo-
lutionary dynamics, and we want to stress the similari-
ties of several approaches by presenting their basics in a
single course. Lectures cover the basics of quantitative
genetics, theories of selection response and adaptive dy-
namics. By means of discussions and (computer) exer-
cises during the course, the participants should become
able to apply the tools presented to simple population
dynamical models, to turn them into evolutionary dy-
namical systems.
Our guest lecturer during the course will be
Luis-Miguel Chevin [https://sites.google.com/site/-
luismiguelchevin/], who will lecture on his own research
and who will be available for discussions.
The course will be held from 12 - 15 November 2011
at the \Assumburg" Castle in Heemskerk, the Nether-
lands. It is advised to bring your own laptop.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
