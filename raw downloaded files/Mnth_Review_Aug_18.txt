Dear Colleagues
MOLECULES to MICROBES
Our NoR HGT and LUCA meeting IV is being held on
the 5-6 November 2018 at the Eugenides Foundation
Hall in Athens, Greece. I've attached the motivation
statement and poster as well as our report from the pre-
vious conference for your attention. The scope of these
meetings is extensive enough to include all discussions
in relation to the origins of life and we hope that you
will be able to attend. Another important point about
the conference, is that your research will be featured
and your papers cited in the subsequent report.
In this respect we are now inviting the submission of
abstracts for oral presentation at the conference. Please
send to Elias Chatzitheodoridis at eliasch@metal.ntua.gr
or Sohan Jheeta at sohan@sohanjheeta.com. You can
also visit our website at www.nor-hgt-luca.com for more

1. Conservation of fungi: what, why, where and how?
2. Does all plant life depend on fungi? 3. And have
you forgotten the lichens? 4. Do fungi provide a greater
ecosystem service or disservice? 5. Fungal networking
??? who benets? 6. Panning for gold in the mould:
where do we nd commercial value in fungi? 7. Ex-
ploring the dark taxa: when does a molecular signature
become a species?

20^th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
Friday, 23 November 2018, 9:30 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre,
Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists' Forum represents an
exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE.
Send applications by e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com , supply-
ing your name, contact address and stating whether
or not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English and
in Word format no later than Friday 26 November 2018.
The body text should not exceed 150 words in length. Ti-
tle, authors, and their professional aliations/addresses
should be included with the abstracts. If the presen-
tation is co-authored, the actual speaker (oral) or pre-
senter (poster) must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
The le should be in editable format (.doc or .odt, notpdf) and titled Surname First-name YSF2018.doc, for
example Doe Jane YSF2018.doc.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

ANU is seeking expressions of interest from high-quality
candidates interested in pursuing a PhD exploring
the links between metabolism, thermal plasticity and
maternal eects in an Australian lizard. Field and lab
experiments will be designed to test both predictions
and assumptions stemming from pace-of-life theory and
the metabolic theory of ecology. There is ample exibil-
ity for the candidate to develop and pursue their own
research questions within this grand theme, but there
is an expectation that the candidate will make use of
broad-scale meta-analytic and comparative approaches
in combination with manipulative experiments.*The Candidate*: Suitable applicants will be enthusias-
tic and highly motivated, with a strong academic and
research background. A demonstrated ability to conduct
research is required and the student should have lab
and eld experience along with an interest in physio-
logical processes. Experience in programming and data
analysis is also desirable, but not essential.

sion of Ecology and Evolution at the Research School
of Biology at the Australian National University in
Canberra, Australia. The ANU is one of the best uni-
versities in the world and is one of the highest ranked
universities in Australia. The candidate will make use
of ANU's excellent semi-natural outdoor mesocosms
and temperature controlled facilities for conducting
experiments. Fieldwork will take place along Aus-
tralia's east coast. The candidate will also work closely
with collaborators, both abroad, and within the Re-
search School of Biology (*http://biology.anu.edu.au/-
research/divisions/ecology-and-evolution *) for various
aspects of the project.
*Expression of interest*: Expressions of interest
should be submitted directly to Daniel Noble
(*daniel.wa.noble@gmail.com *) by August 10, 2018.
Please include a brief statement on why you areAugust 1, 2018 EvolDir 11

Summary The marine ecosystem of the Southern Ocean
provides an exceptional natural laboratory to study evo-
lution and biodiversity. Increasing rates of environmen-
tal change, pollution, and other anthropogenic stressors
challenge organisms to adapt or migrate to avoid ex-
tinction. The project \Refugia and ecosystem tolerance
in the Southern Ocean (RECTO)" aims to characterize
the adaptive capacities of Antarctic key taxa, necessary
for these organisms to cope with climate change. In the
past few years the Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolu-
tionary Genomics has assembled an extensive collection
of Antarctic sh suitable for genomic and metagenomic
analyses. It provides also a strong base for biophysical
modelling. This expertise contributes to questions on
the diversity and distribution of life in the Southern
Ocean and its adaptive potential. You will develop
a highly competitive integrated and multidisciplinary
PhD proposal with a strong potential for application
(e.g. conservation and sheries management). The nal
focus will depend on the strengths and interests of the
candidate.

PhD studentship in the School of Natural Sciences and
Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University.
Group living provides substantial advantages but may
also engender conict over reproduction or other re-
sources. In order for groups to form and persist, animals
must be able to manage this conict. Across species,
complex sociality involves an interplay between domi-
nance hierarchies, aggression, submission, cooperation,
and kinship. Understanding these dynamics is a major
focus in social behaviour research. Much of the work
done so far has examined primates and other mammals,
however, conducting carefully controlled experiments
in these species is often dicult. The cooperatively
breeding cichlid sh, Neolamprologus pulcher, lives and
breeds in highly complex permanent social groups. N.
pulcher are small bodied and can easily be housed in
aquaria where these remarkable sh will perform their
full suite of social behaviour.
In order to understand the expression of conict manage-
ment behaviour we must understand both the functional
signicance of these actions and the mechanistic sub-
strates that underpin them. Oxytocin is well known
for its role in mediating social behaviour in mammalian
species including primates, but evidence is emerging that
this function is deeply conserved across vertebrates, and
that its homologue isotocin regulates social behaviour
in shes. This PhD project will examine the pheno-
typic expression of conict management behaviours in
N. pulcher, the role of isotocin in modulating those be-
haviours, and the importance of early life experiences in
organising adult social behaviour and its neurohormonal
substrates.
We will make use of a newly established breeding colony
at LJMU. Social behaviours can be scored within these
groups using both live observations and high denition
video recordings. The specic details of the project
are exible and can be developed in collaboration with
the successful candidate to align with his or her inter-
ests, skills and expertise. The project will be primarily
laboratory based, though some eld work may also be
possible.
Preferred candidate characteristics include a keen in-
terest in animal social behaviour; experience studying
behaviour in the laboratory and/or the eld; experience
with neuroscience and/or molecular biology techniques
(e.g., histology, immunohistochemistry, qPCR); strong
writing and analytical skills; knowledge of experimen-
tal design and statistical analysis. Previous experience
working with sh is desirable but not essential. Full
training will be provided, and the successful candidate
will benet from the diverse expertise of the supervisory
team.The preferred start date for the successful candidate
will be September 2018, but a January 2019 start is also
possible.
The scheme is available to UK/European Union students
with a Bachelors degree at 2:1 or above in a relevant

MacquarieU SpeciationInFinches
PhD position in Evolutionary Ecology at Macquarie
University, Sydney, Australia
We are pleased to announce an opportunity available
for a start from late 2018 to early 2019
Speciation in nches
This project aims to understand the mechanisms under-
lying the divergence of species and the importance of
two genomic features of often disproportionately large
eect between young taxa - the sex chromosomes, and
chromosome inversions. The research aims to provide
insight into speciation processes by focusing on recent
divergence in Australian nch species. The research will
integrate genomics and transcriptomics with the study
of traits closely aligned to speciation in birds - song,
colour, and sperm morphology and protein composition.
Novel insight is anticipated through the study of hybri-
dising subspecies in both the laboratory and the wild.
An overarching aim is to unite data from genomics, phe-
notype and behaviour to understand the forces driving
speciation.18 EvolDir August 1, 2018
This research is part of an international collaboration
with collaborators based at Cambridge (UK), Cornell
& Chicago (US), and Oslo (Norway), and may provide
opportunities for the student to work partly at these in-
stitutions. Laboratory work will be conducted in Sydney,
and eldwork will be conducted in northern Australia.
The project is supported by ARC DP funds and a schol-
arship from Macquarie University.
The Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie
University is a vibrant environment which oers ex-
cellent support to postgraduate students. A MQRES
Scholarship has already been assigned to this project,
but there are other scholarship opportunities available
to suitably competitive candidates. International candi-
dates are encouraged to apply.
The MQRES full-time stipend rate is $26,682 pa tax
exempt for 3 years (indexed annually). In addition to
external grant support for the project, there is addi-
tional internal funding (up to $14k) available to cover
direct research expenses and conference travel.
Applicants should have a research-based MSc in a related
discipline (minimum 50% of grade based on research
project), and additional relevant research experience. A
competitive candidate is likely to have published in the
peer-reviewed literature. For these projects an ability to
work in remote and harsh conditions, and experience in
capturing and handling animals is desirable. A driving
licence is desirable but not essential.
Applications should include 1) your CV, 2) a brief state-
ment of your reasons for applying (max. 500 words), 3)
contact details of two academic referees, 4) your nation-
ality (for scholarship eligibility purposes). Applications
should be submitted electronically as a single PDF le.

conservation concern
Dr. Anna Muir and Dr. Matt Geary - University of
Chester
Project partner: Ed Harris - Manchester Metropolitan
University
White-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia) are a habitat-
specialist dragony that are currently classied as endan-
gered on the British Red Data list. They are of conserva-
tion concern due to low numbers across Britain and have
been reintroduced to sites in England following local ex-
tinctions. The largest remaining populations are found
in the Scottish Highlands. However, breeding sites are
separated by large areas of unsuitable habitat and the
connectivity between these sites is currently unknown.
Furthermore, attempts at traditional capture-recapture
techniques to assess dispersal in dragonies have led to
very low recapture rates, making the method unsuitable
for white-faced darter. Therefore, the development of
landscape genetic techniques to assess connectivity in
relation to habitat is urgently needed in this species.
This project will develop molecular techniques to facil-
itate landscape genetic analyses of white-faced darter,
including a preliminary analysis of connectivity between
two sites in Scotland. The student will use a range of
molecular techniques, including DNA extraction, PCR
and genotyping, and landscape genetic analyses using
population genetic software, ArcGIS and Circuitscape.
The results of this study will be used to form conser-
vation recommendations with key stakeholders and to
inform future white-faced darter research.
The ideal candidate will have previous experience of
laboratory work (including DNA extraction and PCR).
Additional fees to support this project are required up
to a maximum of pounds 3000 (specic nal cost will
be conrmed and agreed prior to acceptance on the
course).
The anticipated starting date for this project is OctoberAugust 1, 2018 EvolDir 19

Predicting Evolution
The aim of this project is to predict evolutionary out-
comes from population sequencing data of a single sam-
ple. To assess whether this is possible we will rst fully
characterize the mutational tness eects distribution
(MFED) of phage PhiX174, a very well studied phage
with a very short genome. We will infer the MFED from
population sequencing data. The MFED will allow is to
devise our rst model to predict evolutionary outcomes.
To test and rene this model we will perform an evolu-
tion experiment. Ultimately we are aiming to determine
the earliest point in the evolution experiment at which
we can, with high condence, predict the evolutionary
outcome of the experiment.
The successful candidate will work in the wet lab, de-
vise programs to analyze large amounts of sequencing
data and apply mathematical models to understand the
data. Hence we are looking for a candidate with either aquantitative background (bioinformatics, physics, math-
ematics or computer sciences) with a keen interest in
biology or a candidate with a biological background and
good programming skills.
The PhD would be performed in the Microbial

PhD project on Diapause Evolutionary Physiology
The Department of Zoology at Stockholm University
invites applications for a four-year PhD position as
part of the project 'The evolutionary physiology of hy-
pometabolism' funded through a grant from the Swedish
Research Council, VR.
Hypometabolism (HM) refers to states of heavily sup-pressed metabolism. These are pervasive in the animal
kingdom, but mechanistic underpinnings and physiolog-
ical commonalities among species are unclear. This is
surprising, since HM is a critical part of the life-cycle
in most ectothermic animals living in seasonal environ-
ments, of large adaptive value in several important insect
pest species and a feature of several pathological states
in humans. In this project, the student will use insect
diapause, a deep resting stage, as model phenotype to
study HM.
We will combine several approaches: (i) characteriza-
tions of pupae in diapause using several state-of-the-art
imaging methods, (ii) multiple-level \omic" investiga-
tion of key functional physiological layers and (iii) direct
manipulations of key metabolites and genes in detailed
rearing experiments, using pharmacological injections
and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout. By integrating these
data we will build physiological models of how HM
is induced, maintained and terminated. The project
therefore oers the PhD-candidate a chance to learn a
variety of modern methods in organismal biology and
can be tailored in several directions according to the
skills, aptitude and interests of the PhD-candidate.

TU Munich PopulationGenomics
The Chair of Phytopathology at the Technical Univer-
sity of Munich, TUM School of Life Sciences, hires a
PhD. Student in the eld of Population genomics of
pathogens on wild tomato species.
We are interested in understanding the evolution of
pathogens and pathogen resistance in relatively short
time scales, therefore we study dierent populations
from a diverse and geographically dierentiated tomato
species, Solanum chilense. We have shown that these
populations show dierent levels of defence against a
range of pathogens and have identied patterns of dier-
ential selection for defence-associated genes. However,
knowledge of the pathogens occurring on these natural
populations is lacking.
Therefore, we are looking for an enthusiastic PhD stu-
dent to collect pathogens in the eld, investigate their
virulence on dierent plant populations and assess ge-
netic diversity using whole genome sequencing. The
applicant must have a very good MSc in biology, bioin-
formatics or related disciplines. Knowledge and practical
experience in bioinformatics and population genomics
and keen interest in molecular plant pathology and lab
work are required. Sample collection will take place in
the highlands of Peru and Chile, therefore the appli-
cant should be t and willing to travel to said places
for several weeks. English skills, both written and spo-
ken, are essential, knowledge of the Spanish language is
benecial, but not required.
The project will be carried out in the group of Dr.
Remco Stam at the Chair of Phytopathology (Prof. Dr.
Ralph H uckelhoven). The chair hosts several research
groups studying plant pathogen interactions. In addi-
tion, we have several ongoing collaborations on campus
(including the large SFB924 project) and direct access
to state of the art technology for next generation se-
quencing and extensive glass house facilities.

UBath ExperimentalEvolution
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD
student to work on the evolution of gene regulatory
networks using experimental evolution.
Deadline: Sunday 5th August 2018
Enquiries and application: https://www.ndaphd.com/-
search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=99028 Project De-
scription How does the environment shape the archi-
tecture of genomes? The environment plays a key role
in shaping gene regulatory networks (GRNs), with nat-
ural selection able to make adjustments to specic in-
teractions. However, we do not yet understand the
evolutionary processes that create and constrain op-
portunities for GRN adaptation and expansion. My
research takes an interdisciplinary approach, combining
experimental evolution with molecular genetic manipu-
lations, bioinformatics and protein modelling to address
central evolutionary questions within the context of
GRN evolution.
As networks evolve and expand they incorporate new
genes with new functions. Natural selection will shape
these interactions, resulting in gene networks that are
most suited to the environment that the organism
evolved in. As such, dierent environments have the
potential to rewire gene networks dierently, as dierent
interactions will be advantageous in some environments
and disadvantageous in others. In this way, the envi-
ronment can create and constrain opportunities for new
interactions to evolve. In this project, we will directlytest this theory by evolving bacteria in real-time to ex-
plore how the environment can shape gene interactions,
gene networks and genomes.^ a euro ^ATo investigate we
will use bacteria, which can be easily stored and ge-
netically manipulated in the laboratory. Their rapid
generation times and large population sizes means evo-
lution can occur very quickly. Plus, understanding what
shapes the evolution of gene networks in simple organ-
isms will provide greater insight into the overarching
principles that may drive the evolution of all gene net-
works. Answering these big questions in biology will
deepen our understanding of how complex organisms
evolve and how life copes with environmental change.
Location: This project will be conducted under the di-
rect supervision of Dr Tiany Taylor with co-supervision
from Dr Susanne Gebhard and based at the Depart-
ment of Biology and Biochemistry at the University
of Bath (UK) in the new Milner Centre for Evolu-
tion (http://www.bath.ac.uk/groups/milner-centre-for-

focused on doing ground breaking research that ad-
dresses major questions in evolutionary biology. The
Milner Genomics Centre provides on-site facilities and
expertise for genome sequencing and analysis for evo-
lution research, and the world-class researchers at the
centre creates a vibrant research culture that ensures

The PhD candidate will combine microcosm experi-
ments with (statistical and mechanistic) modelling to
examine if and how the level of intraspecic variability
modulates the eects of global change (temperature and
pollution) on population and community dynamics, and
coexistence in competitive protist (freshwater ciliates)

matic analysis. We will maintain good communication
between all participants. The position therefore comes
with possibilities to visit participating labs and groups in
Berlin, Berkeley, Copenhagen, Oxford, and Cambridge
(MA).
Analysis of time-series of samples using whole-genome
sequencing promises to be a powerful way of understand-
ing evolutionary history, in particular, for detecting se-
lection. The PhD project is about the time-series part
of the overall project.
We are looking for a highly motivated individual with a
strong interest in evolutionary and population genomics.

PredictingAntimicrobialSpread
Note early deadline: Wednesday 11 July
An opportunity has arisen for a D.Phil. (Ph.D.) place
on the BBSRC-funded Oxford Interdisciplinary Bio-
science Doctoral Training Partnership in the area of
Articial Intelligence, specically 'Predicting the spread
of antimicrobial resistance from genomics using machine
learning'.
If successful in a competitive application process, the
candidate will join a cohort of students enrolled in the
DTP's one-year interdisciplinary training programme,
before commencing the research project and joining
Danny Wilson's research group at the Big Data Institute.
See www.danielwilson.me.uk This project addresses the
BBSRC priority area 'Combatting antimicrobial resis-
tance' by using ML to predict the spread of antimi-
crobial resistance in human, animal and environmental
bacteria exemplied by Escherichia coli. Understanding
how quickly antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will spread
helps plan eective prevention, improved biosecurity,
and strategic investment into new measures. We will de-
velop ML tools for large genomic datasets to predict the
future spread of AMR in humans, animals and the envi-
ronment. The project will create new methods based on
award-winning probabilistic ML tools pioneered in my
group (BASTA, SCOTTI) by training models using ge-
nomic and epidemiological data informative about past
spread of AMR. We will apply the tools collaboratively
to genomic studies of E. coli in Kenya, the UK and
across Europe from humans, animals and the environ-
ment, Enterobacteriaceae in North-West England, and
Campylobacter in Wales. Genomics has proven eective
for asking 'what went wrong' in the context of outbreak
investigation and AMR spread; here we will address the
greater challenge of repurposing such information using
ML for forward prediction of future spread of AMR.
Scrutiny will be intense because future predictions can
and will be tested, raising the bar for the biological real-
ism required while producing computationally ecient
tools.
Attributes of suitable applicants: Understanding of ge-
nomics. Interest in infectious disease. Some numeracy,
e.g. mathematics A-level, desirable. Experience of cod-
ing would help.32 EvolDir August 1, 2018

UValencia EvolutionSexualConict
PhD Student- The role of ecology in the evolution of sex-
ual conict What do we oer? We oer a PhD position
starting on September 2018 to January 2019.
To do what? We are looking for a PhD student interested
in studying the evolutionary factors modulating the in-
tensity of male-male competition and sexual conict,
and its consequences in terms of population viability.
Strong sexual selection can improve population viability
and evolvability through a number of processes, such
as genic capture. However, strong sexual selection will
also often give rise to sexual conict and female harm,
which does not only tend to deviate females from their
evolutionary optima, but can drastically aect popu-
lation viability, leading to a \reproductive tragedy of
the commons". We are still far from understanding
what factors modulate the evolution of female harm
levels, and sexual conict at large, and how this feeds
back into population viability. Our on-going research
aims to contribute to ll these gaps in knowledge by
investigating factors potentially modulating the evo-
lution of sexual conict. This PhD will explore the
role of dierent ecological and demographic factors (e.g.
temperature, population density and structure) aect
male-male competition levels and the potential for sex-
ual conict, mainly in Drosophila melanogaster. The
research project involves behavioural experiments in the
lab, experimental evolution, and considerable eldwork
in Spain, the USA and Australia.
Funding We oer funding for up to 3+ yrs, but appli-
cants will be expected to apply for independent PhD
fellowships. Where? The student will be supervised
by Dr. Pau Carazo, and based at the Behaviour and
Evolution group of the Ethology Lab, at the Cavanilles
institute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology (Uni-
versity of Valencia, Spain). For information about our
group visit our website (http://paucarazo.com).Who? We are looking for a motivated, enthusiastic,
hard-working candidate with some background (and a
strong interest) in sexual selection, and evolutionary
biology and animal behaviour at large.

est, please contact Pau Carazo (University of Valencia;

the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientic42 EvolDir August 1, 2018
Research (JNCASR) is interested in hearing from those
who would like to be considered for possible hiring as
Fellow or Faculty Fellow (equivalent to Assistant Pro-
fessor) in this Unit. The Unit is among the best centres
for research and training in whole-organismal biology in
India, with a very strong focus on high quality graduate
teaching. This is an informal call from the Unit and not
a formal institutional advertisement. However, the Unit
may forward suitable names to the Centre for formal
action.
We are interested in people with a proven track record
of high quality research in the broad areas of ecology,
evolutionary biology, or animal behaviour, a demon-
strated ability to think independently and formulate
their own research questions relating to the functioning
of organisms in an ecological context and/or how such
functionality evolves, and a strong interest in and pas-
sion for teaching and mentoring. Faculty in the Unit are
required to teach at least one basic and one advanced
course each year, and, possibly, a laboratory course
every semester. We would like to hear from people do-
ing eld-based, lab-based, or theoretical research, and
especially those employing combinations of the three.
We are seeking people with strengths complementary to
rather than overlapping with existing faculty.
Potential fellows typically have at least 1-2 years of
postdoctoral research experience and potential Faculty
Fellows typically have at least 2-3 years of postdoctoral
experience. If you are interested, please write to Prof.
T.N.C. Vidya (Chair, EIBU) at tncvidya.lab@gmail.com
with a CV, statement of research interests, and state-
ment of teaching interests detailing the basic, advanced,
and laboratory courses you would like to teach. Please
also include PDFs of your three most signicant (not
necessarily highest impact) publications, along with an
explanation of why you rate them so.

Professor Tom Gilbert and colleagues at The Natu-

January 1st 2019, as part of the recently funded EU
Innovation Action ' ^AHolofood' that aims to apply
an evolutionary hologenomic framework (combined ge-
nomic/transcriptomic/microbiomic analyses) to improv-
ing salmon and chicken production. The network' ^As
partners are based in Denmark, Norway, Germany,
Spain, Poland, UK, but both positions are based in
Copenhagen.
We are specically looking for a 4 year project coordi-
nator, and a 4 year bioinformatic coordinator. Ideally
both should have a background in genomics and/or
microbiomics - as it is critical they understand the sci-
entic content of the topic. However neither position is
a research position per se.

The project coordinator will have 2 principal roles.
First to make sure the project moves smoothly, includ-
ing making sure the partners all full their obligations
on time (both research and reporting), e.g. through
physical visits, organising formal meetings. Secondly
to disseminate our ndings, e.g. attending conferences,
website/media, visiting other possible stakeholders from
academia/industry etc. Key skills are therefore to be
well organised, and good at communication, good at
following up on things (persistent' ^Abut in the nicest
way), and available to travel at least 3-4 times per year.
The bioinformatic coordinator' ^As role is to make sure
the computational infrastructure is all in place. We an-
ticipate much of the networks data will require analysis
using using nodes in the Elixir supercomputer network.
This position will be the key liaison to ensure all project
researchers have access/accounts on the network, the
relevant computational pipelines are in place, possiblyincluding modication, development of such pipelines.
Furthermore they will be tasked with ensuring the net-
work's researchers can actually use the supercomputers
and pipelines. Thus this is a position suited to some-
one who has some kind of bioinformatics background
(ideally relevant to genomics or microbiomics), but who
has organisational and personnel skills. The job is not
principally a research position, although there would be
scope for at least pipeline/informatic tool development.

AgeingLifeHistoryEvolution
Come work with us at BIO UEA to nd out why do
organisms age!
Two BBSRC-funded jobs (postdoc and research techni-
cian) are available in my lab to work on the project:
'The cost of longevity: transgenerational consequences
of parental lifespan extension'
We are seeking highly motivated and enthusiastic re-
searchers for BBSRC-funded project on the evolution of
ageing in the Maklakov lab in the School of Biological
Sciences at University of East Anglia.
This project is in collaboration with Prof. Tracey Chap-
man (UEA), Dr. Simone Immler (UEA) and Dr. David
Thybert (Earlham Institute).
Understanding ageing is one of the big unsolved prob-
lems in biology. Recent progress in the study of ageing
has challenged the current paradigm that ageing results
from energy trade-os between survival and reproduc-
tion. In this project, we will work at the interface of52 EvolDir August 1, 2018
evolutionary biology and bio-gerontology towards the
goal of explaining the mismatch between this paradigm
and the empirical ndings. We will focus on i) un-
covering potentially missing parts of the classic sur-
vival/reproduction trade-o; and ii) testing an emerging
new theory of ageing that aims to replace the classic
view. In practical terms, we will use the whole range of
interventions that increase longevity and postpone senes-
cence - e.g. diet, pharmaceuticals that mimic dietary
eects, mutations and RNAi knockdowns of genes in
nutrient-sensing signalling networks in Caenorhabditis
nematodes - to link molecular signalling pathways to
physiological processes to transgenerational eects on
Darwinian tness. The ultimate goal here is to advance
our understanding of the ultimate causes of ageing while
making the \black box" of the mechanisms underpinning
life-history evolution more transparent.
The successful candidates will conduct experimental
work using Caenorhabditis nematodes as the model
organism, help supervising and training new lab mem-
bers and actively participate in the research life of the
lab and the School, such as seminars and journal clubs.
Funding is available for further training and professional
development by attending national and international
conferences and workshops.
Don't hesitate to contact me (A.Maklakov@uea.ac.uk)
to discuss the details of this project.
Research Environment:
The successful candidate will become a part of the grow-
ing lab that currently includes two postdocs, a labo-
ratory manager and a research technician. The lab is
part of the Organisms and the Environment theme at
the School of Biological Sciences at UEA. There sev-
eral world-class labs with similar interests at the theme,
including Prof. Tracey Chapman (ageing, diet, sex-
ual conict, Drosophila), Prof. Andrew Bourke (social
evolution and ageing in social insects), Prof. David
Richardson (telomere biology, ageing in birds), Prof.
Matt Gage (sexual selection, sperm competition), Dr.
Simone Immler (germline/soma interactions, zebrash
and mathematical modelling). Furthermore, there are
three world-leading research institutes (John Innes Cen-
tre, Earlham Institute and Quadram Institute) that
together with UEA and Norfolk and Norwich University
Hospital comprise Norwich Research Park, and provide
great opportunities for collaboration. Finally, PI has
strong ties with Uppsala University in Sweden and there
are opportunities for doing projects together with an es-
tablished nematode lab there. In our lab, we encourage
dynamic collaborative atmosphere and promote joint
projects and discussion clubs both within and outside
the immediate research group.1. 3-year Postdoc (Senior Research Associate) 32,548 -

Field assistant required for a help with PhD research
on superb fairy-wrens and their parasitic cuckoos for 5
months.
This project is looking at the maternal investment of
superb fairy-wrens and their parasitic Horseld?s bronze-
cuckoos. This is a great opportunity to gain valuable
eld skills, and experience in research and data collec-
tion. Volunteers will be part of the team working with
researchers and students on the project. The eld site
is in Campbell Park which is located 10 minutes drive
from the city centre in Canberra, Australia. The vol-
unteer will be required to work 5 days per week in the
eld (no matter the weather conditions) and must be
physically t as they will be required to walk around the
park often 10km per day. The volunteer and I will be
working together some days but most days will require
the volunteer to collect data independently in the eld
and communicate their ndings. Therefore teamwork
and communication skills are essential. The candidate
must also be self-motivated, enthusiastic, reliable and
have a good work ethic. Previous experience with sim-
ilar work or a degree in biology is preferable but not
essential. Volunteers will be trained in eld methods.
Main eld duties will include nding nests, monitoring
breeding attempts and documenting group dynamics
throughout the breeding season. We will also mist net
individuals so they can be banded for identication. Vol-
unteers will be required to identify individuals by their
colour band code using binoculars. Other task include
helping to cage nests to prevent predation and helping
to measure chicks and eggs.
Volunteers will be reimbursed $1000 per month to help
cover living costs but all other costs will need to be
covered by the volunteer. Fieldwork will begin at thestart of September 2018 and nish at the end of January
2019.

Diversity AvianGenomicEvolution
Other: Call for papers. Genomic Analyses of Avian
Evolution, Special Journal Issue.
Birds have been the focus of pioneering studies of evo-
lution ary biology for generations largely because they
are abundant, diverse, conspicuous, and charismatic. It
is little surprise then that this tradition has positioned
birds at the forefront of genome evolutionary biology.
Extensively collaborative ongoing programs to sequence
whole genomes or a variety of pan-genomic markers
of all 10,000 species of living birds further promise to
keep birds in the limelight in the near and indenite
future. Such comprehensive taxon sampling provides
untold opportunities for comparative studies in well doc-
umented phenotypic, adaptive, ecological, behavioral,
and demographic contexts, not to mention focus on dif-
fering characteristics of evolutionary processes across
the genome and among lineages. This comparative ap-
proach is leveraged by coordination and standardization
of data pipelines, as well as by encyclopedic knowledge
of the natural history of closely related birds that dif-
fer little except with respect to singular traits. Indeed,
genomics is a natural extension of many studies of pop-
ulation genetics and speciation that have been ongoing
for decades.
The journal Diversity is hosting a special issue titled66 EvolDir August 1, 2018
\Genomic Analyses of Avian Evolution" that will feature
a broad spectrum of original research articles representa-
tive of and reecting on comprehensive taxonomic sam-
pling projects, the genomic basis and evolution of spe-
cic adaptive traits, structural variation among lineages,
and higher level phylogeny accounting for incomplete
lineage sorting as inferred from novel pan-genomic mark-
ers. Current genomic studies of avian phylogeography
and of extinct birds are also likely anticipated. Com-
mitted authors include both icons and up-and-coming
mavericks, representing both extensive collaborations
and independent laboratories. We openly invite fur-
ther submissions for what will be a prominent thematic
compendium of cutting-edge genomic approaches to the
evolutionary biology of birds and of genome evolution
within birds.

to readers. Article Processing Charges (APC) will be

*ESEB Outreach Initiative Fund*
The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
welcomes applications to the ESEB Outreach Initiative
Fund for projects that promote evolution-related activ-

knowledge about evolution globally.
Applications for funding will be accepted for educational
initiatives that promote evolution, development of evo-
lutionary material (books, lms, web sites) intended for
a general audience, public outreach seminars, public ex-
hibitions, etc. While most projects will be nanced for
a sum between 1000-1500 Euro, exceptions can be made
if a strong argument is provided for additional funds.
Note that the ESEB Outreach Initiative Fund does not
work as a|mechanism for continual funding.|Once
the potential of a project/activity|has been demon-
strated, then this should be used as data to convince
other funding bodies|to provide continuation funds.
Hence, submissions by a group that has been successful
in past calls may be penalized if they are mere follow-ups
of previous projects.
The application form can be found on the ESEB
website (http://www.eseb.org/prizes-funding/outreach-

damarensis) in the Kalahari (South Africa). We are
conducting a long-term capture-mark and recapture

gate the life-history and social behaviour of Damaraland
mole-rats (http://kalahari-meerkats.com/kmp/research-
publications/damaraland-mole rats-group/). Entire
groups of mole-rats will be captured and individually
marked. Some individuals may be tted with a collar
to measure behavior. Morphological measurements and
tissue samples will be obtained before the release of
the animals. The eld work is physically demanding
and weather conditions are challenging (heat during
the day, cold during the night). Field work may make
trapping during the night necessary. The assistants will
mostly be working in teams of two or three but will be
embedded in a large research community. This position
requires working in a small team in a remote location
on free ranging animals. The trapping season will start
in September and last for 3 months. Research assistant
will require a valid driving license.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants
are paid a monthly allowance to cover their per-
sonal costs and food. The project is conducted in
collaboration with researchers from the Large An-
imal Research Group at the University of Cam-
bridge (https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/-

experience who are interested in learning ways to teach
with R eectively to students with little to no program-
ming experience. Participants will focus on developing,
implementing, and sharing modules for teaching statisti-
cal and biological concepts in R with Swirl. Swirl lessons
simplify the R learning process by providing a guided,
interactive experience through on-screen prompts and
exercises which students answer directly in the RStudio
console. Participants will learn the Swirl program, im-
plement one existing Swirl lesson, contribute one new
lesson and will leave the FMN with >10 ready-to-use
Swirl lessons covering diverse biology and data analysis
concepts.

BirdEvolutionaryBehaviour
Post-doc Position University of Veterinary Medicine Bu-
dapest, Hungary Life history consequences of nest site
selection
Choosing nest sites is a major life history decision, since
the vegetation around the nest inuences both the risk
of predation and the thermal properties of eggs and the
incubating parent. In this project we aim to investigate
nest site selection in a ground nesting shorebird with
biparental incubation, the Kentish plover. Because of
the dierent daily incubation schedule of the sexes, nest
cover can be a sexually antagonistic trait, furthermore
individuals may have consistent preferences for nest
sites. In the project we aim to understand the costsand benets of this important life history decision, and
its relation to sexual conict and personality of parents.
The project is led by Dr Andras Kosztolanyi (Univ Vet
Med Budapest, Hungary), Prof Zoltan Barta (Univ De-
brecen, Hungary) and Prof Tamas Szekely (Univ Bath,
UK), and will be run in close collaboration with the
\ELVONAL (cutting edge) - Breeding system evolution
in shorebirds" project of the University of Debrecen,
Hungary. The research group uses English as communi-
cation language.
This job oers an opportunity for an early-stage post-
doc who wants to combine eldwork with cutting-edge
evolutionary and behavioural science. The main tasks of
the post-doc are to carry out and supervise eld studies
in Kazakhstan, Russia and/or China (possibly in other
countries). We seek candidates with experience in be-
havioural ecology and eld biology preferable with birds,
shorebirds. Publications in high-quality peer-reviewed
journals, excellent communication skills, and solid skills
in data handling are essential.
This is a full-time position and the salary will be above
the normal Hungarian level (up to 1200 EUR, depending
on experience). Note that the cost of living in Hungary
is substantially less than in Western Europe. The posi-
tion is for 36 months (subject to probation period). See
further specications below.
Application deadline is 30 September 2018. The appli-
cation should include (1) a max two pages cover letter,
(2) a CV with list of publications, and (3) the name and
contact details of four referee preferably from research,
academia or conservation. The applications should be
emailed to Ms Fanni Takacs (fancsi t@hotmail.com).
Interviews will be in early October and the position is
available from 1 November 2018.

Postdoctoral position: Consequences of monarch but-
tery migration loss for parasite transmission and pop-
ulation genomics
A two-year postdoctoral position is available in the lab-
oratory of Jacobus de Roode at Emory University to
study the genetics and genomics of migration loss of
monarch butteries and to investigate the consequences
of migration loss for parasite transmission.
This postdoc is part of a collaborative NSF-funded
project to study the host-parasite dynamics of shifts
from migratory to non-migratory behaviors in monar-
chs. The project team consists of Sonia Altizer (lead
PI, University of Georgia), Richard Hall (University of
Georgia), Karen Oberhauser (University of Madison),
Elizabeth Taylor (Tulane University) and Jacobus de
Roode (Emory University).
Monarch butteries are best known for their spectacular
annual migration from North America to Mexico, but
recent years have seen the formation of resident popula-
tions of monarchs along the Gulf and southern Atlantic
Coasts. Our project focuses on understanding factors
that lower migratory propensity in North American
monarchs, and the consequences of resident behavior
for monarch-parasite interactions. The main respon-
sibilities of the postdoc will be to use whole genome
resequencing and population genomics approaches to
determine the extent to which recently formed resident
populations have genetically diverged from migratory
monarchs, to quantify levels of genetic mixing between
migratory and non-migratory monarchs, and to deter-
mine whether these monarchs have evolved adaptations
to their non-migratory lifestyle. In addition, the postdoc
will contribute to experimental studies to estimate how
shifts to a non-migratory lifestyle alter parasite trans-
mission, and will have the opportunity to participate
in eld collection activities aimed at sampling resident
and migratory monarchs.
Candidates should have a Ph.D. or equivalent in evo-
lution, genetics, ecology, or related eld, with a track
record of publication in peer- reviewed journals. The
ideal candidate for this position has experience with eld-
work as well as population genomics, including genome
library preparation, genome-wide SNP analysis, popula-
tion genomic tools, and the creation of bioinformatics
pipelines, together with excellent writing and communi-August 1, 2018 EvolDir 75
cation skills.
To apply, please send a single PDF containing a cover
letter, a CV, a one-page research statement, relevant
publication(s) and the names and email addresses of
three referees to jderood@emory.edu by 18 July 2018

HeliconiusGenomics
We are seeking to hire a postdoctoral fellow to work on
the comparative and population genomics of Heliconius
butteries. The postdoc is funded by a National Sci-
ence Foundation EPSCoR award to Mississippi State
University and the University of Puerto Rico that seeks
to better understand the genomic and developmental
changes that drive buttery wing pattern diversity.
Heliconius are renowned for their remarkable diversity
of wing color patterns within and between species. The
color patterns serve as warnings to predators of their
unpalatability and inuence mate preference of several
Heliconius species. Recently, we narrowed the genomic
regions responsible for wing pattern variation in Helico-
nius erato to a about a dozen non-coding regulatory re-
gions on four chromosomes (Van Belleghem et al. 2017).
The aims of the postdoc will involve (1) identifying the
regulatory sequence and structural variants across the
chromosomes associated with color variation (2) char-
acterizing the mode and tempo of evolution at color
pattern genes, and (3) reconstructing the evolutionary
history of adaptive color pattern divergence among vari-
ous Heliconius races and species. These data are part of
a large collaborative eort that combines whole genome
data with transcriptomics (RNA-seq), DNA accessibility
(CHiP-seq, ATAC-seq) and functional tests (CRISPR)
to better understand the evolution and development of
wing pattern variation. The position is for two years,
with the possibility to extend an additional two years
(4 years total). The start date is exible, but can begin
as soon as September 2018.
This postdoc position will be based in the Counterman
Lab at Mississippi State University, located in Starkville,a quaint college town in northeast Mississippi. The post-
doc will visit and work closely with collaborating labs,
including Federico Homann's lab at MSU, Riccardo
Papa's lab at the University of Puerto Rico, Arnaud
Martin's lab at George Washington University, Robert
Reed's lab at Cornell University, and Owen McMillan's
lab at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
The postdoc will be expected to lead their research
project and produce rst-author publications, with the
mentorship from the project PIs. The postdoc will also
be encouraged and supported to develop novel research
projects that relate to the goals of the program that
could result in intellectually independent work.
Required qualications: The applicant must have a PhD
or equivalent in a biological sciences discipline, a record
of scholarly publication, and signicant experience work-
ing with genomic datasets in a Unix environment.
Preferred qualications: Strong preference will be given
to applicants with any of the following skills: genome as-
sembly, gene family evolution, and population genomic
analyses.
The project team is committed to increasing diversity in
STEM, and we especially encourage applications from
women, minorities, veterans and other underrepresented
groups.
Application: Please send a single PDF containing a
CV, a statement of research interests, and contact
information for three references to Brian Counter-

AppliedEvolModeling
Postdoc: Modeling Gene Drive and Evolution of Insec-
ticide Resistance in Mosquitoes
OVERVIEW: We recently received funding from NIH for
a project titled \Combining Aedes aegypti genomics and
modeling to improve gene drive strategies and our un-
derstanding of insecticide resistance evolution". Aedes80 EvolDir August 1, 2018
aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, Zika, chikun-
gunya, and urban yellow-fever. This project will fund
two postdocs; one who will do the genomics and bioin-
formatics (individual already identied), and a second
to work on the modeling aspects (this position).
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Although the idea of us-
ing selsh genetic elements to drive specic transgenes
into populations was proposed over 40 years ago, it is
only recently with the advent of CRISPR-based gene
editing technology that this approach has gained broad
attention from researchers and the news media.
The most straightforward approaches for building gene
drives using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are theoreti-
cally expected to result in spread of the gene drive to
individuals in all populations that are connected by
even minimal gene ow. These approaches are appro-
priate in some cases, but detailed mathematical models
are needed to understand the dynamics of spread and
the potential for resistance evolving to the gene drive
mechanisms. More complex approaches have been pro-
posed for developing gene drives that are spatial and/or
temporally limited. More novel molecular approaches
accompanied by modeling are needed for development
of these limited gene drives.
We have funding from the NIH to build mathematical
models aimed at assisting the design and deployment of
gene drives for suppressing or altering the characteristics
of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue virus that
impacts over 100 million people a year. Ae. aegypti has
substantial ne scale population structure but detailed
parameter estimates are lacking. Other work within
the project is focused on accurately estimating these
parameters through genomic approaches.
We currently have a detailed model that simulates the
population dynamics and population genetics of Ae. ae-
gypti in a city on the Amazon river, Iquitos, for which
there are rich data sets on both mosquito dynamics and
dengue epidemiology. The rst main goal of our NIH
grant will be to incorporate the parameter values from
the genomic analysis into the detailed model, and to use
the model for assessing the expected performance of a
variety of gene drive mechanisms in Iquitos and similar
cities.
Insecticides have been used to suppress Ae. aegypti in
Iquitos since 2001. The mosquitoes have responded by
evolving resistance. We are fortunate to have samples
of Ae. aegypti from the year 2001 to the present and
have already begun molecular analysis of signatures of
selection. The second main goal of our NIH grant is
to use the detailed mathematical model to evaluate hy-
potheses about the spatial and temporal dynamics of
insecticide resistance evolution that involves multiplegenes. This work will break new ground in eorts to
control the evolution of insecticide resistance and will
also be informative about the spread of resistance to
gene drives.
JOB DESCRIPTION: The postdoc in this position will
lead modeling eorts to achieve both of the project goals.
In addition to working with our detailed model, the post-
doc will have the option of developing more general mod-
els to evaluate novel approaches to spatially/temporally
limited gene drives and examine impacts of specic gene
drives on dengue virus epidemiology. Our project is
strengthened by collaborations with a number of labs
in the US and in Peru. The postdoc will interact with
members of these other research groups. There will
be an opportunity for some work in Peru. The ini-
tial appointment is for two-years with the potential for
extension beyond that period.
QUALIFICATIONS: We are looking for a postdoc with
a solid background in population biology and popula-
tion genetics who has experience with modeling and
who wants to do applied research. Experience with
C++ or related languages is desirable. Ability to work
independently and as a member of a team is essential.

Postdoctoral position on Genomics and Eco-
Evolutionary Dynamics of Toxic Algal Blooms
An NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available in
the lab of Jennifer Wisecaver at Purdue University to
study the eco-evolutionary genomics of toxin production
in mixotrophic algae. Both the frequency and magni-
tude of toxic algal blooms are increasing across the
globe, yet the genes and pathways responsible for toxin
production as well as the ecological and evolutionary
drivers of bloom events are poorly understood. Much
of the prior genetic and biochemical investigations of
bloom-forming species have been limited to analyses of
laboratory isolates maintained as monocultures despite
growing awareness that algal blooms are diverse assem-
blages. Thus, there is a critical need to quantify the
genetic and toxic diversity present in bloom events as
well as understand how this diversity is maintained in
nature and impacts bloom cycling. The objective of the
project is to determine the functional signicance, in
terms of both toxin production and bloom cycling, of
the biodiversity present in toxic algal blooms. We will
focus on the golden algae Prymnesium parvum (Hapto-
phyceae), an invasive species responsible for ecosystem
disruptive toxic bloom events, causing devastating sh
kills in brackish, inland waters of the United States.
Research activities for a postdoc on this project may
include (but are not limited to): phenotypic characteri-
zation and whole genome sequencing of diverse Prym-
nesium strains, analysis of nucleotide and structural
variation across these strains, culture-based abiotic and
biotic stress experiments, co-expression network analysis
to predict gene function, evolutionary analysis of gene
families and integration of these results with gene expres-
sion networks and phenotypic data. To accomplish these
tasks, the lab is seeking a highly motivated, creative indi-
vidual with some combined experience in computational,
evolutionary, and/or population genomics.
Dr. Wisecaver is committed to increasing STEM par-
ticipation across all measures of diversity, fostering a
positive and collaborative lab environment, and acting
as a mentor and facilitator to enable the career success
of all lab members. A postdoc in the Wisecaver lab
would be a welcome member of a vibrant community
of scientists in the Department of Biochemistry and
the Center for Plant Biology at Purdue. In addition, a82 EvolDir August 1, 2018

network biology & functional genomics to identify the
genes responsible for making specialized metabolites
as well as comparative genomics & phylogenetics to
untangle the genes' evolutionary histories. Questions
we ask include: What are the relative contributions
of innovative processes such as gene duplication, gene
loss, polyploidization, and genome rearrangement in the
origin and diversication of metabolic pathways? What
is the speed and importance of gene innovation at the
regulatory versus enzymatic level? How does the impact
of these processes vary across environments and between
lineages?
The lab has funding to study genes involved in herbivory
defense and other specialized metabolic pathways in Se-
taria viridis, green foxtail, and other wild members of
the genus. Research activities for a postdoc on this
project would include (but are not limited to): perform-
ing plant abiotic and biotic stress experiments, preparing
samples for high-throughput sequencing, developing and
deploying bioinformatic pipelines to predict gene func-
tion, developing new analytical visualization methods
of these data, evolutionary analyses of gene families and
integration of these results with gene expression network
modeling and phenotypic data. To accomplish thesetasks, the lab is seeking a highly motivated, creative
individual with strong computational and evolutionary
genetics skills.
Dr. Wisecaver is committed to increasing STEM par-
ticipation across all measures of diversity, fostering an
encouraging and collaborative lab environment, and
acting as a mentor and facilitator to enable the career
success of all lab members. A postdoc in the Wisecaver
lab would be a welcome member of a vibrant commu-

UArizona OncogenicVirusEvolution
UArizona.OncogenicVirusEvolution
The School of Animal and Comparative Biomedical Sci-
ences is currently seeking a motivated candidate for
the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate. The
successful candidate will design research studies in col-
laboration with physicians, life scientists, or other profes-
sionals, focused broadly on interactions between human
papillomaviruses (HPVs) and host tissues. Specically,
the candidate should have working knowledge of pro-
teomics and genomics methodology and analysis, molec-
ular biology (including DNA cloning).
It is improbable that the ability to cause cancer provides
papillomaviruses with an evolutionary advantage. It is
likely that many of the viral functions linked to onco-
genesis were evolutionarily benecial as papillomavirus
adapted to novel environmental niches on the host (e.g.
external genitalia vs. cervix). Papillomaviruses have
evolved to usurp the cellular machinery to complete their
life-cycle. The papillomaviral lifecycle perturbs the nor-
mal dierentiation cycle of the infected cell, forcing cells
to divide far beyond their normal lifespan. It is feasible
that the continued insult provided by replicating viruses
eventually results in malignant transformation of the
infected cell. However, while persistent infection is key
to viral oncogenesis, many long-term persisting viruses
do not cause cancer. By carefully interrogating the
dierences between these viruses, We believe it will be
possible to elucidate which viral phenotypes are associ-
ated with oncogenic progression. The pathways targeted
by these viruses may represent powerful targets for ther-
apeutic intervention. The successful candidate will be
encouraged to develop their own projects and scientic
direction. More information on the lab can be found at

DiseaseEvolution
Description: From infectious disease ecology, we know
that the magnitude of vertical (from parent to ospring)
vs. horizontal (among unrelated individuals) transmis-
sion can predict pathogen virulence (the harm caused
to the host) and the strength of selection for host resis-
tance or tolerance against pathogens. Despite this, there
has been little focus on how transmission of microbiota
occurs, is maintained, and impacts upon (co)evolution.
This is especially true in the plant literature, despite
decades of evidence for a role of plant- associated mi-
crobiota in shaping plant health. An idea that has been
gaining traction in recent years is that interrupted verti-
cal transmission (for example through C-section delivery
and antibiotic use in infancy) can lead to irreversible
change and/or loss of human microbiome diversity over
time. We are seeking to extend this concept to the plant
microbiome, where common agricultural practices such
as seed treatment, tillage, crop rotation, and chemical
antimicrobials almost certainly result in disrupted mi-
crobiome transmission and could therefore have similar
short and long-term impacts on the host-microbiome
association.
We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to lead an NSF-
funded project exploring the importance of microbiome
transmission mode in shaping adaptation and commu-
nity assembly. The work will take place in the labora-
tory of Dr. Britt Koskella, at UC Berkeley, and will be
in collaboration with Profs Steven Lindow (UC Berke-
ley, Plant and Microbial Biology) and Jessica Metcalf
(Princeton). The project will include a combination of
experimental evolution and bacterial/fungal community
proling/' ^Aomics' ^A approaches, using tomato plants as
a model system.
Responsibilities: Responsibilities include microbiologi-

Description
Description:
The Moorjani Lab (https://moorjanilab.org/) at Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley has a post-doctoral position
available for motivated candidates with background in
statistical population genetics and/or data science.
Our lab focuses on using statistical and computational
approaches to study questions in human genetics and
evolutionary biology. A central aim in the lab is to
understand the impact of evolutionary history on ge-
netic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities:
A successful candidate will develop and apply compu-
tational approaches to large genomic datasets to char-
acterize patterns of population history and evolution.

UCaliforniaIrvine GenomeEvolution
The Emerson lab at UC Irvine (emersonlab.org) is solic-
iting candidates for one or more postdoctoral positions
to study the population genetics and molecular evolu-
tion of genome structure. We have several shovel-ready
data sets and are looking to generate more.
We study how gene duplications, transposable elements,
deletions, and other structural mutations that change
how genomes are organized. We also use patterns of
polymorphism and divergence to explore how natural
selection shapes genome structure. We have generated
a large number of reference-quality genomes within and
between Drosophila species. These high-quality genomes
give us an unprecedented ability to detect and dissect
mutations missed by other approaches. Though we focus
on Drosophila, we're very open to dierent systems and
have worked on E. coli and yeast as well. We are also
currently collaborating on many other projects in other
species, including projects on butteries, mosquitoes,
and sh (see http://emersonlab.org/collaborators/).August 1, 2018 EvolDir 93
Candidates will ideally have interests broadly relevant
to these themes but will also be oered opportunities
to pursue their own interests in evolutionary genetics.
A typical candidate will have a PhD in the following
or related elds: evolutionary genetics, bioinformat-
ics, computational biology, statistics, or experimental
genomics (especially long molecule sequencing). If in
doubt, get in touch!
The Emerson lab is aliated with the department of
Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, the Center for Com-

The rice project concerns an ongoing burst in copy num-
ber of a TE in several strains and its impact on the
genome and epigenome (K. Naito et al, Nature 2009 461:
131; Lu Lu et al, PNAS 2017 114(49) E10550-E10559).
This work will involve analysis of high throughput whole
genome sequencing using Illumina technology to exam-
ine the genomes of hundreds of recombinant inbred lines.
The citrus project involves the continued development
and annotation of a high-quality reference genome us-
ing long-read technology and comparative genomics toexamine dierences among citrus varieties. For the
teaching component the successful candidate will design
authentic research experiences based on the rice and
citrus projects for rst year students enrolled in the DG
course. This position requires a commitment to inno-
vative teaching along with excellent bioinformatics and
programming skills to analyze and synthesize genome
assemblies, identify polymorphisms, and perform quan-
titative trait mapping.
Applications will be accepted until the position is lled
and review will begin on August 15, 2018. Salary and
benets are commensurate with NSF guidelines and the
University of California Postdoctoral Union agreement.
Qualications Minimum qualications include a Ph.D.
in Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Statistics, or
a related eld. Demonstrated experience in bioinformat-
ics and high prociency in programming is necessary
along with an understanding of the mechanisms and
methods of studying population and evolutionary biol-
ogy. Experience with next generation sequence data is
highly desirable. Ability to communicate clearly, work
independently, and interact collaboratively is essential.

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to work in a
collaborative project between the research groups of Dr.
Castellano and Dr. Kilpinen. The aim of the project
is to understand how genetic variation, common and
rare, aects molecular phenotypes in human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and neuronal cell types
derived from them, and how this aects the use of iP-
SCs as models for rare genetic diseases. The project
builds on resources and results from the Human Induced
Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (www.hipsci.org). The
successful candidate will analyse genetic, transcriptomic
and epigenetic data from these cells to investigate molec-
ular dierences in disease phenotypes arising from their
genetic background. The ultimate goal of the project is
to improve the accuracy of iPSC-based disease models
and enable clinically relevant ndings.
We are seeking a creative and highly motivated indi-
vidual with prime interest in genomics. Candidates
should have a PhD in bioinformatics, computational
or evolutionary biology, statistics or related genomic
disciplines. The ideal candidate will have experience in
at least one of the areas above, and a strong interest
in the others. Previous work in translational bioinfor-
matics (theoretical or analytical) is a plus. Experience
with large-scale genomic datasets and databases, next-
generation sequencing data, and strong programming
and quantitative skills are required.
University College London (UCL) is London' ^As leading
multidisciplinary university. In the recent 2014 Research
Excellence Framework (REF2014) UCL was rated the
top university in the UK for research strength and the
best research environment. The Genetics and Genomics
Medicine Programme, within the Great Ormond Street
Institute of Child Health at UCL, is a lively, stimulating,
and highly collaborative place in the forefront of rare
disease research. The programme is very international
and its genomics section is moving in 2018 to the new
and adjacent Zayed Centre for Research into Rare Dis-
ease in Children. The successful candidate will also have
the opportunity to contribute bioinformatics approaches
to UCL Genomics. The position will be part-funded by
the GOSH-BRC.

UHelsinki Evodevo
Post-doc in mathematical modeling in development and
experimental evolution:
1.Job/ project description:
The research will involve using and rening an existing
mathematical model of wing morphogenesis to explore
whether it can be used to predict how wing morphol-
ogy changes over generations in an articial selection
experiment. These predictions would be contrasted
with predictions stemming from a quantitative genetics
analysis of y populations.
The research will take place in the Center of Excellence
in Experimental and computational developmental biol-
ogy of the Biotechnology Institute of the University of
Helsinki, Finland.
The job is for 1 year and renewable for 1 extra year.
2. Background:
Why organisms are the way they are?
Can we understand the processes by which complexorganisms are build in each generation and how these
evolved?
The process of embryonic development is now widely ac-
knowledged to be crucial to understand evolution since
any change in the phenotype in evolution (e.g. morphol-
ogy) is rst a change in the developmental process by
which this phenotype is produced. Over the years we
have come to learn that there is a set of developmental
rules that determine which phenotypic variation can
possibly arise in populations due to genetic mutation
(the so called genotype-phenotype map). Since natural
selection can act only on existing phenotypic variation,
these rules of development have an eect on the direction
of evolutionary change.
Our group is devoted to understand these developmental
rules and how these can help to better understand the
direction of evolutionary change. The ultimate goal is
to modify evolutionary theory by considering not only
natural selection in populations but also developmen-
tal biology in populations. For that aim we combine
mathematical models of embryonic development that
relate genetic variation to morphological variation with
population models. The former models are based on
what is currently known in developmental biology.
There are two traditional approaches to study pheno-
typic evolution. One is quantitative genetics and one
is developmental evolutionary biology. The former is
based in the statistics of the association between ge-
netic relatedness and phenotypic variation between in-
dividuals in populations, the latter in the genetic and
bio-mechanical manipulation of the development of lab
individuals. While the former models trait variation
with an statistical linear approach the latter models it by
deterministic non-linear models of gene networks and tis-
sue bio-mechanics. For the most, these two approaches
are largely isolated from each other.
The current project aims to contrast and put together
these two approaches in a specic easy to study system:
the y wing. In brief, we are growing y populations
and, in each generation, we select the founders of the
next generation based on how close they resemble an
arbitrary optimal morphology in their wings (based on
the proportions between several of their traits). In each
generation also, we estimate the G matrix and the selec-
tion gradient to see how well one can predict evolution
in the next generation. The quantitative genetics predic-
tions will be contrasted with the predictions stemming
from a wing morphogenesis model that we built based
on our current understanding of wing developmental
biology (see Dev Cell. 2015 Aug 10;34(3):310-22 for
the model and for slightly similar approaches: Nature.
2013 May 16;497(7449):361-4. and Nature. 2010 MarAugust 1, 2018 EvolDir 99
25;464(7288):583-6).
Our center of excellence includes groups working in
tooth, wing, hair and mammary glands development. In
addition to evolutionary and developmental biologists
the center of excellence includes bioinformaticians, pop-
ulational and quantitative geneticists, systems biologists
and paleontologists. The group leaders of the center
involved in this project are Salazar-Ciudad and Shimmi.
'The Academy of Finland's Centres of Excellence are the
agships of Finnish research. They are close to or at the
very cutting edge of science in their elds, carving out
new avenues for research, developing creative research
environments and training new talented researchers for
the Finnish research system.'
3. Requirements:
The applicant must hold a PhD in either evolutionary
biology, developmental biology or, preferably, in evolu-
tionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Applicants
with a PhD in theoretical or mathematical biology are
also welcome.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.
The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.

The fellowship will be for a period of up to 1+1 years
(100% research work: no teaching involved).
Salary according to Finnish postdoc salaries.

UOxford HostParasiteInteractions
Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Host-Parasite Inter-
actions
Salary: Grade 7.1 31,604
A full-time, 24-month position is available in the King
Lab at the University of Oxford, Department of Zoology
to work on host-parasite interactions. The post-holder
will use experimental evolution to examine whether and
how mixed species coinfections with natural bacterial
parasites (isolated on banana leaves in Africa) can shape
the evolution of resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans ne-
matode hosts. Interestingly, environmental conditions,
as well as the presence of a second parasite species, can
aect the outcome of infection. This project will track
the spread of resistance in host populations in an evolu-
tion experiment using compost microcosms. Detailed
investigations of host evolutionary dynamics here will
greatly contribute to our understanding of the sweeping
impacts of parasite biodiversity, across space and time.
This post is suited to researchers who have experi-
ence with evolutionary biology, C elegans, microbiology,
and/or host-parasite interactions. The postholder will
be given the opportunity to contribute to the develop-
ment and direction of this project. Thus, this position
is ideally suited for ambitious researchers, who are in-
dependent, but also enjoy working in a team. The
successful candidate will hold a doctoral degree (or near
completion) in a relevant subject area.
The position will start January 2019.
Only applications made online before 12.00 midday (UK
time) on 8 August 2018 will be considered. You will be
required to upload your CV and supporting statement.

UStirling BuzzPollination
Postdocs on Buzz Pollination
A 12-month postdoctoral position, with the possibility
of extension to 36 months, is available for a Leverhulme
Trust funded project on the ecology and evolution of
buzz pollination at the Vallejo-Marin Lab, University
of Stirling, UK. The project will support two postdocs,
each specialising on either ower or bee perspectives
of buzz pollination, but who will work collaboratively
using functional analyses of the vibrational properties of
owers, bee behavioural experiments, and eld surveys
in the tropics.The postdocs will form part of a 3-year project funded
by the Leverhulme Trust, entitled \Buzz pollination:
Integrating bee behaviour and oral evolution". The
project is a collaboration between Dr. Mario Vallejo-
Marin (Plant Evolution and Pollination, Stirling), Prof.
Fernando Montealegre-Zapata (Bioacoustics and Sen-
sory Biology, U. Lincoln) and Dr. Gema Martin-Ordas
(Psychology, Stirling).
Buzz pollination, in which bees use high frequency vi-
brations to extract pollen from owers with specialised
morphologies, occurs in more than 22,000 species of ow-
ering plants, including some crops. Despite being known
for more than 100 years, many fundamental questions in
buzz pollination remain unanswered. The two postdocs
will join an ambitious project to link oral morphology
and the vibrational characteristics of owers with bee
behaviour and cognition to determine how oral and
bee characteristics aect buzz pollination. Each post-
doc will specialise on either ower or bee perspectives
of buzz pollination, but both will work collaboratively
using functional analyses of the vibrational properties of
owers, bee behavioural experiments, and eld surveys
in the tropics.
DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES: The appointee will be
expected to contribute to the intellectual development
of the project, including participating in analysis and
write-up of papers describing the work. In addition, the
appointed researcher will participate in project meetings,
and help supervise undergraduate and MSc students
working on related research.
. Postdoctoral researcher on the vibration properties
of buzz-pollinated owers: The appointed postdoc will
estimate vibrational properties of owers using a variety
of tools including laser scanners and micro CT scanning.
The postdoc will relate empirical measurements of ow-
ers and vibrations to test hypotheses of the function of
oral structures, oversee the growth and maintenance of
plants to ensure sucient availability of ower material
at Stirling, and conduct eld work in Mexico/Brazil.
. Postdoctoral researcher on the behaviour and cogni-
tion of buzz-pollinating bees: The appointed postdoc
will analyse the relationship between bee morphology,
behaviour and cognition, and the characteristics of vi-
brations produced by bees. The postdoc will carry
out extensive experiments of bee behaviour under con-
trolled laboratory conditions to test hypotheses on bee
cognition, learning and vibrations produced by bees.
Vibrational properties will be measured with a variety
of tools including acoustic analysis, laser vibrometry
and direct-contact motion sensors. The postdoc will
need to provide support for plant growth to generate ex-
perimental owers, as well as to create articial modelsAugust 1, 2018 EvolDir 105
using, among other tools, 3D printing. The postdoc will
oversee the maintenance of bumblebee colonies and work
with bees daily, and conduct eldwork in Mexico/Brazil.
The appointee will be part of a thriving research envi-
ronment within Biological and Environmental Sciences
(BES) with more than 40 principal investigators, along-
side postdoctoral researchers and 60 PhD students. The
post is based in Stirling, but postdocs will conduct short
research visits to the Bioacoustics and Sensory Biology
lab of Prof. Montealegre-Zapata for data collection,
project planning and paper writing.
SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS: PhD in a rele-
vant discipline (see full job description). The appointed
candidate must be creative, organised and independent,
self-motivated, able to communicate well, work collabo-
ratively in a team, and able to conduct repetitive tasks
precisely and carefully. Knowledge of oral morphology
and evolution, pollination, strong numerical skills, and
a background in biophysics (Floral Vibrations Postdoc)
or knowledge of insect behaviour, experience at working
with bees, pollination, and strong numerical skills (Bee
Behaviour Postdoc), are an asset.
SALARY: These are Grade 7 positions, with an annual
salary of 32,548 - 38,833 p.a. Fixed Term Contract for
12 months, full-time, with the possibility to be extended
to 36 months, pending a rst-year progress review of
the appointee.
KEY DATES: We will begin reviewing applications on
23 August, and continue until the position is lled. In-
terviews will be held on 18-19 September. The date for
the start of both posts is 1 January 2019.

mcmaster.ca/~brian/evoldir.htmlUWisconsin Madison
EvolutionaryGenomics
The research group of John Pool at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison invites applications for a postdoc-
toral research position. We have multiple opportunities
for projects to work on, with an overarching theme
of addressing big questions in population/evolutionary
genetics. Rather than lling a pre-dened role, our
top priority is to recruit the best scientist and identify
shared research interests.
Potential research areas could include:
* The Genetic Architecture of Adaptive Evolution When
traits evolve in nature, we'd like to understand how many
genes are involved, whether selection acts on standing
variation or new mutations, whether it ultimately xes
the causative variants, and the predictability of genetic
architecture across populations that evolve the same
trait changes in parallel. Our focus on local adapta-
tion among Drosophila melanogaster populations from
contrasting natural environments provides a powerful
and ecient system for addressing these questions. Po-
tential projects could range from statistical methods
(e.g. testing theoretical predictions about the distribu-
tion of eect sizes of adaptive variants) to experimental
approaches (e.g. using RNAseq to extend our under-
standing of adaptive trait evolution).
* The Genetic Architecture of Rapid (Partial) Reproduc-
tive Isolation Partial prezygotic and postzygotic isola-
tion exists between African and European populations,
which diverged only ~10 kya but now occupy very dif-
ferent environments. I've found that natural admixture
between these populations resulted in a genome-wide
abundance of \ancestry disequilibrium" (non-random
two-locus genotypes at unlinked loci) suggestive of in-
compatibilities between African and European alleles.
Our lab is mapping incompatibilities related to viability
and fertility. There is an opportunity to add a model
inference approach aimed at broader questions regarding
the number and strength of epistatically-interacting loci
that separate these recently-diverged populations.
* Measuring Genetic Diversity to Predict Adaptive Po-
tential Standing genetic variation provides the fastest
route for populations to adapt to rapid environmental
change. Both within-population variation and between-
population adaptive dierentiation may contribute rawAugust 1, 2018 EvolDir 107
material to future evolution, and we're interested in
testing the relative contributions of these sources. But
even more, we are interested in developing methods
that speak to the relative adaptive potential of dier-
ent populations and dierent combinations of them, as
indicated by their patterns of genomic diversity and pop-
ulation genetic estimates of the total level of adaptive
dierentiation between populations.
* Fundamental Population Genomics We are interested
in leveraging data (such as our lab's Drosophila Genome
Nexus), simulation, and statistical/computational meth-
ods to ask basic population genetic questions. Examples
could include new angles on the classic but unresolved
controversy over the relative roles of selective sweeps
and background selection, and the relative roles of hard
and soft sweeps on autosomes and the X chromosome.
I also encourage lab members to develop their own
project ideas, and I am quite open to letting postdocs
take important portions of our lab's research program
with them when they found new research groups.
Our research group was founded 7 years ago and
currently consists of the PI, 1 postdoc, 5 PhD
students, and six undergraduate researchers. I have
also advised 4 former postdocs, and the publication
records of Amir Yassin and Justin Lack show what a
productive environment our lab can be for postdocs.

Postdoctoral Position: Evolutionary Genomics and
Adaptation in Invasive Mosquitoes of Medical impor-
tance
A postdoctoral position is available in the Caccone lab
in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at Yale University. The postdoc will work within a
recently awarded 5 years NIH project aimed at using
evolutionary genetic principles and methods to under-
stand the phylogeography, range expansion, and climatic
adaptation of a medically important disease vector, the
invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus.
The main goals of the project are to: 1) use whole-
genome sequence data from thousands of individuals
worldwide to determine the evolutionary history of
the species range expansion, 2) develop a SNP-chip
to rapidly genotype samples for a variety of scopes such
as identifying the origin of new invasive populations or
characterize allelic variation at genes of interest, such
as insecticide resistance or vector competence, and 3)
identify the genetic basis of the species ability to adapt
to cooler climates using methods to look at genotype-
phenotype associations and selection.
Dr Caccone is also the director of a training and re-
search center (https://cgab.yale.edu/) sponsored by the
YIBS Institute (https://yibs.yale.edu/), where a variety
of evolutionary genetics/genomics projects on a variety

GenomeAssemblyandAnnotation
Feb11-15
Dear all,
we are pleased to inform you that we will run the 2nd
edition of our \Assembly and Annotation of genomes"
course from the 11th to the 15th of February 2019, in
Berlin (Germany)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course20/ Application deadline is: January 10 ^th,
2019.
Instructor:
Dr. Thomas D. Otto (University of Glasgow, UK;
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t28/)
Assistant instructor:
Mr. Maximilian Driller (Begendiv, Germany; http://-
bit.ly/2zcwmQT)
Overview
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the concepts of de novo assembly and anno-
tation. Dierent technologies, from Illumina, PacBio,
Oxford Nanopoor and maybe 10X will be used mixed
with dierent approaches like correction, HiC scaolding
to generate good draft assemblies. Particular attention
will be given to the quality control of the assemblies
and to the understanding how errors occur. Further,
annotation tools using RNA-Seq data will be introduced.
An outlook of potential analysis is given. In the end of
the course the students should be able to understand
what is needed to generate a good annotated genome.August 1, 2018 EvolDir 113
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learning
more about genome assembly and annotation. It will
include information useful for both the beginner and
the more advanced user. We will start by introducing
general concepts and then continue to step-by-step de-
scribe all major components of a genome assembly and
annotation workow, from raw data all the way to a
nal assembled and annotated genome. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
command line Linux.
Attendees should have a background in biology. We
will dedicate one session to some basic and advanced
Linux concepts. Attendees should have also some famil-
iarity with genomic data such as that arising from NGS
sequencers.
Session content Monday 12th - Classes from 09:30 to
17:30 - \get it starting"
Session 1: Introduction (morning)
In this session I will kick o with an introduction lec-
ture about genome assembly and annotation - the past,
the present and the future. I will use this introduction
to motivate the ve-day course. Next, I will explain
the use of the virtual machine (VM), and the use of
cloud computing. This is followed by short introduction
to Linux. Through the morning we will kick o our
rst assembly and put it through an annotation tool
(Companion).
Session 2: Visualization (half afternoon)
During this afternoon, we are going to visualize the
assembled and annotation genome from this morning
in Artemis. The aim is to use the viewer to inspect the
annotation, correct annotation and write out les. Next,
we are going to perform a comparative exercise, (compar-
ing the genome from the morning with a close reference)
to understand the concept of syntheny, breakpoint or
errors.
Session 3: Mapping
In this module, I will teach the basics of read mapping.
We will map reads with bwa mem onto a reference and
will examine duplications and errors through not proper
mapped read pairs. This is important to exanimate
the correctness of assemblies and will be used later the
week.
Tuesday 13th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \learn it
the old way"
Session 4: De Brujin graph and PAGIT
This module is dedicated to short read assembly. Al-
though it might be superseded due to long reads, under-standing the concept of short reads and De Brujin graph
is crucial. After a seminar about this subject, we will
assemble the same genome as before, but this time with
Illumina: de novo assembly with velvet, contig ordering,
error correction. Through comparative genomics we are
going to look at errors in the assembly, and how they
could be found with remapping short reads, and also
split long reads. Last, we are going to compare the
assembly to the assembly from Monday. This session
will go into the afternoon of Tuesday.
Session 5: RNA-Seq
In this session, we will analysis the transcriptome of the
sample we assembled so far, motivated through a little
talk. In the exercise, we will map RNA-Seq reads, (short
and long reads) understanding rst the basics of RNA-
Seq, but then will use the reads to correct gene models.
We will discuss the concept of alternative splicing.
Finally, we will annotate our assembly with Augustus,
using the mapped RNA-Seq data and some manually
corrected genes.
Wednesday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \do it
yourself"
Session 6: Large genome assembly
First we are going to kick o an assembly of a larger
genome, and let it run in the cloud over the day and
the night. It will be important during the day to check
if the assembly is still running.

8thDNAmetabarcodingSchool
Oct4-11
Dear colleagues,
The registration deadline for the eighth DNA metabar-
coding Spring School in French Guiana has been ex-
tended to August the 3rd. Below the description of
the school. For more information please consult the
following web page: http://metabarcoding.org/A88 <
http://metabarcoding.org/A88 >
All the best.
For the organisation committee.
DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method for as-
sessing biodiversity from environmental DNA and bulk
samples. It has a wide range of applications: biodiver-
sity monitoring, animal diet assessment, reconstruction
of paleo communities, among others. DNA metabarcod-
ing uses molecular techniques such as PCR and next
generation sequencing, and requires a broad range of
skills, as it integrates molecular biology, bioinformatics,
biostatistics, and ecology.August 1, 2018 EvolDir 115
The DNA metabarcoding spring school is now in its
eighth edition. This year, it is co-organized by the
metabarcoding.org team and the Center for the Study
of Biodiversity in Amazonia (CEBA) at the Nouragues
Scientic Station in French Guiana
The DNA metabarcoding spring school will be held from
October 4th to 11th, 2018
The school will be divided into lectures and practicals.
All the lectures and the practicals will be taught in
English The number of participants to this school is
limited to 16.
Candidates can apply for the school by sending an email
to the following address :
nouragues2018@metabarcoding.org
The email must contain a brief curriculum vitae and a
letter of motivation indicating how the applicant's re-
search will benet from DNA metabarcoding and what
(s)he is hoping to learn from this school. As part of the
course, each participant will have to give a ash talk (5
minutes) about their research and how it is related to
DNA metabarcoding.
Main lecturers - Fr ed eric Boyer (LECA, CNRS, France) -
Eric Coissac (LECA, UGA, France) - Eric Marcon (Eco-
Fog, AgroParisTech, France) - Pierre Taberlet (LECA,
CNRS, France) - Heidy Schimann (EcoFog, INRA,
France) - Lucie Zinger (IBENS, ENS, France)
Course Schedule
The lectures will cover dierent aspects of DNA metabar-
coding. The bioinformatics practicals will introduce
data analysis from raw sequences to basic ecological con-
clusions. The molecular ecology practical will present
basic techniques for DNA extraction in the eld and
DNA amplication by PCR.
Venue
The school will take place at the Nouragues Scientic
Station, in the middle of the Amazonian forest in French
Guiana.
This location has accommodation for all participants in
\carbet". This is not a classical hotel with all the associ-
ated services. You will have to bring your hamac and
mosquito net. For details on how to ll your luggages
(clothes, shoes, insect repellants, etc.), carefully read the
Nouragues web site (http://www.nouragues.cnrs.fr/).
Attendees will be taken in charge at the Cayenne city
center and will be transported to the eld station by
pirogues or helicopters. Therefore it will no be possible
to arrive after the beginning of the school or to leave
before the end.For leaving the eld station at the end of the school, a
four hours walk to reach the river will have to be done.
Cost of the school:
The return trip between Cayenne and the eld station,
the fees to stay at the eld station including the meals
and the lecture cost are taken in charge by the school
organisation. Participants have to pay for their trip up
to Cayenne and for their stay in Cayenne before and
after the school.
To get there:
The appointment for the trip to the Nouragues eld
station is set on October the 4th early in the morning.
Therefore attendees will have to be at Cayenne at least
the day before. Participants will have to reach Cayenne
on their own.
Direct ight are available daily from Paris to the
Cayenne-F elix Ebou e Airport. The two major com-
panies oering these ights are : Air Cara bes and Air
France. Other ights are also available from few cities.
The following link resume the main international con-
nections to Cayenne.
For some countries, France requires a Schenguen entry
visa, to be arranged before the travel.

Supercomputing for Everyone Series: de novo assembly
of transcriptomes using HPC resources workshop
The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NC-
GAS) at Indiana University seeks interested participants
for this FREE National Science Foundation-sponsored
two-day workshop.
Registration page: http://go.iu.edu/21IC NCGAS is of-
fering a National Science Foundation-sponsored, two-day116 EvolDir August 1, 2018
workshop on high performance computing (HPC) usage
and de novo transcriptome assembly. It will take place
October 1-2 on the IU Bloomington campus. There are
limited spots on October 3 to have one-on-one consul-
tation sessions with NCGAS Sta. Registration is free,
but application is required.
The workshop will include discussions, lectures, and
hands-on tutorials to cover topics important to get-
ting started constructing and analyzing transcriptomes-
without the use of a ?genome. Material covers both the
availability and use of HPC resources, alongside the task
of assembling a new transcriptome, in order to provide
a more comprehensive preparation for this and future
bioinformatic tasks.
Transcriptome assembly will consist of using four sepa-
rate assemblers (Trinity, SOAP de novo, Velvet Oases,
and TransABySS), with multiple kmers, to be com-
bined and curated with Evigenes. This combined as-
sembly with multiple parameters is considered much
more robust than simply using one assembler, and the
NCGAS pipeline streamlines the process and allows for
customization if desired.
While material will make heavy use of XSEDE and IU
machines, the material is transferable to any cluster.

polyploids.html Objectives: Polyploidy is widespread
and frequent in plants (including many crops), but
also occurs in animals such as sh and amphibians.
However, our understanding of the genetics of polyploid
populations and populations of mixed ploidy is still
poor. This is mainly because population genetics
theory was originally developed for diploids. Moreover,
there is often a gap between theory developed for
polyploids and its practical implementation. This
practically-oriented course will attempt to bridge this
gap. Simulation-based exercises (among others using R)
will elucidate theoretical foundations of both diploid and
polyploid population genetics. Additionally, analyses of
real or realistic example datasets (microsatellite and
SNP markers) will give participants hands-on training
in several available methods for the population genetic
analysis of polyploids.
The exact course contents are not cast in stone, but will
include clustering methods with specic attention for
the problem of mixed ploidy, evolutionary history recon-
struction of polyploid complexes, the eect of mating
system variation, and detection of linked selection in
polyploid genomes. Participants will also devote time
to a group project focused on application of gathered
knowledge in further modelling or on analyses of sample
or own datasets and discussion of further prospects and
methods limitations.
Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of R programming lan-
guage and general knowledge of population genetic foun-
dations of diploid populations (diversity, dierentiation,inbreeding). Experience in scripting in R is useful, but
for the beginners there will be an extra R-introductory
day before the workshop start.
Costs: course participation is free (!) and includes food
and accommodation, but travel arrangements are at
own cost. Please apply to participate using the link to
the registration form on

Postgraduate Course on 'Linking Community and
Ecosystem Dynamics'
This is the rst announcement of the winter school
for PhD students and Postdocs on Linking Commu-
nity and Ecosystem Dynamics organized by Research
School Ecology & Evolution of the Groningen Institutefor Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES; University of
Groningen, Netherlands).
The school will be held in the University eld station
'De Herdershut' on the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog
from October 21 - 26 2018.
Scope of the course
The research elds community and ecosystem ecology
have diverged more or less independently over the last
decennia. In community ecology progress is made in
understanding shifts in community composition under
the inuence of environmental change and how these
shifts can be explained by functional trait approaches
of component species. Also, the importance of positive
feedbacks in community dynamics is more and more
appreciated, and merged with trophic interactions in
ecological networks. Studies in ecosystem ecology tra-
ditionally have a strong focus on energy and nutrient
uxes and how deviation in these uxes aect ecosystem
functioning and stability. Recent studies reveal tight
links between these sub-disciplines that enforce us to
rethink how communities and ecosystems interact.
This course focuses on theoretical concepts, such as au-
tocatalytic loops and positive and negative feedbacks
between organisms in ecological networks, as well as the
importance of non-trophic interactions by ecosystem
engineers. The course will address how these principles
can be used to link communities to ecosystems enabling
a better understanding of how environmental changes
aect community and ecosystem dynamics. Students
will construct ecological networks of their own study
system or based on literature data and analyze these
using structural equation modelling.
Course Set-up
The course is composed of a series of lectures, a poster
session, analysing ecological networks using structural
equation modelling and nalized with a debating session.
Poster session: Prior to the course, participants submit
a poster of their work (A4-size) in PDF, which will be
printed and included in the course reader. The poster
contains name and aliation, title and short descrip-
tion of research project (including concepts) with one
highlight (something exciting) and the reason you want
to participate in this course. During the course, partic-
ipants briey pitch their research (maximum 3 slides)
and indicate where they would like to receive input from
the course participants and lecturers.
Lectures and discussion: Each day starts with a key
speaker who will give a lecture on one of the key course
topics (covering both general theory and own research).
After lecture a discussion which is convened by three120 EvolDir August 1, 2018
participants who challenge the speaker on the lecture
and two papers that the speaker submitted which are re-
lated to the topic of the lecture (participants will receive
these before the course to prepare them self).
Group activities: In the afternoons, participants will
be split into working groups, which will work on spe-
cic group assignments associated with the topic of the
course (design ecological networks and analysing these).
The exact topics of these activities will be selected by
the participants. Each group will present the results
to all course participants the following day. Group ac-
tivities will be supervised by the lecturers and course
organizers (which are present the whole course), so that
the students can optimally benet from experts that are
among the leaders in their elds.
Debating session: We will debate propositions that have
been brought forward by speakers, students or have
appeared to be a point of discussion during the course.
Course lecturers include Prof. Neil Rooney (U. of
Guelph), Prof. Han Ol (U. of Groningen), Prof. Matty
Berg (Free University Amsterdam), Prof. Tjeerd Bouma
(Netherlands Institute for Sea Research).

Reproducible data science for population genetics
(RDPG02)
This course is being delivered by Dr Thibaut Jombart
and Dr Zhian Kamvar (authors of the Adgenet package
which will focus heavily in the course) from the 11th -
15th February 2019 in Glasgow City Centre
Course Overview: With the increasing availability of
various types of genetic and genomic data, population
genetics and molecular ecology are becoming largely
data driven sciences. Understanding the evolutionary,
demographic, and ecological underpinning the geneticmakeup of natural populations now relies on a com-
bination of exploratory approaches and models. This
course will provide an in-depth introduction to these
techniques, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility
though the use of modern analytic practices and tools.
After an introduction to phylogenetic reconstruction, the
course will cover a number of multivariate approaches
for the analysis of genetic patterns, including super-
vised and unsupervised factorial methods, clustering
approaches, and advanced methods for describing popu-
lation diversity and revealing spatial genetic patterns.
The approaches introduced will be applicable to most
genetic data, including markers such as microsatellites,
SNPs, or AFLP, as well as nucleotide and amino-acid
sequence data. Every day will start with a lecture ded-
icated to a type of problem and methods, followed by
an introduction to a specic technique for reproducible
data analysis; afternoon will be devoted to hands on
praticals. The last day will be devoted to open prob-
lems, where participants will be able to analyse their
own data.
Intended Audience The course is aimed at PhD stu-
dents, research postgraduates, and practicing academics
as well as persons in industry working with genetic data
in elds such as molecular ecology, evolutionary biology,
and phylogenetics.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.August 1, 2018 EvolDir 123
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
