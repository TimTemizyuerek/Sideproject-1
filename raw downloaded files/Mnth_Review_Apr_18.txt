Asilomar MolluscEvolution
Dear all
The next World Congress of Malacology will be in Asilo-
mar conference grounds, Pacic Grove, California. The
congress is organised by Unitas Malacologica in con-
junction with the American Malacological Society, the
Western Society of Malacologists, and our other partner
societies. Asilomar is a stunning location and we are
excited to welcome you there.
We are now seeking proposals for thematic symposia
within the conference. The meeting includes all sci-
ence done using any molluscs as subjects, as well as
organismal biology of the molluscs themselves. Deadline
for proposals is 1 May. http://forms.calacademy.org/-
wcm2019 We are particularly interested in symposiumtopics that embrace (actually or theoretically) multiple
molluscan classes. We ask you to suggest a few speakers,
as indicative of the breadth of the topic. We will not
contact any suggested speakers without your permission.
We expect symposia to last a half day or full day, but if
you think your topic would extend beyond a day that's
also welcome. The selected symposia are not being
oered any funding support (we're sorry) but will be
advertised prominently in the run up to abstract sub-
mission and registration, and we are happy help you
recruit outside sponsorship for your symposium.
We also particularly encourage participation by early ca-
reer scientists and international members as symposium
organisers.
On behalf of the scientic programme committee, I am
looking forward to your symposium ideas!
Here's the link to the online form again - deadline 1 May

Conference: ' Ecological Immunology in Butteries, and
underlying mechanisms'
Dear Colleagues,
Please see below information detailing the upcoming
symposium \Ecological Immunology in Butteries, and
underlying mechanisms" to be held during the 8th Biol-
ogy of Butteries Conference, Bangalore, India, on June
11th to 14th. Both the symposium and the conference
aim to attract researchers from the elds of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology.
Butteries face challenges from wide range of organisms,
from pathogenic fungi, viruses, and bacteria, to endo-
and ecto-parasitoid wasps. An eective immune system
is, hence, crucial. Activation of an immune response is,
however, costly, and interactions with pathogens and
parasites most likely have great tness consequences
on the buttery hosts. Such adaptations may include
modications in the hosts' immune strategies, fecundity,
behaviours or other life-history traits.
This symposium aims to bring together people work-
ing on dierent facets of buttery immunity. We will
present the latest research on immune reactions, and
the fundamental trade-os between the investment into
immune functions and other costly life-history traits in
butteries, using tool-boxes from molecular biology to
ecology.
The invited speakers include: Prof. Jacobus de Roode,
Emory University, USA. Prof. de Roode's interests in-
clude how the host plant diet aects disease outcome in
butteries. (http://deroodelab.org/)
Dr. Christopher Wheat, Stockholm University, Swe-
den. Dr. Wheat will present his research on
the microevolutionary selection dynamics acting on
immune genes of the green veined white buttery,
Pieris napi. (http://www.zoologi.su.se/en/about/sta/-
person.php?suuid=cwhea)The Conference organiser, and symposium organisers,
Dr. Marjo Saastamoinen and Dr. Anne Duplouy now
welcome abstracts through the online registration form
for both talk and poster contributions from anyone and
any career level.
Please nd all details about the conference, in-

MolecularEvolution Jul19-29
Founded in 1988, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution
is the longest-running workshop if its kind. The 2018
workshop will be held July 19-29, and this will be its30th anniversary at the Marine Biological Lab in Woods
Hole, MA. The Workshop is the premier program for
integrating the methods, theory, and applications of
molecular phylogenetics, statistical genetics, molecular
evolution, and related disciplines. Students work closely
with internationally-recognized scientists, receiving (i)
high-level instruction in the principles of molecular evo-
lution and evolutionary genomics, (ii) advanced training
in statistical methods best suited to modern datasets,
and (iii) hands-on experience with the latest software
tools (often from the authors of the programs they are
using). The material is delivered via lectures, discus-
sions, and bioinformatic exercises motivated by contem-
porary topics in molecular evolution. A hallmark of this
workshop is the direct interaction between students and
eld-leading scientists. The workshop serves graduate
students, postdocs, and established faculty from around
the world seeking to apply the principles of molecular
evolution to questions of both basic and applied biologi-
cal sciences. A priority of this workshop is to foster an
environment where students can learn from each other
as well from the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to use
the following software to address questions concern-
ing the origins, maintenance, and function of molec-
ular variation: ASTRAL, BEAST2, BEST, FASTA,
FigTree, GARLI, IQTree, MIGRATE, MAFFT, MP-
EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML, PAUP*, SNaQ, and
SVD Quartets. Students will have the opportunity to
work with software on their own laptops as well as re-
ceive training on how to use the same programs on a
high performance computer cluster.
In 2018 the course instructors include C ecile An e, Pe-
ter Beerli, Joseph Bielawski, Belinda Chang, Casey
Dunn, Scott Edwards, Laure Eme, Deise Josely Pereira
Gon calves, Tracy Heath, Mark Holder, John Huelsen-

Subject: Montpellier.HARLANIII OriginOfAgricultureandGR.Sept11-
14. Third Jack R. Harlan International Symposium
Dedicated
to the Origins of Agriculture and the Domestication,
Evolution,
and Utilization of Genetic Resources
https://sites.google.com/site/harlan3symposium2018
Montpellier will have the honor of hosting the Third
Jack R Harlan International Symposium on the Ori-
gins of Agriculture and Domestication, evolution and
utilization of genetic resources.
The Harlan Symposium was created by the University
of California (UC Davis, USA) as a tribute to Jack R.
Harlan, who was an American botanist and agronomist
(1917-1998). J.R. Harlan was a pioneer in the study of
origin agriculture and crops, showing the importance of
the relationship between the activity from human de-
velopment and the evolution of agricultural biodiversity.His most famous book \Crops and Man", 1975, remains
a reference and has been the bedside book of generations
students in plant breeding, especially in France, where
J.R. Harlan's inuence was very strong in the scientic
community dealing with plant genetic resources.
On invitation of the UC Davis, the Montpellier scientic
community has applied in 2016 for the third edition of
the Harlan Symposium, a prestigious, recurrent but rare
event, organized in 1997 and 2008. This application
was selected after a competitive process. The originality
of the Harlan symposium lies in the multidisciplinary
aspects of the science (from archeology to genetics and
agroecology), the variety of biological models (plants,
animals, microorganisms) and the broad temporal scale
(from the origin of agriculture to the current problems
of use of agricultural biodiversity). The Third Harlan
Symposium will be inuenced by the research thematics
of the South countries, given the Mediterranean and
tropical orientation of the research teams involved.

UGottingen SensationEvolution
Sep27-28
Dear colleagues, PIs and students,
the GOEvol consortium proudly presents its 6th meet-
ing #Sensation @GOEEvolution 2018 taking place in
G ottingen from September 27th to 28th 2018 (http://-
goevol.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=meeting20160).
The perception of environmental stimuli, their process-
ing and integration is essential for any organism. Apart
from the more familiar senses like hearing, seeing or
tasting, there are sensory tasks performed by highly
specialized animals, such as echolocation in bats or the
perception of polarized light in insects. Sensory process-
ing consequently also diers strongly between species.
However, at the same time there are astonishing simi-
larities between sensory modalities of phylogenetically
distant animal groups, such as the shared cellular struc-
ture of light-sensitive organs or the genetic control anddevelopmental origin of sensory cells. With methodolog-
ical innovation, more and more species can be used for
detailed analyses, which further expand the understand-
ing of the evolution of sensation.
Because of the diversity of research and various method-
ologies in multiple (emerging) model organisms in the
eld of evolution of sensation we want to bring together
scientists from a broad range of elds to reveal common-
alities across disciplines.
Following the GOEvol tradition, we aim for an interdis-
ciplinary symposium with an informal atmosphere with
plenty of possibilities for social networking. If you enjoy
small interactive meetings and the topic suits you, come
along!
There are several slots for contributing talks and poster
presentations. We strongly encourage interested stu-
dents and researchers from all levels (Bachelor, Master,
PhD and above) to register and apply for talks and
poster presentations.
Moreover, we want to support parents to participate.
Therefore, depending on the demand, we will be able
to provide childcare as well as designated rooms for
nursing.
Please book hotel rooms as early as possible since there
is a conicting fare in Hannover. Hotel rooms are ex-
tremely rare.
Registration is possible from March 15th to July 15th
2018 following this link:

UK SexualSelection May
Dear all
Can I draw your attention to this meeting, one of the
Royal Society Theo Murphy meetings. Held at Chiche-
ley Hall in Buckinghamshire, UK. We have a stellar line
up of speakers, both specialists in sexual selection in
extant organisms as well as palaeontologists.
Sexual selection is potentially an important driver of
macroevolutionary processes like speciation and extinc-
tion, but this has rarely been tested using the fossil
record. This meeting will bring biologists and palaeon-
tologists together to discuss sexual selection's role in
macroevolution, how to detect it in extinct animals and
how to measure its inuence on the history of life across
geological time
https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/-
2018/05/sexual-selection/ All welcome and plenty of
places available. The conference itself is free, you can
stay at the centre (for a fee) or organise your own
accommodation nearby.

BarcelonaCRAG
PlantPaleogenomics
Graduate position on plant palaeogenomics available in
Barcelona.
The Botigue lab for \Genomics of ancient crops and
domestication" in the Centre for Research in Agricul-
tural Genomics (CRAG) in Barcelona is oering a PhD
position under the International CRAG Severo Ochoa
Porgram to work on the genomic analysis of ancient
emmer wheat from Egypt with the goal to better under-
stand plant domestication.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Plant domestication is a
topic of interest in a broad range of research elds such
as agronomics, genome evolution, archaeology or an-
thropology. Past limitations in the study of the early
domestication process can now be overcome by includ-
ing ancient samples in crop genomic analysis. Our labhas access to emmer wheat samples excavated in Egypt
dated from the Neolithic up to the Roman period. This
project aims to extract the DNA from these ancient sam-
ples and sequence it to perform downstream genomic
analyses that will allow us to answer several questions
regarding wheat domestication. Specically, the PhD
candidate will use cutting-edge bioinformatic and sta-
tistical tools under a population genetics framework
to work on i) investigating the genomic architecture
of Egyptian wheat population through time, includ-
ing modern wheat; ii) characterizing known phenotypic
traits in the ancient samples such as the non-shattering
phenotype, and iii) identifying regions of the genome
selected during domestication through the comparison
of the observed evolution of allele frequencies and com-
putational simulations.
This project is a collaborative eort with University
College London and Warwick University and presents
an opportunity to learn and develop a wide range of
techniques to perform genomic analysis and computa-
tional modeling. As a result, new aspects of cereal
domestication will be discovered, and a step forward
in the identication of genomic regions of interest forApril 1, 2018 EvolDir 19
domestication will have been made. Furthermore, the
PhD student will analyse for the rst time genetic data
from ancient specimens from dierent time periods.
REQUIREMENTS: The CRAG Severo Ochoa program
is aimed at international students who have completed
one of the following options by September 2018:
- studies that lead to an ocial Spanish (or from another
country of the European Higher Education Area) uni-
versity degree in Biology, Biochemistry, Biotechnology,
or related areas and that have 300 credits (ECTS), of
which at least 60 must correspond to master level. - a
degree in a non-Spanish university not adapted to the
European Higher Education Area that gives access to
doctoral studies in Biology, Biochemistry, Biotechnology
or related areas.
Candidates are selected exclusively on merit, on the
basis of their curriculum. Academic grades and the cur-
riculum of applicants are evaluated, as well as reference
letters and a motivation letter. No selection criteria
for positive or negative discrimination are applied. Ap-
plicants should have obtained a degree after January
2015. Candidates cannot be in possession of a PhD De-
gree. Candidates cannot have been hired as predoctoral
students for more than 12 months before the start of
the CRAG \Severo Ochoa PhD Program. Candidates
cannot have started a pre-doctoral fellowship funded
by the Spanish "Plan Estatal de Investigacion, Desar-
rollo e Innovacion Tecnologica\ or any previous "Plan
Nacional\.

PROJECT TITLE:
Interactions of wild, translocated and hatchery-reared
juvenile salmonids: implications for management
PROJECT SUMMARY:
We welcome applications for a funded PhD studentship
in Professor Rob Britton's group at Bournemouth Uni-
versity, UK. The project will involve stream-scale manip-
ulation experiments to test whether wild fry transloca-
tions can be used instead of hatchery sh stocking to in-
crease juvenile recruitment in wild Atlantic salmon pop-
ulations. The goal of the project is to understand how
the demographic benets of stocking can be achieved
without the evolutionary risks associated with hatch-
ery rearing, articial selection and maladaption to the
wild. The research will be conducted in collaboration
with Inland Fisheries Ireland, with extensive eldwork
throughout the River Erri National Salmonid Index
Catchment near Galway, Ireland.

PhD position : Host^ aparasite interactions in hybridizing
Daphnia, from correlations to experiments
Deadline extension!
The PhD student will participate in a collaborative re-
search project with PD Dr Piet Spaak (Eawag) and
Prof. Justyna Wolinska (Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater
Ecology and Inland Fisheries, IGB in Berlin, Germany),
nanced by the Swiss and German Science Foundations
(SNF & DFG).
Eutrophication is a worldwide environmental problem
accelerated by global warming, aecting the stability of
aquatic ecosystems and having long^ aconsequences. We
will investigate if and how eutrophication aects two
interacting evolutionary processes: disease spread and in-
terspecic hybridization. We will use water eas (Daph-
nia), a well-established model in both host-parasite and
hybridization research. This project is a combination of
a eld survey, a mesocosm experiment (where trophic
conditions will be manipulated), the transcriptional pro-
ling of Daphnia exposed to stressful eutrophic condi-
tions, and the development and application of molecular
markers to study parasite evolution in eutrophic envi-
ronments. Overall, through the unique combination of
expertise and methods, this project will improve our un-
derstanding of disease spread and biodiversity loss under
dierent trophic conditions and, consequently, might
provide tools for management of aquatic ecosystems.
Within the project this position focuses on interspecic
hybridization. The main task will be participation in a
large-scale eld study and mesocosm experiment; data
collection and processing. The student will screen the
dynamics of natural and experimental Daphnia commu-
nities, using microsatellite and SNP markers. Also, the
student will conduct a large laboratory experiment to as-
sess Daphnia stress responses; here, RNA-Seq methods
will be applied. The PhD student will take advantage
of the draft D. galeata genome.
Although the student will be hosted primarily at Eawag,
exchange stays are planned at IGB. Moreover, generous
funds are available to cover attendance at national and
international conferences. He/she will be enrolled at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z urich.April 1, 2018 EvolDir 23
The position will be for a period of four years, and
should start as soon as possible (spring / early summer
2018).
The ideal candidate should have good molecular skills
and a strong background in evolutionary biology, ecol-
ogy or related elds. In addition, knowledge of statistics,
bioinformatics and/or population genetics will be highly
advantageous. Excellent communication and writing
skills in English, good work ethic, and creative thinking
are desired. A Master's Degree (or equivalent) in biol-
ogy or a related subject is necessary for admission. The
working language in the group is English.
Eawag oers a unique research and working envi-

GhentU AvianSpeciation
PHD POSITION TO STUDY LATERAL PROCESSES
IN AVIAN SPECIATION
The Terrestrial Ecology Unit (TEREC) at Ghent Univer-
sity is a vivid lab, where students and researchers apply
rst principles of individual-based ecology to predict
how natural populations are aected by long- and short-
term environmental change. We believe that innovation
in research can only be propelled by amalgamating skillsand perspectives from dierent disciplines into an over-
arching framework. For our new project Zosteromics,
launched by Prof. Luc Lens and Dr. Jan O. Engler,
we want to capitalize on the newest developments in
genomics and computational biology paired with classi-
cal ecological work to understand how avian speciation
works in complex and changing environments.
The \great speciator" bird genus Zosterops, also known
as white-eyes, shows a remarkable speciation rate which
is unprecedented in birds and one of the highest among
vertebrates. This diversication is partly driven by
adaptation to rapidly changing environments - yet, the
exact processes remain unknown. Therefore, these iconic
birds pose an ideal study system to learn more about
speciation in a changing world.
Within the Zosteromics project, we have one fully funded
PhD position available to work at TEREC alongside
a multilateral consortium of experts (see below). The
position is available for 2+2 years and a salary range of
1900 - 1950euro / Month (+ benets). The preferred,
yet negotiable, starting date is 1st of October 2018. The
PhD can be conducted in one of two topics.
Topic 1: Genomics of white-eye diversication
Recent insights into rapid species diversication using
genomic tools question the notion of vertical processes
as leading evolutionary force in favor of network-like
structures in which vertical and lateral evolutionary
drivers act in concert, e.g. when hybridization leads
to adaptive introgression. Using de novo assemblies
and whole-genome resequencing of dierent highland-
lowland white-eye lineages across East African sky-
islands you will study the role of lateral processes and
understand the evolutionary role of genes introgressed
that way. This topic will be jointly performed with Asst.
Prof. Alexander Suh, Dept. of Ecology and Genetics,
Uppsala University, Germany.
Topic 2: Simulating speciation in dynamic environments
Dierent speciation models aim to formally describe evo-
lution along elevational gradients. To assess how these
speciation models describe white-eye diversication, you
will implement a Mechanistic Simulation Model that
is spatially-explicit, individual-based, and stochastic,
incorporating all processes relevant for biodiversity dy-
namics. You will run the model under neural and adap-
tive (informed by genomic outcomes) conditions to un-
derstand the role of lateral processes of speciation in
changing environments. This topic will be jointly per-
formed with Prof. Juliano Cabral, CCTB, University of
Wurzburg, Germany.
Candidates should have an excellent MSc degree in a
relevant eld, are self-driven, and eager to work in anApril 1, 2018 EvolDir 25
interdisciplinary and multilateral team. Next to quanti-
tative skills relevant for the respective topic, we expect
generally high writing and verbal communication skills
to present results of your work in academic journals and
at international conferences.
To apply send your complete application, including mo-
tivation letter, full CV, publication list, and contact
details of two references alongside your preferred topic
to Zosteromics@ugent.be.
Deadline is 3rd of April 2018.

The Genomic Microbiology Group of Prof. Tal Da-
gan in the Institute of Microbiology at Kiel University,
Germany, invites applications for a:
PhD position in computational evolutionary genomics
The position is oered within the International Max
Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Evolutionary Bi-
ology
Application deadline is March 25, 2018.
Research topic: Phylogenetic tree rooting and infer-
ence of lateral gene transfer Phylogenetic trees are used
to describe and investigate the evolutionary relations
between entities. In most tree reconstruction meth-
ods the inferred phylogeny is unrooted, and the an-
cestral relations between the taxonomic units are not
resolved. The determination of ancestor-descendant
relations in an unrooted tree is achieved by the infer-ence of a root node, which a priori can be located on
any of the branches of the unrooted tree. Recently
we introduced the Minimal Ancestor Deviation (MAD)
rooting method, which operates on any phylogenetic tree
with branch lengths (Tria et al. (2017) Nat Ecol Evol
1:0193). The new method explicitly quanties the major
confounding factor - rate variation among lineages - to
achieve unprecedented accuracy and consistency. The
PhD candidate will take part in further developing this
rooting method and researching the applicability of the
method for reconstructing donor-recipient relations in
gene transfer events during prokaryote evolution. T he
project requires background in molecular evolution and
programming skills.
Research Group: The PhD candidate will work in the
Genomic Microbiology group led by Prof. Tal Dagan
(http://www.uni-kiel.de/genomik) that is focused on
microbial genome evolution. The group is international
and multidisciplinary with both computational and ex-

MasseyU 2 PlantEvolution
Two fully-funded PhD Scholarships
Investigating native plants derived from whole-genome
duplication events and understanding why they are suc-
cessful
Project description: We are seeking two highly-
motivated PhD students for a project that seeks to
understand why plants with multiple sets of chromo-
somes (polyploidy) are so common in New Zealand and
elsewhere. The three-year project is part of a new Royal
Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund grant. Speci-
cally, we want to determine the relative roles of genetic
dierentiation, genomic downsizing, trait innovation
and novel ecological opportunities in the evolutionary
success of many polypoid species. Our prediction is
that polyploidy creates both costs and opportunities for
plants which limit the type of environments they can
occupy. The idea is to investigate plant lineages in New
Zealand with well-documented and dierent levels of
chromosome duplication. With the research team, the
aim is obtain information on genome size, gene expres-
sion, phylogenetic relationships, ecophysiological and
trait features, and undertake process-based niche mod-
elling across ploidy levels in six representative lineages
(e.g. Asplenium, Poa, Plantago, Schizeilema, Leptinella,
Veronica).This is an ideal PhD opportunity in evolutionary ecol-
ogy and the students will gain experience in genomic
analysis, comparative phylogenetics, trait analysis, and
species distribution modelling, depending on their inter-
ests.
Project Supervisors: Professor Bill Lee, School of Bio-
logical Sciences, University of Auckland and Landcare
Research, Dunedin, New Zealand; Dr Jen Tate, Massey
University, Palmerston North; Dr Heidi Meudt and Dr
Patrick Brownsey, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa
Tongarewa , Wellington. The PhD students will also
gain experience working with Professor Dirk Albach
(Carl von Ossietzky-University Oldenburg, Germany)
and Dr Andrew Tanentzap (University of Cambridge,
UK).
Funding: Funding includes a tax-free stipend, full tu-
ition fees, and operational expenses for travel, conference
attendance and research expenses over the 3-year pro-
gramme. Both international and domestic students are
eligible. One PhD (ecophysiology, species distribution
modelling) will be run from the University of Auckland
but will include time at Landcare Research in Dunedin,
while the other (phylogenetics, genomics) will be based
at Massey University, Palmerston North.
Requirements: Applicants should have completed a de-
gree with a signicant research component (e.g. MSc or
BSc Honours), and have an excellent academic record.
Applicants need to have a background either in plant
ecology, ecophysiology, phylogenetics or computational
biology.
Applicants should email their CV, academic transcripts,
a cover letter stating why you are interested in the posi-
tion and how your qualications and experience make
you a good t for the proposed research, and the con-
tact details for at least two referees to Prof. Bill Lee

Two fully-funded PhD Scholarships
Investigating native plants derived from whole-genome
duplication events and understanding why they are suc-
cessful
Project description: We are seeking two highly-
motivated PhD students for a project that seeks to
understand why plants with multiple sets of chromo-
somes (polyploidy) are so common in New Zealand and
elsewhere. The three-year project is part of a new Royal
Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund grant. Speci-
cally, we want to determine the relative roles of genetic
dierentiation, genomic downsizing, trait innovation
and novel ecological opportunities in the evolutionary
success of many polypoid species. Our prediction is
that polyploidy creates both costs and opportunities for
plants which limit the type of environments they can
occupy. The idea is to investigate plant lineages in New
Zealand with well-documented and dierent levels of
chromosome duplication. With the research team, the
aim is obtain information on genome size, gene expres-
sion, phylogenetic relationships, ecophysiological and
trait features, and undertake process-based niche mod-
elling across ploidy levels in six representative lineages
(e.g. Asplenium, Poa, Plantago, Schizeilema, Leptinella,
Veronica).
This is an ideal PhD opportunity in evolutionary ecol-
ogy and the students will gain experience in genomic
analysis, comparative phylogenetics, trait analysis, and
species distribution modelling, depending on their inter-
ests.
Project Supervisors: Professor Bill Lee, School of Bio-
logical Sciences, University of Auckland and Landcare
Research, Dunedin, New Zealand; Dr Jen Tate, Massey
University, Palmerston North; Dr Heidi Meudt and Dr
Patrick Brownsey, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa
Tongarewa , Wellington. The PhD students will also
gain experience working with Professor Dirk Albach
(Carl von Ossietzky-University Oldenburg, Germany)
and Dr Andrew Tanentzap (University of Cambridge,
UK).
Funding: Funding includes a tax-free stipend, full tu-
ition fees, and operational expenses for travel, conference
attendance and research expenses over the 3-year pro-
gramme. Both international and domestic students are30 EvolDir April 1, 2018
eligible. One PhD (ecophysiology, species distribution
modelling) will be run from the University of Auckland
but will include time at Landcare Research in Dunedin,
while the other (phylogenetics, genomics) will be based
at Massey University, Palmerston North.
Requirements: Applicants should have completed a de-
gree with a signicant research component (e.g. MSc or
BSc Honours), and have an excellent academic record.
Applicants need to have a background either in plant
ecology, ecophysiology, phylogenetics or computational
biology.
Applicants should email their CV, academic transcripts,
a cover letter stating why you are interested in the posi-

PhD scholarship within comparative analysis of genome
regulation
The successful candidate will be associated with the
projects \TRANSPOSE" (2018-2021) and \REWIRED"
(2018-2021), recently funded by the Norwegian Re-
search Council FRIPRO program. Both these projects
are addressing fundamental knowledge gaps concerning
genome evolution following whole genome duplication,
using salmonid shes as a model system. Specically, our
aim is to test if functional redundancy in a duplicated
genome spark evolution of novel adaptive functions, and
the importance of transposable elements in the evolution
of these novel adaptations.
A key element in the projects is collaboration with Rori
Rohlfs at San Francisco State University and use her
computational framework (EVE) to identify genes under
divergent selection pressure on gene regulation. Thecandidate will therefore be expected to spend signicant
time in the Rohlfs-lab during the project.
The main tasks will be to: - Annotate and build a cata-
logue of transposable elements in salmonid sh genomes
- Integrate information on transposable elements (ge-
nomic positions and historical activity) with analyses of
transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) and epigenomics (ChIP-Seq,
ATAC-Seq) data in a comparative framework across
10 sh species. - Within the comparative framework,
investigate the impact of transposable element activity
on evolution of adaptive gene expression changes.

PhD Student Position on Palaeogenomics of Prehistoric
Climate Change
Swedish Museum of Natural History & Stockholm Uni-
versity
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This PhD project will investigate how species are af-
fected by climate change. To do this, we will use a
palaeogenomic approach to analyse ancient DNA from
prehistoric bones and teeth sampled across several well-
known severe and rapid changes in climate that took
place during the last ice age. The analyses will comprise
several animal species in Eurasia. The specic aims of
the project are to i) assess the degree to which past
warm periods led to demographic bottlenecks, ii) exam-
ine to what extent climate-induced range contractions
led to losses of unique genetic variation, and iii) use a
comparative genomic approach to investigate whether
species adapted genetically in response to rapid climate
uctuations.
For this project, good knowledge in population genet-
ics, bioinformatics as well as experience of laborative
DNA analysis are important qualications. The PhD
student will join the ancient DNA research group at the
Swedish Museum of Natural History (for further details,
seewww.palaeogenetics.com/adna).
ENVIRONMENT The PhD student will be employed by
Stockholm University (SU), but will be based at the De-
partment of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (SMNH). The museum is
located in Stockholm, which by many is regarded as one
of the most beautiful capitals in the world and is home
to a vibrant scientic community with several leading
research institutes as well as the National Genomics
Infrastructure at the Science for Life Laboratory. The
SMNH has a strong mission in natural history research,
and its research division has more than 170 employees.
The main supervisor for the PhD project will be Prof.
Love Dalen at the SMNH. The project is funded by the
Bolin Centre for Climate Research and the Department
of Zoology at SU, and will be co-supervised by Prof.April 1, 2018 EvolDir 33
Anders Gotherstrom at SU.

PhD position on Evolution of cognition in the guppy
PhD position available in Niclas Kolm's research group
at Stockholm University. The group uses mainly the
guppy (Poecilia reticulata) as a model to experimentally
investigate the link between evolutionary changes in
brain anatomy and behaviour. The aim of this PhD
project is to investigate how individual cognitive ability
and learning strategies are aected by rapid evolution
of brain size and schooling behaviour. The existing arti-
cial selection lines of large- and small-brained guppies
and the recently developed selection lines of guppies
with dierences in schooling behaviour will form the
base of the project. The main focus of the project is thusto use existing and develop new ecologically relevant
cognitive tests and behavioural assays to evaluate how
rapid evolutionary changes in brain size and behaviour
aect learning abilities and other behavioural aspects
in both individual and collective contexts.
The work will be lab-oriented utilizing the Kolm lab
guppy facilities with over 4000 aquaria and multiple
set-ups for cognitive tests and behavioural assays of
available selection lines in both 2D and 3D using ad-
vanced hard- and software to track individual behaviour.
You will be part of a dynamic international team of PhD
students and postdocs. The project will require hard
work but at the same time provide excellent opportu-
nities for personal initiatives and development towards
a successful academic career. An important task will
be to collect and analyse complex data in a way that
controls for the setups of replicated articial selection
designs. Worth noting is that Stockholm University
oers extremely good conditions for this type of 4 year
fully funded PhD position.

StockholmU LifeHistoryEvolution
PhD position on Life history evolution across climate
clines in butteries We are inviting applications for a
PhD position in the research group of Karl Gotthard
that is focusing on the evolution of life history and plas-
ticity in seasonal environments, using primarily natural
populations of butteries as model organisms.
The new PhD will work within the project ' Life his-
tory evolution across climate clines' and will focus on
the evolution of life cycle timing in situations where
insect species show shifts in the number of annual gen-
erations, i.e. when there are shifts in voltinism. The
phenomenon of voltinism shifts is relatively common
in insects and means that a given species shifts from
having two full generations per year in southern or low
altitude locations, to have only one annual generation
in northern or high altitude locations. Selection is likely
to change signicantly across voltinism shifts as they
signify a dramatic change in optimal life history strat-
egy. In particular the new project aims at exploring life
cycle adaptations and potential voltinism shifts in the
expanding range margins of buttery species that are
presently expanding their distributions northwards. At
the northern range limits these expanding species are ex-
pected to experience strong selection for changes in how
photoperiod regulates life cycle timing and voltinism.
The project aims at testing the general prediction from
life history theory that there are footprints of selection
for a change in life cycle regulation resulting in a shift
from the ancestral state of having two generations per
year to having only one annual generation. In this way
the project will provide novel insights into ecological
consequences of the interaction between the two most
prominent eects of climate change on natural popu-
lations: northward range expansions and selection for
changes in seasonal life cycle regulation.
The project will contain aspects of both eld and lab-
oratory work to study the ecology, genetics and physi-
ology of life cycle timing in temperate butteries. The
prospective student will sample replicated populations
and do controlled laboratory studies of how phenotypic
adaptations and associated genetic variation is changing
across shifts in voltinism. The genetics will be studied
by quantitative genetic methods and genomics, while
the physiological manifestations of the dierent tim-
ing adaptations will be investigated using respirometryand cold tolerance assays. Finally, we plan to do use
reciprocal transplant experiments in outdoor cages to
test the adaptive signicance of local dierence in these
adaptations.
The PhD will be part of the Division of Ecology and
it is funded by grants from the Bolin Centre for Cli-
mate Research at Stockholm University and the Swedish
Research Council (VR).
Stockholm University oers very good conditions for
PhD positions, that are 4 year fully funded positions.
We are looking for candidates with a strong interest in
evolutionary ecology, plasticity and life history theory,
with excellent analytical ability and experience with
quantitative analyses of life history traits and of other
traits of interest. Experience in working with insects in
the lab and in the eld, as well as having a valid drivers
license, is especially meriting.

WinterEvolutionaryEcology
PhD project on Winter evolutionary ecology in butter-
ies
The Department of Zoology invites applications for a
four-year PhD position as part of the project 'The ef-
fects of microclimate variability on insect overwintering
biology' funded through grants from the Bolin Centre
for Climate Research and the Research Council Formas.
Diapause is a resting stage characterized by develop-
mental arrest and suppressed metabolism that occurs
commonly in insects. Its mechanistic underpinnings are
poorly understood, as are physiological commonalities
among insects in how diapause is regulated. This is
surprising since diapause is common and an important
part of the life-cycle in most insects in seasonal envi-
ronments. Models of insect phenology are critical toApril 1, 2018 EvolDir 35
correctly manage pest insects, but these often suer
from unclear diapause physiology components and in-
accurate microhabitat climate models, which leads to
overall poor model resolution. Ongoing climate change
is aecting winter climate more strongly than summer
climate, which exacerbates the lack of information on
diapause development and winter microclimatology.
The overarching aim of the PhD project is to understand
how spatial and temporal variation in microclimate af-
fects the life-cycle regulation of butteries in Sweden.
The student will investigate seasonal microclimatic vari-
ability in overwintering habitats with the aim to link
large scale climate models to micro-scales - scales that
actually matter for overwintering insects. The student
will also combine integrated physiological models on dia-
pause termination with microclimate models to measure
the energetic cost of diapause with the aim to estimate
the eect of winter warming on insect population ecology
and range dynamics.
The project will combine several approaches: (i) Fields
surveys describing the spatial and temporal microcli-
matic patterns in overwintering landscapes that are
combined with sophisticated statistical microclimate
models. (ii) In-situ eld experiments where summer

ExperimentalEvolutionMicrobes
Funded PhD studentship in microbial evolution at the
University of Aberdeen (Scotland, UK): \Experimental
evolution of Thaumarchaeota"
The fundamental aim of this project is to determine
the process of adaptive diversication and associated
trade-os in tness, by studying microbial evolution
experimentally.
A 4-year PhD studentship in microbial evolution, start-
ing in May 2018 at the earliest, is now open for applica-
tion at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The
deadline for applications is April 12th 2018 and this
studentship is available to students of any nationality
(providing funding for tuition fees and stipend). The
PhD project is funded by the Royal Society and will
target key evolutionary questions with a special focus
on Thaumarchaeota to align with the research thematic
of the University of Aberdeen Nitrication Group.
Using microbes to test theory in evolutionary biology
has led to major scientic advances. In particular, micro-
bial experimental evolution has allowed analysis of both
microbial adaptation (genomic and phenotypic changes)
and diversication (phenotypic evolution and lineage-
splitting) using controlled environments, through in-
creased understanding of the nature and frequency of
genomic substitutions, their eects on microbial tness
and the mechanisms by which diversity is created and
maintained in microbial populations. These concepts
were established from studies of bacteria, fungi, viruses
and phage, focussing mainly on a few bacterial model
organisms (1, 2). However, an entire domain of life,
the Archaea (3), has largely been ignored by evolution-
ary biologists, despite their widespread distribution in
natural environments, high abundance and essential con-
tribution to global ecosystem functioning that sustains
the planet. A priori, no clear reasons for dierent evo-
lutionary processes between archaea and bacteria can
be advanced, but their ancient evolutionary divergence
(despite the existence of lateral gene transfer between
domains) suggests that the relevance of established mi-
crobial models of adaptation and diversication should
be tested on these organisms if they are to be considered
universal. Indeed, despite the global importance and
diversity of archaea, our understanding of the ecological
and evolutionary processes generating their high diver-36 EvolDir April 1, 2018
sity is scarce compared to that of eukaryotes and, to a
lesser extent, bacteria.
This project will focus on members of a key microbial
phylum, the Thaumarchaeota (4, 5), which are abundant
and ubiquitous and perform a critical ecosystem func-
tion, ammonia oxidation. The distribution of natural
microbial communities is inuenced by environmental
characteristics, and pH is the major abiotic factor in-
uencing extant thaumarchaeotal niche specialisation
(4), and has also inuenced their diversication and
patterns of lineage formation through deep evolutionary
time (5).
This project will involve re-isolation of a thaumarchaeo-
tal strain (6) followed by the study the evolution of these
microbes experimentally. Experimental evolution will
be performed in automated mini-bioreactors by impos-
ing environmental changes under controlled conditions
and the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation and
diversication as well as the existence of trade-os will
be determined using genomic and tness changes over
time.
The PhD student will join a dynamic team of re-
searchers led by Dr C ecile Gubry-Rangin (https://-
www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/people/proles/c.rangin) and will
benet from the presence of strong groups in the de-
partment working on related topics as well as being
embedded in a strong network of international collabo-
rations. The University of Aberdeen provides an excel-
lent scientic environment, state-of-the-art technological
support facilities and diverse training opportunities for
all aspects of research and for transferable academic and
generic skills.
Candidate should have (or expected to achieve) a mini-
mum of 2:1 Honours degree, ideally (but not required)
an MSc in evolution, ecology or related, strong theoret-
ical skills and enthusiasm for learning and developing
microbial experimental evolution.

UAucklandNZ EvolBirdSong
One PhD position available for new project on the
evolutionary origins of song learning in birds. This
project is a collaboration between Dr. Kristal Cain
(kecain.weebly.com) at the University of Auckland
in New Zealand, and Dr Michelle Hall (michelle-
hall.wordpress.com) at The University of Melbourne
in Australia. Both domestic and international applica-
tions are encouraged.
Vocal learning in birds is of great interdisciplinary im-
portance and an excellent model for human language.
This research relies on a clear understanding of the evo-
lutionary origins of vocal learning, but recent reports
have undermined previous assumptions, leading to a
hotly contested debate about the evolution of vocal
learning. Vocal development in one group of birds, the
New Zealand wrens (Acanthisitti), is critical for resolv-
ing this debate, but is currently unknown and unstudied.
The project will focus on ti Itipounamu/rieman and
combine in-depth behavioural analyses with new acous-
tic tools to determine whether vocalisations are learned
or innate in these endemic birds. We are also interested
in sex dierences in vocal acquisition patterns.
This project has a strong eld focus and will require
substantial time in remote areas. There is exibility
for keen students to guide the direction of the research
within the framework of the overall project. The PhD
project is anticipated to start mid-2018, with eldwork
commencing in August. Informal inquiries are welcome.
Preferred selection criteria
- Strong previous academic record
- Enthusiasm and interest in the broad concepts and
questions motivating the research
- Interest in undertaking eld-based avian research, es-
pecially in collecting acoustic data
- Enjoyment of outdoor eldwork and condence in work-
ing in remote locations that can experience extreme
weather.April 1, 2018 EvolDir 37
- Excellent interpersonal, oral and written communica-
tion skills
- Ability to learn/use R (statistical programming lan-
guage), new packages for analysis (e.g. warbleR), and
new software (e.g. Sound Analysis Pro)
- Experience with bird banding/ringing, nest searching,
and acoustic techniques is helpful
To apply, please send an e-mail briey explaining your
research interests and career goals, a CV, a copy of
academic transcripts, and contact information for two

by the Marsden Fund of The Royal Society of New
Zealand (broadly equivalent of US NSF). Funding in-
cludes a tax-free stipend, full tuition fees, and opera-
tional expenses for travel, conference attendance and
research expenses over the 3-year programme.
Requirements: Applicants should have completed a
degree with a signicant research component (e.g.
MSc or BSc Honours), and have an excellent aca-
demic record. Students will need to qualify for a
U Auckland scholarship and admission to U Auck-

project aims to understand the genomic, genetic and
physiological basis of nuclear cytoplasmic incompat-
ibilities, specically concerning mitochondria. Well-
functioning mitochondria are essential for the survival42 EvolDir April 1, 2018
and reproduction of all eukaryotes, including humans.
To make a functioning mitochondrion, both nuclear and
mitochondrial genes have to interact harmoniously. In
general, mitochondrial genomes evolve faster, posing a
potential problem due to nuclear cytoplasmic incom-
patibilities. In humans, mitochondrial mutations cause
the most common human genetic diseases. Additionally,
nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities contribute to early
postzygotic isolation between incipient species.
This project uses known hybrid incompatibilities in a
four-species parasitoid wasp system to reveal and under-
stand the genetic architecture of the observed nuclear-
cytoplasmic incompatibilities in F2 male hybrids. This
incompatibility comes in degrees ranging from none to
90% lethality in the most distant crosses. It is also
known that rearing temperature inuences the eect of
this hybrid incompatibility (e.g., no ospring survive
at 15 ^AoC and 31 ^AoC, but >30% survive at 25 ^AoC for
one cross). Hence, we will investigate the interaction
of temperature, nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities
and mitochondrial evolution. This should help us to
generally identify and understand the gene regulatory
networks that allow the nuclear and mitochondrial en-
coded genes to interact appropriately.

HyperparasitoidEvolution
PhD position - The enemy of your enemy`s enemy: multi-
trophic interactions in hyperparasitoid ecology
Application deadline: 16 April 2018
Hyperparasitoids are fascinating insects that lay their
eggs in larvae or pupae of primary parasitoids. In ourcuriosity driven research programme, we identied that
some hyperparasitoids nd their parasitoid host by using
plant odours derived from a complex multi-trophic in-
teraction chain. The hyperparasitoids use plant odours
induced by feeding of parasitized herbivores to locate
the parasitoid larvae that are concealed in the herbivore
body. The main aim of this PhD project is to mecha-
nistically understand the interaction chain involved in
hyperparasitoid host location and the role of indirect
interaction chains in community organisation across four
trophic levels. In the project you will aim to i) unravel
plant responses to parasitized aphids and caterpillars
that allow associated hyperparasitoids to locate their
host; ii) identify the physiological changes in aphids
and caterpillars after parasitism; and iii) establish a
causal relationship of which mechanisms in the multi-
trophic interaction chain aect hyperparasitoid host
location and community composition in the eld. You
will use molecular techniques such as RNA-seq and
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeted gene mutagenesis, in-
sect behavioural observations, as well as eld studies.
Within the project you will be closely collaborating with
a technician and post-doc as well as researchers at inter-
national institutes with expertise in molecular biology,
ecology, entomology and plant sciences.
Our ideal candidate has a strong background in molec-
ular ecology, behavioural ecology and/or entomology.
Some experience with molecular techniques such as
RNA-seq, CRISPR-Cas9 and/or bioinformatics will be
considered as advantage. You should be curious for
fundamental sciences and enjoy to combine molecular
biology with eld ecology. We are looking for a highly
motivated candidate who likes to work in a multidisci-
plinary team in a collaborative spirit. Prociency in the
English language is a prerequisite.
We oer a full-time position (38 hours), initially for 1
year after which a go/no go decision will be taken on
extension with another three years. Gross salary per
month ^A 2222,- in the rst year rising to ^A 2840,- per
month in the fourth year, for a fulltime appointment.
The candidate will be based at the Laboratory of En-
tomology Wageningen University, the Netherlands, in
the research team of Dr. Erik H. Poelman. Our team
studies community ecology of plant-insect interactions
and consists of ecologists, entomologists, molecular biol-
ogists and computational modellers. At the Laboratory
of Entomology we aim at an interdisciplinary approach
from cellular to community level to unravel biological
phenomena underlying the functioning of plant-insect
communities, insect vectored diseases, insect neurobi-
ology and insects as food and feed. The Laboratory
of Entomology is part of the Plant Sciences Group of

SeagrassAdaptation
Graduate positions: The University of Western Aus-
tralia, Perth: Seagrass ecophysiology and gene expres-
sion
Two PhD positions are available to study 'Sea-
grass adaptation and acclimation responses to ex-
treme climatic events' in the Kendrick Lab (https:/-
/seagrassresearch.net). Research in the Kendrick lab
focuses on ecology, genetics, and restoration of benthic
habitat-forming species, particularly seagrasses.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Seagrasses evolved around 100 million years ago and
have persisted in the oceans through many signicant
climatic events, including sea level oscillations and tem-
perature changes. The low levels of morphologic and
phylogenetic dierentiation within genera suggest they
are incredibly resilient, and that phenotypic plasticity
may play a signicant role in acclimation and/or adap-
tation to changing environments. The recent increase in
frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events can
cause rapid ecosystem change, likely to be greater than
that caused by a gradually changing climate. These
extreme events can act as strong and acute agents of se-
lection, generating widespread mortality and collapse of
ecosystems. Understanding how seagrasses respond to
change will be a critical component of their management
in the future.
Research for these projects will take place in the World
Heritage Area of Shark Bay, where some of the largest
temperate seagrass meadows in the world occur. These
projects will take interdisciplinary approaches that in-
corporate whole plant growth, ecophysiology and gene
expression responses to explore interactions of multi-ple stressors to extreme events under predicted climate
change scenarios. The PhD applicants will play a major
role in growth, physiology and gene expression studies
in Posidonia australis.
Project supervisors: Professor Gary Kendrick and Dr
Elizabeth Sinclair, School of Biological Sciences and
Oceans Institute, The University of Western Australia,
Dr Martin Breed, School of Biological Science, Univer-
sity of Adelaide and Dr Siegy Krauss, Department of

Australia. Both positions will be based in Perth at The
University of Western Australia.
QUALIFICATIONS
We are seeking two highly-motivated candidates with a
strong background in evolutionary biology, plant physi-
ology, marine biology, statistics, genomics, and/or bioin-
formatics. Applicants must have a rst class Honours

Deadline for application: 25 March 2018 https:/-
/www.uantwerpen.be/en/jobs/vacancies/ap/-
2018zapfwetex015/ As part of its dynamic research
policy and supported by the possibilities oered by
the Flemish Government through the resources of the
Special Research Fund (BOF), the Faculty of Science is
seeking to ll a full-time vacancy in the Department of
Biology for a
Research professor (TTZAPBOF) in the area of Evolu-
tionary, Ecological and Environmental Omics
The molecular instrumentation of an organism deter-
mines its capacity to handle natural and anthropogenic
challenges, and is continuously under selective pressure.
Knowledge concerning the molecular and cellular events
is therefore vital to understand the evolutionary pro-
cesses and constraints leading to adaptation to natural
and anthropogenic stressors in vertebrate and inverte-
brate species, as well as the factors that make the dier-
ence between success and failure on the organismal and
population level. The latest technological developments
create exciting opportunities to identify these molecu-
lar pathways and adaptations through (epi)genomics,
transcriptomics and proteomics.
These approaches allow to search for patterns of ge-
netic variation, signatures of selection and to unravel
the molecular processes that control adaptation and
physiological tness. These processes can only be un-
derstood when applying an integrated approach that is
embedded in a physiological, evolutionary and environ-
mental context. The research prole complements the
present expertise in the Department of Biology, which
strongly focuses on the evolutionary, ecophysiological
and ecotoxicological processes of adaptation.
We seek to hire an ambitious researcher with a strong
and preferably combined background in the elds of evo-
lutionary biology, environmental physiology and toxicol-
ogy, applying \omic" approaches to study evolutionary,
genetic and demographic processes in natural popula-tions and/or model species in relation to environmental
stress. The candidate is expected to develop strong
collaborative and complementary links with available
expertise and to strengthen the department' ^As research
capacity within these domains. The research should lead
to novel fundamental insights in the study of adaptation
of natural vertebrate and/or invertebrate populations
in response to natural or anthropogenic stressors (e.g.
global change, environmental pollution).
Job description
The assignment consists of lecturing duties, scientic
research and academic service to society. During a pe-
riod, limited to ve years (duration of the temporary

of evolutionary, ecological and environmental omics as
outlines above. - You will acquire and manage exter-
nal funding (national and international). - You will
supervise doctoral students. - You will oer scientic
services: among others you take part in further develop-
ing and managing the omics based analytical platforms.
- You will be assigned limited lecturing duties within the
domain not exceeding 30 contact hours per semester.
Prole and requirements
- You hold a doctorate degree (PhD) in Biology or a
related discipline. - You have a minimum of 2 year ex-
perience on Postdoctoral level at the closing date of the
vacancy. - You have an international academic CV and
perform qualitatively outstanding academic research in
the broader eld according to the domain involved. -
You have experience in grant application and project
management. - The focus in your teaching corresponds

Minion availability
Dear Colleagues,
I am interested in running 1-3 trial samples on an Ox-
ford Nanopore Tech MINION, which has the advantage
that one can directly sequence RNA with the need to
creating cDNA. Their website says that some 6,000 users
exist for this tiny, cheap ( $1,000) sequencer the size of a
USB drive on which one can sequence hyperlong reads
by threading the DNA or RNA strand thru a pore be-
tween two chambers. The dierent size and shape of the
dierent bases lead to dierent changes in the voltages
dierential between chambers, allowing deducing the
base sequence, as many will know. An even smaller
sequencer, the Smidgeon is on the way. I was wondering
if any one has a MINION and would be able to let me
run a few trial samples or can recommend a genomics
center. Areas of proximity for running things in person
are New York and Denmark/ Germany/ France.
The equipment is ideal for many uses (detecting viruses
in foods without the need for a priory expectations as
to what one may nd, same for analyses on viruses
inside/partly inside micro/nanoplastics in tissues).

is a eld-based wildlife research programme that studies
desert baboons in Namibia. Every year, we recruit a
small team of eld volunteers to assist with our scientic
work.
The Tsaobis Baboon Project is a long-term study of
wild desert baboons in Namibia. We are currently re-April 1, 2018 EvolDir 67
cruiting Volunteer Field Assistants for our 2018 eld
season. These positions combine practical research with
training and are entirely eld-based. The volunteers are
trained by and work alongside doctoral students and
postdoctoral researchers, assisting with their studies
and contributing to the wider research activities of the
Baboon Project.
The eldwork will primarily involve daily follows of ba-
boon troops on foot, collecting data on the behaviour of
individually recognisable animals, together with monthly
vegetation surveys, and the capture of both study troops
to t GPS collars and collect measurements and sam-
ples. This year, our research focus is on baboon social
behaviour and female reproductive strategies.
Three Volunteer Field Assistant positions are currently
available, each running for three months from late Au-
gust to late November. Once the volunteers arrive in
Namibia, the Tsaobis Baboon Project covers all their
work-related costs, including all meals and accommo-
dation. We will also cover the costs of the volunteers'
research visas and travel insurance. On the successful
completion of eldwork, we also contribute a minimum
of pounds 75 towards the cost of the volunteers' air
ticket. The Volunteer Field Assistants will learn and
implement a range of research skills related to the study
of animal behaviour and ecology. Following training, the
eldwork will primarily involve daily follows of baboon
troops on foot, during which they will collect data on the
behaviour of individually recognisable animals, together
with monthly vegetation surveys and wider ecological
monitoring related to the baboons' environment. This
year we will also be briey capturing our study troops
to collect routine measurements and samples. Who are
we looking for?
These positions are open to all with an interest in animal
behaviour and ecology. We are particularly keen to hear
from applicants who: * Are friendly, easygoing people,
happy to live in small team under basic conditions at
a remote eld site * Are strongly motivated, reliable
and committed * Have good levels of physical tness
and stamina - you will be following the baboons on foot
from dawn to dusk over mountainous terrain in extreme
heat * Show good initiative, with a willingness to learn
and show attention to detail * Have a full, clean driving
licence.
What do volunteers get out of it? * An amazing oppor-
tunity to share the lives of wild baboons in a beautiful
desert landscape * An opportunity to learn new skills
and gain experience, especially those relevant to research
in behaviour, ecology, and conservation * An opportu-
nity to be involved in a long-term project on African
wildlife, hosted by an international research institutionand conservation charity * Most of our volunteers are
graduate students who use their experience on the Ba-
boon Project as a stepping stone on to Masters and
PhD degree course
If you would like to apply, you will need to upload a CV
and covering letter, using the online application on the
following website : https://volunteeringopportunities-

Field assistants summer 2018: Volunteer positions in
evolutionary biology
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and Tech-
nology (IST) Austria requires volunteers to assist with
eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees (Spain)
this coming summer (late May - early August).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary dynam-
ics underlying species diversication in the genus Antir-
rhinum (snapdragons). A major focus of this research
involves eld work on natural hybrid zones between
two subspecies with dierent ower colours. Most of
the eld work is contributing to a long-term pedigree
project aimed at establishing a direct link from genotype
to phenotype to tness. With 20,000 samples collected
over eight generations (so far), this provides an excit-
ing and powerful system to examine many outstanding
questions in speciation and quantitative genetics in wild
populations. We are seeking volunteers to assist with
the eld work, which involves working in teams map-
ping the location of individual plants (GPS), tagging
and sampling them for leaves and owers, measuring
quantitative traits, phenotyping them for ower pigmen-
tation and processing material for later DNA extraction.
There may also be opportunities to be involved in other
projects we are doing on plant-pollinator interactions,
pollen fertility and community ecology surveys. Most of
the work is outdoors, however we do spend some time
indoors processing samples. The work is highly team
orientated, typically in groups of 2-3 in the eld and
larger groups processing samples back at the research
station. This is a great opportunity for anybody looking
to obtain experience in eld work relating to evolution-
ary biology, plant ecology and plant-animal interactions.
You will also be part of a large multidisciplinary team
including researchers from IST Austria, the University
of Vienna, John Innes Centre (Norwich, UK) and the
University of Toulouse.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia).
We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a pic-
turesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(within Europe) are covered. However, we cannot oer
any further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working andApril 1, 2018 EvolDir 69
enthusiastic biology students with a strong interest in
working outdoors with plants. You must be meticulous
with recording data and also be comfortable working
as part of a team. Experience with eld-based projects
and plants is preferred but not essential.
We require assistance between late May and late July.
Depending on the year and the plants, we may extend
our time into August. Length of stay is exible but a
minimum stay of 3 weeks is required.
Please send any questions to Dr. Melinda Pickup via
the email address below. How to apply? By the clos-

FurSealGenomics
Postdoctoral position or PhD studentship: fur seal ge-
nomics
With Dr Joe Homan (Bielefeld University) and Dr
Jaume Forcada (British Antarctic Survey)
An outstanding opportunity is available either for a post-
doc (' ~A3.5 years) or for a Ph.D. studentship (3 years) to
work on the ecological and evolutionary genomics of fur
seals. The position is available in Joe Homan's research
group (www.thehomanlab.com) in the Department of
Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University. The project
runs from now until the end of 2021 and is funded by the
German Research Foundation (DFG) within the recently
approved collaborative research centre (SFB/TRR 212)
entitled: A Novel Synthesis of Individualisation across
Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution: Niche Choice, Niche
Conformance, Niche Construction (NC3).
The project: The successful candidate will exploit and
continue to build upon an exceptionally detailed long-
term study of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)
at Bird Island, South Georgia. High quality genome
and transcriptome assemblies have already been gen-
erated and microsatellite and high density SNP data
will be available for ' ~A7000 marked individuals span-
ning a time series from the mid 1980's to the current
day. The aim of this project (sub-project A01 of the
collaborative research centre) is to determine how tness
variation is shaped by interactions between individual
genetic quality (inbreeding) and the social environment
within breeding colonies. We will collect highly de-
tailed observational and biometric time-series data from
mother-ospring pairs in two neighbouring colonies of
high and low social density. We will then dissect apart
the mechanistic underpinnings of tness variation using
a combination of endocrinological and immunological
proling, gene expression proling, high-density SNP
genotyping and methylation proling. The result will
be an unprecedentedly detailed understanding of the
behavioural, physiological and genetic mechanisms un-
derpinning tness variation in a wild vertebrate, which
will have important implications for understanding eco-logical and evolutionary dynamics as well as adaptation
to climate change.
Postdoc applicants: We seek a bright and highly moti-
vated postdoc with a strong PhD in a relevant topic (e.g.
population genetics, behavioural genetics, evolutionary
or conservation genomics). We are looking for two main
attributes in particular: (i) The candidate must have a
deep understanding as well as practical experience of
working with genomic data (experience of gene expres-
sion proling and / or whole-genome resequencing would
be particularly desirable) and be procient in writing
custom scripts and working in Unix and R; (ii) As the
project involves two eld seasons at South Georgia in the
South Atlantic, the candidate would ideally also have
experience of eldwork with vertebrates. Experience of
working with long-term individual-based datasets from
wild animal populations would be advantageous but is
not a requirement. The candidate should be able to
work both independently and as part of a multidisci-
plinary team, and a high standard of spoken and written
English is expected.
Ph.D. applicants: Bright and highly motivated Ph.D.
candidates should hold a B.Sc. or equivalent in a rele-
vant topic (e.g. population genetics, behavioural genet-
ics, evolutionary or conservation genomics). An M.Sc.
would also be advantageous but is not necessary. Strong
quantitative skills (including prociency in R) as well
as practical experience of working with next generation
sequence data (e.g. gene expression proling or related
approaches) would be desirable, but training can be pro-
vided. The candidate should also be able to work both
independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team,
and a high standard of spoken and written English is
expected.
The working environment: The successful candidate
will join the Homan lab, a young and dynamic group
comprising three PhD students and two postdocs. They
will be based at the Department of Animal Behaviour
at Bielefeld University (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/-
vhf/index.html). The department is the oldest of its
kind in Germany and currently hosts around six princi-
pal investigators, ten postdocs and twenty PhD students.
It oers a stimulating international environment and an
excellent research infrastructure including brand new
molecular laboratories. The working language of the
Department is English. The successful candidate will
also have the opportunity to interact closely with the
cooperation partner (Dr Jaume Forcada) during two
Antarctic eld seasons and via placements at the British
Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK.

Postdoctoral position in genomics of convergence and
social symbiosis (Parker Lab)
A postdoctoral position is available to study the ge-
nomic basis of evolutionary convergence in the lab of
Joe Parker at the California Institute of Technology.
Work in the Parker lab is focused on the evolution of com-
plex phenotypes, principally in the context of symbiosis.
We use a unique system to explore this phenomenon: the
convergent evolution of symbioses between rove beetles
and social insects. Rove beetles (family Staphylinidae)
are the largest metazoan family, and include multiple
remarkable lineages that have evolved to become \social
parasites" stealth impostors that inltrate ant or termite
societies, employing radical behavioral, anatomical and
chemical adaptations. We have found that many of the
most extreme symbiotic phenotypes have evolved con-
vergently numerous times in distantly related lineages.
We are a now seeking a postdoctoral candidate to probe
the genomic basis of complex phenotypic convergence inthis system. Our goals are twofold: i) Pinpoint shared
or unique molecular changes that drive the evolution
of social symbiosis in rove beetles; ii) Make basic infer-
ences into the long-standing question of how complex
phenotypic changes can arise repeatedly and predictably
over deep evolutionary timescales.
Aspects of this work will involve two study systems: 1)
A deep-time system encompassing symbiont lineages
from across the rove beetle subfamily Aleocharinae that
are separated by up to 100 million years. 2) A recently-
evolved system in which multiple rove beetle lineages
have convergently evolved symbioses with a single ant
genus in the South Western US. This latter project in-
volves potential eldwork at sites in Southern California
and Arizona. The successful candidate will spearhead
genome sequencing of free-living and symbiotic species
from across phylogeny, and use comparative genomic
tools to understand patterns of genome evolution. There
is potential for collaboration with Caltech labs using
machine learning and single cell proling, and the candi-
date will also lead genome/transcriptome assembly and
annotation of several higher quality reference genomes to
facilitate functional genetic studies in laboratory model
rove beetle species. Depending on the candidate, the
project may involve wet lab work to functionally test
loci with possible causal roles in symbiosis, or involve
collaboration with others to this end.

NCState PlantVirusHostAdaptation
Postdoc: Experimental evolution and phylodynamics of
plant virus emergence
A postdoctoral research position is available in the phy-
lodynamics research group led by David Rasmussen at
NC State University in the Bioinformatics Research
Centre and the Department of Entomology and Plant
Pathology. The main aim of the project is to under-
stand how vector-borne plant viruses adapt to new host
environments and expand their host range. Viral adap-
tation to new hosts will be studied in the lab, where we
can experimentally manipulate transmission between
dierent host species and regularly re-sequence viral
populations. To reveal the genetic basis of host adapta-
tion, experimental evolution studies will be combined
with newly developed phylodynamic methods for track-
ing the population dynamics of individual viral lineages
and quantifying their tness.Questions of interest include:
Do tness tradeos between hosts limit adaptation to
multiple hosts?
How do the tness eects of individual mutations vary
across hosts?
Can selection resolve tness tradeos (i.e. antagonistic
pleiotropy) and, if so, how?
Is the evolution of generalists constrained more by ge-
netic or by ecological factors like vector dynamics?
Applicants must hold a PhD in plant pathology or re-
lated eld of biology. Previous lab experience handling
plant viruses or other pathogens is highly desired. Ad-
ditional knowledge of data analysis in Python, R or
Matlab is also desired. Candidates with both wet lab
and bioinformatics skills will be given the highest con-
sideration, but is not essential. The candidate will also
be expected to publish and present their work at con-
ferences, help supervise students and may occasionally
be involved in grant writing. Most importantly, the
candidate must possess strong problem-solving skills
and a record of self-directed, innovative research.
Initial appointment is for one year, but renewable for up
to 3 years. Start date would ideally be Summer 2018.
To apply, please send a CV, a 1-2 page cover letter de-
scribing previous experience and research interests, and

ComparativeGenomicsRegulation
Postdoctoral fellow within comparative analysis of
genome regulation
The successful candidate will be funded through the
project \REWIRED", recently funded by the Norwe-April 1, 2018 EvolDir 87
gian Research Council FRIPRO program (2018-2021).
The project is addressing fundamental knowledge gaps
regarding the role of whole genome duplication in adap-
tive evolution, using salmonid sh as a model system.
Specically, our aim is to test if functional redundancy
in a duplicated genome spark evolution of novel adap-
tive functions. The candidate will also work in close
collaboration with a PhD-student funded through a sec-
ond FRIPRO funded project \TRANSPOSE", which
aims at understanding the importance of transposable
elements in the evolution of gene regulatory innovation.
A key element in this project is collaboration with Rori
Rohlfs at San Francisco State University and use her
computational framework (EVE) to assess the impor-
tance of whole genome duplication on adaptive evolution
of gene function. The candidate will therefore be ex-
pected to spend signicant time in the Rohlfs-lab during
the project.
The main tasks will be to: - Compile a multi-omics
(RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq) comparative dataset
from 10 sh species (wet-lab work will be carried out
by others). - Identify genes under adaptive evolution
using the EVE statistical framework. - Integrate anal-
yses of gene expression evolution with information on
transposable element activity and epigenetic marks to
understand the mechanistic drivers of gene regulation
evolution.

QMUL London
BirdSongCulturalEvolution
A Postdoctoral Research Assistant position is available
at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) as part of
a project funded by the BBSRC. The project 'Machine
learning for bird song learning' seeks to develop and
apply new methods for assessing the similarity between
complex bird song syllables, guided by the perception
of birds themselves, and to apply this to examine the
evolution of song learning behaviour.
This particular research position will play two key roles
in the project. First, you will lead the eort to use
operant conditioning techniques to examine how birds
judge the similarity of song syllables. This will involve
using existing operant conditioning techniques to ex-amine how zebra nches assess song syllable similarity.
It will also involve the development of new methods
(in collaboration with Dr Robert Lachlan) to carry out
operant conditioning with free-living wild birds. Second,
you will collate data-sets of song variation from free
living populations, and (again in collaboration with Dr
Lachlan) carry out comparative analyses using cultural
evolutionary simulations tted to data, and based on
song comparisons using our new methods in order to
compare processes of song learning between species. The
project will therefore allow you to develop skills in two
cutting edge areas of behavioural biology.
The project will require that you travel to collaborate
with project partners in the Netherlands (Wageningen)
and the UK (Cornwall).
The ideal candidate for this position should have a PhD
in animal behaviour and communication. Experience
in working with both captive and wild birds, in oper-
ant conditioning methods, and with evolutionary theory
would be desirable. A track record of peer-reviewed
publications is essential.
This is a full-time, xed term post available for a period
of 3 years. The start date is 1st June 2018. The salary
is in the range of 32,956 - 38,709 per annum and is inclu-
sive of London allowance. The salary will be dependent
on qualications, skills and experience.
Candidates must be able to demonstrate their eligibility
to work in the UK in accordance with the Immigration,
Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. Where required this
may include entry clearance or continued leave to remain

Research, Education, and Outreach
University of California 'V Santa Cruz
Summary:
UC Santa Cruz department of Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology (EEB) is recruiting one full-time postdoc-
toral scholar to perform environmental DNA (eDNA)
research and science education outreach. The position
is ideal for a candidate with a background in molecular
biology. In collaboration with project partners in the
department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB)
at UC Los Angeles, the postdoctoral scholar will help
establish a new education program called eSIE: environ-
mental DNA for Science Investigation and Education,
supported by a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute (HHMI) jointly awarded to UCSC and UCLA.
The scholar will work with a team of researchers and sci-
ence education experts on eDNA research that connects
to the eSIE program.
Why eDNA?
eDNA is a highly sensitive molecular approach to cata-
log biodiversity in any ecosystem. The results can reveal
a near complete diversity prole of the ecosystem from
microbes to plants and animals, and can enable track-
ing biodiversity changes over time. UCLA and UCSC
have pioneered cutting-edge methods to obtain eDNA
data, from citizen science to packaged computational
pipelines. Our goal with the eSIE program is to use
the excitement and wide application of eDNA as a new
gateway for students to enter research avenues in the
environmental sciences.
The postdoctoral role in the eSIE program:
The postdoctoral scholar will help co-develop and man-96 EvolDir April 1, 2018
age eSIE program while receiving training focused on
the advancement of science education. eSIE reaches
a broad undergraduate constituency by involving hun-
dreds of students annually in CALeDNA bioblitzes on
UC Natural Reserves (www.ucedna.com). The postdoc
will help select eld sampling, ideally around research
questions of their interest, and travel to do eld collec-
tions at natural reserves around the entire state. eSIE
will also launch a multidisciplinary ipped course to
introduce undergraduates formally to STEM subjects
through DNA and eDNA activities. The postdoc would
co-design the course with the eSIE team, and receive
training through the Center for Education Innovation
and Learning in the Sciences (https://ceils.ucla.edu) at
UCLA (remote learning possible). The eSIE program
also supports students who enter research labs. The
postdoc would be expected to occasionally work with
student research interns.
Research scope:
The postdoc will be encouraged to pursue environmen-
tal science research that uses the eSIE-generated eDNA
data and sample collections. They will join the lab group
of Beth Shapiro <https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/faculty/-
singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz id=bashapir >
(UCSC), who' ^As lab focuses on evolution, paleoge-
nomics, and conservation genomics. They will also join
the UC Conservation Genomics Consortium community
that conducts many eDNA projects.
Preparation:
Candidates should have a PhD in biology or a related
science eld and molecular biology laboratory experi-
ence evidenced by a strong record of scholarship. The
ideal candidate would have demonstrated interest or
some experience working in science communication and
education research, as well as undergraduate teaching

Post-doctoral position in Human Evolutionary Genet-
ics and Epigenetics, Laboratory of Connie Mulligan,
Department of Anthropology, Genetics Institute, Uni-
versity of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA
Post-doctoral position to work on two ongoing NSF and
internally funded projects: 1) Investigation of an epi-
genetic mechanism to mediate the eects of maternal
stress on maternal and infant health in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). We are testing for associa-
tions between maternal stress exposures, newborn healthApril 1, 2018 EvolDir 99
outcomes and changes in DNA methylation and gene
expression in mothers and their infants. More broadly,
we are interested in the idea that mechanisms may have
evolved to allow the genome to respond to psychosocial
stressors, specically behavior and complex phenotypes
may be shaped by early life experiences that alter gene
expression through epigenetic alterations. Samples and
data have already been collected and research is funded
by NSF. See http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/-
10.4161/epi.21180 and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/-
doi/10.1111/cdev.12487/epdf . 2) Investigation of ge-
netic, epigenetic, and biological signatures of war trauma
exposures and impact of a program intervention in Syr-
ian refugees. This is a collaboration with Catherine
Panter-Brick (Anthropology, Yale University) and Rana
Dajani (Hashemite University, Jordan) to integrate ge-
netic and epigenetic analyses into an ongoing study to
measure the eects of violence and trauma in Syrian
refugees. The rst project is an intergeneration study
to investigate the epigenetic impacts in ospring of
mothers and grandmothers who were exposed to war
trauma while pregnant. The overarching question is
to determine if trauma-induced methylation changes
are heritable across two generations in humans. In the
second project, genetic variants are being assayed to
predict the impact of past trauma exposures and the
eects of a program intervention on self-reported mental
health in Syrian refugee youth. Epigenetic variants will
be tested as possible mediators of the eect of stress on
mental health outcomes. See project website at http://-
www.elrha.org/map-location/yale-psychosocial-call2/ .
Qualications: A PhD, good publication record, and
strong background in the generation of genetic data
(microarray, gene expression, NGS, SNP detection) and
data analysis (gene association analysis, regression anal-
ysis, genetic ancestry estimation, linkage analysis, etc)
are essential. A background in evolutionary genetics
and experience with methylation data (Illumina chips,
pyrosequencing, etc), RNA sequence or gene expression
array data, and/or additional computational or bioin-
formatics experience is a plus. Candidates who speak
French or Swahili are encouraged to apply. In addition
to the projects listed above, there are excellent opportu-
nities for the successful candidate to develop new lines
of research as well as productive collaborations outside
the lab.
The University of Florida is one of the top 10 pub-

VirusEvolutionEpidemiology
Postdoctoral position in virus evolution and epidemiol-
ogy
A 2.5-year postdoc position in available in the research
group of Roman Biek in the Institute of Biodiversity,
Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the Uni-
versity of Glasgow.
We are looking for a computational biologist interested
in pathogen evolution and epidemiology to work on a
project aimed at uncovering the role of evolutionary
and environmental factors in virus emergence, spread
and persistence, using bluetongue virus (BTV) as the
study system. BTV is an RNA virus responsible for a
globally important vector-borne disease in domestic and
wild ungulates that has made repeated incursions into
Europe in recent decades. Previous work in our group
has highlighted the importance of genomic reassortment
(Nomikou et al., 2015) and of large-scale environmen-
tal variability in the spread of European BTV strains
(Jacquot et al. 2017). The aim of the current project
is to study dynamics of BTV emergence and transmis-
sion, and the underlying mechanisms, at the scale of
individual outbreaks through the integrated analysis of
genomic, spatial and temporal data. The post is funded
as part of a large European research consortium entitled
\Understanding pathogen, livestock, and environment
interactions involving bluetongue virus" (PALE-Blu,
http://www.palebludata.com).
The applicant should have a PhD in a relevant eld of
biology or bioinformatics. Previous experience in com-
putational analysis of genetic sequence data and strong
quantitative skills will be essential, ideally including
familiarity with high-throughput sequencing and large
genomic data sets. The genetic data will be generated
through project collaborators, so the work is exclusivelyfocussed on data analysis and no lab skills are required.
Knowledge of epidemiological models, phylodynamic ap-
proaches, and pathogen evolution would be desirable but
not essential. The candidate should be self-motivated
and be able to work independently and have excellent
communication skills. In addition to drafting scientic
papers, the candidate would be expected to present at
scientic conferences and manage collaborations with
project partners.
Salary will be on the Research & Teaching Grade, level
6/7 - 28,098 - 31,604/34,520 - 38,833 per annum.
This post is available immediately (though exact start-
ing time is negotiable) and is oered on a full time and
open-ended basis with funding to October 2020.
Potential applicants are encouraged to make in-
formal inquiries to roman.biek@glasgow.ac.uk.
Formal applications need to be submitted under

*Project description* Birds are one of the most charis-
matic and well-studied group of animals, yet we
know very little about how humans have aected
their global patterns of diversity and evolutionary
history. This project is part of a larger initiative
funded by the Swedish Research Council titled \Is
biodiversity understandable from contemporary dis-
tributions?" with Sren Faurby (goo.gl/9S6nuP) as
a PI and Tim Blackburn (goo.gl/9LWXfk; a bird
macro-ecologist at University College London) and
Manuel Steinbauer (goo.gl/UEiG7T; an island biologist
at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N urnberg)
as co-applicants. The work will involve close col-
laboration with this team as well as additional re-
searchers at Gothenburg University, especially mem-
bers of the Antonelli Lab (http://antonelli-lab.net/).

868.short; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/-
ecog.02287/abstract). The goal of this project is to
investigate whether those biases are restricted to mam-
mals (which could be particularly sensitive to anthro-
pogenic impacts), or are more general and aect otherorganisms.
*Job assignments* - Retrieving and analyzing informa-
tion on the taxonomy of extinct birds - Estimating
and analysing potential present-natural distribution of
all bird species and the dierences between these and
contemporary patterns

for 18 months. The physical placement will be at the
University of Gothenburg, Department of Biological and
EnvironmentalScience but may include shorter stays at
University College London or Friedrich-Alexander Uni-
versity Erlangen-N urnberg.
*Eligibility* The applicant must hold a PhD in an area
relevant for the tasks at hand (macroecology, ornithol-
ogy, spatial analysis, macroevolution, palaeontology, or
related elds). Note that the thesis must be awarded
prior to the Closing date of this position.
*Necessary qualications* - Documented capacity to
work in groups and independently - Advanced skills in
R or potentially another analytical platform - Excellent
communication skills, written and spoken, in English are
necessary since we work in an international environment.
*Desirable qualications* - A strong publication record
(relative to the applicants' scientic age) - Experience
with handling and ideally generating large databases -
Experience with spatial and macro-evolutionary analy-
ses - Knowledge of the study group (birds) - Experience
in palaeontology and or taxonomy
*The application should be written in English and must
include:* - A cover letter with the applicant's justi-
cation for the application which describes how the
applicant meets the selection criteria and potentially
her/his plans for this project (max. two A4 pages) - A
list of qualications (full CV) - Certicate of PhD exam
and other relevant education - Complete list of publi-
cations, including submitted and accepted manuscripts
highlighting the up to ve most important papers re-
lated to the application - Contact information for at
least two referees that are familiar with the applicant's
work - A single pdf including all the documents above
for easier evaluation

to novel DNA datasets via collaborative projects.
We are looking for a computational biologist to analyze
novel ancient human genomic datasets to further char-
acterize how humans peopled regions such as the Pacic
or the Americas. The main project for this position
includes the coordination of data generation (poten-
tially including eld trips), data analysis with existing
computational methods as well as extensive simulations
for validations of results. Depending on interests and
skill sets, the candidate could also decide to develop
novel computational methods to characterize evolution-
ary processes relying on time serial data. Finally it is
possible to set some time aside for i) a personal side

EvolutionaryGenomicsNeurogenetics
A postdoc position is available within the lab of Roman
Arguello at University of Lausanne's (UNIL) Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution.
We are a newly formed lab interested in understand-
ing the genetic and neural bases of sensory evolution.
We take a very interdisciplinary approach that bridges
computational/comparative genomics with neurogenet-
ics. Our model organisms are diverse Drosophila species
from around the globe, and we are particularly interested
in the evolution of neural circuits and in the evolution-
ary processes related to the rapid changes underlying
olfaction and temperature preference.
The specic focus for this position will be on olfactory
evolution. The projects will relate repeated gains/losses
in olfactory receptors to the evolution of their protein
sequences, to their neural circuits, and to behavior.
This work will test hypotheses about how the olfac-
tory system evolves, and to what extent these changes
are repeatable. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature
of the research, there is a range of opportunities for
contributing to the projects depending on particular
interests and strengths (i.e. comparative/population
genomics, neurobiology, generation of transgenic tools
for new species).
Qualication include a PhD in genetics, evolutionary
biology, neurobiology, or a related eld, the ability to
be self-motivated and to work independently as well
as within a small group, good communication skills,
comfortable with public presentations, and the ability
to clearly document work. Additionally, expertise with
several of the following tasks is required, and an inter-
est/willingness to learn some of the others:
- molecular evolution and/or population genomic anal-
yses - statistics and next-generation sequence analy-
ses (programming/scripting in one or more languages
such as Python, Perl, R, etc.) - molecular biology
(CRISPR/Cas9 vector designs) - electrophysiology -
histochemistry/microscopy (dissecting, tissue prepara-
tions, antibody staining, uorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion, confocal imaging) - y genetics and maintenance -
y embryo injections for generating transgenic lines and
screening
This is a 100% position for an initial duration of one year,renewable up to 2 or 3 years depending on the start date
and funding available. The position is dedicated primar-
ily to research, however some contribution to teaching
is expected, including the possibility of assisting with
the supervision of master students.
The Department of Ecology and Evolution is a lively,
fun, productive, and highly diverse group. While UNIL
is a French-speaking university, the working language of
the Department and the Lab is English. For more infor-
mation about the Department of Ecology and Evolution

ULausanne MelaninEvolution
Evolution and coevolution of melanogenic genes
Melanin is the most widespread pigment in organisms.
Synthesis of melanin occurs all across the tree of life,
including in Eubacteria, Eukaryota, fungi, plants and
animals and, perhaps, Archaea. The widespread ca-
pacity of life to synthesize melanin indicates the bio-
logical importance of this pigment, possibly from the
very early stages of life. Melanins and pigmentations
based on them are targets of intense research, particu-
larly in animals and disparate elds such as oncology,
biotechnology, evolutionary biology and ecology. From106 EvolDir April 1, 2018
an evolutionary perspective, there is increasing evidence
that the expression of melanin-based coloration is often
linked to other aspects of an individual's phenotype.
Approximately 120 genes are known to be involved in
the production of melanin. However, the rate at which
these genes evolved and coevolved throughout the tree
of life is unknown. In the present project, we propose
to investigate the molecular evolution of melanogenic
genes. Specically, the goal is to determine the events
of positive and purifying selection as well as how the
dierent genes coevolved.
Please see Dib L, San-Jose Garcia L, Ducrest A-L,

color gene melanocortin-1-receptor shaped the evolution
of the melanocortin system genes. International Journal
of Molecular Sciences 18, 2618.

EvolutionDrugResistanceMalaria
A postdoc position is available in the lab of Nicole Mideo,
in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Toronto. The position is part of
an NIH-funded study of drug resistance in malaria par-
asites. The aim of the project is to use longitudinal
amplicon sequencing data to look for phenotypic signa-
tures of resistance in malaria infections, i.e., variants
with increasing relative abundance over the course of
treatment.
The successful candidate will be involved in developing
approaches for analysing (and ultimately analysing) rel-
ative abundance time series data. The ideal candidate
will have experience analysing such data in any context.112 EvolDir April 1, 2018
A PhD in ecology, evolution, biology or a related eld
is required.
Collaborators on this grant have been collecting data
from malaria clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, so that we
can contribute to identifying drug resistant parasites
and tracking their spread globally. One key challenge
in these areas is that most infections harbour multiple
parasite genotypes, and when resistance is rare (and
its underlying genetics unknown) its eects are hard to
detect. More background for this project can be found
in some of our previously published papers, including
an opinion piece outlining the challenge of within-host
diversity as well as potential approaches for overcoming
it (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/-
S1471492213000767) and an analysis of previously col-
lected data (https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/-
2016/1/21/2802531).
The position is available for 2 years, subject to annual
review. The expected start date is July 1, 2018, but
there is exibility on that.
To apply, please send (1) a cover letter outlining your pre-
vious experiences that make you suited for this position
as well as your research and career goals (2) a CV, and
(3) contact information for three people who can provide
a reference via email to nicole.mideo@utoronto.ca.

KelpGenomics
Post-Doctoral Research Associate
The Department of Biological Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is currently ac-
cepting application submissions for a postdoctoral ap-
pointment in Dr. Filipe Alberto's laboratory, study-
ing genetic improvement for aquaculture of the gi-
ant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. This is part of a

item/department-energy-announces-18- new-projects-
accelerate-development-macroalgae-production).
The postdoc will be conducting the development of a
germplasm collection of haploid strains of kelp (brown
algae). The collection will be the basis for a genetic
improvement program aimed at faster growth; and tem-
perature and low nutrient tolerance in aquaculture. The
postdoc will contribute to routine culture tasks, but
mostly through supervision of a research assistant and
undergraduate students. Experience in growing kelp
cultures in the laboratory conditions is preferable but
not essential, training can be provided.
Preferred skills: Experience with genomic analysis,
both wet and dry lab, including the analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data, coding experience in R,
Python or other languages and excellent organizational
skills and capacity to work under strict deadlines.

netics/genomics or genetics. Familiarity with population
genetics/genomics software is essential, as well as high-
level of motivation to publish results, as evidenced by
the candidate's publication record.
During the rst year, most project tasks will involve
cultivation of individual haploid strains to provide su-
cient biomass to extract DNA in quantity and quality
required for genomic analysis. Microsatellite marker
analysis will also be used to monitor strain identify and
purity at dierent stages of growth. The germplasm col-
lection will be the basis for a Marker Assisted Selection
program developed with partner institutions (UC Santa
Barbara, U Southern California and JCVI) involving
genome sequencing and annotation, phenotype typing of
outplanted sporophytes in Southern California, capture
sequencing of genetic variants (SNP) and the estimation
of a predictive model linking genotype and phenotype
for traits of interest.
Other broad research interests in the Alberto lab are
population genetics and evolutionary ecology of sea-
weeds and marine plants. Our focus is both on em-
pirical research through the acquisition of population
genetics data, using molecular marker techniques, and
simulation-based hypothesis testing.
Informal inquiries about the project are encouraged.
Please apply by sending a pdf document including 1)
CV, 2) a declaration of research interests, 3) previous
experience and t for the position and 4) the email

\Structural Equation Modelling for Ecologists and Evo-

This course will be delivered by Jon Lefcheck (who
wrote the SEM package piecewise) and will take place
from 18th - 22nd June 2018 at Myuna Bay sport and
recreation, Australia.
Full details can be found using the link below.
http://bit.ly/2Ga0yk4SEM OZ Course Overview: The
course is a primer on structural equation modelling
(SEM) and conrmatory path analysis, with an em-
phasis on practical skills and applications to real-world
data. Structural equation modelling is a rapidly growing
technique in ecology and evolution that unites multiple
hypotheses in a single causal network. It provides an
intuitive graphical representation of relationships among
variables, underpinned by well-described mathematical
estimation procedures. Several advances in SEM over
the past few years have expanded its utility for typical
ecological datasets, which include count data, missing
observations, and nested or hierarchical designs.
We will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide
approachable mathematical explanations of the tech-
niques, and cover recent extensions to mixed eects
models and non-normal distributions. Along the way,
we will work through many examples from the primary
literature using the open-source statistical software R
(www.r-project.org). We will draw on two popular R
packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan and
piecewiseSEM. Participants are encouraged to bring
their own data, as there will be opportunities through-
out the course to plan, analyze, and receive feedback on
structural equation models.

Dr. Amine Namouchi (University of Oslo (Norway))
Overview This course will introduce biologists to the
main bioinformatic tools for the analysis of Next Gen-
eration Sequencing (NGS) data from ancient samples.
Through a series of theoretical and practical hands-on
sessions, the main goal of this course is to provide a clear
understanding of the most common bioinformatic meth-
ods adopted in a wide range of paleogenomics projects
(from metagenomic screening of ancient samples, to NGS
reads mapping and phylogenetic tree reconstruction).
Particular attention will be given to quality control,
DNA damage assessment and variants calling. A basic
introduction to NGS platforms and the main le formats
used in most common bioinformatics pipelines will be
provided. Each day will consist of a mix of introductory
lectures on the theoretical background of the programs
that will be used, followed by hands-on exercises using
command line tools performed by the participants under
guided supervision.
Target Audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND Thecourse is aimed primarily at researchers (MSc and PhD
students, postdoctoral fellows, engineers) interested in
learning the dierent steps from NGS raw data analy-
sis to phylogenetic tree reconstruction in archaeological
samples. The hands-on sessions are targeted to be-
ginners and more advanced users alike. The practical
sessions will cover the most common pipelines adopted
in paleogenomics, and can be applied to a wide range
of projects, from metagenomics to genome resequenc-
ing. Attendees should have a background in biology and
some familiarity with genomic data.
STRUCTURE The course material will be delivered
over 5 days, in 10 half-day sessions. These lessons will
build o of one another, and feature a mix of lecture
and in-class exercises.

Overview
Next generation sequencing has revolutionized evolu-
tionary biology allowing unprecedented resolution and
insight into evolutionary questions that appeared in-
tractable only a few years ago. The course will cover
the basics of population genomic analysis from SNP
data onwards and will cover the key analyses that may
be required to successfully analyze a population ge-
netic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-
nomic analysis and be comp etent in population genomic
analysis.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This workshop is aimed at postgraduate students and
early career researchers who are interested in using pop-
ulation genomic tools in their research. No previous
experience of bioinformatics is required, but an under-
pinning in evolutionary biology and basic population
genetics concepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
and FST are desirable. The course will use a range of
software including the Linux operating system and R.
TEACHING FORMAT
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists of
a combination of lectures and practical exercises, with

Dr. Filippo Biscarini (CNR, ITA) ( https://-
www.researchgate.net/prole/Filippo Biscarini )
Overview
This course will introduce students, researchers and pro-
fessionals into the eld of using genomics data to identify
meaningful genomic regions. The course comprises two
approaches: one based only on genomic information,
which will use populations genetics techniques to detect
signatures of selection (both natural and articial); the
other approach will combine genomic and phenotypic
data to identify genetic associations for specic pheno-
types (i.e. GWAS, genome-wide association studies).
Format
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Eachday will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning how to make
use of genomic information to study how selection has
shaped the genome and how the genome inuences mea-
surable phenotypes. It will include information useful
for both beginners and more advanced users. We will
start by introducing general concepts of population ge-
netics, which will take up most of the rst half of the
course; the second half of the course will be centered
mainly on GWAS and related aspects.
Attendees should have a background in biology, specif-
ically genetics. There will be a mix of lectures and
hands-on practical exercises using R and the Linux
command line, and bespoke software. Some basic under-
standing of R programming and the Linux environment
will be advantageous. Attendees should have also some
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments, including genotyping-by-sequencing
(GBS), and commercial genotyping platforms.

\Transposable elements" course.
Where: Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Mu-
seum Berlin, Freie Universit ~A^At Berlin, Konigin-Luise-
Stra~A^Ae 6-8, 14195 Berlin
When: 23-27 April 2018
Spots available: 4
Instructor: Dr. Alexander Suh (Uppsala University
(Sweden)) (https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-
J4CG5QAAAAJ&hl ~A )
Overview
Transposable elements (TEs) are selsh genetic elements
which exist in virtually all eukaryotic genomes. Because
TEs contain regulatory or coding sequence for their own
'survival' and often occur in large numbers within a
genome, they can have strong eects on the transcrip-
tion or methylation of nearby genes and signicantly
promote structural variation or genome size expansion.
Accurate annotation of TEs is thus important for many
studies in genomics and evolutionary biology. However,
TEs are rapidly evolving due to arms races with their
host genomes and thus often remain undetected in newly
sequenced genomes. One may argue that in-depth anno-
tation of TEs is currently one of the biggest bottlenecks
in genomics research of non-model organisms. This is
because computational TE analyses require knowledge
of TE biology as well as some degree of manual cura-
tion to overcome incomplete or erroneous annotations.
The present course aims to adress this bottleneck by
teaching TE biology, computational analyses of TEs
in genome assemblies (RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker)
and raw read data (dnaPipeTE), and manual analyses
of TEs (consensus curation, classication).
Format
At the end of this course, attendants should be able to
conduct computational analyses of TEs, interpret the
results in the light of TE biology, and improve TE anno-
tations through manual curation. To achieve this, the
rst three days of the course will provide lectures and
practicals on all these topics. The last two days of the
course consist entirely of supervised individual practicals
to further rene the attendants' skills in computational
and manual analyses of TEs, either in their own dataor in a course-specic collaborative project. Participa-
tion in the collaborative project will be acknowledged
through co-authorship on a planned TE manuscript.

The use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of molecular sequences is a vital
part of biological research. These methods underpin
studies on the evolution and epidemiology of plant and
animal parasites and disease-causing organisms, and
more generally they allow an objective analysis of the
patterns and processes generating biological diversity.
To carry out phylogenetic analysis properly, it is neces-
sary to have a good understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the key methods and approaches. This
EMBO Practical Course has been designed to provide
the theoretical and practical skills needed to carry out
state-of-the-art phylogenetic analyses.
The past few years have seen have an explosion in
new methods of analysis including the application of
Bayesian analysis methods in phylogeny reconstruction,
the development of improved non-homogeneous models
that much better represent the dynamics of sequence
evolution, and the development of methods for high-
throughput genome-wide analyses. This EMBO Practi-
cal Course has been designed to cater for these newest
of methods and for understanding how they relate to
the more traditional methods. Our goal is to teach
technical sophistication without losing sight of the need
for a critical attitude to data and analyses.

De novo assembly of transcriptomes using HPC re-
sources workshop
Hosted by The National Center for Genome Analysis
Support at Indiana University
The National Center for Genome Analysis Support, or
NCGAS, at Indiana University is oering a National
Science Foundation-sponsored, two-day workshop on
high performance computing usage and de novo tran-
scriptome assembly. It will take place April 30-May 1
on the IU Bloomington campus.
The workshop will include discussions, lectures, and
hands-on tutorials to cover topics important to getting
started constructing and analyzing transcriptomes^ a euro
\without the use of a genome. Material will cover both
the availability and use of high performance computing
(HPC) resources, alongside the task of assembling a new
transcriptome, in order to provide a more comprehensive
preparation for this and future bioinformatic tasks.
Transcriptome assembly will consist of using four sepa-
rate assemblers (Trinity, SOAP de novo, Velvet Oases,
and TransABySS), with multiple kmers, to be com-
bined and curated with Evigenes. This combined as-
sembly with multiple parameters is considered much
more robust than simply using one assembler, and the
NCGAS pipeline streamlines the process and allows for
customization if desired.
While material will make heavy use of XSEDE and IU
machines, the material is transferable to any cluster.

ForestTreeGenomics Jun4-7
Training course 'From genotypes to phenotypes: as-
sessing forest tree diversity in the wild' 4-7 June 2018
Kaunas, Lithuania
Assessing how genetic diversity at potentially adaptive
loci is structured in natural forest tree populations is a
complex matter. Demographic processes and natural se-
lection interact to produce genomic signatures that need
to be disentangled. Single nucleotide polymorphisms,
SNPs, are the most common type of genetic variation
among living organisms. Studies based on SNP geno-
typing in trees, in particular on variation underlying
adaptive traits, is an expanding research eld which will
help understand how trees adapt to climate change.
The course will show how genomic data sets can be
analyzed to yield information on how environmental fac-
tors shape local adaptation and how genomic variation
aect phenotypic diversity and how this can be used in
breeding programs.
Main topics of the course include: - Genomics: from
theory to practice - SNP genotyping - Statistical anal-
ysis of molecular data (methods and software) - High
throughput phenotyping for association studies - Mea-
suring and analyzing variability at potentially adaptive
genes.
The lectures are based on datasets, analyses and prelim-
inary results from research conducted within GenTree
project. The last day of the course will be spent in
the eld to acquire experience with drone-based phe-
notyping. Nice weather, beautiful forests and good
atmosphere are guaranteed!
Venue: Faculty of Forest Science and Ecology, Aleksan-
dras Stulginskis University, Student str. 11, LT-53361

Lecturers: Santiago Gonzalez-Martinez (INRA, France),
Tanja Pyhajarvi (University of Oulu, Finland) ), Se-
bastian Richter (University of Marburg, Germany),

The course is intended for PhD students and early-stage
researchers in forestry, ecology and forest genetics. The
content will be tailored to the background and experi-
ence of applicants.To participate: The course is designed for a maximum
of 20 participants, who will be selected based on their
background and motivation. Lectures, food and accom-

24 August 2018 at the CNRS campus in Montpel-
lier*, right after the Evolution 2018 meeting (http://-
evolutionmontpellier2018.org/).
The summer school aims at fostering the study of adap-
tation genomics and evolutionary genetics in a variety
of systems and using diverse approaches (e.g., popula-
tion genomics, life-history analyses, statistical inference
based on population and quantitative genetic theory,
landscape genomics, GWAS, and Evolve & Resequence
experiments). The school is organized by the Euro-
pean *Drosophila* Population Genomics Consortium
(DrosEU) and sponsored by the European Society for
Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) and the Mediterranean
Center for the Environment and for Biodiversity (CE-
MEB). Although DrosEU focuses on *Drosophila*, the
research questions, methodological approaches and the
conceptual issues addressed by the consortium apply
to many species beyond the *Drosophila *model. Our
two-day mini-summer school will gather approximately
60 people, especially students and postdocs from within
and outside the DrosEU community, as well as invited
speakers who are leaders in the eld. We will have
sessions with 6 invited speakers (each with a 1-hr talk,
followed by 30 min of discussion) and 6 contributed
PhD/postdoc presentations (20 min plus 10 min of dis-
cussion). By bringing together empiricists and theo-April 1, 2018 EvolDir 129

Dear colleagues,
We are happy to announce that registration is now open
for our summer school \Taming the BEAST".
Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in
modern biology. Phylogenetic inferences reconstruct the
evolutionary relationships between organisms, whereas
phylodynamic inferences reveal the dynamics that leadto the observed relationships. These two elds have
many practical applications in disciplines such as epi-
demiology, developmental biology, paleontology, ecology
and even linguistics. However, phylogenetics and phylo-
dynamics are complex and fast-evolving elds. As such,
inference tools are not easily accessible to researchers
who are not from a computational background.
Taming the BEAST is a summer school focusing on the
BEAST2 software and consisting of a mix of invited
talks, lectures and hands-on tutorials by leading and
renowned experts in the eld (including several of the
core developers of BEAST2). The aim of this summer

\Phylogenetic comparative methods for studying diversi-
cation and phenotypic evolution (PCME01)"
Full details can be found at the link below.
http://bit.ly/2FFjB6sPHYLOGENETIC COMPARITIVE METHODS PHENOTYPIC EVOLUTION
This course will run from the 22nd - 25th October
2018 in Glasgow City Centre and will be delivered by
Dr. Antigoni Kaliontzopoulou.
Course Overview: Phylogenetic comparative methods
are commonly used nowadays to investigate how species
diversication occurs and to test hypotheses about the
mechanisms that drive phenotypic evolution, e.g. to
model speciation and extinction, to understand why
some groups are more diverse than others, to test
whether phenotypic traits have evolved under neutral,
directional or diversifying selection, to investigate howevolutionary rates are modied across the evolutionary
history of a group etc. In all these cases, a phyloge-
netic hypothesis for the group of interest is combined
to phenotypic and ecological data at the species level to
understand the tempo and mode of evolutionary change.
The objective of this course is to provide an overview of
these methods and of the tools avaipracticalsle for their
implementation in the R statistical language. During
theoretical sessions, we will review the main concepts
and statistical tools necessary for testing hypotheses
about species diversication and phenotypic evolution.
These will then be implemented in practical practicals
sessions through worked examples to provide the partic-
ipants with hands-on experience on data management
and the implementation of these methods to real biolog-
ical data.

Quantitative geographic ecology using R: modelling
genomes, niches, and communities (QGER01)
Delivered by Dan Warren and Matt Fitzpatrick, this
course will take place in Glasgow city centre from 30th
April - 4th May
Full details can be found at
www.prstatistics.com/course/quantitative-geographic-
ecology-using-r-modelling-genomes-niches-and-
communities-qger01/ Course Overview: Spatial
modelling is increasingly being used in ecology and
evolutionary biology for both basic and applied research
questions. While emphasis traditionally has been on
species-level niche modelling, the increasing availability
of genomic and community-level data has increased
interest in modelling biodiversity patterns above and
below the species level. This 5-day course will provide
a thorough introduction to dierent spatial modelling
techniques for quantifying and visualizing patterns of
biodiversity across scales of biological organization
'V from population-level genetic variation, to speciesecological niches, to communities. Students will learn
about theory, common data types, and statistical
techniques used in these dierent applications.
The course will include introductory lectures, guided
computer coding in R, and exercises for the participants,
with an emphasis on visualization and reproducible
workows. All modelling and data manipulation will
be performed with R. Attendees will learn to use niche
modelling algorithms including Maxent, GLM, GAM,
and others, and will learn both new and existing meth-
ods for conducting comparative studies using ENMs in
the new ENMTools R package. Generalized Dissimilar-
ity Modelling (GDM) and Gradient Forest (GF) will
be taught for modelling genomic and community-level
data. The course is intended for intermediate R users
with interest in quantitative geographical ecology.
After successfully completing this course students will:
1) Understand the theory underlying ENMs and the
critical assumptions necessary to the modelling pro-
cess. 2) Be able to develop, evaluate, and apply ENMs
both in the context of conservation-oriented studies and
to study niche evolution. 3) Understand the statisti-
cal underpinnings of GDM and GF 4) Be able to de-
velop, evaluate and apply GDM and GF for quantifying
and mapping spatial genetic patterns and community-
level compositional variation 5) Assess population- and
community-level vulnerability to climate change

*MODELLING SPATIAL ECO-EVOLUTIONARY DY-
NAMICS AND SPECIES' RESPONSES TO ENVI-
RONMENTAL CHANGES*
*23-24 & 26-27 April 2018 (CIBIO-UP)*
Rapid environmental change threatens biodiversity and
exposes species to novel ecological and evolutionary pres-
sures. The scientic community increasingly recognizes
the need for dynamic mechanistic models integrating
sucient complexity to forecast the response of natural
populations to drivers of global change, such as habitat
fragmentation or climate change.
In this Advanced Course hosted by CIBIO-University of
Porto (UP) students will rst learn fundamental issues
to apply spatially-explicit eco-evolutionary models to
address biotic responses to anthropic and/or environ-
mental changes. Secondly, we will introduce a novel
modelling platform, *RangeShifter v2.0*, which inte-
grates population dynamics, dispersal behaviour and
evolutionary processes in a spatially-explicit context.
Using some illustrative examples, we will show dierent
functionalities for a wide variety of modelling appli-
cations ranging from applied to theoretical questions.
Thirdly, we will present new functionalities recentlyincorporated into Rangeshifter v2.0, namely: *(i)* a
genetics module and *(ii)* dynamic landscapes. Fi-
nally, we will discuss future potential functionalities to
be incorporated into Rangeshifter v2.0 including *(i)*
the possibility of accommodating plant traits, such as
selng or pollen dispersal kernels and *(ii)* to address
eco-evolutionary changes in marine environments.
To take the most of this course, it is highly advisable
that participants bring their own spatial datasets (ide-
ally as shapeles in a projected co-ordinate system) to
discuss with the instructors the most suitable way to
apply *Rangeshifter v2.0* to address their own study
issues.

This new course is designed to provide attendees at any
career stage with a theoretical understanding of the
methods used in conservation genomics along with the
practical skills necessary to design and carry out the
analysis component of a conservation genomics study.
While introduction to the theoretical aspects of each
of the analytical steps will be given, the emphasis of
the course will be on hands-on training, enabling the
participants to complete the analysis steps behind a
conservation genomics study. Thus, the course will
follow the format of short lectures introducing each
analytical step, followed by hands-on activities during
which students will complete the corresponding analysis.
The course will begin with an overview of conserva-
tion genomics, comparison of dierent next generation
sequencing platforms, and the analytical factors to con-
sider when beginning a conservation genomics study.
The rest of the course will focus on the bioinformatics
analysis behind a conservation study including: genome
assembly (trimming, assembly techniques, quality as-
sessment), genome annotation, mapping low coverage
genome data to a reference genome, SNP calling, de-
mographic analysis, and estimation of genome-wide di-
versity. These steps will all be accomplished with real
data used in a recent conservation genomics study and
performed on the Smithsonian High Performance Com-
puting Cluster (SI/HPC). By the end of the course,
attendees will have acquired the necessary background
and applied knowledge to implement genomic analyses
for the conservation of endangered species.
The Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation is a
partnership between George Mason University and the
Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). All
courses are intensive residential programs hosted in
a sustainably-built Academic Center on the grounds
of SCBI in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. All courses

in cancer (e.g. generation of diversity, driver muta-
tions, epistasis, selective pressures, cellular co-operation
and competition, units of selection). * Describe the
principles from ecology relevant to studying tumour mi-
croenvironments. * Develop prociency with the tools
for measuring the evolution and ecology of tumours. *
Evaluate those tools and metrics used to measure ecosys-
tems and evolution that can be applied to cancer. *
Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of cancer prog-
nostics, particularly evolutionary prognostics * Apply
evolutionary and ecological approaches to the problem
of therapeutic resistance.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword140 EvolDir April 1, 2018
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
