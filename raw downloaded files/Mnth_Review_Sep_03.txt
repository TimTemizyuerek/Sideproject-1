Human Biology: an evolutionary perspective
University of Montpellier II, France December 1-2-3,
2003
Website and call for presentations: http:/-
/www.isem.univ-montp2.fr/GE/meeting site/-
human biology.htm
Purpose and scope: Evolutionary biology is now invad-
ing new territories, and numerous scientiﬁc areas are
experiencing breakthroughs due to reconsideration in
an evolutionary perspective... This is particularly true
for the scientiﬁc study of man : sociology, anthropology,
ethnology, medicine, physiology, dietetics, psychiatry,
economics, law, politics, theology, etc.
What has been achieved so far is probably just the tip of
the iceberg, and a major change in the understanding ofSeptember 1, 2003 EvolDir 5
ourselves and of our social world is probably underway.
This workshop is dedicated to present an up to date
overview of some of these revisited human topics. It is
particularly devoted to scientists and graduate students
already familiar with evolutionary biology. It is also ad-
dressed to everyone interested by stimulating ideas on
human biology and ecology, which are based on ﬁrm
scientiﬁc grounds (Darwinian evolution).

The 7th International Meeting “Molecular Epidemi-
ology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Dis-
eases” (MEEGID VII) will be held in Valencia ( http:/-
/www.valencia-on-line.com/ ), Spain, 19th-23rd July
2004. As for the 6 ﬁrst MEEGID meetings, it will
be co-organized by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/ ) in At-
lanta, the Centre National de la Recherche Scien-
tiﬁque (CNRS; http://www.cnrs.fr/ ) and the Institut
de Recheche pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD; http://-
www.ird.fr/ ) in France.
MEEGID VII will be hosted by the 9th European
Multicolloquium of Parasitology (EMOP IX; http://-
www.uv.es/emop9/ ). Several sessions will be organized
in common by the 2 meetings.
The MEEGID meetings are organized in synergy with
the new journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution (El-
sevier; http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/meegid ), which
scientiﬁc topic is identical to that of the MEEGID.
Launched less than 2 years ago, Infection, Genetics and
Evolution is now published with 6 issues per year, and
is covered by Medline and Index Medicus, starting from
the 1st issue.
Communications on genetics, genomics, proteomics,
population biology, mathematical modelling, bioinfor-
matics are welcome. They can deal with the host,
the pathogen or the vector. Papers considering host
+ pathogen or pathogen + vector (co-evolution) are
particularly encouraged. All pathogens are within
the scope of MEEGID: viruses, parasitic protozoa,
helminths, fungal organisms, prion. All infectious mod-
els can be considered, including those of veterinary or
agronomical relevance.
The papers communicated for MEEGID VII will be
published in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and
Evolution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002). MEEGID VII will include 10-15 plenary lec-
tures, about 20 specialized symposia, 12-15 “express-6 EvolDir September 1, 2003
debates” (20 mn presentation by only one speaker fol-
lowed by 40 mn free discussion) and several poster ses-
sions.
Awards will be attributed to the best communication,
the best communication by a student and the best com-
munication by a scientist from the Southern World on
a problem speciﬁcally relevant to these areas.

We are currently seeking up to 3 students with inter-
ests in genomics, evolution and bioinformatics to con-
duct research on microsatellite evolution. Positions are
available immediately for a period of 3 years.
Project Description Microsatellites are abundant,
highly variable, repeated DNA sequences that are re-
garded as the most versatile genetic markers yet discov-
ered. They are the cornerstone of the current biological
revolution and are used in gene mapping, DNA forensic
work, and as population markers. Conclusions drawn
from such studies in many cases depend critically on
assumptions about how microsatellites evolve. Currentmodels of microsatellite evolution are overly simplistic
and almost certainly incorrect, leading to widespread
data misinterpretation. To avoid continued misinter-
pretation, it is vital that we understand fully how mi-
crosatellites evolve. This project will investigate the
processes governing microsatellite evolution by compar-
ing microsatellite sequences derived from the human,
mouse, rat and other genome projects using a com-
bination of bioinformatics and comparative molecular
genetics.
The Ideal Candidate The ideal candidate will possess
experience in both molecular genetics and bioinformat-
ics. They will be motivated and organised, with a
demonstrated capacity to master the broad skill set nec-
essary for the successful completion of a research pro-
gram that will span molecular genetics, bioinformatics
and biomathematics. They will be a competent labo-
ratory worker, with experience of all routine molecular
genetic techniques, particularly microsatellite genotyp-
ing and sequencing, and should be computer literate
with familiarity with database management and statis-
tical analyses. Minimum qualiﬁcations: B.Sc. (Hons),8 EvolDir September 1, 2003
M.Sc. in Genetics, Molecular Biology or equivalent.
Remuneration Students will receive an annual stipend
of NZ$19,000 plus local fees for 3 years. Please note
that students from countries other than New Zealand,
Germany, France, and Australia will normally be re-
quired to pay international fees currently NZ$23,000
per annum which will not be covered by the stipend.
Additional scholarships for international fees are avail-
able, but only to the very best international graduates.
Interested applicants are encouraged to make informal
enquires to Dr. Neil Gemmell, in the ﬁrst instance. To
apply, please send your Curriculum Vitae, a copy of
your academic transcript and the names of three refer-
ees with a covering letter to:

3-year PhD student position in Statistical Genetics.
This position is available to work with Mikko J. Sil-
lanp¨ a¨ a on the development of statistical methods to
combine information from several sources into a sin-
gle large probabilistic gene mapping analysis. Infor-
mation sources considered in the statistical analysis
are genomic information provided by large sequencing
projects (e.g. Human Genome Project), phenotypic
trait measurements, multilocus markers, and gene ex-
pression microarrays. Probabilistic Bayesian inferential
machinery will be adopted for modeling and analytic
purposes. An algorithmic Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulation is utilized in numerical implementation. The
developed new methods are put publicly available on
the net as software packages.

NewportOR MolGenetTech
Dear Evoldir Colleagues-
Please pass on this message to any students and/or col-
leagues who might be interested in the position.
I am seeking to hire a full-time permanent lab-
oratory technician to conduct research in the ar-
eas of quantitative and molecular genetics of shell-
ﬁsh, especially oysters. The position is with the
USDA Agricultural Research Service as part of
a program for the selective breeding of cultured
shellﬁsh ( http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/-
projects.htm?ACCN NO@5577&fy 02) . The posi-
tion is located in Newport, OR at Oregon State
University’s Hatﬁeld Marine Science Center ( http://-
hmsc.oregonstate.edu/ ). The laboratory is designed
for high-throughput genotyping of microsatellite and
single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including automated
DNA sequencing and liquid handling, and research will
focus on using these methods for QTL mapping and
gene expression analyses of loci contributing to life his-
tory traits , stress and disease resistance, economically
important characters such as shelf-life and meat qual-
ity, and morphological characters such as shell shape
and coloration patterns. Recently, a larger number of
mapped microsatellite loci have become available in the
Paciﬁc Oyster, Crassostrea gigas, that will greatly fa-
cilitate this work, and SNP markers are in development
in other laboratories. In addition the main campus in
Corvallis has the technology for microarray analysis,
and there is a growing amount of sequence data avail-
able will greatly facilitate the development of DNA chip
technology in the near future.
The ideal candidate would have a Master’s degree, but
practical experience in a working lab would be con-
sidered equivalent if it provided familiarity with the
necessary molecular techniques (DNA/RNA isolation,
PCR, electrophoresis, molecular cloning, DNA sequenc-
ing etc.). Familiarity with the bioinformatic and statis-
tical approaches used to analyze molecular genetic dataare also highly desirable , but training can be provided.
There will be some ﬁeld work required for animal rear-
ing and data collection. I am looking for more of a
high-level laboratory manager who will contribute to
the intellectual aspects of the work rather than sim-
ply a pair of hands at the bench. There will be ample
scope for independent projects, presentation of results
at meetings and in publications, and participation in
formulating research agendas. The advertised salary
range is large, so there is ample scope for advancement
for more junior applicants, and more senior applicants
will be given full consideration.
Newport is a small, oceanfront city with unspoiled
beaches, an active ﬁshing ﬂeet, and numerous tourist
attractions located at the mouth of the Yaquina Bay
on the central Oregon coast. The cost of living is very
reasonable, especially compared to other west coast ar-
eas. Portland is about 2.5 hours north, and Corvallis is
about 1 hour east.
Please email or call me with any questions, but be sure
to apply according to the instructions in the oﬃcial an-
nouncement below, including a cover letter that specif-
ically addresses the required skills. The federal govern-
ment can be very exacting when it comes to these de-
tails, and applications are ﬁltered by human resources
staﬀ before being forwarded to scientists.

AMOVA intraindividual
Hi there!
I’m coming across some trouble with the analysis of
my data and would appreciate some ideas on how to
proceed:
We are working with ITS sequences for phylogeographic
studies and for some individuals (20%) we have found
intraindividual variation. After clonning them, the
amount of variants found within each of these individ-
uals has been pretty diﬀerent, ranging from 2 to 7. So
for all the individuals analyzed the majority have only
one allele, but within these 20%— >2,3,4 or 7 diﬀerent
alleles have been found.
In order to compare how the extent of intraindividual
variation relates to interindividual variation we have
think of an AMOVA. Arlequin seems the good pro-grame to use but my doubt is that although this pro-
gram seems to work with genotypic data, I’m afraid
that for genotypic data they assume biallelic data....and
for this mulpicopy marker that shows a higher number
of alleles per individual I don’t know how to organize
the ﬁle.
has anybody dealt with this problem before?
I will appreciate any idea!
Thanks a lot!

AMOVA intraindividual answers
Dear all,
First of all I would like to thank all the people that
have given me ideas and opinions about interindividual
vs. intraindividual AMOVA with multi-copy markers
as ITS. As many people asked me to send them the
answers, I’ve decided to post them in the list.
To summarize, although the best option could be to
treat each individual as a population, that is, treating
each allele within an individual as an haplotype within
a population, even if we could know how many copies
of the ITS are present in the genome of the organism
studied, it would probably be very diﬃcult to know
how many copies are present for each of the diﬀerent
variants. Thus, as the frequency of each distinct allele
within each individual is unknown, it is kind of tricky to
compare inter and intraindividual variation with multi-
copy markers with the AMOVA.

HERE ARE THE ANSWERS
——————————————
You may want to back up a bit an do the AMOVA
with the original AMOVA 1.5 program. In addition to
not having a cryptic ﬁle format, it works on the dis-
tance matrix directly. You would have to come up with
an appropriate distance metric (see Excoﬃer & Smouse
paper on Molecular Variance Parsimony for a methodappropriate to sequence stuﬀ). In fact, you could just
do it ’by hand’ if your so inclined once you deﬁne the
distance metric.
——————————————-
from your message it is a bit diﬃcult to give advise
because you did not tell wich which species you are
working. Are they diploid? Could some of them be
hybrids (including ancient hybrids)? Did you check for
PCR chimaeras? (The problem was described in detail
by Cronn, R., Cedroni, M., Haselkorn, T., Grover, C.,
Wendel, J.F. (2002) PCR-mediated recombination in
ampliﬁcation products derived from polyploid cotton.
Theor. Appl. Genet. 104: 482-489, not for ITS, but
with ITS the problem might be worse because of the
high copy numbers.) What is the approximate evolu-
tionary age of your species? Concerted evolution might
not yet have homogenized the ITS copies. Also, there
are papers that e.g. in hybrids can occur asymmetric
elimination of speciﬁc ITS types and so on. The same
might happen at intraindividual level to make it unpre-
dictable how many variants survive of will be found in
your samples. Can you exclude contaminations? So,
the whole ﬁeld is rather complex. Maybe it helps to
browse the literature (not necessarily the phylogeogra-
phy literature only) for the tricks and pitfalls of the
ITS. Maybe that can give you an idea what might be
possibly going on with your data set.
———————————————-
Two immediate reactions are that individuals with
’clean’ sequence traces would probably show intraindi-
vidual variation if you cloned (this was our experience)
and that AMOVA should work if you treat each indi-
vidual as a haploid population (eg by pretending that
the sequences are mitochondrial).
———————————————-
While I have not dealt speciﬁcally with the analysis of
data such as yours, I have had some experience with ITS
paralogy in plants, where it has been well documented.
I do not know what methodology you are using to clone
the ITS paralogs, but if it involves PCR from genomic
DNA, I would urge you to use caution in proceeding
with your analysis. This is because the number of al-
leles you isolate from any individual may not represent
the actual number in the genome. My experience (in
plants only) suggests that you might get just one al-
lele from one ampliﬁcation, but get several alleles from
a second ampliﬁcation of the same template. The pa-
per cited below (which you may already be aware of)
suggests some possible reasons for this, in light of the
competitive nature of PCR. If stochastic ampliﬁcation
of paralogs is occuring in your samples, I think that the
results of the AMOVA you

Allozymes angiosperms
Hello-
Does anyone have experience doing allozyme work on
cellulose acetate in angiosperms? I’m using a lithium-

every individual I screen appears monomorphic. I’ve
even started genotyping various species I know to be
highly variable, and no heterozygotes. The bands aren’t
very ﬁne, so I’m beginning to wonder if the grinding and
running buﬀers I’m using just aren’t giving me the res-
olution I need. If you have any suggestions I’d really
appreciate it.

aramakris@yahoo.comCollaboration hostparasites
Plea for Collaboration-
Hello, my name is Jessica Light and I am a Ph.D stu-
dent at Louisiana State University working on a molec-
ular analysis of host-parasite cophylogeny. My research
concentrates on the sucking lice of rodents, with a fo-
cus on heteromyids and their lice. While I have col-
lected lice from a majority of the North American het-
eromyids, I am looking to form collaborations to collect
Central and South American heteromyids and their lice.
The collaboration I propose will actually save you time
in the ﬁeld. You simply measure, weigh, tissue, and
skin the animal, then freeze the skin in a foil pouch in
liquid nitrogen or dry ice. After I examine the skins
for ectoparasites, I will prepare the specimen for you as
a study skin or skeleton, whichever you prefer. Also,
I will wash the skin, so any blood and dirt will be re-
moved. This method has worked for well for hundreds
of specimens I have collected.
I have a detailed protocol explaining how my method
works and can pass that on to anyone who might be
interested.
While my interests do lie with the heteromyids, I will
gladly examine other rodent specimens for lice and
other ectoparasites.
Please contact me at jlight2@lsu.edu if you are inter-
ested.

Daphnia Evolution
DAPHNIA EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS AND GE-
NOMICS
We wish to call attention to two signiﬁcant develop-
ments in the ﬁeld of Daphnia genetics and genomics
that we hope will be of interest to students, postdocs,
and other established scientists.
In brief, with more details given below:
1) The Joint Genome Institute will be sequencing the
entire nuclear genome of Daphnia pulex within the next
few months. This information, along with numerous
other genomic tools under development, should rapidly
transform D. pulex into a premier system for a wide ar-
ray of studies in ecological and evolutionary genomics.
2) A multidisciplinary group of investigators has re-
cently been awarded a substantial grant from the NSF
FIBR program to use Daphnia to study The Causes
and Consequences of Recombination.
3) The Second Annual Daphnia Genomics Consortium
(DGC) meeting will be held in Manchester, NH on 8-9
September.
Daphnia Genomic Resources
In addition to the soon-to-be-complete genome se-
quence of D. pulex, a broad spectrum of other ge-
nomic tools are being developed by DGC members,
most of which should be fully available within the next
12 months. These include: 1) arrayed, ﬁngerprinted,
and end-sequenced 10-fold redundant BAC libraries for
both D. pulex and D. magna; 2) an arrayed 8-fold re-
dundant cosmid library; 3) high-density genetic map
based on ~1000 microsatellite markers; 4) collection of
~50,000 sequenced cDNAs; and 5) microarrays based on
these cDNAs. DGC members are also currently devel-
oping methods for genetic transformation, cell culture,
and RNAi. This rich genomic tool box, along with the
unusual life-history features of Daphnia (the ability to
clone, outcross, or self) and the ability to resurrect an-
cient genotypes (up to 1000-year old) by hatching eggs
from lake sediments, should rapidly transform D. pulex
into one of the most powerful systems for both labora-

This project draws together an interdisciplinary team of
researchers, further embedded in a broader consortium,
with a uniﬁed goal of understanding one of biology’s
deepest mysteries –the evolutionary causes and conse-
quences of recombination. The investigative team con-
sists of cell biologists, ecologists, parasitologists, quan-
titative geneticists, genomicists, and mathematicians,
all with considerable experience with speciﬁc aspects of
recombination. The study organism, the planktonic mi-
crocrustacean Daphnia pulex, provides an exceptional
array of opportunities for research in this area that is
unavailable with any other system: a wide range of
recombination intensities among natural populations,
the presence of multiple sexual and asexual lineages, a
powerful set of genomic tools, well understood ecology,
ease of experimental manipulation, and a living-fossil
record.
Project goals include: 1) development of high resolution
genetic and physical maps to provide a key resource for
the remainder of the project; 2) molecular and cytolog-
ical characterization of the mechanisms underlying the
transition from meiotic to mitotic progeny production;
3) evaluation of whether the mutation rate (includingSeptember 1, 2003 EvolDir 23
the activity of mobile-genetic elements) is aﬀected by
an absence of meiosis; 4) study of the fates of nonseg-
regating alleles locked into asexual lineages, and a test

Drawing networks answers
Hi there,
I recently ( 11th July) posted a question on the EvolDir
relating to the use of the program Network 3.0. I was
trying to determine a way of manipulating the network
obtained when using the software.
Thanks to everyone who replied to this the
ideas/solutions were very much appreciated. I also re-
ceived a number of e-mails from people indicating that
they were having similar problems, so I hope that the
responses here may help. I have included a number of
the suggestions I received. Several people had similar
type ideas so I have tried to omit those that were similar
in nature.
Generally there were three main approaches to solving
the problem.
1. Use some sort of graphics converter to convert the
bmp ﬁle to a ﬁle that can be manipulated (A few ways
of doing this see below).
2. Brute force if the network is relatively simple you
can cut and paste into something like CorelDraw and
then, using the various drawing tools, copy the image
by drawing over it and then deleting the original bmp
image. I did try this and for a simple network you can
very quickly recreate it. You can then manipulate the
colour, size etc. For a simple network this is probably
the way to go.
3. Other people suggested using other programs such as
TCS or MINSPNET. I have used TCS and the network
obtained from that is easily manipulated in CorelDraw
etc.
For those that asked, the program I was using was
Network 3.1.1.1 and it can be downloaded by going to
www.ﬂuxus-engineering.com Thanks again to everyone
who replied to the original question. As I have said Ireceived a large number of replies and I have tried to
include the major ideas in terms of solutions in the re-
ponses I have included below. All the reponses however,
were greatly appreciated good luck!

THE QUESTION (posted July 11, 2003)
We are currently using Network 3.0 to construct me-
dian joining networks from mitochondrial data. We are
trying to work out a way to manipulate the outputted
network (i.e. show the various populations represented
for a single haplotype by using diﬀerent colours for that
circle in the network). It appears that the network can
only be saved as a bmp ﬁle although it looks like emf
may be an option in the future.
Does anyone have any bright ideas that would allow fur-
ther manipulation of these images? What we would like
to do is export the image to something like CoralDraw
and be able to do further editing there.
Thanks for your help.
Andy Given
THE RESPONSES:
1. I just paste / import the bmp into CorelDraw to use
as a guide for the ﬁnal network that I then draw on a
layer above, since as far as I know there is currently no
other way to get a publication-quality ﬁgure. Obviously
this can be time-consuming, so an emf or postscript out-
put would be ideal. However, there doesn’t appear to
be much current development progress - many options
appear to have been ’under development’ for some time.
2. No doubt a thousand people will tell you about
Graphic Converter, a shareware mac product that can
be tried free and which is omni-capable fo ﬁle inter-
changes and totally reliable. Available from many sites
i think. I have tried Version 4.b
3. I just saw you posting on EvolDir. I have used the
Network program quite a few times and I have always
ended up redrawing the network by hand. I think there
really is no choice if you want to add say, pie charts in
place of the nodes in order to display the population
distribution of your haplotypes (corrected for diﬀering
population sample sizes...). I have a slightly acrimo-
nious relationship with Corel draw (!) and I ﬁnd the
best way to do this is in Excel. Here you can easily
do any data manipulations and create all your pie dia-
grams. The drawing tools are OK and you can use the
grid as a background to layout your network. I just size
the pie diagrams according to the grid based on appro-
priate frequency bins. You can draw it big and then
copy and past it into Powerpoint to shrink it an appro-
priate size for publication. It is really a pain but unless24 EvolDir September 1, 2003
the network is really huge and complicated then I ﬁnd
this to be the simplest option. That’s my suggestion -
if you hear of a better way please let me know!
4. The way I work with the output from a variety of
software is to create a pdf ﬁle. The problem with this
method is that you need to be using Adobe Acrobat
and Illustrator. When you Acrobat installed, you can
always set your printer to Adobe Distiller instead of
your actual line printer. When you set Distiller as the
printer, your program will ask you for a ﬁle name and
all output is saved as a pdf ﬁle. You have to be care-
ful that the output would go to a single page. What
this does is creates a vector graphic that you can then
import into Adobe Illustrator and do all the manipu-
lations that you want. I have learned to write ﬁles in
Adobe

Galerucella samples
Dear evoldir members
we are working on a project investigating speciation
in the Galerucella complex. These are beetles from the
Chrysomelid family occurring on a range of host plants.
Our focus is on Galerucella nymphaeae, the waterlily
leaf beetle, which feeds on waterlilies (Nymphaeae alba,
Nuphar lutea) and on Polygonaceae species (Rumex
hydrolapathum, Polygonum amphibium) as well as a
number of other species. For a large phylogeographic
study we are searching for samples to complement our
own range of samples. We are looking for samples from
all over Europe, but are also interested in samples from
North-America and Asia. For reference we would also
be very grateful for samples from related species (G.
pussila, G. calmariensis occurring on purple loose strife;
and any other G. species). We would be very happy
with any help here. It is not much work, once you are
in a pond or river sampling the beetles is just 15-30
minutes work. For any details on how to sample and
how to preserve the beetles please contact

Indel vs substitution
Can anyone out there help me with a citation that an-
swers the following:
Do homologous protein coding gene sequences tend to
diverge faster in sequence identity (i.e. nucleotide sub-
stitutions) than they do in length?
My suspicion is ’yes’, but ideally I’d like to ﬁnd a *very*
general quantitative corroboration of this (i.e. pooledSeptember 1, 2003 EvolDir 25
across many protein families, across major phyletic lin-
eages) - a short, robust answer one way or the other.
I feel that it’s so obvious a question that someone must
have asked it, probably very early on (sorry if it’s some-
thing I really ought to know!), but maybe it’s so obvious
or so daft a question that noone has?

Phylogeography question
I am working on the phylogeography of a common but-
terﬂy (Hesperia comma), and I have a question about
using programs like ARLEQUIN (or GEODIS or TCS)
to analyze nuclear sequences that are polymorphic at a
number of locations. Should I take every sequence and
break it into two forms (for the diﬀerent alleles), or can
I enter the sequences with the polymorphic codes (Y,
R, etc)? It seems like the former would be a nice op-
tion, because I could then make a minimum spanning
network to visualize the alleles–but is that a kind of
pseudo-replication to get two sequences out of one indi-
vidual? People clearly use these programs with nuclear
data in publications, but I have not been able to ﬁnd
one where the methods are stated explicitly. Thanks.

Phylogeography question answers
A number of people asked that I provide a summary
of the replies from my question. Brieﬂy, this is what I
asked: what should I do to generate haplotypes from
nuclear sequences with a number of polymorphic sites
(so that I can use programs like TCS and ARELQUIN)?
It seems that it’s a pretty messy business trying to in-
fer such haplotypes (without actually doing more lab
work). However, one program was recommended by a
number of people, and that’s PHASE. A reference for
that is:

Statistical Method for Haplotype Reconstruction from

Software TRACER v1 0
Tracer v1.0
This is a graphical program for analysing the output
of Bayesian MCMC software including our program
BEAST and the popular MrBayes.
BEAST - <http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/ >Mr-
Bayes - <http://morphbank.ebc.uu.se/mrbayes/ >It
can plot the traces, estimate autocorrelation, plot pos-
terior densities and give conﬁdence intervals. It can
also compare and combine output from multiple runs.
It can be used to look for convergence, select burn-ins
and check for adequate chain length. For each parame-
ter it can estimate the Eﬀective Sample Size (ESS) - the
number of eﬀectively independent draws from the pos-
terior distribution that the Markov chain is equivalent
to.
It can produce publication quality output either as SVG
graphics or by Printing to PDF if available (i.e., Mac
OS X).
Note that this program analyses the continuous param-
eters of the models (i.e., not the trees) - for MrBayes
this means the ’.p’ ﬁles and for BEAST the ’.log’ ﬁles.

TagIT softwareTagIT software for tagging SNP selection and analysis
The latest version of this software (ver 1.17) is avail-
able for download (free for non-commercial use) from
http://popgen.biol.ucl.ac.uk/software.html
TagIT is a set of functions to facilitate analysis of linked
SNP genotypic data in order to identify a small set
of ’tagging’ SNPs (also known as ’haplotype tagging’
SNPs) which can be used in future association studies
to look for unknown causal SNPs within the region.
Brieﬂy, TagIT functions perform the following:
1) Input and cropping of linked genotypic data
- either of unrelated individuals or of trios
(mother+father+child).
2) Check for Mendelian inconsistencies in trios (i.e. in-
compatible child’s genotype given parents’ genotypes).
3) Tests for HW equilibrium at each locus.
4) In trio data, return all completely resolved haplo-
types (i.e. complete parental haplotypes with resolved
phase).
5) Combine resolved haplotypes with unresolved data
in an EM algorithm to estimate haplotype frequencies
in trio data (algorithm also works on unrelated data is
necessary). To our knowledge, this is the only such EM
algorithm available for trio data.
6) Calculate pairwise LD measures and P-values using
haplotype frequency data.
7) Display LD measures using grid plots.
8) Provide “best” tSNP sets of various sizes, according
to one of a number of diﬀerent criteria, including r-
squared based criteria appropriate for association stud-
ies.
9) Assess the ability of “best” tSNP sets to associate
with loci that have been dropped from the set used to
derive the tSNP, to help assess an optimal tSNP set
size designed to look for an unknown causal SNP in a
future association study.
A comprehensive user guide is available. The TagIT
software can be seen “in action” in the following forth-
coming publications:

THE ANSWERS: —————————- my experience
is not with birds but with a large group of closely re-
lated butterﬂies of which I have sequenced for mtDNA
(COI) and nuclear DNA (ITS-2).
I do not think that nuclear pseudogenes (is that what
you mean?) are a major problem if you work with stan-
dard primers, but I think that mtDNA analysis is not
the appropriate method for your question.
Firstly, mtDNA gene trees often do not correspond to
species trees in closely related species. (Therefore we
have also included nuclear DNA.)
Secondly, although sometimes hidden species can be
revealed through mtDNA analysis, there is NO rec-
ognized distance for species/subspecies divergence for
good reason. From my experiences genetic distances
between species can vary greatly. On the one hand we
had well diﬀerentiated species in our analysis (which
are diﬀerent in phenotype, in karyotype and even occur
sympatrically) which did not diﬀer genetically in the
markers used. On the other hand, some populations
which are considered as belonging to the same species
(and which do not diﬀer in phenotype) can be geneti-
cally quite diﬀerent. The problem is that mtDNA anal-ysis cannot prove if gene ﬂow persists or not, because
you only have haplotypes. Microsatellite analysis would
seem to be the more appropriate method for your ques-
tion and even the good old allozymes seem preferable
to mtDNA analysis.

i am not a bird person but what i can tell you is that
you do not need to isolate mtDNA from the genomic
DNA. if you just extract total DNA as you would do
for microsats you can then use PCR to amplify speciﬁc
regions of mtDNA. there’s plenty of universal primers
that have been published for vertebrates and i assume
more speciﬁcally for birds.

Sounds like mtDNA will be a good component for this

Yes, absolutely! This problem most often occurs with
avian blood samples but can crop up from any tissue.
If one works with feathers or
muscle tissue, nuclear copies of mtDNA are usually not
a problem. Assuming that the parrots will be captured
and released, I strongly recommend collecting feather
samples (in addition to blood which may come in handy
for future work on nuclear DNA). The feathers should
be plucked, not cut, as the case of the quill (or calamus)
if the part used for DNA extraction. From a parrot, one
could pluck an inner secondary or a tail feather or even
a couple of contour feathers from

Post-Doc position - Theoretical Biology, Leiden Uni-
versity (The Netherlands)
’Dimensions of Speciation’
We are looking for a Post-Doc to delve into certain
aspects of models for the origin of new species. The
simpliﬁed genetics in speciation models is often geared
towards obtaining new species. In the allopatric case
this is done by assuming certain relationships between
ﬁtnesses and genotypes. In the sympatric case this is
done by only allowing the population to branch into
two distinct phenotype classes through the development
of assortative mating. In the allopatric case one can
ask how an appropriate holey ﬁtness landscape may
develop through the interplay of a genotype to phe-
notype map and a population dynamics determining
the density and frequency dependent ﬁtnesses. In the
sympatric case one can ask what happens when alter-
native mechanisms allowing for a phenotypic branching
are present, like the availability of some developmental
switch (e.g. based on an environmental cue, or on the
presence or absence of a certain allele on a given major
trait locus, or gender for that matter), with adaptive
modiﬁcation of the phenotypic eﬀect of the switch. In
particular one may ask the question what happens if
diﬀerent mechanisms are raced against each other.
In both cases the overall question is how the odds for
certain outcomes depend on overall properties of the
genetic architecture. The project should make a start
with assessing the dependence of the odds for specia-
tion on genetic and ecological degrees of freedom. The
short term goal of the project is twofold: (1) Investigate
the robustness of conclusions from existing speciation
models by varying certain genetic and ecological dimen-
sions. (2) Attempt to use the theory developed under
(1) to analyse options for speciation in a model of a ﬁeld
system. This system should be often polymorphic, and
in some cases this polymorphism should have resulted
in the formation of separate species. A system of this
type is found, for example, in butterﬂy mimicry rings.
The Leiden Theoretical Biology group oﬀers a widerange of expertises. We i.a. specialise in adaptive dy-
namics, but other group members work on topics as
diverse as RNA folding and phylogeny reconstruction.
The work will be done in close collaboration with the
Leiden Animal Ecology group. Between them the two
groups oﬀer the relevant experience and facilities.
Proﬁle: PhD in Biology, Physics, Mathematics or Com-
puter Science, preferentially with a specialization in
Theoretical Biology. The appointment is for a max-
imum of two years. The gross monthly salary is be-
tween 2.136.= and 3.352,= euro, depending on prior
experience. Salary and fringe beneﬁts are conform the

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION University of Notre

POPULATION GENETICS OF SPECIES’ RANGE
BOUNDARIES A postdoctoral research position is
available in the Hellmann Lab (Department of Biolog-
ical Sciences, University of Notre Dame) to study the
genetics of populations at their northern range limit. I
am looking for someone well-versed in molecular tech-
niques who is interested in bringing genetic studies to
bear on issues of global change and applied ecology.
The position is to join a multi-faceted research project
examining both the ecological and evolutionary impacts
of climate change on the distributional limits of two
model butterﬂies species. This research grows out of
previous studies by Dr. Hellmann on the impacts of cli-
mate change in grassland ecosystems (for example, see:
Hellmann, J. 2002. J An Ecol 70:925-936; McLaugh-
lin, J., Hellmann, J., Boggs, C., and P. Ehrlich. 2002.
PNAS 99:6070-6074). Our current research examines
the hypothesis that diﬀerences in life history traits lead
to distinct patterns of gene ﬂow across a species’ range
and that taxa with contrasting genetic structures will
respond diﬀerently to climatic warming. Mechanistic
studies of species’ range shifts are an emerging area
of global change biology that is highly policy-relevant.
This position oﬀers an opportunity for a geneticist to
join ecologists in tackling this novel area of applied re-
search.
The successful candidate must demonstrate an intel-
lectual commitment to research in applied biology and
is expected to pursue both independent research and
molecular assessments of gene ﬂow. Marker develop-
ment for this project will build on systematic and evolu-
tionary work pursued by other lepidopteran researchers.
Exactly which markers and techniques will be used will
depend on the mutual interests of the successful can-
didate and the PI. The position has guaranteed fund-
ing for two years. Resources available in the pursuit of
this research include a strong molecular genetics faculty
within the biology department at Notre Dame.
This position is open until ﬁlled. Salary is commensu-
rate with experience. Applicants should send a brief
letter describing their prior research experience and
current interests, a curriculum vitae, and the names
and contact information of three references to: JessicaSeptember 1, 2003 EvolDir 37

An NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available in the
Burke lab at Vanderbilt University. The goal of this
project is to identify and characterize genes that were
under selection during the domestication of sunﬂower.
This work will combine genotypic and sequence-based
approaches to identify genes bearing the population ge-
netic signature of selection. The functionality of such
genes will then be investigated by genetically mapping
them and comparing their genomic locations to those
of QTLs underlying domestication traits, as well asthrough analyses of gene expression. Background in-
formation can be found in:

This research provides an ideal opportunity for appli-
cants interested in the molecular basis of phenotypic
evolution. Funding is available for up to ﬁve (5) years
and, although the position is available immediately, the
start data is ﬂexible. Candidates should have a strong
background in population genetics with experience ap-
plying molecular tools to evolutionary questions.

University. The project involves relating sequence vari-
ation to variation in gene expression and to pheno-
typic variation found among natural isolates of Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae. Expression diﬀerences have already
been associated with phenotypic diﬀerences. The seg-
regation of these expression diﬀerences with markers
and phenotypes will be used to understand the con-
tribution of gene expression to complex traits. Yeast
genome technologies will be used to rapidly map quan-
titative characters. Applicants should have a strong
background in either molecular biology, evolutionary
biology or computational biology.
The salary is 45K and funds are available for three
years. Applicants should send a CV and the

UHawaii EvolComp
On-line course oﬀering: ICS 691: Evolutionary Compu-
tation (Topics in Software), Department of Information
and Computer Sciences, University of Hawaii at Manoa.
There are a number of seats available through the Out-
reach College at the University of Hawaii at Manoa for
the on-line graduate level course in evolutionary compu-
tation that I am oﬀering for this semester. This course
will be an introduction to the ﬁeld of evolutionary com-
putation (genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evo-
lutionary programming, genetic programming, artiﬁcial
life), geared to getting the student involved in research
in the ﬁeld as quickly as possible. Course work will con-sist of a research project, class discussions, and readings
from the texts:
Evolutionary Computation 1: Basic Algorithms and
Operators , ed. T. Back, D. B. Fogel and T.
Michalewicz, Institute of Physics Publishing, Bristol
and Philadelphia. ISBN 0-7503-0664-5. 2000.
Evolutionary Computation 2: Advanced Algorithms
and Operators , ed. T. Back, D. B. Fogel and T.
Michalewicz, Institute of Physics Publishing, Bristol
and Philadelphia. ISBN 0-7503-0665-3. 2000.
Research projects can be on applications, theory, his-
tory, or empirical studies of evolutionary algorithms.
The goal is that the student’s project be published in
one of the many proceedings or journals on evolutionary
computation. The course is entirely Web-based, using
the Blackboard system, and asynchronous, except for
deadlines on submissions.
This fall’s introductory course will be followed in the
Spring 2004 semester by an in-depth course on Genetic
Programming, which is the application of evolutionary
approaches to the engineering of executable programs.
Registration information is available at
http://www.outreach.hawaii.edu/registration/-

at my Web site,
http://dynamics.org/Altenberg/UH ICS/ The course
begins August 25, but registration is still possible after
that date.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject42 EvolDir September 1, 2003
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
