Herewith we would like to remind you on the *dead-
line for submission of talks/posters and the deadline
for reduced fee registration (31.3.2006)* for the
*19^th Annual Meeting of the Plant Population Biol-
ogy Meeting of the Ecological Society of **Germany**,
**Switzerland** and **Austria** (GfOe),*
taking place in Halle, Germany, from 24 May to 27 May
2006 organized jointly by the UFZ-Centre for Environ-
mental Research and the Geobotanical Institute of the
University of Halle.
The annual meeting is being held in English and usu-
ally attended by more than one hundred people from
all over Europe. Priority is given to young researchers
to present results from their PhD theses. The focus
of the meeting in 2006 is on interactions of plants with4 EvolDir April 1, 2006
other species, recognizing that plants have to cope with
a large number of competitors, herbivores, pathogens
and symbionts. Therefore, to understand the popula-
tion biology of plants, botanist would have to broaden
their scope and incorporate these interactors in their
studies. Presentations from the whole ﬁeld of plant
population biology are welcome.
Keynote speakers include: - *Claire de Mazancourt*,
Imperial College at Silwood Park - *Jacqui Shykoﬀ*,

THEME AND SCOPE: Large-scale genome sequenc-
ing projects are generating vast amounts of data for a
multitude of organisms including mammals and other
vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants, bacteria, and
viruses. As the data increase so do the opportunities
and the challenges for scientists to interpret them. By
endeavouring to make sense of the process and pattern
of genome evolution, comparative genomics lies at the
forefront of this challenge. The core of comparative
genome analysis is the establishment of the correspon-
dence between genes (orthology analysis) or other ge-
nomic features in diﬀerent organisms. It is these in-
tergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the
evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence
of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events
acting at various organizational levels shape genome
evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations aﬀect
individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromo-
somal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer,
inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ulti-
mately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hy-
bridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often
leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome
evolution poses many exciting challenges to develop-
ers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have
recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and
mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuris-
tic, ﬁxed parameter and approximation algorithms for
problems based on parsimony models to Monte Carlo
Markov Chain algorithms for Bayesian analysis of prob-
lems based on probabilistic models. The RECOMB
Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics is a fo-
rum on all aspects and components of this ﬁeld, ranging
from new quantitative discoveries about genome struc-
ture and process to theorems on the complexity of com-
putational problems inspired by genome comparison.

DIVERSITY AT SSE/SSB 2006:
Call for applications for undergraduates of diverse back-
grounds to attend the 2006 meeting of the Society for
the Study of Evolution/Society of Systematic Biologists
For the fourth consecutive year, the Undergraduate Di-
versity at SSE/SSB program, funded by the Under-
graduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB)
program at NSF, will take place again at the 2006 meet-
ing this June in Stony Brook, New York and we are nowaccepting applications. The program will send 15 un-
dergraduates from the US and Puerto Rico to attend
the SSE/SSB meetings to present posters and interact
with graduate student, postdoc and faculty mentors.
The application deadline is April 1, 2006. Applica-
tions will consist of a title, author line and abstract
of the poster to be presented by the undergraduate;
a one or two paragraph (no more than 1 page) state-
ment of academic interests and career goals and of how
attending the Evolution meetings will help meet these
goals; and one letter of recommendation from the un-
dergraduate’s research advisor. The letter should in-
dicate how inclusion of the student will increase di-
versity of the group participants and whether or not
the student will be attending medical school. All ma-
terials should be submitted as pdf ﬁles and emailed
to Rich Kliman at rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu. Appli-
cations will be accepted only from students registered
or very recently graduated from U.S. institutions, in-
cluding Puerto Rico (i.e., having ﬁnished classes during
the winter or spring semesters before the meeting) and
traveling to the meeting from within the US. Students
demonstrating a need for funds to attend SSE/SSB will
be given preference, and will be selected so that as a
group, they will increase cultural diversity among un-
dergraduates at Evolution meetings.

Life-history determinants of evolvability.
This project will involve the construction of individual-
based population models to explore the interaction be-
tween life-history characteristics (such as dispersal, age
at ﬁrst reproduction, pattern of senescence, mating sys-
tem) and evolutionary potential. The work will (1) seek
to establish how diﬀerent life-history characteristics in-
ﬂuence the ability of a population to adapt following an
environmental change and (2) will determine whether
the need for greater evolvability in a changing environ-
ment can itself drive the evolution of these life-history
characteristics. A suitable candidate would have a keen
interest in environmental change and evolutionary biol-
ogy and have programming skills in C, C++ or Pascal.
It is anticipated that the project will utilise high per-
formance computing (parallel processing). The student
will be supported by a BBSRC grant and will be based
at Aberdeen starting in October 2006. Please contact
Justin Travis for further details (jmjt@ceh.ac.uk).

ETHZurich InsectBehaviour
We are seeking a motivated and creative PhD Student
in Entomology with a Diploma degree in Biology or re-
lated University Degree. The PhD project will focus on
insect behaviour and its genetic basis.
To achieve successful biological control, ﬁtness of mass-
reared and released parasitoid wasps should be high.
Mechanisms leading to optimal or suboptimal sex ra-
tios (so-called single locus complementary sex determi-
nation) shall be investigated in a parasitoid of practical
relevance in vegetable farming, occurring naturally in
Switzerland. Desirable is a high proportion of (diploid)
females and a minimal proportion of diploid males.
Methods will include ﬁeld collection, establishment and
rearing of laboratory subpopulations, quantiﬁcation of
ﬁtness and mate choice behaviour, as well as elucidation
of genetic diversity using molecular tools (microsatellite
markers). Results are expected to be relevant for basic
understanding of sex allocation and mating structures
in parasitoids, as well as for application in biological
control.
Languages spoken in the group are mainly German and
English.
Education: Diploma degree (or MSc) in Biology or re-lated University Degree. Start: Position open until
ﬁlled.

tracing relevant genes in populations and to eventually
analyze the genetic dynamics of host-parasite interac-
tions in the ﬁeld. The ideal candidate has experience in
molecular genetics, genomics, the use of data banks and
bioinformatics, combined with a vivid interest in evolu-
tionary biology, population genetics and ecology. The
project will be embedded in an active research group
with long-term experience of the system.

LeidenU EvolBirdsong
Two PhD positions available
Closing date: 30 April 2006.
Behavioural Biology, Institute of Biology, Leiden Uni-
versity
BIRDSONG, SPEECH AND LANGUAGE Human
speech and birdsong share several striking similaritieswhich are such that learned birdsong is considered to be
the closest animal analogue to language and both lin-
guists and biologists have suggested that results from
one ﬁeld could yield hypotheses, or even answers to
questions, for the other. The following two projects,
for which we seek candidates, also aim to contribute to
this rapidly growing ﬁeld of comparative research.
1 - Bird song structure and language syntax: a com-
parative interdisciplinary approach.
One key feature distinguishing human language from
other animal vocal communication systems concerns
the presence of a rule based syntax underlying lin-
guistic utterances. But are humans really unique in
their abilities to detect and use syntactical rules, or do
they share some of these properties with other species?
This project will address this issue by analyzing the
syntactical abilities of a songbird, the zebra ﬁnch. It
will focus on two questions: 1) Are zebra ﬁnches ca-
pable of detecting and distinguishing between diﬀer-
ent types of (experimentally constructed) grammars?
2) What are the species speciﬁc grammar rules which
guide zebra ﬁnch song production and development?
The project will involve a bioacoustic analysis of song
structure in zebra ﬁnches, diﬀerent types of experi-
ments to analyze syntactical capabilities (e.g. habitua-
tion/dishabituation tasks, operant tasks involving dis-
crimination learning, etc.) and developmental studies
on the role of experience in structuring song syntax.
2 - Bird Speech? On the production and perception of
formants in bird vocalisations.
Human speech conveys language, and much research
eﬀort concerns the production and perception of acous-
tic features that encode linguistic meaning in speech.
An important feature are formants, which are time-
varying frequency bands that are emphasized in the
broad-band spectrum of speech. Formant patterns re-
sult from acoustic resonances of the vocal tract, the
characteristics of which are rapidly modulated using
articulators such as the tongue, lips, and soft palate.
Studies of birdsong have hardly addressed the role of
formants, although several ﬁndings indicate their pres-
ence. The proposed project aims to provide a com-
prehensive analysis of formant mechanisms in birds. It
will address the following questions: 1) To what ex-
tent do vocal tract resonances cause formant patterns
in natural bird vocalizations, and how do vocal tract
articulators modulate such patterns? 2) What are the
perceptual sensitivities of birds to formant patterns in
natural bird vocalizations? 3) Are formant patterns in
natural bird vocalizations aﬀected by vocal production
learning? The project will involve morphological, phys-
iological and bioacoustical analyses and experimentalApril 1, 2006 EvolDir 15
studies on the vocalization systems of zebra ﬁnches and
budgerigars, together with experiments on the percep-
tion of formant variants.
The projects are based in the research group Be-
havioural Biology. This is an active, internation-
ally oriented research group with a strong focus on
(vocal) communication in animals. The group cur-

The ecology and evolution of ﬂower colour
There is a wealth of published information on why ﬂow-
ers have the colours they do. Unfortunately, much of
this information is ﬂawed, since botanists rarely con-
sidered that ﬂowers are addressed to pollinators, whose
colour vision diﬀers fundamentally from that of hu-
mans. All insect pollinators see UV light, many see
the entire spectrum from UV to red, and some have
colour vision systems with 5 spectral receptor types
(rather than the 3 that humans have). Chittka’s lab-
oratory has, over the years, collected reﬂectance spec-
tra (including the UV) from over 2000 plants species
from Israel, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Nor-
way. The CASE collaborator, Vincent Savolainen at
Kew Gardens, has the world’s second most extensive
database for such spectra, with over 800 species from
tropical Africa, Australia and the Neotropics. Given
these databases, and the extensive knowledge on polli-
nator vision, fundamental questions in the ecology and
evolution of ﬂower colour can now be re-addressed. We
are seeking to employ a bioinformatics PhD student or
a biology PhD student (ideally, but not necessarily with
expertise in programming) to embark on two tasks: 1.
to construct an online, open access database for ﬂoral
reﬂectance, and 2. to use this database to explore the
following questions: is there ecological divergence be-tween ﬂower colours of plants that ﬂower sympatrically
(i.e. in the same habitat)? To ﬂower signals addressed
to pollinators with diﬀerent colour vision systems (e.g.
bees and ﬂies) diﬀer in their colouration? Does UV re-
ﬂectance diﬀer depending on the incidence of UV radia-
tion at diﬀerent Alpine altitudes and tropical latitudes?
Do ﬂower colours (as perceived by pollinators) diﬀer
in diﬀerent habitats, depending on illumination condi-
tions and predominant background materials? Does the
relatively recent increase of UV radiation in Australia
have an impact on the ﬂower colouration there, as medi-
ated by the selection imposed through bee pollinators?
These are some starting points, but the project would
obviously have many degrees of freedom for a student to
explore, and build the kind of scientiﬁc independence
that is necessary at the outset of a scientiﬁc career.
The student might also perform behavioural tests to
see how bees respond to ﬂower colours and patterns.
The project will undoubtedly result in several high im-
pact publications. The other major task would be to
merge the databases from Kew and Queen Mary, to
turn them into an openly accessible web based tool.
Chittka & Savolainen have already worked extensively
towards this goal, and have started to construct an SQL
database. This is now in advanced state, but will still
require ﬁne tuning before it can go online. In addi-
tion, we hope to 1) expand the user interface in such
a way that it can calculate the subjective appearance
of ﬂower colours for diﬀerent taxa of pollinators; 2) In-
corporate user authentication, to allow diﬀerent users
diﬀerent levels of access - e.g. some may be able to add
records to the database; a few might be able to add
records on behalf of others. 3) Establish web based ad-
ministration tools and backup protocols to allow the
database to be maintained by a non-SQL trained ad-
ministrator. The student would be trained in concepts
of modern ecology and evolutionary biology, with the
special perspective of the sensory ecology of pollinating
insects. It is hoped the student will bring along exper-
tise in database programming, but the bioinformatics
oﬃcer at Kew Gardens is ready to help if that should be
necessary. Field trips to locations in Africa and South
America would also be part of the project. The student
would be expected to spend at least part of the time at
Kew Gardens.

Cross-resistance or trade-oﬀs in immune system evolu-
tion?
The investment that is made into an immune system is
believed to be shaped by natural selection such that
the costs of immunity are balanced by the beneﬁts.
Invertebrate immune systems mostly lack speciﬁc ac-
quired immune responses, and are instead reliant onmore general defences. This raises the possibility that
investment in defences against one type of parasite may
also alter the host’s susceptibility to other parasites by
either decreasing the probability of infection, or alter-
natively by increasing it if the host trades- oﬀ one class
of defence against another. Such changes have the po-
tential to aﬀect the cost: beneﬁt balance of investment
in immune defences profoundly.
The objectives of this study are to assess the extent by
which resistance to particular species of parasite aﬀects
host susceptibility other parasites, and secondly to as-
sess how any observed changes in susceptibility arise
from modiﬁcations to the host’s immune investment.
Objective 1 will be achieved by an artiﬁcial selection
experiment, in the course of which lines of host insects
(Plodia interpunctella) resistant to three diﬀerent par-
asites, a virus, a fungal parasite and an ichneumonid
parasitoid wasp, will be created and then bioassayed
against the other two species of parasite. Objective 2
will be met by assaying a variety of aspects of the im-
mune system in each selection line. Relating these data
to the results from the bioassays will allow us to assess
how the selection line in question has responded to se-
lection, and how any patterns of changed susceptibility
to the other parasites have arisen.
Applications are invited from candidates with an in-
terest in insect immunology and evolutionary ecology
who have or expect to obtain an upper- second class or
better honours degree in biological sciences (or overseas
equivalent) in areas relevant to the project applied for.

function of aposematic defences.?
The project involves studies on invertebrate preda-
tor behaviour towards aposematic insect prey. Much
is known about the function of aposematic defences
against vertebrate predators (mainly birds), yet the
function of warning signals against invertebrates is rel-
atively unexplored. However, many aposematic insects
use visual warning signals also in their ﬁrst larval in-
stars, which are most likely too minute for being hunted
by birds or other vertebrates. As a basis for the project,
you will use the aposematic defence system of the bug
Lygaeus equestris (Heteroptera: Lygaeidae).
For more information, please contact main su-
pervisor Dr Gabriella Gamberale-Stille, e-mail

Preferred qualiﬁcations: MSc (or equivalent) in biol-
ogy with a ﬁnished graduate project (worth 18 weeks
of studies, or more, with a written report/thesis) with
an ethological, ecological or evolutionary focus. Ex-
perience from entomological and behavioural studies is
meriting, as is a general interest in evolutionary pro-
cesses. We are looking for a PhD student who is able
to take initiatives, interested in theory as much as em-
pirical work, and who has a good analytical capacity.
The PhD studies are planned to start 1 July 2006 (or as
agreed upon). For fulltime studies funding is given as a

The evolution of phenotypic polymorphism
A PhD position in theoretical evolutionary biology is
available at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm Uni-
versity, Sweden. Research topics for the position in-
clude the evolution of phenotypic polymorphism and
the evolution of individual variability, viewed from the
perspective of modern developmental biology.
Phenotypic polymorphism is a widespread phe-
nomenon, with examples like males and females in sex-
ual species, alternative male mating types and winged
and wingless individuals in certain insects. Variation
in so-called personality between individuals of social
species could also be regarded as phenotypic polymor-
phism. The basic issue concerns the evolution and de-
velopment of alternative phenotypes, in particular, the
evolution of developmental systems of phenotype de-
termination. Such systems can implement genetically
controlled polymorphisms and phenotypic plasticity, as
well as stochastic (randomizing or bet-hedging) poly-
morphisms.
The position can be either full-time over four years or
80% over ﬁve years (with a possibility of 20% teaching
assistantship), with a starting full-time yearly salary of
232800 SEK (around 24800 EUR). The starting date is
ﬂexible, but should be in the second half of 2006. Ap-
plicants should have a MSc (or equivalent background)
in a ﬁeld like evolution, ecology or population genetics,
or possibly physics and applied mathematics. Candi-
dates with a strong interest in evolutionary theory and
good conceptual, analytical and computer program-
ming skills are preferred. The position is open until
ﬁlled, but primary consideration will be given to ap-
plications received by 15 May 2006. To apply, send a
signed letter of application, containing a statement of
research interests and skills, addressed to the Head of
the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, SE-
106 91 Stockholm, Sweden. Attach your CV, copies
of degree certiﬁcates, copies of your masters thesis (or
equivalent thesis), any published or in-press papers,

UGuelph RibosomalDNA
I am looking for PhD candidates who are interested
in conducting research on the evolution of ribosomal
DNA. Interested students should contact Teresa Crease
at tcrease@uoguelph.ca. Additional information about
the Zoology graduate program at the University of
Guelph can be found at http://www.uoguelph.ca/ib/-
graduate zoology2.shtml . A description of my researchApril 1, 2006 EvolDir 21
interests is provided below.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is an important multigene
family that codes for the structural RNA molecules
that make up ribosomes. One unit of rDNA consists
of 3 genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA) separated
by intergenic spacers. The spacers contain sequences
that control the expression of the rRNA genes. Some
regions of these genes evolve very slowly while other re-
gions, known as expansion segments, and the intergenic
spacers evolve very rapidly. Despite this rapid evolution
in their sequence, they still maintain their function. In
addition, it has been observed that sequence similar-
ity among the members of this multigene family is high
within species relative to similarity between copies from
diﬀerent species. This phenomenon is known as “con-
certed evolution”.
Due to variation in the rate of evolution in diﬀerent
parts of the same repeat unit, rDNA is an excellent
model system with which to study the interaction be-
tween the molecular processes that cause concerted evo-
lution, and natural selection to maintain the structure
and function of the molecule. I use freshwater crus-
taceans in the genus Daphnia as a model organism
for this work as they contain unusually long expansion
segments, and show variation in breeding system with
some populations reproducing by cyclical and others by
obligate parthenogenesis.
The current goals of my research program are to:
1) test the hypothesis that rates of recombination and
rDNA copy number diﬀer between Daphnia species,
and thus cause diﬀerences in their rates of concerted
evolution
2) test the hypothesis that natural selection is acting on
rRNA gene expansion segment length variation within
species
3) identify proteins that bind to the ribosomal inter-
genic spacer, and determine the impact of intra- and
interspeciﬁc variation on the interaction between this
sequence and these proteins
4) determine the impact of breeding system and ge-
nomic location on the evolution of a Daphnia transpo-
son, Pokey, that is found both inside and outside of the
rDNA.

ric, and pollen viability studies. He/she will also adopt
a component of the study, or develop his/her own re-
lated project, to satisfy the research requirements of
the M.S. degree.
Partial Abstract Species in the early stages of diver-
siﬁcation serve as excellent models for studies of the
environmental conditions that drive speciation. The
highly variable Hawaiian tree, Metrosideros polymor-
pha (’Ohi’a), is such a species, having derived from
a progenitor that colonized the Hawaiian Islands from
New Zealand as recently as 0.5 to 1.0 million years ago.
Several of ’Ohi’a’s varieties co-occur across the volcanic
islands, which range in age from the environmentally
stable, 5-million-year-old Kauai to the still-forming and
highly heterogeneous Big Island. As such, ’Ohi’a pro-
vides an ideal system in which to examine the rela-
tionship between spatial and temporal environmental
heterogeneity and the evolution of reproductive isola-
tion, a precursor to speciation. This two-year study will
use hand-pollinations, microscopy, and growth cham-
bers to determine the relative cross-fertility within and
between varieties and the viability of the resulting
seedlings under a range of conditions. The proposed
work will help to illuminate the environmental condi-
tions under which speciation in outcrossed tree species
will occur.
Start date: Summer or Fall 2006
Desired Qualiﬁcations: Knowledge of basic botany,
strong interest in evolution, ability to work with and
mentor others, and strong analytical skills.
Students from under-represented groups are especially22 EvolDir April 1, 2006

ULiverpool SpermCompetition
PhD studentship available
Sperm competition and adaptive variation in mam-
malian ejaculates
Supervised by Dr Paula Stockley, University of Liver-
pool
Starting October 2006. Funded by The Leverhulme
Trust (UK/EU students)
Sperm competition occurs when the sperm of two or
more males compete to fertilize a female’s ova, and
is an extremely powerful selective force in the evolu-
tion of male reproductive traits. Our understanding
of how males attempt to maximise their reproductive
success under sperm competition owes much to the the-
oretical framework developed in the context of ’sperm
competition games’ - models designed to predict op-
timal investment in ejaculates. This project will pro-
vide critical empirical tests of sperm competition the-
ory, as a basis for understanding adaptive variation in
mammalian ejaculates. Using small mammal models
(bank voles, house mice), you will investigate the nature
of trade-oﬀs between ejaculate expenditure and other
male reproductive investment, and determine how theApril 1, 2006 EvolDir 23
number of sperm ejaculated varies in relation to local
sperm competition risk and intensity, as well as the
phenotypic traits of competing males and their mates.
The studentship will provide experience in evolutionary
and reproductive biology, including techniques of ex-
perimental design, statistical analysis and behavioural
observation.
You should have (or expect to receive) a First Class
Honours or an Upper Second Class Honours degree in
a relevant biological discipline, and a strong interest
in evolutionary biology. The successful applicant will
join the Mammalian Behaviour and Evolution groupbased at the University of Liverpool’s Veterinary Field
Station, on the Wirral Peninsula (see our website at:
http://www.liv.ac.uk/mbe/ ).
Apply by April 30th 2006, sending a covering letter and
CV with details of two academic referees, to Dr Paula
Stockley, Mammalian Behaviour & Evolution Group,
Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool,

opportunity for comparative genomics. The compara-
tive analysis will be focused on diﬀerential situations
such as the mode of reproduction, animal versus plant-
parasitic nematode species, and parasitic versus free-
living nematode species. Such comparative genomics
approaches will help elucidate the evolutive mecha-
nisms involved in the successful adaptation of M. incog-
nita to plant parasitism. Applicants are expected to
demonstrate the potential to establish an independent,
externally funded research program in his or her spe-
ciﬁc ﬁeld. The Department has excellent research facili-
ties. For more information, consult our website ( http:/-

SouthAfrica VolunteerFieldAssist
Please forward the following advertisement to all that
might be interested Volunteers as ﬁeld assistants and
one research station manager needed:
Field assistants needed for the project:
Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working inthe ﬁeld and with animals. Whereas the research is
mainly non-invasive, this is no job for extreme animal
right persons (we take tissue and blood samples).
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and
6 o‘ clock), and stops its activity with dusk. Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
ﬁeld will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
500 (around 75 Euro) must be paid for accommodation
at the research station. Students must buy their own
food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 1300 or 200
Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect to
pay about 300-400 Euros per month.
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
When and how long: From July 2006 onwards for a
minimum of 2 months.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to info@stripedmouse.com.

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics
(IBED) of the University of Amsterdam has a vacancy
for a
Plant evolutionary ecologist / assistant professor (UD)
The Experimental Plant Systematics group studies the
distribution and origin of genetic variation in various
plant genera, mostly relatives of the model species Ara-
bidopsis thaliana. One of the main research questions
is what role reproductive isolation and gene ﬂow play in
this process. The research questions are addressed by
a variety of experimental methods, for example molec-
ular analysis of genetic variation and gene expression,
analysis of breeding systems, studies of species hybrids
and introgression (also in a GMO context), and exper-
iments both in the ﬁeld and in the greenhouse. The
research of the appointee will focus on the evolution of
breeding systems and reproductive barriers in relation
to habitat fragmentation and adaptation. The work
will be carried out in close collaboration with the other
scientists (permanent staﬀ, postdocs, PhD students) in
the group. A thorough background in plant genetics,
ecology and ﬂoristics is required.

tems at all relevant levels, from genes to communities,
using a truly multidisciplinary approach. IBED is or-
ganized into three thematic clusters (evolution & bio-
diversity, geo-ecology and community dynamics) that
mainly study two related research topics, namely the
interaction and communication between organisms and
their environment, and the emergent dynamics at dif-
ferent spatial and temporal scales. Strategic research
concerns such topics as sustainable harvesting, the pre-
vention of toxic algal blooms, the conservation of en-

UManchester EvolBiol
Dear colleagues
I am pleased to announce a number of position open-
ings in the Faculty of Life Sciences at The University of
Manchester. In today’s issue of Nature, the Faculty has
advertised a total of 20 academic positions throughout
the life sciences, of which I am only highlighting those
that I think are most directly related to the readership
of this list. But I particularly encourage couples who
are looking for two jobs in the same place to have a
look at the whole list of jobs ( http://www.man.ac.uk/-
news/vacancies/academic.html#LS031 )
We are advertising these positions broadly. Our prior-
ity is to employ the best people rather than to target a
speciﬁc subject area.
Should you be interested in more than one of the po-34 EvolDir April 1, 2006
sitions, I think the safest thing to do is to submit a
separate application for each of them (I guess our of-
ﬁce staﬀ will be a bit overwhelmed with applications,
and may not be able to copy applications to all rele-
vant search committees). I deﬁnitely encourage such
multiple applications.
Further, more formal, information on individual posi-
tions is available from the university’s web site:
Lectureship in Evolutionary Biology http://-
www.man.ac.uk/news/vacancies/LS036.pdf Lec-
tureship in Evolutionary Developmental Biology
http://www.man.ac.uk/news/vacancies/LS037.pdf
Lectureship in Anatomy http://www.man.ac.uk/-
news/vacancies/LS033.pdf Other positions include
Gene Expression, Integrative Plant Biology among
others ( http://www.man.ac.uk/news/vacancies/-
academic.html#LS031 ).
Additional information:
Because the ad does not contain much speciﬁc informa-
tion about the institution and the positions, I will pro-
vide some information from my own perspective (this
is my own experience and the best information I have,
but it is not legally binding!).
The Faculty of Life Sciences is very large organization
(around 200 academic staﬀ) engaged in both research
and teaching. The University of Manchester has re-
sulted from the merger of the Victoria University of
Manchester and the UMIST, and the new university
has ambitious plans for growth and a substantial im-
provement of its research and teaching proﬁle. As part
of these plans, we anticipate that our Faculty should
grow by a further 50% over the next decade. This
size and the plans for growth make us a very dynamic
place – new ideas and research initiatives can be real-
ized quickly.
The Faculty is structured into research groups ( http:/-
/www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/ ), whose
aim is to facilitate research and collaboration (without
impeding collaboration across groups). Additional in-
formation on these groups is in the Further Particulars
for each of the positions.
The ad mentions single positions in each area, but it has
happened before that more than one than one person
was hired, although only one position was advertised
(when I applied, four candidates were interviewed for a
single position, and three of us were hired!).
A Lectureship is a junior academic position, compara-
ble to the rank of Assistant Professor in North America.
A diﬀerence is that tenure is much less of a problem
here. I have not yet heard of a person who was deniedpermanent employment after the probationary period
of 3-4 years. Promotion and permanent employment
are not linked here (the ranks are Lecturer – Senior
Lecturer – Reader – Professor).
Teaching loads here are comparable or lower than in
most universities in North America. An average teach-
ing load includes around 25 hours of lecturing per year,
some small-group teaching (tutorials for science stu-
dents or problem-based learning for medical/dental stu-
dents), supervision of student projects, and some mark-
ing of written work. Eﬀorts are made to coordinate the
teaching assignments with the research interests of staﬀ
members, but this does vary a bit from person to per-
son.
The Faculty puts major emphasis on excellence in re-
search. Research funding in the UK is competitive, but
as far as I know, it is about as good as it gets anywhere
these days. There is a range of funding agencies in-
cluding government research councils (NERC, BBSRC,
MRC) and charities (Wellcome Trust, Lister Institute
among others) including one charity that specializes if
funding projects that are hard to fund otherwise (Lever-
hulme Trust). Equipment grants can be obtained from
the Royal Society and other funding bodies (and equip-
ment can be included in normal grants). Research pro-
posals are shorter than in many other countries (up to

ABI3100-Pop4 Problems
Dear All: Here Im , back again with problems with ABI
3100 sequencer. There are three symptoms that lead us
to think that there might be a pop4 problem. Those
problems are: 1- red peaks (not real peaks, more like
noise peak) 2- high molecular weight standard peaks
falling down, notoriuosly. 3- high molecular weight mi-
crosatellites broadening 4- Elevated current (instead of
falling current, which is normal) These symptoms seem
to indicate that the cappilary array is stucked. It hap-
pens after processing only a few samples in diﬀerent
capillary arrays. But the thing is that we have changed
several times the array, the pop (same lote number),buﬀers, etc. and the only thing that seemed to make it
better is changing pop, but it is only for a few samples,
then the problem comes back. This problem is new.
We have been working with the same protocol, sample
types and materials for a long time and we never saw
this problem before. Does anyone have an idea? could
it be that the pop4 lote is all wrong? Any idea will be
of interest. Thanks!!!

ABI3100 standard ﬂat
Dear All: I have written you before asking for some
help with ABI3100 sequencer. Since a couple of
months, we,ve been seeing standard ﬂattening out
(higher molecular weight peaks) and red spike peaks in
data. Those problems seemed to be solved by changing
polymer lot. Even though red peaks dissapeared (untill
now at least), standard ﬂatenning out came back after a
few injections. Thats why we are very confussed about
the origin of this problem. Any suggestion? Thanks
again.

Scoring AFLP
Hi, Are you using the automatic scoring from Geno-
typer? My advice is don’t, you can not really trust the
machine to score your peaks only based on the peak
size. Are you deﬁning categories? If you deﬁne a cat-
egory by drawing the square on a peak and then ctl+l
(give it a name and select highest peak, exclusive, with
(scaled) height of at least ) for each band individually
you are more likely to extract the real data. It is like
giving standards for each band-size individually. You’ll
probably ﬁnd that each band-size has its own charac-
teristics and then you’ll be able to tell between noise
and a real peak. You may have to avoid overlapping
categories, since they are very noisy. You’ll ﬁnd that
some peaks need the (scaled) height of 1000 and oth-
ers of 90. It is kind of half-ways between hand-scoring
and the automatic method. Yes, it is time-consuming,
a good two weeks of scoring only, but is worthy. I have
also found that Nei’s distances are not appropriate for
AFLPs, they assume the same mutation rate across
loci. For a dendorgram try Reynolds, Weir and Cock-
erham’s 1983 as implemented in Phylip.That one does
not assume equal mutation rate. Hope this helps,

Hi Marianne,
I have spent a lot of time also thinking about the prob-
lem with calling AFLPs. I have been working with
Steve Keller at UVA, and I think an email he sent me
recently might be helpful.
Second, I’ve ﬁddled with this quite a bit, and thought
about it even more (sometimes to the point of keeping
me up at night!). As you say, it’s subjective. I don’t see
any way around that. However, my best solution has
been the following: First, make sure you assign each
individual sample a relative signal strength (Genotyper
has a way of doing this automatically), so you normal-
ize signal strength among your samples. Next, deﬁne
your loci across the entire sample using a very stringent
(i.e., high RFU threshold, say 200) criteria. The intent
here is that only “real” loci are going to get deﬁned.
This approach requires a high signal strength in only
one individual for a locus to get deﬁned. After I get my
loci deﬁnitions this way, I then score all the samples
with a less stringent RFU requirement (say 50). That
way, you’re scoring individuals for loci that you have
high conﬁdence are real and not artifactual, but you
are lenient on whether any given individual is present
for that locus.
I have started to use this technique and feel more con-ﬁdent when I’m seeing a peak vs. noise. I think that
20 is too low.
Hope this helps.
best, Amy
Hi Marianne, I don’t know what instrument you are
using to run your AFLP samples, but the ABI cap-
illary system we’ve been using (ABI 3100) only pro-
cesses peaks above 50. It’s suggested you do not score
low peaks as it’s close to instrument threshold. So if
I’m correct people usualy score peaks that are mostly
above 100. The problem with smaller peaks is not only
the risk that another small peak won’t be detected,
but also some small peaks can be just AFLP artefacts
–>hence 2 possibilities of introduction of noise into
your dataset. Using AFLP, you should have a plenty
of markers, so using less, but more correct ones should
only be an advantage. Another thing to look at is the
size of your bins (categories) in Genotyper. I think the
recommended size is around 1bp. So adopting rather
broader concepts of categories - as size of peaks may
vary slightly between runs or capillaries - may also re-
duce some noise in your data. Especially if you have a
lot of markers that are quite close to each other and/or
many diverse populations or even species. Hope this
helps & good luck with your work! Sarka

Hi Marrianne,
I have been wrestling with my AFLP’s for a couple of
years now, so I can tell you what I’ve learned. I’d be
interested to hear what others advise you as well.
Abundant noise is common for AFLP’s, as well as prob-
lems with changes in signal strength between runs, and
diﬀerences in peak size due to heterozygosity and su-
perimposition of diﬀerent fragments of the same length.
Because of these things, it is appropriate to limit your
’loci’ to those that you can score reliably, even in weak
samples. I focus on peaks that appear several times the
strength of the background noise in at least some sam-
ples, then go through and look carefully for peaks of any
size in those positions in the other samples. I do not feel
that diﬀerentiation of heterozygotes and homozygotes
is possible or reliable or distinguishable from superim-
posed fragments of diﬀerent origin, so I score any size
peak at a locus equally. It is important to run samples
in a randomized manner and to run some duplicates in
order to verify that

AFLP scoring answers
Hi everybody, Thankyou very much for your answers.
I have attached a ﬁle containing them all.
To summarize I found that not only I ﬁnd it diﬃcult
and quite subjective to score AFLP peaks. (thanks
that was nice to hear). The advise adds up to making
the DNA quality as good as possible. Running at least
some samples twice to check the error percent. Try to
standazise the samples ampliﬁcation. Choose a minor
level eg. 10 percent of largest peak.
And ofcause it is advisable to mix samples on gels and
scoring without knowing the origin of the sample. Also
I will score some more peaks so I have at least 125 good
ones for my analysis.
Thankyou again for your help.

to 2bp and scores 96 samples for c. £20. Unfortunately
you’ll only be able to score one loci at a time but it
provides a relatively cheap solution with a small set up
cost. You can stain the gels with Syber gold which is
less time consuming than silver staining. The gels are
fairly robust but you need a special rig and power pack
to run them. The obvious alternative is a sequencer if
you run your PCR products in a multiplex PCR etc.
Our company charges £2.00 per run. For instance we
use an eight primer multiplex PCR to genotype cherries
which makes it a more cost eﬀective solution. Best of
luck. Jake Hi
We use a Licor sequencer and we are very happy be-
cause the reagents and glass for gels are very cheap.
We only have one banding colour but it works quit well
and you can do a lot of PCR’s on multipelx depending
on mSats number of bp.
Good luck
Best regards Hello Dr. Verardi, I am responding to
the email you sent to the EvolDir concerning scoring
of microsatellite data. Our not-for-proﬁt facility (in
Canada) does this for academic labs at a very reason-
able cost (on our ABI 3730 instruments)- what is your
sample size and number of loci (are they multiplexed
or pooled). I would happy to give you an estimate for
this, if you decide not to purchase an instrument for
your facility. However, I would recommend the ABI
3100 instrument as a reasonably-priced instrument to
score ﬂuorescently-labelled microsatellite fragments - it
can run approx. 3 plates of 96 samples per day. Best
Regards, Tara Paton Hi Andrea,
One alternative would be to look for a used sequenc-
ing machine. It’s likely that this may actually be just
as, or more, expensive as sending samples out but you
never know. Maybe something on e-bay or other used
lab equipment sites. The only caution there is whether
you can still obtain the necessary supplies to continue
running the machine. Actually, one more caution is
whether the machine you decide on has a history of
problems. If so, you would want to make sure that the
manufactuer still supports the machine.
Another alternative may be to try to collaborate with
someone at an institution that already has a sequencer.
You could prepare all of you samples locally and then
spend a bit of time in the lab of someone who has a
bit of space and would be willing to sponsor you. Just
another thing to consider.
Good luck!
Hi Andrea, I know of cheaper prices for sequencing work
at Cardiﬀ University - they are one of the cheapest ser-
vices but still relatively expensive. There is also a se-quencing service in Korea Macrogen but you have to
ship it there and you really have to do above a certain
number of runs before it becomes worth while but sur-
prisingly if you have enough it can be one of the best
options. In the UK there is a NERC facility that ytou
can apply for a sheﬃeld University but I’m not sure
what the eligibility foir this facility is exactly. If you
need further information on any of these let me know
and I’ll give you some more details.
If you ﬁnd out about any other good cheap facilities
that are better than the ones I’ve listed please could
you pass on the details. Good luck, Vittoria
I am currently using a Li-cor system (4300) and I have
previously used a Corbett Research GelScan2000. Both
are very useable. The Gelscan is cheaper and I could
push samples through quicker, but is only has one chan-
nel and, outside of Australia where Corbett is based,
support is poor. The Li-cor is more expensive, may
take longer (but could actually be as fast with the short
plates. I only have the long plates) but it has two chan-
nels (i.e., you can run two diﬀerent colored dyes at the
same time) and probably has better support. The dyes
are quite expensive for the Li-cor machine, whereas the
Corbett machine uses the same dyes as PE machines.
Hope that helps. Any further questions, drop me a line.

We use LiCor DNA sequencers to score microsatellites.
They’re reliable, and the customer support is outstand-
ing (much better than ABI).

Contig Assembly Update
Dear Colleagues,
Last summer I posted a plea for DNA sequence edit-
ing software that would 1) align contigs (to each other,
across individuals), 2) allow access to chromatograms
with a simple mouse click (so that data can be com-
pared quickly and easily both between primer reads
from one individual and between multiple individuals
in a data set), 3) work with Beckman sequencer data, 4)
be economical for evolutionary biologists without huge
grants, and 5) be relatively easy to use and bug-free.
At that time, I felt positive about the Codon-
Code Aligner ( http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/-
new.htm ) program that did many of these things, but
did not do #1, a feature that I had only seen in the cum-
bersome and expensive ABI SeqScape program. I am
happy to report that the new version of Aligner (1.5.1)
will make a contig of contigs and thus satisﬁes criterion
#1. It does NOT require a reference sequence. The
cost for the ﬁrst license is unchanged ($960 US), but
the price of the second license has increased a bit (from
$480 US to $720 US). This is still an excellent bargain
compared to Sequencher and Seqscape and many other
programs. CodonCode Aligner is easy to use and the
developers are responsive to suggestions.
I don’t work for these guys, and have no ﬁnancial in-
terest in the product. I don’t even know them. I am
just psyched to share a solution that will save me (and
many others based on the responses to my ﬁrst mes-
sage) many hours of sequence editing.
Thanks,

DNA from etoh
Dear colleagues,We are conducting a population genetic study in our
lab with charr and other salmonid microsatellites. At
present we are having real problems with extracting
good quality DNA from our older ﬁn clip samples,
which have been stored in ethanol for around 10+ years
(in +4 C). Can any of you give us some advice on how to
get our extraction protocols working on older samples
too?
The protocols we’ve been using are as follows:
Ethanol removal (for 1+ year old samples only): Re-
move ethanol from eppendorf tubes and add an equal
amount of 0,1x TE buﬀer, incubate overnight.
Proteinase K digestion: Mix 5600ul salt extraction
buﬀer, 560ul 20% SDS and 130ul proteinase K, then
add 60 µl of this mix to each well of the 96-well plate.
Add tissue piece(s) (ca 1 mm3) and seal with strip caps.
Incubate @ 60 C for a few hours
DNA extraction: The protocol is basically the glass
beads extraction method described in: Elphinstone,
MS, Hinten, GN, Anderson, MJ & Nock CJ 2003. An
inexpensive and high-throughput procedure to extract
and purify total genomic DNA for population studies.
Mol. Ecol. Notes 3:317320.
(More detailed workﬂow can be downloaded
from http://users.utu.ﬁ/albval/tutkimus/M13-
Tailed PCR.pdf )
The protocol (without ethanol removal) and used PCR
primers work well with new samples. Using the TE-
buﬀer incubation we’ve been able to get good results
also from samples 5+ years old. Only with the 10+
years old samples the amount and quality of extracted
DNA is too poor for most PCR reactions, although a
few loci in a few individuals manage to amplify.

Diﬃculties Scoring AFLP
Hi everybody,
I hope that somebody can help me! I have problems
with to much noise in my AFLP dataset. First I scored
all peaks of 20 or over which gives so much noise thatmy populations does not come out with the other pop-
ulations of the same species. Also it is only possible
to reallocate (using AFLPOP) 47% back into the pop-
ulation of origin. The results seem much better if I
use only peaks of 50 or over in Genotyper, but does
that not leave to much information out? It leaves out
many smaller peaks. This is my ﬁrst time using these
methods, so I feel quite insequre about what is most
correct.

EtOH DNA
Dear evoldir members,
I am having diﬃculties in extracting DNA from some
old (>10 years) ethanol preserved tissue samples. My
extracts contain DNA but its quality is very low. I am
guessing they contain too many short fragments which
inhibit the ampliﬁcation of the gene i need (mithocon-
drial Dloop control region). I have tried to amplify
both a short part of the gene (around 500 bp) and the
complete sequence (around 900 bp) but none worked.
I would like to ask if anyone knows of some way to re-
move the shorter DNA fragments keeping only the big-
ger ones. I have tried running the extracts on agarose
gel and then purifying the DNA from the gel, but it
doesnt work (maybe the DNA concentration prior toPCR is not high enough to allow it?). Any help would
be much appreciated, my email is below,

Here are the responses about my ExoSAP-IT post. I
did not post all of them but this gives the range of an-
swers. The bottom line is you can use ’much less’ and
buy the reagents separately to ’save money’-that’s what
I like to hear. The answers should interest many of you
out there.
Thanks so much. Greg

We make up our own concoction of Exonuclease I and
Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase that works great.
To 5ul PCR product, add 0.5ul of 1U/ul SAP + 0.5ul of
10U/ul ExoI. Incubate in a thermal cycler 30 minutes
at 37degs then 15 minutes at 80degs.
Both chemicals are sold separately by GE Healthcare
(formerly Amersham Biosciences).
We usually make up a fresh “ExoSAP” mastermix ev-
erytime we do a round of PCR and add 1ul of the mas-
termix to 5ul product. I’ve never experimented with
making up batch volumes for further down the road,
but feel free to try and let us know if it works! If you
need more product for sequencing, just scale up.
Hope that helps! Elizabeth

Hi Greg, I have successfully used 2 ul of exosapit /
10ul reaction. To test this, I mixed the same amount
of product with diﬀerent amounts of exosapit , then
compared the sequence data. If it looks good with less
exosapit, then you can probably get away with less.
Hope this helps, Jen Knies UNC-Chapel Hill
************** Dear Greg,
We also use ExoSAP-IT in my lab. We routinely use 1
ul of ExoSAP-IT for 5 ul PCR product rather than therecommended 2 ul. I have not tested it further to see if
0.5 ul or less would also work. However, we are also now
saving a lot of money by making our own ExoSAP-IT.
Here’s the recipe.

USB cat# 70092Y) 100 ul Total It works great! I
couldn’t believe it when someone ﬁrst brought it to my
attention because you don’t use any buﬀer. I thought
for sure the enzymes would denature. But they don’t
and it works just as well as the premixed ExoSAP-IT
we used to buy from USB.
I mix it up in 100 ul batches about 5 at a time and
keep them in the -20 and they seem to last pretty much
indeﬁnitely.
Good luck!

GeoDis problems
I am working on my thesis using GeoDis 2.4 looking
at phylogeographic gene ﬂow of Horned Lizards. The
problem is that the program is having issues with my
input ﬁles. Here is an example-
Clade 1-1 2 II III 1 0 1 1 1 1
Error message reads : the number of haplotypes for
location X can not be one-you need genetic variation
for this analysis. I do believe that II and III of line 3
represents 2 haplotypes! I’ve tried entering 2 i.e. 2 hap-
lotypes at location 1-same thing (2 was entered for line
7) Also just entering 1 under location 1 just to see-same
thing Another example
Clade 3-3 2 2-5 2-2 1 0 2 2 5 1 0 0 1
The program error is the same-it ﬂags location 2 as be-
ing problematic and not 5. The same thing happens
in another ﬁle and the clade is ﬂanked before and after
with clades that have the exact same scenario (clade
1-1 o.k 1-2 not o.k 1-3 ﬁne). Why it chose the middle
one and was happy with the rest-I don’t know. If you
have any insight into this, I would welcome your help.

Help with Migrate answers 2
Dear Tatjana and other evoldir members.
I want to make a couple of comments to some of the
comments you got.
***Consistency of results of ML programs, such as mi-
grate, ﬂuctuate, lamarc, .... (or Bayesian programs such
as IM, etc) MCMC is diﬃcult as Joseph clearly out-
lined, programs based on MCMC can fail for various
reasons, the most common one is that the programsApril 1, 2006 EvolDir 47
are not run long enough. This is especially serious with
data that is not very informative (for example has only
few variable sites) and were researchers have sampled
many individuals.
- few variable sites: It is obvious that results will be
hard to obtain if there is nothing to show diﬀerenti-
ation, with MCMC-ML (likelihood approximated by
MCMC) almost every change will be accepted resulting
in a Brownian motion walk in the solution space, and of
course short runs will deliver diﬀerent results, MCMC
is working only in the limit, so for such data every
run might be too short. MCMC-Bayes in contrast to
MCMC-ML is changing the driving value (often called
parameter 0, or Theta 0) using a prior distribution for
the MCMC chain more often than the MCMC-ML runs
where the driving values is typically ﬁxed. If no infor-
mation is contained in the data the prior is deﬁning
the outcome. It is important to recognize that under
Bayes failure to achieve good results delivers the prior
distribution (several runs actually will deliver the same
result when run using the same prior) whereas ML de-
livers diﬀerent MLE estimates and we then consider the
results inconsistent. With Bayesian programs, like IM,
you need to be able to distinguish informative posterior
(data is overpowering the prior) versus posterior is sim-
ilar to the prior (prior is overpowering the data). To my
knowledge IM or the other Bayesian programs out there
(migrate-bayes included) do not produce good statistics
on this, yet. A immediate solution is to use diﬀerent
prior settings and compare the posteriors (if the data
is informative the will look the same). Of course one
always can run these programs with no data and com-
pare with the data-runs, but this will work only if all
parameters fail to be pushed the data [the population
sizes are most often much easier to estimate than the
migration rates].
- variable data but very complex scenario: I get often
email about diﬃculties to run on machine x that turns
out to be often a problem that is unrelated to computers
but to researchers (and perhaps the manual). Programs
like migrate can estimate a large number of parameters:
in fact from 1 to n*n+1, where n is the number of pop-
ulations. You can imagine that a researcher has investi-
gated 10 populations - >typically a default migrate run
will try to estimate 100 parameters. Now, if you sample
20 individuals per population then you will have 200 in-
dividuals, for single locus data this is not a lot of data
to estimate the 100 parameters and most often such an
analysis will fail because many of the individuals are
“relatives’ and so not perfect replicates. Would you run
a regression analysis with 100 parameters and 200 data
points? Probably not with lots of conﬁdence. Another
problem is that sometimes researchers have sampled 5populations (25 parameters) and have 300 individuals
per populations. In principle this is good, but because
of the MCMC runs, we need to calculate likelihoods
on large trees (1500 for the example), in phylogenetic
research, people believe that this is a very diﬃcult
problem. As a result the MCMC runs will not explore
the solution space exhaustively, in short, the runs will
be to short and return inconsistent results. A remedy of
this is to subsample each population randomly and run
10 or 20 individuals per population. Pluzhnikov and
Donnelly (1996) and Felsenstein (2006) describe that
results from coalescent studies show smallest variance
when sampling about 6-10 individuals per locus but us-
ing many loci: so a study with 1500 individuals and 1
locus will produce worse results than to a study with
150 individuals and 10 loci.
*** Estimates from many populations (e.g. migrate,
lamarc, batwing, genetree , ...) versus pairwise esti-
mators (FST based, IM) In the standard statistical lit-
erature they tell you that is a very bad thing to test
pairs of sets of data when their is interaction among all
sets , that’s why people use Bonferoni correction and
the like. For estimation of molecular clock or time of
divergence in earlier times researchers used pairs and
calibrated Nei distance and geology events, these pro-
cedures are almost completely abandoned because su-
perior methods that can take all lineages jointly into

caveat holds for population genetics studies, I do not

Greetings colleagues,
I’m sure it will not surprise you to hear that the politi-
cal forces pushing for the teaching of intelligent design
in high school biology classes have made their way into
another state. This time I am sad to say it is my own
- Nevada. Here is a link to a recent news paper article
announcing the initiative:48 EvolDir April 1, 2006

It looks like they are continuing to adapt their rhetoric
in response to past failures in the courts. The telling
phrase this time is that they want high school biol-
ogy teachers to “teach the evolution controversy” as
opposed to evolution per se.
Here we go again.

Introduced Species
Dear EvolDir Members,
I am conducting a meta-analysis on ’common garden’
studies on introduced species and would be grateful to
hear if anyone knows of any additional studies that I
have missed. In particular, I have focused on plants
and I am hoping to add some animal studies for non-
drosophilid species. Below is a list studies I have al-
ready included. Please note that I am only interested
in studies that (a) use populations of the same species
from both its native and introduced range, and (b)
grow/raise individuals in a common garden/laboratory
setting. It isn’t necessary that these studies control for
maternal eﬀects or include family structure. Thanks in
advance.

Large trees
Dear members
I am currently attempting to analyse a data set with
around 120 taxa and between 1200-1900 characters,
to create a phylogenetic tree. At present I am using
PAUP* to do this, and have used Mrbayes for bayesian
analyses, both of which are taking huge amounts of
time to run! Apart from the slowness created by the
large number of taxa, many of the taxa are less than
1%diﬀerent, causing repeated, ineﬃcient terminal node
swapping. If anyone has any suggestions (or moral sup-
port) that may help I would be inﬁnately grateful! A
collegue has suggested TNT (Tree Analysis using New
Technology) which I am at present unfamiliar with, any
feedback on this would be great

ﬂanking sequences and information about other SNPs
in that ﬂanking sequence. I know the software SN-
Phunter ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ppg/software )
does precisely this, but I am looking for a program in
which you can do batch queries for speciﬁc SNPs us-

The batch queries of SNPhunter only involve genes, as
far as I know, and my SNPs are not associated with

Microsat problems answers
Hi everyone, I would just like to apologize for the delay
in posting the responses and say thank you to everyone
who oﬀered advice, it was very much appreciated.
Deborah
INITIAL EMAIL
Hi, I have been developing microsatellites for 3 species
of Galatheidae for the past year and although the de-
velopmental process went well and plasmid sequencing
gave microsatellites and ﬂanking regions which were
suﬃcient to develop primers I am now having prob-
lems with optimisation and ampliﬁcation. I am some-
how amplifying product of incorrect size (as to what
the primers were designed for- larger fragments) and
am getting multiple bands and lots of background noise
when trying to screen samples. Of the two micros that Ihave managed to optimise the screening concluded that
they were uninformative (everything I screened includ-
ing 19 adult individuals from a single area as well as
a mother and 75 eggs where all found to have identi-
cal heterozygote bands!). I am confused by this result
and was wondering if anyone has had similar problems
with crustaceans or could oﬀer advice as to possible
problems that could be causing this or how to proceed.
Thanking you in advance for any comments you could
oﬀer
Deborah
VERY KIND AND MUCH APPRECIATED RE-
SPONSES:
* I haven’t much experience with crustaceans but I
would’ve thought that mining non-unique sequences
by chance was very unlucky. I realise that enrich-
ment success is species dependant but I need to know
more about your protocols before I can oﬀer advice.
Have you tried SSCP with your ’monomorphic’ primers
to check whether there’s any conformational polymor-
phism? Perhaps you could look on the database
for EST sequences to see whether you can design
SSR markers from them. Jake Jake Clarke (EMR)
[Jake.Clarke@emr.ac.uk]
* Have you tried a HotStart Taq, touchdown, and
touchup PCR??? Cheers, Fabio
Fabio M. Diniz [F.M.DINIZ@soton.ac.uk]
* I have experience with plant and insect microsatel-
lites, but not Crustacean, so I can not really comment if
your ampliﬁcation problems are species-speciﬁc... Nev-
ertheless, some hints perhaps: Although you have not
mentioned the PCR conditions, I suppose you have
tried selective conditions (e.g. higher annealing tem-
perature), in order to amplify only speciﬁc bands. So,
if you do get multiple bands or incorrect size, can be
that your primers match with more sequences and so
amplify more/diﬀerent loci, in fact. Perhaps, the best
to check on that is to cut out the suspicious bands from
the gel and sequence them. Thus, you can precisely
check whether you have ampliﬁed microsatellites. If so,
you may then decide to try and re-design the primers.
Also, you have not speciﬁed what is diﬀerence from ex-
pected and your observed length ...my own experience is
that some microsatellite loci can amplify alleles within
relatively broad range like 90 bp or so.

and general 2/ technical to do with this organism 3/

1/ can be ruled out if you can borrow some microsatel-

primers anyway that could supplement microsatellites
3/ some organisms are just hard. you probably know
the crustacean literature. I seem to remember that
Shane Lavery found that prawns have very long pure
repeats that were stuttery, and other decapod studies
have had a hard time too.
There are lots of reasons for microsatellites to fail -
invertebrates seem to be generally a lot more diﬃcult
and unpredictable in yielding good loci. In my group
we have encountered some very diﬃcult animals. My
advice would be that if you work out that 3/ above
applies, you have a few more goes at a few more mi-
crosatellites, then try alternative approaches (Garrick

Many thanks for all your helpful suggestions with the

that it is not a very reliable program and others gave
some suggestions for the program parameters. I’ve

might need them.

Hi Tatiana,
I’ve played around with Migrate some myself. Before
you continue, I would take a serious look at the fol-
lowing article: Evaluating the performance of likeli-
hood methods for detecting population structure and
migration ZAID Abdo, Keith A. Crandall, PAUL Joyce
Molecular Ecology 2004 13:4 837
They ﬁnd that the results from Migrate are not very
reliable or accurate. I might choose diﬀerent software
(Jody Hey’s IM, Prtichard’s STRUCTURE, etc.) to
get at this question.
-Jeﬀ
Hi Tatiana - I’ve had major problems with consistency
for the Migrate, Fluctuate, Lamarc programs and de-
spite multiple runs of the same dataset, I never got
convergence. Depending on which way the wind blows,
you will get all kinds of numbers. Like ﬂipping a coin.
It doesn’t matter what your starting parameters are or
number of chains.. the programs are horrible. So, I sug-
gest you steer clear of that batch of programs - there’s
a paper about Migrate by Paul Joyce, Zaid Abdo, and
Keith Crandall that shows how bad the Migrate pro-
gram is - it’s in Mol Ecol. Most of the time, Migrate
didn’t ﬁnd the simulated theta within the 95% conﬁ-
dence interval... and worse yet, it was *really* far oﬀ
most of the time.
There is a program called IM by Jody Hey (he’s at Rut-
gers) which does consistently give you “ballpark” theta
and migration estimates. I typically do 10 identical
runs to watch if they are converging, and I mark down52 EvolDir April 1, 2006
the estimates. You have to run 2 populations at a time,
so you get a theta 1, theta 2, theta ancestral, m1, m2,
and time since divergence. I haven’t used the program
yet for usats, but it takes sequence data and usats. I
then cancel the runs that are really diﬀerent from the
others... typically, 2 or 3 will converge on some strange
number while all the others will hit the same ballpark.
Then I take the run that falls in the middle of that
convergent set and let it run until the eﬀective sample
sizes (ESSs) for time to convergence are well over 1000.
This means I let the thing run for a few weeks. You’ll
get an output ﬁle that has probabilities for each of the
estimates (theta, m, and t) and 90% posterior density
conﬁdence intervals. I used IM for my Mol Ecol paper
- it’s in the Dec 2005 issue... cave crayﬁsh with Keith
Crandall. And Rasmus Nielsen and Jody Hey are great
and have published in Genetics using usat data for the
IM program - they actually write back and respond to
your questions, unlike the Lamarc crew.
I hope that helps, Jen
Other people may have more detailed/technical sugges-
tions...
A simple thing you can do is repeat the analysis. If
the results are very diﬀerent (eg. no or small overlap in
conﬁdence intervals for parameters) you deﬁnitely need
to run it for longer. Also if the conﬁdence intervals are
large, you may need to run it for longer, although I
would not like to specify how large is too large.
Hope this helps.
Karen Bell [karen.bell@wku.edu]
I would suggest you to start with FST values. Do some
runs with say 10 short chains and 1 long chain starting
with diﬀerent random seed numbers. Try to play with
parameter that explore the sample space, such as how
many trees to discard etc. Compare the results and see
if they converged to something common or if the results
are completely disparate. You will acquire conﬁdence
in your runs as you see the results and experiment with
the parameters. Once you are conﬁdent with the pa-
rameters you prepare the “oﬃcial” run with the param-
eter set you have determined in your trials. Follow the
manual for that and try to optimize the number of runs
in relation to the computer time and power you have
available. Do three or four runs, starting the ﬁrst with
FST parameters and the subsequent with what you ob-
tained in the previous. Do a single very long run at
last.
Good luck
Julianno
Hello Tatiana. I have run Migrate ad inﬁnitum, andso hope I can oﬀer some good suggestions. First I’ll
give you my advice, and then a blurb from something
I wrote on MCMC sampling a while ago, if you are
interested.
Running the Program 1) Run it multiple times, starting
from random positions in parameter space. If you get
consistent results, you be conﬁdent that you have sam-
pled adequately. 2) Use heated chains, typically one
cold and three hot (NOTE: this is not a default for the
program, so you will have to specify this in your parm-
ﬁle). This will greatly improve convergence and mixing
of the chains. Please note, however, that adding heated
chains will slow down your analysis substantially (you
are doing four searches rather than

proportions of gene ﬂow among populations using Y-

but I don’t know if the results I get are reliable or not.
The program allows to set many parameters and for
many of them I used the default setting. Because I

using a small number of chains. Could someone be so
kind to give me some suggestions? What “start param-

We use a partial order graph approach implemented in
POA ( http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poa/ ) for
some of our work. However, this is mainly because it
scoots the unaligned sequences to the end for easy trim-
ming with the initial settings we tried. I have also heard
the some of the EST alignment methods do something
similar.
There is no optimal alignment. Usually the goal is to
try and align sites that share a common ancestry. Thus
there is a circular problem of wanting to use a tree to
build the alignment. Then using the alignment to build54 EvolDir April 1, 2006
a tree. The use of Bayesian approaches that allow the
incorporation of prior knowledge is rapidly changing
this ﬁeld, but there is no easy answer. </response >
<response > >From Ilya Nemenman:
Another objective, and formally very sound, way to
quantify the sequence similarity is to measure the
length of the shortest program that can transform one
sequence into another. This is obviously related to Kol-
mogorov complexity, and Li and Vitanyi, some of the
biggest names in the theory of algorithmic complex-
ity in the recent years, have worked on this subject.
The algorithm, described in http://www.ams.org/-
mathscinet-getitem?mr=2005f%3A68028 works quite
nicely for phylogeny studies. There might have been
later works on this approach, but I am, unfortunately,
unfamiliar with them. </response >
<response > >From Joe Felsenstein:
Why do you think that the issue has never been ad-
dressed? There is an active literature on statistical ap-
proaches to multiple sequence alignment, using mod-
els of insertion and deletion (there are major unsolved
problems, including treatment of multiple-base inser-
tions and deletions). The literature goes back to Bishop
and Thompson 1986 and to Thorne et al. 1991 and
1992. In addition there is a minimum message length
approach of Allison and Yee (1990). References are in
my phylogenies book (2004), chapter 29. </response >
<response > >From Will Fischer:
This is an excellent question, and there is distressingly
little formal work in the area. Most “alignment ac-
curacy” studies simply compare the alignments from
algorithm A or algorithm B to a set of hand-curated
alignments, e.g. BaliBase.
One objective criterion for alignment quality is the
length of the most parsimonious tree derived from the
alignment – this is unfortunately too time-consuming
to compute for each step of an alignment procedure,
but can be used to compare alignments from diﬀerent
methods.
I would encourage you to explore some alternatives to
the programs you are using:
muscle ( www.drive5.com/muscle ) is freely available, is
much faster than either clustalw or t-coﬀee, and pro-
duces excellent amino-acid alignments (certainly more
accurate than clustalw’s, and as good or better than
t-coﬀee’s according to published data; I haven’t done
a side-by-side muscle/t-coﬀee comparison since t-coﬀee
is so slow). Nucleotide alignments may require more
post-alignment tweaking than amino acids. It builds
an initial guide tree using common-substring counts.Muscle references: http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/-

This seems to be an issue of fundamental importance in
phylogenetic inference, as the quality of a tree is limited
by the quality of the input alignment.
Alternatively, does there exist an algorithm that will
utilize amino acid translations to inform alignment of
nucleotide sequences?
Thank you, and best regards,

Munidopsis mtDNA polymorphism
Hi, I am working with the squat lobster Munidopsis
polymorpha, and I have several problems with the mi-
tochondrial DNA ampliﬁcations and restriction digests.
I have tried to clean my samples using various methods,
including columns from Qiagen and the ChargeSwitchApril 1, 2006 EvolDir 55
system from Invitrogen. I have also tried more standard
methods such as diluting the DNA template, changing
Taq and using agents such as BSA. For the digests, I
have tried diluting the DNA and adding more enzyme.
The extracted DNA is of good quality and the solution
is clear with no visible pigment. However, I continue to
have problems, suggesting that some form of inhibitor
is co-amplifying with the DNA. I will be grateful for
any ideas on how to resolve this problem or to hear
from people who have encountered similar problems.

Notropis stramineus samples
Dear All, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University
of Kansas and am studying the phylogeography of the
Sand Shiner (Notropis stramineus). I am in need of ad-
ditional samples to supplement my work (particularly
from the northern reaches of its distribution). I would
greatly appreciate any ethanol preserved samples that
others could supply. If you would be willing to collect
some specimens, please contact me. Thanks!
N. stramineus is a commonly occurring and widespreadminnow species in eastern North America. For a map

Phylogenetic trees replies
Dear Members
Many thanks for all your helpful replies in my prob-
lem of resolving a phylogenetic tree with <1-2% se-
quence diﬀerence between taxa. In summary, the pro-
grams TNT, PAUP ratchet, PhyML, Repeated Heuris-
tic searches using PAUP MP, and collapsing data into
groups with <’a threshold’ diﬀerence, were the main
suggestions to get a tree search to at least complete, or
take less time than in a conventional PAUP analysis.
As a general note, for the suggestions I have tried so
far, time taken has been improved (although with the
inherant problem of too little information in the data,
resolution has not). For anyone who would like more
details feel free to email me directly,

Protein alignment
Dear colleagues,
I got a relatively large dataset of protein-coding genes,
and I’m looking for the best way to align it. I’m aware
of approaches that use things like BLOSUM matrices,
but I’d like to use a method that does both tree search
and alignment simultaneously (e.g. the optimization
alignment used in POY, although I’m not aware of a
way to set it up so that it won’t allow gaps only be-
tween codons). Any suggestions?
Best,
Jason

Dear Colleagues
A new version of FaMoz is now available freely on in-
ternet at this address: http://www.pierroton.inra.fr/-
genetics/labo/Software/Famoz In this version, you can
now look for most likely fathers or parent/parent pairs
of some oﬀspring with codominant, dominant, cytoplas-
mic markers (or combinations of these), using log like-
lihood ratio (lod score) AND/OR delta scores of each
father/parent/parent pair. Delta was not available be-
fore, you can build tests with delta exactly the way it
was done with lod-scores, and compare the quality of
the diﬀerent tests thanks to simulations.
Gene ﬂow can be simulated and evaluated, in a diﬀerent
manner than before. The size of the total reproducing
population, a value diﬃcult to obtain in an easy way, is
not used anymore by the simulation step, with an orig-
inal idea from Olivier Hardy (thanks Olivier !). YouApril 1, 2006 EvolDir 59
only need the observed gene ﬂow observed in your ex-
periement after the paternity or parentage test. The
diﬀerent types of gene ﬂow observed after the simula-
tion are given (real, apparent, cryptic gene ﬂow, ...).
Any feedback is very wellcome

SOFTWARE: for organizing sequences, alignments,
phylogenetics trees and abstracts
We have recently released a new software system
(Geneious version 0.9e) which allows evolutionary biol-
ogists to easily manage their data and access web-based
databases such as NCBI. It also integrates several core
tasks that are essential for evolutionary biologists to
perform quickly, often and easily, including
* phylogenetic reconstruction (NJ with bootstrapping)
* tree viewing * pairwise sequence alignment * multi-
ple sequence alignment * dot plots * sequence viewing,
including sequence annotations from NCBI database *
translating from DNA to amino acids * export to End-
note, Nexus, Newick, Fasta * import trees, sequences
alignments and bibliographies in a variety of formats *
adding user information and notes to sequences, align-
ments and trees
The novel thing about this software is that for the ﬁrst
time these tasks can now be done in an integrated way
using a tool that also allows local database storage
and retrieval of all sequences, proteins, and research
publications in formats including PDF. The result is
that much of the drudgery of downloading, sorting and
analysing sequences is now streamlined, so that you can
spend more time on genuine research. The other major
innovation is that any existing bioinformatics applica-
tions that you are using can be rapidly integrated into
the product so that your workﬂow becomes even faster.
- Signiﬁcantly increases your chance of ﬁnding the re-
search paper you are looking for - in minutes, not hours
- and being automatically told when new ones come
in - Organise, search, and perform non-exact searches
through all PDF- format research publications for key-
words - By creating a well-organised searchable, contin-
uously updating local database of sequences, you can
perform much more complicated searches and analyses
much quicker than if you had to search from scratch on
the whole of NCBI and/or EBI each time
You can download Geneious without charge at
www.geneious.com . Versions for Mac OS X, Windows
and Linux are available.
Geneious will grow as we continue to build new tools
through open- source upgrades and new features. We
will plan to focus special attention on developing analy-60 EvolDir April 1, 2006
sis tools for sequence alignment and phylogenetics and
welcome any and all feedback on current and future
features in the product.
Biomatters plans to release version 1.0 of Geneious in
Q2 2006.

Software IBDWS 2 6
Colleagues,
We have posted an update to Isolation By Distance,
Web Service (IBDWS). (current version is 2.6)
IBDWS is a specialized package for isolation by dis-
tance analyses of codominant markers (raw data), or
user-provided distance matrices for any type of data.
IBDWS is hosted at http://phage.sdsu.edu/˜jensen/
Recent improvements include a cleaner user interface
and some minor bug ﬁxes. Most signiﬁcantly, you now
have the ability to return to the IBDWS page and re-
trieve results for large analyses that take a signiﬁcant
amount of time to run. (Most web browsers time out
in 2-5 minutes.)

Hello EvolDir
I have ﬁnished the development of a new version of the
ModelTest interface, MTgui. The new version 1.5 is
only available to Windows systems at the moment, and
the Linux new version will be out soon.
Version 1.5 is a major improvement on the last available
release and includes the possibility of running PAUP
from the interface directly. By clicking a button and
selecting your NEXUS ﬁle, MTgui will start PAUP, run
the modelblock and run ModelTest at the end. All you
need to do is check the result and edit your NEXUS ﬁle
(and you can do this by clicking another button).
This feature was only tested with the PAUP4b10 con-
sole version (command line, DOS version), as I do not
have a full PAUP Windows version to test.
MTgui 1.5 is available at:
http://www.genedrift.org (click on software and then
on MTgui)
If someone is interested in helping the development of
this simple, yet useful interface, or has interest in creat-
ing anf interface for some other command-line tool just
send me an email.
Thanks for the interest.

Software TRANSFORMER-3
Dear colleagues, We are announcing the release of
TRANSFORMER-3, a computer program for the anal-
ysis of molecular population genetic data which is suit-
able for codominant (allozyme or microsatellite) and
dominant (AFLP, RAPD, RFLP, PCR-RFLP) matrices
for at least 60 enzyme/primers with up to 10 loci (each
containing a maximum of 20 alleles) per enzyme/primer
in 65,000 diploid individuals.
At present, the program transforms raw genotype data
or (only for allozymes) drawings of the gel interpreta-
tions to the formats of Arlequin, BIOSYS, Bottleneck,April 1, 2006 EvolDir 61
Fstat, GenePop, Genestat, PopGene, NTSYS-pc and
SPAGeDI (codominant data), and Arlequin AFLPsurv,
GDA, GenAlex, PopGene, NTSYS-pc, PASSAGE and
SPAGeDI (dominant data) for any groupings of popula-
tions the user may be interested in. Thus, the program
allows you to deﬁne population subsets, compare inde-
pendent groups of populations, include the same popu-
lation(s) in more than one group and make all possible
data combinations you can think of just with a few
easy mouse clicks and without formatting errors. For
co-dominant data only, it also calculates all the param-
eters related to the probabilities of allelic loss (sensu
Bengtsson et al. 1995).
Through saving a lot of research time while increasing
accuracy and versatility in data analyses, Transformer-
3 permits the eﬀective implementation of urgency in
the growing number of practical applications of molec-
ular population genetic information, and allows the re-
searcher to concentrate in what really matters: the crit-
ical discussion of results and hypotheses.
This program is the result of a collaborative eﬀort
between the Laboratorio de Biodiversidad Molecular
at the Jardin Botanico Canario Viera y Clavijo and
the Departamento de Software of EXEGEN. It can be
downloaded without charge under the link “software”
at the web page of EXEGEN
http://www.exegen.org Users just have to provide a
valid email address to which EXEGEN will send the
link where the program, the example ﬁles and the users
manual can be downloaded. A mailing list will also
send them updates and other information concerning
future developments of the Transformer project.
Use the program only in a PC and avoid Windows
XP. Since Transformer-3 runs macros, check that your
macro security is set at least to medium, and also make
sure that you do not have Excel add-ins in your com-
puter, as these might interfere with some commands in
Transformer-3.
Transformer-3 can be downloaded without charge, and
may be distributed freely if and when (i) it does not un-
dergo any modiﬁcation, (ii) the manual and the three
example ﬁles are attached without changes, and (iii) it
is adequately cited in all papers and communications
as follows:

Software goldMINER
Dear All,
I am releasing a Windows software goldMINER to the
scientiﬁc community at:
http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/goldminer.asp
The software was originally written to annotate a large
set of ESTs (expressed sequence tags) from goldﬁsh
brain in a study to elucidate the response of gold-
ﬁsh to environmental hormone-like chemicals (espe-
cially estrogen-like chemicals). Hence the gold part in
its name.
goldMINER is the ﬁrst EST annotation software
that automate functional annotation by using the
Conserved-Domain Database (CDD, which imported
and valided functional classiﬁcations from pFAM,
SMART, COG, etc., and added many functional an-
notations of proteins curated by NCBI staﬀ led by A.
Marchler-Bauer). CDD is, in my view, the best one-
stop database for functional annotation of unknown se-
quences.
If you happen to have ESTs or whatever unknown se-
quences and you wish to know its detailed function,62 EvolDir April 1, 2006
then you will be impressed by goldMINER’s function-
ality.
Online help is provided in the form of a tutorial. Just
press F1 after starting goldMINER.

TREEs birthday cover
Subject heading: Faces of the future.
We are editing two special issues of Trends in Ecology
and Evolution to mark TREE’s 20th birthday. These
issues take a hard look at the future of our subject, and
to celebrate this, we would like to construct one of the
covers as a collage of the people who are the future:
the graduate students and young post-docs of today.
A poster size rendition of the cover is also likely to be
produced.
If you would like to appear in this visualisation of thenext twenty years, please send a picture of yourself to
tree@elsevier.com by the end of March, along with the
statement of permission below. The pictures will be
used without attribution. The pictures will be small on
the cover, so we need faces only, and ﬁlling the image
like a passport picture. The pictures must be no bigger
than 100kb and saved as a .jpeg or .tif ﬁle. We will use
them in order of arrival if we get too many, and if we
get too few, we will assume the worst for the future of
our subject.
Statement of permission: “I (your name) grant permis-
sion to reproduce this photograph worldwide as part of
the cover image of TREE and in all revisions and trans-
lations of the cover image in print and in all the forms of
media, now or hereafter known (including books, jour-
nals, CD-ROMs, online and internet), derivative works
based on this journal, and other publications or adver-
tising material published by Elsevier.”

Tree Rot
I answered a query concerning decay indices for phylo-
genetic trees directly, but thought the information may
be useful for other members of the group.
TreeRot by Sorenson http://people.bu.edu/msoren/-
TreeRot.html is a very easy program to use for deter-
mining Bremer indices (decay indices). It is also capa-
ble of providing partitioned DI, and after your analysis
is complete, the program can parse your output log and
give you the DI at each node (so you don’t have to go
through the log ﬁle yourself and do the arithmatic).

Question: Does anybody know of a freely available pro-
gram that converts fasta / nexus / mega / phylip etc.
ﬁles to the *.rdf ﬁles used by the NETWORK program
Answer: Seems everybody use dnasp. Its free; http:/-
/www.ub.es/dnasp/ I tested it and it works. Import
your fasta (or whatever) ﬁle to dnasp and the export it
to the Roehl format.
But even easier. You can use Network as it is if you do
it correctly:
You do not need to convert a ﬁle to the *.rdf format.
Just go directly to the “Calculate Network: Network
Calculations: Median Joining” menu (if that’s the type
of analysis you want to perform). That will open a new
window. After that, you can go to the “File: Open”
menu, which will open a conventional Windows ﬁle di-
alog box. From there, just select the type of ﬁle you
want to open using the drop-down menu at the bot-
tom of the dialog box. You should see a list of diﬀerent
types of ﬁles that can be directly read by the program
(including nexus and phylip ﬁles).
Thanks for all the Answers All the best Carina

Marie Curie Research training network (MRTN) SEX-
ASEX - postdoctoral position available in molecular ge-
netics
Researchers interested in the paradox of sex in evolu-
tionary biology are strongly encouraged to apply for a
research position in the European Union Marie Curie
Research Training Network SEXASEX, which is co-
ordinated by Prof. Dr. Koen Martens, RBINSc, Brus-
sels. One postdoctoral (’Experienced Researcher’) po-
sition is vacant, out of a total of 10 positions supported
by the network. Criteria of eligibility include: EU cit-
izenship, less than 10 years of research experience (de-
ﬁned as starting when the candidate is awarded a de-
gree that permits entry to a PhD programme, usually
a Masters degree), and a willingness to work in a Eu-
ropean country other than the country of origin. We
seek candidates who are enthusiastic about evolution-
ary biology, travelling and living abroad, learning in a
multidisciplinary research environment and working in
teams. This appointment will be for 2 years but we
may consider making two one-year appointments for
suitable candidates.
The application of female candidates is especially en-
couraged; detailed information on child care facilities
at the diﬀerent institutions will be provided upon re-
quest. Aid can be sought if accompanying spouses also
require employment abroad.
Project overview: Sex is the queen of evolutionary
problems. It will be tackled by SEXASEX in a mul-
tidisciplinary approach, providing training and trans-
fer of knowledge for a total of 360 person-months. 10
network researchers (6 young researchers (YR) and 4
experienced researchers (ER)) will receive training in
9 institutions across as many countries. A wide ar-
ray of research tools will provide excellent training op-
portunities, for example through individual career de-velopment plans, individual tutoring and secondments,
which will be supplemented by participation in courses
and external workshops. Network-wide training will ex-
ploit the extensive experience of the partner institutions
through ﬁve courses and summer schools for all network
researchers. Complementary skills such as management
and communication (verbal, written) will be developed,
and gender awareness will be raised, in two network-
wide meetings. The network’s theoretical and empir-
ical research will apply 13 major approaches, includ-
ing novel genetic and cytogenetic approaches, intraspe-
ciﬁc phylogeography, ecology, behavioural studies, GIS
analyses and theoretical modelling. With this mul-
tidisciplinary toolkit, SEXASEX will investigate why
sex exists at all, given its evolutionary costs, using the
model organism Eucypris virens, a non-marine ostra-
cod species with both sexual and asexual reproduction.
What determines its gender, what are the genomic con-
sequences of long-term asexuality, what is the cohesive-
ness of a species with mixed reproduction, how do asex-
uals and sexuals compete and what is their historical
zoogeography? The pluralistic approach of SEXASEX
is unique and timely, using highly novel methodologies
and dealing with cutting edge science based on Euro-
pean excellence and tradition. Please refer to http://-
www.naturalsciences.be/EVIRENS/ for more informa-
tion.
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION: MOLECULAR GE-
NETIC AND CYTOGENETIC APPROACHES TO
THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF ASEX-
UAL REPRODUCTION. Starting date: 1st July 2006
or as soon as possible thereafter Duration: 24 months
(or 2 x 12 months) Salary: country-speciﬁc plus tax-
free mobility allowance Scientists in charge: Prof. Dr
Jan Zima, Czech Republic
Prof. Dr Roger Butlin, UK Locations: Brno, Czech
Republic & Sheﬃeld, UK (12 months funded in each
location but the ﬁnal arrangements are open to nego-
tiation with the appointee). Visits to other partner
laboratories will be encouraged and may be required,
especially for cytogenetic training in Munich. Places of
work: 1) Academy of Science, Institute of Vertebrate
Biology & Charles University, Department of Zoology;66 EvolDir April 1, 2006
2) University of Sheﬃeld, Department of Animal and
Plant Sciences
Approach and methods to be applied: Sex determi-
nation mechanisms in freshwater ostracods in general
and in E. virens in particular remain elusive: are they
chromosome based (XY or XO systems) or environmen-
tally cued, or are other factors at play? What genetic
changes underlie the transition to asexual reproduction
and what changes accumulate as a result of long term
asexuality? We will investigate these questions with a
range of modern genetic and cytogenetic approaches.
Correlations between chromosomal architecture and/or
other cytological factors and reproductive mode will be
examined, using ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization tech-
niques. Gene expression will be examined with Sup-
pression Subtractive Hybridisation (SSH). This will be
used to search for genes that are expressed diﬀerently
in sexual females

BrownU SpliceSiteRecognition
Postdoctoral Associate
My lab employs computational approaches to identify
and understand the role of individual sequence elements
in complex recognition events. In yeast, splice sites
are deﬁned by strong consensus sequences. Yet in ver-
tebrate genes these signals appear much weaker even
though the search space is much larger (bigger genomes,
bigger pre-mRNAs, more introns). The information
necessary for recognition appears to have migrated out-
side the sites and into the surrounding sequences. We
have identiﬁed subtle enhancer and silencer sequences
that appear to help explain this recognition event.
we want to: 1) identify functional variants using these
models and inferences of selection. 2) test the enhancer
activity of both version of the alleles in a high- through-
put system 3) implement computational methods in
multiple genomes to study the evolutionary history of
these elements - concomitant loss/gain of cis-element
and trans acting factor
I am looking for a postdoc with quality molecu-
lar biology experience coming from an evolution-
ary/computational background. Salary will be com-
mensurate with experience but will deﬁnitely start
higher than the institutional minimum (28K) . There
may also be some opportunity to transition into a
CCMB teaching fellow next year if that is something
that is interesting to you.April 1, 2006 EvolDir 67

Hello,
I have a 2 year post doctoral position beginning in April
2006 to develop high throughput and automated ﬂow
cytometric methods to analyze leaf and seed tissue from
both experimental and crop plants.
The position will involve a number of diﬀerent projects,
both in my research group and in conjunction with Eu-
ropean seed companies, and will include (to name but
a few):
1. Seed analyses of sexual and apomictic plants (my
group) 2. Somatic tissue analyses of induced polyploids
3. Genome size analyses of wild accessions from various
crop plants
The work will involve analyses using automated pipet-
ting and ﬂow cytometric systems which have been re-
cently purchased for my lab, and will entail develop-
ment of extraction methods, buﬀer systems, and down-
stream automated software analyses. I’m thus looking
for someone who is very comfortable with computers,
and who has experience with ﬂow cytometry and kary-
ological methods. There is also the possibility of joining
these analyses with a number of genotyping projects we
have running.
My group is at the IPK in Gatersleben, which is about
2 hours southwest of Berlin in the foothills of the beau-
tiful Harz Mountains. The IPK is a very well endowed
institute with a wide range of research groups working
on both model systems (Arabidopsis) and crop plants.
Knowledge of German would be helpful, but is not re-
quired.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions, or require more information.

of who have completed their doctorate in the past year.
Rubicon programme of the Dutch Science Foundation
The Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) has recently
established a new programme (called Rubicon) that
intends to further the mobility of talented young re-
searches who have just completed their doctorate.
Rubicon oﬀers Dutch researchers the opportunity to
gain experience at a top research institute outside the
Netherlands, and it oﬀers talented researchers from
abroad the opportunity to obtain a one-year grant for
conducting research at a top research institute in the
Netherlands. For example, talented young researchers
in the ﬁelds of ecology and evolution might take this
opportunity to spend a year at the Centre for Ecologi-
cal and Evolutionary Studies (CEES) at the University
of Groningen.
The Rubicon programme is highly attractive and, as a
consequence, highly competitive. There are three selec-
tion rounds a year. The next deadline for submitting
an application is 18 April 2006. For more information

Utah EvolMammalianDetoxGenes
Post Doctoral Research Associate in the area of plant-
mammal interactions: evolution of mammalian detoxi-
ﬁcation genes. Speciﬁcally, this project involves inves-
tigation into the recent evolution of creosote feeding by
the desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida). Within the past
10,000 yrs, the desert woodrat has evolved the capabil-
ity to deal with the large quantities of toxic resin in-
gested while foraging on creosote leaves. This capacity
for resin tolerance diﬀers among desert woodrat popu-
lations such that populations with evolutionary experi-
ence with creosote voluntarily ingest greater quantities
of creosote. Furthermore3experienced2populations
have higher enzyme activities, particularly cytochrome
p4502B. The central goal of this project is to under-
stand the evolution of woodrat detoxiﬁcation enzymes,
particularly CYP2B, with respect to creosote feeding.
Qualiﬁcations: Candidates should have experience with
molecular evolution approaches techniques and analy-
ses. Strong writing skills are essential. Prior experi-
ence trapping and handling small mammals preferred
but candidates enthusiastic to learn will be considered.
To apply, send a cover letter detailing your interest
and suitability for the position, CV, 1-2 page research
statement, representative reprints, names and email ad-
dresses of at least three references to Dr. Denise Dear-

EMBO practical course: Statistical methods for identi-
ﬁcation of genes under natural selection
Helsinki 15th-19th May 2006
Organizers: J. Corander & C. Schl¨ otterer
The identiﬁcation of genes subjected to natural selec-
tion has been one of the primary research interests in
population genetics over the past decades. With the
recent technological advancements and the availabil-
ity of numerous fully sequenced genomes, the empha-
sis is shifting from the analysis of single genes towards
genome scans for genes subjected to selection.
The course aims to train biologists with the fundamen-
tal techniques on how to use statistical methods for the
identiﬁcation of selected genes. Furthermore, we will
also show how the statistical tests could be improved by
the incorporation of available data from genome scans.
Participants of the course will be provided with the
background of the statistical tests, they will be trained
in the use of available statistical software packages, and
ﬁnally they will have the opportunity to apply this
knowledge to their own data.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
