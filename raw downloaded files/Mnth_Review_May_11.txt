recombcg.org THEME AND SCOPE
The continuing advance of DNA sequencing technol-
ogy has produced an avalanche of genome sequence
and genome structural information across the evolu-
tionary spectrum. Transforming that information into
biological knowledge requires creative and innovative
new computational and statistical methods for compar-
ative genomics.
The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Ge-
nomics aims to provide the premier forum for new com-
putational developments applied to all aspects of com-
parative genomics. We solicit contributions on topics
including comparison of genome structure and organi-
zation, genome function, and evolution. We particu-
larly encourage contributions that use new computa-
tional methods to acquire new insight into biological
processes. Advances in computational theory are wel-
come, though all submissions should include genome-
scale analyses informed by comparative data.
New for 2011, all peer-reviewed and accepted
RECOMB-CG manuscripts will be published in a sup-
plement to BMC Bioinformatics as open access, author
subsidized, articles.
Speciﬁc topics of interest include but are not limited
to:
Gene and genome duplication Gene family evolu-
tion Genome structural variation Algorithms for com-
parative genomics Genome rearrangement Ancestral
genome reconstruction Multiple genome alignment
Genome sequence comparison Modeling genome evo-
lution Comparative genomics for genome annotation
Gene tree reconciliation Species and gene tree in-
ference Comparative metagenomics Comparative ge-
nomics linked to proteomics, metabolomics, and other
’omic data Comparative genomics and gene expressionand regulation Applications of comparative genomic
methods

This year’s theme, Genomics and Biodiversity, recog-
nizes the remarkable new Laboratoria Nacional Ge-
nomica para la Biodiversidad (LANGEBIO, http://-
www.langebio.cinvestav.mx/ ), the National Laboratory
of Genomics for Biodiversity, located in Irapuato, Gua-
najuato, Mexico. The Laboratory’s mission is “to bring
together interdisciplinary groups to carry out cutting-
edge research and to generate genetic knowledge about
Mexican biodiversity.” The meeting also recognizes
that Mexico is ranked 5th in the world in terms of bio-
diversity, leading all other countries in, for example, thenumber of reptiles, pines and cacti. What better place
to celebrate the role of genomics in generating knowl-
edge of biodiversity than the National Laboratory of
Genomics?

Our opening evening reception takes place July 23.
On the 24th, we will have a day-long symposium at
LANGEBIO where attendees can meet the scientists
and see the remarkable research facility. The talks on
July 25th and half-day July 26th will be held in the
wondrous Spanish colonial town of Guanajuato (about
40 km from Irapuato), a World Heritage site with am-
ple accommodation and restaurants. Attendees can ﬂy
into Leon (about three hours north of Mexico City by
car) and stay in Guanajuato. The meeting will end
with a banquet at the historic Mision Guanajuato on
the evening of the 26th and a day-long ﬁeld trip on the
27th to survey biodiversity in the area and the equally
stunning city of San Miguel de Allende. We hope to see
you there!

national Tunicate Meeting, July 3-7 2011 in Montreal,
Canada
Dear tunicate (and chordate/deuterostome) biologists:
The registration page of the 6th International Tunicate
Meeting website http://apps.mni.mcgill.ca/tunicate/ is
now open.
The ITM is the principal scientiﬁc gathering of tu-
nicate researchers, and is an organic outgrowth of
this wide-spread and diverse, but very collegial, sci-
entiﬁc community. It is a regular biennial meeting
of~150-200 researchers from around the world, orga-
nized as a scientiﬁc conference with research presenta-
tions given in plenary sessions and poster sessions. The
6th International Tunicate Meeting (ITM) will be held
July 3-7 2011 at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec,
Canada. Previous meetings were in Okinawa, Japan
(2009), Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, (2007) Santa Bar-
bara, California (2005), Marseille, France, (2003) and,
in 2000, the inaugural ITM was held on main-island
Japan.
The ITMs cover all aspects of tunicate research
including, but not limited to, (alphabetically
listed) developmental biology (including embryo-
genesis, metamorphosis, budding and regener-May 1, 2011 EvolDir 13
ation), ecology and population diversity, evo-
lution (tunicates/chordates/deuterostomes), ge-
nomics/proteomics, immunity and allo-recognition,
invasive species, neurobiology, physiology and system-
atics. These will all be featured in the 6th ITM in
Montreal, including invasive species biology, reﬂecting
the importance of tunicates as problematic invasive
species in Canada and elsewhere. Plenary session talks
are selected from submitted abstracts.
Abstracts may be submitted until April 30, a
registration+lodging package will be available until
May 31, and registration will be open until June 30.
The 6th ITM takes place in Montreal during its sum-
mer festival season and overlaps with the International
Jazz Festival, Cirque du Soleil performances in the Old
Port, and the Juste Pour Rire comedy festival.
We hope to see you in Montreal this summer!

Norman iEvoBio Metagenomics
Jun21-22
Special Session on Metagenomics, Barcoding, and Bio-
diversity at iEvoBio (Informatics for Phyogenetics,
Evolution, and Biodiversity)
This year, iEvoBio will have a special focus Session
on Metagenomics, Barcoding, and Biodiversity and
the challenges that these new approaches raise for
evolutionary informatics. We now have over 6000
genomes and vast quantities of metagenomic sequences
in the public domain, primarily from bacteria and ar-
chaea from many habitats. Various short sequences
(e.g. barcodes) for quick identiﬁcation of eukaryotes
are emerging. The availability of this sequence data
and ever-cheaper methods for producing it oﬀer excit-
ing opportunities for understanding molecular evolu-
tion and biodiversity. However, the data are growing
faster than the infrastructure to support it. More-
over, the eukaryotic and microbial informatics com-
munities have independent histories and approaches,
so synergy is not easy. These challenges typify the
intersection of ﬁelds that are the scope of iEvoBio.
Invited speakers in this special session include Neil
Davies ( http://moorea.berkeley.edu/aboutus/people/-
ndavies ) from the Moorea Biocode project, Linda
Amarral-Zettler ( http://amarallab.mbl.edu/ ) from the
Marine Biological Laboratory Wood’s Hole, and Holly
Bik, from the Hubbard Center for Genome Stud-
ies at the University of New Hampshire. After the
talks, there will be an open panel with all the speak-
ers, including keynote speaker Dawn Field ( http:/-

Ecology and Hydrology at Oxford.

tributing content are available at http://ievobio.org .

to be considered for presentation at this special session
of PSB. Papers will be published in the peer-reviewed
proceedings and indexed in Medline.
The objective of this Microbiome Studies special ses-
sion is to expand our understanding of the composi-
tion, structure, and function of microbial ecosystems
and their impact on human health and well-being. We
particularly encourage studies that apply “next gen-
eration” sequencing technologies, and reports of tools
that support the analysis and sharing of data from such
studies. Problems of speciﬁc interest may include, but
are not limited to:
Algorithm, statistical, software, and database develop-
ment for analyzing data from shotgun metagenomics,
16S hypervariable region surveys, and microbial tran-
scriptomics.
Association studies of microbial consortia with human
health, agriculture, bioremediation, climate change,
and engineering.
Theoretical and simulation studies of microbial ecol-
ogy, function, and evolution.
The role of microbial consortia in natural ecosystems.
Interactions among diﬀerent microbial systems and
macrobiological systems
Other topics within the subject area are welcome. Note
that all submitted papers should make clear their rel-
evance for the study of Microbiome Studies. If unsure
whether your paper ﬁts the session theme, please con-
tact one of the co-chairs.

The themes of the meeting range from pure to applied
topics, regarding both inland-water and marine taxa;
six main sessions are scheduled:
Session 1 - New needs, Old tools: how taxonomy
can help in monitoring the present-day biodiversity
changes. Session 2 - How much diversity in Amphipoda
(morphotypes, ecotypes, trophic categories). Session 3
- Novel interactive tools recently developed and based
on morphological characters. Session 4 - Novel inter-
active tools recently developed and based on molecu-
lar characters. Session 5 - Examples of the use of the
taxon Amphipoda in environmental monitoring. Ses-
sion 6 - How decline in popularity of traditional tax-
onomy could impact on biology and society and which
agencies support taxonomic research.
We are looking forward to meet you in Palermo!

Conference on Eﬀects of Genome Structure & Sequence
on the Generation of Variation and Evolution DIMACS,
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ
August 9 ˆ a 11, 2011
CALL FOR POSTERS
A special invitation for Graduate Student & Postdocs
About the Topic:
The structure of DNA is not monotonous, but
rather varies along its sequence, sometimes dramat-
ically so. Such variation in structure leads to se-
quenceˆ adependent variations in the ﬁdelity of DNA
copying and repair.
That the probability of distinct classes of mutations
varies along a DNA sequence has implications for evolu-
tionary theory because selection acts on heritable vari-
ation when this variation aﬀects ﬁtness.
Highly mutable sequences have, in fact, evolved in
genome regions such as those encoding pathogen coats
where increased diversity in a population favors sur-
vival.
The goal of this conference is to inspire a dialogueamong evolutionary biologists and broad interdisci-
plinary group of researchers to explore the impact of
our increase understanding of DNA structure, repair,
replication and organization on evolutionary theory.

FishSpeciation
PhD Studentship
Ecological Genomics and Speciation in Annual Fish
Annual killiﬁsh (Cynolebiasines) have undergone an ex-
traordinary evolutionary radiation in the ponds (’tem-
porary islands’) of South America. There are over 30
species in the genus Austrolebias alone, which vary
tremendously in size, colour, diet and other ecologi-
cal adaptations (e.g. small crustivores vs. large pisci-
vores). These ﬁsh are a remarkably good system for
ecological and evolutionary studies. They can be easily
grown in the lab, grow very fast (about three months to
maturity) and die soon (they are annuals). They have
interesting embryonic diapauses, and their eggs can be
stored dried for months. So, there is no other verte-
brate that is even remotely as amenable to the study
of life-history genetics as these ﬁsh.
The student will look at a few species pairs of kil-
liﬁsh, chosen for their contrasting traits of interest,
i.e. those potentially linked to speciation scenarios
and ecological adaptation. Experiments, hybridization
and next-generation genomic tools will be applied (e.g.
genomic and transcriptomic scans, candidate loci, ex-
pression analyses) to identify potential loci underlying
these traits. This will be the basis for disentangling the
molecular basis of life-history variation and speciation.
The project will be based in Savolainen Lab
at Imperial College at Silwood Park (savolainen-
lab.org), co-supervised by Prof. Armand Leroi
(www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.leroi) and Dr Tom Van
Dooren (Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris; tomvan-

Hello All,
I have a graduate research assistantship (GRA) avail-
able for a M.S. or Ph.D. student to work in my evolu-
tionary genetics laboratory. Our speciﬁc interests lie in
identifying the genes and proteins that underlie post-
mating, prezygotic reproductive isolation in a complex
of crickets that are only isolated by such phenotypes.
We use a wide range of proteomic, molecular, behav-
ioral and physiological analyses to identify and func-
tionally test candidate genes (see my lab website for
more information www.k-state.edu/cricketlab ).
If you are interested in applying, please contact me by
e-mail (cricket@ksu.edu) and I will forward you the nec-
essary materials. Also, I am happy to oﬀer more infor-
mation or answer any questions you may have.

PhD position - Visualizing Human Ancestry using Ge-
nomic Data
The DNA sequencing revolution has led to the pro-
duction of an unprecedented quantity of data on hu-
man ancestry and promises the advent of “personal ge-
nomics”. We are looking for an individual with a strong
quantitative training and perhaps a dash of visual ﬂair
to develop statistical tools that represent relationships
between individuals and populations based on genetic
data. The goal is to provide historically and demo-
graphically informative summaries that reﬂect the mo-
saic nature of human ancestry as well as diﬀerences
amongst groups. Applications include medical genet-
ics, studies of human population history, comparative
demography and science communication.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropol-
ogy in Leipzig represents a unique environment for this
research. As well as sequencing the genome of Neander-
tals and other ancient hominids, a variety of projects
seek to characterize diversity in human and ape pop-
ulations. See http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/ . This
project is part of an ongoing a collaboration between
Daniel Falush and Simon Myers (University of Oxford
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/˜myers/ ) to develop statis-
tical genetic methods for ancestry reconstruction.
Talented and enthusiastic candidates with a degree
in any strongly quantitative discipline (e.g. Maths,
Physics,
Computer Science) will be considered. Particularly ad-
vantageous would be a knowledge of Markov chains,
modern computationally intensive statistical methods,
etc. Good programming ability is a major plus as is
involvement in informatics projects with a visual com-
ponent. Knowledge of evolutionary biology or popula-
tion genetics would be advantageous but is not required.
Please contact daniel falush@eva.mpg.de to apply and
for further information.

Cox Institute of Molecular BioSciences, Massey Univer-
sity, New Zealand
A PhD scholarship is now open for a highly motivated
and productive student in the Computational Biology
Research Group at Massey University, New Zealand.
The successful candidate will study how human social
arrangements, such as marriage practices, aﬀect pat-
terns of genetic diversity in small communities. Al-
though there is scope to accommodate existing research
interests, the successful candidate will develop, imple-
ment and test new methods in statistical genetics, and
apply these methods to genetic and cultural anthropol-
ogy datasets. This research will initially be directed to-
ward determining whether human social practices have
constrained or directed genetic evolution in the Paciﬁc
region, a major focus of my research group.
This PhD scholarship oﬀers a rare opportunity to de-
velop your skills as a researcher within an internation-
ally recognized computational biology research group,
while taking advantage of New Zealand’s unique nat-
ural and cultural environment. Palmerston North, a

city is located close to the North Island’s central moun-
tains, and presents regular opportunities for hiking, ski-
ing, surﬁng and adventure sports, as well as experienc-
ing New Zealand’s unique indigenous culture. Never-
theless, my research group maintains extensive interna-
tional connections, especially with colleagues in Aus-
tralia, Indonesia, France and the United States, and is
linked ﬁrmly into the international scientiﬁc commu-
nity.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: - A Masters or Hon-
ors degree (First Class or equivalent) in computational
biology, bioinformatics, applied mathematics, computer
science, population genetics, molecular evolution, or
other relevant ﬁeld. - Able to conduct independent
cutting-edge research. - Solid analytical, quantitative
and mathematical skills. - Experience with proba-
bilistic modeling and statistical genetics. - Candidates
should be comfortable working in a UNIX environment,

Project 1
Life history inﬂuences on range expansion and popula-
tion connectivity in a widely distributed marine sponge
Supervisor: Nicole de Voogd
(Nicole.devoogd@ncbnaturalis.nl)
Population connectivity is a topic of major interest in
marine biology with implications for ecology, evolution-
ary biology, biogeography, conservation and the man-
agement of exploited resources. In general, species with
a longer pelagic larval duration, will disperse greater
distances. Realised dispersal, however, depends on a
number of factors including larval life history traits,
behaviour and oceanographic conditions, particularly
current patterns. Vertical migration behavior can have
an important impact on horizontal dispersal, by regu-
lating the time spent by larvae within particular layers
of vertically sheared ﬂows. Temporal variation in cur-
rent patterns is in turn strongly aﬀected by winds, den-
sity stratiﬁcation of the water column and instabilities
caused by interaction of currents with bottom topogra-
phy. The overall objective of the present research pro-
posal will address (in part) this conceptual framework
by examining questions related to species performance
(reproductive output) population (genetic) structure,
and larval dispersal over wide biogeographical scales by
using a widely distributed and conspicuous coral reef
giant barrel sponge (Xestospongia testudinaria) as a
model. Giant barrel sponges are the largest and pos-
sibly longest living of sponges and are also important
spatial competitors in reef environments and contribute
to reef heterogeneity. This study will be one of the ﬁrst
detailed studies of connectivity in a tropical sponge. In
particular we will:
1) Quantify reproductive output of X. testudinaria
across wide latitudinal gradients from Indonesia to the
central Great Barrier Reef.24 EvolDir May 1, 2011
2) Elucidate how populations are genetically connected
over spatial scales that range from within reefs (me-
tres) among reefs (kilometers) and between bio-regions
(100-1000s of kms)
3) Establish the inﬂuence of larval dispersal and settle-
ment on population maintenance and

StockholmU ancientDNA
STOCKHOLM UNIVERSITY announces a
PhD POSITION IN SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLU-
TION (ANCIENT DNA) at the Department of Zo-
ology, Stockholm University (placed at the Molecular
Systematics Laboratory, the Swedish Museum of Nat-
ural History).
Project title: Large carnivore population turnover and
ecological change during the Late Quaternary
Final date for applications: May 2, 2011
Project description:
The aim of this PhD project is to investigate the ex-
tent and timing of large carnivore demographic and eco-
logical change during the last Ice Age as well as more
recent historical times. As a secondary objective, the
project also aims to assess the relative contribution of
humans and climate change on these demographic and
ecological changes. The laboratory analyses will com-
prise ancient DNA technology, radiocarbon dating and
analysis of stable isotopes on fossils up to 50 000 years
old. Speciﬁc questions that will be addressed include i)
the eﬀect of climatic changes during the last glaciation,
ii) the existence and contribution of cryptic and tradi-
tional refugia, iii) the impact of the arrival of anatom-
ically modern humans in diﬀerent regions, iv) the con-
sequences of the rise of human societies and changes
to agricultural landscapes during the Holocene, and v)
the impact of anthropogenic hunting during the last
two centuries. From a conservation perspective, the
long-term goal of the project is to develop a better un-
derstanding of how climate change and anthropogenic
pressure, and the interaction between them, will aﬀect
large carnivores in the future. The project will be donewithin the ancient DNA research group at the Depart-
ment of Molecular Systematics, the Swedish Museum
of Natural History. The PhD degree will be awarded
in Systematics and Evolution at the Department of Zo-
ology, Stockholm University. Dr. Love Dal´ en at the

StockholmU EvoDevo
PHD POSITION: “ADAPTIVE DEVELOPMENTAL
PLASTICITY AND GENETIC POLYMORPHISM IN
INSECTS IN VARIED ENVIRONMENTS”
The position is available in Ethology at the Department
of Zoology, Stockholm University, with a May 2, 2011
application deadline.
The general research area of the project is theoretical
evolutionary biology and evolutionary ecology. Speciﬁ-
cally, the aim is to develop and test theoretical models
of the evolution of phenotypic variation as a response
to varied environments. Important phenotypes for in-
sect adaptations to varied environments include habi-
tat and host plant preference, dispersal capacity and
tendency, and traits important for life-cycle regulation,
such as diapause and voltinism. A major question for
the project is whether phenotypic variation is expected
to be a plastic response to environmental inﬂuences
or, instead, a consequence of genetic variation. The
methodology used will be adaptive dynamics modeling,
combined with individual-based and population genetic
computer simulations. The project can also include
collaboration with empiricists examining variation in
traits related to host plant choice and life-cycle regula-
tion in butterﬂies, within the Strategic Research Pro-
gram EkoKlim at Stockholm University.
The requirements are an MSc or similar degree in evo-lutionary biology, evolutionary ecology or related dis-
ciplines, including at least 80 weeks of biology studies,
with a degree project, in a ﬁeld related to the research
area, of at least 20 weeks at advanced level. Appli-
cants who have acquired corresponding competence in
Sweden or abroad are also qualiﬁed. Applicants will
be assessed based on their documented knowledge in
ﬁelds relevant to the research area, their creativity, in-
dependence and social competence, the quality of their
degree project thesis and other publications, and the
cover letter. Applicants with documented experience of
theoretical modeling in a ﬁeld related to evolutionary
biology will have an advantage in the selection process.
The application should include a one-page presentation
(cover letter) of yourself and why you want to undertake
a PhD within this project. The application should also
include your CV, a copy of the thesis of your degree
project, a copy of your diploma or degree certiﬁcate,
and names and contact details (phone and e-mail) of
two references. Please submit your application (stating
the Ref Nr 2/11 OL 2) by 2 May 2011 to: Stockholm

UDublin EvolutionaryBiology
PhD Studentship in Evolutionary Biology Characteri-
sation of lignin and cellulose formation genes in biomass
and energy grasses (Poaceae)
Principal Investigator: Dr Trevor Hodkinson
(University of Dublin, Trinity College, Ireland;
Trevor.Hodkinson@tcd.ie). Collaborators: Susanne
Barth (Teagasc), Nicolas Salamin (University of
Lausanne), Elizabeth Kellogg (University of Missouri).
Grasses have received considerable attention as a sourceof woody biomass for bioenergy production to pro-
vide alternatives to fossil fuels. Potential bioenergy
grasses include Miscanthus, maize, switchgrass and sev-
eral woody bamboos. Most grasses are herbaceous
but some subfamilies have evolved woodiness. Bam-
boos (subfamily Bambusoideae) have evolved a woody
character via enhancement of the lignocellulosic compo-
nent of vascular tissue, especially vessels. Reeds (e.g.
Arundo, Phragmites, subfamily Arundinoideae) and
Panicoideae (e.g. Saccharum, Miscanthus, Panicum)
have also evolved this trait. It is not known if they have
achieved this via alternative biosynthetic paths/genes.
Grass cell walls diﬀer from other angiosperms in their
major structural polysaccharides, pectins, proteins and
phenolic compounds. Recent advances in genomics
have revealed cellulose synthase$B! >(Blike (Csl) gene
families (unique to grasses) and the CslF gene (unique
to Poales, the order to which the grass family belongs).
An understanding of how these gene families and ligno-
cellulosic biosynthesis evolved in grasses is key to im-
proving the processing quality of grasses for bioenergy
and the manipulation of the genes in future biotechnol-
ogy and plant breeding. Objectives and methodology:
1) Investigate, via a candidate gene approach, the evo-
lution of genes known to be of importance for woodiness
in grasses (e.g. cellulose synthase genes, Cesl, a highly
expressed gene family in developing vascular ﬁbres, in-
cluding CslF, and monolignol biosynthesis genes. 2)
Investigate the eﬀects of woodiness on grass evolution
(e.g. investigate, using diversiﬁcation statistics and
molecular dating, whether woodiness was a signiﬁcant
key innovation for speciation in the groups that have
evolved it).
Applications are sought from suitably qualiﬁed candi-
dates to undertake doctoral research at the University
of Dublin, Trinity College ( www.tcd.ie ), under this
PRTLI-funded structured PhD programme. All appli-
cations must include the following documents in one

UGuelph MarineInvertBarcoding
University of Guelph (with West Coast DFO Research
Placement)We are seeking an enthusiastic Ph.D. student with an
interest in applied evolutionary genetics and taxonomy
to conduct a DNA barcoding study on marine inver-
tebrates as part of a large multi-disciplinary network
conducting studies on aquatic invasive species. This
barcoding project is a collaborative one, involving re-
searchers at the University of Guelph, Fisheries and
Oceans Canada, and University of Windsor.
Many global invaders are marine invertebrates such as
crustaceans, molluscs, and ascidians that often present
taxonomic challenges, especially in early life history
stages. DNA barcoding has been identiﬁed as a robust,
widely applicable method that could serve as an inter-
national standard for the identiﬁcation of aquatic inva-
sive species on a global scale as it has practical advan-
tages over classical taxonomic methods. However, its
utility for this purpose needs to be validated-especially
when invaders and co-occurring native species are very
similar-and its usefulness is a function of the availability
of validated DNA barcoding datasets.
The successful candidate will apply DNA barcoding
methods to generate essential baseline data on inverte-
brate biodiversity in Canada’s coastal waters and will
then evaluate the utility of this approach for invasive
species identiﬁcation and detection. This project may
also involve generating molecular phylogenies based
on multiple nuclear markers where needed to resolve
taxonomic uncertainties of important marine invaders.
Species identiﬁcations will be obtained in collaboration
with taxonomic experts, and the relationship between
cryptic species diversity and body size will be explored
using the resulting datasets.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate who
is interested in playing a substantial role in develop-
ing novel research directions for this project, using the
sequence data to address exciting questions in ecology
and/or evolution. Potential research topics include in-
vestigating the phylogenetic distribution of “invasive-
ness”; analyzing molecular evolutionary rates across
diﬀerent taxa; or comparing patterns of genetic diver-
sity, species diversity, species complementarity, and in-
vasive species prevalence among regions.
The student will be co-advised by Dr. Sarah Adamow-
icz (University of Guelph), Dr. Cathryn Abbott, and
Dr. Thomas Therriault (both of the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans Canada). The successful candi-
date will be based at the Paciﬁc Biological Station in
Nanaimo, B.C. for a portion of the studentship. This
position provides the opportunity to conduct novel re-
search in invasion biology, ecology, and evolution and
will serve as an outstanding training ground for those
interested in governmental, academic, or private-sector28 EvolDir May 1, 2011

REVEALING THE ROUTES TO BIODIVERSITYMay 1, 2011 EvolDir 29
This studentship will aim to understand the origin and
evolution of wide-scale patterns of diversity in animals.
It is currently not clear how environmental factors in-
teract with speciation, extinction, and genetic and mor-
phological rates of change to produce diversity. It is
often assumed that these diﬀerent measures of diver-
sity are closely tied; for example, where there are more
species we would expect greater morphological diver-
sity. There is a growing literature that suggests this
is not the case: reproductive isolations can occur with
little or no genetic change; genetically very closely re-
lated species can have wildly divergent morphologies;
some large groups of species can be indistinguishable
from gross morphology where as other, species-poor,
groups are diverse. If this is the case how does diver-
sity accumulate? The student will address this question
using cutting-edge statistical phylogenetic comparative
methods applied to multiple datasets encompassing a
wide range of animal groups. The studentship has the
potential to contribute to a real quantitative science
of macroevolution and has implications for life history,
ecology, evolutionary biology, conservation and popu-
lation biology. Potential applicants are encouraged to
contact Dr Chris Venditti (C.Venditti@hull.ac.uk) be-
fore submitting an application.

DEALING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE:
DOES EARLY EXPERIENCE ALLOW ANIMALS
TO ADAPT? Supervisors: Dr Lesley Morrell (Hull),
Dr Domino Joyce (Hull), Dr Ben Chapman (Lund)
One of the fundamental challenges in biology is to un-
derstand how animals respond to the unprecedented en-
vironmental changes caused by human activities. An-
imals adapt to environmental changes over evolution-
ary time, but we have only limited understanding of
how individuals can adapt to human-induced change
within their own lifespan. Fish are critical components
of aquatic food webs and habitats, which are frequently
subjected to signiﬁcant adverse anthropogenic impacts.
Fish are particularly vulnerable to changes aﬀecting
their sensory capabilities, such as increased turbidity
and chemical pollution from agricultural and industrial
sources. They rely on vision and olfaction in ﬁnding
food, choosing mates and detecting predators, all of
which are negatively impacted by loss of visual or ol-
factory information. Exposure to an altered environ-
ment during early life, however, may provide a mecha-
nism by which animals can compensate for the eﬀects of
the change in adulthood, through plastic or learned re-
sponses. This project will investigate behavioural adap-
tations to environmental change within an individual1s
own lifespan, using guppies as a model system.
We are looking for a highly motivated, dynamic and
enthusiastic individual, who will join the thriving Evo-
lutionary Biology group ( www.hull.ac.uk/evolution ).
The project beneﬁts from recent investment in exten-
sive aquaria facilities at Hull and the successful candi-
date will be trained in experimental design and statis-
tical analysis, behavioural observations and (depend-
ing on interests) simulation modelling and/or molecu-

PhD position: “Phenotypic plasticity and evolution of
life history traits in Tetrahymena thermophila micro-
cosms”
Biodiversity Research Centre Earth and Life Institute
Universit´ e catholique de Louvain (UCL) Louvain-la-
Neuve, Belgium www.uclouvain.be/en-bdiv A PhD po-
sition is available at our Biodiversity Research Centre.
Focus will be on the evolution of life styles by means
of artiﬁcial selection performed in lab-controlled micro-
cosms of the unicellular eukaryotic ciliate Tetrahymena
thermophila. The PhD-project is organized within the
framework of a larger collaborative 5-year research pro-
gram by a local consortium of three collaborating re-
search groups, including faculty (Profs. Hans Van
Dyck, Nicolas Schtickzelle and Caroline Nieberding),
postdocs and PhD students. That program is enti-
tled: “Integrating Evolution into Ecological Responses:
Changing Life Styles of Organisms in Changing Envi-
ronments”. The overall aim is a better understanding of
the role and mechanisms of plasticity for present and fu-
ture adaptation and survival in changing environments
in a series of model organisms (Pararge aegeria & Bicy-
clus anynana butterﬂies, Tetranychus urticae mite, and
Tetrahymena thermophila ciliate). Diﬀerent ﬁelds will
be combined in this program including behaviour, life
history, thermal ecology, genetics and genomics. Also
the relevance for conservation biology will be explored.
Within this program, this particular PhD project will
focus on experimental work with Tetrahymena ther-
mophila microcosms as a model system to study the
ecological consequences of changing environment in an
experimental ecology and conservation biology frame-
work. We maintain a series of clonal strains, each show-
ing distinctive life styles, i.e. sets of life history traits
(e.g. dispersal, kin cooperation, demography). The
work will use GxE experiments to quantify the slope
and range of variation of plasticity of these strains forvarious life history traits under diﬀerent environments
(temperature, habitat quality, O2 availability...). Then
we will study the functional signiﬁcance of plasticity in
terms of adaptation and adaptability through a set of
experimental evolution experiments. The PhD candi-
date will have the opportunity to develop her/his own
PhD research programme within the global project, in
close relation with postdocs and other PhD students,
and under full supervision of Nicolas Schtickzelle (+
possible co-supervision of Hans Van Dyck or Caroline
Nieberding according to the subject). She/he will also
beneﬁt from collaborations with the team of Drs Jean
Clobert and Alexis Chaine (CNRS Moulis, France),
working on Tetrahymena microcosms in a close collab-
oration.
We are looking for a strongly motivated PhD candidate
with a background in the broad ﬁeld of Evolutionary
Biology and Ecology. We oﬀer now one year of funding
to start the PhD project, but the successful applicant
is expected to apply, with our full support, for a PhD
grant to extend funding for her/his position to 4 years,
the average time to complete a PhD dissertation in Bel-
gium. Previous history showed that our students had a
very high success rate in obtaining this extended grant;
however no formal 100% warranty can be given. Please
do not apply to this position if this does not ﬁt your
expectations.
Salary ranges between 1500-1700 euros netto per month
plus beneﬁts (health insurance,.) which are included
in the Belgian system. Our University is an Equal
Opportunity/Aﬃrmative Action Employer, and is in a
French-speaking region, but the language for meetings
and scientiﬁc interactions is English. For background

UTasmania 2 ConservationGenetics
Scholarships (x2) for PhD conservation genetics studies
of Tasmanian fauna at the School of Zoology, University
of Tasmania
Project1: Conservation genetics of Tasmanian mam-
mals This project will focus on species of marsupials,
such as the Tasmanian bettong and eastern quoll, which34 EvolDir May 1, 2011
are now restricted to Tasmania, having gone extinct
on mainland Australia, and which may be threatened
by the recent invasion of the red fox. The project
will assess current genetic structure and gene ﬂow in
these species across Tasmania. These data will be
linked to dynamic species distribution models to iden-
tify high-priority populations that should be targeted
for long-term protection against potential fox impact.
The project would also use genetic methods to recon-
struct the demographic history of the Tasmanian pop-
ulations of these species, and this could include com-
parisons with lost genetic diversity from mainland pop-
ulations based on DNA extracted from museum speci-
mens. This project has the potential to make a major
contribution to the conservation of Australia’s biodi-
versity. Supervisors: Prof Chris Johnson and Dr Chris
Burridge (University of Tasmania).
Project2: Population genetics of related montane but-
terﬂy species This project will focus on two closely
related Tasmanian butterﬂy species that occupy high
elevations: Oreixenica ptunarra (threatened species)
and O. lathoniella. These species diﬀer in abun-
dance, range, and ﬂight capabilities. Populations of
O. ptunarra are often sympatric with the more abun-
dant and widespread O. lathionella, and hence this
study will contrast spatial genetic variation in the two
species using phylogeographic and population genetic
(microsatellite) analyses. The study will test hypothe-
ses that relate diﬀerences in patterns of spatial ge-
netic variation between the two species to diﬀerences
in ﬂight capabilities and habitat requirements. The
threatened species (O. ptunarra) is of particular con-
cern with respect to vegetation management (ﬁre and
grazing regimes), and this study will also investigate
the species’ ability to move between regions of suit-
able habitat as their location changes through time.
Supervisors: Dr Chris Burridge, Dr Peter McQuillan
(University of Tasmania) and Dr Phil Bell and Dr
Clare Hawkins (DPIPWE, Tasmania). Both projects
are based at the University of Tasmania ( http://-
www.utas.edu.au ), one of Australia’s oldest universi-
ties, with great opportunities for intellectual develop-
ment and also outdoor recreation. The Central Science
Laboratory contains a large, well-equipped molecular
genetics facility.
Applicants minimally require a BSc with a substantial
research component to part of their study (the latter
may have been achieved by diﬀerent means depending
on the country of study; within Australia this typically
represents a BSc Honours degree; externally, a MSc
degree would be the most common means of entry).
Demonstrated expertise with molecular laboratory pro-
cedures is desirable (DNA extraction, PCR, DNA se-quencing, microsatellite genotyping) but not essential,
as are interests and experience in conservation biology
and GIS.
Scholarship comprises $AUS 22,500 per year (3 years,
with a possible 6 month extension). Student fees will
be required if the you are not an Australian or New
Zealand citizen, or an Australian permanent resident
($AUS 19,376 per year, to be paid upfront each year),
unless you are able to attract your own scholarship, in
which case the fees will be waived. Please note that the
scholarship cannot be used to pay the fees (the schol-
arship is provided in weekly instalments, not upfront),
and applicants seeking to meet living costs or fee pay-
ments through additional employment simultaneously
with their studies are unlikely to be successful. Stu-
dents from a non-English speaking background will re-
quire proof of English-language ability (e.g. an IELTS
of 6.5).
To apply: Please send a cover letter expressing
your interest (in the form of an e-mail), contact
details of at least two referees, and an curricu-
lum vitae including details of undergraduate and any
(post)graduate performance to Dr. Chris Burridge
(chris.burridge@utas.edu.au ). Applications remain
open until the positions are ﬁlled.
Please note, I am away from my oﬃce until April 26th,
and may not be able to respond until after this date.

UZurich 2 SystematicBotany
Two PhD. positions in Systematic Botany / Phyloge-
netics at the University of Zurich
Project description: The selected Ph.D.
students will work with Dr. Colin
Hughes http://www.systbot.uzh.ch/Personen/-
ProfessorenundDozenten/ColinHughes.html on a
research project entitled ˆ aThe Biogeography and Evo-
lutionary Dynamics of Legume Diversiﬁcationˆ a, funded
by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation
(SNF) in the Institute of Systematic Botany at the
University of Z¨ urich. http://www.systbot.uzh.ch/-
index=5Fen.html The uneven distribution of species
richness across evolutionary lineages is one of the most
pervasive and fundamental features of biodiversity
across all organismal groups. The reasons why some
lineages diversify and others do not, why some clades
are species-rich and others are not, and the underlying
factors determining these diﬀerences, are crucial to
understanding how diversity evolves. One approach
to address these questions involves estimating rates
of species diversiﬁcation, assessing among-lineage
variation in diversiﬁcation rates, localising rate shifts
to particular branches on phylogenetic trees, and
examining potential ecological, geographical andadaptive life history correlates of diversiﬁcation. The
Biogeography and Evolutionary Dynamics of Legume
Diversiﬁcation Project aims to address these questions
using one of the largest and most evolutionarily suc-
cessful families of ﬂowering plants, the legumes. New
empirical data for two contrasting legume lineages, the
genus Lupinus and the subfamily Mimosoideae, will
be used to gain insights into diversiﬁcation patterns
across broad geographical and ecological spans, and
time frames. Key gaps in documentation of taxonomic
diversity in each group will be plugged to determine
the species richness of clades. Both study groups
include multiple continental-scale radiations oﬀering
novel opportunities to compare the diversiﬁcation
trajectories of multiple lineages simultaneously across
time and space. Research will involve ﬁeld, herbarium
collections based, and laboratory work to assemble
relevant data, as well as large-scale phylogenetic and
diversiﬁcation analyses.
Position characteristics: The Institute of Systematic
Botany in Zurich oﬀers excellent research facilities and
a stimulating working environment for graduate stu-
dents in systematic botany. The project will also in-
volve collaboration with leading researchers in legume
systematics elsewhere. Salary is according to the Swiss
National Science Foundation (SNF) guidelines. Fund-
ing, including for laboratory and ﬁeld costs, is available
for 3 years.
Requirements: Applicants should hold a Masters de-
gree, ideally in taxonomy and biodiversity or related
biological disciplines. Experience in molecular tech-
niques, phylogenetic analysis, and ﬁeldwork are highly
desirable. Excellent knowledge of English, written and
oral, is essential.
How to apply: Send the following documents by email
AS A SINGLE PDF FILE to Dr. Colin Hughes,
colin.hughes@systbot.uzh.ch: i) a two-page application
letter describing your research interests, clearly stating
why are you interested in a Ph.D. position in systematic
botany, and your career goals; ii) your CV, including a
list of publications (if applicable); iii) a copy of your un-
dergraduate and graduate academic record; iv) names

EnvironmentalMedicine
A position in Environmental Medicine at Stony
Brook University described formally below is a cross-
university search coordinated by the Consortium for
Inter-Disciplinary Environmental Research (CIDER).
It is appropriate for individuals in the ﬁelds of evo-
lution and ecology who ﬁt in the categories: genetic
toxicology and toxicogenomics; ecology and evolution
of infectious diseases; and environmental or molecular
epidemiology. An example of a good ﬁt would be a the-
oretical population geneticist whose research involves
human populations and epidemiology. Empirical evo-
lutionists would also ﬁt, so long as there is a dimension
in medicine. Such successful candidates whose research
provides an interface with medicine would neverthe-
less be located in Stony Brook Universitys Department
of Ecology and Evolution. This department already
houses two individuals who have been selected in pre-
vious cross-disciplinary searches by CIDER.

Tromso FishPopGenetics
Vacancy for a PhD Position in population genet-
ics/ecology
The Institute of Marine Research (IMR) has a three-44 EvolDir May 1, 2011
year PhD studentship (code 1017) to work on the
project SNPFISK: “Use of Single Nucleotide Polymor-
phisms to improve ﬁsheries management”. The posi-
tion is in the Research Group on Population Genetic
and Ecology, and the work place is Tromsø.
The aim of the SNPFISK project is to develop a method
for the rapid identiﬁcation of single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNP) for ﬁsh species. SNPs will be developed
for three target taxa: Greenland halibut, North At-
lantic Redﬁsh and Saithe. The three taxa span a wide
geographical range in the North Atlantic, but the con-
nections between possible sub-populations are still un-
resolved. In addition, species identiﬁcation for redﬁsh
remains an acute problem for small individuals. The
SNPs developed will be used to elucidate species identi-
ﬁcation (redﬁsh) and population structure (all selected
species). By resolving species identiﬁcation and popu-
lation structure the results are anticipated to support
ﬁsheries management advice for these key species in the
North Atlantic. The successful candidate will carry out
some laboratory work, conduct the statistical analyses
and contribute to the implementation of the method in
ﬁsheries management in an ecological perspective.
As a part of the project, a stay at the University of
Washington, Seattle USA, is planned.
We wish to appoint a highly motivated person with a
master degree education in population genetic or ecol-
ogy. Good knowledge of statistical inference and practi-
cal experience of statistical softwares is essential. Docu-
mented experience with SNP’s and populations genetic
theory is desirable.
Personal qualities such as good communication and co-
operation skills, the ability to work independently, eﬃ-
ciently and purposefully, as well the ability to generate,
implement and report project activities will be empha-
sised.
Candidates must meet the admission requirements at
the University of Tromsø.
We oﬀer:
* a positive, challenging and creative work environment
* the opportunity to work in a national institute with
a high level of international contact * ﬂexible hours, a
good pension scheme and a wide range of welfare ser-
vices.
The Institute oﬀers governmental regulated salaries as
PhD student (code 1017).

Corophium volutator samples
Hello All,
I am requesting assistance in obtaining samples of
*Corophium volutator* for a phylogeographic study
throughout this species’ range. I am part of a collabora-
tive research group at the University of New Brunswick
studying mudﬂat evolution and ecology, with most of
our work based in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. I am hop-
ing to expand my existing sequence database to include
populations from Europe, the Mediterranean, Japan,
and the Ponto-Caspian (Black, Azov, and Caspian
Seas).
Ideally, I would like to receive ~20-50 individuals
shipped in one or two sealed tubes ( <50mL total) of
95% ethanol to our laboratory in Fredericton, New
Brunswick, Canada for analysis. This collection would
require minimal time investment if researchers are al-
ready conducting ﬁeld work in *C. volutator *habitat.
However, I would also be grateful for any contact in-
formation for researchers who might encounter *C. vo-
lutator *during their ﬁeld studies, or to resources that
might mention speciﬁc areas that are known *C. voluta-
tor *habitat outside of North American and European
waters. All shipping charges will be covered by our
research group. Please do not hesitate to contact me(tony.einfeldt@gmail.com) should you be able to pro-
vide any information regarding this project.

Drosophila shipments to Canada
Hi everyone,
Shipments from the Bloomington Drosophila stock cen-
ter to Canada are becoming increasingly more diﬃ-
cult. Several of our recent shipments have arrived dead.
Bloomington used to ship via FedEx and DHL but both
couriers have now refused to ship live insects (not just
on Canadian shipments) leaving us with a 2-3 week
shipment time via AirMail as the only current option.
Does anybody have any suggestions for a work-around?
Has anybody else encountered these issues?
Cheers, Mark

Eukaryote 18S primers answers
Dear EvolDir members,
Thank you all for your responses to my request about
general eukaryotic 454 primers. I received some very
informative answers, and quite a few people have ex-
pressed their interest in the question. I attach the three
papers suggested by Scott Fay and Simon Creer here.
However, for my part, having checked the supposedly
“general” primers on alignments of protozoa from the
very diverse groups (Ciliates, cercozoans, bodonids,
heterokonts), I would say that I am a bit skeptical about
generality of the primers in some protozoan groups.
But well, lets see - and certainly, there is suﬃcient vari-
ability in this region to enable a satisfactory taxonomic
resolution from only 250 bp, let alone 500 bp. I guess
I will simply have to give it a try and see how it playsout.
Best regards,
Christoﬀer

Hi Christoﬀer
I have checked F04 and R22 for eukaryotes that have
meiobenthic representatives - likewise, they span the
most variable region for metazoa in 18S. Watch out
though, there is a typo in the ME F04 in text primer.
Figure is right and cross check with Nat Comms....
250 bp is too short for Titanium sequencing.

Hi Christoﬀer,
I too have been agonizing a lot over universal Euk

As you know, it’s a new ﬁeld. After looking at the se-
quences myself, I don’t think there is a “magic bullet”
to capture all of Euk diversity in one primer set.
I plan on using the Amaral-Zeller (V9) ones.
Can you please let me know what other responses you

Examples Population
Mismanagement
Hello all,
I am looking for examples where a population has been
over-harvested because it was incorrectly assumed to
be part of a larger population. Or examples of where
a management plan was implemented based on total
numbers but resulted in the loss of a cryptic population
segment (as opposed to the over harvesting of the en-
tire species or population). I commonly use this story
as a cautionary tale about why non-a priori methods
for genetic analysis are important but I don’t know of
any published examples. Most examples I can think of
are over harvesting because of other pressures and then
realization after the fact when the area turns out to
be demographically/genetically independent. For ex-
ample, beluga whales in Eastern Hudson Bay were over
harvested because of market demand not because the
levels were thought to be sustainable at the time.
Any leads would be appreciated.
Thanks Stephen

GoodGenes metaanalysis
DataRequest
Dear All,
We are collecting data for a meta-analysis of good genes
eﬀects in sexual selection, based on literature AND un-
published results.We are interested in studies reporting on - broadly
understood - genetic correlations between male
attractiveness-related traits and ﬁtness components.
Therefore, data on relationships between sire orna-
ments (or other measures of attractiveness) and oﬀ-
spring ﬁtness components (viability, life history, physi-
ological, behavioral - any type of traits really, as long as
there is evidence, or at least a sound reason to believe,
that they are related to ﬁtness); data on heritability of
ornaments (or other attractiveness measures), or data
on genetic correlations calculated from full sib - half sib
experiments or animal model - are of interest for us.
Should you have access to such data in any form - e.g.
unpublished manuscript / thesis / unanalysed raw data
ﬁle etc., but also published papers (we are conducting
a Web of Science search but may not be able to retrieve
each and every one relevant paper this way) - we would
be most grateful if you could share it with us. We will
obviously cite your contribution in the resulting publi-
cation.
We need the following information for our work:
- a measure and direction of the relationship in ques-
tion (results of Pearson’s correlation, regression, t test,
ANOVA, chi square test, or any other test as long as
the exact P value is given - or raw data),
- how were the attractiveness-related and ﬁtness-related
traits measured,
- number of sires and oﬀspring included,
- breeding scheme (observational or experimental),
- whether paternity was certain (experimentally con-
trolled or genetically conﬁrmed) or if not, what is
the frequency of extra-pairyoung in the population on
which the study was conducted (if known),
- environmental conditions sires were raised in (natu-
ral/seminatural, benign laboratory or harsh laboratory
conditions)
- environmental conditions oﬀspring were raised in (as
above)
- any other important details on study design
If you know other researchers who may have access to
such data, please forward this e-mail to them.
Thank you very much in advance for any help you can
provide.

Gypsy database
Dear EvolDir members,
I am glad to announce that the second release of the
Gypsy Database of mobile genetic elements (GyDB)
has been recently launched. The GyDB is a research
project devoted to the evolutionary dynamics of viruses
and transposable elements based on their phylogenetic
classiﬁcation (per lineage and protein domain). It is
powered by MediaWiki (Wikipedia’s wiki platform) and
open to all researchers interested in the ﬁeld. Registra-
tion and use of GyDB is completely free of charge, and
allows users to edit and add new articles, correct en-
tries, or provide more information related to existing
articles. The GyDB oﬀers a peer-reviewed system ran
by a staﬀ of curators in order to keep the information
accurate and up-to-date. All articles provide a “Discus-
sion” tab where registered users may exchange ideas or
provide the rationale for their contributions. Registra-
tion also gives you access to “GyDB People”, a social
network for GyDB collaborators, where you can cus-
tomize your proﬁle, create a blog or send and receive
messages and chat online with other registered users.
Additionally, users can choose to keep both their per-
sonal information and their articles public or private
(this is especially useful for rough edits and works in
progress).
You can access the GyDB with the following URL:
http://gydb.org Feel free to explore the site. All the
GyDB staﬀ are looking forward to seeing you contribute
and enrich the discussion on the site.
This second release of GyDB has an associated pub-
lication in Nucleic Acids Research: Nucl. Acids Res.

Dr Peter Bridgewater Chair, Joint Nature Conservation
Committee “Seeing REDD: Science, Policy and Politics
in Biodiversity and Climate Change
14 April 2011, 6pm Linnean Society of London, Burling-
ton House, Piccadilly, London, W1J 0BF Tea will be
served in the Library from 5.30pm and the lecture will
be followed by a wine reception.
In late October 2010 The Convention on Biological Di-
versity held its tenth meeting, regarded as successfully
achieving a new target for 2020, having missed the tar-
get set for 2010. As the abstract is being written prepa-
rations are in hand for the 16th meeting of the Frame-
work Convention on climate Change, to be held in Can-
cun, December 2010. A key issue for both conventions
is that or Reducing Emissions (of carbon) from De-forestation and (forest) degadation (REDD). This has
morphed to REDD+ in recent discussions, where the
plus includes conservation measures for forests. This
has led to discussions about where the discussions and
decisions on forest, carbon and biodiversity should be
conducted within the UN system. And it ignores the
inconvenient truth that while forests are a signiﬁcant
carbon moderator there are other ecosystems on earth!
This lecture will explore the links between biodiversity
and climate change, the avenues for sensible national
and international discussion and the likely policy out-
comes for biodiversity in the coming decades.

PCR samples methylated spirits
Dear All,
We are experiencing problems with DNA extraction
and PCR of beetle samples stored in methylated
ethanol. The samples were collected as a part of cit-
izen science project, and were stored in the type of
ethanol-based fuel used in camping cookers. Rumour
has it that other labs have had similar problems when
using more exotic cocktails as storage agents, and that
someone has invented a trick to solve this . If anyone
knows more about it, please drop me a line.
The exact content of the stuﬀ that we have used is the
following: Ethanol 90-100 % Propan-2-ol 1-5 % Methyl
ethyl ketone 2 % Methyl isobutyl ketone 2 %

Please come to a free online seminar next week:
Mike Lin speaks Tuesday, April 26th at 12pm PST
on “Locating protein-coding sequences under selection
for additional, overlapping functions in 29 mammalian
genomes”
Abstract: The degeneracy of the genetic code allows
protein-coding DNA and RNA sequences to simulta-
neously encode additional, overlapping functional ele-
ments. A sequence in which both protein-coding and
additional overlapping functions have evolved under
purifying selection should show increased evolutionary64 EvolDir May 1, 2011
conservation compared to typical protein-coding genes
– especially at synonymous sites. We developed a
method to systematically locate short regions within
known ORFs that show conspicuously low estimated
rates of synonymous substitution, based on phyloge-
netic codon rate models and likelihood ratio tests.
We applied this method to genome alignments of 29 pla-
cental mammals, resulting in more than 10,000 synony-
mous constraint elements (SCEs) with resolution down
to nine-codon windows. These are found within more
than a quarter of all human protein-coding genes and
contain ~2% of their synonymous sites. We collected
numerous lines of evidence that the observed synony-
mous constraint in these regions reﬂects selection on
overlapping functional elements including splicing reg-
ulatory elements, dual-coding genes, RNA secondary
structures, microRNA target sites, and developmental
enhancers. We also ruled out certain alternative ex-
planations such as codon usage bias and neutral rate
variation.
Our initial results show that overlapping functional el-
ements are common in mammalian genes, despite the
vast genomic landscape. Furthermore, anticipating the
future availability of additional mammalian and verte-
brate genomes, we are currently developing Bayesian
codon modeling methods to measure synonymous rates
at even higher resolutions, perhaps eventually allowing
the detection of individual regulator binding sites em-
bedded in protein-coding ORFs.

Pruning taxa across trees
Dear colleagues,
I would like to prune the same set of taxa from a sam-
ple of trees ( ~5000) obtained with BEAST 1.6.1 but I
don’t seem to ﬁnd an easy way to do this without hav-
ing to remove the taxa in every tree one by one. I have
tried using drop.tip function in R but does not seemto do the job; it does not recognise the set of phyloge-
nies as a phylo object (either when loaded as nexus or
newick format, which I guess is due to the ﬁle having
more than one tree as drop.tip works ﬁne with a single
tree loaded), although R recognises correctly the num-
ber of phylogenetic trees. I have also tried the “sapply”
function with drop.tip, but again when I try to save the
supposedly pruned trees into a ﬁle, or plot any of them,
I get an error message. So my question is simple, does
anyone know how to prune taxa from a sample of trees
in R or in any other Mac-friendly programme?
Thanks a lot.
Cheers,
Ramiro

A number of evolutionary biologists are working on
the successor to the MrBayes program. The new pro-
gram is to be called RevBayes. It has an R-like
language for specifying evolutionary models and per-
forms Bayesian estimation of the parameters (using
Markov chain Monte Carlo to do the numerical sum-
mation/integration).
This is to announce a contest for an icon for the pro-
gram. The winner of the best design will receive $500.
Entries must be received by July 15, 2011. Please send
your entry to johnh@berkeley.edu.
Keep in mind that the icon should be in digital form, of
high quality, and be distinctive even when it is small.

Seminar questions
Dear all,
There was an evoldir discussion / post on a taxonomy of
questions asked during seminar (“types of questions”,
or something to that eﬀect). The discussion ran over
10 years ago, and now I don’t seem to be able to ﬁnd
the text and whoever wrote it.
Does anyone know what I am talking about? Can you
send it to me?
Sorry for the apparently frivolous posting, but it was a
truly excellent write up and I wonder if someone still
has that text.

Software AFLPOP v1 2
Dear evoldir members,
AFLPOP was designed primarily to solve the popula-
tion allocation problem based on AFLP markers: Given
an AFLP genotype and a set of candidate populations
deﬁned by AFLP samples, what population is the geno-
type most likely to belong to?
A new version (1.2) of AFLPOP is now available. The
functionalities provided in AFLPOP 1.2 are exactly the
same as those implemented in AFLPOP 1.1. However
this new version may be run on a much broader set of
operating systems (OS) and OFFICE versions.
Users are invited to make suggestions
and report bugs by sending e-mails to
either Pierre.Duchesne@bio.ulaval.ca or
Julie.Turgeon@bio.ulaval.ca.

Software PAPA AFLP
Dear evoldir members,
We wish to announce the ﬁrst version of the parental
allocation program PAPA AFLP (1.0).
PAPA AFLP is designed to allocate parental pairs on
the basis of AFLP genotypes. It is assumed that the al-
location system is either closed or semi-closed. A closed
allocation system is one in which all oﬀspring have their
two parental genotypes included in the parental ﬁles. A
semi-closed allocation system is one in which the num-
ber of missing parental genotypes is small and is known
precisely or nearly so for each parental ﬁle. An exam-
ple of a semi-closed system: all putative parents have
been kept in captivity prior to breeding but the geno-
types of some of the parents are not available due to lab
problems or mortality. The parental genotypes may be
sexed or non-sexed. Also, they may come from one
or two populations. This feature is especially useful
when studying hybridization between pairs of popula-
tions. Both allocations of real oﬀspring and simulations
may be performed. Simulations provide an estimate of
the proportion of correct allocations.
A User Guide is provided which describes the
uses, working principle, procedures, formats and
parameters in PAPA AFLP. Its interface is user-
friendly and similar to that of AFLPOP (Duch-
esne & Bernatchez 2002). Users are invited
to make suggestions and report bugs by sending
e-mails to either Pierre.Duchesne@bio.ulaval.ca or
Julie.Turgeon@bio.ulaval.ca.

SouthAfrica 2 Volunteers
SmallMammalEvolution
2 volunteers needed from July / August to November
/ December 2011 onwards
as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility
in the striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the
habitat is open, direct behavioral observations in the
ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are also expected to help with
maintenance of the research station (water pump, solar
power, etc.)
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-May 1, 2011 EvolDir 67
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 150 US$, 110 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. For students with
their own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250
(approx. 190 US$, 140 Euro) per month applies. Stu-
dents must buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs
of about R 2250, approx. 340 US$ or 250 Euro/month).
Including extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you
should expect costs of about 550 US$, 450 Euros per
month. Students get an invitation letter which they
can use to apply for funding in their home country (eg.
DAAD in Germany, SSJARP in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
2 volunteers for the period July / August to November
/ December. Volunteers are expected to stay at least 4
months, but longer periods of up to 6months are possi-
ble.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch.

Spectrophotometer LightSource
Dear all,
I’m currently considering purchase of Ocean Optics
Jaz spectrophotometer but I’m wondering which light
source would be the best? The main use of the spec-
trophotmeter will be reﬂectance measurements of bird
plumage both in UV and VIS range. Two possible so-
lutionas are tungsten-deuterium light source and xenon
pulsed source, more less equally frequently reported in
papers. I would really appreciate any recommendations
and advantages of using either of these sources.

answers
Hi all,
about 2 weeks ago I posted several questions about
JAZ OCean Optics spectrophotometer. I was wonder-
ing which light source (deuterium-tungsten or xenon
pulsed) would be the most appropriate. First of all -
I’d like to thank everyone who answered my concerns -
you’re comments were very useful and valuable :) From
what I’ve received it seems clear that both light sources
have pros and cons. Deuterium one: requires up to
30 min warm-up (which may be annoying) and gen-
erates signiﬁcant amounts of heat, however oﬀers very
stable and smooth emission spectrum; xenon one is op-
erational without warm-up and seems to require less
power (which would be precious in ﬁeld applications)
but generates constant (although not very loud) noise
and has more irregular emission spectrum. For me it’s
clear that PX-2 (xenon source) is better. As one of
You mentioned, with PX-2 one has to be careful as
the light seems to contain diﬀerent amounts of shorter
wavelengths right after turning on and later after sev-
eral minutes so it’s a good idea to take several mea-
surements and average the spectra. Importantly I was
reassured that JAZ with either PX-2 or DT does not
require any additional powering module apart from the
one powering the spectrophotometer.
Thanks for all your remarks! Cheers, szymek

VolunteerAvianFieldAssistant
Two volunteer ﬁeld assistants are needed to assist mul-
tiple PhD projects on the chestnut-crowned babbler
during the 2011 breeding season. Primary duties will
include assisting with mist-netting and ﬁeld experi-
ments, monitoring groups for breeding activity, and
data entry. The work will often require starting be-
fore dawn and days oﬀ will be irregular and dependent
on the weather.
The study site is located in western New South Wales,
within a research station owned and run by UNSW.
The station is approximately 90 minutes’ drive from
the nearest settlement, and visits there are generally
limited to food and equipment shopping.
Successful applicants will need to be able to work inde-
pendently and in a team, as well as being physically ﬁt
and having a tolerance for working in extreme environ-
ments. A positive attitude and enthusiasm for the work
is essential. Previous experience working with birds,
particularly mist-netting experience, would be an as-
set. The position would suit recent graduates from a
relevant discipline that wish to develop their ﬁeld ex-
perience or understanding of ecological research.
The dates of the position are approximately 20th July -
20th October with a possible extension into November
depending on the quality of the breeding season.
There is no salary for the position, but food and ac-
commodation at the station will be provided. Assis-
tants must cover their own transport costs to and from
the ﬁeld station. To apply, email a letter of inter-
est (include dates of availability), resume, and con-
tact information for three referees to JAMES SAVAGE
(jls59@cam.ac.uk). Applications will be reviewed as
they are received; the closing date is Friday 6th of May.

Volunteer FieldAssist
MadagascarLemurs
Volunteer Field Assistant for a Lemur Diet Study in
Madagascar
Hiring Organization: PhD student, University of
Southern California
Date Posted: 2011-04-13
Position Description: I am searching for a volunteer
ﬁeld assistant to work on a study of the diet of wild
lemurs. This project, which is a part of my doctoral
research, will study the eﬀect of diet on the gut bacte-
ria in two species of wild lemurs: the ring-tailed lemur
(Lemur catta) and Verreauxˆ as sifaka (Propithecus ver-
reauxi). Speciﬁcally, I will be investigating the eﬀect
of ingested plant chemical defenses on the lemursˆ a gut
bacteria. The ﬁeld assistant will be involved in observa-
tions of the lemurs, identifying plant species, recording
their feeding behavior, as well as collecting samples of
the plants they consume. The ﬁeld assistant will also
help collect fecal samples from the lemurs, which will
be preserved for later analysis of the bacteria present.
The assistant will be trained in all relevant data collec-
tion and archiving methods. This position provides an
excellent opportunity to gain serious experience in ﬁeld-
work, animal behavior research, and behavioral ecology
methods.
The work days will be long, heading into the forestaround 7am and ﬁnishing around 6pm. We will come
back to camp for a brief lunch around mid-day. Addi-
tional time entering the dayˆ as data may be required in
the evening. We will work 6 days a week, with 1 day
oﬀ to take care of laundry, relax, and read. Fieldwork
will be from September 2011 through February 2012.
The ﬁeld site, Beza Mahafaly special reserve, is a trop-
ical dry forest in southwest Madagascar. The terrain
is ﬂat, but the wet season (approximately November
through February) will be hot and humid, with brief
rain daily. There is a grid system of trails through the
forest (making it diﬃcult to be lost for long), but we will
often go oﬀ-trail to ﬁnd and follow the lemurs. There
are many plants with thorns and spikes in the forest,
but there are few lethal creatures (you will deﬁnitely
encounter some wasps and spiders). There are many
groups of both lemur species in the forest and most in-
dividuals have been collared and tagged for easy iden-
tiﬁcation. Two other species of lemur (the grey-brown
mouse lemur and the white-footed sportive lemur), In-
dian civets, feral cats, tortoises, as well as many bird
and insect species also live in the forest. Accommoda-
tions at the ﬁeld site are rustic but adequate (tents, pit
toilet, solar showers, well water, little solar electricity
for charging electronics). A local cook will cook all of
our meals (mostly rice and beans). Communication is
limited at the ﬁeld site. There is no internet and some
cellphone reception can be gained by a 20-minute walk
from camp. I am hoping to have a satellite phone for
emergencies. There are several villages nearby, but the
closest town with services is a 6-hour walk or cart ride.
Qualiﬁcations/Experience: Intended for undergradu-
ates or early graduate level students specializing in Bi-
ology, Animal Behavior, or Anthropology. Other areas
of specialization will be considered. This job presents
the ideal opportunity for individuals with a Bachelorˆ as
or Masters degree that are hoping to go on into post-
graduate research but require ﬁeld-experience. Exist-
ing ﬁeldwork experience is therefore not required, but
experience working in tropical forests, working with an-
imals, and/or working in the outdoors will be beneﬁ-
cial. Successful applicants will have an excellent level of
physical ﬁtness and be able to work independently un-
der isolated and demanding conditions (10 hour days,
6 days a week) in a hot and humid environment. The
position is not ideal for someone who needs a lot of
personal time, or for someone who easily feels lonely.
The ideal applicant will: ˆ a Have a strong interest in
animal behavior or ecology; ˆ a Have experience work-
ing on a scientiﬁc research project, collecting and
working systematically with data, ideally an observa-
tional/behavioral project and will understand the sci-
entiﬁc method; ˆ a Be hardworking and motivated; ˆ a70 EvolDir May 1, 2011
Be comfortable being unplugged and a distance from
easy communication with the outside world (limited
phone and no internet access); ˆ a Feel comfortable be-
ing far away from family and friends for an extended
period of time; ˆ a Have above average resistance to so-
cial/psychological stress with a tolerance towards local
customs and beliefs and be comfortable with other con-
ditions and risks that are simply part of tropical ﬁeld-
work, such as limited healthcare, monotonous diet, and
rare confrontations with noxious plants or animals; ˆ a Be
responsible, reliable, a team player able to work out anyissues civilly, and able to follow ﬁeld procedures care-
fully; ˆ a Have previous experience with animal behavior
in general, or primates in speciﬁc; ˆ a Have experience
traveling or living in a foreign country, preferably in
developing countries;

Bergen FishEvolutionaryGenetics
Post Doctoral position: Modeling genetic interactions
between wild and farmed ﬁsh
The Institute of Marine Research has a two-year post
doctoral research position available to work with mod-
eling genetic interactions between wild and farmed ﬁsh.
The position will be connected to the Population Ge-
netics and Ecology research group in Bergen. The posi-
tion will be linked to the modeling work-package in the
Strategic Institute Project “INTERACT”, ﬁnanced by
the Norwegian research council. Building upon pub-
lished data, current models and state-of the art, the
work-package aims to advance models to quantify the
interactions between wild and farmed ﬁshes, for both
Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon. The ultimate aim is
to identify “break points” for tolerance of genetic intro-
gression in wild populations.
Together with members of the research team, the ap-
pointee will have responsibility for establishing, testing
and publishing new models that shed light onto the
consequences of farmed escapees and tolerable levels of
introgression in wild populations. This will be achieved
through developing models describing dynamics of wild
salmon and cod populations that are interacting and
potentially interbreeding with conspeciﬁc ﬁsh of aqua-
culture origin. Important parameters to be tested in-
clude numbers of escapees, ﬁtness of hybrids, and be-
havioural interactions between wild and cultured ﬁsh.
We wish to appoint a highly motivated person with a
PhD in modeling, statistical genetics, population ecol-
ogy or related discipline. The appointee will need to
be able to document experience of programming anduse of models to study dynamical systems in biology.
Previous experience with modelling of ﬁsh population
dynamics is not necessary but is considered advanta-
geous.
The Institute emphasises personal qualities such as
good communication and cooperative skills, the abil-
ity to work independently and as part of an active re-
search team. A record of publishing in this ﬁeld will be
considered and advantage.
We oﬀer:
* a positive, challenging and creative work environ-
ment * the opportunity to work in a national insti-
tute with a high level of international contact * ﬂexi-
ble hours, a good pension scheme and a wide range of
welfare services. The Institute oﬀers governmental reg-
ulated salaries as post doctor (code 1352 post doctor).
Roughly, this salary equates to approximately 45 000
UK pounds per year (forty ﬁve thousand uk pounds).

Job description:
The Russell lab at Drexel University seeks a postdoc-
toral researcher for a position spanning June 2011-
February 2014. This NSF funded research (NSF Award
ID: DEB-1050360) will focus on symbioses between
ants and bacterial gut associates, addressing the hy-
pothesis that nutritional symbionts have facilitated the
evolution of low-quality, herbivorous diets in the ants
(for background, see Russell et al. 2009 at: http:/-
/www.pnas.org/content/106/50/21236.full ). Through
collaboration with PI Corrie Moreau (at The Field Mu-
seum of Natural History), one graduate student (at
Drexel), and PI Jacob Russell, the postdoc will study
microbial gut bacteria through the use of 454 amplicon
sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, using the ant phylogeny
and trophic classiﬁcation to quantify the relationship
between diet, relatedness, and gut community compo-
sition. The position will also involve microscopy and
collaboration on experiments designed to identify thenutritional roles of gut bacteria.
Background in microbial ecology and evolu-
tion are preferable, while skills in microscopy,
bioinformatics, and basic molecular biology
are strongly preferred. Interested applicants
should apply at www.drexeljobs.com/applicants/-

Postdoctoral position: Genomic analysis of recombina-
tion and adaptation in bacteriaMay 1, 2011 EvolDir 73
“Why do organisms have sex?” is a central question
in evolutionary biology but one that has been diﬃcult
to study empirically. Bacteria and Archea represent
the bulk of living organisms and import DNA from
other strains into their genomes by diverse mechanisms.
This project will use the 1000s of bacterial genomes
that are becoming available to characterize the role
of this recombination in adaptation. The project will
make use of statistical genetic algorithms ClonalFrame
and ClonalOrigin to identify individual recombination
events and the genetic changes they introduce.
The project is a collaboration between Daniel Falush
(Leipzig), Xavier Didelot (University of Oxford) and
Eduardo Rocha (Pasteur Institute, Paris). The ap-
plicant will be based at the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig which is home to
a diverse group of researchers interested in the genetics
of adaptation. See: http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics
Desirable skills include knowledge of modern computa-
tionally intensive statistics, programming in C or C++,
bioinformatics ability, knowledge of evolutionary biol-
ogy and population genetics. However, applications are
welcomed from any candidate with good quantitative
skills and enthusiasm for the subject area. The initial
period of employment is 2 years , with the possibility
of extension. Please contact daniel falush@eva.mpg.de

Postdoctoral Research Assistant/AssociateAssessing the impact of plant mating system and ploidy
on adaptation to parasitism in changing environments
Ref: M00131
Salary: Grade 6 £25,854 - £29,099 / Grade 7 £31,798
-£35,788 per annum
This job is part of a UK Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC) funded project to investigate the in-
ﬂuence of variation in host mating system and ploidy
level on pathogen response systems and on the dynam-
ics of host-parasite co-evolution. The project is run
jointly with researchers at the University of Warwick
(Prof. Eric Holub).
Although host distributions have been the focus of
other studies, the impacts that mating system and
ploidy have on pathogen response systems have been
less well studied. We propose to use a wild host species
that varies in these traits (Arabidopsis lyrata: Brassi-
caceae) and an important pathogen of crop plants in
the Brassicaceae (oomycetes in the genus Albugo) as a
model to investigate these types of interactions. For-
merly considered as one species, it is now known that
there are multiple species of Albugo that infect both
wild and domesticated plants in the Brassicaceae. We
propose to use this system to: 1) evaluate whether re-
sponse to infection with Albugo varies by mating sys-
tem, ploidy or geographic distribution of A. lyrata; 2)
evaluate the extent to which wild populations of A.
lyrata are naturally infected with the various species
of Albugo; 3) assess levels of genomic variation between
isolates of Albugo infecting various host species; 4) com-
pare the relative performance of A. lyrata populations
in response to Albugo epidemics caused by exposure to
an Albugo strained carried by A. thaliana under semi-
natural epidemic conditions; and 5) investigate the ge-
netic basis for variation in resistance to Albugo in nat-
ural populations of A. lyrata.
The Glasgow PDRA would be primarily responsible for
generating crosses to assess the genetic basis of host
responses, for generating and analysing whole-genome
scale sequence data, and investigating variation at can-
didate genes for resistance.
This post has funding for 24/28 months, depending on
level of appointment. The preferred starting date is
September, 2011.

DrosophilaEvolutionaryBiology
Post doc position in Evolutionary Biology: The role of
non-genetic inheritance in adaptive evolution
Apart from DNA also non-genetic factors are transmit-
ted from parent to oﬀspring. Much evidence points to
that these factors have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
phenotype of oﬀspring, but their ability to respond
to selection and contribute to adaptive evolution has
rarely been tested. Using the powerful model system
of Drosophila melanogaster this project aims to select
for paternal eﬀects on a life-history trait and measure
the response. Follow up experiments will try to tease
apart through what mechanism(s) the paternal eﬀects
are mediated through.
We are now looking for a highly motivated post doc
to lead this project. The ideal candidate has a back-
ground in evolutionary genetics and experience with
Drosophila, as well as a strong interest in statis-
tics. He/she should work well both as a mem-
ber of a group and independently, and also be pro-
ﬁcient in both written and spoken English. The
successful candidate will join a research group led
by Urban Friberg ( http://www.ebc.uu.se/Research/-
IEG/evbiol/research/Friberg/ ). Applications should
be written in English and include i) personal infor-
mation/background, ii) a description of research inter-
ests (max 1-2 pages), iii) complete CV, iv) names andemail addresses of 2-3 referees. Applications should be

USouthampton MolecluarEvolution
Applications are invited for the post of Postdoctoral Re-
search Fellow to work closely with Dr Richard Edwards
on a BBSRC-funded project using molecular evolution
to develop and apply computational tools for the pre-
diction of protein motifs that mediate protein-protein
interactions.
Many protein-protein interactions are mediated by
Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs): short stretches of pro-
teins (5-15 amino acids long), of which only a few posi-
tions are critical to function. These motifs are vital for
biological processes of fundamental importance, such as
signalling pathways and targeting proteins to the cor-
rect part of a cell. The primary objective of this project
is to integrate a number of leading computational tech-
niques to predict novel SLiMs and, in so doing, add
crucial detail to protein-protein interaction networks.
The project will use a number of computational and se-
quence analysis techniques. Basic programming skills
are essential. Experience with database design, HPC
and web programming are highly desirable. You will
be required to develop a thorough knowledge of SLiM-
mediated protein-protein interactions and should there-
fore be comfortable with biological literature, bio-
chemistry, molecular evolution and structural biology.
Please note that the project is 100% computational.
A background in either computer science or biology,
with a PhD in a relevant subject area, is essential.
Previous research experience (PhD or Postdoctoral)
in computational biology is highly desirable. Candi-
dates with a computer science background must demon-
strate an interest and aptitude for molecular biology.
Similarly, candidates with a biology background must
demonstrate an interest and aptitude for computer pro-
gramming. Project management skills and independent
research experience are desirable. You should be an en-
thusiastic researcher, a good team worker and an excel-
lent communicator.
The position is full-time and available immediately for a
period of three years. Start date is ﬂexible but the suc-
cessful candidate must be in post by September 2011.The application deadline is 16 May 2011.

BrassicaEvolutionaryGenetics
Genetic and ecophysiological analyses of natural varia-
tion in the control of water use eﬃciency and response
to drought stress in Brassica rapa.
Two post-doctoral positions are available to study eco-
physiological and genetic mechanisms of adaptation
to atmospheric and soil drought stress in the labs of
Cynthia Weinig and Brent Ewers at the University
of Wyoming. These positions are associated with a
ﬁve-year multi-investigator NSF project that includes
collaborators from Dartmouth College, University of
Wisconsin-Madison and Oregon State University. The
overarching aim of the project is to identify the traits
and genes involved in adaptation to atmospheric and
soil drought stress, including the role of the circadian
clock in regulating plant ecophysiological traits. Re-
search questions include: What are the structural and
ecophysiological traits that confer adaptation to soil
and atmospheric drought stress? What QTL and ge-
netic loci underlie variation in the expression of adap-
tive ecophysiological traits? What role does quanti-
tative variation in the circadian clock play in regulat-
ing ecophysiological traits? To what extent does the
clock model developed in Arabidopsis translate to other
species?
Preference will be given to candidates with a strong
background in ecophysiology (working in the Ewers
lab) or evolutionary genetics (working in the Weinig
lab). Each position will present opportunities to learn
new measurement and analytical techniques in al-
ternative disciplines through collaboration with other
labs. Activities of the diﬀerent labs will include de-
velopment of Nested Association Mapping populations
(NAM), quantitative-genetic analysis and QTL map-
ping of drought responses in RILs and natural acces-
sions of B. rapa, ﬁne-scale mapping and transgenic res-
cue to clone QTL for the ecophysiological components
of water-use eﬃciency, ecophysiological analyses at mul-
tiple scales of the connection between plant gas ex-
change and hydraulics in response to atmospheric and
soil drought, and development and dissemination of B.
rapa genetic resources for enhancing K12 and under-
graduate education. In addition, each position requires
data analysis, publication of manuscripts and partici-
pation in workshops on career development.May 1, 2011 EvolDir 83

Programme This advanced course covers statistical
methods currently used to map disease susceptibility
genes, with an emphasis on (but not limited to) meth-
ods that can analyse family data or a combination
of families and individuals. Discussions of the latest
statistical methodology are complemented by practical
hands-on computer exercises using state-of-the-art soft-
ware. The statistical basics behind each method will
be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand.
With a focus on family data, we will discuss funda-
mental issues needed to increase success in gene map-ping studies including: optimal study design, power to
detect linkage and association, determining the most
appropriate statistical methods and software, interpre-
tation of statistical results and trouble shooting. We
will also cover the basic principles of statistical infer-
ence, hypothesis testing, population and quantitative
genetics and Mendelian inheritance. Our interactive
and intensive educational program will enable one to
better carry out sophisticated statistical analyses of ge-
netic data, and will also improve one’s interpretation
and understanding of the results. All the software used
is freely available, so that skills learned can be easily
applied after the course.

State University, Raleigh, NC
Website: https://academy.nescent.org/wiki/-
Practical computing forbiologists As part of the
new NESCent Academy initiative, NESCent is pleased
to accept applications for Practical Computing for
Biologists. This course covers the simple but powerful
skills that all scientists should know in a world of
increasingly complex analyses. This is not a typical
bioinformatics course, although the lessons are ap-
plicable to molecular data. The skills are applicable
to any subdiscipline where gathering and analyzing
moderate to large data sets are involved. The speciﬁc
sections include working with text ﬁles, command-line
operations, scripting and Python programming, creat-
ing scientiﬁc graphics, working with servers (remote
login, software installation), and a bit about the weband data-acquisition hardware.
This course is timely because biologists and other re-
searchers are expected to analyze larger and more com-
plex data sets, but using inadequate tools like spread-
sheets. Although the examples will be shown making
use of Mac OSX and its Unix underpinnings, all of the
tools discussed are cross-platform and freely available.
Participants will be able to take the techniques and
skills they learn back to their labs to continue making
their own research easier and more eﬀective. The tar-
get audience for the course is anyone with data: grad
students, post-docs, technicians, and faculty.
Practical Computing for Biologists is based on the book
of the same name by Steven Haddock and Casey Dunn.
The course is co-sponsored by the NESCent and the
Department of Genetics / Initiative in Biological Com-
plexity at North Carolina State University.

Advanced Techniques in Genome Analysis
Poznan Summer School of Bioinformatics is a compre-
hensive course of bioinformatics. The course is best pre-
pared for those who have little knowledge in bioinfor-
matics and ﬁnd it necessary/interesting to learn more
in this ﬁeld. It is therefore aimed to give the oppor-
tunity to ﬁnd out how to use some basic bioinformatic
tools and how to perform bioinformatic analyses in your
research.
The course consists of lectures (by scientists from
Poland and abroad) and hands-on - this combination
should ﬁt best your needs as you have a chance to try
the methods out yourself. We cover the following sub-
jects (which we ﬁnd most interesting and up-to-date):
* Population genetics in the genomic era * Next gen-
eration sequencing technologies * Sequence assembly *
Genome wide association studies * miRNAs and their
targets * Genome wide analysis of repetitive elements *
Tools for genome annotations and analysis * Gene com-plexity and alternative splicing * Reactome - reactions,
pathways and biological processes
Details can be found at the workshop website: http:/-

Aquatic GIS Training Workshop Announcement GIS
Applications in Aquatic Ecology and Evolutionary Bi-
ology
An NSF supported three day aquatic GIS training
workshop will be oﬀered at Saint Louis University on
June 22-24, 2011 and August 17-19, 2011. A general
goal of this workshop is to train and establish an in-
teractive group of researchers and educators applying
GIS techniques in aquatic systems. Applicants with
all levels of GIS experience are welcome; however, the
workshop will be presented for aquatic biologists with
little to no background in GIS techniques.
The tentative schedule of topics includes: 1) basic ac-
quisition and manipulation of GIS data, 2) GIS data
sources for aquatic research, 3) quantiﬁcation of species
habitat use at multiple spatial scales, 4) species distri-
bution modeling, and 5) development and application of
hydrologic data to studies of aquatic systems. More de-
tails on the speciﬁc schedule will be provided in the near
future. The majority of the training will be conducted
using ArcGIS 10.0; however, other software options will
be presented. Computer space will be provided for each
attendee.
The workshop is open to Faculty, Research Scientists,
Postdoctoral Researchers, and Graduate Students con-
ducting research in aquatic systems. There is no cost
for the workshop; however, participants will be respon-
sible for meals, travel, and lodging. Details and up-
dates will be available at http://pages.slu.edu/faculty/-
jknouft/index ﬁles/Page304.htm . To apply, please
email a statement of application including a descrip-
tion of your research interests (maximum 1 page) and aMay 1, 2011 EvolDir 93
CV to Dr. Jason Knouft at aquaticgis@slu.edu. Review
of applications will begin on April 30, 2011. GIS expe-
rience is not a prerequisite for the workshop. A total of
20 spots are available for each workshop. Please indi-
cate the dates you would like to attend (June 22-24 or
August 17-19). If you are available for both dates (one
or the other), please indicate this in your application.

Graduate Summer Session 2011
July 25-29, 2011
Betsy Foxman and Randolph Nesse
Course Description: New applications of evolutionary
theory to medicine are growing and helping to ex-
plain apparent paradoxes, such as rapidly increasing
rates of breast cancer, increased asthma vulnerabil-
ity in certain populations and the metabolic syndrome
(For details see The Evolution Network at http://-
evolutionandmedicine.org ). Epidemiologists have be-
gun to apply these principles and ask new questions,
such as do genes that vary by latitude explain hyperten-
sion, and how might public health interventions for in-
fectious disease be ’evolution-proofed’ This course will
explore how epidemiologists and other public health
workers can make use of these advances in their own
work. Applying evolutionary theory can sharpen re-
search questions, raise new possible explanations for
observed phenomena and identify new types of expo-
sure and outcome measures.
Pre-requisites: No prior training in evolutionary biol-
ogy is assumed.

ological questions, and is expanding dramatically with
the ﬂood of DNA sequence data. This intensive four-
day course will give a thorough introduction to the sub-
ject, showing its broad scope, and teaching a variety of
techniques that can be used to model the evolutionary
process, and that can be applied to diverse problems.
The course is aimed at graduate students with diverse
backgrounds - both in evolutionary biology, and coming
in from diﬀerent ﬁelds. Teaching will be a combinationof lectures, discussion groups, and worked examples;
simulation software will be provided.

Time and Venue: June 27-July 1 2011 Xishuangbanna
Tropical Botanical Garden, Yunnan, China
The workshop is designed to be the ﬁrst step in devel-
oping long-term working groups and collaborations fo-
cused on the genomic diversiﬁcation of tropical plants.
Registered participants will have access to available Il-
lumina data obtained from whole genome samples of
numerous species of tropical tree, primarily in the genus
Ficus (ﬁgs) and the family Fagaceae (oaks, stone oaks,
chestnuts and beeches). Whole transcriptome data
from developing ﬂowers is expected to be available for
some ﬁg samples. During the workshop, participants
will make further plans for manuscripts, analyses, pro-
posals, and future meetings.96 EvolDir May 1, 2011
Prior to the workshop, a brief summary of the sample
species and their biological characteristics will be pro-
vided, so the participants can familiarize themselves
with the biological framework of the samples. Addi-
tionally, sets of draft questions and analyses will be
provided through Google Docs (if you need to set up a
Google account, please let us know), allowing partici-
pants to become familiar with the speciﬁc objectives of
the workshop, to comment on the questions and analy-
ses, and propose new ones. The list of conﬁrmed partic-
ipants below will potentially lead discussion of speciﬁc
topics that will then break out into working groups each
day.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.May 1, 2011 EvolDir 97
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
