Dear all,
The *World Congress of Malacology* will take place on
August 11'16, 2019 at Asilomar Conference Grounds,
Pacic Grove, CA, USA.
The scientic program includes the symposium: *The
Evolution of Molluscan Weirdness ' mechanisms and tem-
pos of phenotypic diversity.* The goal of this symposium
is to discuss both deep time and shallow time aspects
of molluscan morphological disparity. Investigations
focused on molluscan body plan evolution, phylogeny,
rapid phenotypic changes, and adaptations are abso-
lutely welcomed. In addition, integrative approachesleading with genomics, fossil record, and morphology
are also of great contribution to explore mechanisms
and patterns of molluscan evolution.
Reduced registration fees until April 15 and the deadline
for abstract submissions is April 30. More information at
the conference website: https://calacademy.org/world-
congress-of-malacology-2019 Please spread the word!

Dear Evoldir community, Please nd here an invitation
to participate in our rst Comparative Cartilage Biology
meeting, held in Banyuls-sur-mer on the 24-26th June
2019
This conference will take a uniquely broad approach to
cartilage biology, combining researchers with expertise
in developmental genetics , biomaterials & biomedicine
, and evolution of cartilage . To build wider concepts
in cartilage biology, we will pay particular attention to
work on less studied cartilage types, on evolutionary
perspectives of skeletal diversity and on less traditional
models for skeletal biology (with particular focus on
sharks and rays), and how these can enhance mod-
ern medical understandings of cartilage. In bringing
together diverse cartilage research, we hope this the
meeting will integrate the full community of cartilage
biologists, accelerating research innovation, interdisci-
plinary collaboration and community-building.

Symposium overview In the last few decades, genet-
ics played an increasingly important role in the infer-
ence of human history and our understanding of hu-
man evolution. Genetics helped to establish Africa as
the birthplace of anatomically modern humans. More-
over, genetic studies provided conclusive information
that helped to answer challenging questions, such as
the 'Out-of-Africa' migration of modern humans and
genetic relationships among diverse linguistic, geograph-March 1, 2019 EvolDir 5
ical and cultural groups. The history of human pop-
ulations in Africa is complex and includes various de-
mographic events that inuenced patterns of genetic
variation across the continent. Genetic studies based on
mitochondrial-DNA, Y-chromosomes, autosomal mark-
ers, whole genomes, and ancient DNA contributed to
unraveling the genetic sub-structure of African popula-
tions and populations of African descent. Through these
studies, it became evident that the African subsistence
practices shaped the genomes of African populations
and the distribution of current-day Africans. With the
increased availability of full genomic data from diverse
African populations and prehistoric Africans, the next
few years will be an exciting period for human popula-
tion genetic research in Africa. In this symposium, we
aim to assemble ndings from the eld of genetics that
contributed to reveal population history and patterns
of genetic diversity and adaptation in Africa.

Manchester SMBEMajorTransitions
Jul21-25
We would like to invite you to the symposium on \The
molecular basis of major transition in evolution", to be
held during the SMBE meeting in Manchester (21-25
July). More information about the SMBE symposia
can be found here: http://smbe2019.org/programme/-
symposia-overview/ The history of life on Earth shows
major evolutionary transitions, shifts in which new bio-
logical features emerged that dramatically changed the
biology of organisms. The endless forms most beauti-
ful we observe today are the result of these revolutions
that shaped the biology of the planet. These innovations
were at the centre of the seminal book \The Major Tran-
sitions in Evolution" by John Maynard Smith and E ors
Szathm ary, published nearly 25 years ago. They include
the origins of cells and sex, major endosymbiotic events,
or the rise of multicellularity and societies among oth-
ers. The abundance of genomic data, new evolutionary
algorithms, and emerging technologies - such as single-
cell sequencing - oer a timely opportunity to study
the molecular changes underlying most of these major
transitions. Recent research has showed the importance
of gene duplication (e.g., the origins of multicellularity),
the evolution of cell types (the rise of animals or the
nervous system), or the fusion of genomes from dierent
organisms (eukaryotes and photosynthesis). In this sym-
posium we will explore the molecular basis associated
with these transitions at dierent organisation levels,
from genes and cells to complete organisms.
Invited speakers E ors Szathm ary, Biological Institute,
E otv os University, Hungary Puricacion Lopez-Garcia,
CNRS, University of Paris Sud, France
The deadline for Abstract submission is 17th March.

We are organizing again the evolutionary biology meet-
ing at Marseilles ( 24-27 2019 )
The DL is end of june
more info aeeb.fr and twitter :EvolBiolMeetingMarseilles
The Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles is an
annual congress which has gathered high level experts
in evolutionary biology since its creation in 1997.
If the congress was initially a local meeting, it quickly
gained an important weight in the scientic life. Indeed,
whereas the number of participants has been increas-
ing, the geographical origin of the researchers has been
diversifying and widening year by year.
Today, the Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Mar-
seilles has reached a worldwide dimension and plays a
paramount role in the international scientic life: allow-
ing the gathering of high level specialists, it encourages
the exchange of ideas and stimulates the works of the
researchers all through the world.
The following subjects will be discussed:
* Evolutionary biology concepts and modeling; * Biodi-
versity and Systematics; * Comparative genomics ans
post-genomics (at all taxomic levels); * Functional phy-
logeny; * Environment and biological evolution; * Origin
of life and exobiology; * Non-adaptative versus adapta-
tive evolution; * The minorphyla: their usefulness
in evolutionary biology knowledge; * Convergent evolu-
tion * Evolution of complex traits (Evo-Devo)

Meeting description Genomics tools have never been so
powerful and accessible to biologists interested in how
the interplay between ecological and evolutionary forces
is shaping biodiversity. The 2019 Gordon Research
Conference on Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics
will explore how the genome-scale processes that un-
derpin organismal phenotypes interact with ecological
and evolutionary processes over multiple spatiotemporal
scales. The meeting will be preceded by a Gordon Re-
search Seminar (GRS), which will provide opportunities
for early career researchers (students and postdocs) to
present their projects and will include a special mentor-
ship session.
Topics highlighted at the meeting will include: the eco-
logical and evolutionary signicance of novel genes and
variation in genome architecture, including genomic
conicts; the role of hybridization and introgressionas drivers of diversity; genome-scale perspectives on
the role of the microbiome in host adaptations; and
the increasing contribution of genomics to explanations
of ecosystem function. This meeting will also bring
the latest technological developments in genomics and
genome manipulation, emphasizing their application to
non-model species. Join us to participate in creative dis-
cussions in an inclusive social and scientic atmosphere,
to empower the future research in the eld.

LearningEvolution Sep26-28
Dear all,
The EvoKE community (Evolutionary Knowledge for
Everyone) had launched a call to organise workshops
during the next EvoKE conference. We at EvoKE seek
to contribute to a world where people understand evo-
lution and can use scientic knowledge and skills to
make informed decisions that address societal prob-
lems thereby contributing to an inclusive, sustainable
and resilient future. EvoKE is a diverse, open commu-
nity that was seeded at theEvoKE 2017 - a successful
meetingthat took place in Porto, Portugal. The next
meeting - EvoKE 2019 - will take place from 26th to
29th September 2019 in Split, Croatia. During these
days, our international and interdisciplinary community
will meet to learn, collaborate and develop creative and
eective education and outreach projects.
We would therefore like to oer workshops and work-
group sessions around ve major topics:
- common misconceptions in evolution and how to deal
with them; - personal communication: training in body
language and persuasive communication, concluding
with a script/screenplay of a short evolutionary stand-
up performance; - how to communicate eectively with
media, and how to engage journalists with evolution-
ary biology work and messages; - how to organize an
outreach event: identifying needs, nding partners and
funders, planning actions and engaging with the public;
- how to evaluate the impact of an outreach event and
use this information to improve it. - producing and eval-
uating educational activities in evolution for dierent
age groups.
Do you have experience or expertise in one of the six
topics listed? Do you have other great ideas that you12 EvolDir March 1, 2019
could oer to the Evoke community not listed above?
Would you like to share your expertise with the EvoKE
community? Then apply to organize one workshop at
EvoKE2019!

Dear colleagues
Just a reminder for our SMBE Satellite Meeting and
Workshop on ^AIdentifying barriers to gene ow in the
genome' to be held 17th-19th June 2019 at the Marine
Biology Laboratory, Tj ~A^Arn~A^A ¶, Sweden. The dead-
line for registering is the 25th February - so there is still
time to sign up!
Speciation genomics is a fast moving and rapidly chang-
ing eld. Genome scans and demographic inference are
popular tools for studying how barriers to gene ow
evolve and how species diverge, but the eld has only
recently begun to take into account confounding factors
that might bias these methods.
If standard approaches are insucient for identifying
barriers to gene ow and understanding the processes
involved in speciation, where do we go next? One way
forward is the use of sophisticated approaches to jointly
infer signals of selection, gene ow and demographic
history. We can also use ecient simulation to introduce
greater statistical rigour to our approaches.
This three day workshop/meeting on speciation ge-
nomics will combine talks from invited speakers and
participants, a discussion panel and a hands-on work-
shop to learn how to use a composite likelihood ap-
proach to infer selection, gene ow and demography
from genome scan data.
Invited speakers include: * Reto Burri (University of
Jena) * Jonna Kulmuni (University of Helsinki) * Kelley
Harris (University of Washington) * Simon Aeschbacher
(University of Zurich) * [Frederic Guillaume (University
of Zurich)
The practical workshop will be led by Jerome
Kelleher (Big Data Institute, Oxford) (the impor-
tance of simulations) and Konrad Lohse (Univer-sity of Edinburgh). Some basic experience in Unix,
and Python programming is necessary but we pro-
vide links to resources on our website: https://-
smbespeciationgenomics.github.io/ There is space for
approximately 40-50 participants. To apply, please
register at https://smbespeciationgenomics.github.io//-
register/. The deadline for applications is 25th February
2019.
It is free to register but attendance will cost $300 (US)
to cover accommodation and food for the three days.
Travel bursaries are available for MSc and PhD students
wishing to attend.
We encourage participants from all backgrounds and
levels to apply and we look forward to welcoming you
to Sweden in June!

CallAbstracts
The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
organizes Europe's largest evolutionary biology confer-
ence every 2nd year. The 17th ESEB congress will be
held from 19-23 August 2019 in Turku, Finland, the
gateway to the Finnish archipelago. There will be ve
plenary speaker, as well as 8 concurrent sessions cover-
ing 35 themed symposium topics (full list below) plus
an open symposium. Each symposium has two invited
speakers plus a number of presenters selected from the
submitted abstracts. There is a cap of 1300 participants.
More details about the congress can be found at https:/-
/eseb2019./ The ESEB2019 call for abstracts is now
open and remain open until 23:59 EET on 31.3.2019
(note that Finland is one hour ahead of central Europe!).
Submitted abstracts can be modied up until the dead-
line, and therefore early submission of rst drafts is
encouraged. The titles of all 36 symposia can be found
at the end of this message. More detailed descriptions
of each symposium and their invited speakers, as well
as the abstract submission system itself can be accessed
via the conference web page:
https://eseb2019./symposia-and-abstracts Each
congress participant is permitted to submit only one
(max. 250 word abstract, max. 15 word title) abstract
as a presenter (co-authorships in other abstracts areallowed). The only exception to this rule is that
participants can submit a second abstract as a presenter
to Symposium 35: Evolution outreach projects: Keep
SCREAMing. Submitters have the opportunity to
select a rst and second preference symposium for their
abstract.
Researchers submitting to Symposium 36: Open Sympo-
sium are encouraged to read the symposium description
for more details about additional information required
when submitting to this symposium. This information
will assist organisers in arranging Open Symposium pre-
sentations into sub-themes not covered by the 35 themed
symposia.
The expected length of presentation slots is 15 min-
utes (10+3+2) for regular presentations and 30 min-
utes (23+5+2) for invited speakers. Due to the tighter
timeline being implemented for abstract submission (in
previous ESEB meetings, abstract submissions closed
in January), there will be no extension to this deadline.
Abstracts will be blind-evaluated by symposium organis-
ers during April. All abstract submitters will be notied
of the fate of their abstract by the end of April, and
those being accepted for oral or poster presentations
are required to register for the congress by May 10. If
they do not register by this date, their talk/poster slot
will be oered to other participants, who will have the
chance to register prior to general earlybird registration
opening on May 15.

Registration is open for The Evolution of Cooperation
and Conict: from theory to experimental evaluation.
Research on conict and cooperation has recently gained
momentum due to major theoretical and genomic break-
throughs that have expanded the research horizon. In-
terestingly, even though the conict and cooperation
communities employ many of the same research tools
and frameworks, they often proceed independently of
each other. Our goal in this conference is to integrate
these two complimentary communities to build new and
productive links between them.
The conference will take place May 21-22 2019 at Upp-

8TH EUROPEAN CONGRESS OF MAMMALOGY
TO BE HELD IN WARSAW, POLAND IN SEPTEM-
BER 2019
The European Congresses of Mammalogy aim to bring
together mammalian biologists from European and alsonon-European countries.
The relaxed and friendly atmosphere of these congresses
provides an excellent opportunity to hear the latest
developments in various elds of mammalogy,
to share research experience and expertise, and to de-
velop new and closer contacts with colleagues from dif-
ferent countries.
Following the successful congresses in Lisbon (1991),
Southampton (1995), Jyv askyl a (1999), Brno (2003),
Siena (2007), Paris (2011) and Stockholm (2015)
it is now the turn of a Central European country to

CNRS Gif
DynamicsTransposableElements
Dear all,
We are looking for a PhD student for this 3-year fully-
funded position in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.
Please apply through the CNRS website https://-
emploi.cnrs.fr/Ores/Doctorant/UMR9191-ARNLER-
001/Default.aspx?lang=EN .
Dynamics of transposable elements : model and biosta-
tistical approaches
* Scientic context
Transposable elements are repeated DNA sequences of-
ten constituting a substantial part of the genome content
[1, 2]. Due to their ability to move and amplify, they
are often considered as \selsh DNA" sequences, which
evolutionary success does not depend on a selective ad-
vantage conferred to the individuals carrying them [3,
4, 5].
Transposable elements are known to jump frequently
across species borders and are able to invade new
genomes after such horizontal transfer events [6]. In-
vasions are fast at the evolutionary scale, and dicult
to track in nature. Yet, it is now possible to repro-
duce them in lab conditions, a procedure known as
experimental evolution [7]. In our lab, a research pro-
gram devoted to the study of transposable element ex-
perimental invasions is being carried out in the modelspecies Drosophila melanogaster. Transposable element
sequences from other species can be articially intro-
duced in the genome of lab ies, and such new element
carriers can be introduced in experimental populations
in which the element is not present. The number, fre-
quency, and location of transposable element copies can
then be followed through molecular biology techniques
[8].
* PhD project
We are looking for a PhD student to focus on the anal-
ysis of these experimental data. The PhD project is
dened along two axes, the rst one corresponding to
the formalization of dynamic models, and the second
one to bioinformatics analysis.
Dynamic, population genetics models will describe the
evolution of the number and the frequency of transpos-
able element copies in populations. They will be based
on traditional models in transposable element popu-
lation genetics [9, 10], and will accomodate recently-
described mechanisms (such as the epigenetic-driven
regulation of transposition through small RNA, [11]).
Models will feature stochastic phenomena (genetic drift,
recombination, mutations, sampling eects), and will
be used for statistical inference of parameters of interest
(such as transposition rates or regulation strength) from
experimental data.
The bioinformatics analysis will deal with the data gen-
erated by sequencing the experimental populations. The
PhD candidate will have to infer new transposable el-
ement insertion sites, as well as their frequencies in
populations. Standard and/or ad-hoc statistical meth-
ods (such as site frequency spectrum analysis) will then
be applied in order to reconstruct the evolution andMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 17
the distribution of transposable elements during genome
invasion.
* Required skills and training
We are looking for a student trained in bioinformat-
ics, statistical methods, and dynamical system analysis.
The PhD candidate should have basic training in com-
puter sciences, including programming (programming
languages used in our research group are R, Python,
and C++). A solid experience in population genetics
or evolutionary biology is also expected. Good level in
written/spoken English is requested.

EvoltutionAntibioticResistance
Spread and evolution of antibiotic resistance encoded
on prophages
ETH Z'rich, Institute of Integrative Biology
Supervisor: Dr. Carolin Wendling
SNSF funded PhD Project (3 years)
The Pathogen Ecology Group at the ETH is oering a
PhD position in the eld of antibiotic resistance evolu-
tion starting from June 2019 at the earliest.
Background:
A worldwide increase of life-threatening antibiotic resis-
tant (AR) pathogens is a major global health problem.
This trend is predicted to increase with ever increasing
misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which accelerates the
evolution of AR. In addition, we are limited in control-
ling the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying
ecological and evolutionary forces. One important mech-
anism of transferring ARGs between dierent bacteria
are temperate bacteriophages (prophages), i.e. viruses
that can incorporate their own genetic material into the
bacterial chromosome, thereby providing their bacte-
rial host (which is now called lysogen) with additional
genes, such as ARGs. However, despite their vast abun-
dance in nature, our understanding of the contribution
of prophages to the spread of AR is still incomplete.
Project description:
In this project we will use experimental populations
of antibiotic susceptible E. coli and antibiotic resistant
E. coli (resistance comes from an integrated prophage).
We will employ a combination of evolution experiments
in dierent environmental conditions, whole genome se-
quencing and microbiology, to unravel the ecological and
evolutionary drivers inuencing the spread of antibiotic
resistance encoded on prophages in real time.
The student will, therefore, be able to acquire a broad
set of lab skills (microbiology and molecular biology)
and analytical techniques (statistics and bioinformatics).
The student will be supervised by Dr. Carolin Wendling
and will be part of the Pathogen Ecology Group, lead
by Prof. Dr. Alex Hall at the ETH Z'rich. ETH
hosts a supportive and vibrant evolutionary microbiol-18 EvolDir March 1, 2019
ogy community and the candidate will have the chance
to interact with many researchers from other groups at
the institute through joint seminars and meetings.
The project will suite a motivated student interested
in using ecology and evolution to study the spread of
drug resistance. Students must hold a Masters degree
(or equivalent), and should have a record of research
projects conducted during or after their previous studies
preferably in the eld of ecology and evolution. Very
good written and spoken English is essential. The candi-
date is expected to work independently and to develop
his/her own project ideas. Experience with either prac-
tical microbiology, molecular biology or bioinformatics
is desirable.
If you are interested please send your application (one
pdf le including CV, brief research interest and con-
tact details of at least two references) to Dr. Car-
olin Wendling (carolin.wendling@env.ethz.ch) until 31th
March 2019.

PhD Studentship to start October 2019
Metagenomics for the bioassessment of water bod-

supervisor: Dr Roger Van-Egmond, Unilever
This is a fantastic opportunity to apply cutting-edge
DNA technologies, outdoor experiments and bioinfor-
matics to advance our knowledge of the eects of pollu-
tion to freshwater ecosystems.
The project is co-funded by BBSRC and Unilever. It is
mainly based at the Silwood Park Campus of Imperial
College London, but will involve working visits at the
Colworth Science Park of Unilever.
Start date: October 2019 (for 4 years)
Water bodies and their resident biodiversity are at risk
from contaminants, disease agents, biological invasions
and abiotic stressors. In the European Union, the Water
Framework Directive is designed to provide the means
to assess, monitor and manage water bodies in order to
ensure safety, economic and natural resources sustain-
ability. Traditionally, biological quality is assessed by
obtaining abundance and diversity measures of existing
communities using morphological methods. There is the
need for conventional approaches to be supplemented
with new technologies as they are time- consuming, some-
times lacking accuracy and needing extensive taxonomic
expertise. Here, we propose to explore new approaches
for the assessment of water bodies, which benet from
the latest development in (eco)metagenomics, bioinfor-
matic and chemical biology. Recent molecular advances,
including the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) ex-
tracted from the water column, is revolutionizing this
eld, by generating novel high through- put data that
could enable us to track and describe focal species as well
as the wider food web within which they are embedded,
and how they respond to external changes.
The student will advance eDNA and metagenomic ap-
proaches using mesocosms available at Imperial College.
Mesocosm-based approaches are increasingly being rec-
ognized as spanning the critical gap between eld obser-
vations and lab experiments, by oering realistic levels
of biocomplexity, whilst also aording a degree of con-
trol and replication of experimental conditions. The
student will assemble articial communities in the meso-
cosms and evolve how eDNA metabarcoding can recover
presence and abundance of those organisms, employing
cutting-edge molecular computational methods to better
exploit metagenomic data and derive maximum value.
Subsequently the student will test how eDNA can be
used to uncover the impact that a range of chemical
stressors may have on these articial communities.
Student Eligibility: The standard BBSRC residency
and Imperial College eligibility criteria still apply (UK
residency or citizenship). Besides a BSc at 2:1 or better,
the student should hold, or expect to obtain, a Mastersdegree (at Merit level or better). However, outstanding
candidates without a Masters may be considered.

Board Bather Protection Programme, South Africa.*
KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (www.shark.co.za) invites
applications for a full-time PhD position to investigate
genetic bottleneck in three batoid species (diamond
ray *Gymnura natalensis*, apnose ray *Rhinoptera
javanica *and spotted eagle ray *Aetobatus narinari*)
along the east coast of South Africa. The position is
funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) for
a maximum of three years (2019-2021) and is available
immediately. Although the NRF gives preference to
local applicants, students from outside of South Africa
are encouraged to apply and will be selected if they
are clearly more qualied than any local applicants,
particularly if one or more of the following criteria ap-
ply: a) a distinction in their previous degree (e.g. MSc
*cum laude*); b) experience with microsatellites or next-
generation sequencing applications and c) at least one
publication in a reputable scientic journal.
This project is part of a multidisciplinary collabora-
tion including Drs Kolobe Mmonwa and Matt Dicken
(KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board), Prof Peter Teske (Uni-
versity of Johannesburg) and Dr Aletta-Bester van der
Merwe (Stellenbosch University). The student will beMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 21
based at the University of Johannesburg or Stellenbosch
University for the duration of the project, with occa-
sional visits to the KwaZulu-Natal Shark Board. There
will be no sampling trips, as all genetic samples have
already been collected.
Remuneration is R (ZAR) 120 000 per year (NRF). A
short summary of the project is included below. In-
terested students should please send a single email to
all the following addresses: pteske101@gmail.com, lu-
cas@shark.co.za and aeb@sun.ac.za. Please include a
short letter of motivation (max. 1 page) in which you
outline relevant interests and skills, a short CV, and
contact details of at least 3 referees (one of which should
be your most recent supervisor or line manager).
*Summary:* The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board deploys
shark nets to protect bathers against shark attacks at
32 popular beaches along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. De-
mographic analyses using catch data between 1979-2015
found that catches of two of the batoids commonly
caught as bycatch in the nets were declining, which may
be attributed to both the nets and to sheries operat-
ing in the western Indian Ocean. This project aims to
investigate genetic signals of population bottleneck of
three batoids using next-generation sequencing meth-
ods. The scientic knowledge produced will be crucial
in providing an objective evaluation of the impact of
shark nets and other factors on batoid population size.

questration, climate regulation, etc.). They are highly
threatened by global changes, especially climate change
and forest degradation. Understanding how tropical
forests respond to these threads is crucial to assess their22 EvolDir March 1, 2019
future, adapt management practices and ensure they
will continue to provide essential ecosystem services.
However, the role of biodiversity in tropical forests re-
sponse to climate variation and anthropogenic distur-
bance remains relatively unexplored. Recent studies
have highlighted the role of biodiversity in forest dy-
namics and functioning. Biotic interactions between
neighboring trees depend on species strategies and can
lead to competitive exclusion of less performant species
and/or to species coexistence through niche dierences.
These complex biotic interactions can inuence tropical
tree response to global changes. A major challenge for
ecologists is to better understand the combined eects
of ecological mechanisms (e.g. environmental ltering
and biotic interactions) on tropical forest dynamics in
the context of global changes.
Project description: The successful applicant will de-
velop and validate an innovative spatially-explicit mod-
elling approach of tropical tree response to combined
eects of biotic interactions with their neighbors and
their abiotic environment (climate and disturbance).
The model will integrate species functional traits and
phylogenetic relationships to study their role in (i) in-
trinsic species performance (growth, mortality), (ii) re-
sponse to abiotic environment (climate and disturbance)
and (iii) response to neighborhood interactions. Models
will use long-term forest monitoring data from the Para-
cou forest research station in French Guiana ( >30 year
of annual/biennial monitoring on >90 ha in disturbed
and undisturbed plots). Functional traits data are avail-
able from previous work conducted by ECOFOG and
AMAP, with some additional measurement of physio-
logical traits related to drought resistance during the
course of the PhD.

Doctoral position Virtuelle Pal aontologie der
Chengjiang-Arthropoden virtual palaeontology of
Chengjiang arthropods
We are seeking a PhD student to take part in the in-
vestigation of early arthropod fossils from the early
Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerst atte using various imag-
ing techniques. The project is funded by the German
Research Foundation (DFG) in the framework of a joint
Sino-German NSFC-DFG research project.
Around 250 fossil species have been reported from the
Chengjiang Lagerst atte. Most of them are exceptionally
well preserved arthropods. This precious fossil material
provides a unique window to understand the origin and
early evolution of this group of animals. The phyloge-
netic positions of many Chengjiang species, however, are
under debate. The main reason is that the morphologies
of those early representatives have not been examined
in greater detail using various visualisation techniques.
In our joint Sino-German research project, advanced
imaging techniques such as micro-CT, uorescence mi-
croscopy and low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy
will be applied to extract the most information and
to visualise the animals' morphologies in a 3D manner.
This project will bring together arthropod specialists
from both countries in a joint research eort.
The prospective PhD student should be a dedicated
'image-maker', preferably with experience in various
imaging techniques and computerized image analyses,
volume exploration and 3D-reconstruction using pro-
grams like VG Studio, Drishti, OsiriX, Blender, Amira
and alike. The applicant does not necessarily need to
have experience with all the imaging methods but is ex-
pected to gain expertise early in the course of the project.
The results of the project are expected to be presented
regularly at national and international conferences by
the prospective PhD student as well as published in24 EvolDir March 1, 2019
peer-reviewed journals.
The successful candidate will be based in the work group
\Arthropoda varia" at the Bavarian State Collection of
Zoology, but will also use the facilities of the Zoomor-
phology workgroup at the LMU Biocenter Martinsried.
For material reasons, the successful candidate will be
required to regularly visit the collaborators in Yunnan
Key Laboratory for Palaeobiology, Yunnan University,
Kunming, China.
We oer: DFG-funded PhD position (65%) for 36
months; interdisciplinary research project and work-
ing environment; modern imaging equipment (macro-
and microscopic).
We expect: MSc (or equivalent) in Zoology/Biology or
Palaeobiology; good English communication skills (oral
and written); ability to work in teams; high motivation;
keen interest in evolutionary biology and life of the past.
The position is limited to 36 months with a presumed
starting date of May 01, 2019.
Applications of women are strongly encouraged.
Severely challenged persons will be given preference
in case of otherwise equal qualications.
Please send your application to melzer@snsb.de before
March 15, 2019. The application should include CV,
transcript of records, letter of motivation and the names
and contact details of potential referees.

Grant Call" launched by the Portuguese Science and
Technology Foundation (FCT). *The call closes on the
28**th **of March (5pm). *The successful candidate(s)
will write and submit a grant proposal to this FCT call,
working closely with both project supervisors.
*Background *
The Gola Rainforest National Park (GRNP) is a largely
continuous area of Tropical Rainforest located in south-
east Sierra Leone and north-west Liberia. It is one of
the last remnants of the Upper Guinean Forests that
once stretched across West Africa, and is an exception
to the agricultural-forest mosaic that is observed across
neighbouring countries. Despite civil war and the Ebola
outbreak, the GRNP remains a signicant biodiversity
hotspot for at least 49 species of large-bodied mam-
mal, including a diversity of primates. In Sierra Leone,
the reserve is bordered by 122 forest edge communities
which use forest resources and cultivate cocoa. InitialMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
assessments indicate heavy hunting pressure from the
Liberian side.
Western chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes verus*) are crit-
ically endangered with habitat disturbance and hunting
posing a severe threat to their long-term conservation.
The GRNP lies at the centre of western chimpanzee
distribution, and has the potential to harbor long-term
viable populations of this threatened great ape. Despite
an expanse of continuous primary forest at GRNP, ini-
tial assessments suggest a low density of chimpanzees.
There are no quantitative data on the ecological fac-
tors (e.g. food abundance, habitat characteristics) and
anthropogenic factors (e.g. bushmeat hunting, habitat
conversion) that determine chimpanzee population size
and their spatio-temporal distribution at GRNP.
*Research Project Goals *
Although Research Projects 1 & 2 are complementary,
they require dierent skillsets. We will develop specic
aims and methods with the successful candidate(s), who
will also be encouraged to develop their own ideas.
The overarching goal for *Research Project 1 *is to es-
timate chimpanzee abundance and population size at
GRNP, and determine the anthropogenic and ecological
factors that impact the presence, distribution, ranging
and grouping patterns of chimpanzees at GRNP. We an-
ticipate this project will involve extensive on-the-ground
surveys and monitoring using camera traps, as well as
remote sensing analyses. Chimpanzee fecal samples will
also be collected for genetic/genomic analyses. This po-
sition requires extensive experience conducting eldwork
under challenging conditions; attested ability to work
alongside local communities; previous research experi-
ence with wild primates and especially with great apes
will be considered favourably; experience in the proposed
data collection methods and analysis. The candidate
should be uent in written and spoken English.
The goal for the *Research Project 2 *is to use bioa-
coustics and systems-based modelling/other mathemat-
ical approaches (e.g. individual species recognition al-
gorithms) to determine long-term wildlife (including
chimpanzee) presence and distribution across GRNP.
Although the candidate is expected to spend some time
setting up recording devices in GRNP, there is the possi-
bility of employing a research assistant for the eldwork
component. This is a more data-driven position and the
candidate must be experienced in appropriate mathe-
matical data analysis. The candidate should be uent
in written and spoken English.
*Requirements for the PhD position *
FCT oers a contract of up to four years with a monthly
salary of e980 (tax exempt) plus payment of tuition fees.The candidate will be based between GRNP and CRIA,
in Lisbon, with the opportunity to visit Exeter Univer-
sity to carry part of the data analysis. The candidate

Project Description
We are looking for an excellent PhD student to com-
mence in 2019 on a project associated with two Aus-March 1, 2019 EvolDir 27
tralian Research Council grants examining evolution
and adaptation in tiger snakes.
The candidate should have a strong interest in evolution-
ary biology (including the eld of molecular evolution)
and the natural history of reptiles. They will join a
vibrant research team of Australian and international
researchers, based at the University of Adelaide, that
is focused on the diversity and evolution of Australian
snakes.
The candidate will be supervised by Dr. Vicki Thomson
and will be based at the South Australian Regional
Facility for Molecular Ecology and Evolution at the
University of Adelaide.
Project summary: This project examines the geographic
variation amongst tiger snakes in anatomy, ecology, and
life history traits, and the relationship of these factors
to venom toxins and production. The tiger snake is a
unique system showing evolution/adaptation of multi-
ple traits across island populations, including body size,
head size plasticity, venom evolution, scale colouration
etc. The project, which will be developed with the stu-
dent, can be developed to examine island evolution in
a range of traits, which could include the evolution of
venom toxin genes that play critical roles in adaptation
to dierent prey items on the islands, regulation of genes
involved in plasticity of head size, evolution of genes
involved in growth that results in gigantism or dwarsm
etc. We have recently generated two genomes of tiger
snakes, so these resources will be available to examine
genes known to be involved in growth, metabolism, pig-
mentation etc. As part of this project, the candidate will
develop skills in genomic DNA and RNAseq analyses,
including next-generation sequencing and the associated
bioinformatics.

UEdinburgh SexDetermination
Dear all,
I am looking for a talented and enthusiastic evolutionary
or molecular biologist for a fully funded (ERC) 4-year
PhD position in my lab http://lauraross.bio.ed.ac.uk
at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of
Edinburgh.
ERC funded PhD project: Evolution in a y with weird
sex
Project background In most animals, sex is determinedMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 29
by sex chromosome inheritance. For example in mam-
mals, those embryos that inherit a Y chromosome from
their fathers become male, while those that inherit a
X chromosome become female. However, many species
determine the sex of their ospring in rather dierent
ways. Why these alternative means of determining sex
evolved and what molecular mechanisms guide them
is an important outstanding question [1]. This project
focuses on understanding the evolution and molecu-
lar mechanisms of one such alternative sex determining
strategy: in some ies sex is determined by genes carried
by the mother not the ospring. Mothers are genetically
pre-determined to either only produce daughters or only
sons. Earlier studies have found that a region on the
X-chromosome is responsible [2,3], but how it alters
ospring sex and how it evolved remains unclear. New
genomic data for the rst time allow us to address these
questions and increase our understanding of the diverse
array of sex determining mechanism found across the
tree of life.
Key research questions The aim of this project is to
understand how genes expressed in the mother act to de-
termine ospring sex and how, why and when it evolved
in the evolutionary history of this group of insects.
Methodology and Training This project will combine
laboratory experiments, gene expression and genome
analyses. A comprehensive training programme will be
provided comprising both specialist scientic training
and generic transferable and professional skills. Speci-
cally the student will undertake training in the use of
molecular wet lab techniques, the analysis of sequencing
data and designing large-scale experiments.
Requirements and eligibility Candidates must be highly
motivated with a keen interest in evolutionary biology
and genetics and a strong motivation to pursue a scien-
tic career. Previous experience with genetic techniques,
and bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing anal-
yses would be an advantage. Only UK or EU citizens
are eligible to apply.
Application Application for this position is open until
the 15th of March 2019. For more information and
instructions on how to apply please email me directly

EcoEvolutionaryDynamics
University of Konstanz: two PhD positions Eco-
Evolutionary Dynamics
Two PhD positions are available to study eco-
evolutionary dynamics and environmental changes with
the Aquatic Ecology and Evolution group headed by
Prof. Lutz Becks at the University of Konstanz.
* Eco-evolutionary dynamics and evolutionary facilita-
tion* Project Description: Eco-evolutionary dynamics
are important for ecological and evolutionary processes
as they can determine coexistence of species and their
biomasses as well as local adaptation and intraspecic
trait diversity and polymorphism. Little is known, how-
ever, when and how the eco-evolutionary feedback be-
tween population and trait dynamics contributes to
buering external perturbations. Combining modelling
and experiments, we aim developing and testing general
theory on how the interplay of ecological and trait dy-
namics allow systems to buer external perturbations.
We will study the eects of external perturbations on
a predator of a predator-prey system with and without
the possibility for eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics.
Specically, we will test the prediction that increased
predator mortality and decreased predator growth rates
due to an environmental change can be buered in-
directly through adaptations in the prey population.
This project is in close collaboration with colleagues
form the University Potsdam (Prof. Ursula Gaedke),
Tokyo University (Prof. Masato Yamamichi) and Utah
State University (Prof. Michael Cortez), and is part of
the DFG funded priority program Dynatrait (https://-32 EvolDir March 1, 2019
www.dynatrait.de/).
*Relative role of viruses for phytoplankton control*
Project Description: Eco-evolutionary dynamics are im-
portant for ecological and evolutionary processes as they
can determine coexistence of species and their biomasses
as well as local adaptation and intraspecic trait diver-
sity and polymorphism. This project aims to understand
the relative roles of aquatic viruses and zooplankton for
controlling phytoplankton dynamics in changing environ-
ments and whether and how evolution modies compe-
tition and coexistence between viruses and zooplankton.
We plan to use microcosm experiments in combination
with modelling to study the importance of rapid evolu-
tionary changes and eco-evolutionary dynamics. We are
particularly interested in understanding the resilience
of consumer-resource systems to eutrophication. This
project is integrated in the Research Training Group
R3 (www.rtg-resilience.uni-konstanz.de) and funded by
the German Academic Exchange Service DAAD.
Application: Highly motivated candidates with a MSc
degree in evolutionary biology or ecology are welcome
to apply. Applicants should have a background in evo-
lutionary theory or population dynamics and show an
enthusiasm for basic research and ideally experience
in working with plankton or microbial systems. The
successful candidate should be able to communicate
eectively with individuals from a wide range of dis-
ciplines. For the project Relative role of viruses for
phytoplankton control please follow the incrustations un-

UOtago EvolutionSensoryPerception
*PhD position in evolutionary physiology at the Univer-
sity of Otago*
Michael Garratt at the University of Otago is recruiting
a PhD student to work in conjunction with a Marsdenfunded project, addressing the role of sensory perception
in control of mammalian life-history.
Project Description: Life history theory is built on the
assumption that there are trade-os between life-history
traits, such as between early and late-life reproduction,
and between reproduction and lifespan. How these
trade-os are mediated is poorly understood. The cur-
rent PhD will test new hypotheses suggesting sensory
perception is an important trigger of life-history invest-
ment and aging, focusing on the role of olfaction in the
mouse as a model system. The project will make use
of mice with genetic decits that limit the ability to
detect certain pheromones, in addition to conducting
social manipulations where the perception of mates and
competitors is altered. The candidate will work in con-
junction with a funded Marsden project, and there will
be scope to shape the project in relation to the appli-
cant's interests. This could include uncovering novel
components of life history that are shaped by sensory
signals, exploring trade-os between early and late-life
traits, and identication of neuroendocrine signals that
link sensory cues to altered life-history investment.
The student will be under supervision of Dr. Michael
Garratt, whose interests lie in understanding the links
between reproduction and aging. The Department of
Anatomy at the University of Otago has diverse and com-
plimentary research interests, including research groups
focusing on reproduction, genomics, development, neu-
roscience, neuroendocrinology, clinical anatomy and bio-
logical anthropology. The University of Otago is located
in the beautiful town of Dunedin in the South Island of
New Zealand.
Interested applicants should contact Michael Garratt,
including their CV, academic transcript and evidence of
English language test if required. PhD Scholarships are
available to international students, but students must
apply and be awarded a doctoral scholarship from the
Department of Anatomy or University of Otago schol-
arship programs. These scholarships provide a tuition
waiver and a tax-free stipend.

ButteryEvolutionaryGenetics
*PhD-position in evolutionary genetics at Uppsala Uni-
versity*
A 4-year PhD-position in evolutionary genetics is avail-
able in the research group of Dr. Niclas Backstr ~A^Aat
the Department of Evolutionary Biology in Uppsala,
Sweden. Starting date in May 2019 or as agreed upon.
The successful applicant will work with population ge-
nomic analysis using whole-genome re-sequencing data
from several populations and species, gene expression
analysis and management of buttery populations for
eg. crossing and linkage mapping experiments.
Project description: Getting detailed understanding
about mechanisms of reproductive isolation between
diverging lineages is one of the major challenges in
evolutionary biology. In the research group, we use
wood white butteries as a model system and combine
experimental work with bioinformatic analyses to in-
vestigate the genetic underpinnings of barriers to gene
ow and traits that may play a role in species recog-
nition, mate choice and local adaptation. The project
will mostly involve bioinformatic handling of large data
sets. The main focus will be on understanding the role
of sex-chromosomes in speciation and adaptation and
investigating the evolutionary consequences of variation
in recombination rate across populations with distinct
karyotypes and between chromosomal regions. Depend-
ing on the personal interests and qualications of the
candidate, the project can also be extended to address
other questions in molecular evolution / evolutionary ge-
nomics. At a later stage, the candidate may also choose
to participate in other projects that are currently devel-
oping in the lab. For any further questions, please visit

PhD-position in evolutionary genetics at Uppsala Uni-
versity
A 4-year PhD-position in evolutionary genetics is avail-
able in the research group of Dr. Arild Husby at the
Evolutionary Biology, Department of Ecology and Ge-
netics in Uppsala, Sweden. Starting date in April 2019
or as agreed upon. The successful applicant will work
with large scale genomic data from a house sparrow
metapopulation in Norway (whole genome resequenc-
ing data, 4000 SNP genotyped individuals, extensive
phenotypic database) to understand genomics of local
adapation.
Project description: The candidate will use phenotypic
and genomic data from a long-term study population
of a house sparrow metapopulation ( >3000 individuals
genotyped on a 200K SNP array and >30 individuals
with whole genome sequences combined with a very
extensive phenotypic database) to look for signs of se-
lection in the genome, estimate demographic patterns
and examine structural variation. A central goal will be
to understand the connection between genetic variants
linked to phenotypic traits and their patterns of selec-
tion in the genome. The project is in collaboration with
the Centre of Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD) at NTNU,
Norway and the candidate is expected to spend periods
of time at CBD and also take part in eldwork.

AntarcticSeabirdGenetics
Project description:
Knowledge of species' responses to past climate change
can be used to predict their resilience to current and
projected climate change. However, species have vary-
ing sensitivity to environmental stressors. Therefore, to
identify which species track the impact of environmen-
tal change in the past, with a view to monitoring in
the present and predicting the future, we must assess a
variety of taxa.
This project addresses a key knowledge gap for Antarctic
biota by genetically assessing responses of six ighted
seabird species to past climate change, and combin-
ing these with inferences already made for penguins
and seals in a meta-analysis. Knowledge of the spatial
distribution of genetic variation can also guide the selec-
tion of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas through the
identication of populations that are demographically-
independent, represent long-term refugia, or contain
genetic (and potentially taxonomic) novelty.
This study will exploit existing tissue resources using
genomic SNP (ddRAD seq) data to address these ques-
tions.
Applying: We seek a PhD student to conduct this re-
search at the University of Tasmania. The student will
be supervised by Assoc. Prof. Chris Burridge (UTas)
and Drs Barbara Wienecke and Louise Emmerson (Aus-
tralian Antarctic Division, also located in Tasmania).
The applicant will need a track record consistent with
the ability to attract a PhD scholarship covering both
fees and living expenses. It is most likely that the
student will apply for scholarship support from the
University of Tasmania, but candidates able to source
scholarship support externally will be viewed favourably.
Applicants must already have been awarded a Masters
research degree or rst-class Honours degree. Publi-
cation(s) in a relevant eld signicantly increases the
competitiveness of applicants.
Applicants must be able to demonstrate strong research
and analytical skills, including the implementation and
interpretation of population genetics analyses.Enquiries should be sent by e-mail to

Doctoral candidate position in the project \Cooperation,
Evolution and Resource Management" (URL of this
announcement: https://luhaproject.wordpress.com/-
2019/02/01/four-year-doctoral-candidate-position-
second-call/)
Our project funded by the Kone Foundation tests the ap-
plicability of evolutionary models to the study of human
decision-making processes in the context of natural re-
source management. Our approach is interdisciplinary,
and combines research questions and methodologies
from both social and natural sciences. An important
methodology shared by the two disciplines is the game
theoretical approach. In the global scale there has been
a shift from the Tragedy of Commons approach to the
Drama of Commons approach with a more optimistic
view on the capacity of local stakeholders to solve prob-
lems related to common pool resource management. We
are mainly interested to nd out in what circumstances
a stable local common pool resource management might
succeed. Our empirical focus will be on the management
of Finnish sh and game resources, reindeer pastures
and common forests. A more theoretical focus is nd-
ing the key dierences and commonalities between the
theories used in dierent elds.
Duties: We recruit a doctoral candidate who would
cooperate in data collection, statistical analyses and
writing articles with the aim to produce an article-based
PhD thesis. Data will be extracted from the long-term
datasets collected by Finnish national research insti-
tutions (mainly Statistics Finland, Natural ResourcesMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 37
Institute Finland, Finnish Environment Institute, The
Finnish Wildlife Agency, Finnish Forest Centre, Rein-
deer Herders' Association) and their local oces. For
specic research questions interview studies will be per-
formed. An important theoretical framework through-
out the project will be the Social Ecological Systems
(SES) theory developed by Elinor Ostrom and her co-
researchers.
Qualications: Essential qualications are: (1) An MSc
or equivalent degree, for example in (evolutionary) biol-
ogy, economy or some of the social sciences, (2) Experi-
ence of quantitative methods and statistics, (3) A gen-
uine and preferably documented interest in combining
(evolutionary) biology with a wider societal perspective.
Desired qualications are: (a) Strong statistical skills,
(b) Experience in working with public databases, (c) A
willingness to learn new methodologies or approaches
also from other disciplines. Knowledge of Finnish is not
a requirement but is considered an asset as most of the
data will be sources in Finnish.

Dear All,
I would like to draw your attention to an exciting PhD
project on comparative genomics of sh, at Wageningen
University, The Netherlands.
(text and link to apply available online: https://-

in-the-area-of-functional-and-comparative-genomics-in-
sh-health-and-immunology.htm)
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate, with
a clear interest in one or more of the following research
elds: epigenomics/genomics, bioinformatics, health
and immunology, and comparative biology. The PhD
will be employed at a newly funded H2020 project
AQUA-FAANG, aiming to support the global Func-
tional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG) con-
sortium, with a focus on domesticated sh species. How
are traits of animals encoded in their genomes, and how
is that code triggered to become active? To help an-
swer those questions, AQUA-FAANG aims to generate
a wealth of functional genomic (e.g. expression) and
epigenomic (e.g. chromatin structure) data from six
sh species, including Atlantic salmon, sea bass, andMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 39
common carp, for dierent organs and developmental
stages. Special emphasis lies on sh health, as this is
a major concern for economic loss and animal welfare
in aquaculture. Cells and tissues involved in immune
response can be easily studied, and easily triggered, and
therefore serve as a good biological ^Amodel trait'. Since
there are so many economically important sh species,
a comparative genomic approach will be applied to iden-
tify common themes in the functional genomics of sh
health, such as how immune responses are regulated
across species. Special emphasis will lie on the role of
whole genome duplications, that have occurred several
times throughout the evolution of the bony shes.
All candidates should meet the following requirements:
A Master's degree in a relevant biological eld (ge-
nomics/epigenomics, bioinformatics, computational bi-
ology, comparative biology, immunology, or evolutionary
biology), or in a quantitative eld (statistics, data ana-
lytics).
The candidate should have:
- A proven anity for computational analysis (e.g. ex-
perience with Python, R, Linux). - A strong interest in
functional genomic and comparative/evolutionary bio-
logical analysis - A strong interest in fundamental and
applied research. - Be creative and innovative.Good
organisational and (written and spoken) communication
- skills in English, as well as a proven ability to collabo-
rate with others. - Willingness to travel internationally,
to attend international project meetings and conferences
and visit other institutes.

EvolAntibioticResistance
PhD student antimicrobial resistance The organisation:
Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) is one of
the research institutes of the Animal Sciences Group
of Wageningen University & Research. Research is con-
ducted here on health and infectious diseases through
diagnostics, monitoring programmes, fundamental re-
search, clinical studies, epidemiology and risk manage-
ment. WBVR is appointed as National Reference Lab-
oratory for antimicrobial resistance in animals and is
an active research group within the AMR eld. Ongo-
ing monitoring activities are combined with a variety
of research projects. The group consists of two senior
research scientists, one junior scientist and four techni-
cians all working closely together to cover the dierent
tasks and disciplines.
About the PhD project: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
is a topic of great concern in both veterinary and human
medicine. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)
producing bacteria have emerged globally in livestock
and as a consequence, animals (especially poultry) are40 EvolDir March 1, 2019
considered a putative source of ESBLs for humans. Al-
though the actual attribution of AMR from livestock
to public health remains a subject of debate, it is de-
sirable to reduce ESBLs in livestock. Strategies to
achieve this are a topic of current research. Broilers
are often colonised by ESBL-producing bacteria even
in the absence of selective pressure. It is hypothesised
that animals are more at risk for colonisation when the
gut microbiome is still under development. ESBLs and
other AMR genes are often encoded on plasmids that
are transferred between bacteria resulting in the spread
of resistance within a population.
The aim of the PhD project is to study the microbiome
of broilers at farms throughout the production cycle to
determine the optimal age for implementing intervention
strategies and to develop novel intervention strategies.
To ll the gap between lab tests and animal experiments,
an in vitro chicken gut model will be set up and tested
in collaboration with colleagues at the Animal and Plant
Health Agency (APHA, UK). The model simulates the
microbiome of broilers in a laboratory environment and
will be used to study intervention strategies to prevent
colonisation of ESBL-producing bacteria. These strate-
gies will include various feed additives such as organic
acids, prebiotics and probiotics. Furthermore, the model
will be used to test intervention strategies to prevent
the transfer of AMR-plasmids within the microbiome.
Data gained from both the animal microbiome and the
in vitro gut model will aid in our understanding of the
dissemination of AMR in broiler farms with the aim
of reducing AMR prevalence in livestock, ultimately
reducing the risk of AMR spreading from livestock to
the human population.
The project will be carried out in close collaboration
with Prof. Arjan de Visser, Laboratory of Genetics, Wa-
geningen University, who will act as academic promotor.Requirements
Meet the requirements of Wageningen University for ad-
mittance as PhD (appropriate MSc and English skills).
MSc in Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Evolutionary

Collections Manager, NEON Biorepository - Environ-
mental & Zoological Samples (Research Specialist)
The Arizona State University (ASU) School of Life Sci-
ences is seeking a Collections Manager for the National
Ecological Observatory Network Biorepository (NEON
- https://www.neonscience.org/). This project is ex-
pected to run for 30 years. For each project year, the
NEON Biorepository at ASU will receive, process, and
make available for research an average of 100,000 bio-
diversity occurrences sampled at more than 80 sites
across the United States. We will facilitate this by
creating a data portal to support occurrence discovery
and tracking of sample transactions and usage statis-
tics. The collections manager will play a critical role in
coordinating these tasks by focusing on a diverse suite
of environmental and zoological samples that include:
thousands of frozen and room temperature-preserved
soil samples, wet depositions from terrestrial sites, mi-
crobial samples; and furthermore, an array of zoological
samples - primarily arthropods (insects, arachnids) and
vertebrate samples or specimens (e.g., mammals, sh).
The position is therefore relatively broad in scope, and
will complement existing positions focused primarily
on managing cryo and invertebrate collections. Can-
didates who consider themselves capable of handlingthe environmental samples and also have a zoological
(in-/vertebrate) concentration that would complement
existing strengths of the NEON Biorepository team, are
strongly encouraged to apply. An ability to develop
new data products to leverage the research potential of
environmental/zoological NEON Biorepository samples
with the greater community is highly desired. Inquiries
can be directed to nico.franz@asu.edu .
Envisioned start date: April 1st, 2019.

4r Naturkunde Berlin is
currently establishing an internationally visible \Cen-
ter for Integrative Biodiversity Discovery" to meet the
scientic and societal demands arising from the global
biodiversity crisis and the need to secure the future of
'System Earth'. The center will develop new scientic ap-
proaches to the study of biodiversity that will contribute
to a more ecient and signicantly faster global biodiver-
sity inventory and at the same time enable high-quality
taxonomic research on extinct and recent organisms.
We are seeking a taxonomist/biodiversity researcher to
develop and support the new \Center for Integrative Bio-
diversity Discovery" at the Museum f ~A^A1
4r Naturkunde
Berlin ' Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity
Science. The jobholder is expected to take a leading role
in the development of concepts for accelerating the pro-
cess of biodiversity discovery and taxonomic workows
in order to overcome the 'taxonomic impediment' for the
Center, to co-ordinate research activities across working
groups, and to conduct own respective research in this
eld. To this purpose, she/he will bring her/his own
research agenda in the eld of integrative biodiversity
discovery of insects, which should be embedded in the re-
search program of the Center for Integrative Biodiversity
Discovery. Both tasks involve engagement in grant ap-
plications as well as training and supervision of studentsand junior researchers. We also expect active participa-
tion in public outreach activities of the museum about
biodiversity and biodiversity discovery. The Museum
f~A^A1
4r Naturkunde Berlin provides an excellent research
environment. It houses state-of-the-art laboratories for
morphology (including histology, imaging, SEM, and
^ACT labs), molecular genetics/genomics and computa-
tion. Numerous research groups are working in a wide
range of research elds including population genetics,
phylogenetics, developmental and evolutionary genetics,
and taxonomy. Our world-class zoological collections
provide unique access to specimens collected over the
last 200+ years.
Requirements: PhD in biology/zoology and proven
record of postdoctoral experience as a taxonomist in
collection-based biodiversity research on a species-rich
group of insects. Strong experience in and strong gen-
eral knowledge of integrative biodiversity discovery and
taxonomic research as well as experience in taxonomy
related workows (proven by a strong publication record,
which must include taxonomic studies). Demonstrated
success in obtaining third party funding and experi-
ence in leading a research group, ideally experience
in leading international collaborative research projects.
Field work experience, preferably also in larger collab-
orative projects, is expected; research in one of MfN's
geographic focus regions (Southeast Asia, Africa) is de-
sirable. Successful candidates will be expected to work
in a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary environment
at Germany's largest natural history museum. The ideal
candidate should have a strong knowledge of interdisci-
plinary and innovative research approaches beyond the
own eld of expertise (e.g. between biology, pharmacy,
or medicine). Excellent team player, proven communi-
cation skills and intercultural competence. Professional
written and verbal communication in English.

The Martin Fish Speciation Lab seeks an enthusiastic
and detail-oriented lab manager for research on the
rapid evolution and ecological diversication of new
sh species. Primary responsibilities will involve caring
for laboratory colonies of pupsh and Cameroon cich-
lids, molecular genetics, behavioral observations, and
specimen curation in the Museum of Vertebrate Zool-
ogy. Tasks include daily feeding and maintenance of
the sh colonies, construction of recirculating aquatic

to a single Bahamian island despite thousands of simi-
lar Caribbean environments. Our lab also investigates
Cameroon crater lake cichlids, one of the most cele-
brated examples of sympatric speciation in nature, and
the role of gene ow in their diversication. Many of
these species are now critically endangered and propa-
gated in our sh colonies.
Education and Experience required:
We are seeking applicants with strong attention to de-
tail who are thorough, well-organized, and able to work
both independently and collaboratively on a team of
other researchers. Preferred qualications include a B.S.
or B.A. in Biology (or related eld) and either some
animal care experience or molecular training. However,
no previous research experience is necessary; on-the-job
training will be provided for all tasks. The successful
applicant will enjoy caring for animals in an unstress-
ful and exible work environment. The lab managerwill also be fully integrated into all lab meetings and
social events as a member of the team. Those with
a passion for sh and possible interest in applying to
graduate school are strongly encouraged to apply. For
more information on our research, please check out our
website http://labs.bio.unc.edu/martin/ . Salary: This
will initially be an hourly position with the possibility
for a permanent sta position after one year. For recent
graduates, this will be approximately $17-19 per hour.
Work schedule is exible and includes some weekend sh
care responsibilities, but should be approximately 40
hours per week. Part-time, over-time, and permanent
salary position requests are also an option.
Start date: July 1, 2019. This position is for one year
with the potential for a permanent sta position for
another three years.
To apply, please email Chris Martin
(chmartin@berkeley.edu) by March 4th with your
resume/CV, GPA, and describe why you are interested
in this position, career goals, and any past research
or animal care experience. Please note that the lab

SexRoleEvolution
Call for collaboration: Sex role evolution: testing the
impacts of ecology, demography and genes
Sex roles (i.e., courtship, competition for mates, pair
bonding and parenting) are among the most diverse
social behaviour. Recent research is uncovering key ele-
ments of sex role variation, but signicant gaps remain.
Appropriate sexual behaviour is essential for reproduc-
tion, and thus understanding the causes and implications
of sex roles are at the core of evolutionary biology and
fundamental for the study of life history evolution, physi-
ology and population biology. Understanding sex roles is
also important for biodiversity conservation since disrup-
tions to normal sexual behaviour due to environmental
changes reduce the viability of wild populations.
Our team has been recently awarded an ELVONAL
project of Hungarian Science Foundation to investigate
sex role evolution in shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers and
allies). The project is based at University of Debrecen
(Hungary), and will be carried out between 2018 and
2022. Shorebirds exhibit an unusual diversity of sex
role variation, and they provided some of the textbook
examples of mating behaviour, parenting and breeding
systems. Provisional results suggest that some of this
variation is related to adult sex ratios, i.e. the ratios of
adult males to adult females in the local population.
To achieve the objectives of this ambitious project, we
are seeking collaborators willing to study behaviour,
ecology and/or demography of any breeding shorebird
population on the planet. To progress, we have de-
veloped a data collection protocol that explains eld
methodology to gather the information we are seeing
in this project. We hope the ELVONAL project will
lead to joint research publications, and in addition, to
exchange of ideas, discussions and follow-up research.
We also anticipate that our project will have training
and capacity building components, and will impact on
conservation for the benets of shorebirds and people
worldwide.

CU Boulder REU
AlpineEvolutionaryEcol
The Doak lab at CU Boulder and the Morris lab at
Duke University are recruiting two motivated under-
graduates for a summer research internship in alpine
plant evolution and ecology as part of NSF's Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The
students will design and conduct independent research
that contributes to a larger NSF-funded project to in-
vestigate how demographic variation across geographic
ranges determines species range limits and responses to
climate change. To answer this question, we have been
conducting a long-term, multi-site study of the demog-
raphy and owering phenology of two widely distributed
and well-studied herbaceous perennial tundra plants,
moss campion (Silene acaulis) and bisort (Polygonum
viviparum). The REU students can combine short-term
experimental or observational eld studies with 15+
years of existing demographic data, spanning multiple
populations, habitat types, and geographic regions, to
ask compelling questions about the ecology or evolution
of alpine plants. Examples of excellent questions that
REU students could address include:
* How do changing climate conditions (snowmelt, tem-
perature) inuence the timing of owering and pollina-
tors? * Studies of pollination limitation for plants in
female or hermaphrodite- dominated subpopulations of
the gynodioecious Silene acaulis * Evidence for up or
down-slope range expansion of either species in response
to climate change * Impacts of plant neighborhood
structure on growth and survival * Studies of these or
other species across local elevational gradients, to as-
sess changes in form or population structure that would
correspond to or arise from demographic shifts.
The REU students will be based at the Mountain Re-
search Station at Niwot Ridge, CO from June 1 to
August 3, 2019 (the main owering and growth season).
Staying at the Mountain Research Station will allow the
student to engage in rigorous eld work at Niwot Ridge,
take advantage of long-term research plots, and interact
with other REU students and researchers. In addition,
the student will be able to supplement eld research
at Niwot Ridge with trips to nearby alpine areas and
other greenhouse or computer modeling work at CU
Boulder. In late July, the student will also participate
in the main project by collecting demographic data inlong-term plots at Niwot Ridge and New Mexico.
We will provide the REU student with travel expenses,
room and board at the Mountain Research Station, and
a $400/week stipend. We will also provide support for re-
search expenses, including materials or research-related
travel.
The ideal candidate will be interested in pursuing a
career in ecology, environmental sciences, or evolution-
ary biology, and have demonstrated abilities in critical
thinking, organization, and working as part of a team.
Candidates should have some background in ecology,
environmental sciences, or evolution, and the ability
and willingness to engage in physically strenuous or
uncomfortable activities (e.g., hiking at high elevation,
carrying heavy packs, working outdoors under a vari-
ety of weather conditions, etc.). Candidates must be
enrolled in an undergraduate program at the time of
the REU (i.e., students that graduate prior to the pro-
gram are not eligible). Students from underrepresented
backgrounds (rst-generation college students, women,
minorities, etc.) are especially encouraged to apply!
Applications should include: 1) copy of unocial tran-
scripts, 2) contact information for two professors or other
academic references who have agreed to be references
for the applicant, 3) CV, and 4) a one-page description
of your academic background and goals, your interest
in the REU position, any previous research experience,
and any experience working or hiking at high elevations.
Applications and letters should be sent to Dr. Megan Pe-
terson at megan.peterson@colorado.edu with '2019 REU
application' in the subject line. Review of applications
will begin March 15.

MolecularEcolPrize Nominations
Nominations for Molecular Ecology Prize
We are soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular
Ecology Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scientic
society, so there is no body that actively promotes the
discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial board
of the journal Molecular Ecology therefore created the
Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void, and
recognize signicant contributions to this area of re-
search. The prize selection committee is independent of
the journal and its editorial board.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to Molecular Ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previous
winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf , Louis Bernatchez,
Nancy Moran, and Robin Waples.70 EvolDir March 1, 2019
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words; longer submis-
sions will not be accepted) directly to Robin Waples
(robinw3@uw.edu) by Tuesday, April 2, 2019. Organized
campaigns to submit multiple nominations for the same
person are not necessary and can be counterproductive.
Also, note that nominations from previous years do not
roll over.

mtDNA PopGenetics
Dear Colleagues,
Has anyone ever used mitochondrial tRNA sequences to
investigate population dierentiation or species delimi-
tation?
I have some tRNA sequences resulting from the sequenc-
ing of a mitochondrial gene and I was wondering if they
could be informative in terms of population structure
and species dierence. What strategies and methods
have worked (or not) in your experience?
I'll be happy to share results in this mailing list.

My original question:
Has anyone ever used mitochondrial tRNA sequences to
investigate population dierentiation or species delimi-
tation?
I have some tRNA sequences resulting from the sequenc-
ing of a mitochondrial gene and I was wondering if they
could be informative in terms of population structure
and species dierence. What strategies and methods
have worked (or not) in your experience?
Replies I got:I do not think that mtDNA is very wise for population
genetics analyses, for dierent good reasons:

Microsatellite markers will be much more informative
and accurate
|{
Mitochondrial tRNAs tend to be highly conserved within
species and between closely related species (they're less
variable than mitochondrial protein-coding genes, for ex-
ample), but you might get lucky and nd a few variable
sites that could be informative.
|{
To my knowledge the mitochondrial tRNA are not show-
ing polymorphism. I sequenced one tRNA between COI
and COII for hundreds of individuals and did not nd
any polymorphism in this region. If you nd some, I
will be interested by this.

|{
In my opinion, you should use your tRNA sequences just
like any other (haploid) marker, preferably keeping it at-
tached to the neighboring mitochondrial gene you were
targeting for sequencing (since these markers are linked,
it makes no sense to analyze them separately). See

of the dierent approaches you could use for species
delimitation.
|{
tRNAs and tRNA \pseudogenes" can be very useful, as
dierent regions are subjected to very dierent selec-
tion pressures. So, when using them, you should make
very thorough investigations of the sequence blocks you
end up using and the secondary structures. Check out
my paper on myctophid Met tRNAs genes and their
duplicates - a trait of myctophids in particular. They
proved rather useful for phylogeny and species delimita-
tion. Ref: Poulsen JY, Byrkjedal I, Willassen E, et al.

I used chloroplast DNA for population genetic and phy-
logenetic studies in horsetails (genus /Equisetum/).
In these species, intra-population polymorphism seems
very small, likely the consequence of clonal reproduction.
For phylogenetic purpose, I was able to use intergenic
non coding chloroplast DNA sequences which gave good
results. |See attached papers. The primers used for
chloroplast DNA amplication are often anchored within
the tRNA genes, because these sequences are quite con-
served.

RockyMountainBiologicalLab REU
Jill Anderson at the University of Georgia is searching
for an enthusiastic undergraduate with a strong interest
in evolutionary ecology for eld research in an NSF REU
position (National Science Foundation, Research Expe-
rience for Undergraduates) from June-August 2019. We
study the ecological and evolutionary consequences of
climate change for natural plant populations. We focus
on research on Drummonds rockcress (Boechera stricta
in the plant family Brassicaceae), a mustard plant na-
tive to the Rocky Mountains. Our studies take place
around the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (http://-
www.rmbl.org/), which is located in Gothic, Colorado
near the wildower capital of Colorado (Crested Butte).
We quantify plant tness and traits to ask whether cli-
mate change could disrupt long-standing patterns of lo-cal adaptation, and to test whether phenotypic plasticity
will enable populations to persist in the short-term. We
perform large-scale reciprocal transplant experiments
to examine patterns of adaptive evolution and natural
selection in contemporary landscapes. Since fall 2013,
we have planted >150,000 seeds and seedlings into ve
experimental gardens ranging in elevation from 2500
m to 3340 m (8202 feet to 11000 feet). Our summer
research involves intensive monitoring of these exper-
imental plants to record data on germination success,
survival, growth, reproductive success, as well as life
history and morphological traits. We conduct most of
our work in the eld, with a small proportion of indoor
lab work.
The successful candidate will assist with ongoing eld-
work. In addition, there are many opportunities for
students to develop independent projects associated
with our overall objectives, including studies on: 1)
population divergence in ecologically-relevant traits, es-
pecially drought, UV tolerance, and herbivore resistance;
2) phenotypic plasticity at multiple spatial scales; 3)
population density and species composition of the her-
bivore community that attacks Drummonds rockcress;
4) ower color polymorphism; and 5) the importance
of maternal eects in biological responses to climate
change.
We are oering a stipend of $500/week for a full time
REU student (40 hours/week) for 10 weeks. The exact
start and end dates are exible. We will cover room and
board at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and
reimburse travel expenses up to $500. Fieldwork will
involve hiking to experimental gardens through rough
terrain (1-3 miles one-way daily).
The University of Georgia is committed to maintaining
a fair and respectful environment for living, work, and
study. To that end, all qualied applicants from indi-
viduals with a strong interest in evolutionary biology
will receive consideration for employment without re-
gard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual
orientation, gender identity, disability status, or age.
The application consists of a cover letter listing your
qualications, a CV/ rsum and contact information for
two references, all of which can be emailed to Dr. Jill
Anderson at: jta24@uga.edu
Applications are due by March 11th, 2019.

Typical activities supported include contributions to
eldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientic equip-
ment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical equip-
ment), specimen preparation (including the cost of tem-
porary technical assistance), and contributions to publi-

TreeVisualization app
Phlora: An iOS app for tree visualization and image
display
Phlora is a visualization tool for exploring phylogenetic
trees. Phlora lets you navigate around small or large
trees and display various kinds of images attached to
individual taxa. Phlora is free on the Apple App Store.
The app comes populated with examples of several phy-
logenetic trees for dierent groups of plants at scales
from a few dozen to several thousand taxa. Examples
include the cacti, the legume family as a whole, and
the legume species of Arizona, the large and diverse
genus Viburnum, and all species in the ora of Britain.
Several trees include images to illustrate the utility of
the app, including leaf images of Viburnum, whole plant
photos of cacti, and high resolution photos of herbarium
specimens of Arizona legumes. Additional photographs
can be downloaded from the app's remote database. In
addition, users can add their own images from their
photo library, Files app, or iCloud, and they can set up
their own phylogenetic trees and image collections on
other platforms to download to Phlora.
Although some background in phylogenetic biology will
be helpful for users interested in putting their own phy-
logenetic trees into Phlora, the samples included and the
extensive help guide should make this feasible for anyone
interested in doing so. Phlora also oers an opportunity
for anyone with photographs of the world's biota to
organize their data in an evolutionary framework.
Features:
* Trees with up to several thousand species can be seam-
lessly navigated. * Very high resolution images can be
associated with each species * External tree les and
image collections organized by the user can be down-
loaded to the user's device and accessed from the app
* A remote database having complete collections of im-
ages for a few of these trees can be used to explore the
potential of the app for visualization of large collections
of data * A search function allows rapid navigation to
specic places in a large phylogenetic tree * Classi-
cation schemes for groups of species can be visualized,
based on user provided phylogenetic denitions. * Spe-
cialized memory management allows gigabytes of high
resolution image data to be associated with each tree
(though there are limits to how many images can beopened to maximum resolution on screen on older iOS
devices with limited RAM).
Support for the development of this app was provided
by a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

Postdoc:: AMU Poznan.EvolutionaryGenomics
Evolutionary Biology Group of Professor Jacek Radwan
( http://evobiolab.biol.amu.edu.pl) at Adam Mickiewicz
University, Poznan, is oering a Post-Doc in an NCN-
funded project aiming to investigate eect of sexual
selection on genome-wide genetic variation using a pow-
erful approach of experimental evolution coupled with
genome re-sequencing. The candidate should hold PhD
degree in biological sciences or computer sciences and
should have signicant achievements in the area of evo-
lutionary biology, molecular genetics or bioinformatics,
published in international scientic journals. The em-
ployment is oered for three years, starting ideally in
April 2019, but it is negotiable. Please apply before 1
March 2019.
Further information about the project and application
procedure can be obtained from the project leader viaemail: jradwan@amu.edu.pl
Brief summary of the project:
Genetic variation is a fuel of evolution, therefore as-
sessing the role of sexual selection in maintaining this
variation is fundamental to our understanding of evo-
lutionary processes occurring in sexual species. The
rate and extent of adaptation depend on available ge-
netic variation, which sexual selection has long been
thought to deplete. However, recent theory predicts
that, contrary to the traditional view, sexual selection
may actually increase genetic variation due to sexual
antagonism and other trade-os associated with evolu-
tion of costly sexually-selected traits. Yet, the eect
of sexual selection on the amount of genetic variation
segregating in populations has not been investigated
empirically. The aim of the proposed project is to inves-
tigate eect of sexual selection on genome-wide genetic
variation using a powerful approach of experimental
evolution coupled with genome re-sequencing.
The project will use a species very well suited for this
purpose, the bulb mite *Rhizoglyphus robini*, a well-
established model in sexual selection research. The
project will benet from the fact that the genome of
this species has recently been assembled and annotated.82 EvolDir March 1, 2019
Replicate populations will be allowed to evolve for about
20 generations under treatments diering in (i) sex ratio,
and thus intensity of sexual selection and (ii) the fre-
quency of males bearing an elaborated sexually-selected
trait: thickened legs used for intrasexual contests. Pre-
vious research demonstrated that the trait is associated
with increased ontogenetic intersexual conict and life
history trade-os. Genomes of mites from replicated
experimental evolution lines will then be sequenced and
used for testing whether evolution of costly, condition-
dependent sexually selected traits depletes (as predicted
by traditional theory) or helps to maintain genetic poly-
morphism in functional parts of the genome (amino-acid
substitutions in protein coding genes, and nucleotide
substitutions in cis-regulatory sequences). The results
will be interpreted in the context of intragenomic vari-
ation in recombination rate, a major determinant of
genetic variation. The variation in recombination rate
will be estimated in the proposed project.

H~A^A3lar University College, Iceland, seeks a Post-
doctoral fellow for a Grant of Excellence (RANNIS)
project to study the dynamics of *Ecological (ECO),
Evolutionary (EVO) and Developmental (DEVO) pro-
cesses*
Biodiversity is under serious threat from human ac-
tivities and we lack understanding of the processes
that shape it. The phenotype, including developmental
plasticity, is an important determinant of the dynamic
interactions between ecological and evolutionary pro-
cesses. This project will study the interplay among
ECO, EVO and DEVO to ll knowledge gaps in 1) the
dual role of ecology in evolution (as driver of natural
selection and phenotypic plasticity), 2) the molecular
mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation, and 3) the
feedbacks between phenotypic change and ecosystem
function (eco-evolutionary dynamics). The project takes
a spatio-temporal perspective, using threespine stickle-
back (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) from lake M ~A^A1
2vatn,
Iceland, as a model. The project is lead by Prof. Bjarni

tory songbird species. We combine high-throughput-
sequencing data to identify sequence variants with alter-
native approaches, such as gene expression proling and
characterisation of chromatin modication or epigenetic
markers to investigate the extent of phenotypic varia-
tion manifested by expression dierences, either through
slight genetic dierences or epigenetic processes.
Our core project aims to understand: Which genes
harbour coding variation with relevant consequences
for migratory traits, and which signalling cascades are
involved in shaping the migratory phenotype?
The ideal candidate holds a PhD in Biology, has a
strong background in one or several of the following
areas: population genetics, computational biology, expe-
rience working with high-throughput sequencing data,
and is familiar with the use of data on gene expression
or epigenetic markers (scripts and analysis pipelines).
Experience in identication and characterizing of behav-
iorally regulated genes, avian neurobiology or genome
editing are great assets, but not required. The success-
ful candidate will participate in fundamental research
questions on migratory genomics. As a central member
of the group, the postdoc has good communication and
organization skills and will take part in supervising stu-
dents. We would especially welcome a creative postdoc
who is motivated to contribute to and extends our re-
search agenda developing own ideas. The position will
be oered for 2 years with the possibility of extension,
starting date is negotiable.

Project title:
Molecules meet fossils - an integrated approach to study-

Project summary:92 EvolDir March 1, 2019
An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Postdoc-
toral Research Assistant to join the Leverhulme Trust-
funded project ???Molecules meet Fossils - an inte-
grated approach to studying palaeodiversity??? to study
large-scale macroevolutionary patterns and processes in
cheilostome bryozoans. In this project we are analysing
fossil evidence and molecular data simultaneously to
produce a time-calibrated phylogeny of cheilostome bry-
ozoans using a variety of analytical approaches (tip and
node calibration; fossilized-birth-death process). Specif-
ically, we are testing whether the origins of morphologi-
cal and functional innovations resulted in an increase
in diversication and to what extent abiotic factors
inuenced speciation and extinction rates.
You will be working closely with a second Researcher
(Molecular Phylogeneticist), and with the wider multi-
disciplinary team consisting of the PI, Co-Is and a net-
work of international collaborators. You will specically
lead on the analyses that combine fossil evidence, molec-
ular and morphological data, and trait- and abiotic
paleoenvironmental data in order to study speciation
and extinction rates and diversication dynamics. As
part of this, you will assemble a dataset of large-scale
abiotic factors (climate, tectonic activity, meteorite im-
pacts, etc).
This project provides a great opportunity to apply the
latest macroevolutionary analytical approaches to an
animal group with an extensive fossil record and well-
preserved traits. We are looking for someone who has
a PhD in Evolutionary Biology or Palaeobiology, with
excellent skills in macroevolutionary analysis. Able to
work on your own initiative, you are also motivated to
work in a multidisciplinary team.

Dear colleagues,
The Evolutionary and Ecological Immunology (EEI)
group at the Faculty of Science, Charles University,
Prague, is currently advertising a ~year (extandable)
PostDoc position in avian evolutionary immunology
with deadline for applications 17th February 2019.March 1, 2019 EvolDir 93
I would be grateful if you could circulate the following
advertisement at relevant fora or pass it to whom it may
concern.
PostDoc project: Diversied cytokine regulation of in-
ammation in parrots and passerine birds
Available from April/May 2019 to June 2020 (the start-
ing date is exible; the contract can be prolonged) Ap-
plication deadline: 17th February 2019
Cytokines are protein signalling molecules that evolve
to precisely regulate immunological processes in ver-
tebrates. Several cytokines modulate inammation, a
well-known ^Adouble edged sword' of immunity that
can clear a pathogen infection as well as kill the host.
Being soluble they have the capacity to systemically
aect various tissues, including other physiological sys-
tems involved in self-maintenance and reproduction. In
this project we are interested in describing the eect
of inammation on brain function and cognition in two
related avian clades ' the passerine birds and parrots.
The objective of this PostDoc project is to characterise
tissue-specic cytokine expression changes linked to lo-
cal and/or systemic inammation in the selected taxa
of birds. A biodiversity-based approach will be adopted
to reveal interspecic and intraspecic variation in the
selected cytokine genes. The main model species of
the research will be the budgerigar (Melopsittacus un-
dulatus), the zebra nch (Taeniopygia guttata), the
great tit (Parus major) and the house nch (Haemor-
hous mexicanus). Additional species will be included
for interspecic comparison. Methods such as tissue-
specic RNA-seq, RT-qPCR and proteomic analysis
of cerebrospinal uid through gel-free quantitative LC-
MS/MS will be used (includes wet lab). Focusing on
birds that represent superior models for research in cog-
nition to rodents (passerines and parrots), this PostDoc
project opens new possibilities for interdisciplinary re-
search of neuroimmunology as well as to understanding
the evolutionary processes forming immune defence in
vertebrates.
Requirements: We seek for a researcher with experience
in molecular genetics, evolutionary genetics, immunol-

Postdoctoral Fellow in Evolutionary ecology - Life his-
tory evolution across climate clines at the Department of
Zoology<https://www.su.se/zoologi/english/ >. Clos-
ing date: 28 February 2019.
The Department of Zoology is a vibrant international
community, consisting of ve divisions: Ecology, Ethol-
ogy, Functional Morphology, Population Genetics, and
Systematics and Evolution. The department has a long
tradition of strong interactions and collaborations be-
tween the ve divisions.
Project description We are inviting applications for a
2-year post-doctoral position in Karl Gotthard's lab that
is focusing on the evolution of life history and plasticity
in seasonal environments, using primarily natural popu-
lations of butteries as model organisms. The project
is funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR).
The Post-doc will work within the project 'Life history
evolution across climate clines' and focus on the evo-
lution of life cycle timing in situations where insect
species show shifts in the number of annual generations,
i.e. when there are shifts in voltinism. As model systems
we are using several species of butteries where the phe-
notypic mechanism of life cycle regulation in response
to photoperiod and temperature is well understood, and
where we have genomic resources to explore the genetic
basis for these adaptations. We are also exploring life
cycle adaptations and potential voltinism shifts in the
expanding range margins of buttery species that are
presently expanding their distributions northwards. At
the northern range limits these expanding species are
expected to experience strong selection for changes in
how photoperiod regulates life cycle timing and vol-
tinism. These projects will provide novel insights intoecological consequences of the interaction between the
two most prominent eects of climate change on natural
populations: northward range expansions and selection
for changes in seasonal life cycle regulation.
The project will involve both eld and laboratory work
to study the ecology, genetics and physiology of adapta-
tions for seasonal life cycle timing in natural population
of temperate butteries. The post-doc will sample repli-
cated populations and do controlled laboratory studies
of the phenotypic adaptations and associated genetic
variation that underlie seasonal life cycle timing. The
genetics will be studied by quantitative genetic meth-
ods and with a combination of populations crosses and
genomics. Physiological manifestations of the dierent
timing adaptations will be investigated using respirome-
try. An important part of the project is also to set up
reciprocal transplant experiments in outdoor cages to
test the adaptive signicance of local dierence in these
adaptations.
Research group Karl Gotthard's research group is funded
by the Swedish Research Council (VR) and the Bolin
Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University,
and presently it consists of three PhD students. We col-
laborate closely with the group of Dr. Philipp Lehmann
that includes two additional PhD students. We are also
collaborating with Dr. Chris Wheat and his group at
the division of population genetics at the Department
of Zoology. The new Post-doc will be expected to take
part in these collaborations.
Main responsibilities The Post-doc will participate in

HostMicrobiomeInteractions
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is an internationally networked aquatic
research institute within the ETH Domain (Swiss Fed-
eral Institutes of Technology). Eawag conducts research,
education and expert consulting to achieve the dual goals
of meeting direct human needs for water and maintain-
ing the function and integrity of aquatic ecosystems.
The Department of Aquatic Ecology seeks to recruit a
Postdoc in Evolutionary Ecology
to study the eects of host-microbiome interactions in
adaptation to environmental stress.
The microbiome is known to inuence organismal t-
ness, via eects on behaviour, dietary interactions and
emergence of disease. However, to what extent host-
microbiome interactions mediate responses to environ-
mental stress, such as induced by anthropogenic changes
(climate change and chemical pollution), is poorly under-
stood. The goal of this project is to bridge this gap using
the freshwater isopod (Asellus aquaticus) as a model
system. The work involves next generation sequencing,
eld surveys, as well as manipulative experiments. This
project is part of a wider eort to establish A. aquaticus
as a model system and a part of the postdoc's responsi-
bilities is to aid in this. The postdoc will be based at
Eawag D ~A^A1
4bendorf, Switzerland.
A PhD degree in biology or related area is mandatory.
The ideal candidate has a strong interest in evolution-
ary ecology and microbiomes, previous experience with
molecular genetic tools, laboratory rearing experimentsand eldwork, is independent and works well in a team.
This Eawag Discretionary Funds funded position is
funded for two years and will be lled as soon as a
suitable candidate is found (earliest starting date 1st
May, 2019).
The Department of Aquatic Ecology is situated in
D~A^A1
4bendorf (near Z ~A^A1
4rich) and oers an enjoyable
and dynamic working environment with broad exper-
tise in ecology and evolution (https://www.eawag.ch/-

EvolutionDispersalPlasticity
3-year Postdoctoral research position - Dispersal plas-
ticity in microcosms
We are accepting applications for a 3-year early re-
searcher postdoc position beginning October 2019 (later
starting date possible) to work on a project focused on
the evolutionary causes and consequences of dispersal
plasticity using experimental microcosms.
Growing evidence suggests that instead of dispersing ran-
domly, individuals can modify their dispersal decisionsdepending on the environmental context to selectively
stay in or disperse toward habitats that maximize their
performance. This process, named habitat choice, has
potential major implications for ecological and evolu-
tionary dynamics (see for instance Jacob et al. 2017
Nature Ecol. Evol.; Jacob et al. 2018. PNAS).
The postdoc will join a dynamic international team
whose research interests range from understanding the
genetic mechanisms underlying individual phenotypes,
including dispersal, to the consequences of variability
in dispersal strategies and other phenotypic traits for
populations and communities, using both theory and
experiments. He/she will primarily focus on quantifying
intraspecic variability in dispersal strategies, identify-
ing the environmental conditions that favour dispersal
plasticity, and quantifying its consequences for ecological
and evolutionary dynamics, using microcosms of a cili-
ate, Tetrahymena thermophila. He/she will furthermore
be encouraged to contribute to the project objectives by
developing synergistic projects based on their own inter-
ests and expertise. He/she will also have the opportunity
to closely interact with theoreticians in order to set-up
experiments to validate or reject theoretically-derived
predictions.
The position will be co-supervised by Prof. Nicolas
Schtickzelle (UCLouvain, Belgium) and Dr. Staan
Jacob (Theoretical and Experimental Ecology Station,
CNRS, France). Experiments will be conducted in both
labs depending on the appropriate equipment and ex-
pertise, including interactions with the other researchers
collaborating on the project. We are looking for a highly
motivated and dynamic candidate with deep conceptual
interests in evolutionary ecology and ideally in phe-
notypic plasticity and dispersal. Previous experience
in microbiology, molecular biology and cytometry are
benecial but not mandatory.
Applicants should send a cover letter (1-2 pages de-
scribing motivation for the present project and pre-
vious and current research activities) and CV (in-
cluding list of publications) to Prof. N. Schtickzelle
(nicolas.schtickzelle@uclouvain.be) and Dr S. Jacob
(staan.jacob@sete.cnrs.fr), before March 29, 2019. In-
terested candidates that are currently nishing their
PhD are strongly encouraged to apply. Short-listed
candidates will be interviewed in late April. Note that
specic funding rules for this position limit eligibility
to early stage researchers ( <6 years post-PhD defense)
who have lived less than 12 months in Belgium during
the past 3 years.

Postdoctoral fellowship in population and quantitative
genetics:
The Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, at Uni-
versity of Copenhagen invites applications for a 3-year
postdoctoral fellow position at the University of Copen-
hagen, in the research group of Fernando Racimo. The
Racimo group focuses on using ancient and present-day
genomes to understand patterns of selection and ad-
mixture over time, and to develop methods to jointly
analyze population and functional genomic data. We
are particularly interested in human evolution, on both
an ancient scale (i.e. modeling the joint history of Nean-
derthals, Denisovans and modern humans) and a recent
scale (i.e. nding functional variants that were selected
in humans during major cultural transitions, like the
advent of agriculture).Objectives
The candidate will be able to work with unprecedentedly
large ancient genomic dataset from a period spanning
the last 50,000 years of human history, in combination
with functional datasets and medical biobanks. The
focus of the project will be on integrating ancient ge-
nomics with population genetic theory and quantitative
genetic resources, to learn about how humans adapted
to their environments as they expanded across the globe,
with a particular focus on complex trait evolution.
The candidate will have freedom to design their project
in consultation with the advisor, and the project can
range from theoretical methods development to em-
pirical data analysis. Research topics can include: 1)
Utilizing trait-association data from metabolic, neuro-
logical and anthropometric studies to learn about the
evolution of complex traits in ancient genomes from
the Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age; 2)
Developing methods to detect genes under positive selec-
tion when working with multiple populations related to
each other in complex ways; 3) Searching for functional
variants that were positively selected in humans over
time during major cultural transitions, like the advent
of agriculture; 4) Testing among dierent models of
evolution on trait-associated variants over time.
Research environment
The candidate will work at the Lundbeck GeoGe-
netics Centre, a world-leading institution in ancient
DNA studies. The position is for 3 years, and is
fully funded. The candidate will have to opportu-
nity to collaborate with leaders in the elds of pale-

16 months post doc: Defence behaviour and personality
in Apis mellifera against the invasive predator Vespa
velutina
Following its introduction a decade ago, the yellow-
legged hornet, Vespa velutina, has been spreading
through Europe. This invasive predator is mainly known
for chasing domestic honeybees, Apis mellifera. Locally,
predation pressure can reach 20 hornets in front of each
hive. While its hunting behaviour is quite understood
now, some points are still unclear especially how hornets
choose their prey. Indeed, we have previously shown
that the distribution of hornets within the apiary was
not homogeneous and uncorrelated to honeybee colony
strength. We suggest that this pattern is link to colony
behaviour, some of them being probably more prone at
defending themselves against this predator. Honeybee
colonies behave as a superorganism and their personality
traits may greatly vary among colonies. Behavioural
traits like boldness, activity and aggressiveness are thus
interesting to quantify, as well as the ability of the colony
to recruit enough workers for defence purpose which is
probably trading-o with the maintenance of foraging
activity (which ensures colony survival).
The aims of this work are divers. First, it will provide
new insights on how hornets adjust their hunting eort
depending on prey behaviour, which opens interesting
perspectives for the study of cognitive ability in prey-
predator systems. Second, identifying the factors driving
heterogeneous predation pressure in apiaries would be
a mean to propose new pest management directions for
beekeepers. Defence behaviour in honeybees has been
shown to have a genetic basis thus dierent lineages
may produce dierent level of defence. If conrmed, it
may open perspectives for honeybee livestock selection
based on behavioural traits thus limiting the impact on
bee colonies.
Qualications:
The post-doctoral fellow will be integrated in the Euro-
pean Arc Atlantique 'Positive' project. We are looking
for a young PhD in behavioural ecology with skills in
eldwork, statistical analyses (mixed eects models)
and a previous experience with social insects. Driving
licence for more than 2 years is also required.

A post-doctoral fellowship is available in the University
of Edinburgh with Professor J. Ross Fitzgerald and col-
leagues (https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/lbep). Antimicro-
bial resistance (AMR) is a global veterinary and public
health issue. The 3 year-funded project involves a group-
ing of microbiologists, bioinformaticians and veterinary
and human medical clinicians in the Roslin Institute,
University of Edinburgh. We have demonstrated the
capacity for Nanopore-based whole genome sequencing

UExeter MicrobialEvolution
One-year postdoc position in microbial evolution Uni-
versity of Exeter, Cornwall Campus
Project title: \Context-dependent acquisition of antibi-
otic resistance mechanisms"
The dramatic increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
threatens the eective treatment of a wide range of in-
fections and forms a global challenge to public health.
To eectively combat AMR, it is crucial we understand
the mechanisms by which it evolves. This project will
test for the eects of antibiotic concentration and mi-
crobiome diversity on mechanisms of AMR evolution.
Bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance via point mu-
tations but are also able to take up resistance genes
from other strains and species. The latter process might
occur at the same rate as mutation but the relative
importance of these two fundamentally distinct genetic
mechanisms in generating AMR is not known. The
main project aim is to combine antibiotic selection with
whole-genome re-sequencing in a bacterial pathogen to
identify the prevalence of distinct genetic mechanisms
(horizontal gene transfer versus point mutations) respon-
sible for AMR. This project will provide fundamental
data on bacterial genome evolution as well as provide ascientic basis for pollution management.
The project is supervised by Dr. Michiel Vos (UEMS),
Prof. Will Gaze (UEMS), Prof. Angus Buckling (CLES)
and Dr. Ben Temperton (CLES). Work will take place
in state-of-the-art microbiology labs at the ESI building
at the University of Exeter's Penryn campus.
The successful applicant will possess a PhD in the eld
of microbiology or a related subject with demonstrable
anity with experimental evolution, molecular microbi-
ology and genomics. You will be able to work collabo-
ratively, communicate eectively, co-supervise students
and be willing to travel on occasion to Exeter.

Project title:
Temperature uctuations as universal engine for evolu-
tionary diversication of sex-determination: a theoreti-
cal study using mechanistic models
Project summary:
Sexual reproduction is ubiquitous in the animal king-
dom. Although gonadal developmental pathways are
often conserved over deep evolutionary time, the primary
regulators that determine the sexual pathway vary enor-
mously, sometimes even within species. Many hypothe-
ses have been proposed to explain the high evolutionary
turnover rate of sex-determination (SD) mechanisms,
including sexual antagonism, maternal eects and mei-
otic drive. However, these theoretical models do not
provide a universal explanation for the proliferation of
SD mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests a universal
role for temperature uctuations as a main driver of SD
diversity. We propose that existing theory of SD evo-
lution needs a major overhaul by explicitly integrating
mechanistic and thermodynamic aspects of gene regula-
tory networks with an ecological context that explicitly
captures spatio-temporal uctuations in temperature.
We will develop new models that incorporate evolvable
temperature sensitivity of gene regulatory network com-
ponents, sex-specic tness eects as well as temporal
(within and between generations) and spatial (within
and between populations) variation in temperature. We
aim to build two classes of models: (1) relatively simple
models generalizable across taxa that address general
questions on eects of temperature and its interactions
with other selective forces on the evolution of SD mech-
anisms; and (2) highly species-specic models based on
the biology of well-studied organisms aiming for quan-
titatively testable predictions, in close collaboration
with several experimental research groups. With our
novel approach we will be able to better understand the
diversity of SD mechanisms and its evolution.
Requirements of candidates: We are looking for a highly
motivated candidate with a relevant PhD who can work
in a multidisciplinary team combining evolutionary stud-
ies with mathematical modelling.106 EvolDir March 1, 2019

UmeaU LandscapeGenomicsConifers
The Department of Ecology and Environmental Science
(Ume a University, Sweden) invites applicants for a post
doc fellowship on landscape genomics and phylogeogra-
phy of conifer trees.
Project description Genetic diversity is the key com-
ponent underpinning forest resilience to disturbances
such as climate change, habitat loss and novel pests
and diseases. The level of standing genetic variation in
the boreal conifer forests is shaped by the evolutionary
history unique to the region and by human activities.
Migration out of refugia that survived the Last Glacial
Maximum, and gene exchange along the routes of range
expansion have strong impact on the genetic structure
of extant populations. The project aims to reconstruct
the recent evolutionary history of major Eurasia conifer
species (e.g. Scots pine, Norway spruce, etc.), and to
characterize how neutral and adaptive processes have
contributed to genetic diversity.
The postdoc will participate in developing and apply-ing methods for inferring phylogeography, migration,
hybridization, and natural selection from population ge-
nomic data. The research will mainly include modelling
and data analyses. Molecular lab work is a minor part
of the position (10 %). The postdoc will also have the
freedom to contribute to other ongoing projects and
to develop own projects that mesh with the group's
interests.
The fellowship is funded by a tax-free 2-year scholarship
from Carl Tryggers Foundation, amounting to 23,000
SEK per month. The scholarship is for two years start-
ing in June 2019, or according to agreement.
Qualications A PhD degree in evolutionary genetics,
or a related eld is a demand. We seek highly motivated
candidates with a broad interest in landscape genomics.
To be eligible for this fellowship, you should have com-
pleted your doctoral degree a maximum three (3) years
before the end of the application period. Good ability
to co-operate is requested as good skills in written and
spoken English. Experience with genome sequence data
is a merit, including familiarity with phylogenetic analy-
ses and statistical programming (e.g. Linux, R, Python).
Experience with GIS and coalescence simulations for
complex models is advantageous.

UppsalaU EvolutionaryGenetics
POST DOC POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY GE-
NETICS - Sexual Selection and Mutation Rate The
Department of Ecology and Genetics at Uppsala Univer-
sity are looking to hire a post doc on a 2-year contract.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Mutations form the raw
material for evolution and do not only aect rates of
adaptation and extinction but also cause fundamen-
tal human health problems. New evidence has demon-
strated that mutation rates can vary systematically both
across the genome and with the health of individuals. In
many species, including humans, there are also system-
atic dierences between the two biological sexes, with
frequently observed male-bias in mutation rate. These
ndings have broad implications for a wide range of evo-
lutionary and demographic processes but the ultimate
causes for the observed variation remain a matter of con-
siderable debate. The successful applicant will take an
approach combining experimental evolution and genome
sequencing to understand the role of sexual selection
in shaping within- and between-population variation in
mutation rate.
The rst aim is to explore the molecular basis for a
link between investment in sexually selected traits and
germline DNA repair by comparing gene expression in
experimental evolution lines of seed beetles stored from
a previous experiment.
The second aim is to use DNA sequencing to explore the
type and location of mutations left unchecked by the
DNA repair system in individuals challenged to engage
in sexual competition. This will explore heterogeneity
in DNA repair across the genome and link this variation
to trade-os with investment in sexual reproduction.
The candidate will work in close association with the
host Dr. David Berger and PhD student Julian Baur,
and share lab space and interact with members of the
groups of Prof. G ~A^AArnqvist and Dr. Elina Immonen.
Currently, the beetle lab consists of 8 members and
occasional project students.
WORKING ENVIRONMENT: The Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre hosts one of the world's largest aggregations
of evolutionary biologists and Uppsala University was
recently ranked 7th in the world in evolutionary biology
(CWUR 2017). The Department of Ecology and Genet-ics is an international environment with sta from all
over the world. Our research spans from evolutionary
ecology and genetics to studies of ecosystems. A num-
ber of high-prole projects address natural and sexual
selection, local adaptation, speciation, molecular evolu-
tion, microbial diversity, and ecosystem processes. For
more information, see: ieg.uu.se. Uppsala University
is the oldest university in Scandinavia and the city of
Uppsala is a vibrant college town with beautiful sur-
roundings conveniently situated 40 minutes by train
from Stockholm.
QUALIFICATIONS: A Phd degree in evolutionary,
quantitative, population or molecular genetics, or equiv-
alent. We seek highly motivated candidates with a
broad interest in evolutionary biology. Experience with
sequence data is a merit, including familiarity with lab-
oratory molecular methods and experimental design,
and/or analytical methods and statistical programming
(e.g. R, Python, C).
POSITION: The postdoc is funded by a tax-free 2-year
scholarship from Carl Tryggers Foundation, amounting
to 23,000 SEK per month.

sent in before February 9, 2019 will be given priority.

Postdoctoral Scholar in Ecological Epigenetics, Univer-
sity of South Florida
The University of South Florida is seeking to hire 1
postdoctoral scholar to perform research on epigenetic
and physiological mechanisms involved in the spread of
the house sparrow across the globe. The individual will
work on this research project in the College of Public
Health in an eort to obtain federal grant support to
expand the scope and extend the duration of the project.
Successful candidates will be part of an interdisciplinary
program seeking to discern how epigenetic potential
(i.e., DNA sequence variation inuencing DNA methy-
lation, gene expression and hence phenotypic plasticity)
impacts the success of colonizing populations. Work
will involve collaborating with and co-managing project
personnel, performing various molecular techniques, an-
alyzing resultant data, and writing manuscripts and
presenting ndings at various meetings. Willingness to
travel and work internationally, sometimes for weeks to
months at a time, is imperative, as is willingness to con-
tribute to grant writing eorts. The postdoc will have
some latitude to develop her/his own research projects,
as long as they complement the foci of the main project.
Importantly, the Martin lab at USF recently hired a
postdoc for a completely dierent project (i.e., scaling
of immunity in mammals); this position is distinct from
that one.
USF is one of the 10 largest academic institutions in
the United States and oers unique opportunities for
collaboration with research institutions in Africa, Asia,
Latin America and the Caribbean. The post-doc will
be located at University of South Florida but will also
travel occasionally to collect samples.
Competitive candidates must have a PhD or equivalent
degree in biology, ecology, behavior, and/or evolution,
and should have experience working with live verte-
brates and some familiarity with molecular techniques
(e.g., hormone assays, quantitative PCR, RNA-seq) and
associated analyses as well as a solid publication record.
Preferred Qualications: Procient in Program R or
an equivalent, experience with physiological, behavioral,
avian eld work, and transcriptomics methods. Strong
record of research achievements. Candidates must be
highly motivated, able to think and work independentlybut as part of a multidisciplinary research team. Can-
didates must also be willing to travel internationally,
sometimes for long periods.

When : 25-29 March 2019
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany)
Website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course46/ )
Registration deadline: 25th February 2019
Instructor:
Prof. Dr. Shravan Vasishth (http://www.ling.uni-
potsdam.de/~vasishth/)
In this course, we provide a relatively accessible and
technically non-demanding introduction to the basic
workow for tting dierent kinds of linear models using
Stan. To illustrate the capability of Bayesian model-
ing, we will use the R package RStan and a powerful
front-end R package for Stan called brms.
After completing this course, the participant will have
become familiar with the foundations of Bayesian in-
ference using Stan (RStan and brms), and will be able
to t a range of multiple regression models and hierar-
chical models, for normally distributed data, and for
log-normal, poisson, multinomial, and binomially dis-
tributed data. They will know how to calibrate their
models using prior and posterior predictive checks; they
will be able to establish true and false discovery rates
to validate discovery claims, and to carry out model
comparison using cross-validation methods, and Bayes
factors.

Feb11-May1
We have two upcoming workshops this Spring Semester
and both are open for registration. They tend to ll up
fast, so please apply early!
Supercomputing for Everyone Series: Introduction to R
for Biologists APPLICATION DEADLINE: None - but
the workshops are already over 2/3 full
In this three day workshop, learn about the basics of the
R language - structure, data types, and functions - that
will help you read and write R. The rst day will cover
the basics of the language, the second day will cover
basic visualization of mapping and ordination data, and
the third day will dive into classes and writing your own
functions. A lecture and Lab will be taught on each day,
February 11, 18, and 25 from 1pm - 4pm Eastern Time.
This workshop is being oered at IU-Bloomington,
IUPUI, and online. Lectures will be streamed via zoom,
materials are available online for labs, and online oce
hours will be provided for online participants through
slack.

Series: de novo assembly of transcriptomes using HPC
resources workshop APPLICATION DEADLINE MON-
DAY FEBRUARY 25 at 5pm! Selections will be made
by mid March.
The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NC-
GAS) at Indiana University seeks interested participants
for this FREE National Science Foundation-sponsored
three-day workshop.
Registration page: http://go.iu.edu/29rf NCGAS is
oering a National Science Foundation-sponsored, three-124 EvolDir March 1, 2019
day workshop on high performance computing (HPC)
usage and de novo transcriptome assembly. It will take
place April 29-May 1st on the IU Bloomington campus.
Registration is free, but application is required.
The workshop will include discussions, lectures, and
hands-on tutorials to cover topics important to get-
ting started constructing and analyzing transcriptomes-
without the use of a genome. Material covers both the
availability and use of HPC resources, alongside the task
of assembling a new transcriptome, in order to provide
a more comprehensive preparation for this and future
bioinformatic tasks.
Transcriptome assembly will consist of using four sepa-
rate assemblers (Trinity, SOAP de novo, Velvet Oases,
and TransABySS), with multiple kmers, to be com-
bined and curated with Evigenes. This combined as-
sembly with multiple parameters is considered much
more robust than simply using one assembler, and the
NCGAS pipeline streamlines the process and allows for
customization if desired.
While material will make heavy use of XSEDE and IU
machines, the material is transferable to any cluster.

Ploen TransgenerationalInheritance
Nov6-8
Dear colleagues,
We would like to announce a workshop on \Causes and
Consequences of Transgenerational Inheritance", which
will take place at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on, Germany, between the 6th and
8th of November 2019.
Workshop Description: Parental eects occur when the
phenotype of one or both parent(s) aects the phenotype
of ospring beyond direct eects of genetic inheritance.
Eects can be maladaptive, for instance when ospring
lifespan and/or reproductive success are reduced be-
cause of transgenerational senescence, or adaptive, for
example when parasite exposure of parents primes theMarch 1, 2019 EvolDir 125
immune responsiveness of ospring. From a mechanistic
perspective, the question which processes underlie trans-
generational inheritance remains open. Moreover, from
an evolutionary point of view, the tness consequences
of transgenerational inheritance and its impact on adap-
tation to changing environments are also mostly un-
known. In this workshop, we aim to discuss examples of
transgenerational inheritance in natural populations of
non-model organisms, potential mechanisms underlying
such patterns, as well as its evolutionary underpinnings
and consequences.
Plenary speakers: Sandra Bouwhuis (Institute of Avian
Research, Germany), Alexei Maklakov (University of
East Anglia, UK), Eric Miska (University of Cambridge,
UK), Pat Monaghan (University of Glasgow, UK), Bram
Kuijper (University of Exeter, UK) & Tobias Uller
(Lund University, Sweden).
Format: Plenary talks are scheduled for 30 min (25 + 5
min for questions), classic talks for 15 min (12 + 3 min
for questions). Poster presenters are invited to give a 3
min ash talk at the start of the workshop to advertise
their poster prior to the poster session.
Costs: We do not charge a registration fee. A limited
number of travel grants will be available on a competitive
basis. To apply, please explain your funding situation, in-
dicate your motivation for joining the meeting and send
your abstract and CV to transgenin@evolbio.mpg.de.
Registration: Abstract submission is open until April
30th, registration until October 21st. We will in-
form participants about the outcome of abstract se-
lection by early June. For registration and ab-

Portugal WildlifeConservation
Apr8-11
During this 4 days course we will expose students to the
scientic basis and practical applications of the study
of wildlife population biology. The modern study of
wildlife population ecology orchestrates a dance at theinterface of reliable eldwork and the use of mathemati-
cal tools and population genetic techniques. Students
will learn how to collect the data necessary to study
wildlife populations, and how to assess the factors that
aect population growth and interactions with other
species. This will include descriptors of population
dynamics (eg. trends in abundance, cycles), projec-
tions of deterministic and stochastic population mod-
els with stage structure, mechanisms and modeling of
density dependence (positive and negative), targeting
specic conservation actions through sensitivity analy-
sis, metapopulation and source-sink dynamics, viability
analysis, and the interface between genetic variation
and population performance. The focus will be on how
to rigorously analyze population dynamics and apply
the inferences to better conservation decision-making.
By the end of the course, students should have the con-
dence to advance both management and research by
eectively using data, models, and the ecological con-
cepts to address pressing questions involving the harvest,
monitoring, and conservation of wildlife populations.

Dear all,
We are currently accepting applications to participate
in an RCN-IDEAS (http://ideas.princeton.edu) funded
workshop on \Evolutionary Consequences of Feedbacks
Between Within-host Competition and Disease Control,
to be held at Princeton University, June 9-10, 2019.
Accepted applicants will receive funding for transporta-
tion to/from Princeton, accommodation and meals dur-
ing the workshop, and the registration fee for the 2019
EEID conference that follows the workshop (note that
accommodation and meals during the conference are
not covered; http://ideas.princeton.edu/eeid-2019/ ).
A detailed description of the summary, goals, and con-
rmed participants is below and can be found here:
http://ideas.princeton.edu/future-workshops-2/ . To
apply, submit your CV and a cover letter (1 page maxi-
mum) describing your interest in participating in this
workshop, including relevant background/data/models
and the types of questions that most interest you.
Please email your full application by March 31, 2019 to
nicole.mideo@utoronto.ca, with the subject line ¥2019RCN-IDEAS Workshop.
Summary Health interventions and within-host compe-
tition are two of the most potent sources of selection
on parasites. Each has some well characterized eects
on parasite traits: the evolution of resistance is a pre-
dictable consequence of drug treatment, while compe-
tition within a host drives the evolution of virulence
(either higher or lower, depending on the system). Yet
the feedbacks between these processes have only par-
tially been mapped. For instance, competition within
an infection can inuence the ecacy of drug treatment
and the likelihood of a resistant mutant spreading, but
the best ways to exploit or mimic competitive eects
to slow resistance evolution are unclear. Similarly, dis-
ease control eorts V when eective V can reduce the
prevalence of infection, which should alter the frequency
of coinfection and thus the tness landscape for viru-
lence, yet few predictions about the ecacy of control
measures account for the role of such epidemiological
feedbacks in modulating disease severity.
Goals This workshop aims to bring together evolution-
ary biologists, disease ecologists, epidemiologists, and
microbiologists to understand the scope and implica-
tions of feedbacks between within-host competition and
disease control eorts. Focal questions will be gener-
ated at the meeting based on participant interest, but
possible topics include the following.
- When is single- versus multiple-infection a useful di-
chotomy, and when is it necessary to consider a contin-
uum of infection outcomes based on parasite diversity
within the host? - How does coinfection alter key epi-
demiological parameters (transmission rate and infection
duration)? Are there predictable patterns across sys-
tems? - When does diversity of infection, in the absence
of variation in resistance, inuence treatment outcomes?
- To what extent do mechanisms underlying competi-
tion need to be understood in order to be exploited
for public health gain? Are there systems for which
that level of understanding has been achieved? - Is
there a predictable relationship between prevalence of
infection and frequency of coinfection? - Given that
many public health interventions exert direct selection
on parasite traits (e.g., selection for resistance under
drug treatment), are there cases where the potential for
indirect selection via epidemiological feedbacks will be
particularly important?
Researchers with relevant datasets, mathematical mod-
els, or statistical tools will work in breakout sessions
organized around these focal questions (or others, de-
pending on the interest of participants), identifying the
most fruitful approaches for answering them.

SpeciationGenomicsAndGWAS
Sep2-6
Dear all,
following the success of last year, we are happy to in-
form you that we are oering other two new full-week
courses at Laval University (Quebec City, Canada) this
September.
1) Speciation Genomics - 2-6 September 2019 -
(https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course37/ )
Instructors: i) Dr. Mark Ravinet (Univeristy of Oslo,
Norway); ii) Dr. Joana Meier (University of Cambridge,
UK).
Overview: This course will provide a thorough introduc-
tion to the growing eld of speciation genomics. The
course aims to take students from the initial steps re-
quired for handling raw sequencing data to demographic
modelling and inference of genome-wide signatures of
selection and introgression. Through a combination of
lectures covering key theoretical and conceptual topics,
alongside hands-on exercises, participants will learn the
most important computational approaches used in spe-
ciation genomics. This will include a heavy emphasis on
data visualization and intepretation. After completing
of the course, the participants should be able to begin
using NGS data to shed light on the genomic aspects of
speciation in their study system of choice.
2) GWAS - 9-13 September 2019 - ( https:/-
/www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course49/ )
Instructors: i) Dr Filippo Biscarini (CNR, Italy); ii)
Eric Normandeau (Laval University, Canada)
Overview: This course will introduce students, re-searchers and professionals to the steps needed to build
an analysis pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Stud-
ies (GWAS). The course will, on one hand, describe all
the necessary steps involved in a typical GWAS study;
on the other hand, we will build a reusable and repro-
ducible GWAS pipeline.

UCLA/La Kretz Workshop in Conservation Genomics,
23 - 27 March, 2019
Conservation biology, genetics, and evolutionary biol-
ogy have had a long and intimate relationship, and
conservation constitutes one of the key applications of
evolutionary analysis to real-world biological problems.
The impacts of population and landscape genetics and
gene expression studies have been particularly strik-
ing, and are helping to solve some of the most pressing
problems in biological conservation.
As the eld of conservation genetics continues to grow
and mature, the availability of genome-scale data stand
to make profound new contributions to our ability to
identify and protect at-risk populations and recover
those that are most endangered. However, genomic
analyses also carry a computational burden-data sets
are enormous, often require diverse skills and approaches
for assembly, quality control and analysis.
The La Kretz annual workshop provides a comfort-
able, rigorous, and informal training environment for a
small group of motivated graduate students to explore
how conservation problems can best be addressed with
genomic-level data. Our goal is to provide hands-on
experience in the ecient collection, troubleshooting,
and analysis of large data sets for conservation-relevant
problems. One of the highlights of our workshop is
active participation from members of several govern-
mental agencies who are at the forefront of endangered
species protection and management, providing a forum
for exploring the most relevant aspects of conservation
genomics to managers.
This year, the Woolsey re destroyed most of our
beloved UCLA/La Kretz Field Station (https://-www.ioes.ucla.edu/santa-monica-mountains-research/)
where we normally house the workshop. However,
through an incredibly generous subsidy, we will house
participants this year at the Calamigos Ranch next door
(https://www.calamigos.com), with classes at the UCLA
Stunt Ranch Reserve (http://stuntranch.ucnrs.org/),
both in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains.
Only 30 miles from UCLA and the LAX airport, but
nestled in the relatively undeveloped 160,000 acre
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,
Calamigos is a gorgeous setting, and Stunt Reserve
provides an ideal location to explore new developments
in genomic science and pressing needs in conservation

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am interested in the 'Data and Models in Ecology and
Evolution' summer school running from the 8th-12th of
July 2019. I am currently enrolled in a postgraduate
masters course at UCL and so do not have a PhD su-
pervisor; however, I will be looking to undertake one in
future.
I've noticed on the attachment on your email that you
require a letter of recommendation from a PhD supervi-
sor as a condition of application. Would it be possible
to apply/attend without having a PhD supervisor cur-
rently?
Any information would be greatly appreciated. I look
forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,
Ryan Brewer

Sep17-27
Course on Systematics, Morphology and Evolution of
Marine Molluscs
Marine Biological Station Vostok (Vladivostok), Russia,
17V27 September 2019
The University Museum of Bergen (University of Bergen,
Norway), Shirshov Institute of Oceanology (Russia),
National Scientic Center of Marine Biology, Russian
Academy of Sciences (Russia), and ForBio (Research
School in Biosystematics) jointly oer an International
Course on Systematics, Morphology and Evolution of
Marine Molluscs.
The course will cover a wide range of taxa including
aplacophorans, polylplacophorans, gastropods, bivalves,
cephalopods, and scaphopods. The lectures will ad-
dress various theoretical questions in molluscan biology,
morphology and systematics. Major hypotheses on the
phylogenetic relationships between the main molluscan
clades will be addressed and evolutionary adaptations
to various, sometime extreme, marine biotopes will be
discussed. During the lab work we will study external
and internal morphology of selected Mollusca taxa and
perform anatomical dissections. Species used in the
course will be collected by professional divers but also
by the students during the intertidal and small boat
eld trips in the vicinity of the Station.
PhD candidates will be given priority, but based on
availability MSc students and postdoctoral researchers
on the beginning of their careers may also be considered.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
