Asilomar ASN Jan3-7 CallSymposia
*The American Society of Naturalists*
Call for Symposia to be held at the
ASN meeting at Asilomar, California 3-7 Jan 2020
*Due March 31, 2019*
The American Society of Naturalists invites proposals
for symposia at its stand-alone meeting at Asilomar, inMonterey, California, 3-7 January 2020. Two symposia
will be selected.
Symposium topics should support the Societys goal to
advance the conceptual unication of the biological sci-
ences and to further knowledge in evolution, ecology,
behavior, and organismal biology. Proposals are encour-
aged on topics that are synthetic and interdisciplinary,
or that address important emerging issues in evolution,
ecology, and behavior.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (one page); (3) a tentative list of
speakers, including institutional aliations; (4) a jus-
tication for the symposium explaining why the topic
and speakers are appropriate for an ASN meeting, keep-
ing in mind the broader goals of the society ( http://-
www.amnat.org/about/about-the-society.html); and (5)
a statement that all proposed invited speakers have
agreed to participate. Organizers should plan the sym-
posia to run from approximately 1:30-5:30 pm, and
may allocate this time amongst speakers as they wish,
reserving time for a coee break.
Proposals must be submitted by midnight Eastern
Standard Time on March 31, 2019 by email to
kmkay@ucsc.edu as a single pdf attachment and un-
der the subject heading: *ASN Asilomar Symposium
Proposal*. Proposals that include women, young inves-
tigators, and individuals from underrepresented groups
are especially encouraged.
Please note that, as with previous Asilomar meetings,
the society does not have funds to pay for travel or
lodging expenses of speakers. However, we may consider
requests to waive conference registration costs for junior
participants in symposia in cases of nancial hardship.
Nevertheless, speakers should assume that they will
likely have to cover their own travel costs.
The Societys selection committee will evaluate propos-
als based on the likelihood of attracting a substantial
audience, the signicance and timeliness of the topic,
and on the topics diering substantively from recent
symposia hosted by the Society. All applicants will be
notied of the committees decision by late April 2019.

ISMB/ECCB 2019 EvolCompGen COSI: Call for ab-
stracts
We are soliciting abstract submissions for talks or
posters at the Evolution and Comparative Genomics
Community of Interest (EvolCompGen COSI) track at
ISMB/ECCB 2019, which will take place July 21-25,
2019 in Basel, Switzerland. https://evolcompgen.org/-
meetings/ismb-eccb 2019 The goal of the track is to
foster exchange and collaborations between developers
and users of computational methods in evolution and
comparative genomics within the ISCB.
The track will feature a mix of proceedings talks (for
which the submission deadline has already passed) and
contributed talks from the submitted abstracts (dead-
line: April 11th). In addition, there will be a poster
session.
To make the most of the limited time, contributed talks
will be 10 minutes including Q&A. Talks can be on
unpublished work or work published after January 1,
2018, and delivered by speakers at any career stage.
The selection will be made by a committee chaired by
A da Ouangraoua and Lars Arvestad, based on the fol-
lowing criteria: (i) signicance and novelty of the contri-
bution; (ii) completeness of the description of methods,
data, and analysis; (iii) quality of the presentation.
Travel fellowships will be available for presenting stu-
dents and postdocs. The procedure for application
will be communicated to the relevant people in the
talk/poster acceptance email.

Hi All,
Registration is now open but will be closing soon (29th
March) for this years annual Ecological Genetics Group
meeting, in association with the British Ecological Soci-
ety and Genetics Society. So getting registering so you
don't miss out!
This years conference is to be held on the 16th to the
18th of April at the stunning Downing College, Univer-
sity of Cambridge. There will be a full scientic and
social programme throughout the conference to bring
together those with an interest in population genetics
and ecology and evolution. The programme will include
a series of talks and a poster session on relevant topics
including talks by our two conrmed guest speaks,

partment of Plant Sciences www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk Bi-
ography: Dr Matt Davey is a plant and algal physiol-ogist at the Department of Plant Sciences, University
of Cambridge. His key interests are in understanding
the diversity of metabolism in natural ecosystems and
controlled environments and how such knowledge can be
translated for innovation purposes by collaborating with
industrial partners involved in bioenergy and natural
high value products.
And Prof Bill Amos, Department of Zoology, University
of Cambridge https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/-
william-amos Professor William Amos jDepartment of
Zoology www.zoo.cam.ac.uk I am interested in many
aspects of evolutionary genetics. My early work focused
on using techniques such as DNA ngerprinting to in-
vestigate breeding behaviour and population structure
in marine mammals, particularly the long-nned pilot
whale and the grey seal.
There will also be the opportunity for a behind the
scenes tour of the Sainsbury Laboratory Herbarium at
the University. A collection dating back 300 years that
will allow you to get up close to specimens collected by
the Grandfathers of evolutionary theory, Darwin and
Wallace. The Cambridge Genomics Services will a be
holding a Genomics and Bioinformatics session to help
with all your Next-Gen needs. And our postgrad stu-
dent workshop this year it will be on 'How to review a
paper.'
Let us not forgot the now famous EGG-Heads quiz
which will be held after the conference dinner.

The conference program is now online. Invited speak-
ers include Alex Badyaev, Renee Duckworth, Laurel
Fogarty, Jukka Jernvall, Alan C Love, Joanna Masel,
Armin Moczek, Angela Potochnik, Sean Rice and Jessica
Riskin.
Evolutionary biology is a vibrant eld with a theoretical
framework that itself evolves. The Evolution Evolving
conference will focus on some emerging themes in the
relationship between development and evolution. Top-
ics include the evolutionary causes and consequences of
developmental bias, plasticity, niche construction and
extra-genetic inheritance V all of which contribute to
an understanding of evolvability. The conference will
feature a balanced program of talks and poster sessions
spanning three days, and be a mix of empirical and
theoretical work, as well as contributions to the history
and philosophy of evolutionary biology.

Summary
Most natural systems are impacted by human activities
such as resource extraction, habitat perturbation, and
the introduction of alien species. While human impact
poses a serious threat to many of these systems, it can
also generate testable hypotheses about the process of
molecular evolution. In this meeting, we will bring to-
gether African and international researchers that use
genetics or genomics (in the broad sense) to study nat-
ural systems impacted by human activities. We will
discuss how the study of such systems can help us un-
derstand the process of evolution in general, and also
how this understanding can be applied to both natural
conservation and resource management. We will focus
on the genomic eects of hybridisation between native
and alien species, and the impact of human-induced
selection on genomes (be it directly through hunting orApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 11
shing, or indirectly through environmental perturba-
tion). Furthermore, we will discuss population genomic
techniques to infer human-induced population changes
and the use of (meta-) genomics to monitor ecosystems.

AncientDnaForSelection
Dear colleagues,
We would like to invite you to the symposium titled
\Using Ancient DNA to Study Natural Selection: New
Models and New Data", to be held during the SMBE
meeting in Manchester (21-25 July).
More information about the SMBE symposia can be
found here: http://smbe2019.org/programme/symposia-
overview/ As the number of published ancient genomes
is growing rapidly, there is also increasing interest in go-
ing beyond demographic inference and using this new in-
formation for studying past and present adaptation. The
temporal dimension provided by the incoming aDNA
data can boost power to identify selection signatures.
For instance, ancient genomes can be used to study soft
sweeps aecting polygenic traits, dicult to investigate
using present-day genomic variation only. Increased
time resolution can further facilitate testing hypotheses
on the ecological drivers of past selection events. But
despite all its lure, using aDNA to study selection also
involves considerable obstacles, including low coverage
or partial genomes, typically small sample sizes, post-
mortem damage confounding polymorphism, and other
hurdles such as combining data produced using dierent
strategies. This session will be an opportunity to start
discussing these issues to promote the wider employment
of aDNA in studying adaptation. We particularly invite
talks describing novel methodology to most eciently
use available data to capture selection signatures. Wealso invite researchers studying adaptive processes us-
ing ancient genomes to share exciting new examples of
adaptation in humans, domestic species, and natural
populations, including selection on multigenic traits and
adaptive introgression.

DetectingSelection
We would like to invite you to the symposium on
\Genome-wide methods for detecting selection" to be
held during the SMBE19 meeting in Manchester (21-25
July).
Natural selection is a key process in evolutionary bi-
ology, and despite being a well-established concept in
evolutionary theory, detecting and measuring selection
signatures genome-wide remains still challenging. In
the last two decades, many probabilistic models have
helped us to investigate dierent types such as purifying,
positive or balancing selection. However, the debate
on how complex these models should be to adequately
describe the selection mechanisms while considering con-
founding factors such as demography and xation biases
(e.g., biased gene conversion) is still ongoing. Recently,
approaches to detect signatures of selection that are
based on machine learning techniques have been devel-
oped. Deep-learning algorithms generally incorporate
fewer explicit assumptions about the genetic signatures
of natural selection than mechanistic models and were
shown useful for discovering subtle patterns hidden in
large amounts of data. However, these methods cannot
be used for inference are rather descriptive and less suit-
able for predictions. In this symposium, we will bring
together researchers of both mechanistic and machine
learning approaches, and we hope to enable a discussion
that will benet the evolutionary community.

We would like to invite you to submit abstracts to sym-
posium \Mutation Rate Evolution".
Symposium overview: There is a long-standing interest
in the study of mutations. Knowledge of how quickly
mutations accumulate is critical to many areas of evo-
lutionary genetics, ranging from the quest to improve
evolutionary inference to the genetic basis of disease to
the advancement of our understanding of the chronology
of human evolution to the characterization of relation-
ships among populations and species. While there is
considerable uncertainty in historical mutation rate esti-
mates obtained from indirect methods, recent advances
in high-throughput sequencing have made it possible to
directly estimate mutation rates from parent-ospring
trios and multi-generation pedigrees. As a result of these
methodological breakthroughs, novel insights into the
genomic distribution of mutations as well as potential
underlying molecular mechanisms have recently emerged
in a number of dierent species. This symposium will
provide a forum to discuss novel scientic ndings in
this timely area of research.

PolygenicAdaptation
SMBE 2019, 21-25 July 2019, Manchester, UK
We would like to invite you to submit abstracts to sympo-
sium 'The genetic architecture of polygenic adaptation:
sweeps, small shifts and everything in between'.
Symposium overview: For decades the identication of
selected loci built on population genetic theory predict-
ing \selective sweep" signatures for selection targets
and anking sequences. Many empirical studies found
genomic patterns that are compatible with predictions
for hard, soft or incomplete sweeps. Nevertheless, most
traits are polygenic as demonstrated by many QTL
and GWAS studies. Empirical evidence for genomic
signatures of polygenic adaptation has been considered
dicult since only small shifts in the allele frequency of
(very) many contributing loci are expected. Recent theo-
retical and empirical work demonstrated, however, that
the selection signature of polygenic adaptation can result
in substantial allele frequency changes-similar to selec-
tive sweeps. Hence, the dynamics of alleles contributing
to polygenic adaptation can be traced experimentally,
leading to novel insights about adaptive processes. This
symposium brings together empirical and theoretical
researchers with the intention to explore the genomic
signatures of polygenic adaptation. Combining theory
with empirical data from natural populations and ex-
perimental populations this symposium will provide an
important contribution to develop new approaches for
the detection of polygenic adaptation.

EvolutionOfSenescence
Dear All,
We would like to invite you to the symposium on \The
Evolution of Senescence: From Theory to Molecular
Data", to be held during the SMBE meeting in Manch-
ester (21-25 July).
More information about the SMBE symposia can beApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 15
found here: http://smbe2019.org/programme/symposia-
overview/ Senescence (or ageing) is the progressive and
time-dependent decline in physiological function that
aects most organisms, leading to decreased rates of
survival and reproduction and, eventually, to death.
Senescence is a fascinating evolutionary problem and,
given an ageing population worldwide, it is arguably the
major biomedical challenge of the 21st century. Many
theories have been proposed to explain how senescence
evolves. The best known and widely accepted ones
are the Mutation Accumulation and the Antagonistic
Pleiotropy theories. However, the sheer diversity of age-
ing patterns across the tree of life, including organisms
that do not appear to experience senescence, suggests
that there is no single theory that can be reconciled with
all the data. Many theoretical and empirical studies
have tried to unravel the evolutionary and mechanistic
underpinnings of senescence, ranging from novel math-
ematical models to comparative studies of long and
short-lived organisms, including human supercentenar-
ians. We aim to bring together recent contributors of
innovative models, novel datasets and new experimental
and analytical approaches. Together, we will examine
how the latest developments can shed light on our un-
derstanding of the evolutionary and mechanistic causes
of ageing and, perhaps, how can they suggest strategies
to deal with ageing in our species.

Deadline for abstracts 17th March. Submit your ab-

sium overview: A question of central importance in
evolutionary genetics concerns how pathways and direc-
tions of evolutionary change are aected by the mapping
function between genotype and phenotype. This ques-
tion can now be addressed in earnest. The advent of
new experimental methods based on deep mutational
scanning has enabled direct high-throughput measure-
ments of tness for vast libraries of mutant genotypes.
In parallel, new theoretical research predicts how the
tness landscape should shape trajectories of evolution-
ary change. Reconstruction of the roads actually taken
by evolution, and comparisons to the roads not taken,
allows us to test hypotheses about the factors that inu-
ence pathways of change. Finally, patterns of sequence
divergence at large evolutionary timescales can provide
an independent view of the tness landscape shape and
dynamics. With this symposium, we will provide a
comprehensive perspective on how this combination of
approaches deepens our understanding of evolutionary
pathways over dierent timescales.

Microbiomes
We invite abstract submissions (for talks and poster)
for our symposium on the application of evolutionary16 EvolDir April 1, 2019
approaches to the study of microbial communities and
microbiomes at SMBE in Manchester 21-25 July 2019.
Deadline for abstracts 17th March. Submit your ab-
stracts here: http://smbe2019.org/abstracts/ Sympo-
sium overview: Microbial communities (i.e. micro-
biomes) shape ourselves and our environments. Our
interactions with these communities can alter our health,
our food sources, and the marine and soil environments
around which we live. In order to better understand
these communities, we must understand the evolution
of individual strains and species within them, the evolu-
tionary interactions (i.e. cooperation and competition)
between members, as well as how these collective com-
munities have evolved to interact with their environment
and/or host organism. Evolutionary studies of microbial
communities have historically been neglected. As such,
the aim of this symposia is to highlight those whose
research is making strides in combining the elds of evo-
lution and microbiology towards the study of microbial
communities. This symposia will focus on fostering the
novel approaches in this eld, including research which
may not be getting enough attention in the broader eld
of microbiome research. Talks will combine evolution,
ecology, and microbiology, in order to shape our under-
standing of the microbial communities which live in us,
around us, and in symbiosis with us.

MoleculesNeuronsBehavior
This is a callout to evolutionary biologists interested in
the molecular and neural basis of behavioral evolution.
We would like to encourage you to consider submitting
an abstract for our symposium at this year's SMBE
meeting in Manchester (July 21-25).
Deadline is coming up soon: 17th March Submission link:
http://smbe2019.org/abstracts/ Symposium overview:
Underlying the diversity of animal sensory capabili-
ties and behaviors are fascinating dierences that have
evolved within their nervous systems. While there has
been steady progress in understanding foundational
neurophysiology principles in model organisms, only
recently have the tools and resources become avail-able to study neural circuit evolution among diverse
species. These tools and approaches are now allow-
ing comparative studies aimed at integrating questions
about ne-scale molecular changes, neural architecture
modications, and behavioral evolution. As a result
of these rapidly developing methodologies and grow-
ing applications, a symposium on the molecular basis
of neural circuit and behavioral evolution would pro-
vide an opportune time to share recent results from
these research avenues. Our goal with the symposium
will be to highlight interdisciplinary work existing at
the interface between evolutionary thought (theory and
inference-based analyses) and functional characteriza-
tion (neurogenetics, molecular biology). We believe
that the symposium will be of general interest to the
conference attendees as it has great potential to be in-
formative on fundamental evolutionary topics including
the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic vari-
ation, the genetics of adaptation, speciation biology, and
behavior.

MSC-Phylogenomics
Dear all,
We are excited to invite you to submit abstracts of your
research to the symposium on \Phylogenomics under the
Multispecies Coalescent", to be held during the SMBE
meeting in Manchester, UK (21-25 July).
Invited speakers: Ziheng Yang, University College Lon-

(http://smbe2019.org/abstracts/). For more informa-
tion please visit: http://smbe2019.org/ Symposium
Overview: The coalescent has played a pivotal role
in molecular population genetics and has been widely
used for estimating population genetic parameters (i.e.,
population size, migration and recombination rates)April 1, 2019 EvolDir 17
from sequence data. The natural extension to mul-
tiple species, the multispecies coalescent (MSC), has
marked a paradigm shift in molecular systematics by
using gene-tree heterogeneity across the genome as a
source of information for species-tree inference. Using
MSC methods appears important when the species arose
through a radiative speciation process, perhaps accom-
panied by migration or introgression between species,
because those processes generate short branches in the
species tree and thus widespread species tree-gene tree
discordance. In the past 10 years, heuristic and full
likelihood (such as Bayesian MCMC) approaches under
the MSC have been developed. In this symposium we
will discuss the latest advances in MSC methods, such
as the development of new computational MCMC algo-
rithms, improvements to summary methods, divergence
time estimation, and large-scale analysis of real data.
We are looking forward to seeing you in Manchester!

OutreachInMolEvol
Dear all,
Are you interested in the practices and challenges of
communicating molecular evolution to broad audiences?
Join us at the symposium \ Outreach in Molecular Bi-
ology and Evolution - good practices and challenges"
taking place the SMBE
meeting in Manchester (21-25 July).
A key aspect of current research in the eld of Evolution
is the proper dissemination to stakeholders, politicians,
general public, and also other scientists. Successful
outreaching may help solve various societal issues par-
ticularly in an era of fake news: scientically literate
public are for example more supportive of the public
funding of science and of scientically driven practices
such conservation policies. Unfortunately, scientists
often fail to properly reach the public (or even a gen-
eral academic audience) particularly for what concerns
molecular evolutionary concepts. The communication
of Molecular Evolution concepts is extremely important,
but can be challenging. With this symposium we would
like to inspire the SMBE audience on how to do betteroutreach by providing with examples of great communi-
cators and outreach practices on a variety of molecular
evolutionary topics. We aim at providing concrete tools
and examples on how to best communicate research by
selecting talks from proven excellent SMBE outreachers,
by pointing toward pitfalls that should be avoided, and
to good practices that should be followed. We also aim
at providing with examples of alternative ways than con-
ference talks such as public engagement, citizen science,
media and social networking. We welcome contributions
from enthusiast molecular evolutionists, ranging from
student with new outreaching unconventional ideas to
mature academics with long history of communication.

Manchester SMBEMajorTransitions
Jul21-25
We would like to invite you to the symposium on \The
molecular basis of major transition in evolution", to be
held during the SMBE meeting in Manchester (21-25
July). More information about the SMBE symposia
can be found here: http://smbe2019.org/programme/-
symposia-overview/ The history of life on Earth shows
major evolutionary transitions, shifts in which new bio-
logical features emerged that dramatically changed the
biology of organisms. The endless forms most beauti-
ful we observe today are the result of these revolutions
that shaped the biology of the planet. These innovations
were at the centre of the seminal book \The Major Tran-
sitions in Evolution" by John Maynard Smith and E ors
Szathm ary, published nearly 25 years ago. They include
the origins of cells and sex, major endosymbiotic events,
or the rise of multicellularity and societies among oth-
ers. The abundance of genomic data, new evolutionary
algorithms, and emerging technologies - such as single-
cell sequencing - oer a timely opportunity to study
the molecular changes underlying most of these major
transitions. Recent research has showed the importance
of gene duplication (e.g., the origins of multicellularity),
the evolution of cell types (the rise of animals or the
nervous system), or the fusion of genomes from dierentApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 19
organisms (eukaryotes and photosynthesis). In this sym-
posium we will explore the molecular basis associated
with these transitions at dierent organisation levels,
from genes and cells to complete organisms.

The DL is end of june
more info aeeb.fr and twitter :EvolBiolMeetingMarseilles
The Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles is anApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 21
annual congress which has gathered high level experts
in evolutionary biology since its creation in 1997.
If the congress was initially a local meeting, it quickly
gained an important weight in the scientic life. Indeed,
whereas the number of participants has been increas-
ing, the geographical origin of the researchers has been
diversifying and widening year by year.
Today, the Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Mar-
seilles has reached a worldwide dimension and plays a
paramount role in the international scientic life: allow-
ing the gathering of high level specialists, it encourages
the exchange of ideas and stimulates the works of the
researchers all through the world.
The following subjects will be discussed:
* Evolutionary biology concepts and modeling; * Biodi-
versity and Systematics; * Comparative genomics ans
post-genomics (at all taxomic levels); * Functional phy-
logeny; * Environment and biological evolution; * Origin
of life and exobiology; * Non-adaptative versus adapta-
tive evolution; * The minorphyla: their usefulness
in evolutionary biology knowledge; * Convergent evolu-
tion * Evolution of complex traits (Evo-Devo)

MexicoCity PoeciliidEvolution
Sep24-26
This informs of the incoming Conference of Poeciliid
Biologists. This is a specialists meeting with a strong
focus on evolution, and indeed some Poeciliid sh such
as the guppy and the swordtail are paradigmatic species
in the study of the evolutionary consequences of sexual
selection and on the evolution of life histories.
Dear all
We are organising the 8th Conference of Poeciliid Bi-
ologists, to take place on the 24-26 of September 2019
in Mexico City, at the main campus of the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).
As in previous editions, this meeting will gather experts
who use species of Poeciliid shes to address, mainly,
evolutionary questions, or questions about other issues
(e.g. conservation) seen through an evolutionary optic.
Information on the venue, program, submission and
registration forms can be found here:

have been applying both theory and empirical work,
including genomic and genetic studies, to untangle the
evolutionary eects of the amount and timing of sexual
and asexual reproduction.

Turku ESEB PolygenicAdaptation
Aug19-24
We would like to invite you to submit abstracts to
symposium S18 ~OThe genetic architecture of polygenic
adaptation: sweeps, small shifts and everything in be-
tween ~O.
Symposium overview: For decades the identication of
selected loci built on population genetic theory predict-
ing^Oselective sweep ~O signatures for selection targetsand anking sequences. Many empirical studies found
genomic patterns that are compatible with predictions
for hard, soft or incomplete sweeps. Nevertheless, most
traits are polygenic as demonstrated by many QTL
and GWAS studies. Empirical evidence for genomic
signatures of polygenic adaptation has been considered
dicult since only small shifts in the allele frequency of
(very) many contributing loci are expected. Recent theo-
retical and empirical work demonstrated, however, that
the selection signature of polygenic adaptation can result
in substantial allele frequency changes-similar to selec-
tive sweeps. Hence, the dynamics of alleles contributing
to polygenic adaptation can be traced experimentally,
leading to novel insights about adaptive processes. This
symposium brings together empirical and theoretical
researchers with the intention to explore the genomic
signatures of polygenic adaptation. Combining theory
with empirical data from natural populations and ex-
perimental populations this symposium will provide an
important contribution to develop new approaches for
the detection of polygenic adaptation.

UppsalaU ConictAndCooperation
May21-22
Just a reminder, registration is open for The Evolution of
Cooperation and Conict: from theory to experimental
evaluation.
Research on conict and cooperation has recently
gained momentum due to major theoretical and ge-
nomic breakthroughs that have expanded the re-
search horizon. Interestingly, even though the con-
ict and cooperation communities employ many of the
same research tools and frameworks, they often pro-
ceed independently of each other. Our goal in this
conference is to integrate these two complimentary
communities to build new and productive links be-
tween them. More details are available at: https://-
evolutioncoopconictconference.wordpress.com/ The
conference will take place May 21-22 2019 at Uppsala
University.

Australia SeastarGenomics
We are seeking expressions of interest for two PhD
positions for a project investigating genomic patterns
of population outbreak dynamics in Crown-of-Thorns
Seastars on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.Crown-of-Thorns Seastars (CoTS) are among the great-
est threats to the corals of the Great Barrier Reef. These
coral predators follow a boom-bust cycle and diminish
live coral abundance in locations suering CoTS out-
breaks. An Australian Research Council funded project
will be examining key hypotheses regarding the spatio-
temporal dynamics of outbreaking populations, drawing
upon genomic and eDNA enabled tools and method-
ologies. We are seeking highly motivated individuals32 EvolDir April 1, 2019
with experience or strong interests in some combina-
tion of population genomics, landscape genetics, inva-
sive species/pathogen spread dynamics, and population
modelling. There may be opportunities to participate
in eld collections dependant on interest and research
diving qualications. This project is an international
collaboration between Cynthia Riginos (University of
Queensland, Australia), Sven Uthicke (Australian Insti-
tute of Marine Sciences), and Gert Worheide (Ludwig
Maximilians Universit at Munc hen, Germany).
PhD students would be enrolled and primarily based at
the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Qld, Australia.
PhD students are likely to take primary responsibility
for empirical genomic components of the project with
one student focusing on larval quantication of plank-
ton samples via qPCR and spending substantial time
at AIMS in Townville, Qld, and a second student fo-
cusing on population genomics of the current outbreak.
Competitive applicants would have demonstrated rel-
evant research experience in evolution and population
genetics (Masters or Honours degree with associated
publications) and some experience with bioinformat-
ics and computer scripting (R, python, perl or other
relevant language). Full funding (living expenses and
fees) for one international student will be provided by
UQ. Strongly qualied domestic (Australian and New
Zealand) applicants will also be considered but must
be eligible and competitive for obtaining an Australian
Postgraduate Award. Expression s of interest should
include a CV including 3 potential referees and an un-
dergraduate transcript.
Please contact Cynthia Riginos (c.riginos@uq.edu.au)
for further details. Review of expressions of interest will

ParasiteLifeCycleEvolution
POSITION A PhD position in parasite genetics and
evolution is available at the Humboldt University in
Berlin. The position is grant funded for up to 3 years
(65% on payscale E13 TV-L HU).
PROJECT Many parasites have bizarre life cycles in
which they infect very dierent hosts in succession, e.g.
an invertebrate, then a sh, and then a bird. How do
they survive and thrive in dissimilar hosts? What ge-
netic mechanisms enable these massive ontogenetic niche
shifts? The applicant will investigate these questions
with experiments using parasitic worms and transcrip-
tomic methods. A primary goal will be to understand
the genetic mechanisms enabling parasites to infect very
dierent kinds of hosts within a life cycle. The project
provides the opportunity to develop skills in experimen-
tal design, next-generation sequencing, big data manip-
ulation, advanced analytics, reproducible research, and
scientic publishing. The position is funded for 3 years
by the DFG and can serve as the basis for a doctoral
dissertation.
REQUIREMENTS Completed degree in Biology, Molec-
ular Biology, Bioinformatics, Genetics, or a related dis-
cipline Strong interest in parasites, evolutionary biology,
and/or genetics Anity for statistics, data analysis, and
programming (in R or Python) Previous work with NGS
data a plus Experience with animal experiments and ne
motor skills to handle small organisms Creativity and
a willingness to develop ideas independently Excellent
English skills, German helpful
LOCATION The project is based at the Institute for
Molecular Parasitology at the Humboldt University-
Berlin and includes collaborators from the Leibniz-
Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries,
the University of M unster, and the University of Edin-
burgh. The Institute for Molecular Parasitology is in34 EvolDir April 1, 2019
central Berlin and located near the University's med-
ical school and other research institutions. The labs

LundU SpeciesExtinction
Doctoral student in Biology
Lunds Universitet, Naturvetenskapliga fakulteten, Biol-
ogiska institutionen
Lund University was founded in 1666 and is repeatedly
ranked among the world??s top 100 universities. The
University has 40 000 students and 7 400 sta based in
Lund, Helsingborg and Malm??. We are united in our
eorts to understand, explain and improve our world
and the human condition.
The Faculty of Science conducts research and educa-
tion within Biology, Astronomy, Physics, Geosciences,
Chemistry, Mathematics and Environmental Sciences.
The Faculty is organized into nine departments, gath-
ered in the northern campus area. The Faculty has
approximately 1500 students, 330 PhD students and
700 employees.
Project description: The fact that climate change can
cause extinction of species is established, but our abil-
ity to study and quantify causality of such eects is
challenging. Reliable predictions about future extinc-
tions are thus also elusive. The aim of this project is
to develop theory and quantitative methods that can
improve our understanding and prediction of ecologicaland evolutionary processes that structures and main-
tains biological communities. The Ph.D. student should
thus have basic knowledge of how ecological interactions,
evolutionary processes, and dispersal of organisms in a
variable environment can aect the structure and dy-
namics of communities. A particular focus will be on
the phylogenetic dierence between communities (phy-
lobetadiversity), a metric of community structure that
contains signals of both ecological, evolutionary and
biogeographical processes. The student will formulate
general theory of the causal link between process and
phylobetadiversity through analysis of spatially explicit
eco-evolutionary models. Theory will also be tested
against empirical patterns through parametrization and
validation of the models, given available data. There
will be a particular focus on hummingbird community
data from the Andes, which is a global biodiversity
hotspot. By tting models to hummingbird data, we
aim to quantify the processes that have structured this
unique ecosystem, and possibly predict how this system
may respond to future conditions.
The project is at its start-up phase and part of the start-
up of Dr. Mikael Pontarp??s research group at Lund
University. The student will thus have the opportunity
to contribute to the prole of the project as well as
the direction it may take. To be able to utilize such
an opportunity the student needs to be independent
and persistent. In addition, to succeed in a theoretical
and quantitative project like this, the student needs
experience in and interest of dierential equation mod-
els, agent-based simulations, evolutionary analysis, and
statistics. The project is expected to be carried out in
collaboration with Prof. ??ke Br??nnstr??m at Ume??
Univeristy, Sweden who will serve as assistant supervi-
sor.
Requirements and qualications: The candidate should
have a Masters degree in ecology/evolutionary biol-
ogy. Alternatively, the candidate may have a degree in
Physics, Mathematics or computer science. Knowledge
of interacting ecological, evolutionary and biogeographi-
cal processes that underpin community structure and
dynamics is desirable. Candidates also need to have
prociency, but not necessarily documented, in working
with mathematical modeling, computation and comput-
ers and programming, e.g. in Matlab, Python, Julia,
C++, etc. Knowledge of model parameterization and
validation and Bayesian statistics is also desirable. Im-
portant qualities in a successful candidate are outgoing,
curiosity, problem-solving, structured, independent and
persistent.
Eligibility: Students with basic eligibility for third-cycle
studies are those who- have completed a second-cycle
degree- have completed courses of at least 240 credits, ofApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 35

Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology
I am looking for a PhD student to join my research
group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology.
PhD position (3 years): Rapid adaptation to environ-
mental change
Populations that are threatened by environmental
change may escape extinction through adaptive evo-
lution (\evolutionary rescue"). The goal of the project
is to develop mathematical models to describe the eco-
evolutionary dynamics of rapid adaptation and to deter-
mine the probability of evolutionary rescue. Depending
on the interests of the students, the models can be sit-
uated in an ecological context or in a medical context
(evolution of drug resistance, see also below).
The ideal student will be one who is interested in apply-
ing mathematical modeling to gain insights into biologi-
cal problems and is enthusiastic about math as well as
about biology. The successful student will learn how to
set up and analyse theoretical models to describe bio-logical processes and become skilled in using branching
process theory as a modeling tool. Applicants should
have a background in mathematics, physics, biology,
computer science or a related eld. Good quantitative
skills are essential. Prior experience in mathematical
modeling and knowledge of a programming language (C,
C++, Java, R, Python...) is an advantage.
Association with the International Max Planck Research
School (IMPRS) for Evolutionary Biology is possible.
Interested students are encouraged to (also) apply
to the International Max Planck Research School
for Evolutionary Biology (deadline: March 24):
www.evolbio.mpg.de/imprs Working environment
The student will join a young group at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology. In our group, we
focus on exploring the role of stochasticity in evolu-
tion. In the context of resistance evolution, we closely
collaborate with experimental microbiologists at the
University of Kiel. The group is part of the Department
of Evolutionary Theory. The student will hence be part
of a larger community of researchers working at the
intersection of mathematics and biology with many op-
portunities to take part in journal clubs, reading groups
etc.
The Max Planck Institute is a lively institute with three
departments (Evolutionary Theory, Microbial Popula-
tion Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and several ad-
ditional research groups. It hosts several workshops
per year and continuously welcomes international short-
term and long-term visitors, creating a stimulating and
positive research environment. We maintain close in-
teractions with Kiel University and belong to the Kiel
Evolution Center. The area is a center of evolutionary
biology in Germany.

Sciences at Mississippi State University. We seek a moti-
vated student interested in interactions between insects,
microbial and multicellular parasites, and defensive sym-

Understanding how parasites interact with the insectinnate immune system is fundamental to our knowl-
edge of insect health and disease transmission. These
interactions are often thought of as antagonistic, but
in many insects, microbes help defend the host against
infection. In our lab, we use Drosophila as a model
system to investigate partnerships between insects and
defensive microbes. We work to understand the mecha-
nisms underlying microbe-conferred defenses, how they
have evolved, and how they impact the evolution of
parasites and pathogens.
Available projects focus on the evolution of toxin speci-
city in Drosophila-Spiroplasma defensive symbiosis,
the role of domesticated RNA virus genes in insect im-
munity, and the evolution of Wolbachia-mediated RNA
virus defense in insects.
Interested applicants should contact Dr. Matthew

SexDierencesAndAdaptation
An opportunity is available for a PhD student to join the
research groups of Carla Sgr ~A^A2and Tim Connallon at
Monash University (Melbourne, Australia).
We are seeking a creative and motivated student who
wishes to carry out original research on the evolution of
local adaptation. Species with broad geographic ranges
have evolved the capacity to thrive under a wide range
of environmental conditions that vary with latitude, al-
titude, and seasonality. Each species must therefore
cope with variable climatic conditions (e.g., heat stress,
water availability) and variation in resources, predators,
prey, and parasites. Environmental dierences among38 EvolDir April 1, 2019
locations in a species' range generate local patterns of
natural selection, which drive evolutionary diversica-
tion among populations of a species.
Processes of local adaptation are more complex ' and
interesting ' in species with separate sexes. Females
and males interact with their environments in dierent
ways, which can generate dierent patterns of selection
between the sexes. Sex dierences in selection and the
genetic basis of ecologically important traits directly
impact the capacity of populations to adapt to local
conditions, with potential ecological consequences for
species' range limits and extinction susceptibility.
We have an ongoing collaboration that seeks to address
several open-ended questions about the roles of sex dif-
ferences and environmental change in adaptive evolution.
These questions include: ^A To what extent do geographi-
cally variable patterns of natural selection dier between
the sexes, and do such dierences promote or inhibit
local adaptation? ^A What are the contributions of
dierent regions of a genome ' including sex chromo-
somes, autosomes, and the mitochondrial genome ' to
local adaptation? ^A To what extent do the sexes dier
in phenotypic plasticity, and how do such dierences
aect population persistence, the evolution of species'
range limits, and the expression of sexual dimorphism?
^A How do variable environmental conditions impact
the genetic architecture of female and male traits, and
how might this inuence adaptive potential in changing
environments?
We address these questions through a combination of
new theory development and lab and eld experimental
work on Drosophila populations from eastern Australia,
which span tropical climates in the north to highly sea-
sonal temperate climates in the south. Representative
publications can be found below.
The successful candidate will contribute to this collabo-
ration. Specic research plans will be developed with the
student, and tailored to match their interests, strengths
and goals. Individuals with a background in biology
or a related eld are invited to apply, and those with
strong quantitative skills are particularly encouraged.
A deep interest in evolutionary biology is essential.
The successful candidate will be fully funded for 3.5 years
(full tuition waiver plus stipend) for full time research
and no teaching requirements; funded opportunities to
contribute to teaching will, however, be available for
candidates who wish to do so. Expenses for research,
coursework, and conference attendance will also be cov-
ered. Both domestic and international students are
welcome to apply.
Monash University is a member of Australia's Groupof Eight coalition, and is internationally recognized for
excellence in research and teaching. The School of
Biological Sciences is home to a collegial and interdisci-
plinary research environment, with strengths in ecology,
genetics and evolutionary biology. The Monash doctoral

Project title: Omics based modeling of marine plankton
populations

search Federation \Global Ocean System Ecology and
Evolution")

voirproposition.pl?matricule prop $405&site ^A'umR#version
Deadline: April 14, 2019
Start date: September to December 2019
Qualication: MS in Biological sciences with demon-
strated knowledge in network modeling and skills in
computational biology.
Context:
Changes in marine plankton communities driven by en-
vironmental variability impact the marine food web and
global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other ele-
ments. To predict and assess these community shifts
and their consequences, it is essential i) to describe func-
tional relationships driving population assemblages and
ii) to quantify their relative contribution in the main
functional ecosystem traits and services. In order to
predict these features, one could use large scale ocean40 EvolDir April 1, 2019
imaging methods (mainly based on satellites) to pre-
dict photosynthetic activity. However, these techniques
are limited to oversimplied biological processes but
do not apply to more complex features such as vertical
carbon uxes, nitrogen xation or production of sulfur
compounds, all of such having great impacts at the
global scale. Omics-based techniques represent a great
promise to circumvent these limitations, for instance by
providing access to populations composition, functional
abilities and activities.
Yet, major caveats remain. In particular, gene-centric
based approaches describe complex organisms communi-
ties (metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) but does
not allow to capture biologically insights at the level of
organisms when no closely related reference genomes are
available, which represents a major drawback for study-
ing the global ocean. To overcome this shortcoming,
bioinformatics methods have already been designed to
reconstruct genomic data from environmental sequences
for bacteria and archeae (i.e., Metagenome based As-
sembly of Genomes). However, they poorly perform on
eukaryotes, partly because of their large genome size
and complexity.
This thesis project proposes to bridge these methodolog-
ical gaps for plankton eukaryotic systems, in particular
thanks to the Tara Ocean dataset. Indeed, the Tara
Ocean project (1) revealed the catalog of more than
41 million of bacterial and archeal genes (2), and 116
millions of eukaryote plankton unigenes (cDNA contigs)
(3), both with a high proportion of newly described
genes without known homologs. Again, the paucity of
reference sequences could explain this observation for eu-
karyotic marine plankton, for which very few references
are described (4).
To identify major eukaryotic insights, a canopy cluster-
ing (5) approach has been applied to group transcripts
with similar abundance variation proles across the
collection of samples, generating MetaGenome based
Transcriptomes (MGT), corresponding to organismal
transcriptomes (6). With this method, it is then feasi-
ble for eukaryotes to move from environmental-based
gene-centric dataset to organism-level entities, and then
to populations. As a complementary analysis, one ad-
vocates herein to build a complementary metabolic net-
work to automatically identify the main phenotypic
features. Finally, one will extract from the metabolic
model the major traits of interest that will be used in
state-of-the-art ocean circulation model. Focusing on
phenotypic characteristics of plankton communities, i.e.
the so called plankton functional traits, or plankton
functional types (PFT) (7) are indeed an eective way
to link community structure and composition to ecosys-
tem functioning (8) (9). These have already been usedto connect large scale description of the oceans with
major biogeochemical cycles. By dening essential gene
functions specic to each PFT class, it would be possible
to connect meta-omics data and functional models with
global models.
This thesis will foster and organize all these resources
and methods within a single bioinformatic paradigm, in
order to target the following aims:
i) apply metabolism reconstruction approaches to de-
scribe the global biological functions of these eukaryotic
marine organisms through the analysis of the individual
genes functions ii) integrate the individual described
metabolisms to describe the sampled populations in the
context of the samples environmental parameters, iii)
identify eukaryotic genes which can be associated with
the dierent main plankton functional traits, extending
already available data (10) and iv) connect at the global
scale these quantiable omics elements with the oceans
level biogeochemical models.
Steps i) and ii) will be undergone in collaboration with

AnnelidBacterialSymbiosis
*** PhD position available; Queen Mary University of
London***
The genomic basis of bacterial symbiosis in deep-sea
annelid worms
Background Mutualistic relationships between bacteria
and complex organisms have repeatedly evolved and this
has allowed host organisms to exploit new environments
and foods. One of the most extreme and fascinating
cases of symbiosis in the animal kingdom is observed in
annelid worms of the genus Riftia and Osedax, which
are able to live in particularly extreme environments
including deep sea hydrothermal vents and carcases
thanks to bacteria from the environment that they ac-
quire as juveniles. This ultimately induces a drastic
developmental change where they degenerate their guts
and rely entirely on the bacterial symbionts to produceApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 41
the essential nutrients they require for survival in those
hostile environments. Which cellular and genetic mech-
anisms control this bacterial symbiosis? How did these
mechanisms evolve? How did its change contribute to
animal evolution?
- In this project you would rigorously answer these ques-
tions sequencing and comparing the genome of these
symbiotic worms with their closest asymbiotic coun-
terparts. - You would have access to a large genomic
database, eld collections and in-house live organisms
to fuel your investigation. - You would gain experience
of molecular techniques (nucleic acid extraction, next
generation sequencing), bioinformatics (e.g. genome as-
sembly, RNA-seq analyses, gene family evolution), and
statistics. - You will be encouraged to develop your own
ideas and hypotheses.
The studentship is fully funded and available to EU and
UK citizens. It will cover tuition fees as well as provide
an annual tax-free maintenance allowance for 3 years at
Research Councils UK rates ( £17,009 in 2019-20).
Skills preferred In a multidisciplinary project like this,
candidates are unlikely to have a background in all dis-
ciplines involved. The most important qualication is
motivation, enthusiasm and that the project appeals
to you. However, previous computational experience
would be a plus. We can envisage strong candidates
coming through a variety of routes including:
- practical molecular biology - evolutionary theory and
phylogenomics - computational biology
To apply, students should have a rst class degree or
have received a MSc in a relevant eld (i.e. marine biol-
ogy, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics) or are about
to nish their MSc.

*Socio-economic and scientic context : *
The \cost of reproduction" refers to the tradeo be-
tween reproduction and lifespan. This cost has been
described in a multitude of species, ranging from ies
to humans, but this cost sill debated. This tradeo
and its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated
and still captivate researchers working in ecology, evo-
lution, physiology but also in medical sciences. The
theory posits that when endogenous resources are allo-
cated to reproduction, they are less available for somatic
or repair functions that are necessary for stress resis-
tance. As a result, reproductive activity would make42 EvolDir April 1, 2019
the organism more vulnerable to environmental stress,
reducing therefore its life expectancy. Reproductive
activity should therefore generate increased susceptibil-
ity to environmental stress, but this relationship is not
yet formally established. These notions denes frame-
work of the PhD project that perfectly ts with the
goals of international laboratory LIA PRICES (https:/-
/ecobio.univ-rennes1.fr/LIA-PRICES/) starting in 2019
between Ecobio (Rennes) and Zoophysiology (Aarhus)
for 5 years.
*Assumptions and questions *
Evidence supports the presumption of a tradeo be-
tween reproduction and stress resistance. For example,
in Drosophila ies, oogenesis is blocked when environ-
mental or nutritional conditions become unfavorable. To
pass the stress of the winter, Drosophila females enter in
reproductive diapause (block of oogenesis). Nutritional
restriction often increases longevity and promotes stress
tolerance, while reducing fecundity or fully blocking
gametogenesis in some cases. Other studies report that
virgin females, whose oogenesis is deeply restricted, live
signicantly longer and are more resistant to stress than
gravid females. All these elements support the hypothe-
sis that reduction / block of reproduction may be a key
factor of stress tolerance but unerlying mechanisms of
such a tradeo remain to be elucidated.
* The main steps of the thesis and scientic procedure *
The physiological mechanisms underlying the cost of
reproduction are unknown and likely complex. To ad-
dress these issues, the Drosophila model is particularly
suitable because its stress tolerance is well described, its
longevity can easily be accessible in laboratory and its re-
production can be experimentally manipulated. We will
explore and characterize this tradeo mainly via inhibi-
tion / stimulation of the reproduction activity. Oogene-
sis will be inhibited by multiples approaches 1) pharma-
cological treatments (supplementation with rapamycin,
phloroglucinol), 2) genetics (sterile mutants: Ovo, InR,
Chico, Orb), 3) environmental treatments (induction of
reproductive diapause and virginity) and 4) nutritional
manipulations (protein and essential nutrients decien-
cies). In addition, oogenesis will be stimulated via 1)
hormonal (juvenile hormone analogs) and 2) nutritional
treatments (active yeast supplementation), and that,
using various fertile or sterile lines. We will study con-
sequences of all these manipulations on longevity and
tolerance to environmental stresses (biotic and abiotic),
with a particular focus on thermal stress. Part of the
PhD project will take place at Aarhus University as part
of the international laboratory LIA PRICES (2019-2023)
(the duration of the mobility will be according to the
wishes of the candidate).*Methodological and technical approaches considered *
We will study the ecophysiological mechanisms under-
lying variations in longevity and tolerance to environ-
mental stresses in ies whose reproduction has been
manipulated, via molecular (exploratory or targeted
transcriptomic), metabolic (metabolomic proling) and
physiological (water / ionic / energy homeostasis and
hormonal balance) approaches.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION The overall aim of this
project is to characterize microbiomes in prehistoric
remains from humans and wild megafauna, in order
to investigate the interaction between population dy-
namics and prehistoric diseases. More specically, the
project will investigate to what extent prehistoric con-
tacts between populations lead to spread of diseases, and
whether pandemic outbreaks could have caused demo-
graphic declines or even extinctions. We will be working
on ancient humans that are several thousand years old,
as well as several species of the Ice Age Megafauna (e.g.
woolly rhino, mammoth, wolf and cave lion). All ge-
netic data for the project has already been generated.
The project is part of a \paired PhD student" scheme
together with the Department of Mathematics, where
a second PhD student will be developing novel tools
for the bioinformatic analyses. For this project, good
knowledge in bioinformatics and experience of handling
genomic data in a Linux environment are important qual-
ications. The PhD student will join the the new Centre
of Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, which is a joint venturebetween Stockholm University (SU) and the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (SMNH). For further details,

PhD /postdoc in Computational Phylogenetics
ZHAW W adenswil, Switzerland
With the advent of new generation sequencing (NGS)
bioinformatic methods must keep pace to provide ro-
bust scalable solutions to analyse large sets of molecular
sequences. The evolutionary history of molecules is
described by a tree structure called phylogeny, which
is inferred from genomic sequences. Phylogenies are
used for testing biological hypotheses with applications
ranging from medicine to ecology. Phylogeny inference
usually relies on an inferred alignment of homologous
sequences, which ' in turn ' relies on a guide-tree reect-
ing their ancestral relationships. The goal is to address
this apparent circularity so to improve the reliability
of phylogenetic analyses. Ideally alignment and tree
should be inferred jointly. For example, please see our
recent article: Maiolo M, Zhang X, Gil M, Anisimova

Sydney NationalTreeGenomics
Dear all
We have two PhD positions in Australia on i) evolu-
tionary genomics and ii) computer science. It is open
to international applicants with at least one 9 month
research project under their belt (e.g. Honours, M. Res,
MPhil, MSc with 50% research, work experience etc).
The National Tree Genomics Project (Western Sydney
University, University of Adelaide, University of Queens-
land, Queensland University of Technology, Queensland
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries QDAF, Jain Ir-
rigation in India) is integrating new genomic, physiology,
and molecular biology approaches for key model species
(avocado, almonds, citrus, macadamia, mango) to breed
the next generation of fruit and nut trees. To comple-
ment our team, we are seeking to support exceptional
PhD students to lead projects within our portfolio.
The rst project will use comparative genomic analysis
of assembled genomes, in the context of our molecular
breeding program, to determine what gene set makes
a 'good' fruit tree crop, developing new approaches for
analysing (allelic) gene expression x genotype interac-
tions, or investigating how environments can inuence
the development of complex tree traits.
The second project will use cutting-edge machine learn-
ing approaches to discover how complex biological traits
evolve, develop, and respond to a changing environ-
ment. The aim is to generate fundamental knowledge
on fruit tree development (such as owering, branch-ing, pathogen and drought resistance) by integrating
diverse data types (genetic, physiological, ecological) in
a mathematical framework of the student's design.
For both projects, the student will be mainly based
at Western Sydney and co-supervised by the Hawkes-
bury Institute for the Environment, Centre for Research
Mathematics (Western Sydney University) and Univer-
sity of Queensland (Brisbane).
It is a two stage application starting with a short EOI,
deadline 12th of April.

UAberdeen MicrobialEvolution
Funded PhD studentship in microbial evolution at the
University of Aberdeen (Scotland, UK): ?Experimental
evolution of Thaumarchaeota?
The fundamental aim of this project is to determine
the process of adaptive diversication and associated
trade-os in tness, by studying microbial evolution
experimentally.
A 4-year PhD studentship in microbial evolution, start-
ing in Sept 2019, is now open for application at the
University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The deadline for
applications is April 16th 2019 and this studentship is
available to UK and EU students. The PhD project is
funded by the Royal Society and will target key evo-
lutionary questions with a special focus on Thaumar-
chaeota to align with the research thematic of the Uni-
versity of Aberdeen Nitrication Group.
Using microbes to test theory in evolutionary biology
has led to major scientic advances. In particular, micro-
bial experimental evolution has allowed analysis of both
microbial adaptation (genomic and phenotypic changes)
and diversication (phenotypic evolution and lineage-
splitting) using controlled environments, through in-
creased understanding of the nature and frequency of
genomic substitutions, their eects on microbial tness
and the mechanisms by which diversity is created and
maintained in microbial populations. These concepts
were established from studies of bacteria, fungi, viruses
and phage, focussing mainly on a few bacterial model
organisms (1, 2). However, an entire domain of life,
the Archaea (3), has largely been ignored by evolution-
ary biologists, despite their widespread distribution in
natural environments, high abundance and essential con-
tribution to global ecosystem functioning that sustains
the planet. A priori, no clear reasons for dierent evo-
lutionary processes between archaea and bacteria can
be advanced, but their ancient evolutionary divergence
(despite the existence of lateral gene transfer between
domains) suggests that the relevance of established mi-
crobial models of adaptation and diversication should
be tested on these organisms if they are to be considered
universal. Indeed, despite the global importance and
diversity of archaea, our understanding of the ecological
and evolutionary processes generating their high diver-
sity is scarce compared to that of eukaryotes and, to a
lesser extent, bacteria.This project will focus on members of a key microbial
phylum, the Thaumarchaeota (4, 5), which are abundant
and ubiquitous and perform a critical ecosystem func-
tion, ammonia oxidation. The distribution of natural
microbial communities is inuenced by environmental
characteristics, and pH is the major abiotic factor in-
uencing extant thaumarchaeotal niche specialisation
(4), and has also inuenced their diversication and
patterns of lineage formation through deep evolutionary
time (5).
This project will involve cultivation of Thaumarchaeota
(6) followed by the analysis of their mutation rate under
dierent environmental conditions and in relation with
DNA repair mechanisms. The project will be comple-
mented by studying the evolution of these microbes ex-
perimentally by imposing environmental changes under
controlled conditions, and the evolutionary mechanisms
of adaptation and diversication as well as the existence
of trade-os will be determined using genomic and t-
ness changes over time. The project oers opportunities
for innovative ideas and the student will be expected
to contribute to the development of the project, includ-
ing on scientic testable hypotheses and subsequent
experimental design to apply.
The PhD student will join a dynamic team of re-
searchers led by Dr C?cile Gubry-Rangin (https://-
www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/proles/c.rangin) and will benet
from the presence of strong groups in the department
working on related topics as well as being embedded in
a strong network of international collaborations. The
University of Aberdeen provides an excellent scientic
environment, state-of-the-art technological support fa-
cilities and diverse training opportunities for all aspects
of research and for transferable academic and generic
skills.
Candidate should have (or expected to achieve) a mini-
mum of 2:1 Honours degree, ideally (but not required)
an MSc in evolution, ecology or related, strong theoret-
ical skills and enthusiasm for learning and developing
microbial experimental evolution.
Application Process: Formal application should be made

Study opportunities in marine sedimentary ancient DNA
(aDNA), available now.
Supervisor: Dr Linda Armbrecht, Australian Centre for
Ancient DNA (ACAD) at the University of Adelaide,
Australia
Marine phytoplankton are globally important microor-
ganisms that live in the ocean's surface. When these
tiny organisms die, they sink to the seaoor and over
time build up complex layers in the ocean sediments.
By extracting ancient DNA from such sediments, past
phytoplankton communities can be reconstructed, pro-
viding information on past environmental conditions
and climate. This novel knowledge about past marine
community adaptation to previous regional and global
warming periods helps inform predictions of future ma-
rine ecosystem resilience guiding management eorts of
marine ecosystems during present-day climate change.
Study opportunities on all levels (Internships, Honours,
Masters, PhD) are available with regard to the recon-
struction of Antarctic phytoplankton communities and
their responses to variations in climate. Sediment cores
used for this research were collected o East and West
Antarctica, and are dated to the Last Glacial Maxi-
mum ( ~20-25 kyr). This research is highly interdisci-
plinary, spanning across marine science, biological/palae-
oceanography, and palaeo-genomics, and a good under-
standing in at least one of these disciplines is required.
Study activities include, for example, marine eld-work
(topic-dependent), laboratory tasks, bioinformatics and
data analysis.
International students should note that they must

Modelling Brain-Like Intelligence in an evolutionary
context for AI applications
https://www.ndaphd.com/phds/project/modelling-
brain-like-intelligence-in-an-evolutionary-context-for-
ai-applications/?p107744 A challenge for AI research
is to operate autonomously in natural environments.
Although many organisms can respond adaptively to
the natural world in milliseconds, the computational
complexity in interpreting natural images is an on-going
fundamental problem. One suggested solution is to
pursue research on Brain-Like Intelligence (Sendho,
Koerner & Sporns, 2009) as a means of creating
biologically-inspired solutions that might provide a
generalised approach to the computational demands of
multiple sensory inputs and potential motor outputs.
The promising perspective to develop Brain-Like
AI has been hampered by the mistaken view that
intelligence is a hallmark of 'highly evolved creatures';
instead, the pluralistic view that all creatures have
evolved adaptive sensory and motor capabilities for
dierent environments might better endow autonomous
robots with the exibility necessary to use dierent
computational approaches attuned to the environment.
This project is associated with the UKRI CDT in
Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI (ART-
AI), which is looking for its rst cohort of at least 10
students to start in September 2019. Students will
be fully funded for 4 years (stipend, UK/EU tuition
fees and research support budget). Further details
can be found here: http://www.bath.ac.uk/research-
centres/ukri-centre-for-doctoral-training-in-accountable-
responsible-and-transparent-ai/ .
The approach will be multisensory and task-based, to
understand the best biological approaches (e.g., seeing
or hearing?) to solve natural computational problems
(e.g., how to nd food). The supervision for this project
will be interdisciplinary and thus provide training and48 EvolDir April 1, 2019
theory from the perspectives of (psychology, primary su-
pervisor Dr Michael Proulx), evolutionary neuroscience

experience. Applicants should hold, or expect to receive,
the equivalent of a UK First Class or good Upper Second
Class Honours degree in a relevant eld. A master's

Eects of captive breeding on personality and cogni-
tion in the North African houbara bustard - Master by
Research
https://www.ndaphd.com/phds/project/eects-of-
captive-breeding-on-personality-and-cognition-in-the-
north-african-houbara-bustard-psychology-masters-by-research-fees-only/?p107393 Project Description The
University of Exeter's College of Life and Environmen-
tal Sciences, in partnership with Reneco, is inviting
applications for a fees-only scholarship to commence in
May 2019 or as soon as possible thereafter. For eligible
students the studentship will cover UK/EU tuition fees
for 2 years full-time, or pro rata for part-time study.
The student will be based in the College of Life and
Environmental Sciences at the Streatham Campus in
Exeter. However, eldwork will take place in Eastern
Morocco (ECWP, Missour). Besides Morocco, the
student will also be expected to spend time at the
Reneco HQ in Abu Dhabi, UAE, to conduct data
analysis under the supervision of Dr Enrico Sorato and
present research outcomes.
The endangered North African houbara bustard
(Chlamydotis undulata undulata) has been declining
drastically throughout its range due to overhunting and
habitat degradation. Since the late 90s the species
has been the subject of a large-scale captive breeding
programme at the Emirates Center for Wildlife Propa-
gation (ECWP), Missour, with currently more than 15
000 birds produced annually for release in the wild. The
intention of this rearing and release is to restore wild
populations and supplement hunting grounds for regu-
lated falconry (http://www.houbarafund.org). However,
potential genetic adaptation to captivity may lead to
changes in behaviour and life history traits, which may
be detrimental in the wild.
The successful applicant will investigate the eects of
captive-breeding on personality traits and cognition,
by conducting behavioural tests on captive houbaras
throughout ontogeny. By testing individuals with vary-
ing known histories of captive breeding, and by using
quantitative genetics statistical methods, we will assess
the extent of adaptation to captivity and disentangle
the relative impact of additive genetic, parental and
environmental eects. This study will contribute to
understanding how selection shapes variation in per-
sonality and cognitive traits, and could help improve
breeding protocols to avoid adaptation to captivity. This
project oers multidisciplinary academic training in be-
havioural/cognitive ecology, as well as practical applica-
tions for conservation of an endangered species.
In addition to funding fees at the University of Exeter,
Reneco is also expected to provide the student with re-
search costs, travel, accommodation and a small stipend
for living costs in the eld. The scholarship will be
awarded on the basis of merit for 2 years of full-time
study to commence in May 2019. The collaboration
with the named project partner is subject to contract.
This award provides annual funding to cover UK/EU
tuition fees only. Students who pay international tuition50 EvolDir April 1, 2019
fees are eligible to apply but should note that the award
will only provide payment for part of the international
tuition fee Informal enquiries about the project can be

Resending this advert as something broke the links in
the email of 2/28/19:
PhD position 'Horizontal Gene Transfer & Sexual Selec-
tion Theory in Bacteria' Application Deadline: Thurs-
day March 21, midnight UK time https://bit.ly/2ST4j4s
Sexual selection is a powerful evolutionary force in many
higher organisms, and arises from dierences in mat-
ing or fertilization success associated with male-male
competition and female mate choice. In contrast to the
vast amount of research done on sexual selection in in-
sects, birds and mammals, little work has been done on
sexual selection on other organisms. Because bacteria
frequently engage in sex (through horizontal gene trans-
fer) with substantial tness consequences, it raises the
question whether there is scope for mate choice of mo-
bile DNA elements or competition over DNA insertion
in bacteria. And if so, what consequences will sexual
selection have on bacterial adaptation?
To understand these questions, the current PhD project
aims to develop evolutionary models of mate choice and
mating competition in bacteria (using analytical models
and/or computer simulations) in collaboration with Dr
Bram Kuijper and Prof David Hosken. Dependent on
the students own interests, she/he is also welcome to
engage in empirical research on bacteria. Moreover, the
theoretical work will be informed by empirical analyses
on experimental evolution of sexual selection in bacteria,
carried out by a postdoctoral researcher working with
Dr Edze Westra and Prof Angus Buckling.
Funding and location: The PhD studentship is fully-
funded by the Leverhulme Trust and will commence in
May 2019 or as soon as possible thereafter. For eligi-
ble students the studentship will cover UK/EU tuitionfees plus an annual tax-free stipend of at least £14,777
for 3.5 years full-time, or pro rata for part-time study.
The student would be based in Centre for Ecology and
Conservation in the College of Life and Environmental
Sciences at the Penryn Campus in Cornwall, one of
the hotbeds of research in ecology and evolution in the
United Kingdom.
Entry requirements: Applicants for this studentship
must have obtained, or be about to obtain, a First
or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree, or the
equivalent qualications gained outside the UK, in an
appropriate area of science or technology. Applicants
with Masters degree are also encouraged to apply. An
interest in learning quantitative skills (e.g., program-
ming, statistical analyses, mathematics) would be highly
desirable.
Application deadline: The closing date for applications
is midnight on March 21 2019. Interviews will be held
on the University of Exeters Penryn Campus the week
commencing April 22 2019.

UGreifswald Biomathematics
Job announcement: PhD position available
There is a biomathematics PhD position available in my
group as of the 1st of July 2019.
This position is part of a larger project aiming at digi-
talizing ecological data, but the subproject concerning
this PhD position is about graph theory and graph
symmetry/balance. Ideally, graph balance measures
can be used to interpret root data of plants (which
graph theoretically can be modelled by rooted trees or
sometimes by networks; and the other subprojects will
digitalize suitable underground photographs of roots),
but the development of new balance indices is a purely
mathematical problem. Thus, this project oers ideal
perspectives for a mathematically oriented PhD student
to develop new mathematical models for ecology.
For the position, mathematical pre-knowledge, partic-
ularly in the area of graph theory, is essential. It is
benecial if the candidate is also uent in at least one
programming language. Ecological and biological pre-
knowledge is also benecial, but not mandatory. How-
ever, willingness to cooperate interdisciplinarily is essen-
tial. Knowledge of the German language is not essential
in this project.The application deadline is the 14th of April 2019. Ap-
plications should be sent as one single PDF le to

Movement patterns and environmental preferences of
migratory and resident Atlantic cod juveniles
The University of Iceland (hi.is) seeks bright, hard-
working individuals for two graduate positions asso-
ciated with the research project \Movement patterns
and environmental preferences of migratory and resi-
dent Atlantic cod juveniles ", funded by the Icelandic
Center for Research (RANNIS). The research project
involves collaboration between Dr Gu ~A^Aobj~A^A~A sta
~A'lafsdottir at the University of Iceland, the Research
Centre of the Westfjords, Prof. Steven Campana and
Prof. Sn ~A^Abj~A^AP~A^Alsson at the University of Iceland,
Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Prof. Einar
Eg Nielsen at the Danish Technical University and Prof.52 EvolDir April 1, 2019
Stef~A^An~A'li Steingrimsson at Holar University College.
The aim of the project is to test if juvenile Atlantic
cod of dierent migratory genotypes dier in behavior,
environmental preferences, habitat use and distribution.
We will ask if juveniles of the migratory cod genotype
share some of the same traits as adult cod of the same
type, that is, forage more broadly, move more quickly,
show bolder behavior and have preferences for cooler,
high salinity waters. We then ask if juvenile behavior,
environmental and habitat preferences diverge across
ontogeny, that is, whether the migratory genotypes be-
come more similar to their adult counterparts, and less
similar to juveniles with resident genotypes, as they age.
Finally, we intend to test if the correlation of migratory
genotypes and migratory phenotypes is plastic.
The work will involve eld work, behavioral and environ-
mental preference tests in a laboratory setting, acoustic
telemetry in natural habitats and SNP genotyping. The
positions oered are for one PhD candidate and one
MSc candidates. A second PhD candidate has been
hired. The students should start no later than August
2019.
The PhD candidate will be enrolled at the Faculty of
Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Ice-
land, but based at the University of Iceland's Research
Centre of the Westfjords. Applicants should have an
MSc degree in biology, aquatic ecology, or similar, have
a strong academic background, the ability to indepen-
dently solve technical problems in the laboratory and
eld and be able to work independently in demanding
situations. Prior experience in sh ecology is preferred
and prior experience in aquatic telemetry and/or sh
husbandry is an advantage. The PhD candidate will be
funded for 3 years with the possibility of an extension.
The MSc candidate will be enrolled at the Faculty of Life
and Environmental Sciences at the University of Iceland,
but based at the University of Iceland's Research Centre
of the Westfjords and the Danish Technical University.
Applicants should hold a BSc degree in biology or a
related disciplinary, have a strong academic record, be
capable of working under demanding conditions in the
eld and SNP genotyping in the laboratory. The MSc
candidate will receive partial funding for 24 months.
Applicants should contact Dr Gu ~A^Aobj~A^A~A sta
~A'lafsd ~A^A3ttir for inquiries (gaol@hi.is). Applications
should include a recent CV, a short statement of re-
search interest, names and contact information for two
references, and academic transcripts. The application
deadline is 1 May 2019 or until appropriate candidates
have been recruited.

UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO NSF-EPSCoR GEM3
We seek highly motivated students for 3 Ph.D. positions
at the University of Idaho in the recently funded NSF-
EPSCoR GEM3 program (https://www.idahogem3.org).
The program seeks to understand how genetic diversity
and phenotypic plasticity aect species response to en-
vironmental change, shaping both population response
and adaptive capacity. The program is focused primar-
ily on two taxa: redband trout, a subspecies of rainbow
trout, and sagebrush. These taxa are integral to aquatic
and terrestrial ecosystems across the American West
and are central to land-use management decisions that
drive the economy of the region. Two of the PhD posi-
tions will focus on these taxa, and the third will focus on
landscape genomics and adaptive interactions of terres-
trial wildlife species reliant on sagebrush systems such
as southern Idaho ground squirrels, pygmy rabbits and
sage grouse.
These Ph.D. students will join an interdisciplinary co-
hort of postdoctoral researchers and students working
at scales from genomic characterization of physiological
traits in trout and sagebrush, to mapping and modeling
of complex ecological, evolutionary, and social-economic
systems. Students will have the opportunity to gain
skills such as molecular population genomics, landscape
genetics analysis, and agent-based and systems model-
ing.
The possible start dates for these positions are August
2019 or January 2020. Students will be co-advised by
Lisette Waits (Fish & Wildlife Sciences) and Paul Ho-
henlohe (Biological Sciences). Students in the GEM3
program may choose from several degree programs at
UI, including Natural Resources, Bioinformatics andApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 53

UmeaU LandscapeGenomics
Project description This project integrates genomic
methods and ecological modeling to assess the eect
of landscapes on evolutionary processes. We use recent
conceptual and methodological advances in genetics and
spatial ecology to study patterns in gene ow and how
this is inuenced by landscape structure and obstruc-
tion of dispersal pathways by land-use activities. The
project will use genetic markers to infer how dispersal
of riverine plants has been aected by dams in regu-
lated rivers. We will also evaluate the distribution of
genetic diversity along the river course in selected plant54 EvolDir April 1, 2019
species. We test (1) whether dams are barriers to plant
dispersal, resulting in isolated populations with higher
genetic dierentiation between sites separated by dams
than between populations in the same impoundment
or among sites in free-owing rivers, and (2) whether
the downstream increase in genetic diversity of riverine
plants documented in many species is absent or less
pronounced in rivers fragmented by dams. The results
of the project will help manage regulated rivers with
the aim to conserve riverine plant communities.
Qualications We seek a candidate with relevant aca-
demic background (genetics, ecology, or equivalent sub-
ject) with interest in using genetic methods to under-
stand landscape ecological processes. Experience with
genetic analyses and laboratory work using genetic meth-
ods are required.
Experience of population genetic analyses, high through-
put genotyping methods and knowledge of bioinformat-
ics are meriting. The candidate should be creative, show
initiative, independence and good social skills, and have
a very good command in both oral and written English.
Evaluation will be based on the individual letter, quality
and relevance of master thesis and other publications,
the interview, and the candidate's performance in a
literature essay given after the interview.
The recruitment procedure for the position is in accor-
dance with the Higher Education Ordinance. Prerequi-
sites for PhD studies include a degree on Master level, or
240 ECTS credits of higher education studies of which
60 should be on an advanced level (Master level), or
an equivalent qualication. This position specically
requires 120 ECTS credits in a subject relevant for
ecology.
Terms for the employment The employment is expected
to result in a doctoral degree and the main assignment
for the doctoral student is thus to be part of the research
education, which includes participation in the described
research project but also to take relevant courses. Teach-
ing and other departmental work (up to a maximum
of 20%) can be included. The employment is limited

the discontinuity of water paths. Recently, it has been
found that bacteria can disperse in the liquid layer on
the surface of fungal hyphae. Fungal hyphae networks
are like a 3D highway system that connects vast areas
in the soil, providing potentially a very ecient way
for bacteria to disperse. However, unlike the highways
we are familiar with, fungal highways are generated by
living organisms and likely the fungus providing a dis-
persal path interacts with bacteria in complex ways. In
this PhD project we will nd out how bacteria spread
through fungal hyphae networks, and whether the inter-
actions between fungi and bacteria promote or impedeApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 55
the dispersal. In addition, we will study how nutrients
inuence the interactions between fungi and bacteria.
Our pilot experiments have already shown that the
nature of interactions between fungi and bacteria can
change in function of nutrient availability. Understand-
ing the eects of nutrients can help nding ways to
manipulate fungi-bacteria interactions and their eect
on soil functioning.
The successful applicant should have a strong back-
ground in microbiology lab work and data analysis, and

A PhD position in Evolutionary Biology will be avail-
able ad the Department of Biology of the University of
Padova, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Leonardo
Congiu.
The project is part of a larger project conducted by 4
Italian Universities with a big eort of massive sequenc-
ing (University of Florence), bioinformatics (University
of Trieste) population genomics analyses (University of
Ferrara), and in vivo (University of Padua) experiments,
aimed at applying a Genomic approach to the conserva-
tion of ve Italian endemic species (a mammal, a reptile,
an amphibian, a sh, and an insect).
The doctoral project will specically focus on one of
the above species, the Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser nac-
carii), a critically endangered sturgeon Endemic to Italy,
and will include both eld and laboratory activities.
The PhD project has the following goals: a) assess the
degree of accumulation of potentially deleterious muta-
tions in the small residual population of the Adriatic
sturgeon; b) evaluate the eect of inbreeding on the
tness of 6 inbred and 6 outbred groups of ngerlings,
generated by controlled reproduction, by estimating be-
havioural and physiological variables; c) identify a panel
of~4,000 SNPs with alleles predicted to be deleterious
will be typed in larvae from each cross to infer the pat-
tern of load segregation and the association with the
tness estimates and the crosses (inbred vs. outbred).
d) evaluate the eects of dierent rearing conditions on
the expected survival of released individuals.
The selected candidate is expected be fully involved
in the organization, conduction and data analyses of
the in vivo experiments that will last the entire rst
year of activity, supported by post-doctoral fellows and
by undergraduate students. In the following years the

UPotsdam EvolutionaryRescue
PhD student position at the University of Potsdam:
Evolutionary Rescue in Complex Communities
A PhD student position is available in the Ecology and
Ecosystem Modelling group headed by Prof. Ursula
Gaedke at the University of Potsdam. This project will
be under the supervision of Dr. Ellen van Velzen, in
collaboration with Dr. Christian Guill.
Project description: Environmental change may drive
species extinct; but evolutionary rescue (ER) of a species
may occur if it can adapt rapidly enough to the new
conditions. ER has been extensively studied in single-
species contexts; however, very little is known on ER
when species are embedded in a larger community such
as a food web, and is interacting with prey, predators
and competitors. In this project we will develop new
theory on ER in such complex communities, compris-
ing the incidence of, mechanisms for, and eects of ER
in food webs ranging in size from small (4 species) to
large (20-50 species). This new theory will be based on
well-established theory of eco-evolutionary feedbacks,
where rapid trait changes aect ecological dynamics in
real time, and vice versa. The focus will here be onApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 57
traits mediating predator-prey interactions: defensive
traits in prey and oensive traits in predators. Such
traits directly aect community dynamics, and therefore
provide a rich potential for aiding ER that has gone
essentially unexplored by existing theory.
The location: The Ecology and Ecosystem Modelling
Group is an established centre for both theoretical and
experimental study on eco-evolutionary dynamics. It
is located in the middle of beautiful Park Sanssouci
in Potsdam, a Cultural World Heritage site centrally
located in Potsdam, and about 30 minutes away from
Berlin. Further information on current group research
can be found at https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ibb-
ecology/ To apply: For this project we are looking for
candidates with a MSc degree in ecology, evolutionary
biology, or physics. Applicants should have a strong
theoretical background, not be scared by mathematical
modelling, and have some experience with models using
dierential equations. Experience with modelling popu-
lation dynamics is particularly welcome. Knowledge of
German is not required.
Interested applicants should send one PDF containing
the following: - CV - letter of motivation - contact
details of 2 references to Ellen van Velzen (velzen@uni-
potsdam.de). Applications will be reviewed starting
March 18, and reviewing will continue until the position
is lled.

UppsalaU ComputationalGenetics
PhD Student position in Computational Genetics, Upp-
sala University
The Carlborg research group at the Department of Med-
ical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University,
are looking for PhD student candidates for admission
during the fall semester of 2019.
The research group focus on studying the geneticsof complex traits with a particular emphasis on
non-additive genetic inheritance in polygenic genetic
architectures. An interdisciplinary, interspecies ap-
proach is used, where new genetic models, statistical
methods, and bioinformatics approaches are devel-
oped to explore experimental data from a range of
species ' from yeast to plants and domestic animals.
Powerful experimental datasets are obtained from
a variety of sources, including public repositories,
collaborators or own experimental work. Researchers
and PhD-students in the group are all involved in
both methods development and experimental data
analyses. You can nd more information about the
research group at https://www.imbim.uu.se/research-
groups/genetics-and-genomics/carlborg{rjan/ . In the
fall semester of 2019, we will be able to oer up to two
candidates funding for performing their PhD studies
with us. This funding is in the form of a full time
four-year employment at Uppsala University. The
position comes with salary and full benets of being
a Swedish University employee. During the studies,
the PhD candidate will have full access to state of art
computing resources and training programs provided by
SciLife & Uppsala University. Limited travel funding
for attending conference and summer schools are
available within the program. Up to 20% teaching
can be requested annually, in which case the position
will be prolonged to ve years. The PhD program
includes a total of 30 credits (20 weeks) of courses, a few
obligatory and most optional, the rest of the program is
own research. More information on the PhD program
can be found at http://www.imbim.uu.se/Education/-
Postgraduate+education/information-and-documents/
.The starting date is exible, but the initial plan is for
admission during the fall semester of 2019. Review of
applications will start immediately and will continue
until suitable candidates have been found.
The rst half (2 years) of the PhD projects will include
work with the Virginia lines ' a chicken population
developed during a long-term (60 year) bi-directional,
single-trait selection experiment. This is an excellent
model to study the genetic basis of long-term selection
response on an adaptive trait that is highly polygenic.
Earlier work has shown that selection has acted on a
complex genetic architecture including loci with either
tightly linked adaptive variants, multiple segregating
haplotypes and/or interactions between loci. By work-
ing with this experimental data, the PhD students will
get training and hands-on experience with standard se-
quencing bioinformatics methods and tools, as well as
state of the art statistical, population and quantitative
genetics analyses. A valuable resource to the project
is a dataset including approximately 4000 phenotyped,58 EvolDir April 1, 2019
pedigreed and individually low-coverage sequenced indi-
viduals from a 19 generation deep advanced intercross
line between the divergently selected lines. The later
half (2 years) of the project will be decided depending
on the interest and competence of the admitted PhD stu-
dent, and could therefore involve, for example, detailed
explorations of specic genetic mechanisms via analyses
of data from other species or data simulations, or more
focus on development of new models and methods for
trait mapping or modeling of genotype-to-phenotype
mappings.
Qualications
MSc in Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computational biol-
ogy, Quantitative/Population/Evolutionary genetics or
similar qualications is a requirement. If the degree is
not already completed, it should be indicated when it
is estimated to be obtained.
Given the analytical content of the project, it is a merit
to have good knowledge and experience of both genetics
and informatics. This can be shown through earlier
research experience in the eld. Programming is an
important tool in the project and therefore you should
have experience in programming in e.g. R, C++, For-
tran, Perl, Python or Java. You should have excellent
English abilities, both orally and in writing. If you are a
mathematician/statistician/computer scientist, comple-
mentary knowledge in genetics or genomics is meriting.
Knowledge in mathematics/statistics/computer science
is in the same way meriting if your exam is in biology.

Project title
\New Guinea, a hotspot for human evolution: settlement
history and adaptation in northern Sahul"
Background/Knowledge gap: Papuans are the oldest
continuous human population found outside Africa. Re-
cent advances in human genetics have highlighted the
unique genomic characteristics of these populations. Iso-
lated from the rest of the world for most of the last
50ky, they have undergone an independent genetic and
cultural evolution and diversicatio n that is largely
unexplored. Today Papuans harbor the highest propor-
tion of genetic introgression (5%) and genomic traces (
<2%) from an archaic human, Denisova , vestiges of a
possible early extinct expansion of modern humans out
of Africa. Since their arrival into t he Sahul (ancient
landmass composed of Australia and New Guinea), they
have been shaped by a wide variety of environments
(coast, swamp, high altitude), strong geographical bar-
riers (high mountains, isolated valleys), exceptional cul-
tural diversity (900 languages), and the independent
development of agriculture in the highland (9000BCE).
The biological patrimony of these human groups is in-
herited from a complex history involving: (1) the initial
settlers (50kya), (2) admixture with extinct hominins;
and (3) with the mid-Holocene Asians. Distinguish
ing and isolating these three layers will help to answerApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 59
some of the highly debated questions in human genetic
history.
Aim/innovation: The PhD students will analyse new
Papuan genomes, combining existing and recently
developed software, and develop new research ap-
proaches/tools to: (1) better characterize the genetic an-
cestries inherited from extinct hominins; (2) reconstruct
demographic processes during the last 50ky (population
genetic model); and (3) identify specic selection signals
from local adaptation or adaptive introgression (Asian
or Denisova) related to environmental pressure s (high
altitude, pathogen, diet). These results are crucial to
understand out-of-Africa models and human adaptation
to environmental pressures. We combine the reliability
of previously developed analytical tools and the cost-
eective usage of already generated and unpublished
whole genome sequences associated to phenotypic and
environmental data. Innovations rely on the largest
dataset of high quality genomes analyzed for this under-
explored region and the integration of several layers of
biological diversity (genome and phenotype).
Collaborative research
The position will be part of a collaborative research
network involving Prof Murray P Cox (Univ. of Massey,
New Zealand), Dr Matthew Leavesley (Univ. of Papua
New Guinea, PNG), Irene Gallego-Romero (Univ. of
Melbourne, Australia), Dr Lounes Chikhi (Instituto
Gulbenkian de Ci^ encia, Portugal), Dr Nicolas Brucato
(Univ. of Toulouse, France), Dr Robert Attenborough

Duties and responsibilities
The PhD student will carry out his research activity
in the eld of modern human population genomics, in-
cluding but not limited to the generation of DNA data
from samples to the genomic library stage, the anal-
ysis of whole genome data and writing publications.
He/she will have the opportunity to undertake eldwork

***MSc position - University of Wyoming - salmonid
evolution in alpine lakes***
An MSc position is available to work on a funded
collaborative, interdisciplinary project examining sh
evolutionary responses to introduction in alpine lakes
of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. The position
is jointly in the labs of Catherine Wagner (cewagn-
erlab.com) and Amy Krist (http://www.uwyo.edu/-
krist/), with additional collaboration with Annika Wal-
ters (http://wyocoopunit.org/labs/walters-lab/people)
and Bryan Shuman (https://sites.google.com/site/-
shumanlab/Home).
This MSc project is a component of a larger project
examining ecological and evolutionary responses to sh
introduction in alpine lakes of the Wind River Range, a
stunning and little-studied mountain range in western
Wyoming. The project is studying three key components
of change associated with sh introduction into alpine
lakes: 1) the response of contemporary zooplankton
communities to sh; 2) lake ecosystem change associ-
ated with sh introduction through the study of lake
sediment cores, and 3) sh evolution in response to their
introduction into these lakes by humans ~50-100 years
ago. The MSc project advertised here will focus on this
third component, and will involve collection an analysis
of sh and zooplankton communities, measurement and
analysis of sh phenotypes, and genetic work. The MSc
student will work integratively with other MSc students
focused on analysis of zooplankton communities and
analysis of ecosystem change in sediment cores.April 1, 2019 EvolDir 61
Candidates should have a strong background and inter-
est in ecology and evolution, and motivation for highly
collaborative team-based eldwork in the high alpine for
several weeks each summer. Previous experience work-
ing with sh would be useful but is not required. Study
sites are dicult to access and require extended back-
country travel; eld teams make use of stock animals
during extended trips to carry supplies and samples.
The starting date for this position is summer 2019 with
the goal of obtaining samples during this eld season
prior to starting as an MSc student in fall semester 2019.
Please send a letter of interest, CV, and contact infor-
mation for three references to Dr. Catherine Wagner:

Start Date & Duration: May 2019; 1 year with likely
extension
Project Description/Summary: Aquatic Invasive Species
(AIS) such as rainbow trout, bass, and zebra mussels are
spreading across North America causing massive eco-
nomic and ecological problems. To help prevent spread,
new environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling and labora-
tory qPCR tests are now available for early detection
and monitoring AIS. This lab position will involve opti-
mizing real time qPCR assays applying them to track
spread of AIS. Much of the work will involve testing wa-
ter samples from Montana, Idaho, and adjacent states.
The successful applicant could help collect water eDNA
samples in national parks and wilderness areas across
Montana. Sampling would include use of a mobile qPCR
on lakes (from a speed boat), and the use of autonomous
sampling instruments that collect multiple samples daily
(automatically, with no human on site) from streams.
We are especially concerned about stopping the spread
of zebra mussels which were discovered in Montana in
2016 (Fig. 1). The successful applicant will also test for
invasive rainbow trout, brook trout, and bass (Fig. 2).
Skills required: The applicant should have experience
applying qPCR assays (e.g. TaqMan) to eDNA sam-
ples or dicult/ancient DNA samples. The successfulApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 67
applicant would ideally also have a Master's degree or
equivalent experience in writing reports or publications,
working as a team, and collaborating successfully with
natural resource agency eld biologists. The applicant
will participate in planning and publishing model pro-
jections of AIS spread. Experience with metabarcoding
and next generation sequence data analysis would be
helpful.
Applications: Send a brief letter ( <1 page) describing
your motivation and background, your CV, and the
names and contact information for three references. Re-
view of applications will start immediately (February)
and remain open until a suitable candidate is hired.

Project Description/Summary: Aquatic Invasive Species
(AIS) such as rainbow trout, brook trout, and zebra
mussels are spreading across North America causing
massive economic and ecological problems (Figs. 1,
2). To help prevent spread, new environmental DNA
(eDNA) sampling and laboratory qPCR tests are now
available for early detection and monitoring of these
AIS. This lab position will involve applying real time
qPCR assays to track spread of AIS in Montana and ad-
jacent states. The successful applicant could help collect
water eDNA samples in national parks and wilderness
areas across Montana. Sampling would include use ofa mobile qPCR on lakes (from a speed boat), and the
use of autonomous sampling instruments that collect
multiple samples daily (automatically, with no human
on site) from streams. The successful applicant will
help publish novel approaches to understand, predict,
and prevent evolutionary adaptation and spread of AIS
(Fig. 2). Skills required: The applicant should have
experience applying qPCR assays (e.g. TaqMan) to
eDNA samples or dicult/ancient DNA samples. The
successful applicant would ideally also have a Master's
degree or equivalent experience in writing reports or
publications, working as a team, and collaborating suc-

MolecularEcolPrize Nominations
Second Call for Nominations for Molecular Ecology Prize
We are soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular
Ecology Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scientic
society, so there is no body that actively promotes the
discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial board
of the journal Molecular Ecology therefore created the
Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void, and
recognize signicant contributions to this area of re-
search. The prize selection committee is independent of
the journal and its editorial board.April 1, 2019 EvolDir 81
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to Molecular Ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previous
winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf , Louis Bernatchez,
Nancy Moran, and Robin Waples.
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words; longer submis-
sions will not be accepted) directly to Robin Waples
(robinw3@uw.edu) by Tuesday, April 2, 2019. Organized
campaigns to submit multiple nominations for the same
person are not necessary and can be counterproductive.
Also, note that nominations from previous years do not
roll over.

Software PGT update
Dear All,
I have just uploaded a new version of PGT software for
generating geophylogenies (phylogenetic tree mapped
onto a high resolution map). PGT is extremely easy to
use. It takes only eight mouse-clicks from installation
to generating a high-resolution geophylogeny.
The main updates are:
1) Added geophylogeny that \stands on" maps with ver-
tical lines scaled to branch lengths. Here is the link to
the new geophylogeny: http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/-
PGT/PGT BranchLen.PNG 2) The slow google satel-
lite map is replaced by google terrain map (which is fast
and also more relevant to biogeographic studies)
3) The PGT paper has been accepted by Global Ecology
& Biogeography, so now you can cite:

Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and
Technology (IST) Austria is recruiting volunteers to as-
sist with eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees
(Spain) this coming summer (June-July).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary dynamics
underlying population divergence in wild Antirrhinum
majus (snapdragons). We focus on natural hybrid zones
between two subspecies with dierent ower colours.
Most of the eld work is contributing to a long-term
pedigree project aimed at establishing a direct link from
genotype to phenotype to tness. With tens of thou-
sands of samples collected over ten years so far, this
provides an exciting and powerful system to examine
many outstanding questions about adaptation and quan-
titative genetics in wild populations. We are seeking
volunteers to assist with the eld work, which involves
working in teams mapping the location of individual
plants (GPS), tagging and sampling them for leaves
and owers, measuring quantitative traits, phenotyping
them for ower pigmentation and processing material
for later DNA extraction. There may also be opportu-
nities to be involved in other projects we are doing on
plant-insect interactions. Most of the work is outdoors,
however we do spend some time indoors processing sam-
ples. The work is highly team orientated, typically in
groups of 2-3 in the eld and larger groups processing
samples back at the research station. This is a great
opportunity for anybody looking to obtain experience in
eld work relating to evolutionary biology, plant ecology
and plant-insect interactions.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees in Catalonia in northeastern Spain.
We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a pic-
turesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(within Europe) are covered. However, we cannot oerany further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students/graduates with a strong
interest in working outdoors with plants. You must be
meticulous with recording data and also be comfortable
working as part of a team. Experience with eld-based
projects and plants is preferred but not essential.
We require assistance between June 1 and July 31. De-
pending on the year and the plants, we may extend
our time into August. Length of stay is exible but a
minimum stay of 3 weeks is required.
Please send any questions and your application to ca-
rina.baskett@ist.ac.at. To apply, send your CV or re-
sume, with a few sentences about your background and
why you are interested. Please include the length of
time you would be available. Please get in touch by

UCRiverside NSF REU Livebearing
Fish Placenta Evolution
National Science Foundation Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (NSF REU) Position in Livebearing
Fish Evolution & Reproductive Behavior Research
Overview: A 10-week NSF REU position is available
in David Reznick's lab at the University of Califor-
nia, Riverside for June-August 2019 (June 17 preferred
start date). The REU Student will participate in re-
search on the evolution of placentation in livebearing
shes (poeciliids). Poeciliids have the unique attribute
of having evolved the functional equivalent of a mam-
malian placenta at least nine times. There are at least
three clusters of species that contain close relatives with
and without placentas. This raw material gives us the
opportunity to address questions about why and how
placentas evolved that cannot be addressed in mammals
because all placental mammals trace their common an-cestry to a single origin of the placenta that happened
100-200 million years ago. We are studying aspects of
reproductive behavior, development, and genomics with
experiments involving crosses between females from dif-
ferent populations of several placental and non-placental
species. These crosses are performed to assay female
and ospring tness based on the genetic distance be-
tween the female and male's populations. Furthermore,
we, in collaboration with another lab, use genetic tech-
niques to determine the paternity of ospring produced
in experimental crosses in which females are articially
inseminated with sperm from multiple males. The goal
is to determine if there is dierential success among
males siring ospring and dierential provisioning of
ospring during development.
Duties: The REU Student will be working with a PhD
student to choose a project and collect/analyze data.
Duties will include helping to maintain experimental
sh (e.g. feeding, water changes and tank cleaning) and
record data throughout the duration of the experiment.
Additional duties (i.e. genetics benchwork or specic
experimental methods) will depend on the applicant's
skills and interests.
Eligibility: All animal care and laboratory training will
be provided, and no experience is required. Applicants
should be highly motivated, responsible, and have a
strong desire to learn about and conduct evolutionary
biology research. It is essential that applicants be able
to work in a collaborative environment and be able to
perform occasionally repetitive, meticulous tasks. NSF
requires that applicants be US citizens or permanent
residents of the USA or its possessions. Furthermore,
students must be current undergraduate students en-
rolled through Fall 2019. We especially encourage stu-
dents from under-represented groups and institutions
with relatively limited research opportunities (e.g., com-
munity colleges and undergraduate-only institutions) to
apply.
Travel, Stipend, & Research Expenses: Travel to and
from Riverside, CA will be provided (up to $800) as
well as a stipend of $500/week ( $5000 total) for approx.
40 hours per week. Housing will not be provided.
Application Details: Send a cover letter and CV (see be-
low for contents) in an email with the subject \Reznick
REU Position" to Samantha Levell ( sleve004@ucr.edu)
by April 20th, 2019 at 5pm PST. All applications will
be reviewed after the deadline, and top applicants will
be contacted for Skype interviews shortly after. All
applicants will be notied by May 6th whether they
have received the position or not.

UExeter FieldAssist UKBees
Social Insect Fieldwork Assistants, UK:
We seek two eld assistants to work on a study of social
behaviour in ground-nesting sweat bees (Halictidae).
The start and end dates of the position are somewhat
exible but also will depend on when bees start nesting
in Spring. One position will start approximately 1 May
and the other from the middle of June, and they will
ideally end when the bees have nished nesting for the
year (mid August to early September).
The assistants will be working alongside a Postdoctoral
researcher and research technician in Gloucestershire,
UK. The study species is a small/medium-sized bee that
nests in small colonies (with fewer than 10 individuals)
in the ground and has an insignicant sting. Work
will involve: observing foraging behaviour, handling and
marking bees, setting up video cameras/uploading video
footage etc. In warm weather, eld assistants will work
all day in the eld; in bad weather there will be tasks
to carry out back at the accommodation but also oppor-
tunity for time o. Because the work involves recording
colour marks on individual bees, the job would not be
suitable for someone who is colour-blind. See our re-
search group website for more information about the
kind of work we do (https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/-
sta/index.php?web id=Jeremy Field).
Experience of working with insects and a
Degree (or working towards a Degree) in a
Behaviour/Evolution/Ecology-related topic aredesired. Flexibility around the start and end dates
of the assistant positions is required. The successful
applicants must be prepared to work hard and have
enthusiasm for eldwork. They will obtain excellent
experience of cutting-edge social insect research.
Shared accommodation is provided, but assistants are
required to pay for their own food/personal expenses.
Assistants receive an additional £125 per week to help
cover personal costs.
Please contact Dr Rebecca Boulton
(r.boulton@exeter.ac.uk) and CC Prof. Jeremy
Field (j.p.Field@exeter.ac.uk) to discuss these positions
further. Please attach a CV and briey outline your
motivation to carry out the work.

Vignettes on
EvolutionaryApplications
Dear EvolDir,
We are seeking your help in developing two-page vi-
gnettes on Applications of Evolution to topics that im-
pact our world in a variety of ways. The concept is
to identify primary research papers that have exciting
applications of evolution to areas of impact on envi-
ronment (climate change, conservation, biotic assembly,
etc.), medicine (infectious disease, genomics, human phe-
notypic variation, etc.), and Society (agriculture, law,
computation, language, etc.). Then develop a lay sum-
mary (2 page, 2 gure/table) of the research topic for use
in teaching eorts at high school, college, and political
levels. We envision graduate seminars and/or lab groups
focused on developing such vignettes and submitting
for peer review via EasyChair https://easychair.org/-
cfp/EvolApps2019. We are developing a distinguished
Program Committee to review vignettes and welcome
additions to the Program Committee as well. The top
50 vignettes will be published in a volume by Oxford
University Press with up to four articles winning a cash
prize. We hope faculty and graduate students will orga-
nize around the world and produce exciting vignettes
for submission by our May 31, 2019 deadline. You can
nd more information and some example vignettes here
https://www.evolutionapps.org/. Please let me know if
you have any questions or need any guidance as your
are developing your Evolutionary Applications!

in plant phylogenetics and macroevolution.
Read more and apply here: http://international.au.dk/-
about/prole/vacant-positions/job/postdoc-in-
computational-phylogenetics-and-macroevolution/
Deadline: 15 April 2019
Job description: This postdoc is part of PhyloSynth,an international collaboration aiming to make the plant
Tree of Life more comprehensive, useful, and up-to-date.
You will contribute to the development of a bioinformat-
ics pipeline that gathers all publicly available phyloge-
netically informative data for plants, builds phylogenetic
trees using state-of-the-art methods, and disseminates
them to a variety of audiences. You will have the op-
portunity to use the resulting trees in e.g. macroevo-
lutionary analyses of plant diversication. You will be
expected to develop well-documented software packages
and publish your work in high-impact scientic journals.
Although PhyloSynth is focusing on plants, we expect
most of the methods developed to be applicable to other
taxa and thus of broader interest and impact. For more
information on the aims of PhyloSynth, see: https:/-
/doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1041. The exact focus of yourApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 89
work within the overall scope of PhyloSynth is exible
de pending on your skills and interests.
Your prole: You have a PhD degree (or submitted
your PhD thesis for assessment before the application
deadline) in biology, bioinformatics, computer science
or similar. Computers are among your most important
research tools - the bigger the better. You would rather
write a well-documented script than risk having to do
something twice. You have written programs in more
than one language, but have your favourite. However,
you do not just want to develop code, you want to solve
scientic problems. Ideally, you have an interest in (and
experience with) tree thinking and phylogenetic analysis.
You enjoy working in a highly collaborative environment
including many other computer-minded biologists who
will discuss a biological hypothesis and a computational
challenge with equal enthusiasm.
International applicants who do not have English as

TITLE: Demographic history and population connectiv-
ity of hydrothermal vent species along the mid-Atlantic
Ridge using a ddRDAseq approach
ABSTRACT: Dispersal and colonization in hydrother-
mal vent species are essential to support local popula-
tions over short time scales, as well as in demographic
history of species and speciation over longer time scales.
This project is based on the development of genomic
scan approaches (RAD seq and possibly RNA seq) to es-
timate past and contemporary connectivity among Mid-
Atlantic Ridge vent species. The shrimps Rimicaris
spp., as well as the gastropod species Peltospira smarag-
dina and Lepetodrilus atlanticus are major species in
animal communities, especially at vent work sites that
have been visited repeatedly by our laboratory, includ-
ing those within a mining exploration license (AIFM)
and part of a deep-sea observatory (EMSO-Azores). We
propose to conduct a comparative approach on those
species with contrasting life-history traits in order to
1) describe the distribution of genetic diversity, to in-
fer past and contemporary connectivity patterns, and,
2) examine possible links between genetic connectivity
and species life cycle (reproduction and larval life), geo-
graphic barriers, or ecological gradients (depth, chemical
signature of vent uids). To this end, rst an exploratory
approach will be undertaken on dierent species and
one or two will be selected for a more thorough analysis.
This project falls within the scope of the Ifremer ABYSS
project on deep-sea genomics, and will contribute funda-
mental data to help dene possible strategies to ensure
sustainable human activities in this threatened ecosys-
tem.

Postdoctoral position in microbial interactions between
ants and social parasite beetles (Parker Lab)
Research focus: A postdoctoral position is available to
study the impact of endosymbiont microbes on animal-
animal symbiotic relationships in the lab of Joe Parker
at the California Institute of Technology.
Work in the Parker lab is focused on social and symbiotic
relationships between animals. We use a unique system
to explore these phenomena: the convergent evolution
of social parasitism of ant colonies by rove beetles (fam-
ily Staphylinidae). Rove beetles comprise the largest
metazoan family (64,000 species), and include multi-
ple lineages that have evolved to inltrate ant societies,
employing behavioral, anatomical and chemical adap-
tations. The Parker lab studies these adaptations at
the molecular and neurobiological levels. We are now
seeking a postdoctoral researcher to probe the endosym-
biotic microbiota of rove beetles and their host ants, to
address how communities of microbes and multicellular
organisms inuence each others evolution and function.
The successful candidate will spearhead community
metabarcoding and metagenomics of ants and social
parasite rove beetles to uncover microbial interactions
within and between these animal species. The focal
system is a model ant-beetle symbiosis that has evolved
in the South Western US, in which multiple rove beetle
lineages have convergently evolved to inltrate colonies
of a single ant genus. This project involves eldwork
at local sites near Caltech, as well as in Southern Ari-
zona. To better understand how microbes inuence
social and symbiotic interactions between these species,
experimental laboratory manipulations of beetle and
ant microbiomes will be pursued, together with pheno-
typic analysis of behavior and chemical ecology. Infer-
ences about how the evolution of animal interactions
impacts the microbiome will be pursued by compara-
tive studies of the microbiota of parasitic and related,
free-living beetles. There is substantial opportunity to
collaborate with other microbiology labs at both Cal-
tech and the University of Southern California, as well
as collaboration with theoretical biologists to develop
empirically-based models of multilevel, microbe-animal
networks.

Italy PDF PhD
ConservationGenomics
We are seeking expressions of interest for one Post Doc
and one PhD position at the University of Ferrara (Italy)
for a project investigating the population genomics pat-
terns in ve animal species endemic to Italy. The formal
selection process will be announced soon, but we ask to
all interested candidates to send their CV and contact
details of two references as soon as possible. We expect
the postdoc to start about September, while the phd
student will be enrolled in November.
This three year project has recently been funded by the
Italian Ministry for Education and Research. Using ve
iconic endangered Italian endemics as model species (a
mammal, a reptile, an amphibian, a sh, and an insect),
we plan to investigate the dynamics of the accumulation
of deleterious mutations in small populations, and their
impact on individual tness. We will estimate the ge-
nomic susceptibility to extinction due to mutation load,
predict the consequences of genetic rescue, and propose
conservation actions. We will also perform two func-
tional assays to corroborate the population genomics
analyses.
The project is a collaborative eort among four dierent
Italian Universities (Ferrara, Padova, Trieste, Firenze),
coordinated by Giorgio Bertorelle at the University of
Ferrara. The postdoc and phd positions oered in this
ad will be both based at the University of Ferrara, and
will mainly focus on the population genomics analyses.
The postdoc will additionally be responsible with the
PI for the coordination of the whole project. There will
be a regular interaction among students and researchers
from all units, sharing and discussing the advancements
in every topic relevant to the project. This will con-
tribute to the scientic growth of graduate students and
postdocs in many dierent elds: genomics, population
genetics, evolution, conservation biology, bioinformatics,
biotechnology.
The salary for the phd student is xed nationally and
will be 1140 Euros per month. The salary for the post-
doc is negotiable, but it will vary depending on the
previous experience between 1500 and 2200 Euros.

Project title: Competition under niche construction
(COMPCON) Funding: ERC Consolidator Grant, 2017-
2022.
Project abstract NB: the candidate is expected to work
on the parts of the project that deal with competitiveability).
Interspecic competition is arguably the best interac-
tion to address the how individual trait variation and
eco-evolutionary feedbacks shape species distributions
and trait evolution, due to its indirect eects on the
shared resource. However, a clear understanding of such
feedbacks is only possible if each contributing factor
can be manipulated independently. With COMPCON,
we will address the reciprocal interactions between in-
dividual variation, niche width, niche construction and
the presence of competitors using a system amenable
to manipulation of all these variables. The system is
composed of two spider mite species, Tetranychus ur-
ticae and T. ludeni, that up- and down-regulate plant
defences (i.e., negative and positive niche construction,
respectively). Mites will be colonizing tomato plants
with dierent cadmium concentrations, allowing quan-
titative variation of available niches. Tomato mutant
plants with low defences will be used as an environment
in which niche construction is not expressed. Individ-
ual variation in niche width and niche construction will
be measured in isogenic lines. Dierent combinations
of lines will then be used to test how such variation
in individual traits aects coexistence and evolution
with competitors. Data generated by COMPCON will
strengthen the growing link between Ecology and Evo-
lution, as it will test recent hypotheses concerning how
individual variation, niche width, niche construction
and competition interact to shape species distributions
and trait evolution.

#####
We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to be hired
at the University of Lyon (Biometry and Evolutionary
Biology Lab) for three years, starting in September 2019.
The project will deal with horizontal gene transfer in in-
sects and more specically with the hypothesis that host-
parasitoid interactions may constitute a major route
for this phenomenon. It builds on a long- term and
extensive ecological description of associations between
parasitoids and their lepidopteran hosts in a natural
area of Costa Rica. Through a collaboration with the
University of Pennsylvania and the University of Guelph,
we will sequence the full genomes of approximately 200
species from this system to assess if horizontal transfers
occur preferentially between insects that are tightly con-
nected through host-parasitoid interactions, or, in the
case of Lepidoptera, through the host plants they feed
on.
The project will require heavy involvement in bioinfor-
matics and evolutionary biology concepts and methods.
The ideal candidate will have a strong interest in hor-
izontal gene transfer, and in evolutionary biology at
both molecular and phenotypic levels. He or she should
be at ease with bioinformatics, modeling, phylogenetic
and co-phylogenetic analysis, and be inspired by the

ModelingAntibioticResistance
Postdoc position in Mathematical Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, Research Group Stochastic Evolutionary Dynamics,
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology
I am looking for a Postdoc to join my research group at
the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology.
Postdoc position (2 years): Evolutionary dynamics of
antibiotic resistance on plasmids
The evolution of antibiotic resistance poses a severe
threat to modern healthcare. Clinically relevant resis-
tance is often encoded on plasmids. Plasmids are extra-
chromosomal DNA elements that can be transmitted
vertically or be transferred horizontally between cells.
The location of resistance genes on plasmids can lead to
special evolutionary dynamics. The aim of the project
is to develop mathematical models for the evolution and
spread of resistance on plasmids. On the mathematical
side, the analysis will mainly be based on branching
process theory, complemented by deterministic ODE
systems and stochastic computer simulations.
The ideal candidate has experience in mathematical
modeling in biology and is keen on working on the evo-
lution of drug resistance. Knowledge of a programming
language (C, C++, Java, R, Python. . . ) is highly
desirable.
Working environment
The postdoc will join a young group at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology. In our group, we
focus on exploring the role of stochasticity in evolu-
tion. In the context of resistance evolution, we closely
collaborate with experimental microbiologists at the
University of Kiel. The group is part of the Department
of Evolutionary Theory. The postdoc will hence be part
of a larger community of researchers working at the
intersection of mathematics and biology with many op-
portunities to take part in journal clubs, reading groups
etc.
The Max Planck Institute is a lively institute with three
departments (Evolutionary Theory, Microbial Popula-
tion Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and several ad-
ditional research groups. It hosts several workshops
per year and continuously welcomes international short-
term and long-term visitors, creating a stimulating andApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 101
positive research environment. We maintain close in-
teractions with Kiel University and belong to the Kiel
Evolution Center. The area is a center of evolutionary
biology in Germany.

Pl on is a small town, embedded into a beautiful land-
scape with innumerous lakes and close to the Baltic
Sea. The area provides ample opportunity for free time
activities such as swimming, canoeing, or biking in a
stunning environment. At the same time, the cities of

EvolutionPlantResilience
*Postdoctoral Position: Evolution of Plant Resilience to
Abiotic and Biotic Stresses *
The Lowry lab in the Department of Plant Biology at
Michigan State University (MSU) is seeking a Postdoc-
toral Research Associate who will conduct population ge-
nomic and/or physiological research on Pathogen Resis-
tance and/or Cold Tolerance in switchgrass. Switchgrass
is an important target species for domestic production
of cellulosic biofuels. The principal aim of most switch-
grass breeding programs is to develop high-yielding cul-
tivars. However, as feedstock plantings expand, so will
pathogen pressure. Unless controlled, fungal pathogens
with explosive disease potential will likely drive yield de-
clines and economic losses. Pathogen resistance can be
developed through breeding programs that exploit nat-ural genetic variation in disease resistance. Much of the
functional genetic variation in switchgrass is distributed
clinally with latitude as well as between lowland and up-
land ecotypes. In general, southern lowland cultivars of
switchgrass have many advantages over northern upland
cultivars because they are higher yielding, require fewer
nitrogen inputs, and are more resistant to pathogens. In
addition, southern lowland cultivars are generally more
tolerant to heat, drought, and ooding than northern
upland cultivars. However, southern lowland cultivars
are more susceptible to winter kill than northern upland
cultivars.
The proposed research will utilize new and powerful ge-
netic mapping populations (QTL and GWAS) to identify
genomic regions responsible for divergence in disease re-
sistance and freezing tolerance between northern upland
and southern lowland switchgrass ecotypes. These map-
ping populations have been planted at an unprecedented
geographical scale, spanning twelve common garden eld
sites distributed from central Mexico to Michigan. We
are studying the genetic basis of resistance to pathogens
and overwintering ability across this latitudinal gradient.
In addition, we are conducting laboratory experiments
on fungal pathogen resistance as well as chilling and
freezing tolerance. Overall, these studies will provide
an improved understanding of the process local adapta-
tion and identify loci that can be utilized in switchgrass
breeding programs.
The successful candidate would work on the projects
they are most interested in pursuing related to cold
tolerance, pathogen resistance, and/or genomic analyses
in switchgrass.
*Required Qualications: *PhD in a eld related to Ge-

Postdoctoral opportunity: Evolution of Sensory Systems
& Evolutionary Genetics of Diversication
Posting snapshot: Looking for a highly motivated, cre-
ative scientist to join the Boughman research group to
study the evolution of sensory systems & evolutionary
genetics of diversication.
Position summary: Primary duties are to conduct
research emphasizing evolutionary diversication and
rapid adaptation in novel aquatic environments using
stickleback sh. The project investigates adaptation,
evolution of behavior and related morphological pheno-
types, and evolutionary genetics/genomics relating to
diversication. The postdoc will be responsible for car-
rying out research projects in the laboratory and eld,
training and supervising other personnel, analyzing data,
and publishing results in a timely fashion.
Like much of the Arctic, Iceland is experiencing unprece-
dented climate and ecological change, much of which
is caused by human activity. Against this backdrop of
ecological change many species may not adapt quickly
enough to survive. Understanding what facilitates and
constrains rapid adaptation is crucial in our era of global
anthropogenic change. We study adaptation of sight,
smell, and touch in extreme and novel sensory environ-
ments (glacial lakes). We focus on sensory adaptation
because animals gather information on the external en-
vironment using sight, smell, taste, sound, and touch to
nd prey, avoid predators, and mediate social interac-
tions; and because sensory systems are key for survival
and reproduction. This project is breaking new ground
investigating adaptation of sh to glacial lakes, some of
which have formed in less than 100 years as glaciers melt
due to climate change. Key objectives are to investigate
the pace and predictability of adaptation to changing
environments in the Arctic. Our project is motivated to
help understand and deal with large-scale environmental
issues our society faces.
Minimum qualications: Required experience includes:
generating and analyzing phenotypic and tness data on
morphology, behavior, and other adaptive phenotypes;
knowledge of quantitative and/or evolutionary genetics;
experience with microscopy, photo, and video analyses;
experience doing eld work in challenging locales; excel-lent analytical skills including experience analyzing big
datasets and working with databases; demonstrated abil-
ity to publish good quality papers; good communication
& writing skills.
Desired qualications: The Boughman lab studies the
evolutionary process of diversication, including spe-
ciation. We study the interplay between sexual and
natural selection in diversication; the creative and de-
structive role of hybridization; the evolution of behavior,
communication, cognition, and sensory systems; and
the consequences this trait evolution has for speciation.
We use the charismatic threespine stickleback system
because of its extraordinary power for addressing evolu-
tionary questions. Plus, the sh are fun to work with
and inherently intriguing. Ongoing research is with
populations in Iceland, with some work carried out in
British Columbia.
The position provides additional opportunities for inde-
pendent research in related areas for motivated postdoc-
toral scientists.
Ph.D. required in a related eld of biology. Salary and
benets are competitive.
Required application: Apply through the MSU Appli-
cantPage Position # 562336. To apply, please send

Two year postdoc at QMUL London: environmental
genomic analysis to enhance food security in Ethiopia
The southern Ethiopian highland agri-systems are highly
robust in times of famine V they include over 78 culti-
vated species encompassing roots, tubers, cereals, veg-
etables, fruits and pulses, with a very high proportion
of indigenous crops. Domestication appears to have in-104 EvolDir April 1, 2019
cluded adaptation to environments considerably outside
the environmental range of the wild ancestors.
The project is a survey of genomic diversity in key crops,
to understand this adaptation, in order to develop strate-
gies to sustain the agri-systems' resilience in the face of
climate change.
This postdoc will analyse the data generated by eld
researchers and geneticists / bioinformaticians at Kew.
It is possible, but not essential to accompany part of
the eld campaign in Ethiopia. Key skills are an un-
derstanding of genomic analysis and an appetite to
develop new analytical methods in collaboration with
Co-I Richard Nichols (https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/-

Start date: as soon as possible after the formal announce-
ment (any day now). Contact r.a.nichols@qmul.ac.uk

Switzerland Modeling Microbial
Interactions
Postdoc in modelling microbial interactions
I am looking to recruit a PostDoc researcher to study
microbial interactions, in particular, bacteria disper-
sal through fungal hyphae networks, and bacteria-fungi
interactions under dierent nutritional conditions, in
University of Neuch^ atel, Switzerland.
Bacterial dispersal is highly limited in soils because the
discontinuity of water paths. Recently, it has been found
that bacteria can disperse in the liquid layer on the sur-
face of fungal hyphae. Fungal hyphae networks are like
a 3D highway system that connects vast areas in the soil,
providing potentially a very ecient way for bacteria to
disperse. However, unlike the highways we are familiar
with, fungal highways are generated by living organisms,
and it is likely that the fungi providing a dispersal path
interact with bacteria in complex ways. We aim to nd
out how bacteria spread through fungal hyphae net-
works, and whether the interactions between fungi and
bacteria promote or impede the dispersal. In addition,
we will study how nutrients inuence the interactions
between fungi and bacteria. Our pilot experiments haveApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 105
already shown that the nature of interactions between
fungi and bacteria can change in function of nutrient
availability. Understanding the eects of nutrients can
help nding ways to manipulate fungi-bacteria interac-
tions and their eect on soil functioning.
The successful applicant should have a PhD in mathe-
matical modelling of biological dynamics by September
2019. Experience with modelling microbial interactions

focuses on the establishment of genomic resources in
medicinally important plants, and the deployment of
plant functional genomics as a gene discovery platform
supporting the reconstitution of specialized metabolic
pathways in microorganisms. The specic aims of this
position will be to build de novo genome assemblies

CBD and other cannabinoids), Catharanthus roseus
(vinblastine), Tabernanthe iboga (ibogaine), and Ephre-
dra sinica (ephedrine). High-quality genomes for these
plants will be complemented through the establishment
of de novo assemblies of related species, which we will
use for comparative genomic analysis. A particular area
of interest is an assessment of chromosomal clustering
of specialized metabolism biosynthetic genes, and an
analysis of how gene clustering might have evolved.110 EvolDir April 1, 2019
This project will generate substantial new data with
many potential avenues for analysis. A combination
of high-depth PacBio and Hi-C libraries will be used
to build large contigs, which will be scaolded to near
chromosome scale. The ideal postdoctoral candidate
will have direct experience using these types of data and
the bioinformatic processing tools necessary for build-

personalized analysis tools in R would also be highly
desirable. The project provides investigative exibility
and extra research funding is also available for well-

A two-year postdoctoral position is available to inves-
tigate the foraging ecology and genetics of two cleaner
sh species that forage on parasitic lice attached to
Atlantic salmon. The position would begin between
June-September 2019 and is funded for two years.
The project is led by Professor Elizabeth Boulding (In-
tegrative Biology, U. Guelph) with co-investigator Pro-
fessor Emeritus Larry Schaeer (Animal BioSciences,
U. Guelph). Our industrial collaborators are led by Dr.
K.P. Ang of Kelly Cove Salmon Ltd. (KCS) a division of
Cooke Aquaculture Inc. (CAI). They include Dr. J.A.K.
Elliott, Dr. M. Herlin, F. Powell from KCS, and Dr. T.
M. Jonassen from Akvaplan-Niva, Norway.
The objective of this NSERC Strategic Project is to pro-
vide a sustainable and pedigreed source of cleaner sh
to reduce lice densities found on Atlantic salmon living
in marine sea cages in Eastern Canada. This project
will develop highly-repeatable methods of measuring the
functional responses of two proven cleaner shes: the
lumpsh (Cyclopterus lumpus) and the cunner (Tauto-
golabrus adspersus). An outcome of this project will
be a breeding program for lice-eating performance by
lumpsh and by cunners at two existing hatcheries op-
erated by CAI. It will also deepen our understanding
of the reciprocal evolution of early mutualisms between
facultative cleaner shes and their clients.
The Postdoctoral fellow (with experience in sh applied
evolution/applied ethology/behavioural ecology) will
help the undergraduate and graduate students develop
repeatable methods of measuring posing and other co-
operative behaviors by client sh that facilitate parasite-
removal by cleaner shes. Their own project will involve
assisting with salmon lice challenges of pedigreed At-
lantic salmon and measuring client-posing rates near
cleaner sh refuges inside the tanks. It will also involve
analysis of video-assisted eld observations of client be-
havior near cleaner-sh refuges within marine sea cages.
The postdoc will be trained to estimate breeding val-
ues for lice-cleaning performance by the cleaner sh
and for posing performance by their Atlantic salmon
clients. Creating a breeding nucleus containing only112 EvolDir April 1, 2019
cleaner sh and client sh with high breeding values for
performance traits would be predicted to increase the
reciprocal co-evolution of this mutualism in marine sea
cages.
Please apply for the postdoctoral position by sending an
email to Dr. Boulding (boulding@uoguelph.ca) with at-
tachments containing: 1) your curriculum vitae/resume,
2) an electronic transcript of all your university grades, 3)
a list of referees with their email addresses and telephone

DRIVERS of INVASIVE SPECIES (March 2019)
Project: Modeling Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species
Combining Genetics & Environmental Data
Principal Investigators: Gordon Luikart, John Kimball,
Brian Hand, Flathead Lake Biological Station, Division
of Biological Sciences, The Univ. of Montana. gor-
don.luikart@umontana.edu, brian.hand@umontana.edu
(406.872.4500).
Start Date & Duration: April/May 2019; 1 year with a
possible 1.5-year extension.
Project Description/Summary: Aquatic Invasive Species
(AIS) including rainbow trout, brook trout, bass, and ze-
bra mussels are spreading across North America causing
massive economic and ecological problems. Fortunately,
large regional databases documenting spread of AIS
combined with novel eDNA detections can facilitate
early detection and prevention of spread. As part of a
NASA-funded project, the successful applicant will help
develop and apply predictive models (e.g. occupancy
models, GLMs) that combine genetic, environmental,
and time-series observational data on AIS spread to help
forecast future hotspots of invasion. The models will
help predict pathways of spread of AIS and to thereby
direct managers to monitor and manage spread. The ap-
plicant will help plan and develop online software tools
for managers and policy makers to visualize spread of
AIS within and among water ways across North America.
There will be opportunities for eld work and meetings
in Glacier National Park and waterways in the northern
Rocky Mountains.
The successful applicant will work with scientists and
managers from state and federal agencies (USGS, NPS,
NISC, Montana DNRC and FWP) to coordinate combin-
ing of AIS observational and eDNA data into databases.
The applicant will work with NASA and NISC (Na-
tional Invasive Species Council) to facilitate reporting
of data to address the United Nations on Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) number Goal 15 that seeks to\halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity
loss". The applicant will also help run AIS workshops
that will help build their communication network in
their career.
Skills required: The applicant should have experience
modeling the presence (occurrence) or movement of
individuals or genes (gene ow) using occupancy or in-
dividual based simulation models. Programming ability
in Python, R or similar language is required. Ideally
the applicant would have experience conducting statis-
tical (GLM) modeling to predict environmental drivers
(correlates) of AIS spread. The applicant should have
demonstrated ability to write and publish papers, use
and manage large databases, and communicate with
others from diverse groups (e.g. agencies, managers, re-
searchers). Experience applying satellite remote sensing
and other geospatial data for landscape habitat analysis
& modeling directed toward aquatic ecosystems would
be extremely helpful. Understanding eDNA metage-
nomics analyses would help.
Applications: Email us a brief letter describing your
motivation and background, your CV, and contact infor-
mation for three references. Review of applications will
start April 1st remain open until a suitable candidate
is hired.
Salary: Depends on experience and CV`.

of three planarian species with dierent modes of repro-
duction and varying regenerative potential to changes in
timing, intensity and frequency of resource availability.
This post is part of a dynamic and interdisciplinary
research group: the SalGo Team, led by A/Prof Rob
Salguero-Gomez. Some of the questions we study are
related to the evolution of senescence, constraints of
life history traits, and population responses to climate
change.
The work will involve (i) setting up an experiment to
test how the frequency, timing, and intensity to resource
availability shapes various life history traits on three
dierent species of atworms (Schmidtea mediterranea,
Dugesia tahitiensis and Polycellis tenuis), (ii) collection
of data under laboratory conditions of survival, develop-ment and reproduction of these species, (iii) construction
and analysis of integral projection models parameterised
with the laboratory data, and (iv) publication and dis-
semination of results in high impact factor journals,
conferences and the general public.
This post is ideally suited for applicants with a
PhD/DPhil (or be about to obtain) with a strong back-
ground in life history evolution, demography, population
ecology, and with experience in laboratory settings.
The closing date for applications is 12.00 noon on 5
April 2019.

The project
This position is created within a Discovery Projects
Grant funded by the Australian Research Council to
understand how genomes of dierently acquired dinoag-
ellate algae (Symbiodiniaceae) have evolved to support
symbiosis with corals. Coral reefs are sustained by
symbiosis between Symbiodiniaceae and the coral host,
and breakdown of this symbiosis under environmen-
tal stress results in coral bleaching and eventual death.
Through genome sequencing of symbiodiniacean isolates
from Australias Great Barrier Reef and their free-living
relatives using cutting-edge genomic technologies, the
Project aims to identify genes that have been gained,
lost or shared, or are under adaptive selection, along
the trajectory from free-living forms to symbionts. This

URochester EvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral fellow in evolutionary genomics Depart-
ment of Biology, University of Rochester
The Fay lab in the Biology Department at the University
of Rochester is seeking candidates for a postdoctoral fel-
low position. The lab works broadly on the genetic basis
of evolutionary change, utilizing both high-throughput
experimental approaches combined with statistical and
computational models. Our main experimental system
is yeast, focusing on the Saccharomyces species with
occasional forays into Candida and other species that
commonly show up in our eld collections. However, we
also have active collaborations working on domestication
in barley, preterm birth in humans, and testing theo-
ries of diversity using experimental evolution. These
interactions both stimulate project cross-fertilization
and create opportunities to develop novel approaches to
long-standing problems of interest to the lab.
Candidates will have the opportunity to expand on
current projects or explore new areas through the devel-
opment of a creative and independent project. Current
projects include the evolution of gene expression dy-
namics, the genetic basis of interspecic dierences in
thermotolerance, domestication and diversication of
S. cerevisiae, including wine, beer and other industrialstrains, and we are initiating plans to generate barcoded
mutant collections in both S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum
via CRISPR. We have extensive resources in population
genomics through our collection of over 4,000 wild yeast
strains, probabilistic models of cis-regulatory sequences,
as well as our recent acquisition of high-throughput
robotics paired with both natural and constructed collec-
tions of strain, plasmid and synthetic reporter libraries.
Candidates should have a clear vision of their research
interests along with expectations for training and men-
torship. While there are no strict requirements for
the position, strong quantitative skills, programming
experience, and a population or evolutionary genetics
background are desirable.
The Fay lab is located in the Biology Department, which
has a strong research group in evolutionary genetics and
genomics that has recently grown, providing a stimu-
lating and interactive environment. The Department
is located in Hutchinson Hall, adjacent to the Goer-
gen Institute for Data Science, Computer Science and
Biomedical Engineering Departments. Genomics and
proteomics cores are available across the street at the
Medical center and the Center for Integrated Research
and Computing provide state of the art facilities for
both parallel and large memory computing jobs.
Applicants for the position should send a curriculum
vitae, a statement of research interests and contact in-
formation for three references via email. Applications
will be reviewed starting in March and will continue
until the position is lled.

This research focuses on coevolution of chemical sense
and color vision in primates. Primates had long been
considered as vision-oriented mammals. But recent re-
searches have challenged this view. Our research team
has played a key role in the movement. Importance of
trichromatic color vision could be dependent and con-
ditional on dietary demands and ecological settings in
living environments. Various senses are likely to have
evolved inter-dependently. Chemical senses, such as
olfaction and tastes, in primates are now gathering re-
searchers' attention for their importance which has long
been overlooked. However, these genes belong to huge
multi-gene families and their repertoire has remained
less explored. Studies of them have largely relied on
whole-genome sequencing databases publicly available,
thus suering from varying degrees of perfection and
limited number of studied species.
We aim to cover diverse primate taxa from strepsirrhines,
tarsiers, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes
and humans for the study of inter-species divergence and
intra-species diversity of olfactory receptor (OR), taste
receptor (TASR) and visual receptor (opsin) genes by

EvolutionaryGenomics
The research group of John Pool at the University of

toral research position. We have multiple opportunities
for projects to work on, with an overarching theme of
addressing big questions in population/evolutionary ge-
netics. The candidate's own research interests can play
an important role in developing a research program of
shared interest.
Potential research areas could include:
* Measuring Genetic Diversity to Predict Adaptive Po-
tential Both within-population genetic variation and
between-population adaptive dierentiation may pro-
vide raw material for future evolution, but it's unclear
which is more important. It's also unclear how we should
summarize within- and between-population diversity if
our goal is to predict adaptive potential. Experimental
and methodological progress on these issues will inform
basic science and conservation.
* Fundamental Population Genetics We are interested
in leveraging data (such the >1000 genomes from our
Drosophila Genome Nexus), along with simulation and
statistical/computational methods to ask basic popu-
lation genetic questions. Examples could include new
angles on the classic but unresolved controversy over
the relative roles of selective sweeps and background
selection, and the relative roles of hard and soft sweeps
on autosomes versus the X chromosome.
* The Genetic Architecture of Reproductive Isola-
tion Partial prezygotic and postzygotic isolation ex-
ists between African and European populations of D.
melanogaster, which diverged only ~10 kya but now
occupy very dierent environments and show both ex-
perimental and genomic evidence for multiple incompat-
ibilities. We are developing this untapped system as a
prime model for the evolution of reproductive isolation.
* The Genetic Architecture of Adaptive Evolution When
traits evolve in nature, we'd like to understand how
many genes are involved, whether selection acts on
standing variation or new mutations, whether it ulti-
mately xes the causative variants, and how predictable
these changes are across populations evolving in paral-
lel. Our focus on local adaptation among Drosophila
melanogaster populations from contrasting natural en-122 EvolDir April 1, 2019
vironments provides a powerful and ecient system for
addressing these questions.

Berlin ComparativeGenomics
Oct7-11
Dear all, happy to inform you that the registrations
are now open for the 2nd edition of our Comparative
Genomics course in Berlin (Free University of Berlin)
When: 7-11 October 2019
Instructors:
Dr Fritz J. Sedlazeck (https://fritzsedlazeck.github.io/)
Prof. Dr. Ingo Ebersberger (https:/-
/scholar.google.com/citations?user=-
LOOY3kYAAAAJ&hl=en)
Course overview
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians into the eld of comparative genomics. Dier-
ent techniques will be introduced to identify single nu-
cleotide polymorphism (SNP) and structural variations
(SVs) as well as the annotation of these variations and
the assessment for their functional impact.
Course formatThe course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learn-
ing how to compare genomes and what can be learned
from genomic similarities as well as variations. It will
include information useful for both beginners and more
advanced users. We will start by introducing general
concepts of comparative genomics. On this basis, we
will then continue to describe all major analysis steps
from the raw sequencing data via the identication of
variations to an assessment of their impact on the phe-
notype.
Attendees should have a background in biology. There
will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practical ex-
ercises using command line Linux. We will therefore
dedicate one session to introduce basic and advanced
Linux concepts for processing data on Amazon cloud
(AWS). Attendees should have also some familiarity with
genomic data such as that arising from NGS sequencing
experiments.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
Setting up a comparative genomics analysis environment
with the CONDA package management system Identi-
cation of SNPs and SVs using de novo genome assembly
and read mapping strategies Assessment of strengths
and weaknesses of the dierent DNA sequencing tech-
nologies, Illumina, Pacic Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore,
for the detection of variations Strengths and pitfalls of
de novo assembly and mapping approaches for compar-
ative genomics Hands on experience of state of the art
methods to compare multiple genomes Annotation of
variations and comparative genomics analysis Familiar-
ity with biological sequence analysis in an evolutionary
context

EvolutionReligion Jul11-13
Join us for an HHMI-funded workshop at Brigham
Young University designed to build bridges between
Evolutionary Biology and Religion.
When: July 11 - 13, 2019
Where: BYU Campus, Provo, UT
Who: We invite any faculty members from an insti-
tution where students face conict between religious
inuences and learning evolutionary science. We require
that participants come in teams of three:
-A faculty member from a Biology-related discipline
who teaches undergraduate students in Biology -A fac-
ulty member from a theology-related discipline who can
speak to the predominant faith traditions of students
-A local minister representative of the majority of the
student body
Details: All travel and lodging expenses will be covered.
Additional stipends may be available for participation
in follow-up activities related to the research. Attendees
will be co-authoring a set of learning materials that
can be shared broadly and that are specic to a faith
tradition that oer students a way to reconcile faith
and evolution without promoting or degrading religion.
Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate
in the building of video vignettes with the same purpose.
To register, please visit https://goo.gl/forms/-
7VUDKz0DjTfADsWS2 Our Goal:
Many students struggle with the scientic information
presented to them as it may appear confrontational to
their religious beliefs. Well-meaning scientists have ap-
proached the intersection between faith and science in
ways that lengthen the divide between these two ways of
interpreting the world. Ultimately, our goal is to replace
these approaches with a 'Reconciliatory Model'. To
reconcile is to \cause to coexist in harmony"; to \make
or show to be compatible"; or to \restore friendly rela-
tions between" (Oxford Dictionary, 2017). By involving
theologians, scientists, and clergy in a combined eort
toward a solution, we can create a mutually respectful
and highly eective method to help students reconcile
these two ways of knowing toward a more scientically
literate society.

GeometricMorphometricsUsingR
Jul8-12
Dear Colleagues,
Registration is open for the course Introduction to Geo-
metric Morphometrics using (mostly) R.
Instructors: Dr. Paula Gonzlez (CONICET-HEC-
UNAJ, Argentina) and Dr. David Katz (University
of Calgary, Canada).
Dates and place: July 8th-12th, 2019, Alberta (Canada).
This course is intended as an introduction to the major
aspects of 2D and 3D landmark-based shape analysis.
While we will spend some time on shape theory and
mechanical aspects relevant statistical analyses, the goal
of doing so will be to develop your intuition for how
to&#8212;and how not to&#8212;design and interpret
your geometric morphometrics research.
Students will learn the foundations of geometric mor-
phometrics through lectures and daily exercises. The ex-
ercises are designed around a mouse skull shape sample
from a controlled experiment with longitudinal design,
though for most exercises, students are welcome to work
with their own data instead.
Students lacking a rudimentary understanding of R will
be asked to complete a short series of introductory exer-
cises prior to attending the course. Most analyses will
be done in R, although we will also use Meshlab for
landmarking 3D models, and tpsDig for 2D landmark-
ing.
The program includes analysis of relatedness (pedigree,
phylogeny) and morphological integration and modular-
ity.

MADPHYLO 2019: Madrid Workshop in Statistical
Phylogenetics
Where: Real Jardin Botanico (CSIC), Madrid, Spain
When: 10th-19th June 2019
www.madphylo.com Course overview:
Darwin founded the eld of evolutionary biology on the
concept that all organisms are related to one another
through an unknown evolutionary tree. Phylogenetic
or evolutionary inference has become an essential tool
in many disciplines across the life sciences, from molec-
ular epidemiology to paleontology. In this workshop,
the participants will learn the theoretical and technical
basis of stochastic modeling in evolutionary biology and
phylogenetics. The workshop will also provide full train-
ing in the open software RevBayes, an R-like interactive
environment based on graphical model concepts for the
modeling of complex evolutionary problems. At the end
of the workshop, the student will have an understand-
ing of the assumptions behind state-of-the-art methods
used in modern phylogenetic analysis, as well as being
able to build up new models from existing functions in
RevBayes.
Instructors:
The lecturers are prominent analytical systematists and
evolutionary biologists, who are behind the development
of many of the methodological and computing tools rou-
tinely used in modern phylogenetic inference and evo-
lutionary biology: Prof. John Huelsenbeck (University
of California, Berkeley), Prof. Brian Moore (UniversityApril 1, 2019 EvolDir 131
of California, Davis), Dr. Michael R. May (University
of California, Davis), Prof. Sebastian Hoehna (Univer-
sity Ludwig-Maximilians, Munich), . The Workshop is
organized and directed by Dr. Isabel Sanmartin (Real
Jardin Botanico, CSIC, Madrid), who will also lecture.
Workshop details:
The course will be taught from June 10, 2019 to June
19, 2019. Lectures and practicals will be tightly linked,
meaning that you will learn the theory and also how
to apply the theory on the same day. Students are en-
couraged to bring their own laptops. The tuition for
the course is deliberately low, at only 450 Euros. This
tuition includes coee breaks and an informal American-
style make-your-own-sandwich lunch every day of the
workshop. However, tuition does not include lodging.
You will be required to nd a place to stay if you are
from outside of Madrid.

(https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-
WO97K4QAAAAJ&hl=en)
Overview: This course will introduce scientists inter-
ested in biodiversity to the use of DNA-sequence data
to address questions that cannot be addressed by using
only morphological and ecological data in their studies.
After a short introduction on how to obtain DNA se-
quences and reliable molecular phylogenies, the focus of
the questions that could be addressed will be on taxon-
omy, community ecology, and comparative methods.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Understand how to read, interpret and obtain molecular
phylogenies, with a focus on the concepts and rationale
behind phylogenetic methods
- Learn tools from DNA taxonomy
- Learn how to include phylogenies in the analyses of
community ecology and in comparative analyses
- Hand-on experience on all the steps
- Learn how to R including molecular phylogenies in
ecological analyses

AnalysisOfIntegratedTraits Jun26
Short Course: Phylogenetic comparative analysis of inte-
grated anatomical traits https://scate.phenoscape.org/-
2019-workshop-cfp.html Where: Providence, RI When:
June 26, 2019 (Wednesday), 9 am-12 pm
Course overview:
Ontologies encode information about a domain of knowl-
edge, such as how anatomical structures are related,
which is crucial information for modeling character evo-
lution. Phenoscape, in its current Semantic Compar-
ative Analyses for Trait Evolution (SCATE; http://-
scate.phenoscape.org) project, is developing tools that
use the computable knowledge in ontologies to improve
phenotypic character modeling and inform analyses of
trait evolution. To train evolutionary biologists and
developers of comparative analysis tools to adopt these
new capabilities, the SCATE team will be holding a
short course on using ontologies in comparative analy-
ses of integrated anatomical traits, in conjunction with
iEvoBio and the Evolution Meetings, on June 26, 2019
in Providence, Rhode Island.
Attendees will learn how to use R packages such as
RPhenoscape (http://rphenoscape.phenoscape.org) to
access a knowledgebase of ontology-linked phenotypes
(kb.phenoscape.org), build character matrices that take
anatomical dependencies into account, and use these
to construct stochastic character maps on a phylogeny.
The course will also include a practical introduction to
community ontologies for biodiversity domain knowledge
(anatomy, taxonomy, phenotypic attribute).
Graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and software de-
velopers with interests in comparative analyses, mor-
phology, and phylogenetics are encouraged to apply.
Free registration: Applications accepted until May 15th
or capacity is reached. Register by lling out the

open source software packages for comparison and anal-
ysis of microbial communities, primarily based on high-
throughput amplicon sequencing data (such as SSU
rRNA) generated on a variety of platforms, but also sup-
porting analysis of other types of data (such as shotgun
metagenomic, metabolomics or proteomics). The main
Qiita deployment ( http://qiita.microbio.me/) allows
users to manage and analyze large studies, their meta-
data and the multiple data types generated from the
same samples. Additionally, it allows users to combine
their samples with other published and public studies
available in the system. QIIME 2 is a stand-alone envi-
ronment for the analysis of individual microbiome data
sets that can be used on your laptop, university compu-
tational resources, and cloud computing resources.
Course objectives: By the end of the course, participants
will be able to: 1) Understand the most recent QIIME2
and Qiita features for microbial community analysis 2)

Spatial modelling and analysis of adaptive genomic vari-
ation (SPGN01)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/spatial-modelling-
and-analysis-of-adaptive-genomic-variation-spgn01/
This course will be delivered by Dr. Matt Fitzpatrick
from the 17th - 21st June in Glasgow City Centre.
Course Overview: Local adaptation to climate and other
environmental drivers increasingly is being studied at
the molecular level using high-throughput sequencing
methods, with applications spanning both model andnon-model organisms. At the same time, statistical
tools for modeling and mapping patterns of biodiversity
have seen increasing application, including to the chal-
lenge of understanding the drivers of spatial variation in
adaptive genomic variation and mapping these patterns
under current and future climate. This 5-day course will
provide the skill set necessary to analyze sequence data
for signatures of natural selection and to apply spatial
modeling techniques to these patterns to quantify and
map population-level genetic variation using two spa-
tial modelling algorithms V Generalized Dissimilarity
Modelling (GDM) and Gradient Forest (GF).
The course will include introductory lectures, instruc-
tion on using the Linux command line for manipulation
of genomic data, guided computer coding in R, and
exercises for the participants, with an emphasis on visu-
alization and reproducible workows. Portions of each
day will be allotted for students to work through their
own datasets with the instructors.
This course is intended for research scientists, postdoc-
toral researchers, and graduate students interested in
learning how to analyze genomic data for signals of
adaptation using population genetic tools and the appli-
cation of spatial modeling understanding and mapping
landscape genomic patterns in R.
After successfully completing this course students will:
1) Understand the theory and techniques for detect-
ing signals of natural selection using genomic data, fo-
cusing on multi-population and landscape approaches
2) Understand the statistical underpinnings of spatial
modeling methods (GDM and GF) for analyzing and
mapping adaptive genomic variation 3) Be able to de-
velop, evaluate and apply GDM and GF for quantify-
ing and mapping spatial genetic patterns 4) Estimate
population-level vulnerability to climate change
Students are highly encouraged to bring their own data
to the course.

Introduction to Python for Biologists (IPYB06)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-python-for-biologists-ipyb06/ This course will be
delivered by Dr. Martin Jones from the 10th - 14th
June in Glasgow City Center.Course Overview:
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
It gives an overview of the language with an emphasis
on practical problem-solving, using examples and exer-
cises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics work.
After completing the workshop, students should be in
a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to
tackle problems in their own research and (2) continue
their Python education in a self-directed way. In biol-
ogy Python is often applied to sequence analysis and
data manipulation e.g. calculating base composition
statistics, removing adapter sequences, translating DNA
to protein, counting kmers, ltering tables etc. In this
course we use these applications as examples during
the exercises as a way of illustrating how to use the
tools that Python has because it makes sense given the
background of most of the people who attend. However,
it should be possible to apply what you learn to any
type of programming problem.
Course Program
Monday 10th V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Module 1: Introduction. We will start with a general
introduction to Python and explain why it is useful
and how learning to program can benet your research.
Some time will be taken to explain the format of the
course. We will outline the edit-run-x cycle of software
development and talk about how to avoid common text
editing errors. In this session, we also check that the
computing infrastructure for the rest of the course is in
place. Core concepts introduced: source code; text edi-
tors; whitespace; syntax and syntax error; and Python
versions.
Module 2: Output and text manipulation. This session
will show students how to write very simple programs
that produce output to the terminal and in doing so
become comfortable with editing and running Python
code. This session also introduces many of the technical
terms that well rely on in future sessions. We will run
through some examples of tools for working with text
and show how they work in the context of biological
sequence manipulation. We also cover dierent types
of errors and error messages and learn how to go about
xing them methodically. Core concepts introduced: ter-
minals; standard output; variables and naming; strings
and characters; special characters; output formatting;
statements; functions; methods; arguments; comments.
Tuesday 11th V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Module 3: File IO and user interfaces. We will discuss
about the importance of les in bioinformatics pipelines140 EvolDir April 1, 2019
and workows during this session, and we then explore
the Python interfaces for reading from and writing to
les. This involves introducing the idea of types and
objects and a bit of discussion about how Python inter-
acts with the operating system. The practical session
is spent combining the techniques from session 2 with
the le IO tools to create basic le-processing scripts.
Core concepts introduced: objects and classes; paths
and folders; relationships between variables and values;
text and binary les; newlines.
Module 4: Flow control 1: loops. A discussion of the
limitations of the techniques learned in session 3 quickly
reveals that ow control is required to write more so-
phisticated le-processing programs, at this point we
will progress on to the concept of loops. We look at
the way in which Python loops work, and how they can
be used in a variety of contexts. We explore the use
of loops and lists together to tackle some more dicult
problems. Core concepts introduced: lists and arrays;
blocks and indentation; variable scoping; iteration and
the iteration interface; ranges.
Wednesday 12th V Classes from 09:30 to 17.30
Module 5: Flow control 2: conditionals. We will use
the idea of decision-making in session 5 as a way to
introduce conditional tests and outline the dierent
building-blocks of conditions before showing how condi-
tions can be combined in an expressive way. We look
at the dierent ways that we can use conditions to con-
trol program ow, and how we can structure conditions
to keep programs readable. Core concepts introduced:
Truth and falsehood; Boolean logic; identity and equal-
ity; evaluation of statements; branching.
Module 6: Organizing and structuring code. In session
6 we will discuss functions that we would like to see in
Python before considering how we can add to our com-
putational toolbox by creating our own. We examine
the nuts and bolts of writing functions before looking
at best-practice ways of making them usable. We also
look at a couple of

Yunnan Metabarcoding School 2019 (China)
We are pleased to announce the Yunnan Metabarcoding
School, 2019 edition.
DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method of eu-
karyotic biodiversity assessment that combines two tech-
nologies: DNA taxonomy and high-throughput DNA
sequencing. Applications range widely, from environ-
mental impact assessment, to diet reconstruction, to
paleoecology, to targeted species detection, among oth-
ers. Metabarcoding draws from methods developed in
eld ecology, systematics and phylogenetics, molecular
biology, bioinformatics, and statistics.
The 2019 Yunnan edition is allied to the metabarcod-
ing school started by the metabarcoding.org team and
shares some of the same instructors. This edition will
be hosted by the Kunming Institute of Zoology and is
nanced by a special fund from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) focused on aspects of China's Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI). As such, the school will be
preceded by a separate, one-day international conference
to launch a Horizon Scanning exercise for the BRI.
The Yunnan Metabarcoding School will be held from
15 - 26 October 2019, in two sections.
14 Oct 2019: Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Confer-
ence, Horizon Scanning 15-21 Oct 2019: Metabarcoding
School I (MSI): Metabarcoding & Metagenomics 22-
26 Oct 2019: Metabarcoding School II (MSII): R &
Laboratory Practicals
The school will fund airfares, in-China ground travel,
lodging, and meals for 30 students (including Ph.D. stu-
dents, postdocs, and professional researchers, dened
broadly). Students will be responsible for providing a
suitable laptop computer (details below) and paying for
their own out-of-China ground travel, tourist visa, and
personal purchases.
MSI: Our goal is to host 15 students from within China
and 15 students from other countries.
MSII: We expect approximately half the MSI students
to stay on for MSII.

Please indicate if you wish to attend MSI or MSI and
II.
In the (likely) case that we receive more than 30 ap-
plications (or more than 15 applications from outside
China), preference will be given to students
1. whose described project in the cover letter is well
developed and likely to benet immediately from the
skills learned, 2. who come from a Belt and Road Ini-
tiative (BRI) country 3. who are able to demonstrate
basic uency in molecular-ecology and bioinformatic
techniques (e.g. can use Unix and R on the command
line, can teach how PCR works) 4. who have sucient
English-language skills
Students must bring a laptop computer with the fol-
lowing capacity: 8 GB RAM, 150 GB SSD free storage,
and natively boots into macOS or Ubuntu Linux.
We will assign preparatory homework to the accepted
students.

Curricula
The school will be divided into lectures and practi-
cals, taught in English, with Chinese-uent instructors
present.
Metabarcoding School I: The lectures will cover dierent
aspects of DNA metabarcoding and metagenomics as
applied to eukaryotes. The obitools and DAMe practi-
cals will let students run metabarcoding pipelines from
raw sequences to species x sample tables, plus visu-
alisations in R. The i/eDNA practical will introduce
students to water sampling using lters. We will also
run computer-based practicals in PCR primer design,
taxonomic assignment, and metagenomic methods as
applied to eukaryotic species (see Ji et al. 2019, Peel
et al. 2019). Note that this course does not cover
bacterial/archaeal/viral biodiversity.
All students will have to give a ash talk (7 mins) about
their project and how it will benet from DNA-based
methods of biodiversity assessment. In the evenings, we
will run a \Saw One, Did One, Now Teach One" exercise,
in which students will divide into groups of three and

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral144 EvolDir April 1, 2019
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
