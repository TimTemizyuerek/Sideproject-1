Nairobi MEEGID IX Oct30-Nov1
MEEGID IX Nairobi, Kenya. 30th October-1st Novem-
ber 2008. Call for conferences/symposia proposals and
papers
The 9th International Meeting “Molecular Epidemi-
ology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Dis-
eases” (MEEGID IX) will be held in Nairobi,
Kenya, 30th October-1st November 2008. As
for the 8 ﬁrst MEEGID meetings, it will be
co-organized by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/ ) in At-
lanta and the Institut de Recherche pour le
D´ eveloppement (IRD; http://www.ird.fr/ ) in France.
The meeting will be hosted by ICIPE ( http://-
www.icipe.org/ ), which will be co-organizer, together
with KEMRI ( http://www.kemri.org/ ), ILRI ( http:/-
/www.ilri.org/ ), CDC Kenya ( http://www.cdc.gov/-
malaria/cdcactivities/kenya.htm ) and the University of
Nairobi ( http://www.uonbi.ac.ke/ ).
The MEEGID meetings are organized in syn-
ergy with the new journal Infection, Genetics and
Evolution (Elsevier; http://www.elsevier.com/locate/-
meegid ), which scientiﬁc topic is identical to that of
the MEEGID. Launched only 6 years ago, Infection,
Genetics and Evolution is now published with 6 issues
per year, and is covered by Medline and Index Medicus,
starting from the 1st issue. It has been quoted 3.5/5.0
(“very good”) by the US National Library of Medicine.
It is now covered by ISI and an oﬃcial impact index
will be available soon. Nonoﬃcial 2005 impact fac-
tor has been evaluated by Elsevier at 3.554 ( http://-
www.th.ird.fr/downloads/edito.pdf ).
Communications on genetics, genomics, proteomics,
population biology, mathematical modelling, bioinfor-
matics are welcome. They can deal with the host, the
pathogen, or the vector in case of vector-borne diseases.
Papers considering host + pathogen or pathogen +
vector (co-evolution) are particularly encouraged. Allpathogens are within the scope of MEEGID: viruses,
parasitic protozoa, helminths, fungal organisms, prion.
All infectious models can be considered, including those
of veterinary or agronomical relevance.
The papers communicated for MEEGID IX will be pub-
lished in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and Evo-
lution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002) and MEEGID VIII (Bangkok, Thailand, Novem-
ber 2006). MEEGID IX will include 10-15 plenary lec-
tures, about 20 specialized symposia, 12-15 “express-
debates” (20 mn presentation by only one speaker fol-
lowed by 40 mn free discussion) and several poster ses-
sions.
Special emphasis through plenary lectures and sym-
posia will be given to health problems of particular
interest to Africa: AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, sleep-
ing sickness, ebola, cattle and crop pathogens. Plenary
lectures and symposia will also deal with transversal
topics such as population genetics or species concepts.
The congress is open to proposals of conferences and
symposia.
Awards will be attributed to the best communication,
the best communication by a student and the best com-
munication by a scientist from the Southern World on
a problem speciﬁcally relevant to these areas. Each
prizewinner will be oﬀered a free 2-year membership to
Infection, Genetics and Evolution.
Abstract submission deadline: 30th July 2008.
Registration Fee: 200.00 euros or equivalent in other
currencies; Reduced fees upon request for scientists
from developing countries who don’t have international
funds. Students are exempted from registration fees.
Preliminary registration and abstract submission are
possible by email (below). Please provide last name,
ﬁrst name, title, gender, nationality, scientiﬁc special-
ity, professional address, phone, fax, email and website
if available. Abstract should follow the format recom-
mended for Infection, Genetics and Evolution for list
of references, reference citations, etc. and should not
exceed 300 words. Please express your request, either
orgal communication or poster.

funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientiﬁc
Research (NWO), the Dutch government, the EU
and various private enterprises. The Institute of
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) is one
of the ten research institutes of the Faculty of Sciences.
In the context of IBEDs participation in the Centrefor Wetland Ecology there is a vacancy for a PhD stu-
dent 1,0 fte vacancy number 07-1038 For both internal
and external candidates project: Diversity and adapta-
tion in the genus Yellow Cress (Rorippa) in response to
ﬂooding
When faced with environmental stress, plants may ei-
ther try to avoid the environmental adversity or try
to tolerate it while it lasts. An avoidancetolerance
continuum may therefore provide an important axis of
specialisation underlying the diversity of populations
and communities. Our main objective is to investigate
whether an avoidance-tolerance trade-oﬀ in response to
ﬂooding underlies genetic diversity in the genus Ror-
ippa. More speciﬁcally, the following questions will be
addressed: 1) How do Rorippa plants respond to deep
and shallow ﬂooding and how do tolerance- and avoid-
ance related traits aﬀect growth under both types of
ﬂooding? We will expose diﬀerent genotypes of Ror-
ippa sylvestris and Rorippa amphibia and their hybrids
to clear and deep/turbid ﬂood water. In each treat-
ment we will measure traits related to tolerance and
avoidance strategy, assess how they are related to each
other, and how they aﬀect plant performance. 2) Is the
variation in these adaptive responses related to vari-
ation in (expression of) key genes that are known to
be involved in ﬂooding responses? We will link the
adaptive responses to variation in expression of candi-
date genes, building forth on the existing knowledge on
Arabidopsis thaliana. We will also assess the expres-
sion of the candidate genes during submergence in the
ﬁeld. 3) To which extent can variation in the selected
candidate genes explain current distribution of RorippaJuly 1, 2007 EvolDir 11
along ﬂooding gradients? To test if selection on toler-
ance traits predominates over other, unknown, selection
forces and demographic processes, we will compare ge-
netic variation in putative tolerance genes with selec-
tively neutral markers in natural Rorippa populations
encompassing a broad geographical range.
Tasks The department where PhD is going to work is
the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics.
IBED research covers a wide range of subjects, both in
pure fundamental and in applied research. Research
is directed to the development of fundamental knowl-
edge of the dynamics of ecosystems at all relevant levels,

Phd project: Dynamics of infectious diseases: mathe-
matical modelling and experiments
Lelystad, The Netherlands
Wageningen University, Department of Animal Sciences
Job descriptionThis research project aims to obtain a better under-
standing of the disease transmission during outbreaks
of highly transmissible diseases in livestock. The re-
search team where this project will be carried out
has developed experimental methods and mathemat-
ical modelling approaches for studying disease trans-
mission. Both these experiments and the mathematical
modelling play an important role in present-day think-
ing about control measures against disease spread. This
PhD project aims to expand the existing experimental
methods and modelling approaches to situations where
transmission occurs over some distance, for example be-
tween cages, between stables, or between farms. The
PhD student will be conducting experiments and de-
velop the models to analyze the experimental results.
This research project is funded by the Ministry of Agri-
culture, Nature and Food Quality. The relevance to
the Ministry lies in its need to design well-founded in-
tervention strategies for combating epidemic spread of
highly transmissible diseases in livestock, such as avian
inﬂuenza, classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth dis-
ease.
This research will be carried out in Lelystad, the
Netherlands, at the Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiol-
ogy cluster of the Division of Infectious Diseases of the
Animal Sciences Group (ASG), where experts both in
mathematical modelling and in conducting transmis-
sion experiments will provide guidance. The project
will be carried out under supervision of Prof. dr ir.
M.C.M. de Jong, head of the Quantitative Veterinary
Epidemiology group at Wageningen University, also
part of ASG.

Three funded PhD studentships in Population Ecology
and Population Genetics at the Professorship of Ecosys-
tem Management, ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
*Title:* Integrating genetic diversity and phenotypic
plasticity into plant population responses to climate
change in the Alps
*Start Date:* January 2008
The Professorship of Ecosystem Management is oﬀer-
ing three PhD positions in Plant Ecology and Ecological
Genetics to address the relative importance of intrinsic
adaptive variation, local (pre-) adaptation and pheno-
typic plasticity to Alpine plant populations abilities to
adapt to climate change.July 1, 2007 EvolDir 13
All three projects will be supervised by Prof. Dr.
Jaboury Ghazoul, Dr. Andrea R. Pluess and Dr. Chris
Kettle, and will form part of the BIOCHANGE plat-
form at ETH Zurich.
*Project: * Alpine plant populations are predicted to
shift to higher elevations in response to climate change.
Under such conditions core populations will move to
higher elevations currently occupied by peripheral pop-
ulations occupying the present species range limits.
Should conservation eﬀorts prioritize the current core
populations which are predicted to contain greater ge-
netic diversity or small isolated peripheral populations?
We will investigate the relative importance of intrin-
sic adaptive variation, local (pre-) adaptation and phe-
notypic plasticity to Alpine plant populations abilities
to adapt to climate change. Key questions include: 1)
Does local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in high-
altitude peripheral populations infer an advantage over
core populations under predicted climate change sce-
narios? 2) Do small peripheral populations which are
predicted to have lower genetic diversity than large cen-
tral populations, have reduced adaptive potential? 3)
Does gene ﬂow via pollen between core and peripheral
populations undermine local adaptation of peripheral
populations and can this lead to outbreeding depres-
sion. These questions will be addressed using ﬁeld-
based reciprocal transplant experiments, experimental
populations in climate-controlled chambers, artiﬁcial
inter-population breeding experiments and direct and
indirect measures of gene ﬂow using molecular mark-
ers.
*Requirements:* We are seeking three highly motivated
applicants, with a desire to work on the ecology and ge-
netics of alpine plants in the context of climate change.
Applicants should have a B.Sc and M.Sc degree, prefer-
ably with experience in experimental population biol-
ogy, statistics, and ideally molecular work. Excellent
spoken and written English is required, and German
would be highly advantageous though not strictly nec-
essary. Applicants should enjoy working both in the
ﬁeld (Swiss pre-alpine and alpine area) and in the labo-
ratory. The three PhD positions will be part of a team
of researchers working on the general theme of plant
responses to climate change in alpine systems, and will
also be members of the Ecosystem Management group,
led by Prof. Jaboury Ghazoul. Therefore, we place a
strong emphasis on cooperation and team work. Re-
quests for additional information on the three positions
oﬀered, or other informal enquiries, should be made

tion, CV and names and addresses of two aca-
demic referees to Dr. Andrea Pluess, by e-Mail (an-

Ecology / Plant Mating System Evolution
A 3-year graduate position is available at the Institute
of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, to work on plant
mating system evolution. The project seeks to under-
stand the eﬀect of the mating system on the genetic ar-
chitecture of morphological and life history traits and
on the ability to adapt to a changing environment.
Project description: Studies of plant mating systems
have long focused on the evolutionary advantages and
disadvantages of inbreeding and outbreeding. The
project reverses the chain of causation to ask how the
mating system aﬀects the genetic composition of a pop-
ulation. The research involves a combination of ﬁeld
surveys of realized mating systems in natural popula-
tions and assessments of genetic variance components
for a set of ecologically relevant traits. The work in-
cludes crossing experiments, molecular marker tech-
niques and quantitative genetics analysis.
The Institute of Integrative Biology consists
of a dozen groups working in diverse ﬁelds of
Ecology and Evolution. For more information,

INRA Rennes AphidEvolGenomics
PhD position available at INRA Rennes (France) on
Aphid Evolutionary Genomics (URGENT, deadline is
29 June 2007). The position is open to non-French
and French students. However, it is preferable that the
candidate has just obtained his “Master 2” in France.
Otherwise, there might be diﬃculties to obtain a proof
of equivalence (please contact the University of Rennes,
Ecole doctorale VAS in case of doubts).
The ﬁnancing for that position has been obtained; how-
ever, it is necessary that the candidates i) contact
me immediately ii) apply to the open competition or-
ganised by the University of Rennes (“Ecole doctorale
VAS”); the deadline for sending a written application
(including a CV, a program of the courses followed in
the last two years, the manuscript corresponding to the
“Master 2”, a letter of motivation) is extremely soon:
29 June 2007. The website of the “Ecole doctorale
VAS” is http://www.vas2.univ-rennes1.fr/ Attention,
navigating through this website is a diﬃcult adventure:
ﬁrst click on “Pr´ esentation”, then click on “Inscription
au concours 2007” in the left column.
The aim of the work is to use the growing sequence data
for aphids to study their genome in an evolutionary per-
spective, comparing it to that of other insects. A special
focus will be put on multigenic families, in order to de-
tect patterns speciﬁc to aphids, that would be related
to their adaptive potential. Most of the work will con-
sist in bioinformatic analyses, and phylogenetic studies.
The student will use data from the complete genome
sequencing of Acyrthosiphon pisum and EST collection
from diﬀerent aphid species. This will be a starting
point to describe the speciﬁcities of the aphid genome,
and for describing which genes have been duplicated
and which genes have atypical evolutionary rates (re-
laxed selection, positive selection, etc).

Iceland subterranean amphipods
PhD position at the University of Iceland, Reykjavik.
A PhD project on subterranean amphipods in Iceland
– phylogeny and population structure
Two species of subterranean amphipods, Crangonyx is-
landicus and Crymostygius thingvallensis, were recently
found in Iceland. This ﬁnding is unique for the biota
of Iceland, and northern Europe. These species are the
only endemic animals found in Iceland. Furthermore,
one of the species deﬁnes a new family within the Am-
phipoda. The two main aims of the project are:
1. The phylogeny of the two species. Did the two
species colonize Iceland after the last glacial period
or have they existed in Iceland throughout its geolog-
ical history, possibly for 40 million years? Aside from
the geographical isolation from other countries and a
northerly position, Iceland is a geologically young is-
land. Being centered on a volcanic hot spot on the
Atlantic ridge, its geology is aﬀected by volcanism and
tectonics. 2. Analyses of the population structure of
Crangonyx islandicus within Iceland. Does the diver-
gence of populations reﬂect geological separation of the
areas within Iceland? The study will relate genetical in-
formation and the extensive knowledge of the geology
of Iceland.July 1, 2007 EvolDir 15
Genetic relationship among and within species will be
studied by sequencing of three genes, mtDNA COI and
16S rRNA, and the nuclear gene 18S rRNA. These
genes have been extensively used in studies of phy-
logeny and biogeography. Sequence information is al-
ready known from several related species. In addition,
related species from Europe and N-America will be
sampled and sequenced. Variation in morphology and
life-history will be analysed. Applicants should have a
masters degree, with some experience of molecular bi-
ology, phylogenetics or population biology. Salary for
the PhD student are paid by the University of Iceland
research fund for doctoral studies. Further informa-

SPECIATION IN PLANTS ON AN OCEANIC IS-
LAND
PhD Studentship (restricted to UK residents) Imperial
College London
Location: Silwood Park Campus, Ascot
Supervision: Dr Vincent Savolainen (Imperial College
London & Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew), in collabora-
tion with Dr Bill Baker (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew),
Dr Darren Crayn (Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney), and
Mr Ian Hutton (Lord Howe Island)
The origin of species diversity has challenged biologists
for over two centuries. Charles Darwin recognized that
allopatry, species divergence resulting from geograph-
ical isolation, is a driving force of speciation, but he
also thought populations could diverge into separate
species in the absence of geographical isolation, a mech-
anism now called sympatric speciation. During the last
decade, mathematical models have shown that sym-
patric speciation is theoretically possible, but extremely
few examples have been documented in nature. Last
year, Savolainen and colleagues provided complete ev-idence for sympatric speciation in a case study of two
species of palm (Howea) on a remote oceanic island,
Lord Howe Island (LHI), Australia (Savolainen & al.
2006. Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic is-
land. Nature 441: 210-2133). Natures own coverage
of this paper claimed that [Lord Howe] Island hosts
double boost for evolutionary theory and that experts
say the big question now is whether sympatric specia-
tion is widespread or rare. Here the investigation will
be broadened to other vascular plants of LHI with the
aim to evaluate whether this evolutionary phenomenon
is more common than previously thought.
LHI is a minute subtropical island of less than 12 km2,
situated 580 km oﬀ the eastern coast of Australia. The
island was formed by volcanic activity 6.4-6.9 my ago.
Its ﬂora comprises 241 vascular plant species of which
105 are endemic. Geographic isolation in most out-
crossing angiosperms is not realistically possible on LHI
and thus it is an ideal site on which to test the four crite-
ria for sympatric speciation: 1) species sympatry, 2) sis-
ter relationships, 3) reproductive isolation, and 4) that
an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely. Numerous
plant genera, like Howea, are represented by more than
one endemic species on the island, which may well be
products of sympatric speciation. The student will look
at new pairs/groups of endemics:
(i) The student will combine existing DNA sequence
data from GenBank with new data collected and pro-
duced during the project to reconstruct evolutionary
relationships for ﬁve pairs/groups of endemic taxa. Us-
ing phylogenetic methodology, in each case the student
will evaluate whether theses island endemics are sister
taxa. Molecular clock methods will then be used to date
the divergence events, which will be compared with the
known geological history of LHI. (ii) During ﬁeldwork,
the student will also document species sympatry and
habitat variables at a ﬁne scale. Chromosome counts
will also be made for all of these species to evaluate for
possible polyploid or hybrid speciation events. (iii) The
expected distribution of interspeciﬁc divergence (Fst)
for species that evolved in allopatry is diﬀerent from
that expected for species that diverged with gene ﬂow.
For three pair/group of sympatric species on the island,
the student will sample at least 10 individuals from ﬁve
populations, estimate basic population genetic param-
eters, and produce genome scans. Genome scans will
consist of at least 200 variable AFLP loci, for which
Fst will be estimated and compared to neutral expec-
tations from simulations based on the observed average
Fst between the pairs of species. Computer simulations
and calculation of signiﬁcance levels will be carried out
with the software Dfdist and DetSel. Outlier loci will
be identiﬁed and the shape of the Fst distribution will16 EvolDir July 1, 2007
be described. The genome scans will reveal a signature
of the process of speciation, e.g. providing support for
sympatric or parapatric speciation versus independent
colonisation events on LHI.

PhD in Evolutionary Biology and Behavioural Ecology
available October 2007
Funding is available for a PhD student to study drifting
behaviour in social wasps. The project will explore the
costs and beneﬁts of nest drifting behaviour in Polistes
canadensis paper wasps using radio frequency identi-
ﬁcation (RFID) tagging technology to monitor inter-
nest movements. Drifting in this species has recently
been identiﬁed as an alternative reproductive strategy,
whereby drifting wasps may gain indirect ﬁtness by
helping raise related brood on several diﬀerent nests
(see Sumner et al. 2007 Current Biol. 17, 140-145).
The ideal candidate should have a strong background
in evolutionary biology and ecology (empirical and the-
oretical), and a keen interest in social evolution and
behaviour. Experience in molecular biology, ﬁeld-work
on insects, and behavioural observations are also highly
desirable. The student will jointly supervised by Dr

*PhD Scholarships in Cognitive Neuroethology*
Two Macquarie University Research Excellence Schol-
arships (MQRES) for PhD research in Cognitive Neu-
roethology are available in the laboratory of Dr Andrew
Barron at Macquarie University’s Centre for the Inte-
grative Study of Animal Behaviour (CISAB, http://-
galliform.bhs.mq.edu.au/˜cisab/ ) (Sydney, Australia).
Possible research topics include:
*1.* Analysis of the neural mechanisms underlying the
honeybee’s symbolic dance language. Dance behaviour
is the only clear example of symbolic communication in
invertebrates and has become a classic study in animal
behaviour, but the neural mechanisms generating this
symbolic language system are completely unknown.
*2.* Neural mechanisms of reward processing and
reward-seeking motivation in honeybees. Forager bees
spend their lives seeking and collecting ﬂoral rewards
to deliver to their nest mates. The aim of the project
is to identify the neuromolecular basis of this reward-
seeking drive, and to compare the mechanistic bases of
reward seeking for individual versus colony beneﬁt.
*3.* A comparative analysis of the mechanisms of queen
control in social bees. In ’primitive’ insect societies
queens maintain control by attacking workers, but para-
doxically largest societies are also most harmonious.
In ’advanced’ insect societies there has been a tran-
sition in the mechanism of queen control from assault18 EvolDir July 1, 2007
to pheromonal signals. The project will explore how
this transition has occurred and how advanced societies
evolved a state of social harmony.
For further information and discussion regarding
these projects, prospective applicants should contact
Dr Andrew Barron (andy@galliform.bhs.mq.edu.au
<mailto:andy@galliform.bhs.mq.edu.au >).
MQRES scholarships include a stipend currently
AU$19,616 p.a. tax exempt (2007), allowances for
relocation and thesis costs, international tuition fees
and overseas health cover for a maximum of 3.5 years
tenure. Additional support is available for research ex-
penses and travel (visiting overseas laboratories and
attending conferences). Casual teaching opportunities
may also be available within the Department.
Applicants should have completed qualiﬁcations equiv-
alent to a four-year Australian Bachelor degree with
First Class Honours (such as a Masters degree with sub-
stantial thesis component). Experience in some of the
following areas would be ideal: molecular biology, ani-
mal behaviour, neurobiology, behavioural ecology, neu-
roethology.

McGillU GuppyEvol
Graduate student opportunity: sexual selection and
contemporary evolution in guppiesProf. Andrew Hendry (biol-
ogy.mcgill.ca/faculty/hendry/) in the Dept. of
Biology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada,
is looking for a graduate student (MSc or PhD) to
study how sexual selection inﬂuences the contemporary
evolution of guppies. This work will be part of a larger
overall project titled: From Genes to Ecosystems: How
do Ecological and Evolutionary Processes Interact
in Nature? This overall project uses experimental
introductions of guppies in Trinidad to study the
ﬁne scale evolution of traits - and how this evolution
inﬂuences ecological processes (guppypool.umaine-
biology.net/guppyFIBR.html). If entering into an
MSc, the student would ﬁt into this overall project
by quantifying sexual selection and mate choice in
the introduced populations which would then allow
predictions regarding the evolution of male colour. If
entering into a PhD, the student would do the above
and also examine how mate choice evolves following
introduction to the new environment. This would
be the ﬁrst study examining the evolution of mate
choice in a contemporary population experiencing
evolutionary change.
Preference will be given to students who have obtained
whole or partial funding for their graduate studies (e.g.,
NSERC, NSF, EPA, FQRNT, SENACYT, CONA-
CYT, CONICYT). Depending on his/her interests, the
student might do their graduate work as a part of
the Neotropical Environment Option ( www.mcgill.ca/-
neo/). The student would start graduate school in Jan-
uary 2008 but would ideally also start working on their
project (with pay) in fall 2007.
Interested individuals should send their CV, tran-
scripts (unoﬃcial versions are OK), and a statement
of interest, motivation, and potential funding to an-
drew.hendry@mcgill.ca. Consideration of applicants
will begin immediately.

PhD Studentship: Climate change, environmenal vari-
ability and life- history evolution
A 3-year PhD studentship is available to examine how
life-histories might evolve as climate changes in the
coming decades. Both average climate and the variabil-
ity of key weather variables are predicted to change in
the coming decades, and this change would be expected
to impact on growth and survival. We aim to predict
how species might evolve in response to such changes.
The study system is a series of dune annual communi-
ties, linking to a new long-term project in which a series
of plots are being set up along an environmental tran-
sect from southern to northern Europe. The focus is
to develop and parameterise models that predict plant
growth and development as a function of key climatic
variables. The models will be analysed within an adap-
tive dynamics framework to predict how growth char-
acteristics will change with climate, and model predic-
tions will tested using observational and experimental
approaches.
The study will combine both ﬁeld and modelling ap-
proaches, with the opportunity for ﬁeld work in the
UK, France and Spain.
Applicants should have a background in biology, ecol-
ogy or environmental science. The studentship will of-
fer opportunities for training in population and evolu-
tionary modelling, as well as experimental design and
analysis.
The project will be supervised by Prof Robert Freckle-
ton and Dr Dylan Childs, both in the Department of

TrinityCollege HybridAsh
Graduate position Trinity College Dublin (TCD) &
Teagasc invites applications to undertake an MSc/PhD
research project entitled:
Identifying the scale of suspected hybrid ash (F. excel-
sior x F. angustifolia) in Ireland’
Ash is an important hardwood species for farm forestry
in Ireland. The Irish government introduced substan-
tial planting grants around 1992 for farmers to plant
trees with an extra premium for planting hardwood
species including ash. Consequently plants and seeds
of several species were imported to ﬁll the needs (from
various sources including France, Czech Rep, Poland
and the Netherlands). Many of these plantings devel-
oped poor morphology and growth. It was clear that
the problem was due to the source of the material and
that the imported material was probably hybrid ash
derived from F. excelsior and F. angustifolia. Today,
there are at least 100 aﬀorested sites in which suspected
hybrid ash was planted. There is a lack of understand-
ing of hybrid ash in general, its occurrence in Ireland,
and potential of it to interbreed with native ash. This
proposal therefore aims to carry out a set of morpholog-
ical and molecular DNA tests to characterise material
from suspected sites and to assess the potential of these
plantations to interbreed with indigenous ash.
This project will be jointly supervised by Dr Trevor
Hodkinson (TCD) and Dr Gerry Douglas (Teagasc Kin-
sealy) and collaborate with Nathalie Frascaria-Lacoste,
Universite Paris-Sud XI, Orsay, France. The student
will receive an annual tax free stipend of 21,000 Euro
for maintenance and to cover university fees. Fees are
approximately 5,000 Euro for EU students and 10,000
Euro for non-EU students. There will be opportuni-
ties for extra money from teaching and demonstrat-
ing on undergraduate courses and invigilating examina-
tions. The Graduate student will initially register for
an MSc at TCD under the terms of the Walsh Fellow-
ship Scheme and the work will be undertaken at Tea-
gasc, Kinsealy Research Centre, and the Department of
Botany TCD.
Applicants must have a ﬁrst or upper second class Bach-

Ph.D. Graduate Assistantships, Environmental Ge-
nomics at the University of Arkansas and University
of Nevada, Las Vegas
Two NSF-funded graduate research assistantships are
anticipated to support Ph.D. candidates interested in
functional genomics of adaptation to stressful environ-
ments. The project involves laboratory and ﬁeld ex-
periments designed to discover patterns of gene expres-
sion in populations of cactophilic Drosophila mojaven-
sis. Our general goals are to uncover whole-genome
patterns of gene expression in populations exposed to
natural abiotic and biotic stress. Ultimately, we wish
to pinpoint clusters of functionally interacting genes ex-
pressed throughout the life cycle in diﬀerent environ-
ments, and predict limits of phenotypic plasticity and
adaptation, particularly in response to stressful envi-
ronments and long-term global climate change. Lab-
oratory experiments will involve DNA microarrays to
study gene expression changes due to diﬀerent host
cacti and environmental stresses, as well as diﬀerences
in epicuticular hydrocarbons. Field-related work will
include monitoring of wild ﬂies, demography of wild
populations, and analysis of hydrocarbon and RNA
proﬁles. The positions are part of a collaborative
project involving the Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville,
and the Univ. of Nevada, Las Vegas. One research as-
sistantship will be available at each institution. Pleasenote that these positions are contingent upon receiving
ﬁnal funding approval from NSF.

New MSc-Program ‘Animal Biology and Biomedical
Sciences The Graduate School for Biomedical Sciences
Hannover at University of Veterinary Medicine Han-
nover Foundation (TiHo) oﬀers a research- oriented
Master of Science Program in “Animal Biology and
Biomedical Sciences” for German and foreign students.
This new modular Masters program presents a unique
combination of biology and veterinary medicine, with
a ﬂexible, modular curriculum that allows you to tai-
lor your study to match your particular interests. The
program is grouped into three specialist areas focus-
ing on - evolution, animal biodiversity and behaviour;
- cellular, developmental and systems neurobiology; -
infection biology.
During the ﬁrst semester, all three areas will be cov-
ered. In the second semester, you will select courses
of your choice from two of the three themes. The sec-
ond year (semesters 3 + 4), your study will focus your
studies on just one of these tracks.
Admission to the program requires a BSc degree in Bi-
ology, Biochemistry, Biomedicine or related subjects.We oﬀer a fast -track route (without master thesis) to
our PhD program for excellent students.
What you can expect TiHo is unique among institu-
tions for higher education in Germany in its possibil-
ity to provide interdisciplinary courses with subjects
ranging from Veterinary Sciences (e.g., what makes an
organism a pathogen?) to modern Evolutionary and
Conservation Genetics (evolutionary deﬁnition of con-
servation units), Behavioural Biology of Primates (e.g.,
acoustic communication and the origin of language),
and selected topics in Physiology, Cell Biology and Neu-
robiology.
The University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover is Ger-
many’s oldest independent establishment of veterinary
education with - research priorities in infectious dis-
eases, neuroscience, clinical research, animal health and
food safety - six clinics, 15 institutes, two interdisci-
plinary departments - aﬃliated institutes and ﬁeld sta-
tions for epidemiology and animal ecology - an animal
farm for teaching and research and the animal wel-
fare centre - the WHO Collaborating Centre ‘Veteri-
nary Public Health - the EU Reference Laboratory for
Classical Swine Fever - international partnerships and
cooperative agreements with more than 30 universities

Title: Population genetic analysis of a recent ﬁsh inva-July 1, 2007 EvolDir 23
sion: the topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva.
Background Evolutionary factors play a crucial role
during the invasion process, with recent empirical ev-
idence conﬁrming that post-introduction evolutionary
processes often determine whether invasive species ulti-
mately establish and disperse. Studies on genetic struc-
ture of invasive populations provide the basis for both
understanding evolution during the establishment pro-
cess and impact on native species. The MSc project will
use a molecular approach (microsatellites) to study the
invasion history of the topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasb-
ora parva, the most invasive ﬁsh in Europe. The candi-
date will work under supervision of Dr Bernd H¨ anﬂing
(University of Hull) in collaboration with Drs Rob Brit-
ton and Rudy Gozlan (University of Bournemouth)

Student Research Assistantship
A Graduate Student Research Assistantship is avail-
able to develop research in ecology, behavior and/or
evolution of insect pathogens, speciﬁcally to focus on
the interactions between bumble bees, environment and
pathogens and to participate in a multi-team eﬀort to
investigate causes of decline in North American bumble
bees. The student will join the Nation’s #1 ranked De-
partment of Entomology ( http://www.life.uiuc.edu/-
entomology/index.html ) at the University of Illinois,
and will have strong aﬃliation with the Illinois Natural
History Survey ( http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/ ) located onthe UIUC campus.
The research is multidisciplinary, and involves exten-
sive ﬁeldwork in both the midwestern and western U.S.
to collect data on abundance, distribution and pop-
ulation structure of bumble bees, several species of
which appear to be declining in abundance and dis-
tribution across the U.S. As bumble bees are among
the Nation’s most important wild pollinators, this is
cause for concern– eﬀective pollination is critical for
the health of most terrestrial ecosystems. In addition
to establishing the current status of targeted bumble
bee species, we are developing experimental protocols
for testing the potential role of pathogens in their popu-
lation decline, and performing DNA sequencing of pos-
sible pathogens. The principal goal of the research to
be developed by the student is to determine whether an
insect pathogen, such as Nosema bombi, a naturally oc-
curring microsporidium in European bumble bee popu-
lations, and found in commercially produced and wild
populations in North America, is important in the de-
cline of bumble bees in the U.S.
The research will be directed by Drs. Lee Solter

experience, such as molecular methods and statistical
analysis, computer programming, mathematical skills,
and other relevant expertise; 4. Names and contact in-
formation (e-mail, phone, address) for at least 3 people
that can provide reference letters. We will be assessing
applications during early July and will let you know
whether you have been selected for the position soon
thereafter. If selected, you will apply to the UIUC De-
partment of Entomology (research programs of each of
the faculty are listed on the department website) for
Fall 2007 or Spring 2008. Information on admission to
graduate school is available on the Department of Ento-24 EvolDir July 1, 2007
mology website. Final acceptance is subject to approval
by the faculty in the Dept of Entomology.
We expect to select a student who is highly motivated
to becoming a career scientist, who enjoys being cre-
ative and productive, has independent initiative, likes
problem-solving, works well with a team, and can work
eﬀectively under pressure. The student will join a team
of students focused on the systematics, ecology and evo-
lution of bees, and will be adding new research on the
potential role of pathogens in pollinator decline. We
expect to spend considerable time providing the stu-
dent with resources and the infrastructure they need to

ONE PhD POSITION IN ENTOMOLOGY AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEUCHATEL, SWITZERLANDJuly 1, 2007 EvolDir 27
Candidates will be given the opportunity to undertake
a PhD on ecological interactions in alpine ecosystems,
within the framework of the centres of interests of the
laboratory of Evolutionary Entomology: Evolutionary
Biology, Chemical Ecology, Tri-trophic interactions.
A possible PhD project would be to use species of the
genus Oreina to test the basic principles of warning
colour. These leaf beetles are brilliantly coloured in
metallic greens, blues and reds, which appears to be a
warning that they possess chemical defence. Learning
by predators of unpalatable prey species is expected to
produce strong purifying selection on warning colour,
since only recognised patterns are avoided. Yet the
genus Oreina is spectacularly polymorphic, showing ge-
ographic variation within species and multiple patterns
within a population.

AntImmunity
PhD Position: Collective immunity in ant societies Uni-
versity of Regensburg (Germany)
The PhD project aims to study how ant colonies cope
with the increased risk of disease transmission they face
as many highly related individuals live together in close
densities. The work will speciﬁcally address how ants
recognise parasites and diseased group members, which
behavioural and physiological parasite defences they
show, and how they organise the performance of hy-
gienic behaviour between group members. The project
therefore combines two research ﬁelds, the evolution of
insect societies and the study of innate immune sys-
tems.
Study methods are experimental infection (mostly with
fungal insect pathogens), manipulation of colony struc-
ture, behavioural observations, measurement of physi-
ological immune parameters, and gas chromatography
- mass spectrometry. The invasive garden ant and a
facultatively clonal ant are used as the main study or-
ganisms. Both study organisms and methods are es-

URennes WhereDoSpeciesAdapt
PhD theme in
Where do species respond to climate change? The role
of endemism and of margins of environmental gradients.
oﬀered within the competition for PhD fellowships at
University of Rennes 1, France.
!!! Deadline for inscription: 29 June 2007 (and super-
visors should be contacted before)
Obligatory dates for presentations by short-listed can-
didates: 10 / 11 / 12 July 2007.
Scientiﬁc background:
Contemporary ecology is implicitly based on the hy-
pothesis that phenotypes of species respond to changes
of their environment. These responses happen on the
level of diﬀerentiation of populations within species as
well as on the level of macroevolution of traits across
species. Recent studies, however, indicate that this fun-
damental hypothesis often lacks support. Species ex-
posed to changing climates, for instance, usually redis-
tribute in space, they migrate with their climate (Ack-
erly 2003, Int. J. Plant Scie.). Species that stay will
often be displaced by species that immigrate and are al-
ready well adapted to the novel climate. Consequently,
the climate niche of species usually remains very rigid
even across time periods of millions of years (for in-
stance Prinzing et al. 2001 Proc. R. Soc. B). Adap-
tive responses of phenotypes are thus replaced by mi-
grations and invasions. Overall, it is not obvious how
phenotypes of species can respond to new climates.
Recently, several hypotheses have been proposed to re-
solve this paradox. These hypotheses propose that an
adaptation or adaptive plasticity is likely to occur inJuly 1, 2007 EvolDir 29
particular situations:
(A) At the margin of climatic gradients. Two scenar-
ios have been suggested. First, phenotypic responses
appear at the margin where living conditions of estab-
lished species become increasingly extreme, provided
that species that are already well adapted to these con-
ditions cannot immigrate from outside or (closer to the
redaction in french?) where preadapted invasive species
are not available from the outside. Second, the re-
sponse appears at the margin where species face in-
creasingly favorable conditions and can thus expand
their range, leading to founder eﬀects and increased
phenotypic variability.
(B) As a function of endemism. Again, two scenarios
have been suggested: First, endemics are more respon-
sive as their genotypic adaptations to local conditions
are not diluted by genotypes arriving from outside. Sec-
ond, the endemics respond less, as they do not proﬁt
from an immigration of genotypes from regions with a
climate resembling the novel conditions arising at the
given locality.
These hypotheses will be studied for plant species, at
the level of intraspeciﬁc diﬀerentiation of populations,
and at the level of macroevolution of traits of traits
across species. For the ﬁrst level, we will use a system
that is currently going through major environmental
changes, with a well known history of colonization and
a number of endemic species: the subantarctic Kergue-
len Islands. In the ﬁeld, the student will characterize
climate and soil gradients, will sample diﬀerent species,
and culture plants for two generations in order to verify
the heritability of the phenotype. In the lab, the stu-
dent will measure vegetative and reproductive struc-
ture, characterize biochemical phenotypes and their
response to environmental conditions (metabolomics,
polyamines, growth regulators contributing to stress
tolerance; e.g.; Hennion et al. 2006; Heat Shock Pro-
teins will be studied in collaboration).
For the second, macroevolutionary, level we will proﬁt
from the regional ﬂora that is best known in terms of
phylogenetic relationships, life history traits, and distri-
bution along environmental gradients; the ﬂora of cen-
tral Europe. The student will reconstruct characters of
ancestors, i.e. their positions along environmental gra-
dients and their degree of endemism, within habitats
and regions. The student will identify macroevolution-
ary changes of life histories and certain physiological
traits. Finally (s)he will test whether endemism of an-
cestors, or their position along environmental gradients,
inﬂuence the evolution of the life history and ecophysi-
ology of the descendants.

Graduate Positions - Genetics of invading species.
Ph.D. and MS positions are available to begin
as early as September 2007 in the laboratory of
Dr. Cristescu( http://cronus.uwindsor.ca/users/m/-
mcris/main.nsf ).
The project involves analysis of hierarchical genetic
structure of invasive tunicates at diﬀerent spatial scales
and aims to i) characterize spatial and temporal pat-
terns of genetic structure during the establishment and
subsequent spread of two invasive tunicates; ii) iden-
tify potential sources and vectors of invasions; and iii)
address taxonomic problems related to color morphos-
pecies. Ideal candidates will have prior experience with
molecular genetics techniques (e.g. DNA sequencing)
but students without prior experience will be consid-
ered provided they are interested in using molecular
markers to understand species invasions. Priority will
be given to Canadian candidates, however exceptional
international students with outstanding GPA and with
ability to work well in a collaborative research atmo-
sphere will be considered.
Interested student should send their CV, a brief state-
ment of research interest, and a list of 3 references to:

Position: A Ph.D. research assistantship is available in
the Weinig lab at the University of Wyoming to work
in the area of evolutionary genetics/genomics.
Project: Genetic analysis of natural variation in the
control of ﬂowering timing and inﬂorescence architec-
ture in Brassica rapa
Using Brassica rapa, we are examining genetic mecha-
nisms that enable adaptation to seasonal climates. In
particular, we are looking at how temperature and pho-
toperiod interact to aﬀect ﬂowering time, inﬂorescence
architecture, ﬂoral morphology, and fruit set directly as
well as indirectly via eﬀects on circadian rhythm. The
circadian clock is ’set’ in response to both temperature
and photoperiod, but very little is known about the ge-
netic underpinnings of temperature compensation, i.e.,
why the clock does not simply cycle faster under high
relative to low temperatures. Moreover, there is lit-
tle understanding of how natural variation in circadian
rhythm aﬀects plant performance in seasonal settings or
of the genetic basis of quantitative reproductive traits.
Rob McClung, the PI on this grant, is focusing on the
genetic characterization of temperature compensation.
Another Co-PI on this grant, Rick Amasino, is heading
up a large mutant screen. Our role will be to a) QTL
map ﬂowering time and ﬂoral morphological traits un-
der variable simulated seasonal conditions, b) to evalu-
ate attendant changes in mating system and ﬁtness in a
ﬁeld setting, and c) screen some of the more interesting
mutants in the ﬁeld. We will also be performing studies
of molecular evolution of candidate loci.
There is a substantial training component to this grant
that includes the opportunity to visit labs of our col-
laborators to learn new techniques. The research as-
sistantship is a good opportunity for a student to gain
skills in population biological approaches, quantitativegenetics and basic molecular genetic approaches in the
framework of addressing evolutionary questions. As a
graduate RA, the student would assist in ongoing QTL
mapping and selection experiments while carrying out
PhD research.

PhD RESEARCHER IN BIOGEOLOGY
The Darwin Center for Biogeology is a virtual Dutch
research institute, partially funded by the Netherlands
Organization for Scientiﬁc Research (NWO), which
aims at performing cutting-edge science in the central
ﬁeld of Biogeology where Biology and Earth Sciences
meet. Its research mission is to understand the func-
tioning of global, regional and local ecosystems, focus-
ing on change and feedback at all time scales in and
between biotic and abiotic components of a changing
Earth.
We seek a candidate for a PhD position at Utrecht Uni-
versity within a recently funded program entitled:
Niche engineering and the evolution of biogeochemical
cycles through time
Modern marine environments are characterized by com-
plex faunal communities living in the sediment with
densities and diversities that vary depending on sedi-
ment type, availability of oxygen and organic matter
load arriving at the sea bottom. Some species play an
extraordinary role in creating suitable environments for
other taxa to live in. These keystone species, for exam-
ple deep burrowing lugworms, are regarded as niche en-
gineers. Through geological history, origination of such
niche engineers is hypothesized to have lead to sudden
bursts in evolution of other infaunal taxa.
This program is integrated in the Darwin Center for
Biogeology, and will be performed in close cooperation
with the Microbial Ecology group at the Netherlands
Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW, Yerseke). The pro-
gram has 2 projects, each project carried out by a PhD
student. Currently, we are looking for a candidate for
the PhD position concerning the project:
The eﬀects of bioirrigation on benthic foraminifera
The aim of this project is to study the eﬀects of theJuly 1, 2007 EvolDir 31
presence of various types of niche engineers on the
surrounding meiofauna, in particular the foraminiferal
population, and on biogeochemical cycling. Biotur-
bation, burrow ventilation, bioirrigation and grazing
are activities that may have a signiﬁcant impact on
the vertical distribution of benthic foraminifera in ma-
rine sediments. Alternatively, foraminifera seems to
have a considerable impact on the bacterial population
and, consequently, the biogeochemistry. The project
will involve laboratory experiments with the coupled
system biogeochemistry-bacteria-foraminifera in sedi-
ment cores with diﬀerent imposed biogeochemical con-
ditions, and with or without artiﬁcial bioirrigation. It
also involves ﬁeld sampling of marine sediments (Wad-
den Sea). This project will be supported by ongoing
modeling work within the research groups of Stratigra-
phy/Paleontology at Utrecht University and Microbial
Ecology group at NIOO-KNAW.
Qualiﬁcations: We are looking for a highly motivated
individual with excellent communication skills who are
interested in interdisciplinary research combining vari-
ous ﬁelds of biogeology and an MSc in an appropriate
ﬁeld.
Terms of employment: We oﬀer a full-time PhD posi-
tion for 4 years, with monthly salary starting at 1956,-
in the ﬁrst year to 2502,- in the last year of appoint-
ment. We also oﬀer a pension scheme, a collective
health insurance and ﬂexible employment conditions.
Conditions are based on the Collective Employment
Agreement of the Dutch Universities and are supple-
mented with a holiday allowance of 8 % per year and a
year-end bonus of 3%.

developing an innovative independent research project
while setting up their own group within a CNRS lab-
oratory. Successful applicants will receive a three year
grant (150 k for equipment and consumables), the pos-
sibility of hiring a postdoctoral fellow for two years, at
least 50 m2 of lab space and, whenever possible, tech-
nical assistance. At the end of the three years, the
ATIP team leaders may compete for a two year ex-
tension through the “ATIP Plus” programme. Eight
programmes concern speciﬁc research areas (Biodiver-
sity and ecosystem dynamics, Cell biology and Im-
munology, Developmental biology, Genetics, Microbi-
ology, Systems biology, Neurobiology: from molecular
to cognitive neurosciences, Structure-function relation-
ships, Dynamics of biomolecules and their assemblies),
and one (ATIP “Blanche”) is open to any project of
high scientiﬁc quality related to Life Sciences. Appli-
cations from scientists presently working in a foreign
country are particularly encouraged. Applicants must
be less than 40 years old, or have defended their PhD
thesis within the last ten years (exception may be made
for women with children). At the beginning of the
ATIP contract, applicants need not hold a permanent
position within a French research organisation such as
CNRS, INSERM or University. In this case, the CNRS
will hire the team leader, and salaries will range be-
tween 3,400 and 3,800 per month. However, he/she
must apply for and obtain such a tenured position in
order to be eligible for a possible two year extension
(“ATIP Plus” programme). Applications for tenured
positions are independent from the ATIP programme
and have to be submitted in parallel. Applicants are
not allowed to join a laboratory in which they have been

AFLP lineage sorting
Dear all,
Authors of phylogenetic studies (incl. myself) often
claim that AFLP overcome the problem of incomplete
lineage sorting by combining many independent loci.
Are there published studies addressing this e.g. with
simulations of AFLP data on species trees and evalua-
tion of the resulting phylogenies, or any other citeable
data/rationale supporting or rejecting this claim?

Batch Genbank
Dear EvolDir Colleagues,
I am wondering if there was some software(s) that could
be used for downloading several, for example, 100 se-
quences at the same time from GenBank? I mean I
know the accession numbers of these sequences (for ex-
ample EF100000 to EF102000), but it is almost impos-
sible for me to download these sequences one by one.
So, your kind reply to jinyong.hu@googlemail.com is
highly appreciated and will be great helpful for me and
for those with similar problems!
Looking forward to your kind reply!

Batch Genbank answers
Dear EvolDir Colleagues,
Many thanks to all the people sending their kind re-
ply concerning my question on batch downloading se-
quences from GenBank. I think all your suggestions arevery useful and work well. Among them, the simplest
way is just type like ”EF100000:EF102000[ACCN]” for
the users, like me, who are not familiar with scripts.
Or you can do some scripting with perl or R or other
softwares like bioedit, macvector....
Here I attached the answers to my question. Hearted
thanks are give to the colleagues helping me and also
to evoldir providing such a good platform to communi-
cate.
Have a nice time and good luck for your work and life!!
Sincerely yours,
Jinyong
Dear Jinyong and all other users of GenBank,
there is an easy (but not well known) way to achieve
this without any additional software. In your example,
just type the following term into the GenBank search
ﬁeld:
EF100000:EF102000[ACCN]
Please note the colon between the ﬁrst and last se-
quence and the ﬁnal term in square brackets.
Yours Martin.

Nucleotide should probably work
Go to NCBI home page and select CoreNucleotide or
just Nucleotide from the Search pull down menu and
just type in EF100000, EF102000, ... as many as you
want and then click on Go. Once you get the records
you can save it in any format you want. You don’t
need a script for this I would think. Good luck. Raja
Georgetown University - Show quoted text -
if you have some familiarity with Perl, I’d recommend
to take a look at BioPerl ( www.bioperl.org ). It comes
with variety of example scripts that probably already
do what you want, or will be easy to modify.
For running the example scripts you in fact don’t even
need to know Perl, though for modifying the scripts you
obviously do. You might simply ask your question on
the bioperl mailing list, though.

Bioedit can do this (under File- >retrieve from Gen-
Bank or GenPept), although it’s a bit clunky because
you can’t just enter a range of accession numbers - you
have to enter each as a separate number, with a car-50 EvolDir July 1, 2007
riage return in between. What I usually do is use Excel
to make a list (if you enter the ﬁrst number and then
“drag down” the cells, it will give you a sequential list
of #s), save it as text, and then cut and paste the list
into the window in Bioedit.
Don’t forget to click on the ticky box for “accession”
not “gi” or it won’t ﬁnd anything.
For really long lists it will take a while to download so
be patient - my suspicion is that the bottleneck is at
the GenBank end, not the program.
Bioedit is free and runs on Windows - if you do
a google search you should ﬁnd it multiple places -

Evol textbook
Dear evoldir members
Last week I asked about references for a good introduc-
tion book in evolution. I got many answers and here
is a summary of the book selections received. Many
thanks to all of you for the suggestions.
Most teachers in evolution seem to use:
- The books from Doug Futuyma - ’Evolutionary Biol-
ogy’ and his new one ’Evolution’. The book ’Evolution’
is a readily recognized descendant of the author’s pre-
vious textbook, Evolutionary Biology. However, it is
much shorter and is exclusively directed toward an un-
dergraduate audience (description from Amazon). If
you order a teacher version of the book ’Evolution’ it
comes along with a CD that contains powerpoint lec-
tures for each chapter.
- The other highly recommended textbook is the one
from Freeman & Herron, Evolutionary Analysis (4th
edition). This book comes with quite a few instructor
resources, including a CD with every graphic and pic-
ture from the book to facilitate creating powerpoints.
Other highly recommended textbooks for an introduc-
tion in evolution are:
- The new textbook ’Evolution’, by Nicholas H. Bar-
ton, Derek E.G. Briggs, Jonathan A. Eisen, David
B. Goldstein, Nipam H. Patel - coming out soon and
being highly recommended (check the link <http://-
www.evolution-textbook.org/ >http://www.evolution-
textbook.org/ >)
- ’Evolution: an introduction’ by Stephen C. Stearns &
Rolf F.Hoekstra
- ’Evolution’ by Mark Ridley
Finally other books that were suggested:
- ’What Evolution Is’ by Ernst Mayr
- A Very Short Introduction to Evolution (Oxford Uni-
versity Press, 2003) by Brian Charlesworth and Debo-
rah Charlesworth.- ’Discovering Evolutionary Ecology’ by Mayhew, Ox-
ford Univ Press, 2006
I hope this helps
I got a few powerpoint lectures, thank you very much!!!
Some other evoldir members asked me for those lec-
tures, I suppose I can forward the link to them? Those
who want the link please send me a personal email at

Evol textbook coursenotes
I was one who provided links to Powerpoint lectures
from my Genetics 500 lecture course. I’m happy to
share them, of course with the stipulation that the
lectures and their contents cannot be used commer-
cially/for proﬁt. Since I will be retired soon (11 days,
but who’s counting), I’d be pleased to see others get
some use of the lectures. This is a general genet-
ics course, and includes a few lectures on popula-
tion/evolutionary genetics (not evolution in general).
It is for undergraduates, but the lectures might be used
as a starting point for a beginning graduate course.
Incidentally, I’m retiring from teaching but will con-
tinue to do research.
Enjoy!

Evol textbook coursenotes 2
Dear colleagues,
Less than 24 hours after I posted the oﬀer to provide
people with my genetics lecture notes, I have 10 re-
quests. The interest is gratifying, and especially from
those people who already found the notes and liked
them. Last semester was the ﬁrst time I put all of my
lectures on Powerpoint and it is good that somebodyelse may get some use out of them.
Since the course web site for the genetics course in-
cludes some material provided by another lecturer,
and won’t be up indeﬁnitely anyway, I am going
to move my sections of it to my own web site
later today. When this process is completed, I’ll
make the URL available to everybody via links on
my personal web site at http://eebweb.arizona.edu/-
faculty/birky/home.html and also on my laboratory
web site at http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/birky/-
BirkyLab.html . I hope to ﬁnish this by late afternoon
but it might take until the end of tomorrow.
Later I may also add links to pdf ﬁles of some lectures
on the evolution of sex and the nature of species I gave
in our evolution core course for graduate students.
Thanks for your interest,

including three lectures in population and evolutionary
genetics. You can also download .pdf ﬁles of hand-
outs from some of my lectures given to our introduc-
tory evolution course for new graduate students, and a
computer simulation of random drift. There is also a
manual version of the simulation which is fun to do in
class and can help students understand the concept of
stochastic changes in gene frequencies.
I hope these will be helpful.

Evolution textbook
Dear Evoldir members,
Can anyone suggest me a good introducing textbook to
evolution?
And if the teaching experts of evoldir have powerpoint
courses on evolution, for master students in biology and
if they do not mind sharing it. I would be pleased to
have a look at it. As I am starting in September as a
teacher and have several courses to prepare, it is always
helpful to get some nice examples and good references
from colleagues.
Many thanks

Experimental Treeﬁnder
A new experimental TREEFINDER version is online
at:
www.treeﬁnder.de TREEFINDER is a software to
compute phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.
New features are:
- general model selection and testing, using - paired
sites tests with information criterion - parametric boot-
strap test with information criterion - output of sitewise
information criteria - two more information criteria:
HQ and CAIC - experimental simulated information
criterion of my own: SimIC - one more cost function
for rate smoothing: NPRS-LOG
I would appreciate expert comments about the SimIC.
This is an AIC-like information criterion, but using
an estimated “eﬀective” number of parameters as a
penalty. The eﬀective number of parameters is esti-
mated by parametric bootstrap as the gain in likelihoodthat is due to ﬁtting the noise of simulated data. It’s
described in the manual. For one thing I am not sure
whether the approach is new - sorry, I have here no
access to most of the literature. Second, the eﬀective
number of parameters often appears to diﬀer signiﬁ-
cantly from the true number of parameters. This raises
the question whether or not the traditional information
criteria such as AIC and BIC, when based on naive pa-
rameter counts, are applicable in phylogenetics at all.
Please note that I am still not being paid for my work
and that I had no income for years.

Freeze-drying lyophilizing
PlantTissue
Hello I would appreciate advice on how to freeze-dry
(lyophilize) plant tissue samples for maximum preser-
vation of DNA quality when storing the freeze-dried
samples at room temp. We currently use a Labconco
Lyophilizer and freeze-dry the prefrozen (at -80C) leaf
samples in batch mode in coin envelopes or plastic tubes
at about -10C shelf temp and -40C collector temp. for
3 to 7 days and store them sealed with a desiccant at
room temp. There are problems with DNA degrada-
tion especially in the tube-dried samples (desiccant is
outside the small tubes). I recently read about the need
for secondary drying at a temperature higher than am-
bient and a time 1/3 to 1/2 that required for primary
drying. What in your estimation is a safe shelf tem-
perature for secondary drying and a safe duration? Do
you think that our primary freeze-drying conditions are
optimal- or at least good enough? If you have a really
good, tested freeze-drying (Lyophilizing) protocol for
plant tissue samples or any other related helpful advise
I’d much appreciate a note from you.

Lion feeding behaviour
Hi colleagues, I am currently supervising an undergrad
dissertation comparing feeding aggression and ecology

these aspects of lion behaviour, or point me in a suit-
able direction? Thanks, Roger

Micro Stats advice
Dear all,
I’m involved in a PhD project on the use of stable
isotopes, morphological data and microsatellite alleles
to determine the possible origin of migratory birds,
namely two thrush species We now have three cate-
gories of data from UK and continental breeding pop-
ulations and birds in the UK in winter. These data
categories are: (1) wing length , (2) stable isotope ra-
tio values for carbon, deuterium and nitrogen and (3)
genotypes at about 6 microsatellite loci.
The aim would be to infer the origin of a bird in the
UK in winter given wing length (and age-class and sex),
stable isotope values (C, D and N) and alleles at each
microsatellite locus, by comparison with data for UK
and continental breeding birds of that species.
Plan A at the moment is just to do a standard dis-
criminant type of analysis, but maybe there are much
better ways to combine the data, such as a Bayesian ap-
proach. Other data such as ringing recovery patterns,
diﬀerences in UK winter and summer population sizes
etc could be used to inform priors.
Any advice on how to combine these three types of
data? Are there programmes combining quantitativeJuly 1, 2007 EvolDir 55
and genotypic data? Any help is appreciated.

Museum DNAextraction

you has experience with such old tissue? And what is
the best way of extracting DNA? Do you have any sug-gestions and tips on how to do this and which DNA

tions):
- Sigma: GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA
Miniprep Kit (for mammalian tissue, but we ourself
used it successfully on bird blood in EtOH) or - Qia-
gen: DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
It would be of great help to hear your opinions and
experiences.

Museum DNAextraction answers
Dear all,
Thank you very much for sharing your experience con-
cerning my question of how to extract DNA from
>100yr toe pads of birds. They were all extremely help-
ful.
Below are all the answers I got.
Julia Schroeder
I’m the sequencing technician in Irby Lovette’s lab and
was forwarded your ancient DNA request by one of our
postdocs.
I’ve done a ton of ancient DNA work on toe-pads from
50-150 yr old bird toe-pads. I use the qiagen kit for
extraction, with a few protocol modiﬁcations.
On the ﬁrst day, I chop up the toe-pad as much as pos-
sible with a razor blade, and add it to 40ul proteinase
and 160 buﬀer ATL. This digests overnight in a 55 de-
gree incubator on a shaker. The next morning, I vortex
the samples and if they still haven’t digested fully, I add
another 20ul proteniase and let them digest another 4
or 5 hours.
On the second day, I add the AL buﬀer and ethanol as
the protocol states, and if there are still chunky bits in
the tube, I centrifuge and add just the supernatant to
the column. If there is no chunky stuﬀ, add the whole56 EvolDir July 1, 2007
thing as normal.
The only other protocol change is the elution amount.
I elute with 50ul of the elution buﬀer, and repeat with
another 50ul into a second tube. I don’t bother checking
DNA yields with gels or spectrophotometry because I
don’t like “wasting” any DNA from scarce samples, and
our ancient DNA samples do not move back and forth
between our low-contamination room and the normal
lab.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me and
I’ll do my best to give advice.

I used the QIAamp tissue kit kit, supplemented with
DTT, for extraction from feathers and also a few toe
pads. My samples consisted mostly of feathers from 30-
40 years old museum skins, but I also extracted from a
few toe pads, and some of my material was up to 100
years old. Not surprisingly, older material yielded DNA
of worse quality. I attached two papers on genotyp-
ing and sequencing errors that were observed in exper-
iments with the old DNA, maybe you ﬁnd these useful.

To extract from museum skin or feathers, I digest
overnight at 55C with Proteinase K, DDT, and SDS.
The next day I do a short phenol/chloroform extrac-
tion then put through a modiﬁed version of the Qiagen
DNA minikit.
Cheers Hayley Lawrence
I extract DNA from 80-year old museum skins and have
successfully used a modiﬁcation of the DNeasy Tissue
kit that was ﬁrst suggested to me by Tasha Belﬁore of
UC- Berkeley.I ﬁrst perform several washes of the sam-
ples in 100% EtOH for ~24 hours, which gets rid of any
PCR inhibitors, such as the gasoline and butane that
were used to prepare the skins I’ve worked with. I can
provide the entire protocol if you are interested.
Have you seen the following paper by Mundy et al. Skin
from feet of museum specimens as a non-destructive
source of DNA for avian genotyping. The Auk. 1997.
114(1): 126-129? That may also be of help.

I’ve worked quite a bit with toe pads from bird mu-
seum skins. I did my work in Rob Fleischer’s lab at theSmithsonian Institution. Maybe someone from his lab
has already contacted you. But if not, I’ll try to track
down an electronic copy of the entire protocol so I can
email it to you. But we didn’t use a kit– we made our
own extraction solution and did phenol/chloroform ex-
traction followed by Centricon puriﬁcation. I had really
good luck with the procedure, but the key is to design
really small, overlapping fragments for PCR ( <200 bp
or even smaller). I noticed that I had less success with
samples that came from museums in tropical locations–
likely the DNA was degraded more from the heat and
humidity prior to the invention of air conditioning.
I’ll be in touch in a few days with the protocol.

I extracted DNA from a toe pad of a bird museum sam-
ple from, the 1950s. I just give you the details of my
protocol:
I used the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit and performed all
steps in a separated lab only for ancient DNA samples.
I took 0.0076g of the toe pad and cut it a bit (as possible
:-))
+ 180 µl ATL-Buﬀer
+ 20 µl proteinase K
30” vortex
55C water bath for overnight
during the next day I added 3 times 20 µl proteinase K
until everything was digested
the 3rd day:
+ 5µl RNA (to increase the crop of DNA)
+ 240 µl AL-buﬀer
vortex
incubate for 10’ 70C
+240 µl EtOH 96%, vortex, put in on the column and
follow the washing procedure in the protocol.

OpenJournal records
Perhaps, an interesting for the whole community?
Found in NATURE |Vol 447 |31 May 2007.
Open journals? records to give reviewers their due
SIR ? Sydney Brenner and Richard Robert?s request
in Correspondence (Nature 446, 725; 2007) for authors
to conserve records of their work and make them freely
accessible is of great importance to historians of sci-
ence. However, unlike an artist?s preparatory sketches
or a novelist?s drafts, scientiﬁc papers describing ma-
jor discoveries have gone through the process of peer
review. Reviewers often make signiﬁcant contributions
in shaping discoveries. They suggest new experiments,
propose novel interpretations and reject some papers
outright. Clearly, this is also important ?behind the
scenes? work by scientists usually at the forefront of
their discipline, and is an intrinsic part of the scientiﬁc
process. It is well worth keeping a record of such work,
for no history of science will be complete and accurate
without it. I therefore propose that journals? records
should be made publicly available after an adequate
lapse of time, including the names of reviewers and the
conﬁdential comments exchanged between editors and
reviewers. The Nobel Foundation makes all its records
available after 50 years, as do many governmental and
other institutions. This delay may be reduced for sci-
entiﬁc journals to, perhaps, 15 or 20 years. This is
also likely to have a positive impact on the peer-review
process itself. The scientiﬁc community and future his-
torians will gain from this transparency and from full
knowledge of all the events that have contributed to a
great discovery. Ariberto Fassati Wohl Virion Centre

PLoSCompBiol retraction
Dear Colleagues,
This to inform you that we must retract Hall, B.G.
and S. Salipante. 2007. Measures of clade conﬁdencedo not correlate with accuracy of phylogenetic Trees.
PLoS Comp. Biol 3: (3) e51 .
As a result of a bug in the Perl script used to compare
estimated trees with true trees, the clade conﬁdence
measures were sometimes associated with the incorrect
clades. The error was detected by the sharp eye of
Professor Sarah P. Otto of the University of British
Columbia. She noticed a discrepancy between the ex-
ample tree in Figure 1B and the results reported for
the gene nuoK in Table 1. At her request I sent her all
ten nuoK Bayesian trees. She painstakingly did a man-
ual comparison of those trees with the true trees and
concluded that for that data set there was a strong cor-
relation between clade conﬁdence and the probability of
a clade being true. She suggested to me the possibility
of a bug in the Perl script. Dr. Otto put in consider-
able eﬀort, and I want to acknowledge the generosity of
that eﬀort.
I have now corrected the script and re-analyzed the
trees in Tables 1-6. The results show that there are
strong correlations between clade conﬁdence and the
probability that a clade is valid for Bayesian poste-
rior probabilities and for Maximum Likelihood boot-
strap percentages and weaker correlations for Maxi-
mumn Likelihood aLRT values.
The major conclusion of our paper, as given in its title,
is therefore invalid and the paper must be retracted.
Because of the importance of measures such as boot-
strap percentages and posterior probabilities to the ﬁeld
of phylogenetics, it is important to retract that conclu-
sion as quickly and publicly as possible.
It is important to stress that the responsibility for the
necessity of retracting our paper is entirely mine, and
that my co- author Stephen J. Salipante bears none of
the responsibility. I wrote the Perl script and failed to
check its accuracy suﬃciently. Sincerely,
Barry G. Hall

PlantMicro question
Hi all, I have a new microsatellite marker obtained from
a dicot’s enriched genomic library, (AAAG)25, that
shows only one allele per individual. This microsatellite
is highly polymorphic (at least compared to the rest I
isolated) and is the only one in a set of 12 that shows no
heterozygotes. I Blasted the sequence and the closest
hits to the ﬂanking regions were mitochondrial NADH
dehydrogenase genes of other plants. Being so variable,
its mitochondrial origin is unlikely and I am thinking it
is actually a NUMT. However, it is really puzzling that
it shows only one allele per individual. I hope some-
one can give me some light about this microsatellite.
Thanks,
Alejandro anettel@nature.berkeley.edu
Sequence how many clones answers
Dear All
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to thehuge response regarding my recent query concerning
?How many clones should I sequence ? below?
?When cloning and identifying individual alleles of
mixed PCR products, a key question is how many
clones do I have to sequence to ensure that I have ap-
proached a good probability (eg 95%) that I have iden-
tiﬁed all diﬀerent copies. In the past when I have been
isolating two heterozygotic copies of a nuclear marker,
simply sequencing ﬁve colonies always identiﬁed the two
variants. But how many colonies would I have to se-
quence if there were 3, 4, 5, .... 20 etc...??
Many solutions have been supplied and I have taken
the liberty of reproducing most contributions below.
Some favour experimental approaches such as SSCP,
others, standard probability solutions, binomial calcu-
lations and R scripts, poisson distribution, accumula-
tion curves, online calculators and repeated warnings of
recombinant cloning issues. Thank you for the compre-
hensive response and please take what you would like
to from the following collation.
Sincere apologies to any contributors that I may not
have replied directly to and please note that some con-
tributions have not been reposted due to txt/.html con-
version issues/duplication/attachment problems.
Hopefully, we should be able to better gauge how many
sequencing reactions we should now be expending on
complex cloning mixtures.
With very best wishes and thanks
Si
Dear Si Creer,
If the two copies are present in equal numbers in your
pcr mix, this is easy to calculate. The probability to
obtain sequences of both copies, is (1 - probability that
all sequenced clones are identical): 1 - 2*(0.5)n , with
n=the number of sequenced clones.
If you want to have 0.95 probability of having sequenced
both copies, 1 - 2*(0.5)n=0.95 - >n=5.3
This means that you will have to sequence 6 clones to
have a >95 % probability. With 5 sequenced clones, the
probability to have both copies is 1-2*(0.5)5 = 0.9375.

calculating the probability of missing one of the two
alleles under the assumption that the two alleles are60 EvolDir July 1, 2007
ampliﬁed and cloned with the same probability is very
easy. Sort of white and black balls picked out of a sack
(with replacement). I kind of remember the number of
clones to be six if you want to go under 5% of probabil-
ity of missing one of the two alleles in an heterozygote.
But you can calculate this based on the ploidy of your
system.
But do the assumptions hold ? I am not sure. This is
a starting point, nevertheless.

Here is a quick and easy way:
Assuming you have a diploid organism and thus two
PCR products in equal or near proportions and have
one sequence already in the bag, then the chance that
you pull the wrong one (probability of a miss) next time
is 0.5 and the chance that you do so the next time as
well is 0.5 x 0.5..........
So as you have set the acceptable probability of a miss
at 0.05, so all you have to do is keep pushing the but-
tons on your calculator to multiply 0.5 by itself until
the answer on the display is <0.05. If you have kept
count of the number of times you pressed the button,
then that is how many clones you need to sequence.
This method works for any probability level or any frac-
tional representation of what you are after in the mix-
ture. It is standard library screening question and can
be solved with a fancy formula using logs and other
horrid stuﬀ. My way is easier if you can keep count.
Hope this helps

Sequencing costs
Dear All
in an era when DNA sequencing should be getting
cheaper, we have been hit by a doubling of prices by
our favoured supplier (from £1 to£2 to run a sample
(not including tax)). Another supplier that recently
oﬀered sequencing at £0.50 a sample has also just in-
creased theirs to £2.
In order to help drive down costs, it would probably
be helpful to circulate details of the cheapest suppliers
amongst the community. So if you can recommend a
company, then please let me know. If results are in-
teresting then I will send out another email to evoldir
with a summary.
My aim is to ﬁnd a 50 pence / 50 cent company!
I am primarily interested in companies that run out
PCR products (I have a PCR machine but not a se-
quencer, after all). To try to categorise things, please
pay attention to:
1) Cost to electrophorese sample only a) Individual
tubes b) 48 well or 96 well plates (usually supplied as
precipitated products)
2) Cost to do PCR reactions, clean up and run c) Indi-
vidual tubes d) Plates.
3) Location of company
4) General reliability / turn-around time
I understand that there are many local services but of-July 1, 2007 EvolDir 61
ten they are restricted to a particular set of users, so
not of use to the general public - please do not reply
with details of these.

Software PGEToolbox
Dear All,
PGEToolbox is a Matlab-based program for analysis of
polymorphism and divergence data in population genet-
ics and evolution. It computes basic statistics of DNA
sequence variation and carries out neutrality tests, such
as Tajima’s D test, Fu & Li’s tests and Fay & Wu’s
H test. The signiﬁcance of tests is determined from
the distribution of the statistics obtained by coalescent
simulation. The toolbox performs McDonald-Kreitman
test (and several extensions), and also contains func-
tions for handling SNP genotype and haplotype data.
The latest version of the program can be obtained from:

Software Simprot v1 01
Dear EvolDir members
We are releasing a new version of our protein align-
ment simulation package, Simprot. Version 1.01 incor-
porates new features and improvements to the olderversion. Simprot is a cross-platform application that
runs on Windows and Linux (pre-compiled version with
gcc 4.1 on Fedora Core 5). The program allows for sev-
eral models of amino acid substitution (PAM, JTT and
PMB), allows for gamma distributed sites rates accord-
ing to Yang’s model, and implements a parameterised
Qian and Goldstein distribution model for insertion and
deletion.
New features and improvements:
- root sequence input - from a sequence ﬁle or directly
on the interface - ability to simulate multiple protein
segments with distinct evolutionary histories, either dif-
ferent parameters or diﬀerent phylogenetic trees or both
- automatic detection of taxa when diﬀerent trees are
used to simulate multiple segments
The program has been developed in C/C++ and was
published on BMC Bioinformatics:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/236 To
download Simprot go to
http://www.uhnresearch.ca/labs/tillier/-
software.htm#3 A Windows installation package
and a Linux tarball are available. As the distributed
Linux version is precompiled, if you require a pre-
compiled executable to another distribution/system
conﬁguration just contact us on the email address
listed in the program’s documentation.

Software msatcommander
I have been working for some time with the ﬁne folks
from Savannah River Ecology Lab on a software pack-
age for microsatellite array searching, primer design,
and 5’ tagging (m13, CAG, or custom tag sequences) for
polymorphism testing (see Glenn and Schable, Methods
in Enzymology, 2005). We had a version for locating
repeat arrays that some of you may have used (msat-
commander <=0.4.5) and some scripts (msatprimer)
for automated primer design and tagging using results
output from msatcommander.
These have now been integrated into an “all-inclusive”
application with a GUI. Changes/features in the most
recent version (0.8.1) include:62 EvolDir July 1, 2007
+ addition of primer design functionality using Primer3
as the design engine + addition of primer tagging func-
tionality (also uses Primer3) + addition of a function
to combine microsatellite arrays within a user-speciﬁed
range (in bp) + addition of length-qualiﬁcations for lo-
cated microsatellite arrays
Prior to downloading and/or using the program, please
look at the FAQ. Both the FAQ and downloads may be
found at the website:
http://code.google.com/p/msatcommander/ OSX
(10.4 or greater) and Windows XP executables are
available. Linux users can download a tarball of the
source or check the source out from the Subversion
repository (be sure to check the README.UNIX).
Running the program on Linux has been *very* lightly
tested. Additional information regarding features, etc.
may be found on the website. I also have a program
note in press that describes and formally announces
the software.
If you have suggestions for the program or think you
have identiﬁed a problem and/or bug, please send an
email to:
msatcommander-discuss@googlegroups.com
Email sent to this address will be archived and is search-
able by the general public.
Thanks go to Travis Glenn, Nick Crawford, Bettina
Harr, Julie Glenn, Olga Tsyusko, Abigail Fusaro,
Nancy Schable, Jennifer Ness, and Maureen Peters for
providing extremely helpful suggestions and/or com-
ments regarding the software in its various, earlier

I have a list of trees (from a Bayesian analysis) and I
would like to get the variance-covariance matrices for
all of them to use in comparative analyses. While I
know how to get the matrix for a single tree (say in R),
I am having trouble automating it for a list of trees. So
I hoping that there is a program that might already do
this. If the program generated matrices under multiple
models (e.g. Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck)
that would be a bonus, but just Brownian would be a
start.
Thanks in advance for your help!

Porto, Portugal
A Postdoctoral position is available in the Group of
Genetics, Evolution and Pathology, directed by Jorge
Rocha, at the Institute of Molecular Pathology and
Immunology of the University of Porto (IPATIMUP),
Porto, Portugal. Our research team is particularly in-
terested on aspects of human genetic variation linked
to adaptive evolution and their implications in health
and disease. We aim to use serine protease inhibitors
as models to analyze the impact of natural selection on
current health patterns of human populations through
the use of both experimental and theoretical tools. We
have found previously evidences for a signature of nat-
ural selection among one of these genes and since serine
protease inhibitors are known to be enrolled in many bi-
ological functions, including immune response and re-
production, they represent good candidates for natu-
ral selection. The successful candidate is expected to
collaborate closely with Susana Seixas in the project

tionary Biology is available to work with Pr Fran¸ cois
Bretagnolle and Bruno Chauvel, in the Biology and
Management of Weed (BGA) Laboratory of the Uni-
versity of Burgundy, ENESAD and INRA The project
consists in using phenotypic and microsatellites markers
to compare introduced invasive and introduced histori-
cal non invasive populations of Ambrosia artemisiifolia
in France.
Ambrosia artemisiifolia was recurrently and indepen-
dently introduced in France at the end of the 19th
and at beginning of the 20th. Some populations, after
a lag phase, started to expand considerably although
others remained stable and persist in localised popula-
tions. Moreover some historical populations have been
collected in large number of individuals in herbarium
collections. This situation allows comparing the ge-
netic structure of invasive and historical non invasive
populations based on phenotypic and neutral markers.
Moreover, the existence of consistent herbarium collec-
tions of invasive and non invasive populations that still
persist allows detecting evolutionary patterns through
the time by the comparative analysis of neutral varia-
tion between ancient and actual DNA. The Weed Bi-
ology and Management laboratory in Dijon is the only
INRA site dealing with weeds. Its activities focus on
weeds biology, their management and the conservation
of the biodiversity of weed species and communities in
agricultural landscape. For detailed information about
the research team visit http://www.dijon.inra.fr/bga/-

UParisXI DNABarcoding
classiﬁcationPostdoctoral fellowship on Classiﬁcation methods for
DNA barcoding.
DNA Barcoding consists in assigning an individual to a
given species according to the sequence of this individ-
ual at a given locus (for the animals, often a fraction
of the COI mitochondrial DNA gene). The technique
consists ﬁrst in sequencing a sample of reference indi-
viduals for which the taxonomic status is unambiguous.
This reference sample is then used as a training data
set for a classiﬁcation algorithm, which aims at assign-
ing newly sampled individuals to a given species on the
basis of their DNA sequence only.
The postdoctoral fellow will work in particular in the
development and comparison of the eﬃciency of vari-
ous classiﬁcation algorithms in this context. These al-
gorithms include classical phylogenetic methods (e.g.
neighbour joining, maximum likelihood), statistical
classiﬁcation methods (e.g. CART, Random For-
est, neural networks, kernel and SVM methods) and
coalescent-based methods. Methods that take advan-
tage of recent advances in statistical learning and in-
ference and in population genetics will be favoured in
particular. The comparisons will be carried out on sim-
ulated data sets and also on well-characterized exper-
imental data sets. In particular, the impact on the
eﬃciency of the diﬀerent methods of events like gene
ﬂow between species or population expansions will be
investigated. The contribution of additional informa-
tion at nuclear loci will also be considered. Finally the
question of the detection of new species might also be
addressed.
The position is opened for one year with a possible ex-
tension of nine months. It should start in September
2007. The salary will be around 1800 euros/month.
The postdoctoral fellow will be mainly located at the
Unite Mathematiques et Informatique Appliquees of
the INRA - Jouy-en-Josas, near Paris, in strong interac-
tions with two other laboratories (see below). A strong
background in mathematics, statistics and computer
science is requested for this position. An experience
in interacting with biologists, especially population ge-
neticists, will be a plus.
Interested candidates are invited to submit by email to
C. Laredo and F. Austerlitz (see addresses below) the
following elements.

evant publications - an application letter - the names
and e-mail addresses of three referees.

Position: A 3-yr post-doctoral fellowship is available in
the Weinig lab at the University of Wyoming to work
in the area of evolutionary genetics/genomics.
Project: Genetic analysis of natural variation in the
control of ﬂowering timing and inﬂorescence architec-
ture in Brassica rapa
Using Brassica rapa, we are examining genetic mecha-
nisms that enable adaptation to seasonal climates. In
particular, we are looking at how temperature and pho-
toperiod interact to aﬀect ﬂowering time, inﬂorescence
architecture, ﬂoral morphology, and fruit set directly as
well as indirectly via eﬀects on circadian rhythm. The
circadian clock is ’set’ in response to both temperature
and photoperiod, but very little is known about the ge-
netic underpinnings of temperature compensation, i.e.,
why the clock does not simply cycle faster under high
relative to low temperatures. Moreover, there is lit-
tle understanding of how natural variation in circadian
rhythm aﬀects plant performance in seasonal settings or
of the genetic basis of quantitative reproductive traits.
Rob McClung, the PI on this grant, is focusing on the
genetic characterization of temperature compensation.
Another Co-PI on this grant, Rick Amasino, is heading
up a large mutant screen. Our role will be to a) QTL
map ﬂowering time and ﬂoral morphological traits un-
der variable simulated seasonal conditions, b) to evalu-
ate attendant changes in mating system and ﬁtness in a
ﬁeld setting, and c) screen some of the more interesting
mutants in the ﬁeld. We will also be performing stud-
ies of molecular evolution of candidate loci. There is
a substantial training component to this grant that in-
cludes the opportunity to visit labs of our collaborators
to learn new techniques.

We are seeking researchers interested in joining our
Computational Genetics program in Uppsala, Sweden.
We are interested in understanding the genetics un-
derlying complex traits taking a computational ap-
proach. Projects are often, but do not necessarily have
to be, inspired by problems or opportunities that ad-
vent from experimental data. We encourage scientists
to form and develop their projects to suit their in-
terests and abilities within the framework of existing
funding. We also support grant proposals from indi-
viduals that wish to pursue individual projects. The
project portfolio in the group will thus vary, but we
usually have ongoing projects in the ﬁeld of statistical
and computational methods in genetics, genetic model-
ing, exploratory analyses of experimental datasets and
experiments to validate interesting biological ﬁndings.
A common theme in our research is epistasis. We are ac-
tively developing models, algorithms and tools for large
scale screening and interpretation of the genetic eﬀects
of epistatic QTL in regulating complex trait expression.
Our tools have mostly been used to study the impor-
tance of epistasis in phenotypic evolution using data
from divergent crosses between domesticated animals.
We aim to integrate researchers with diﬀerent back-
grounds both within and across traditional scientiﬁc
disciplines. We do, however foresee that you have a
relevant scientiﬁc education (Ph.D. degree or similar)
and an interest in Quantitative-, Population- and Evo-
lutionary Genetics. A strong mathematical / statistical
background and programming experience is an advan-
tage

C. elegans Post-doc position
On gene-environment interactions in Caenorhabditis el-
egans using genetical genomics
Job description It is widely documented that envi-
ronmental changes will induce diﬀerential expression
of genes, yet it is unknown how these patterns of
environment-induced expression plasticity are inherited
and how they diﬀer between genetically divergent in-
dividuals of a biological species. We use recombinant
inbred lines of the nematode C. elegans and measure
genome-wide gene expression (genetical genomics) at
diﬀerent environmental conditions. Using statistical
analysis tools developed for quantitative trait locus
(QTL) mapping, we aim to detect genes with genet-
ically determined diﬀerences in their plastic response
to environmental changes. Our previous results show
that diﬀerential responses of diﬀerent genotypes to en-
vironmental changes are widespread. The candidate
will study the heritable component of plasticity of gene
transcription regulation to enhance our understand-
ing of the environmental forces that drive evolutionary
adaptation. Recent papers of our group include:

ALREADY APPLIED, could you send me an e-mail
(chikhi@cict.fr) just to mention that and I will check
that your data have not been lost.
If you have NOT APPLIED YET, and wish to, the
CORRECT LINK is: http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/-
node/view/91 You will then need to look for the “ESF
Conservation genetics and Fragmentation” workshop
and click on “Application” to ﬁll the application. Oth-
erwise, you can also go the IGC main page ( http://-
www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ ) and click on the “Workshops

Dear evoldir members, A ESF ConGen ( http://-
www.esf.org/congen/ ) funded workshop entitled “Pop-
ulation genetics modelling and habitat fragmentation:
separating recent and ancient events for eﬃcient con-
servation” will be held at the Instituto Gulbenkian
de Ciˆ encias in Oeiras ( http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ )
from the 19 to 21 Sept 2007.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together special-
ists from diﬀerent areas related either to conservation
biology and population genetics, including statistical
modelling. We shall discuss the current needs of con-
servation biologists in connection with the achievements
and limitations of current population genetics methods.
Discussions will revolve around case studies, and ongo-
ing theoretical work to unravel the past demography of
species. One aim is to show conservation biologists theexistence of tools that can be applied to infer the past
of endangered species and that this knowledge can be
used to improve conservation strategies. Another aim
is to show theoreticians that interesting inference prob-
lems still need to be addressed in conservation biology.
Case studies, theoretical work and software related pre-
sentations will all be represented during the workshop.
Current invited speakers are (in alphabetical order):
D. Balding, M. Beaumont C. Bessa-Gomes, B. Crouau-
Roy M. Currat, L. Excoﬃer P. Garnier-G´ er´ e, B.
Goossens D. Hudson, C. Lavigne R. Nielsen, U. Rade-
spiel I. Togan, L. Vigilant
The Workshop aims at favouring discussion between
participants and is thus open to up to 25 participants
in addition to the invitees mentioned above. Local costs
(meals and lodging close to the Instituto Gulbenkian de
Ciˆ encias) will be taken care of for *all 25* participants.
Moreover, a limited number of grants will be given to
participants to reimburse partly ﬂight tickets.
The selection of participants will be based on scientiﬁc
criteria and on the need to maintain a balance between
theoretical and case studies. Participants coming from
ConGen contributing countries will be favoured in the
selection process (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Re-
public, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Nether-
lands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Turkey). A couple of
self funded participants may also be accepted depend-

tion (EMBO)
Principal Organiser: Professor Vincent Moulton (Uni-
versity of East Anglia)
Organisers: Dr Brent Emerson (University of East An-
glia), Professor Daniel Huson (Tuebingen University)
and Professor Mike Steel (University of Canterbury)
Theme of Workshop: Phylogenetic trees and networks
are central to modern molecular evolutionary biology,
with applications ranging from the origin of viruses (e.g.
HIV, inﬂuenza) to modelling plant and animal radia-
tions. As biologists attempt to reconstruct larger slices
of the tree of life’ using increasingly complex data, and
incorporating more accurate models of molecular evo-
lution, mathematics (and its sister ﬁelds, statistics and
computer science) is increasingly being seen as an es-
sential tool.
This workshop will showcase some of the recent achieve-
ments, challenges and new problems that arise in us-
ing mathematical approaches to understand molecular
evolution. Topics covered will include: phylogenomics,
molecular epidemiology, genetic biodiversity and phy-
logeography, processes of reticulate evolution (such as
horizontal gene transfer), haplotype mapping by per-
fect phylogeny, population genetics in phylogeny, and
metagenomics.
In addition this workshop will launch (and set the
agenda for) a 4-month workshop of collaboration and
research at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathemati-
cal Sciences in a program on Phylogenetics, which will
bring mathematicians and biologists together to de-
velop new approaches in molecular phylogenetics.
Invited Speakers: J Felsenstein (Washington), O Gas-
cuel (LIRMM), J Hein (Oxford), J Kim (Pennsylvania),

Please ﬁnd below and attached an invitation to attend
a phd course in evolutionary theory and applications
to held at the Molslaboratory, 40 km north of Aarhus.
Volker Loeschcke, Professor in Evolutionary Genetics
(Dept. of Biological Sciences, Section for Ecology and
Genetics, Univ. of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark)
Ph.D. course: Evolutionary theory and its applications
Aim: The power of evolutionary approaches to very
diﬀerent disciplines from economy over philosophy to
medicine is getting increasing attention among scien-
tists while at the same time the validity of evolutionary
explanations concerning the origin of life and the forces
that shape its diversity has been under attack - a sig-
niﬁcant proportion of the populations of western (and
other) countries is not satisﬁed by the answers that bi-
ologists provide and feel comfortable with non-scientiﬁc
based ideas as intelligent design or creationism. On this
background, it is timely to improve the knowledge on
evolutionary concepts and the evolutionary approach
among students in biology and other disciplines with
interest in evolutionary thinking. Thus we invite PhD
students in biology and related ﬁelds to participate in a
course that provides the opportunity to refresh knowl-
edge on central elements in evolutionary theory and to
discuss the concept of evolution in a broad perspec-
tive. The course shall familiarize the participants with
?thinking evolution? and encourage them to include
this thinking in reﬂection on their own project.
Prerequisites: Reading of the following literature:

Investigating the Evolution of Plant Form: Conceptual
Integration from the Molecular to the Ecological
A Molecular and Organismic Research in Plant History
(MORPH) sponsored minicourse
December 14th - 16th, 2007 at the University of Col-
orado, Boulder
This intensive minicourse and workshop will provide
an opportunity for a select group of doctoral students
and distinguished investigators in plant evolutionary
developmental biology to interact. The goal will be
to address current methodological and conceptual hur-
dles associated with the study of the evolution of plant
form. In particular, participants will focus on the inte-
gration of developmental information across molecular,
organismic, and ecological levels of plant biology. In
addition to presentations by the faculty, each student
will outline critical issues associated with his/her own
evolutionary developmental research for discussion by
all participants.
Faculty include: Scott Armbruster Spencer Barrett
Peter Crane Pamela Diggle Michael Donoghue Peter
Endress William Friedman Larry Huﬀord Vivian Irish
Amy Litt Michael Purugganan
The deadline for application is September 1, 2007.
MORPH will cover all reasonable costs (registration, air
fare, hotel accommodations, and meals) for successful
applicants.

ESF sponsored exploratory workshop on
Ecological genetics: understanding the functional con-
sequences of natural variation in adaptation
Vienna 15.-16.9. 2007 Note: this is immediately after
the European Drosophila Research Conference ( http:/-
/www.imp.ac.at/EDRC2007/ )
Synopsis
It is well established that natural populations harbor
huge amounts of molecular variation. The neutral the-
ory of molecular evolution suggested that the eﬀect of
most of mutations is so small that they can be con-
sidered as neutral. Recent evidence, however, demon-
strated that a large proportion of natural variation
seems to be involved in adaptation to the environment.
Population genetics has developed powerful tools to
identify genes under selection, but the functional vali-
dation of such ecologically important variants requires
new functional approaches suitable to measure eﬀects
that are important in the wild, but diﬃcult to score in
the laboratory. Conversely, there is increasing evidence
that natural variation in structural or regulatory geneshave major eﬀects, which were only recognized through
the comparison of diﬀerent naturally occurring variants.
This workshop provides a platform for both functional
biologists and population geneticists with the aim to
develop concepts and new tools to study the functional
consequences of natural variation, in particular in the
context of ecology.
The invited speakers cover a broad range of topics and
approaches, ranging from theoretical population genet-
ics and quantitative genetics to developmental biology.
The impact of environmental and genetic variation on
phenotypic traits will be covered. It will be discussed
how the knowledge of well-studied model organisms,
such as D. melanogaster, yeast and A. thaliana, can be
extended to less studied organisms.

The workshop will be open to a limited number of
additional participants, in particular functional biolo-
gists are encouraged to participate. Applications in-
cluding CV and motivation statement should be sent
to jmg@i122server.vu-wien.ac.at until June, 19th.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.July 1, 2007 EvolDir 85
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
