symposium at Asilomar, CA (USA) 13-15 Aug 2014
We are nearing the 50th anniversary of one of the most
important books in evolutionary biology: The Genetics
of Colonizing Species (1965) edited by Herbert Baker
and G. Ledyard Stebbins. This classic volume was
based on a symposium at Asilomar, California in 1964
and initiated the study of the genetics and evolution of
invasive species. To revisit the historical legacy of the
meeting and book, we are pleased to announce a sym-
posium at Asilomar from August 13-15, 2014. The sym-
posium will enjoy support from Wiley-Blackwell Pub-
lishers, and associated original papers will appear in a
Special Issue of Molecular Ecology in 2015. The sym-
posium proceedings (including the popular question-
answer transcripts of the original) will also be published
in 2015 as a book to mark the 50th anniversary of the
original volume.
Please join us for this special event! DATES: Au-gust 13-15, 2014 LOCATION: Asilomar Conference
Grounds (http://www.visitasilomar.com/)
REGISTRATION: Details at http://invasion-
genetics.eventbrite.com Contributed posters will
be welcomed - title submission will open June 1, 2014.
SPEAKERS/AUTHORS: We have conrmed a broad

CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT
Livestock Genomic Resources in a Changing World
Cardi University, 17th - 19th of June, 2014
The ESF Genomic Resources Program is holding its -
nal meeting at Cardi University, UK. The meeting will
focus on Livestock conservation practice in a changing
world, aiming at understanding rapid changes in conser-
vation practices in light of policy developments, climate
change and diversifying market demands. The confer-
ence will focus on four themes arranged in symposia
aiming to:
1) redene the role of genome data in livestock conser-
vation and prioritisation
2) identify improved and more integrative analysis
methods for livestock genomic, environmental and
socio-economic data
3) assess genomic resources for minority livestock
species and breeds -where are we and what do we need?
4) horizon-scan for the twenty most important problems
we need to overcome for eective livestock resource con-
servation during the next decade.
The meeting will feature internationally renowned
speakers in each Symposium but we especially want
to encourage Genomics Resources-funded students and
postdocs to contribute posters and talks in the ample
free sessions. Free sessions may include talks of rel-
evance to the Symposium preceding it, but not neces-
sarily. An Integration Activity at the end of the confer-
ence and the symposium on Horizon Scanning will fo-
cus on the production of a review article that addresses
the main upcoming challenges in livestock genomic re-
sources conservation. All participants will be invited to
contribute to this article, which will be a major output
from the meeting and which we hope work as a guide-
line for policy and strategy development, and which will
be publish in a major international journal.

Jul14-16 SlotsAvailable
Attention! Only few slots still available! Due to vari-
ous requests, even though the deadline for registration
and abstract submission has already passed, we will ll
additional slots on a rst-come, rst-serve basis. So if
you are interested to attend our meeting or if you know
someone who might be, please spread the word!!!
I herewith want to announce the 1st Greifswald Phy-
logenetics Meeting, which will be held in Greifswald
(north eastern Germany) from the 14th till the 16th of
July 2014.
Registration is now open and the deadline (both for
registration as well as for abstract submission) has been
postponed due to various requests. There are still a few
free slots, so please register asap!
Our conference poster can be found here: http:/-

2014/poster-gpm-2014.pdf Feel free to print it and for-
ward it to anybody who might be interested! For
more details, please visit the conference website:
http://stubber.math-inf.uni-greifswald.de/ ~ spillner/-
gpm-2014/gpm-2014.html This meeting will have a
particular focus on mathematical (e.g. graph theoreti-
cal, combinatorial, probabilistic and algebraic) aspects
of evolutionary tree or network reconstruction, but it
will also bring together scientists from dierent disci-
plines in order to provide the opportunity of close col-
laboration.
Scope:
Phylogenetics is an interdisciplinary research area that
aims at reconstructing the evolutionary history of bi-
ological systems such as, for example, collections of
species, populations or groups of bio-molecules. To
achieve this, biologists work closely together with math-
ematicians and computer scientists. The conference will
provide researchers from all three involved disciplines
an opportunity to present their recent work and ex-
change ideas.
Location: Greifswald is a beautiful little town located
directly at the Baltic Sea in close proximity to the fa-
mous islands R ugen and Usedom. Greifswald university
was founded in 1496 and has therefore a long tradition
and history. Being a former Hanse town, Greifswald is
famous for its historic market square, its cathedral andthe museum harbor. Other famous towns like Stralsund
with the Oceaneum or the world cultural heritage city
of Wismar are nearby, as well as the city of Rostock
with its newly established Darwineum. The region is a
holiday region but not too crowded by tourists. In July
the weather is most likely to be great and we hope that
if you can come to our meeting, you will nd the time
to stay longer and enjoy this unique area. There is a
direct and regular train connection to and from Berlin,
and the nearest international airports are Hamburg and
Berlin.
Please note that the meeting starts early on the 14th
with one of our highlight talks and ends in the evening
of the 16th with another highlight talk - so if possible,
please plan your stay from the 13th till the 17th of July.
The registration fee is 150 Euros (100 Euros for stu-
dents).

*We are looking for researchers of all kinds to present
research on:* -insect dispersal -dispersal and metacom-
munity dynamics -dispersal and microcosms -or other
big questions about dispersal
*We will be showcasing research on these topics at our
symposium entitled:*
*A hitchhikers guide to the microcosmos: The chal-
lenges of dispersal*
*Conference: Entomological Society of America 2014 *
*Location: Portland, Oregon* *Date (tentative): 19 of
November 2014*
The symposium will consist of a combination of oral and
poster presentations. All presentations will be given
priority based on order of submission. The Ent. Soc.
of America may be able to provide a limited amount of
funding to one or a few symposium participants.
Speakers at the symposium will be Dr. Ola Finke and
Dr. Karl Cottenie among others. *A further descrip-
tion of the symposium is here:* The main topic of dis-
cussion will be insect dispersal. We intend to emphasize
dispersal in the context of microcosm ecosystems (e.g.
bromeliad, tree hole, ephemeral pond) and their meta-
community. Since this is quite a specic topic, we will
be including broader talks about insect dispersal that
can be linked back to a discussion of microcosm ecosys-
tems. We believe that dispersal is often discussed amor-
phously despite being hugely important for determining
biological patterns. The goal of this symposium is to
identify how the use of microcosms as model systems
can bring clarity and precision to our understanding of
dispersal.

PuertoRico SMBE Jun8-12
PosterJudges
Are any of you graduate students or postdocs who plan
to attend the SMBE (Society of Molecular Biology and
Evolution) meetings in San Juan, Puerto Rico in June?
I have been assigned the job of coordinating the judg-
ing of posters in the poster sessions. I need to recruit
over 40 grad students or postdocs to be judges.
Each person will need to evaluate about 30-40 posters
in all. If you yourself have a poster, you can still be
a judge. We will of course not ask you to judge your
own poster, and we will not ask you to judge posters in
the same session as your poster, so that you are able to
\stand" your poster without distractions.
Posters will be evaluated on a 5-point scale, and the
highest-rated ones from each session will be asked to
make their poster available for a second round of judg-
ing. A lot of the details remain to be worked out.
Some further details wil be found at this web page:
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/posters.html I
hope that you will consider helping with this. If you
are willing, please send me an email saying so. If you
are not able to do this, please bring his request to the
attention of graduate students or postdocs who may
not have seen his message. We hope to have judges
with a wide diversity of elds and skills.

PhylogeneticComparativeMethods
Nov11-15
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the upcoming conference
entitled \Modern Phylogenetic Comparative Methods
and their Application in Evolutionary Biology", which
will take place in Seville (Spain) from the 11th-15th
November 2014.
Overview: Phylogenetic comparative methods are now
widely used in very diverse elds of evolutionary biol-
ogy to make robust inferences from interspecic data
and phylogenies. Currently, we witness a rapid our-
ishing of the phylogenetic toolbox allowing researchers
to tackle diverse questions concerning the evolution ofJune 1, 2014 EvolDir 9
species and their traits. The conference aims at provid-
ing a bouquet of overviews on the most recent develop-
ments by the most prominent experts of the compara-
tive methodology, and also at attracting a wide range of
contributions from dierent elds of evolutionary biol-
ogy to demonstrate how the phylogenetic comparative
approach can be used to address an ample array of bi-
ological questions in dierent taxa.
The list of invited speakers: Joe Felsenstein - Uni-
versity of Washington, USA (to be conrmed) Robert
P. Freckleton -University of Sheeld, UK Thomas F.
Hansen - University of Oslo, Norway Charles L. Nunn -
Duke University, USA Emmanuel Paradis - Institut de
Recherche pour le D eveloppement, France Liam Revell
- University of Massachusetts, USA
We welcome proposals for talks and posters on any as-
pect of the application of the phylogenetic comparative
methodology that is relevant for making evolutionary
inferences. The deadline for applications is the 1st of
September.
Beside the scientic program, we also organise social
events to obtain a unique cultural experience from An-
dalusia.

extendedDeadline
The XXXIII Congress of the Willi Hennig Society will
be held in Trento, Italy, from the 6th to the 10th of
July 2014.
WHO. The Willi Hennig Society promotes studies in
Phylogenetic Systematics. When rst expressed by
Hennig in his works, the idea that only monophyletic
groups of organisms, as evolutionarily entities, should
be recognized and formally named, caused hot con-
troversy but it is now established as the standard
approach to modern systematics. The Society pub-
lishes Cladistics, one of the most prestigious interna-
tional scientic journal dedicated to phylogenetic sys-
tematics. Organizers: Massimo Bernardi, MUSE (mas-
simo.bernardi@muse.it), Alessandro Minelli, Univer-
sity of Padova (alessandro.minelli@unipd.it), and Omar
Rota-Stabelli, FEM (omar.rota@fmach.it).
WHAT. For the rst time in its history the WHS or-
ganizes its annual congress in Italy. MUSE and the
city of Trento are proud to host this important interna-
tional event. The program will be developed through a
series of sessions and symposia during which various is-
sues related to phylogenetic analysis will be addressed:
from systematics to biogeography to macroevolution-
ary analysis of individual clades. The congress will also
give particular emphasis to the key topics of research
in this eld in Italy. Participants will have the possi-
bility to visit the exhibition halls of the new museum
at any time during the congress. Visits or research in
the museum's collections will be possible following ap-
pointment (massimo.bernardi@muse.it).
WHERE. All scientic sessions will be held in the con-
ference hall G. Canestrini of MUSE in Trento, NE Italy,
Corso del Lavoro e della Scienza, 3.
WHEN. The registration desk will open in the evening
of July 6th, when congress participants will be invited
to a welcome party. The last session will be held on the
10th of July.

PhD Position in Rennes, France
The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the dependence of
the dynamics of populations of the lesser horseshoe bat
vis- a-vis the quality of the environment, in order to bet-
ter understand the overall dynamics of the species and
to make recommendations in terms of forest manage-ment. The research area being located at the current
northern limit of the range of the species, which tends
to progress because of global warming, particular at-
tention will be paid to correlations between traits (dis-
persal, reproduction) to test the hypothesis that these
correlations are modied close to distribution margins,
particularly during recolonization dynamics.
Methodological approaches considered include (1) the
use of georeferenced databases, (2) non-invasive genetic
approaches, (3) the development and use of capture-
mark-recapture models for estimating dispersal rates,
survival, recruitment with noninvasive genetic data,
and (4) statistical analysis using generalized linear
models.
The candidate should have (or at least be willing to
develop) skills in population dynamics and population
genetics, landscape ecology, management / treatment
of geo-referenced databases, programming (via the R
program) and, this is very important, have good writ-
ing skills (in both French and English languages).

FishSexEvolution
PhD Position in Rennes, France
A PhD position is available on the \Evolution
of Sex Determining genes in Fishes" in Rennes
at the INRA Fish Genomics laboratory (http://-
www6.rennes.inra.fr/lpgp eng/).
Sexual reproduction is one of the most highly conserved
processes in evolution and implicates many elds of
biology but also animal and plant breeding and hu-
man health and society. The genetic and cell biological
mechanisms making the decision whether the undier-
entiated gonad of the embryo develops either towards
male or female are manifold and quite dierent. Sex16 EvolDir June 1, 2014
determining (SD) mechanism range from environmen-
tal to simple or complex genetic mechanisms and have
evolved obviously repeatedly and independently. Fish
are uniquely suited to study the evolution of sex de-
termination and SD genes. This project aims at the
characterization of the evolution of master sex deter-
mining genes in sh with a focus on a limited number
of species from one sh family.
This project has then two major objectives: (1) to
screen for potential sex determining genes in a few
sh species; (2) to demonstrate the role of one iden-
tied gene as a master sex determinant in one selected
species. To address these questions, this project will
be based on preliminary results from our group reveal-
ing potential new sex determining genes in a few sh
species. These candidate genes will be used to identify
more precisely the sex determining locus and their evo-
lution in these species. Candidate genes will be evalu-
ated by transcript proling and nally a selection of one
candidate gene will be taken for functional character-
ization using additive transgenesis and gene knockout
approaches.
This project will make use of many dierent method-
ological approaches including high throughput sequenc-
ing, in silico analysis of these sequences (bioinformat-
ics, genetics, genomics) and the development of molec-
ular studies on the evolution of the sequences identied
within the project i.e., conservation / evolution of sex
determining genes within dierent taxa (species, genus,
family ...). This project will also need the development
of new animal models genetically modied in order to
prove the functionality of one candidate gene as a mas-
ter sex determining gene in one sh species.
The PhD candidate should have skills in molecular biol-
ogy and / or evolution biology and / or developmental
biology. Basic biological knowledge needed on genetics
and interest for in silico analysis (bio informatics).
Starting date: october 2014
Admission: The funding of this PhD is already secured
but candidates need to go through a competitive ad-
mission process (see http://www.vas.univ-rennes1.fr/-

AvianBehaviouralEvol
3 PhD opportunities available in the Avian Behavioural
Ecology research group at Macquarie University, Syd-
ney, Australia for a start from mid to late 2014.
Project 1: Adapting to a foreign climate: the estab-
lishment of the house sparrow in Australia and New
Zealand
The house sparrow (*Passer domesticus*) was intro-
duced into Australia and New Zealand in the 1860's and
has since become well established across a broad range
of climates in both countries. This project will take ad-
vantage of this ^ aexperimental' introduction to focus on
behavioural and physiological adaptations to dierent
climates through a eld-based comparative approach.
This research will complement our existing work on re-
lated questions in endemic Australian species and will
provide insight into the capacity of avian species to
adapt to changing climates.This project will involve long periods of eld-work at a
variety of eld sites in Australia and New Zealand along
with a range of behavioural, molecular and physiologi-
cal assays. The project will involve collaboration with
other groups throughout Australia and New Zealand.
Project 2: The ecology and evolution of Australian
birds in relation to climate
The climate of much of the central part of Australia is
harsh and unpredictable with rainfall being both spa-
tially and temporally highly variable. This project will
use a variety of approaches to gain insight into the
way in which this climate has shaped the life-history,
morphology and behaviour of Australia's unique avi-
fauna. The research will build a dataset characterising
key traits in Australia's birds, and utilise extensive and
publically available datasets on climate, environment
and biodiversity. Analyses will utilise GIS techniques
and require skills in both modelling and statistics in R
and ArcGIS.
The project will involve collaboration with Dr's Beau-
mont and Gallagher (also at Macquarie). The work
will be primarily desk-based and experience in spatial
analysis and macroecology is required.
Project 3: The behavioural ecology of the chirruping
wedgebill
The chirruping wedgebill (*Psophodes cristatus) is en-
demic *to the arid zone of Eastern Australia and has yet
to be the focus of any behavioural study. This project
will begin the study of this species in an attempt to
characterise the behavioural ecology of the species to
complement our recent work on three other species liv-
ing in the same environment. We are particularly in-
terested in the mating system, social behaviour and the
characteristic acoustic behaviour for which the species
was named. This research will require long periods of
eldwork at the remote Fowlers Gap research station in
arid Australia and will also focus on bioacoustics and
the molecular determination of parentage. This project
will be conducted in collaboration with Dr Andy Rus-
sell at the University of Exeter, UK.
Two Macquarie University Excellence in Research
Scholarships have already been assigned to these
projects, one scholarship is open to all international
candidates, and one scholarship is available only to res-
idents from Australia or New Zealand. Successful can-
didates for the third position will be assisted in ap-
plying for other sources of funding. International can-
didates are welcome to apply for any of the projects
listed above.

Application Deadline: Friday 30 May 2014
Project description:
Many organisms are currently responding to climate
changes with dramatic range shifts involving evolution-
ary responses. Among the organisms most strongly af-
fected by changing climates are small, exothermic an-
imals such as insects, which can evolve rapidly and
quickly disperse into available niches, often posing new
threats to food security (as crop or stored-food pests),
human and animal welfare (as disease vectors), and af-
fecting overall ecosystem function.
The mechanisms of niche evolution and range shift un-
der rapidly changing climates remain poorly under-
stood. In this PhD project, the student will investi-
gate a number of hypothetical evolutionary trajectories
that underlie rapid shifts in resource use and climatic
tolerances observed during range expansions.
Using experimental evolution and crossing experiments
in a captive-bred colony of seed beetles (Coleoptera:
Bruchidae, a global stored-crop pest), combined with
in silico modeling approaches, the student will investi-
gate conditions producing alternative evolutionary sce-
narios, and the quantitative genetic/genomic basis of
niche divergence under each scenario. Project outputs
will inform management of evolving pest species, and
will contribute to evolutionary theory. The student is
expected to contribute ideas to the development of the
project, which will be customized to reect individual
student background and research interests.
We will provide training in experimental evolution,

UEastAnglia Polyploidy and
Immunity
****Closing date 31st May 2014****
Ancient whole genome duplications (WGDs) and the
additional genetic resources resulting from them have
played major roles in the evolution many eukaryotes. In
vertebrates, there is strong evidence that two rounds
of ancient WGD were followed by a third additional
WGD in the teleost shes - the sh specic genome
duplication (FSGD). The role that WGD plays in the
evolutionary success of recipient taxa and lineages has
been hotly debated for many decades. However, while
progress has been made in understanding the origins
and mechanisms of the formation of polyploids in many
groups, less attention has been devoted to the advan-
tages and/or disadvantages of being a polyploid.
This PhD project will investigate two related facets of
individual tness - immune gene diversity (the MHC)
and macroparasite burden, in a group of neotropi-
cal catshes (the Corydoradinae) that have undergone
multiple WGDs, ranging from ancient paleopolyploid
events ( ~40 mya) to relatively recent duplications ( ~1-2
mya). The Corydoradinae are widely over South Amer-
ica and comprise more than 170 described species di-
vided into 9 lineages. The group demonstrate multiple
genome duplication events (polyploidy) and also exhibit
complex mimetic colour pattern relationships1.
Using sympatric communities of species (which should
theoretically be exposed to the same parasites) that
vary in ploidy level, this project will: 1) quantify im-
mune gene diversity in taxa that range from diploid to
polyploid; (2) quantify macroparasite burdens in mul-
tiple sympatric communities consisting of diploid and
polyploid species (3) investigate the role of additional
host-specic factors that may inuence macroparasite
burdens such as size, age, diet and population demo-
graphics.
The successful applicant join the group of Dr Martin
Taylor and will receive training in next generation se-
quencing and associated bioinformatic analysis as well
as more traditional techniques such as parasitology.
There will also be opportunities for conducting eld-
work in South America with Brazilian collaborators.

UGlasgow VirusEvolution
PhD Studentship, University of Glasgow
A genomic approach to uncovering the mechanisms
driving host restriction and virulence in louping ill virus
Why particular viruses are able to infect and to cause
disease in some host species but not others are funda-
mental questions that are critical for controlling viral
pathogens. This project aims to uncocver the molec-
ular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying host re-
striction and virulence of louping-ill virus (LIV), one
of several closely related tick-borne aviviruses in Eu-
rope that exhibit high phenotyopic variability: whereas
LIV mainly causes disease in British sheep and grouse,
other LIV strains and related viruses elsewhere in Eu-
rope tend to aect other livestock species or human
hosts. Using a combination of whole genome sequenc-
ing, bioinformatics, in vitro experiments and reverse
genetics the project aims to 1) examine the genome-
wide diversity and evolutionary history of LIV across
its current range; 2) compare the ability of dierent
LIV strains and related virus species for in vitro growth
in a range of host species; 3) to experimentally ver-
ify putative genotype -phenotype relationships through
a reverse genetics system. Through the application of
powerful new technologies and analytic approaches, theproject will provide novel insights about the biology of a
signicant animal pathogen in the UK and advance our
general understanding of the factors governing virus-
host interactions.
This exciting studentship opportunity will draw on ex-
pertise from academics within the University of Glas-
gow and The Moredun Research Institute. The student
will spend an equal percentage of their time at both lo-
cations.
BBSRC WestBio DTP studentships will follow a 4-
year PhD model. The nancial package will include
a 4-year stipend, approved University of Glasgow fees
and a consumables budget per annum. The success-
ful student will participate in the robust MVLS Col-
lege skills training programme throughout their studies.

UOslo AvianSpermEvolution
A 4 year PhD position is available at the Natural
history Museum (NHM), University of Oslo (http://-

The subject of the PhD project is \Evolution of sperm
form and function in passerine birds". Passerine birds,
and especially the oscine passerines or songbirds, are
highly diversied in sexual traits, including their sperm
cells. Recent research has documented that post-
copulatory sexual selection, mediated by female promis-
cuity (extrapair copulations), shape sperm phenotypes
and lead to longer and/or faster-swimming sperm over
evolutionary time scales. The project will examine
in more detail how particular sperm structures, espe-
cially the size and shape of the sperm head, which con-
tains the acrosome and the nucleus, vary in response to
sexual selection across the passerine phylogeny. The
project will also study how variation in sperm phe-
notypes among males in a population is inuenced by
current selection pressures. NHM holds a large collec-
tion of passerine sperm samples, which will be the main
source material for analysis, using high-resolution light
and electron microscopy. There will also be some eld
work in Norway and abroad for collecting additional
sperm samples.
We seek a person with strong motivation and ability
to dene his/her own research questions. The candi-

and should have good knowledge in avian systematics
and practical experience with ornithological eld work.

The subject of the PhD project is \Functional ge-
nomics of sperm phenotypes and cryptic female choice
in passerine birds". In many passerine bird species, fe-
males copulate frequently with extra-pair mates, which
implies that sperm from dierent males compete for the
same set of ova and that there might be sperm-female
interactions aecting the outcome of sperm competi-
tion. This project takes a molecular approach to deepen
our understanding of the possible mechanisms involved
in this form of sexual selection at the gamete level.
The project has two main goals, a) nding molecular
markers or genes associated with sperm performance
traits, b) test if females obtain good or compatible genes
through extrapair mating, in particular immune genes
at the Major Histocompatibility Complex. The project
will adopt next-generation sequencing approaches for
several analyses, and utilize a large sample of already-
collected DNA from families of a few intensively stud-
ied species (e.g. willow warblers, bluethroats and barn
swallows). There will be little or no eld work but ex-

We seek a person with strong motivation and ability to
dene his/her own research questions. The candidate
must have wide interests in molecular ecology/genetics
and evolutionary biology, and good practical, hands-on

ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=50903&LID=1268 Since
the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, 71
out of 113 endemic bird species there have become
extinct, and 32 are currently endangered or threatened.
Mosquito-vectored avian malaria and pox, which were
co-introduced with non-native mosquito species, are
primary obstacles to conservation and restoration
eorts of endemic forest avifauna [1]. The mosquito
Culex quinquefasciatus is the dominant vector of the
pathogens in Hawaiian bird populations.
One promising approach for mosquito control is RIDL
(Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) [2]
uses transgenic technology to engineer a lethal trait
in larvae, which is repressible by provision of tetra-cycline in the larval water to allow rearing in captiv-
ity. As recently shown against the dengue virus vec-
tor mosquito, Aedes aegypti, sustained releases of male
RIDL mosquitoes leads to substantial reduction of the
target population [3], as progeny die as larvae in the
absence of the chemical antidote in the eld. Such
mosquitoes are therefore genetically sterile. A vari-
ant of RIDL engineers repressible female death [4-7],
to allow production of male-only cohorts of mosquitoes
(males do not bite or vector disease). RIDL imple-
mentation is rmly grounded in years of experience
with radiation-sterilised insects (the Sterile Insect Tech-
nique) while providing major improvements through
the application of modern genetics.
This studentship project will seek to extend RIDL to
C. quinquefasciatus. The student will generate trans-
formed strains with modular constructs appropriate for
function in Culex. Those that show a suitable RIDL
phenotype will undergo assessment of biological perfor-
mance parameters such as mating competitiveness and
longevity in large cages. Success in the application of
RIDL against this mosquito would represent the rst
use of transgenic animals for species conservation.
We anticipate that the bulk of the lab work will be
conducted at The Pirbright Institute; and depending
on progress, the project may involve lab and/or eld
work in Hawaii.

sity of Queensland. Our group uses genomic and quan-
titative genetic approaches to understand the evolution
of sex dierences and is currently focused on the evolu-
tion of gene expression. We use both model and non-
model Drosophila species and have recently developed
signicant genomic resources for Drosophila serrata in-
cluding de novo genome and transcriptome assemblies,
a panel of 100 re-sequenced lines and multiple sets of
evolving populations. Projects will leverage these re-
sources to develop innovative approaches to identify the
genomic targets of sex-specic natural and sexual selec-
tion.
Prior training in the following areas is highly desirable
but not essential: quantitative or population genetics,
bioinformatics, genomics or evolutionary biology.

EvolutionInsectDecomposers
We are inviting applications for a PhD studentship to
investigate how evolutionary relationships and the rela-
tive abundance of insect decomposers aect ecosystem
function.
Project description: Around the world, human activi-
ties are causing the collapse of populations and species,
and this has triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis.30 EvolDir June 1, 2014
Rare species are often the rst to disappear, and a crit-
ical issue in modern ecology is whether common species
insure against the loss of functions supported by rare
species. This issue is particularly important in species-
rich ecosystems such as tropical rainforests where large
numbers of rare species suggest high functional redun-
dancy. Using tropical epiphytes as natural microcosms,
the PhD student will test the relationship between in-
vertebrate biodiversity and ecosystem function via nu-
trient stoichiometry, that is, the relationship between
the relative quantities of nutrients cycling through the
epiphytes. The student will spend their rst year com-
pleting preliminary data collection at the Eden Project
in Cornwall (http://www.edenproject.com/). Studies
in the second and third years, of the evolutionary rela-
tionships between insect decomposers and their eects
on nutrient cycling, will be completed as part of the
Royal Society's South East Asia Rainforest Research
Programme (SEARRP). During this time the student
will be based at Danum Valley Field Centre - the lead-
ing rainforest research centre in the Old World tropics.
(http://www.searrp.org/danum-valley/).
The Eden Project is an internationally renowned ed-
ucational charity and social enterprise containing the
largest indoor rainforest in the world. Having spent
one year based at the Eden Project learning eld tech-
niques in the rainforest biome, the student will con-
tinue their eldwork at the Danum Valley Field Centre
in Borneo. Working in partnership with Danum Valley
Field Centre and with the Eden Project will provide
the PhD candidate with an unparalleled student expe-
rience. First, they will be prepared for overseas eld-
work within the safety of an indoor rainforest; secondly,
working with sta from an internationally renowned re-
search centre and tourist attraction will provide unique
benets not only in terms of the student experience but
for the longer term employability of the student.
Details of the supervisory team: Dr Farnon Ellwood
is a member of the Royal Society's SEARRP and is
highly experienced in studying invertebrate biodiver-
sity in the rainforest of Danum Valley in Borneo. Dr
Neil Willey's expertise includes plant physiology and
nutrient cycling. Dr Pete Maxeld's scientic inter-
ests are linked with developing a mechanistic under-
standing of carbon storage and carbon ow pathways in
both natural and experimentally manipulated ecosys-
tems. Dr Sam Bonnett's expertise covers soil micro-
bial functional diversity involving enzyme kinetic as-
says, greenhouse gas production and substrate-induced
respiration assays (MicroResp(tm)). Dr Don Murray,
based at the Eden Project, has expertise in epiphyte
population dynamics and tropical taxonomy specialis-
ing on epiphytes.Entry requirements: Applicants must have obtained, or
be about to obtain, a First or Upper Second Class UK
Honours degree, or the equivalent qualications gained
outside the UK, in Biological Sciences or other relevant
subject.
The studentship is only available to UK and other EU
nationals.

EvolutionEcologyAmbrosiaBeetles
We are seeking a PhD candidate to undertake research
on the diversity, ecology and evolution of wood-boring,
fungus-cultivating ambrosia beetles in Australia. This
role is based at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Envi-
ronment, University of Western Sydney, and is linked
to a project co-funded by the Australian Biological Re-
sources Study.
Bark and wood-boring beetles have been recognised as
a signicant challenge to forests internationally, in par-
ticular as this group includes many invasives, some of
which can transmit devastating tree pathogens.
Australia is home to a signicant and unique diversity
of ambrosia beetles, including the world's only docu-
mented eusocial beetle as well as several species that
inhabit living trees (a more derived characteristic that
involves dealing with tree responses without killing a
tree), yet their overall diversity and evolutionary ecol-
ogy remains unknown. Understanding the group's sys-
tematics, co-evolution with microbes, host-tree associ-
ations and community dynamics, in the context of a
changing climate and potentially vulnerable plantation
and native timber assets in Australia is the overarching
goal of the project.
The successful PhD candidate will undertake a re-
search program in alignment with our project to in-
vestigate the diversity and ecology of Australian am-
brosia beetles and their fascinating interactions with
microbial symbionts. The approach will involve eld
surveys, microbial assays, high-tech morphological sys-June 1, 2014 EvolDir 31
tematics, landscape genetic analyses and/or phyloge-
netics. There will be opportunities for professional de-
velopment, travel and interaction with an international
team of researchers (including collaborators from Uni-
versity of Florida, University of Pretoria, and Univer-
sity of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna).
The student will be supervised by Dr Markus Riegler
and Dr Shannon Smith and will benet from access
to exceptional entomological and molecular facilities at
the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at the
University of Western Sydney. The candidate will also
have a strong interdisciplinary team at the HIE avail-
able for consultation, including experts in plant, fungal
and insect science, microbial ecology and environmental
genomics.
CRITERIA: The successful applicant should: - demon-
strate excellent academic performance related to the
research proposed. - hold qualications and experience
equal to an Australian First Class Bachelor Honours
degree, Research Masters, or Masters coursework de-
gree with greater than 25% research. - be enthusiastic
and highly motivated to undertake further study at an
advanced level. - have a background including at least
one of molecular ecology, microbiology and entomology
and have experience and knowledge or familiarity in
DNA-based or other taxonomic techniques.
As the project will involve eldwork candidates must
demonstrate the ability to organise and work indepen-
dently. International applicants must also demonstrate
a high level of prociency in English.
The PhD candidate is anticipated to commence in mid
to late 2014.
WHAT DOES THE SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDE? The
scholarship recipient will receive a tax free stipend of
$30,392 per annum and a funded place in the doctoral
degree (for domestic students) while enrolment fees may
be waved for international students with a strong track
record. Further funding is available for project costs
and conference travel.

Zurich EvolutionaryEcology
The Department of Aquatic Ecology at EAWAG seeks
to recruit a: PhD student in Evolutionary Ecology
The PhD student will be funded by a Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation grant, entitled \The eco-
evolutionary dynamics of community assembly in
aquatic ecosystems". The aim of the project is to
understand how ecological and evolutionary processes
jointly drive community assembly in aquatic ecosys-
tems. The project involves a combination large-scaleexperiments that manipulate the ecological and evolu-
tionary diversity of food webs under contrasting envi-
ronmental conditions, as well as the analysis of existing
long-term datasets of plankton biodiversity dynamics
in freshwater lakes. The project is broadly focused on
aquatic food webs, including microbial, phytoplankton,
zooplankton, and sh communities. Ultimately, the re-
search addresses fundamental links between the ecology
and evolution of food webs and the physical environ-
ment and biogeochemistry of ecosystems.
We are looking for a self-directed and motivated stu-
dent with a broad interest in ecology, evolution, and/or
ecosystem science. Ideally, the student will be inter-
ested in eldwork, food-web experiments, analysis of
biodiversity datasets, and molecular ecology.
Eawag is an international research institute, and is
closely aliated with top universities that grant PhD
degrees, such as ETH-Zurich. The working language of
the department is English. We oer a stimulating re-
search environment in the Aquatic Ecology department,
which has locations in D ubendorf (near Zurich) and
Kastanienbaum (near Lucerne). Located on the shores
of Lake Lucerne, Eawag's Center for Ecology, Evolution
& Biogeochemistry (CEEB: http://www.eawag.ch/-
forschung/cc/ceeb/index EN ) is a strong nucleus of
Eawag research groups aimed at integrating evolution-
ary biology, community ecology, and ecosystem science.
At both locations, the student will interact with a di-
verse range of researchers studying community ecology,
evolutionary biology, ecological genetics, ecosystem sci-
ence, and applied environmental science. The project
will also involve collaborations between researchers at
Eawag (Dr. Blake Matthews, Dr. Helmut B urgmann)
and the University of Geneva (Dr. Bas Ibelings)
The starting date for the PhD student is exible, but a
starting date in 2014 is preferred. The PhD program at
ETH-Zurich generally lasts three years. Applications
should include a cover letter, a curriculum vita, and
three references. Copies of prior publications or the-
ses will also be considered if made available via PDF.

to 2 weeks) or longer exchanges (up to 3 months) to fos-
ter scientic interactions between institutions from dif-
ferent countries. The planned visits should be directly
relevant to the scope of the ConGenOmics network pro-
gramme, which include topics such as:
- Development and transfer of genomic knowledge and
approaches in a conservation context
- Experimental study of the (genomic) mechanisms be-
hind important biological processes of relevance for con-
servation
- Application and development of data handling and
processing strategies in conservation genomics- Application of community and metagenomics in con-
servation biological context
After assessment of scientic merit and relevance to the
ConGenOmics network, priority will be given to appli-
cations in the following order:

EthidiumBromide alternative
answers
Dear EvoDir members:
Please, nd here below a summary of the answers I got
from all of you about question on DNA stain.
Thank you very much for your very useful suggestions!
Cheers,
Filippo
|{
1. The idea that Ethidium bromide is dangerous, espe-
cially at the quantities used to stain gels, is probably
false, and is certainly not based on sound mechanism52 EvolDir June 1, 2014
nor strong epidemiological evidence. The article
below is very interesting: http://goo.gl/AJKSup For
staining DNA on agarose, our labs use Gel red which
is no where as toxic as ethidium bromide http://-
www.bioscience.co.uk/site/user/ page.phtml?page id
22&search=gel+red&productgrp=OTHER&sid=tgtk74337
Did you try SYBR Safe from Invitrogen? We have been
using it for the past 9 months now and it is really reli-
able (we have even reduced the concentration by half).
4. We use a product called Gel Red. It works well. Not
sure who would carry it in Europe, but VWR carries it
in the states: http://biotium.com/technology/gelred-
gelgreen-nucleic-acid-gel-stains/ 5. Maybe GelRed
could help you (http://biotium.com/technology/
gelred-gelgreen-nucleic-acid-gel-stains/). During my
last internship, I used it. It is supposed to be non-
toxic, but my supervisor was not sure that degradation
pruducts were non-toxic.
Have you tried RedSafe? Here is as example: http://-
www.chembio.co.uk/ product detail.php?product id0
We use Midori green it's just as good if not better than
ethidium bromide and less toxic.
You may nd this blog post helpful: http:/-
/ rrresearch.eldofscience.com/2006/10/heresy-about-
ethidium-bromide.html
9. We use GelRed from Biotium. It is quite bright and
works with the same lters as ethidium bromide.
10. We use EZ-Vision: http://www.amresco-inc.com/-
home/products/best- sellers/EZ-Vision.cmsx
I have been using a product called SafeView by NBS
biologicals: http://www.nbsbio.co.uk/nbs-sv1 12. In
our population genetics lab, we use a product called
GelRed, manufactured by Biotium. It gives us very
good results. Bands are easily visible on the 1% and
2% agarose gels we use. We use the standard safety and
handling procedures as those with ethidium bromide
(gloves, gelred only glassware, contamination area, etc),
but it is reported to be non-toxic and non-mutagenic.
I hope this helps!
I use EZ-vision by Amresco. The RNA version also
works.
We use SafeView (www.nbsbio.co.uk/nbs-sv1) and have
never had any problems!
My lab uses SYBR Safe with a Blue-Light source. It
works nearly as well as Ethidium and is much safer:
http://www.lifetechnologies.com/ us/en/home/life-
science/dna-rna-purication-analysis/nucleic-acid-
gel-electrophoresis/dna-stains/sybr-safe.html
16. We use SybrSafe - it works nearly as well asEtBr: http:// www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/-
life-science/dna-rna-purication- analysis/nucleic-acid-
gel-electrophoresis/dna-stains/sybr-safe.html
Try Nancy-520 from Sigma: http://-
www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/ cell-
biology/detection/learning-center/nancy-520.html
Nancy seems like a nice alternative to SYBR and
ethidium bromide, but I've never used it.
We've had success with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain for
>7 years in the Johnson Lab, and, given it produces
comparable results while being much safer than ethid-
ium bromide, several other labs use it here on campus
at BYU. If there is a chance you could stick with SYBR,
maybe you could explain the problem in further detail,
and then people could help you arrive at a solution with
SYBR. So far, it remains unclear why these other op-
tions haven't worked for you.
We use a product called GelRed from Biotum. It works
quite wells as an \in-gel" or \post-gel" stain. http://-
biotium.com/technology/gelred- gelgreen-nucleic-acid-
gel-stains/
We use the GelRed Nucleic Acid Gel Stain from Bi-
otium (http:// biotium.com/product/gelredtm-nucleic-
acid-gel-stain-10000x-in-water/) and we have satisfac-
tory results. Here is our protocol:
Mix 1
4 mg of BFB (Bromophenol blue)
1 ml of mili-Q Water
Mix 2
174 ul of Mix 1
250 ul of glycerol
576 ul of mili-Q Water

Migrate-n question
Dear all,
I am a happy user of migrate-n by Peter Beerli but I
have not used the geole option so far. Now I may get
into a project where geo information is relevant. The
info in the manual about using the geole are pretty ba-
sic. I'm hoping that you could suggest papers in which
the geole was used in order to analyse genetic data in a
geographically explicit way. What are the most obvious
rst information that I could get out of using a geole?
Which further interesting analyses are possible?
Next, I also would like to understand changes over time
in my system. Skyline plots in migrate-n are the solu-
tion. Also here: Can you suggest papers where migrate-
n skyline plots were used?
Thanks and cheers, Robert

Partula website
I have a message that I hope will be of interest to
some users of evoldir, concerning the Partula snails that
were of historical importance in evolutionary biology,
although now largely forgotten about.
I have started a new website dedicated to the Partula
snails (or rather all Partulidae - Samoana and Eua asJune 1, 2014 EvolDir 55
well). This covers their diversity, evolution and conser-
vation. It is a work in progress and it is intended that
it will eventually include comprehensive lists of species,
synonyms, resources for identication and links to all
the useful literature on any aspect of the snails. Please
visit the website here http://islandbiodiversity.com/-

other new project of mine - preparation of a major
monograph on the fantastic diversity of the Partulidae

QuantitativeGeneticModels
Postdoc in Quantitative Genetic Models of Complex
Traits
The Danish Centre for Genomic Selection in Animals
and Plants (GenSAP) is seeking a motivated and pro-
ductive Post Doc to understand the mechanisms under-
lying the development of genetic variance of complex
traits under selection. The position is open for 2 years
with a possibility for extension.
Aim of project: The project aims to understand the
mechanisms underlying the development of genetic vari-
ance in populations under selection. We will do this by
developing a biology-based partitioning of genomic vari-
ance of complex trait phenotypes. Whole-genome se-
quences and multiple trait phenotypes from large num-
bers of individuals will soon be available in many pop-
ulations. These data allow a detailed molecular charac-
terization of the genetic variability at the sequence level
and should enable us to investigate several fundamen-
tal aspects of the genetic basis of complex traits. Well
established statistical modelling approaches enable the
genetic analyses of complex trait phenotypes while ac-
counting for a variety of additive and non-additive ge-
netic mechanisms. These modelling approaches have
proven to be highly useful to determine population ge-
netic parameters as well as prediction of genetic risk or
potential of complex trait phenotypes. Basic biology
tells us that complex trait phenotypes are expressed
as a result of interplay between molecular and cellular58 EvolDir June 1, 2014
components, each interacting at various levels (e.g. cel-
lular, molecules, RNA, DNA) entangled in various bio-
logical pathways. Fundamental research is required to
better understand how and to what extent it is useful to
use information on basic biology for partitioning the ge-
nomic variance of complex trait phenotypes. A number
of approaches will be used including 1) developing novel
genetic models, stochastic simulation tools, and statis-
tical modelling approaches, and 2) to apply these to
experimental data from Drosophila melanogaster and
from agricultural animal and plant populations.
GenSAP: The overall goal of GenSAP is to develop the
next generation genomic breeding tools for genetic im-
provement schemes in agricultural plants and animals.
GenSAP brings together Danish breeding companies
and research groups as well as leading international re-
search groups to make a joint strategic research eort
to build the foundation for next generation genomic se-
lection (GS). GenSAP will develop GS methodologies
across all agricultural species and integrate and extract
relevant information from the massive amounts of data
emerging from whole genome sequencing, functional ge-
nomics, epigenomics and complex phenotyping tech-
nologies. Improved GS models will be developed based
on ecient algorithms accounting for e.g. gene-by-gene
and gene-by-environment interactions. Advanced com-
putational tools for optimizing and evaluating selec-
tion decisions based on in silico data will be developed
to ensure a sustainable long-term implementation of
GS. For further information please visit our website:
www.gensap.au.dk . Qualication:
Ph.D. in quantitative genetics, evolutionary genetics,
statistical genetics, or related elds
Strong background and interest in quantitative genetic
models of complex traits
A solid understanding of statistical genetic methods
and experience with application of these to real data
Preferable experience in scripting and/or programming
Strong skills in oral and written communication in En-
glish
Ability to work in a large and diverse group of re-
searchers, and collaborate with international research
partners
Place of work: GenSAP is part of Center for Quantita-
tive Genetics and Genomics (QGG) at Aarhus Univer-
sity (AU). QGG is a major center for research and ed-
ucation in quantitative genetics, quantitative genomics
and breeding. It comprises 20 senior sta and a large
group of PhD.-students and postdocs. The center is
part of the Department for Molecular Biology and Ge-netics and is located at the AU Foulum campus (for the
locations of the department see http://mbg.au.dk/en/-
contact/how-to-nd-the-department/). QGG provides
a very dynamic and internationally orientated environ-
ment with strong collaborations with relevant industrial
partners and with several other leading international
research groups in the area.
Deadline and how to apply: All applications must be
made online and received by: 29.04.2014. For original
posting on AU website, more information, and link to

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Genome Assembly and Evo-
lutionary Genomics
A postdoctoral position is available immediately at the
Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics Group in
the Department of Computer Engineering in Bilkent
University, Ankara, Turkey. The position is joint with
the Somel Lab of the Department of Biological Sciences
in Middle East Technical University.
As the Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics
Group, we develop combinatorial algorithms to analyze
genomic sequence data to discover, genotype, and phase
genomic variants with a special focus on structural vari-
ation and segmental duplication. We are also interested
in de novo genome assembly and transcriptome analy-
sis. We apply our algorithms on sequence data gener-
ated from the genomes of various organisms including
humans, to catalog normal variation, and study genome
evolution.
The successful candidate will be responsible for leading
a project that involves de novo assembly and further
analysis of the genome of pearl mullet (Chalcalburnus
tarichi). The pearl mullet is the only sh (and the only
vertebrate) that lives in Lake Van in eastern Turkey,
and it shows remarkable adaptation to the saline and
extremely alkaline (pH 9.8) lake water. The genetic
and physiological mechanisms underlying this unique
trait, as well as the pearl mullet's population structure,
remain unknown.
The project will include the following steps: - De novo
assembly and the annotation of the pearl mullet genome
using both Illumina and Pacic Biosciences data. -
Comparative genomics analysis to understand the evo-
lution of the Cyprinidae family and adaptive evolu-
tion of the pearl mullet. - Transcriptome analysis for
genome annotation; identication of gene expression
networks underlying adaptation to alkaline water. -
Population genomics analysis of samples from dierentsections of the lake to understand the pearl mullet's
migration and breeding patterns and population his-
tory. More details can be found in our lab web page at:
http://donut.cs.bilkent.edu.tr Requirements: - Ph.D.
degree in bioinformatics, genomics, computer science,
or related elds. Ph.D. candidates who expect to grad-
uate soon are welcome to apply. - Experience in genome
assembly and annotation is strongly preferred. - Expe-
rience in evolutionary genetics, population genomics, or
transcriptome analysis is a plus. - Strong programming
skills in at least one high level programming language;
such as C, C++, Java, or Python.
A competitive salary and subsidized on-campus accom-
modation will be provided. The successful candidate
will also be encouraged to apply for the T ~ABATAK
2232 (for Turkish candidates) and the Co-Funded Brain
Circulation Scheme fellowship programs (all candi-

BTV is a vector-borne, segmented RNA virus, respon-
sible for a globally important disease in livestock. In
recent decades, repeated incursions of BTV into Eu-
rope have caused major outbreaks and signicant eco-
nomic damage. However, the major drivers behind
BTV emergence, spread and persistence remain poorly
understood. Based on extensive BTV collections at Pir-
bright, including comprehensive samples of recent Eu-
ropean BTV outbreaks, and novel sequencing technol-
ogy at the Sanger, our project is generating sequence
data sets of hundreds of BTV genomes accompanied by
detailed metadata (sampling date, farm location, host
species, etc). The successful candidate will be using
these data as platform for gaining new, fundamental
insights into the transmission dynamics of BTV, in-
cluding patterns and environmental drivers of spatial
spread and viral persistence, through the application
of phylodynamic and other computational approaches.
This work is expected to ll important gaps in our un-
derstanding of BTV epidemiology and to contribute to
novel control strategies. At the same time, the posi-
tion will give an opportunity to develop and test new
methodological approaches, and provide excellent train-
ing opportunities at the interface of viral evolution,
whole genome sequencing and infectious disease epi-
demiology, an emerging research area of increasing rel-

MarineAdaptiveChange
Anthropogenic climate change is already modifying the
ocean with natural systems particularly vulnerable. In
response to climate change, species will have to adapt or
die. This project will address the question: 'How much
capacity for adaptive change do marine species have un-
der current and projected rates of climate change?' We
propose to use cutting edge genomic techniques to in-
vestigate capacity in marine phytoplankton - the base
of the marine food chain. We have access to culture
strains maintained at the Australian National Algal
Culture Collection and with international partners.
Specically you will:
1) Carry out common 'garden pot experiments' to eval-
uate the performance of 3-4 representative strains of 3
dierent phytoplankton species under predicted future
and control present conditions of temperature and pH.
2) Carry out custom designed whole genome microar-
ray analysis and/or high throughput transcriptome se-
quencing to identify up/down regulated metabolic pro-
cesses in the short/medium term responses. 3) Quan-
titative Trait Locus crossing and back-crossing exper-
iments between strains with dierent adaptation phe-
notypes to map the major genes encoding the traits.

POSTDOC IN ECOLOGICAL/PHYSIOLOGICAL
GENOMICS
I am seeking a postdoctoral researcher to work on
some combination of laboratory, eld, and bioinformat-
ics projects related to adaptation genomics, with an
emphasis on thermal and seasonal ecology. Projects
in the lab focus on discovering genetic variants that
contribute to rapid evolutionary divergence and spe-
ciation among populations and statistically modeling
the physiological networks that transduce genotypes to
adaptive phenotypes. Phenotypes of interest include
life history timing (insect diapause), thermal stress re-
sistance, and capacity to exploit novel resources, espe-
cially in the context of environmental change. Exper-
imental approaches span eld ecology, genomics, tran-
scriptomics, and organismal physiology, and rely heav-
ily upon informatic processing and statistical modeling
of large, next generation sequencing data sets (http://-
www3.nd.edu/~gragland/). Some portion of the work
to be performed will include NSF-funded research on
the genetic and physiological modularity of evolving life
history components in the apple maggot y, a model
system for rapid adaptation and sympatric speciation.
This project is an ongoing collaboration with Je Feder
at Notre Dame and Dan Hahn at the University of
Florida, and opportunities for cross-disciplinary train-
ing in these labs may also be available. The postdoc
will also have the opportunity to perform independent
research according to his or her own interests and spe-
cic training.
Candidates must have a PhD in a biological discipline,
statistics, or computer science, and a proven record of
publication in ecological or evolutionary biology. Ideal
candidates will have a background in both molecular
laboratory techniques and Linux/scripting languages
(e.g., R, Perl or Python), though strong candidates
in either area will be considered. Salary will be com-
petitive, and commensurate with experience. The ini-
tial appointment is for one year, but up to three years
of funding are available based on satisfactory annual
progress.70 EvolDir June 1, 2014

The soon to be established Lowry lab in the Depart-
ment of Plant Biology at Michigan State University
(MSU) is looking to hire a Postdoctoral Research Asso-
ciate starting as soon as August 15, 2014. The research
of the Lowry lab is centered on identifying the genetic
and genomic mechanisms of ecological adaptations and
how those adaptations contribute to the formation of
new species. The successful candidate will be provided
with many opportunities to interact with the excellent
community of evolutionary biologists (https://-
eebb.msu.edu/faculty.pl?list=RA&sublist=1) and
plant scientists (http://www.plantbiology.msu.edu/)
at Michigan State University.
*Research Program Description:* Water availability is
one of the most limiting factors for crop production
and the fundamental factor governing the composition
of plant communities globally. The frequency and in-
tensity of drought has also long been known to be anJune 1, 2014 EvolDir 73
important selective agent during the evolution of plant
species. Therefore, the Lowry lab is particularly inter-
ested in understanding how dierences in water avail-
ability between habitats contribute to adaptive diver-
gence and reproductive isolation.
To understand the physiological, developmental, and
genetic mechanisms of adaptive divergence between
plant populations, the Lowry lab is focused on research
in two major emerging model systems for evolution-
ary genomics: Monkeyowers (*Mimulus*) and *Pan-
icum *grasses, including the bioenergy crop switch-
grass. Two large communities of collaborative scientists
have established extensive genomic and molecular biol-
ogy resources for these systems. The evolution of wet
and dry habitat adapted ecotypes has occurred in both
*Mimulus *and *Panicum*, and so these systems are
ideal for understanding the parallel evolution of adap-
tive divergence in response to soil water availability.
For more information, please see: http://-
davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com/ *Required Quali-
cations:* PhD in a eld related to Evolution, Genetics,
Genomics, Bioinformatics, and/or Plant Biology at the
time of hire.
*Highly Desired Qualications:* Experience program-
ming for biology, especially in relation to genomic anal-
yses. Experience with analyzing RNA-sequencing and
whole genome sequencing data.
*Desired Qualications:* Experience with making ge-
nomic libraries for Illumina sequencing. Molecular biol-
ogy and/or plant ecophysiology skills. General interest
in evolution, genetics, and plant biology.

merous individual-level decisions, and (2) conicts of in-
terest may exist between individual- and group-levels.
We propose to study how decisions coincide between
group and individual levels regarding resource alloca-
tion to reproduction, by combining theoretical and em-
pirical approaches. We will implement models of gen-
eral relevance, and use ants for empirical testing. Our
ultimate aim is to determine how the optimal group size
is determined by the environmental and spatial context
in which the population lives.
The modelling work will aim at determining the opti-
mal decisions related to (1) investment in reproduction,
(2) group size and (3) number of propagules produced.
These three components of the decision process depend
on social interactions and on environmental constraints.
Using game theoretical and adaptive dynamics meth-
ods, we intend to determine how the optimal decision
depends on the local environment, the spatial variations
in the environment, and the predictability of environ-
mental uctuations.
The second part of the project will consist in experi-
mental testing of the predictions born from the theo-
retical investigation. We will use the ant *Cataglyphis
cursor*, which we are familiar with and which presents
an interesting variability in decisions related to resource
allocation. Its colonies produce 2 to 7 ospring colonies,
to which they allocate 3 to 71% of their workers each.
We will manipulate resources availability and compe-
tition intensity in semi-natural enclosures and in the
eld, to study reproductive allocation in either stress-
ful or benign environments.

Hello,
Please nd below the description of a postdoctoral po-
sition to 'Search for common genetic goods in gene fam-
ilies and microbial communities
The theory of genetic public goods recently postu-
lated that genetic sequences can be exploited in various
combinations, even by distantly related or unrelated
evolving entities, i.e. microbial communities benet-
ing from the sharing of genes between their members,
such as photosynthesis genes between cyanophages and
cyanobacteria, or such as drug resistance genes within
multispecies biolm. Yet, the nature, size and diversity
of microbial communities sharing such genetic goods re-
main poorly known. Moreover, the rules of gene sharing
also remain to be described.
A wealth of molecular data from metagenomic, single
cell metagenomic, and microbial genomes projects is76 EvolDir June 1, 2014
now available to tackle these fundamental issues. Fur-
thermore, sequence similarity networks oer a promis-
ing complementary niche to phylogenetic methods to
exploit the complexity of these data. These graphs al-
low for mathematical analyses of genetic diversity and
similarities over dozens of millions of sequences, pro-
viding novel ways to detect clubs of genomes, which
have not necessarily evolved from a single last com-
mon ancestor yet exploit some common genetic mate-
rial. Likewise, these networks allows for the detection
of some sets of gene families that exploit common pools
of genetic fragments/domains.
To further develop the detection strategies of genetic
public goods, our lab is now looking for a post-doctoral
fellow in bio-informatics, who will be funded for up to
three years by an ERC grant (for a salary of 45,000
euros/year; approximately 2219 euros/ month after
taxes). The candidate will take advantage of graph
properties and algorithms from the graph theory: - to
improve the identication of clubs of genomes /sets of
gene and their pool of genetic goods in complex net-
works with a few millions nodes and dozens of mil-
lions of edges; - to analyze domains combinations in
genes and gene sharing in communities, using bipar-
tite graphs. - He/she will then analyze the functions of
these genetic goods and their distribution across genes
and genomes to test what lifestyles favors their sharing.
The candidate will work within a consortium of friendly
bioinformaticians (Philippe Lopez), evolutionary biol-
ogists (Eric Bapteste), and graph theorists (Michel
Habib, Laurent Viennot), and be hosted in the Uni-
versity Pierre and Marie Curie in the center of Paris,
France. The current team description and publica-
tions can be found at: http://www.evol-net.fr/ Ideally,
the candidate should have a good background in bio-
informatics, or graph theory and a strong interest for
evolutionary biology. The position will start by Novem-
ber 2014, but interested candidates are invited to apply
immediately.
Applicants are requested to send a detailed resume,
a motivation letter, a pdf copy of their masters the-
sis, and the names of two scientic referees to :

SeaweedPopGenomics
Dear all,
A two year postdoctoral research associate position
is available immediately at the Rosco Marine Lab-
oratory in France (http://www.sb-rosco.fr/rosco-
marine-station). The aim of the project is to study
the process of seaweed domestication and relation-
ships between crops and populations established in the
wild in two cultivated kelp species. This position is
funded in the context of the IDEALG project (http:/-
/www.idealg.ueb.eu/). Unlike many terrestrial plant
species, almost nothing is known about domestication
process in seaweed species.
The methodology is based on population genomic tools
with the development of GBS (genotyping by sequenc-
ing) protocol. By analyzing a large number of SNPs
we aim at 1) comparing cultivated and wild popula-
tions established over a diverse set of habitats and 2)
delineating sampling units that are relevant for marker
assisted selection and genes targeted by cultivation pro-
cesses for the two kelps. The identication of genes of
interest will be facilitated by haploid-diploid life cycle
characteristics of seaweed models used: meiotic segre-
gations can be studied directly by analyzing haploid
ospring sired by the sporophytic individuals, provid-
ing direct estimates of allelic eects.
Applicants must have a PhD in evolutionary biology
and expertise in population genomics. They must have
a strong background in population genetics analyses
and demonstrable experience in molecular biology and
bio-informatic techniques applied to population analy-
ses. No specic experience on algae or marine species
is necessary.
This is a collaborative project between the Diversity
and Connectivity in Coastal Marine Landscape group
(http://www.sb-rosco.fr/en-divco) and the Biodiver-
sity and Evolution of Marine Algae Group (http://-
www.sb-rosco.fr/umi-3614.html).
Salary will be 2000 EUR to 2500EUR per month (net)
depending on experience.
Candidates should submit their CV together with a
description of research experience, relevant publica-
tions and 2 letters of references to Fr ed erique Viard

StockholmU PopulationGenomics
Post-doc position: Population genomics of plant mat-
ing system shifts
A two-year post-doc position in population genomics is
currently available at Stockholm University, Sweden, in
the research group of Dr. Tanja Slotte.
Background Plant mating systems, such as shifts from
outcrossing to selng, have profound eects on levels
and structuring of genetic variation, and are expected
to have a marked eect on the impact of natural selec-
tion. We are interested in quantifying the demographic
and selective eects of mating system shifts using pop-
ulation genomic data. For a recent example of our work
on this topic in Capsella rubella, see Slotte et al. 2013
Nature Genetics 45:831-5.
Project The post-doc will contribute to population ge-
nomic analyses of several parallel mating system shifts
in the Brassicaceae. This will include investigating pop-
ulation structure, demographic shifts and assessing the
impact of natural selection in populations and species
that dier in their outcrossing rates. Whole-genome78 EvolDir June 1, 2014
and whole-transcriptome sequence data sets are already
available, and more are currently being generated in the
lab. The project oers plenty of opportunities for post-
docs to pursue their own ideas using available genomic
data.
Scientic Environment The Slotte lab (http://-
tanjaslottelab.wordpress.com) is part of the Dept. of
Ecology, Environment and Plant Science, Stockholm
University. We are located at Science for Life Labo-
ratories in Stockholm (http://www.scilifelab.se), which
holds considerable expertise in high-throughput se-
quencing technology and bioinformatics. The working
atmosphere is international with English as the work-
ing language, and the position oers excellent oppor-
tunities for scientic exchange with both genomicists,
evolutionary biologists and ecologists at SciLifeLab and
Stockholm University. The city of Stockholm is known
for its beauty, its buildings and architecture and its
abundant clean and open water.
Qualications We are looking for a post-doc with a
strong background and interest in population genetics,
and with the prerequisite bioinformatic skills to carry
out analyses of population genomic data sets. Experi-
ence in next-generation sequencing analyses and strong
computational skills are therefore a benet, and candi-
dates should have knowledge in at least one major pro-
gramming or scripting language and be able to work in
a Linux/Unix environment. A good understanding of
statistics and prociency in R is a plus. Candidates
should have a PhD either in a eld related to pop-
ulation genetics/evolutionary genetics or bioinformat-
ics/computational biology.

UArizona EcoEvolutionaryTheory
ClonalInterference
Postdoc position in eco-evolutionary theory
A postdoc position is available to work with PI Joanna
Masel (http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at
the University of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist
destination surrounded on all four sides by mountain-
ous national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city
of nearly a million people with an attractive climate.
The EEB department in Tucson was ranked in the top
10 by US News & World Report.
We seek to study evolutionary rescue in the presence
of clonal interference, via a model of asexual popula-
tion genetics (based on Desai & Fisher 2007). This
model will be modied so that genotypes specify ab-
solute tness in a deteriorating environment, rather
than relative tness as is the norm in population genet-
ics. The project will explore the integration of density-
dependence terms r and K with the classical population
genetics tness term of w, as part of an eco-evo the-
oretical synthesis. A strong quantitative background
together with computational and/or modeling experi-
ence is required. A background in evolutionary and/or
ecological theory is strongly preferred.
The Masel group's main research interests http:/-
/www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel/research/-
index.html are in robustness and evolvability, using
a mixture of analytical theory, bioinformatic and
simulation approaches. Contact Joanna Masel at

Another postdoctoral position (up to two years fund-
ing) is now available at the Universidade Federal de Sao
Carlos (UFSCar) working with Reinaldo A. de Brito,
in collaboration with Jason Wolf (University of Bath).
The collaboration oers the opportunity for the post-
doc to spend time in both Bath (UK) and Sao Carlos82 EvolDir June 1, 2014
(Brazil), with empirical components being done in Sao
Carlos and computational work being split between in-
stitutions.
The project is focused on understanding the genetic
architecture of species dierences in South American
fruit ies of the group Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera:
Tephritidae). The primary goal of the project is to un-
derstand the nature of variation underlying traits that
distinguish species (including major ecologically rele-
vant traits as well as traits potentially involved in mate
recognition) and how the species dierences relate to
within species variation.
The postdoc will contribute to empirical and computa-
tional components of the project. Empirical work will
involve implementation of multigenerational breeding
schemes, phenotyping and next-generation genotyping.
Computational work will involve genome scale analysis
of associations using marker and sequence data.
This is a second post-doc opportunity associated with
the project previously advertised. We expect that this
position will be lled by July (to ensure that the full
two years of funding is available). We are looking for
people interested in discussing the details of the project
and the application process. If you expressed interest in
the previously advertised position and would like to be
considered for this second position, please let us know
and send an updated CV.
Please contact either one of us for more information or
to express interest.

Postdoctoral position in Human Molecular Genet-
ics/Epigenetics
A postdoctoral position (two years at least) is available
in Connie Mulligan's lab at the University of Florida.
Two NSF-funded projects are currently ongoing and
the successful candidate can work on one or both: 1)
Examination of DNA methylation patterns in mothersand newborns from the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) to test whether epigenetic alterations mediate
the eects of maternal exposure to stressors on fetal
development and neonatal health. Specically, we are
testing if epigenetic modications may mediate changes
in gene expression in infants or mothers that result
from maternal trauma and material deprivation asso-
ciated with the war in the DRC. More broadly, we are
interested in the idea that behavior and complex phe-
notypes may be shaped by early life experiences that
alter gene expression through epigenetic alterations.
See https://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/-
epigenetics/2012EPI0162R-X.pdf 2) Investigation of
the genetic and cultural underpinnings of complex
diseases that exhibit racial inequalities, using hyper-
tension in African-Americans as a model phenotype.
We are combining the analysis of genome-wide SNPs,
genetic ancestry estimates, and epigenetic variation
with sociocultural data including experience of dis-
crimination and social network analysis. By combining
genetic and socio-cultural data, our goal is a more com-
prehensive investigation of complex disease and racial
disparities than is possible with only one type of data.
See related study - http://www.plosone.org/article/-
info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006821
Qualications: A PhD and a strong background
in generation of genetic data (microarray analysis,
DNA sequencing, SNP detection, etc.) and data
analysis (gene association analysis, regression analysis,
genetic ancestry estimation, linkage analysis, etc) are
essential. Experience generating methylation data or
additional computational experience (e.g. computer
programming, simulation analysis, etc) is a plus.
In addition to the projects listed above, there are
excellent opportunities for the successful candidate to
develop new lines of research as well as productive
collaborations outside the lab.
The University of Florida is a leading research in-
stitution with a university-wide commitment to ge-

SelfIncompatibility
*Post-doctoral position on the origin of functional nov-
elty at the self-incompatibility locus in Arabidopsis*
We are looking for a post-doctoral associate to work
on allelic diversication at the self-incompatibility lo-
cus in the outcrossing Arabidopsis species /A. halleri/.
While the genes encoding self-incompatibility are typ-
ically highly multiallelic, the emergence of new allelic
specicities has remained a mystery. This is in par-
ticular due to the functional constraint caused by the
fact that these genes encode a molecular lock-and-key
mechanism, whereby both the lock and the key must
both be hit by novel cognate mutations in order for the
system to remain functional. To address this issue, the
project will use a resurrectionapproach to recon-struct ancestral protein sequences and express them in
/A. thaliana/ using tools of genetic transformation to
test whether contemporary specicities have retained
identical recognition phenotypes as compared to their
ancestor.
The ideal candidate should have either previous experi-
ence with genetic transformation in /A. thaliana/ and
a keen interest in evolutionary biology or a strong back-
ground in evolutionary biology with demonstrated abil-
ities in either molecular biology or the management of
large experimental designs in plants. A high level of
autonomy is required. Initial duration of the post-doc
in one year with possible extension for an additional 6
months. Salary is competitive and commensurate with
experience. The position is available now and the start-
ing date should be no later than July 1 ^st .
Applicants should send a letter describing their

(IESs), which are believed to be degenerate remnants
of ancient transposable element insertions. We are se-
quencing MIC genomes of dierent strains and species
of the Paramecium genus to reconstruct the evolution-
ary history of IESs and to test the hypothesis that poly-
morphisms in these elements result in sexual incompat-ibility.
Candidates must hold a Ph.D. in computational bi-

Dear colleagues,
We are looking for a highly motivated young scientist
specialized in bio-informatics (NGS data management,
programming and modeling) and with good knowledge
in genomics to apply for a post-doctoral position at the
UNESP (Universidade Estadual Paulista) laboratory of
Molecular Evolution in S~ ao Jos e do Rio Preto (Brazil),
through a post-doctoral program sponsored by a Brazil-
ian Funding Agency. Portuguese is not mandatory; the
working language will be English.
The post-doctoral position will aim to analyze the
data obtained from the re-sequencing of dierent Cof-
fea canephora genotypes representative of the natural
genetic diversity of this species in Africa. It will take
advantage of the forthcoming publication of the model
genome of C. canephora and a long experience of the
collaborative network involved in this project. The ap-
plication must include a project, already dened but
which will be implemented by the candidate with great
support from the participating teams and should be
completed according to the candidate's research expe-
riences.
The position is for one year renewable once.
Candidates must send their CV and a cover letter
to Claudia Marcia Carareto (carareto@ibilce.unesp.br),
Val erie Poncet (valerie.poncet@ird.fr) and Alexandre
de Kochko (alexandre.dekochko@ird.fr) ASAP.
Coee is the world's second largest agricultural com-
modity and agricultural employment. Brazil is the rst
coee producer worldwide; it is also an important con-
sumer. Coea canephora (Robusta) provides 33% of the
global coee production and 22% of the Brazilian cof-
fee production (2013). Climate change (warming and
changes in rainfall patterns) may have strong negative
impacts on coee production. The world's foremost
climate science group, the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC 2014)1, has indeed included the
negative eects of warming on coee as part of a land-
mark report on the global impacts of climate change.
Adaptive strategies to mitigate these eects may largely
depend on our knowledge of how crops respond to cli-
mate variability and on the availability of genetic re-
sources within wild populations. But in spite of this
threat, climate eects on coee tree yields and genetic
diversity for adaptive traits have so far been poorly
analyzed or only partially on specic cultivated vari-
eties. Moreover, even though C. canephora not being
the most preferred coee on the market, it constitutes
the highest genetic diversity in the Coea genus and
therefore exploring its genetic background in relation
to physiological adaptability oers the highest oppor-
tunity for improving and sustaining coee productivity
worldwide.
In the proposed research we will address the issue of
Coea canephora resilience by:
Assessing the genetic diversity and structural genomic
dierences in C. canephora by analyzing data issued
from the resequencing of a set of wild genotypes rep-
resentative of the species genetic structure. In addi-
tion, partial resequencing (GBS) of a large set of both
cultivated and wild genotypes is also conducted; cul-
tivated Brazilian genotypes (Conilon) are part of this
eort. The postdoctoral fellow will take a particular at-
tention to the possible variations of alleles and/or par-
alogs linked to the species adaptive capability provoked
by possible insertions of mobile elements. A particular
attention will be paid to genes potentially involved in
drought tolerance. Evolutionary scenarios will also be
drawn to explain phylogenetic relationships within C.
canephora and dene the present mechanisms involved
in its genetic dierentiation.
The project will take advantage of the rst C.
canephora genome to be publicized soon.

UZurich EcolGenomics HostParasite
Postdoc position in Genomics of Host-Parasite Interac-
tions University of Zurich, Switzerland
In this project, embedded in the University Re-
search Priority Program 'Evolution in Action' (http://-
www.evolution.uzh.ch/index.html), we combine ecolog-
ical research on natural rodent populations along alti-
tudinal gradients in the Swiss Alps with genomics ap-
proaches to obtain insight into the genetic basis of vari-
ation in Borrelia resistance and the role of pathogens inshaping adaptive processes in natural host populations.
The postdoc's focus will be on the genomics aspects of
this project.
Wild rodents are main hosts of the spirochete Bor-
relia sp., the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis
in humans. Despite frequent exposure to Borrelia-
transmitting ticks, only a fraction of animals within
a population become Borrelia-infected, indicating that
natural hosts have evolved powerful defence mecha-
nisms, which prevent and / or control Borrelia infection.
To date, this variation in Borrelia resistance remains
poorly understood. Furthermore, in the Alps, host
populations dier in tick and Borrelia exposure, with
high parasite pressure at lower elevations and low para-
site pressure at higher elevations, and there is evidence
that Borrelia has recently moved upwards and newly
infects host populations that were previously Borrelia-
free. This provides a unique opportunity to track rapid
evolutionary changes in host populations in response to
an emerging pathogen.
The ideal candidate for this project is fascinated by
evolutionary questions, has a can-do attitude and ex-
perience in ecological genomics and bioinformatics.
The postdoc will be based at the Institute of Evo-
lutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of the
University of Zurich, providing ample opportunities
for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary elds (http:/-
/www.ieu.uzh.ch). The institute is very international
and the working language is English.
The position is funded for 1 year (gross salary CHF
75'500 per annum). However, the successful appli-
cant is strongly encouraged to apply for competi-
tive internal funding (http://www.researchers.uzh.ch/-
promotion/forschungskredit/postdoc en.html) to ex-
tend the position to up to 3 years. The ideal starting
date is autumn 2014 (negotiable).
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlin-
ing your motivation to work on this project as well
as relevant experience, 2) a detailed curriculum vi-
tae, and 3) the contact details of three academic ref-
erees. Send the above as a single .pdf le to bar-

Post doc position in single cell gene expression analysis
A 2-year postdoctoral research position is available in
the group of Jochen Wolf at the Evolutionary Biology
Centre in Uppsala, Sweden, as part of a project funded
by funded by the European (ERC) and Swedish Re-
search councils (VR).
Background. We are a young, growing research group
that applies an integrative approach to study evolution-
ary processes in natural populations. Major research
themes include the evolutionary processes and genetic
mechanisms underlying species divergence (e.g. Wolf et
al. 2010a, Ellegren et al. 2012, Poelstra et al. in press)
and genome evolution (e.g. Mugal et al. 2014).
The position is part of a long-term research program
on the genomics of speciation in an avian model sys-
tem. The European crow hybrid zone between all-
black carrion crows and grey-coated hooded crows is
a textbook example of incipient speciation involving
colour-mediated social selection (Meise 1928, Wolf et
al. 2010b). We generated an annotated hooded crow
genome draft generated data for integrated analyses of
comparative genome re-sequencing data, transcriptome
expression proling and functional assays on plumage
colouration. We nd that only a small well-dened part
of the genome diverged between the two sub-species
which is associated with gene expression divergence
in pigmentation genes causing dierences in eumelanin
production in growing feather follicles (Poelstra et al.
in press).
The project. Tissue based RNA-seq data integrates
across many cell types and has poor resolution in un-
derstanding cell-type specic divergence in gene ex-
pression. In the crow system, we are specically in-
terested in expression patters in melanocytes, the cell
types that are responsible for melanin production and
eventually colour deposition into the feathers. The suc-
cessful candidate will use in situ proximity (mRNA) lig-
ation assays developed by colleagues in Uppsala (Lars-
son et al. 2010) to 1) obtain positional information of
gene expression and 2) quanticy relative mRNA abun-
dance in single melanocyte cells. He/she will establish
this method on cross-sections of growing feather ma-
terial to specically pinpoint the action of candidate
genes from the melanogenesis pathway (for more in-
formation on the method see http://www.igp.uu.se/-June 1, 2014 EvolDir 93
research/molecular tools/ola soderberg/).
Qualication. The successful applicant has demon-
strated skills in molecular and histological techniques,
e.g. cyro-sectioning of dicult material; RNA in
situ hybridisation, ideally uorescent multiplexed; im-
munohistochemistry, confocal microscopy. Experience
with quantitative approaches and in situ Proximity-

across the entire species range and populations from
its Californian sister species (Zalophus californianus)
the project addresses key evolutionary processes such
as the genetic basis of tness, adaptation, and speci-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
