Call for Papers and Participants
Next January 4-8 at the 2008 Paciﬁc Symposium
for Biocomputing (PSB 2008) in Hawaii <http://-
psb.stanford.edu/ >,there will be a session entitled,
“Beyond Gap Models: Reconstructing Alignments and
Phylogenies Under Genomic-Scale Events,” chaired by
Michael Brudno, Randy Linder, Bernard Moret, and
Tandy Warnow. The session will focus on multiple
sequence alignment and phylogeny estimation undercomplex models of evolution. We invite papers that
present and evaluate in some detail new models and
methods for these two problems and that go beyond
the current limitations for handling indels and site sub-
stitutions, e.g., by (1) including location- or neighbor-
dependencies, (2) modeling larger scale events (dupli-
cation and loss, rearrangements, etc.), or (3) targeting
noncoding regions.
The full “Call for Papers and Posters” can be viewed at:
<http://psb.stanford.edu/cfp-gap.html >. Please note
that PSB is a bit diﬀerent than most standard biologi-
cal conferences. Papers that are submitted for presen-
tation will be peer reviewed and published. The core
of the conference consists of rigorously peer-reviewed
full-length papers reporting on original work. Accepted
papers will be published in a hard-bound archival pro-
ceedings (equivalent to a peer-reviewed journal publi-
cation), and the best of these will be presented orally to
the entire conference. You can view previous publica-
tions at <http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/ >. The
ﬁnal submission date for papers is July 17, 2007.
Researchers wishing to present their research without
oﬃcial publication are encouraged to submit a one page
abstract by November 9, 2007 to present their work in
the poster sessions.
If you are interested in participating in the session, but
are not sure whether your work would be appropriate,
please feel free to contact one of the session chairs. We
are very interested in having both computational and
biological perspectives presented at the session and in
generating interactions between the biological and com-
putational ﬁelds. We very much want to encourage the
biological evolution community to participate.

SYMPOSIUM: MECHANISMS OF GENOME EVO-
LUTION6 EvolDir May 1, 2007
AMERICAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION ANNUAL
MEETING
11-13 July, 2007 Indiana University, Bloomington, IN
http://www.theaga.org/agasymposium/index.html
Conference organized by Michael Lynch and Eva Allen.
The availability of genome-sequence data has forever
transformed our ability to understand the molecular
basis of the evolutionary process, but it also remains
true that the mechanisms of evolutionary change ul-
timately reside at the population-genetic level. Thus,
the goal of this conference is to help bring about a syn-
thesis of our understanding of genomic evolution from
the standpoint of both population genetics and molec-
ular biology, and to outline the major challenges to the
transformation of the descriptive ﬁeld of comparative
genomics into an explanatory ﬁeld of evolutionary ge-
nomics. The meeting will consist of talks and poster
and discussion sessions to encourage broad participa-
tion. Funds will be made available, on a competitive
basis, to defray the costs of student registration.

Convergence of Genomics and the Land Grant Mis-
sion: Emerging Trends in the Application of Ge-
nomics in Agricultural Research Purdue University,
West Lafayette, Indiana September 10-12, 2007
You are invited to attend this national conference on
agricultural genomics. The conference will feature in-
vited presentations by recognized leaders in agricultural
genomics from across the Land Grant University land-
scape and beyond. Topics focused on microbes, arthro-
pods, plants, animals and ecological systems will be
blended into sessions that address the following themes:
* Transition from Model to Agricultural Species * Inte-
grating Information Across Databases * Translational
Challenges and Successes
Speakers will address emerging trends, opportunities
for interactions with other genomics research groups,
collaborations with applied researchers, and priorities
for the future address. The meeting will conclude with
a roundtable discussion and recommendations led by
a distinguished panel. The conference is modeled after
the Gordon Research conferences where all speakers are
invited and the number of talks is limited to maximize
interactions among participants. Poster presentations
will be available to those interested.
This conference promises to be a rare opportunity to
exchange scientiﬁc expertise and experiences among ge-
nomics researchers and stimulate new discussions with
applied researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers
who do not normally interact with the genomics com-
munity. The goal of the conference is to promote syn-
ergisms across disciplines, commodities, and species. A
committee of recognized national leaders in molecular
biology and genomics helped develop the program.
The ﬁnal list of topics and speakers is now set (see the
attachment or the website below for details). Regis-
tration and requests to submit poster presentations are
now being accepted. To learn more about the program,

of the art assessment of what evolutionary thinking can
contribute to an integrated understanding of the pro-
cesses shaping host-parasite interactions. The confer-
ence is structured in three major topics, which are inti-
mately linked with each other. Topic 1. Understanding
the genetic interactions between hosts and parasites.
Topic 2. Host and parasite evolution and the mainte-
nance of sexual reproduction Topic 3. The evolutionary
genetics of immune defence.

Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to introduce you to WEBS (Women
Evolving Biological Sciences), an annual three-day sym-
posium aimed at addressing the retention of female sci-
entists and issues related to the transition of women
from early career stages to tenure track positions and10 EvolDir May 1, 2007
leadership roles in academic and research settings. We
would appreciate your assistance in passing along this
information to any of your colleagues who you think
will be interested in our program.
WEBS will target early career women in the Biological
Sciences with an emphasis on ecology and evolutionary
biology. In particular, it will focus on women who have
earned their doctoral degrees within the past two to
eight years and who do not have tenure in order to ad-
dress the critical transition period from graduate stud-
ies and post-doctoral positions to permanent research
and teaching positions. The symposia will provide a
forum for professional development, including aware-
ness and improvement of academic leadership skills;
opportunities to establish mentoring relationships; and
resources for developing professional networks. *The
2007 symposium will be held at Packforest Conference
Center outside of Seattle, Washington from October
14-17, 2007.*
Please visit our website ( http://-
www.webs.washington.edu ) for details and application
materials. Feel free to contact us with any ques-
tions you might have (websinfo@u.washington.edu).

We still have room left for contributed talks to our sym-
posium on
“Plant eco-devo”: ecology and genetics of life history
timing in plants
at the 11th Conference of the European Society for Evo-
lutionary Biology (ESEBXI) in Uppsala, Sweden.
Symposium description: The timing of the crucial tran-
sitions in a plant’s life (germination, onset of ﬂowering)
has strong consequences for its ﬁtness. It is regulated
by a combination of responses to environmental cues
(temperature, daylength) and to internal status (age,
size). Natural selection can act on variation in the way
the information is used, which is important in changing
environments. This symposium aims to bring togetherresearchers in both genetics and ecology, to discuss how
our knowledge of e.g. pathways involved in ﬂower in-
duction in model species can help understand their role
in nature.
Invited speakers: Kathleen Donohue, Harvard Univer-
sity, USA Outi Savolainen, University of Oulu, Finland
Sonia E. Sultan, Wesleyan University, USA
ESEB XI is held from 20 to 25 August 2007 in Up-

(talks and posters) for the symposium *The Evolution
of Sex Chromosomes* at the 11th conference of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) 2007
in Uppsala, Sweden.
Symposium description: Sex chromosomes evolved re-
peatedly in many lineages. Repeatedly, the non-
recombining, unisexually restricted chromosome has de-
generated resulting in the asymmetrical chromosomal
complements in the two sexes. Understanding of the
evolution of sex chromosomes and of the genes located
on the sex chromosomes promises to shed unique light
on the key evolutionary processes aﬀecting all genes
genome-wide.

European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
conference 2007, Uppsala, Sweden.
Symposium description: We will bring together re-
searchers who have contributed to our expanding ap-
preciation for the complexity of social interactions in
microbes and parasites and discuss insights gained from
the recent synthesis of evolution and microbiology. The
use of micro-organisms and parasites to test theory on
the evolution of social interactions has provided revolu-
tionary insights to this ﬁeld. Researchers can directly
compare the ﬁtness of alternate social strategies: ag-
gression, exploitation and cooperation. Furthermore,
many social traits have implications for the virulence
of parasites and microbial disease.

AberystwythU Birdsong
Birdsong in cities: eﬀects of urban noise on song learn-
ing and female choice in great tits
Song repertoire size is an established male trait involved
in both territorial defence and mate attraction in great
tits (Parus major). Recently noise pollution has been
shown to eﬀect song learning and production in great
tits as birds in noisy areas appear to drop low frequency
syllables from their songs. However, it remains unclear
whether these changes alter signal eﬀectiveness when
males disperse from their natal area. This project will
use ﬁeld observation and experimental playback exper-
iments to investigate responses to variations in singing
behaviour in diﬀerent acoustic environments. It will
also make predictions concerning the evolution of sig-
nalling and learning in the context of sexual selection
and speciation.

We are seeking a motivated and creative PhD Student
in Entomology with a Diploma (MSc) degree in Biology
or related University Degree.
The project deals with the ecology and behaviour of
a parasitoid wasp of practical agricultural signiﬁcance,
occurring naturally in Switzerland. In particular, the
focus will be on the examination of the costs of inbreed-ing and their avoidance. We expect new insights into
how behavioural decisions can aﬀect optimal sex ratios
and ultimately improve the ﬁtness of mass-reared and
released parasitoids. Methods will integrate ﬁeld sur-
veys, behavioural experiments, ﬁtness assays and the
use of molecular tools. Results shall contribute to the
fundamental understanding of sex allocation and mat-
ing structures in parasitoids, as well as to a sound ap-
plication of biological control strategies.
Languages spoken in the group are mainly German and
English.
The position is funded for a duration of three years,
and is open until ﬁlled.
Interested candidates should submit a curriculum vitae

PhD position Introgression in GM carrot, Leiden, the
Netherlands
1 PhD (F/M) (full time position, 4 years), vacancy ref-
erence number: 7-084 At the Centre of Environmental
Sciences (CML), Leiden University
The project: Through outcrossing, genes from culti-
vars can be taken up by wild relatives, this is called
introgression. There is growing economical interest and
concern about the genetic modiﬁcation of crops and the
introgression of transgenes to wild relatives. Estimates
of the rate and probability of introgression are therefore
needed.
Random events play a large role in the introgression
process, resulting in a large variation between geno-
types of hybrids en their reproductive success. Aim of
the project is to develop an accurate measure of the
chance of the introgression of transgenes: the “hazardMay 1, 2007 EvolDir 17
rate”. This measure will be calculated on the basis
of mathematical models. The parameters for the de-
veloped models will be estimated from crossing exper-
iments, molecular- and ﬁeld work. A model study is
carried out on carrot and its wild relatives.
This project is a part of a collaboration between math-
ematicians, ecologists and molecular biologists. Within
this program 2 PhD’s and 1 Postdoc will be appointed.
PhD position In this PhD project the ﬁtness of hybrids
between crosses of wild and cultivated carrots will be
determined under varying environmental conditions. In
collaboration with the postdoc the PhD student will
estimate with molecular techniques which part of the
genome have the highest ﬁtness eﬀects. Together with
the postdoc and the other PhD student the amount of
gene ﬂow between wild and cultivated carrot will be
estimated on the basis of ﬁeld surveys.
The candidate should have: - a degree in ecology (popu-
lation dynamics), plant breeding or environmental biol-
ogy - knowledge of modern molecular techniques - expe-
rience with growing plants - aﬃnity with GIS, database
manipulations and internet applications - drivers li-
cense - Suﬃcient ﬂuency in writing and speaking En-
glish
The salary in the ﬁrst year is 1956,00 gross per month
increasing to 2502,00 gross per month in the fourth
year. The appointment is temporal with a duration of 4
years, and must be concluded with a PhD thesis. After
one year an assessment will be made of the project and
the candidate.

Plant evolution: mapping invasiveness of weeds
A highly motivated student is required to undertake
a PhD project to examine the link between adaptiveevolution and invasiveness in ﬁreweed (Senecio mada-

tion of invasiveness in several weed species. Currently,
the Lowe lab is investigating the role of selection, ad-
mixture and hybridisation (with Senecio pinnatifolius)
on the genome and gene expression of ﬁreweed. The
project requires generation of genetic linkage maps to
test for associations between candidate genes under se-
lection, phenotypic traits and invasiveness; diﬀerences
in genetic architecture between source and introduced
populations of ﬁreweed; and diﬀerences in the genetic
architecture of S. madagascariensis and S. pinnatifolius.

2 PhD Studentships available (funded by the Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation)
POSITION DESCRIPTION: Two PhD positions are
available in the Group of Plant Population Ecology at
the Botanical Institute, University of Basel in a re-
search project with the title: “How glacial history, se-
lection and current gene ﬂow aﬀect alpine plants: Pop-
ulation diﬀerentiation, local adaptation and demogra-
phy in a fragmented landscape”. The proposal is a
experimentally-based ﬁeld study, including molecular
and modeling work. The project is based on results
from earlier and ongoing research. As a whole, the
question is addressed of how plant species are able to
survive and perform in the naturally fragmented alpine
landscape. Typically, widespread alpine plants showMay 1, 2007 EvolDir 19
high levels of genetic variation and adaptation to local
conditions. The project includes several parts: (1) Ex-
periments in the common garden and reciprocal trans-
plantation with plant material from the entire alpine
belt will serve to test for population diﬀerentiation and
local adaptation in alpine species due to geographic ori-
gin (i.e. glacial history) and environmental conditions.
(2) Speciﬁc experiments will be performed to test adap-
tation to particular selection regimes. (3) Genetic di-
versity and gene ﬂow will be analyzed using molecular
markers and ﬁeld experiments. By combining experi-
ments with widespread alpine plant species, measure-
ments of actual gene ﬂow and colonization potential,
and modeling of meta-population dynamics in a real
landscape, the project links processes operating at dif-
ferent time and spatial scales. Students have the chance
to work in a small and motivated research group. The
positions are founded for three years. Preferably, work
starts in June or by arrangement. Starting salary will
be CHF 34’200.- per year.
REQUIREMENTS: The successful candidates should
be motivated to work on alpine ecology. Experiences in
experimental population biology, a sound background
in statistics, and skills or interest in molecular work
would be appreciated. Applicants should enjoy work-
ing in the ﬁeld, as well as in the lab. There will be
a clear distribution of responsabilities among the two
PhD-students and a strong emphasis on cooperation for
practical work.

PhD position in a collaborative project of the Univer-
sity of Bremen and the ICIPE at Nairobi, Kenya.
Project title: Mango seed weevil bioecology and man-agement in Kenya
Description: We are looking for a PhD student to study
the bioecology and management of the mango seed
weevil (MSW) (Sternochetus mangiferae) using ento-
mopathogenic fungi and soft pesticides.
The mango seed weevil is an important pest of mango
that is responsible for direct damage to fruit pulp, pre-
mature fruit drop and sometimes associated with re-
duced seed germination. It is also a major quaran-
tine pest in many countries thereby limiting export of
mango from Africa to lucrative markets in the EU, the
Middle East and USA. The overall goals of this project
are to quantity the level of damage by MSW to mango
in relation to variety, season and locality and better un-
derstand ecological aspects of the pest with regard to
its dynamics and distribution to guide in the deploy-
ment of control strategies. Our short term goals with
regard to management is to identify candidate ento-
mopathogenic fungi and or soft pesticide that could be
used for management of the pest and to develop appro-
priate ﬁeld application strategy based on soil or trunk
application. The successful candidate will screen dif-
ferent isolates of entomopathogenic fungi, evaluate the
eﬀect of abiotic factors on candidate isolates, develop
appropriate formulation of the pathogen and assess ﬁeld
persistence and application strategy. The research ac-
tivity is a component of a mango IPM project targeting
other mango pests such as fruit ﬂies and mealybugs in
sub-Saharan Africa and the position is based at icipe,
Nairobi, Kenya. The experimental work will be carried
out at the icipe, Nairobi, Kenya and the successful can-
didate will obtain a PhD in Biology at the University
of Bremen, Germany.
Qualiﬁcations. This position requires a MSc or equiv-
alent in entomology, biology, ecology or related ﬁelds.
Familiarity with insect pathology is desirable.

Lichen Diversity of Aspen - a Component of the Ex-
tended Phenotype
BBSRC CASE Studentship with Macaulay Institute
This study will test the hypotheses that the lichen ﬂora
associated with aspen (Populus tremula), varies be-
tween aspen clones and represents a component of the
tree’s extended phenotype, which is genetically based
and mediated by its phenolic secondary metabolites.
Lichens are a very species rich component of the bio-
diversity of oceanic regions and in Scotland alone, epi-
phytic lichens on aspen comprise over 300 species. Se-
lection of genotypes and management of aspen wood-
lands for conservation and biomass production, could
thereby have a profound inﬂuence on the associated
biodiversity, particularly the lichens.
The overall approach will be to implement an induc-
tive ﬁeld-monitoring programme complemented by ﬁeld
experiments. The role of host genotypic variation and
bark phytochemistry as determinants of lichen distribu-
tion, abundance and species richness will be determined
between populations along a climatic gradient, and in
relation to a range of physical factors. These include
age of stand, light, water stress, host bark topography
and nutrients. Variation in lichen communities within
populations between aspen clones, characterised using
existing microsatellite markers, and independently of
biogeographic factors, will be established. Experimen-tal approaches will manipulate leachate quality and
quantity in stemﬂow whilst measuring rates of colonisa-
tion and community succession between individual trees
with contrasting phytochemistry.

UGuelph 2 MolEvol
I am looking for two PhD candidates with research in-
terests in molecular evolution to start in September
2007. These positions will be partially supported by
funds provided by a special program at the Univer-
sity of Guelph and are only open to Canadian citi-
zens. Interested students should contact Dr. Teresa
Crease at tcrease@uoguelph.ca. Additional information
about the Zoology graduate program at the University
of Guelph can be found at http://www.uoguelph.ca/-
ib/graduate zoology2.shtml . A description of my re-
search interests is provided below.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is an important multigene
family that codes for the structural RNA molecules
that make up ribosomes. One unit of rDNA consists
of 3 genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA) separated
by intergenic spacers. The spacers contain sequences
that control the expression of the rRNA genes. Some
regions of these genes evolve very slowly while other re-
gions, known as expansion segments, and the intergenic
spacers evolve very rapidly. Despite this rapid evolution
in their sequence, they still maintain their function. In
addition, it has been observed that sequence similar-
ity among the members of this multigene family is high
within species relative to similarity between copies from
diﬀerent species. This phenomenon is known as ?con-
certed evolution?.
Due to variation in the rate of evolution in diﬀerent
parts of the same repeat unit, rDNA is an excellent
model system with which to study the interaction be-
tween the molecular processes that cause concerted evo-
lution, and natural selection to maintain the structure
and function of the molecule. I use freshwater crus-May 1, 2007 EvolDir 21
taceans in the genus Daphnia as a model organism
for this work as they contain unusually long expansion
segments, and show variation in breeding system with
some populations reproducing by cyclical and others by
obligate parthenogenesis.
The current goals of my research program are to:
1) test the hypothesis that rates of recombination and
rDNA copy number diﬀer between Daphnia species,
and thus cause diﬀerences in their rates of concerted
evolution
2) test the hypothesis that natural selection is acting on
rRNA gene expansion segment length variation within
species
3) identify proteins that bind to the ribosomal inter-
genic spacer, and determine the impact of intra- and
interspeciﬁc variation on the interaction between this
sequence and these proteins
4) determine the impact of breeding system and ge-
nomic location on the evolution of a Daphnia transpo-
son, Pokey, that is found both inside and outside of the
rDNA.

ductive Strategies in Rodents
Inbred laboratory animals provide powerful tools to dis-
sect the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying an-
imal behaviour and physiology under highly controlled
conditions that strictly limit experience and avoid “un-
wanted” individual variation. However, understanding
the functions and evolution of species-speciﬁc behaviour
patterns and strategies requires a much more natural-
istic approach, taking into account the normal condi-
tions, genetic variability and prior experience of ani-
mals in natural populations. Rodents use scent cues
to recognize each other, assess each individual’s cur-
rent status and prime their reproductive physiology ac-
cording to the local social environment. As yet, we
have little understanding of how these cues are used
to modify reproductive strategies in normal popula-
tions. This project will use carefully controlled, non-
invasive experiments to understand how and why an-
imals use these cues under naturalistic social condi-
tions. The student will join our Mammalian Behaviour
and Evolution Group ( www.liv.ac.uk/mbe ) which has
strong interests in mammalian communication and re-
productive strategies and excellent facilities for study-
ing rodents under a wide range of conditions. This
is part of a long term research programme conducted
in close collaboration with the Proteomics and Func-
tional Genomics Group ( www.liv.ac.uk/pfg ), providing
opportunities to explore the molecular basis of scent
cues in addition to the behavioural and reproductive
responses to social signals. You will gain a ﬁrst class
training in experimental approaches in behavioural and
evolutionary biology, and a detailed understanding of
both chemical communication in animals and the evo-
lution of their reproductive strategies. We are look-
ing for an individual with a strong interest and back-
ground in animal behaviour and evolutionary biology
(Upper Second or First Class Honours degree achieved
or anticipated). The studentship is subject to BBSRC
restrictions ( www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/training ). Non-
EU students are not eligible. The studentship is avail-
able immediately (a start date before 31 July is prefer-
able).

EvolOriginOfNerveCells
PhD position in Evo-Devo (Paris, France). A position
for a PhD student is available at the University Pierre
et Marie Curie, Paris (Ecole Doctorale Diversite du Vi-
vant) on the following subject: &laquo;The molecular
toolkit of the ancestral nerve cell: reconstructing its
content and evolutionary origin. A comparative ap-
proach using sponge, ctenophore and cnidarian tran-
scriptomes&#8221;. The nerve cell was acquired in a
common ancestor of cnidarians, ctenophores and Bi-
lateria, while the sponges retained the primitive ab-
sence of a nervous system. Abundant data are available
on the &#8220;molecular toolkit&#8221; used for the
speciﬁcation and diﬀerentiation of nerve cells in the Bi-lateria. This PhD project aims at reconstructing the
ancestral molecular toolkit of the nerve cell and its
evolutionary origin. The work will start from exist-
ing EST collections, recently sequenced by the Geno-
scope, from the sponge Sycon raphanus, the cnidar-
ian Clytia hemisphaerica and the ctenophore Pleuro-
brachia pileus. The ﬁrst step will be to look for or-
thologues of bilaterian structural or regulatory genes
involved in speciﬁcation/diﬀerentiation of nerve cells.
Their expression will be studied by in situ hybridis-
ation and compared, between the three model species.
Evolutionary scenarios will then be formalised, by map-
ping characters on the phylogeny. For example, data
from the sponge may give insights about the ancestral
functions of these molecules, before their recruitment in
the nervous system. The project also comprises a phy-
logenomic part, in order to improve the resolution of
relationships between sponges, cnidarians, ctenophores
and bilaterians.
The PhD student will work in the Department
UMR 7138 &#8220;Systematique, Adaptation, Evo-
lution&#8221; (Head of Dept: Herve Le Guyader),
in the &#8220;Evolution and Development&#8221;
team. Dr Michael Manuel will be the supervisor of
the thesis. Starting date September 2007. Applicants
must have a strong background in zoology, and must be
familiar with the concepts and methods of phylogeny
and Evo-Devo. An experience with molecular biology
lab work will also be appreciated. Applicants must be
citizens of the European Union or associated countries.
The application ﬁle (single pdf ﬁle) will comprise: -
a complete CV (max 4 pages), with all details about
University studies and Master courses, and including a
presentation of the Master lab training and other lab
trainings, - a letter of motivation. All applications must
be sent by e-mail (Michael.Manuel@snv.jussieu.fr). The
application deadline is 25 April 2007. One referee
(e.g. the supervisor of a lab training) must send
a letter of appreciation on the applicant, by e-mail
to Michael.Manuel@snv.jussieu.fr, before the deadline.
Selected applicants will have to make an oral presenta-
tion on the 10th May 2007, in Paris.

UTuebingen ExperimentalEvol
PhD on Experimental host-parasite coevolution
The PhD project aims at a comprehensive experimental
test of the consequences of host-parasite co-evolution.
It is based on a selection experiment followed by ex-
tensive phenotypic and molecular analysis. The ap-
proach relies on a unique model system, consisting of
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a host and its
micro-parasite Bacillus thuringiensis, which are both
ideally suited to experimental analysis. The results of
this project are expected to have an impact on four bi-
ological research themes that are of particular current
interest: the animal innate immune system, bacterial
virulence, life-history trade-oﬀs, and the generation of
biological diversity.
The project is supervised by Dr. Hinrich Schulenburg
and funded by the German Science Foundation (SCHU
1415/5-1; position according to 13 TV-L/2). It is based
in the Department of Animal Evolutionary Ecology at
the University of T¨ ubingen, Germany. The department
is active in various ﬁelds of evolutionary ecology and it
provides an international and interactive atmosphere.
Requirements for the position: High motivation, ex-
cellent background in evolutionary ecology (especially
host-parasite evolution) and statistics, knowledge of
basic molecular techniques (PCR, fragment analysis),
handling of complex experimental set-up, teamwork,
ideally some experience with C. elegans or bacteria, ﬂu-
ency in English.
Please send applications with CV, brief statement of
research interests, and two references, as a pdf-ﬁle
by email to hinrich.schulenburg <at>uni-tuebingen.de.
Deadline for applications: 1st June 2007. Start of po-
sition: September 2007. Women are especially encour-
aged to apply. Severely handicapped people will be
preferentially considered in case of equivalent qualiﬁca-
tions. For further details + questions, send an email

UWyoming EvolGenetics
Position: Ph.D. research assistantship (starting fall
2007)
Project: Analytical tools for studies of the genomics of
isolation between plant taxa
A Ph.D. research assistantship is available in the
Buerkle lab at the University of Wyoming to work in
the area of evolutionary genetics and computational bi-
ology.
The goal of the research is to continue the development
of methods and software tools for the analysis of ge-
nomics of isolation between plant taxa. Initially we are
interested in developing tools for the study of hybrid
zones between Populus species and the movement of
genes between crop and wild sunﬂowers. The statisti-
cal methods will identify genes that are likely to expe-
rience divergent selection between taxa or that easily
cross boundaries between taxa. In addition, we will ad-
vance related methods and write software for admixture
mapping in natural populations.
This research assistantship is a good opportunity for a
student to gain skills in computational biology and sta-
tistical genetics in the context of interesting evolution-
ary questions. The central tasks for the assistantship
are computational, and applicants with experience in
computer programming, modeling and statistical anal-
ysis (R/S-Plus, Perl, C/C++, Maple/Mathematica,
etc.), or a demonstrated aptitude for and an interest
in learning skills of this type, will be preferred.
The position will begin in late August 2007 and is feder-
ally funded for three years (university funding for assis-
tantship thereafter). Review of applications will begin
1 May 2007 and will continue until the position is ﬁlled.
Preliminary inquiries are encouraged and should be
directed to Alex Buerkle (buerkle@uwyo.edu). Addi-
tional information about the lab, the University and
the position is available from http://www.uwyo.edu/

SmallMammals
Volunteer needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
July/August to Ovtober/November 2007
>From November 2007 onwards
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Whereas the research is
mainly non-invasive, this is no job for extreme animal
right persons (we take tissue and blood samples). Hard
working conditions will await applicants, as the study
species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock),
and stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
ﬁeld will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio- tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for the masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
500 (around 70 Euro) must be paid for accommodation
at the research station. Students must buy their own
food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 1500 or 200
Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect to34 EvolDir May 1, 2007
pay about 300 Euros per month. Students get an invi-
tation letter which they can use to apply for funding in
their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW in
Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: Currently we are looking for a vol-
unteer for the period July/August to October/ Novem-
ber 2007, the breeding season. The next open positions
will be December 2007 and January 2008.

ing academics at the Lecturer or Senior Lecturer level.
There is considerable overlap between these positions
as they are intended to build on and complement ex-
isting research strengths at UNSW. Applicants wishing
to apply for both positions should submit separate ap-
plications.
Position 4905 is an appointment in adaptive evolution-
ary biology. The appointee will be expected to build a

tive evolution, to teach in evolution, ecology and whole-
organism biology and to supervise honours and post-
graduate students with interests in adaptive evolution.
Preference may be given to applicants whose research
involves the experimental study of adaptation using
quantitative genetics, functional genomics, physiolog-
ical techniques and/or ecologically-relevant manipula-
tive experiments. Research should involve the testing
of evolutionary theory. Research programs that are
mostly descriptive (e.g. restricted to phylogeography,
systematics, taxonomy or population genetics) will not
be favoured.
Position 4906 is an appointment in behavioural ecology
and behavioural evolution. The appointee will be ex-
pected to build a research program in behavioural ecol-
ogy and evolution, to teach in animal behaviour, evolu-
tion, ecology and whole-organism biology and to super-
vise Honours and postgraduate students with interests

Allelic dropout
Dear EvolDir members,
I amplify macaque faecal DNA using human microsatel-
lite primers. In addition to the risk of contamination,
the chance of allelic dropout is high due to the degraded
condition of the source DNA. There are many reviews
that talk about many plans (e.g.Taberlet et al. 1999
and Pompanon et al. 2005 etc. ) and methods (e.g.multiple tube approach) to tackle this problem as a sub-
set of the whole genotyping error, but I was wondering
if there is any consensus in the scientiﬁc community
about the solution. Any other suggestion about pater-
nity study in macaques also will be appreciated.
Thank you in advance.

Dear Deb,
Without simplifying too much you can categorise all
microsatellite errors into two classes, stochastic (allelic
dropout, false alleles) and systematic (null alleles, con-
tamination). Given that you’re using DAN from faecesand primers from another species, you can expect to
have every type of error in your data.
I don’t know much about dealing with systematic errors
in paternity analysis but there is a review of the eﬀect of
null alleles (Dakin & Avise, Heredity 93:504-9). There
is also a parentage analysis program that deals with
null alleles (NewPatXL, available on Bill Amos’ website
http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/zoostaﬀ/amos ). For gen-
eral approaches to estimating null allele frequencies see
last Saturday’s evoldir post on null alleles and popula-
tion diﬀerentiation.
Regarding stochastic errors, I’m not sure if there’s a
consensus, but I think the best strategy is:
1. Clean the data by repeat-genotyping. How often?
You’ll never make it perfect so I’d say repeat as often as
possible without limiting the number of loci you type.
For example, in a typical study I suspect that repeat-
ing 10 loci 4 times will give you more informative data
than repeating 5 loci 8 times, even if the error rate is
high (providing your analysis method uses a realistic
error model - see below). There are also ways of target-
ing repeats on lower quality samples (qPCR: Wandeler
et al. Mol Ecol 12,1087-1093; statistical: Miller et al.
Genetics, 160, 357-366).
2. Estimate the residual error rate in your data. This
is typically done by duplicating a subset of your geno-
types. You’ll get most out of your data if your analysis
method (see below) can tell the diﬀerence between al-
lelic dropouts and false alleles, in which case you need to
estimate these rates separately. Dan Haydon and I have
written a method (Johnson & Haydon, Genetics 175,
827-842) and program ( http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/-
˜paulj/pedant.html ) for doing this.
3. Perform the parentage analysis, incorporating your
estimated error rate(s). The best approach to doing
this, particularly for data with frequent errors, is Had-
ﬁeld et al. Mol Ecol 15, 3715-3730. The program
(which is a package for R) estimates and adjusts for al-
lelic dropout and false allele rates, so you can skip step
2. There is also a sibship reconstruction method by Jin-
liang Wang (Colony, http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/ioz/-
software.htm, Genetics 166,1963-1979) that uses sepa-
rate error rates.
Good luck, Paul

I doubt a consensus will emerge for lcnDNA samples,May 1, 2007 EvolDir 41
since each study is so unique. Diﬀerent combinations
of sample type, marker, sample size, analysis method
and inference drawn will encounter unique challenges.
An easy solution is to repeat all specimens 8 times, but
this is not feasible, nor is it necessary, for all types of
studies.
The self-critical approach advocated by Gilbert et al
2005 (TREE 20, 541-544) is on the right track.

sequenced genomes have stumbled upon quite a few sur-
prises, including that only one to ten percent of the
genetic material of animals actually codes for genes.
What does the remaining 90-99% of the genome do?
Why do some organisms have a much lower genome
size than their close relatives? What were the genetic
changes that were associated with us becoming human?
As molecular biologists uncover these and other new
mysteries, evolutionary geneticists are searching for an-
swers to such questions. Norman Johnson captures
the excitement of the hunt for our own genetic history.
Through lively anecdotes, he explores how researchers
detect natural selection acting on genes and what this
genetic information tells us about human origins.

Dear Colleagues,
A couple of fellow evolutionary biologists have already
decided to join me for the Rarotonga (Cook Islands)
stop-over en route to the Evolution meeting. Ger-
ald McCormack, a local naturalist and the creator
of Cook Islands Biodiversity Heritage Trust ( http://-
cookislands.bishopmuseum.org ), will advise us on theMay 1, 2007 EvolDir 43
best ways to enjoy Rarotonga marine and terrestrial
life. I just noticed that AirNewZealand made CI
stopovers free and tickets are still available for June
10th ﬂight from LA to Rarotonga. So if anyone is still
considering joining us, it’s probably a good time to de-
cide. I am also going to decide on accommodations and
other details very soon.
Also still open for suggestions on after-the-meeting
hikes on South Island.

GMO FieldGuide
This is to announce the publication of an inexpensive
new ﬁeld guide that many evolutionary biologists and
geneticists may ﬁnd of special interest.
Written by John C. Avise, the book is entitled “A Field
Guide to Little Known Genetically Engineered Organ-
isms (Including Revisionary Interpretations about their
Impact on World History).
The author guides readers on a fascinating behind-the-
scenes journey into the little-known world of genetic
engineering, describing the ﬁeld marks, behaviors, and
geographic ranges for 35 of the world’s most top-secret
genetically engineered species. Also described are the
historical sagas and personal dramas behind each crea-
ture’s artiﬁcial manufacture. From Migratory Chickens
and Marijuana- sniﬃng Dogs to Fire-retardant Trees,
Square Tomotoes, and Oil- drinking Bacteria, the crea-
tures described in this richly illustrated ﬁeld guide give
new meaning to the old adage that ”ﬁction is stranger
than truth.“
The book is available from Pensoft Publishers ( http://

MY QUESTION
Dear All, is there some genetic software to measure ge-

Cristina, I’ve played with coding them as 1 (sequence
present) or 0 (sequence absent) or as multi-state char-
acters (where there are several discrete classes of the
same indel), and have used AMOVA to analyze sets of
indels, both along with and instead of nucleotide se-
quence diﬀerences for the coding sequence. There are
cases where they really help, and there are cases where
they work better than nucleotide substitutions (typi-
cally dominated by transitional changes) for phyloge-
netic reconstruction. This work is with colleagues who
are “just trying things out” and is not yet published,
as far as I know. The idea is free. It runs against tra-
ditional usage, but the point of the exercise is to ﬁgure
out the phylogeny, not be politically correct. - Peter

Many programs allow to specify indels as missing data
or as a character. Parsimony in Phylip by default uses
gaps as a character, PAUP by default has them as miss-
ing data. If one treats gaps as characters, larger gaps
sometimes are a problem, because each individual po-
sition is counted as a character. A solution is treat the
individual indel as missing data, and to
form additional (0/1) characters for the ab-
sence/presence of a gap.

Reed A. Cartwright
Do you want to include indels in the distance mea-
sure or do you want to estimate distance with an algo-
rithm that treats indels as something other than miss-ing data? I can do the latter with my current research
project. However, if the former is what you are after,
then I caution against it because it would involve nearly
arbitrary choices about how to weight indels and indel
lengths with respect to substitutions.
In my work I use substitutions to establish evolution-
ary distance and calculate the proportion of indels per
substitution. I feel that this is the proper way to do it.
Email me if you are interested in my approach.

Genographer software answers
Other: Genographer.software.ANSWERS
Hi, Evol-Dir,
Here is my original post...
Hi Evol-Dir, I would like to use the program Genog-
rapher to analyze ﬂuorescent AFLP data using 5 dyes
(6FAM, VIC, NED, PET, and the size standard LIZ)
run on an ABI 3730 machine. The latest version
of Genographer http://hordeum.oscs.montana.edu/-
genographer/ <http://hordeum.oscs.montana.edu/-
genographer/ >does not recognize the LIZ (orange)
dye, and thus cannot be used for data with more
than 4 dyes. A Google search brought up an
abstract ( http://www.intl-pag.org/13/abstracts/-
PAG13 P229.html <http://www.intl-pag.org/13/-
abstracts/PAG13 P229.html >) regarding a modiﬁca-
tion to the software that would allow analysis of this
data, however I have not had any luck with follow up
emails to the abstract authors or to other colleagues.
If anyone has written a modiﬁcation to update Genog-
rapher and is willing to share it, or knows who to con-
tact, please let me know.
Thanks for your help, Heidi
..And here are the two relevant emails I received in
response to this (see below). The “unoﬃcial” update
to Genographer does exist (see email #1 below from
Ben Sikes) however it requires yet another program
that is no longer supported as an intermediary (GeneS-
can). The other response (see email #2 below fromMay 1, 2007 EvolDir 45
Walter Durka) was a bit more promising, as it appears
that Travis Blake is in fact developing a new version of
Genographer that will import ﬂuorescent AFLP proﬁles
directly without having to use GeneScan. Genographer
2.0 can be downloaded now, but it is apparently not
working on data with 5 dyes (yet).
A number of other emails suggested other pro-
grams I might try for scoring AFLPs (includ-
ing PeakScanner, a new free program from ABI:
www.appliedbiosystems.com/PeakScanner <http:/-
/www.appliedbiosystems.com/PeakScanner >). For
those interested, we have outlined a number of AFLP
programs in Table 1 of a recent paper:

I had a similar problem and did manage to get in con-
tact with the guys who wrote that abstract. They gave
me this message and the conversions worked ﬁne on
Genographer. Unfortunately the problem was that the
3730 ﬁles go straight into Genemapper and then are not
usable in Genographer as it uses the Genescan data. In
the end everyone in our groups has been ’pigeon-holed’
into using Genemapper because ABI has monopolized
how their data can be used... at least for now. Sorry
for the bad news and I hope this helps.

Help CreateEvol Debate thanks
Thanks to all who have forwarded suggestions, advice,
encouragement and even warnings to me about my
upcoming debate with Young Earth Creationist Terry
Mortenson.
Many of you have oﬀered rich and current examples
of mutations that can be argued to have met the two
criteria set forth in his question. Namely a) does it rep-
resent an increase in information and b) does it result
in a new or novel function.
If you read the Answers in Genesis webpage (which I
have extensively) you will see that they have already
anticipated some of the obvious and favorite examples
oﬀered, namely that alleles that result in sickle cell ane-
mia can oﬀer some protection against malaria.

Lepidoptera Evol Database
Dear AllI have already written to a number of you individually
regarding a proposal we are writing to develop Butter-
ﬂyBase into a genomic and organismal database for the
Lepidoptera. This is a joint initiative with David Heckel
in Jena and Owen McMillan and NESCent in Duke Uni-
versity. Over the long term we believe there is a need to
establish a Lepidoptera-wide database which will pro-
cess and link genomic sequences, ecological and molec-
ular data in a fashion which will make gene-hunting
easier. The establishment of a community-wide portal
for accessing data comparable to FlyBase must surely
be a priority for us as a community. The aim is initially
to complement what is already available at SpodoBase,
KaikoBase, and SilkDB, although if there is a commu-
nity consensus the eventual aim would be a single web
portal for lepidopteran comparative genomics and an-
notation. We are currently talking to EBI about host-
ing, but would mirror the site other areas (e.g. Asia
and US) and, and the site could be given a general title
(LepBase or LepGen springs to mind). Our grant pro-
posal will develop only some of these goals, but diﬀer-
ent labs will contribute to diﬀerent aspects, in a man-
ner similar to the development of FlyBase. For our
part, we have been invited to submit a proposal to the
Bioinformatics and Biological Resources Fund from the
BBSRC (a UK research council) to update Butterﬂy-
Base and convert it to the CHADO schema (this is the
generic model organism database used by FlyBase et al-
seewww.gmod.org ). ButterﬂyBase ( www.gmod.org )
already hosts all publicly available Lepidopteran EST
sequences in a clustered and annotated format. How-
ever, we believe, that it is time to move this to the next
level and this requires community involvement.
If you feel able to support this proposal, would you be
able to write a one page letter of support that addresses
the following points:
State who you are, where you work, what sort of re-
search you do, and who funds it Are you satisﬁed with
the current availability of resources for Lepidopteran
genomics and bioinformatics? Do you think there is a
need for an international LepGen database? State in
general what you think the major requirements would
be If you agree with the concept behind LepGen, can
you express your support for this BBSRC proposal?
Would the funding of this BBSRC proposal and the
establishment of LepGen stimulate additional funding
opportunities for Lepidopteran and Arthropod bioin-
formatics in your country or community? The deadline
for our proposal is 1 May.
We look forward to hearing from you

MHC CloningArtefacts answers
Hello Evoldir members, a few weeks ago I posted a ques-
tion about MHC and cloning artefacts and I got a lot
of really good answers which made it possible for me
to solve the problem. So many thanks to you all that
answered me and took your time, it was really helpful!
Below my question I made a summary of most of the
answers.
Please feel free to write to me if you have any more
useful suggestions or any questions!
Best regards / Erik
email: hageri@kth.se
My questions was:
Hello,
I read the discussion about MHC and cloning artefacts
and I found it very interesting as I have a similar prob-
lem with very puzzling results. I study MHC in dogs
(DLA) and to get the alleles in heterozygote individuals
I use cloning (I use the GeneJET cloning kit K1221from
Fermentas). The problem is that I sometimes get more
than two alleles per individual, sometimes as many as
six diﬀerent alleles in one single individual! This prob-
lem has occurred in around 50 % of the samples in each
cloning and the incorrect ones diﬀer every time and
do not occur in speciﬁc individuals. Some of these al-
leles do not correspond to the diploid sequence at all
(for example when the diploid ABI sequence indicates
a T and G as a double peak, the cloned sequence in-
dicates a clear C). Things that I have already done to
avoid problems are the following (some are the same
as the suggestions mentioned in answers in the discus-
sion): * HPLC puriﬁed primer. However, the diﬀer-
ences between the alleles are not where the primers an-
neal but in between the annealing sites, so the artefacts
can not be due to the imperfect synthesis of primers.
* I use Platinum Taq DNA polymerase from Invitro-
gen with high ﬁdelity, which should generate few mis-incorporated bases. However, the diﬀerences between
the alleles are anyway far too many to be explained by
mutations caused by the polymerase (at least accord-
ing the ratio I know of, around 0.0006). * The PCR
product should be pure as I use a nested PCR with two
diﬀerent primer pairs which should enhance the purity.
* Contamination should not be a problem as I work
in a special lab-room which is more or less DNA free.
The diploid ABI sequences only shows two peaks at the
polymorphic sites and one peak at the other sites and
no indication of contamination between the samples.
So, with that said, what should I do? I read one
comment where recombination between the E.coli were
mentioned as a possible cause and that one should use
a low or non recombinant strain to avoid this. I use
a strain called RRI&#61508;M15. At least one of the
artefact alleles looks as a recombinant of two other al-
leles. Is there anyone that knows how common this
problem is and if this really can cause so many artefacts
as in my case? Could recombination be the problem?
Or what other factor could cause this problem that I
have??
And when I am writing, I will add a related question.
How important is it to purify the PCR product when
one is working with MHC genes and could puriﬁcation
improve sequence quality and reduce background sig-
nals?
I will be very grateful for all suggestions that could help
me. I will put a summary of the answers on evoldir in
a few weeks.
The answers were:
1.
the problems you describe are most likely PCR-errors
introduced by the polymerase. Even the best proof-
reading polymerase introduce enough errors that you
ﬁnd in clones, and the fact, that you can not reproduce
the artifacts from the same sample hints to that. I had
similar ﬁndings when cloning single copy genes: 1. base
exchanges, normally found in only single clones (“back-
ground noiose”), 2. other exchanges, that were common
among clones and ﬁtted with double peaks from direct
sequencing (the real “alleles”). and 3. in very rare cases
chimeric clones, that starts with sequences of one allele
and ends with the other (Recombination during PCR:
if in some rare cases elongation of a primer does not go
over the reverse primer, the resulting fragment could in
theory anneal to a a template of the other allele in the
next cycle and produce a mixture of both alleles).
The only chance I see to reduce such errors are: 1. Re-
duce the cycles in your PCRs to a minimum and 2.
Do not use a nested PCR (try to design more speciﬁc48 EvolDir May 1, 2007
primers, if necessary).
When you try this and ﬁnd that errors are reduced you
can be sure, the problems were due to PCR-errors.
2.
I would hazard to guess that you might have a series
of tandem duplications, although I don’t know the dog
genome sequence that well. But even if there is genomic
sequence available, for complex regions like MHC, ini-
tial draft genomic sequence is not very reliable for infer-
ring these type of issues, especially if it not from your
speciﬁc animal.
I would try using some technique to get out into the
5’ or 3’ genomic sequence ﬂanking your genes to see
what is happening. Also, try PCRing with a very long
extension time and see if

ML DNA partitioning

I’m looking for a phylogenetic reconstruction program
implementing Maximum Likelihood which allows DNA
data to be partitioned with diﬀerent DNA substitution
parameters (i.e. diﬀerent models for diﬀerent genes, in

Micro HWEquilibrium answers
Hi all:
Thanks to all who give me theirs sonsideration about
the HWE problem. A lot of people ask me about the
answers, here I send some of them... Regards Rodrigo
If you have microsat loci not showing H-W proportions
you should be aware whether you have a relatively high
amount of not-detected alleles (“null-alleles)giving you
a surplus of homozygotes. Bo
yes, this can be a problem. It depends on why they are
out of HWE, how much, and in what direction. Null al-
leles, Wahlund eﬀect, (selection - unlikely on more than
a very few loci)? There is quite a lot of literature on
this. You might have seen the recent Evoldir posting
about null alleles (question raised by Mike Ritchie) that
covered a lot of it, including Selkoe & Toonen (2006).
Paul
If you use software such as Cervus or Famoz for parent-
age analysis you can take into account the H-W dise-
quilibrium. These softwares are able work with a level
of H-W disequilibrium you can choose. I enjoy to see
all the answers you will receive. Pascal
I think it will depend on which kind of parentage anal-
ysis are you doing. If you are using full exclusion I do
not see why it should aﬀect. If you are using a likeli-
hood approach it will propably aﬀect but it might not
be to much trouble if the departure from HW is not
big. Miguel
I think it depend on why they aren’t in HWE. One
reason might be null alleles. If this is the case, doing
paternity/maternity analysis might be quite challeng-
ing. On the other hand, if some loci are out of HWE
due to more biological causes (migration etc., ) then
there shouldn’t be much of a problem. Can you tell if
you have more or fewer than the expected number of
heterozygotes? Too few can be a sign of null alleles.
For other questions like estimating gene ﬂow, many peo-May 1, 2007 EvolDir 49
ple include a locus or two that are out of HWE. I’m
not sure this is a good practice, but many of us have
chosen this path, rather eliminating the locus from the
data set. Jeﬀ
Absolutely! H-W equilibrium is certainly an assump-
tion of most parentage determination methods. While
I’m not an expert on all the details of each parentage es-
timation method, I know for a fact that H-W genotype
frequencies are assumed for exclusion analyses. Viola-
tion of H-W means that the frequency of genotypes is
not just the product of the allele frequencies. Usually
homozygotes are more frequent and heterozygotes less
frequenct than expected under H-W. I work with a tree
species where individuals self about 10% of the time.
Therefore mating is not random and H-W should not
be met exactly. Null alleles at microsatellite loci can
also lead to violation of H-W. In principle, it is possible
to adjust expected genotype frequencies for increased
autozygosity but I am unaware of any program that
does this automatically. You should also think about
the consequences of violation of the H-W assumption
when interpreting your data even if you cannot adjust
for it exactly. Good luck, Matt
You should probably start by reading: Hoﬀman JI, and
Amos W (2005) Microsatellite genotyping errors: de-
tection approaches, common sources and consequences
for paternal exclusion. Molecular Ecology 14, 599-612.
A,thoug it doesn’t really touch on H-W equilibrium
problems it is possible that there might be diﬃcul-
ties. Nobody has really assessed this problem in full. If
your interest is paternity or genealogy construction you
could look up Fernandez and Toro 2006 manuscript on
a new software for genealogy construction that doesn’t

Microarray of other species
Aloha Folks,
We are just about to start an expression array study us-
ing the completed genome sequence for a species that
is not the focal species for our study. I would like to
hear from folks who have used slides spotted with oli-
gos derived from the sequence of a species other than
the one they are studying. It seems to me that, with
long enough oligos (we are going to use 60-mers), a
pretty distant relative (or at least their DNA) could be
hybridized against the slide but I would like to hear
from people who have actually tried it including how
distant their focal species was from the array’d species.
How did the hybridization work across the slide. Did
the annealing stringency have to be lowered so much
for some spots that the higher identity genes got signal
swamp-out?
Many thanks (Mahalo nui) for your help.

MrBayes DataPartition
Dear all,
I have encountered a problem when I tried to partition
data using Mrbayes. I have 60 genes and I try to par-
tition them by genes and codon positions. When the50 EvolDir May 1, 2007
partitioning number was less than 150, it worked, but
if I used the full 180 partitions, I got the error message
said “could not ﬁnd a division for character devision
1” and crushed. I wonder if any of you have the same
experiences. Does a limit exist for the total number
of partitions that you can use in Mrbayes? Thanks in
advance.

Dear Robert,
If the alignment is diﬃcult (many indels), we start with
Clustal, which you can use on the web or download free.
We ﬁnish the alignment and check it in MacClade (not
free but worth the price), where we use the nice color
view to check and ﬁne-tune the alignment by hand.
MacClade will also translate the sequences, and for
protein-coding genes it is best to align the amino acid
sequences ﬁrst. Indels due to sequencing artefacts are
quickly spotted as frameshifts.
I’l guessing that there is freeware that you can use to
translate, color, and align sites, although it presumbly
won’t do all the other things that MacClade does.May 1, 2007 EvolDir 51
For rDNA it is best to take secondary structure into
account when doing the alignment, but that is a whole
diﬀerent problem which others can tell you more about.
We are only just getting started on it.
Good luck!

Nulls and pop structure answers
Very many thanks to all those who replied to my query
about null alleles and population structure. I had
around 50 answers, which is testament to the extent
of the problem.
Shortly before my submission Chapuis & Estoup pub-
lished a simulation of the eﬀects of various ways of esti-
mating the frequency of “the” null allele and adjusting
Fst estimates. They have also developed software to do
this, which will surely become an essential resource to
many:
Chapuis & Estoup 2007. Microsatellite null alleles and
estimation of population diﬀerentiation. Mol. Biol.
Evol. 24: 621-631.
http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/URLB/ Cock van
Oosterhout’s MICROCHECKER (the current version
is a major update from the last time I looked) applies
one of these and is available here:
http://www.microchecker.hull.ac.uk/ van Oosterhout,
C., D. Weetman, and W. F. Hutchinson. 2006. Esti-
mation and adjustment of microsatellite null alleles in
nonequilibrium populations. Mol Ecol Notes 6:255-256.
So, if you are prepared to live with the assumptions of
these (the main ones being that your problem is due
to a single null, and no Wahlund eﬀects) there is great
scope for Fst-style analyses.
A nice surprise to me is that an imminent release of
STRUCTURE allows treating loci as dominant markers
so allowing analyses of potential sub-structure despite
nulls. This is not available yet, but is to be released
soon on the STRUCTURE website and Daniel Falush
and colleagues have a paper (again, just out) in MEN
on this.

worth mentioning here that there are also methods for
relatedness and parentage:

bypass many of them, but I have compiled most of theanswers here:

two nice quotes:
My instincts are to think a lot about the data, keep
your eye on the biology and total evidence, and be pre-
pared to argue your case with editors. Sometimes they
are unreasonable, but that can happen on any issue. -

If we combine our problems, maybe there is food for an
article “S.O.S. - Save Our Samples: survival guide to
get the best out of the worst”. This might get a lot of
citations. - Dieter Anseeuw

PAUP 4 0 in OSX
I just bought a used Mac G4 PowerBook running OSMay 1, 2007 EvolDir 53
X (v. 3.9). I thought PAUP 4.0 would run in Classic
mode, but when I drag the PAUP font ﬁle from my old
G3 desktop to the “Classic” system folder, it disappears
the minute I let go of the mouse button. This happens
no matter where I try and drop the ﬁle. PAUP asks for
this ﬁle as it opens, and will not run without ﬁnding it.
Has anyone ﬁgured out a work around for this?

Plant genomic DNA extraction Kits
answers
Dear Evoldir,
I promise many of you I would post the replies to myquery about alternative DNA extraction Kits for plants.
I did received some very useful replies and they are post
anonymously bellow.
However, given there didn’t seem to be enough evi-
dence in direct comparisons I went ahead and order
samples of a few kits to compare them myself. We
tried DNEasy from Qiagen, Nucleospin from Macherey-
Nagel, EZNA by Omega BioTek (sold by VWR),
and the ChargeSwitch from Invitrogen (magnetic-bead
based).
Bear in mind that we were using these kits in Arabidop-
sis which is a fairly benevolent plant to extract DNA,
some of these might work quite diﬀerently in species
that have lots of secondary compounds. Still, we found
the same as some of the repliers told me: They all seem
to work equally well.
We ampliﬁed PCR products and digest all samples with
the same eﬃciency. The Nucleospin kit gave the high-
est yield but it is as expensive as the Qiagen, the EZNA
is the cheapest and has comparable yields with the
Qiagen. However, we were quite impressed with the
ChargeSwitch. We haven’t use the magnetic beads be-
fore, and they seem much easier to do, and harder to
have students mess up the protocol. It also requires less
centrifugation, which can be a plus in some situations.
There are other companies that have magnetic beads
kits now (including the EZNA) but we have not tried
their kits. They might be worth giving a try.
Some repliers suggest that DNA extracted with diﬀer-
ent methods might have diﬀerent shelf-life. This can
be an important factor in some situations, but at the
moment we can’t comment on that.
Hope this is useful! And sorry it took me so long!
Paula
Replies:
“I used to work with Qiagen’s kit, but recently switched
to EZNA’s kit for two reasons. First it was a price
issue, EZNA’s kit cots about 1/4 to 1/3 or Qiagen.
Second, the company marketing the EZNA kit here in
Sweden were pretty aggressive and directly targeted Qi-
agen users (they used to represent Qiagen but Qiagen
decided to take over the distribution themselves). The
end result is that our local chemistry store at the uni-
versity now always stock the EZNA kit, meaning that
we can always get a new kit within minutes without
having to order and wait for a week or so to get it.
We haven’t experienced any noticeable drop in DNA
quality with EZNAs kit, although I think the yield for
the EZNA kit might be a little lower (10-15% or so)
than Qiagen’s kit. We’ve also switched over to EZNA’s54 EvolDir May 1, 2007
PCR purifying kit, where we also used to work with Qi-
agen’s kit. Again the performance is about the same.”
——-
“ I have compared both kits. Some of my students are
able to get very good results witht he EZNA kits. The
other half have prefered to continue with the Qiaquick
kits.
The EZNA kits do not have the same eﬃciency as the
Qiaquick kits. So if you are working with limited DNA
samples they may not be so good for you. In addition
they don’t seem to purify as well as the Qiaquick. How-
ever if you have lots of DNA and a robust PCR protocol
the EZNA kits would be ﬁne.”
——
“The best method we used was after extraction perform
an ethanol precipitation then the EZNA columns and
that improves their puriﬁcation ability enormously we
did not ﬁgure a way to increase the eﬃciancy of the
recovery except to concentrate the DNA afterwards.”
—–
“Depending on the plant, you might be able to dis-
pense with kits entirely. We do a high-throughput
(2 96 well plates at a time, takes about 3 hours)
CTAB/chloroform extraction with Mimulus that pro-
duces plentiful DNA of ﬁne quality for sequencing and
genotyping. It’s a little ﬁddly and you need good equip-
ment (a Genogrinder or some other way to grind the
tissue in 96well format, a deep bucket rotor centrifuge,
a Matrix 1250 extended tip pipettor – the same stuﬀ
Qiagen recommends for it’s 96-well plant DNEasy kits),
but it is essentially free after that. We’ve had success
with some other taxa using this protocol or variations
(Silene, Solanum, leaf-eating
beetles) but some things with high secondaries (oaks,
composites) yield lots of DNA but also end up with stuﬀ
coming through that inhibits PCR. Anyway, something
to think about it you are looking at extracting thou-
sands of samples on a regular basis.”
—-
“One of my friends uses the wizard kits (I can get the
brand name if you need). He doesn’t think the DNA
comes out as clean as with Qiagen kits but he thinks
he get a higher yield from them.”
—–
“Most of these kits are largely the same. If you would
really like to save money, please see the attached pro-
tocol that we published this month - we compared it
directly to Qiagen.http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/-

SNP Heterozygote excess answers
Thanks to everyone who wrote me suggesting possi-

counter within some of my SNP loci.
Some of these answers:
Original massage Other: Heterozygote excess with SNP
markers
Dear EvolDir members,
I’m working on the population genetics of seagrass,
Zostera marina, using SNP loci. When I analyse
the genotypic data for some natural populations I en-
counter high HWE departures. Some of the loci, espe-
cially some loci that are linked to each other in three
diﬀerent regions, have a high heterozygote excess. Some
populations consist only of heterozygotes (sample size
between 15-32). Based on the available msat data of
these individuals, clones were excluded from SNP geno-
typing and subsequent data analysis. I’m not awareMay 1, 2007 EvolDir 55
of any paper that encounters similar HWE departures.
Does any of you encounter similar problems or does any
of you have an idea what the cause could be?
Any suggestions and tips will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

one from each other so that you obtain (A/B,C/D) and
(E/F,G/H). Of course, I guess that a few generations of
crosses among them will put all that at Hardy Weinberg
unless mating isn’t allowed between speciﬁc lineages.
Another, maybe more ’naturally realistic’ explanation

SNP analysis
Hi everyone,
I am in the process of genotyping SNPs as an alternative
marker for the population genetic analysis of abalone.
Could someone advise me on how the raw data should
be processed in Excel (1& 3 for homozygotes, 2 for het-
erozygotes???) and then what population genetic soft-
ware are currently favoured for SNPs analysis.
Thank you in advance Aletta Bester Genetics Univer-

SNP heterozygote excess
Other: Heterozygote excess with SNP markers
Dear EvolDir members,
I’m working on the population genetics of seagrass,
Zostera marina, using SNP loci. When I analyse
the genotypic data for some natural populations I en-
counter high HWE departures. Some of the loci, espe-
cially some loci that are linked to each other in three
diﬀerent regions, have a high heterozygote excess. Some
populations consist only of heterozygotes (sample size
between 15-32). Based on the available msat data of
these individuals, clones were excluded from SNP geno-
typing and subsequent data analysis. I’m not aware
of any paper that encounters similar HWE departures.
Does any of you encounter similar problems or does any
of you have an idea what the cause could be?
Any suggestions and tips will be greatly appreciated.

Silene nutans samples
Dear all,
I am working on a research project concerning the study
of the phylogeography of Silene nutans (Caryophyl-
laceae) in Europe, in collaboration with Pascal Touzet
and Solenn Le Cadre of the Lab. of Genetics and
Evolution of Plant Populations (University of Lille1,
France). During the last 15 years, I have been col-
lecting leaf material or seeds in more than 100 popula-
tions fromBelgium, France, Sweden (and northern Fin-
land),which can now beused for DNA analysis. This
year we plan to collect(or we will receivematerial) from
British populations. Silene nutans has a quite wide
continental distribution in Europe, so we would like to
extend your sampling area, especially to the east (and
to complete the northern distribution). Anyonewho
could help us by collectingseeds and capsules (for 5-
10 maternal plants)in wild populationsof Silene nutans
is welcome and can contact me for more information.

Software DAMBE
Dear All,
I have just uploaded a new version of DAMBE that
ﬁxed a few bugs in a few phylogenetic functions and
also included the functions for RNA folding from the
Vienna package. A sample ﬁle (CowtRNA.FAS) is in-
cluded for you to learn the new functions.
1. To explore RNA folding, read in CowtRNA.FAS and
click “Graphics |Plot RNA secondary structure”. The
ﬁrst sequence folded with the default parameters is dis-
played. The available options are self-explanatory, es-May 1, 2007 EvolDir 57
pecially for those who have already used the Vienna
package. Click another sequence on the list will plot
the secondary structure of that sequence.
To paste the structure into PowerPoint or any other
software supporting graphics, you have two options
(BMP ﬁle or Windows enhanced metaﬁle). To paste
the BMP image, ﬁrst click “Edit |Copy image as BMP
ﬁle” when the structure is displayed, and then click
Paste when you are in PowerPoint. Transfer windows
enhanced metaﬁle needs one extra step. First you click
“Edit |copy image as Windows enhanced metaﬁle” when
the structure is displayed, then then click ’Paste’ in
PowerPoint. At this point you will only see four small
circular dots on the slide. Just click “Draw |ungroup”
will plot the secondary strucutre in PowerPoint. Win-
dows metaﬁle allows you to produce graphics of any
resolution and you can ungroup the graphic elements
and do whatever modiﬁcations you wish.
2. The functions in the Vienna package also improved
the previous function for predicting tRNA anticodon
loop under the menu ’Seq.Analysis |tRNA anticodon
and AC loop’.
3. Sometimes one may want to build a tree based
on structural similarities. This is done by clicking
“Phylogenetics |Tree with unaligned sequences |distance
based on RNA secondary strucutre”. Everything
follows is self-explanatory. THIS FUNCTION IS
VERY SLOW WITH LONG SEQUENCES BECAUSE
IT NEEDS TO DO THE FOLDING, ALIGN THE
STRUCTURES, AND COMPUTE THE EDIT DIS-
TANCES WHICH ARE THEN MODIFIED TO GEN-
ERATE A TREE.

US passports
I just learned that if you are a US citizen attend-
ing a scientiﬁc meeting outside the US (now including58 EvolDir May 1, 2007
Canada and Mexico) and your passport needs to be re-

regulations requiring passports for trips to Canada and
Mexico; so apply as early as possible.
If you are organizing a symposium it would be a good
idea to warn your US participants.
(Apparently it is not diﬃcult to get into Canada and

Working with multiple copy genes
answers
Dear Evoldir members
Thanks to all of you that have answered my question
about working with multiple copy genes for population
genetics. Below I have compiled the mails I got in re-May 1, 2007 EvolDir 59
sponse. In short, it seems that the conclusion is that
even low-copy genes are a pain in the neck, and the
best way is to try to develop locus-speciﬁc primers to
amplify just one of the paralogs. The problem of false
recombinants appearing during PCR ampliﬁcation fur-
ther complicates the issue. There are useful references
in the answers.
Best regards
Xavier
The original question:
Hi everyone
We have been working in population genetics with sev-
eral invertebrate groups. In an eﬀort to develop new
sequence-based markers, not just the usual mitochon-
drial genes, we have been doing sequencing work on
nuclear genes (both introns and exons). We are ﬁnding
in many cases that our target genes are multiple copy
genes. Although the number of copies is low (nothing to
do with rRNA genes, for instance) and probably there
is some concerted evolution, when we clone the ampli-
ﬁcation products we end up with several alleles in most
individuals.
My question is, what can we do with these data?
cloning represents a lot of eﬀort and I wonder if it is
worth it. This kind of data violates assumptions for
most analyses for phylogeny, phylogeography or pop-
ulation genetics. The concept of homgygosis or het-
erozygosis breaks down. They cannot be treated as
polyploid, either, as the diﬀerent copies are paralogous.
Hence, diﬀerent copies may follow diﬀerent evolution-
ary models. To further complicate the issue, often the
diﬀerent copies are close together in chromosomes, so
recombination is possible both intragene and intergene.
We can calculate some sort of “haplotype frequency”
based on the diﬀerent sequence types found in the
clones but then, can we legitimally use these estimates
in popgen programs? are there any program that can
handle this information, or any published reference?
Any hint will be appreciated. I will of course compile
and post the answers to the whole list.
Best regards
The answers:
Hi Xavier, Depening on whether you can distinguish (at
the sequence level) diﬀerent alleles per locus and diﬀer-
ent loci in each pcr, my suggestion would be to run the
primers you have already designed on a few individuals,
clone and sequence all alleles/loci from each and from
there design gene speciﬁc primers. then use these in all
your individuals. good luck! –markMark A. Chapman mchapman@plantbio.uga.edu

littlebritain Dear Xavier, Are you sure the loci
are in multiple copy? Or are you simply getting more
than just the expected 2 loci per individual? That also
happens due to cloning artifacts. Chimeras between
alleles can be created during ampliﬁcation and then
isolated during cloning and sequencing. Are you using
a PCR+1 protocol for cloning? In my experience,
and I too have cloned non-rDNA nuclear loci, cloning
artifacts are extremely common - they happened
everytime until I started using PCR+1. Once I did
that the number of alleles became 2. The drawback is
that PCR+1 is a lot of work. But for pop. gen. it is a
must.
Brieﬂy, in PCR+1 you start-up by using a lot of one of
the primers and 1/10 as much of the other (by the way,
you have to use a proof reading polymerase - we use
Easy-A because it also generates T overhangs and then
we use TOPO-TA kit). You then do 1 last PCR cycle
in which you add the primer that was in short supply
but that primer has been modiﬁed so it has a RE cut
site (a 10 bp tail is added with a restriction site).
After that last cycle, you clone the PCR products, amp
a bunch of clones (using primers in the vector), clean
them, and cut them with the restriction enzyme. Only
sequence the ones that do cut. That means they were
generated in that last cycle using the new primer and
are not the result of priming by unﬁnished fragments
(which generates the chimeras).

Why don’t you try to make gene-trees for each gene, us-
ing the inferred haplotypes? The pseudogenes should
form a cluster separate from the real genes, and you
should be able to, at least for the exons, ﬁgure out
which ones are real and pseudo, by looking for indels
and stop-codons. If the pseudo ones are distant enough,
you will probably not have to do much cloning, just
enough to conﬁrm your ﬁndings.

mtDNA ambiguous sites answers
Thanks to everyone who wrote me suggesting possible
approaches to mtDNA ambiguous sequences (hetero-
plasmy or other). Some of these answers:
1) Have you considered the possibility that you have
ampliﬁed Numts (nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA
fragments) along with your mitochondrial DNA? I have
found Numts in beetle genomic DNA before. One
way to get around the problem is to amplify a larger
mtDNA fragment (for example, half of the mitochon-
drial genome). Most (but not all!) Numts consist in rel-
atively short fragments. Therefore, amplifying a larger
fragment often allows to get rid of the nuclear copies.
Patrick
2) Hi, most probably you’re not facing heteroplasmy
(which es extremely rare in animals) but rather co-
ampliﬁcation of nuclear pseudogenes (numts). Its a
pretty nasty job to get rid of them, mainly playing
around with primers, PCR conditions or doing long-
PCR reactions making advantage that neuclear inser-
tions are rather short. You should really consider
cloning at least a few samples to get clean seqs; a se-
quence analysis checking nonsynonymous substitutions,
indels, damaged ORFs, GC content,... should guide you
to the authentic mtDNA seq and may help in primer
development. See the refs below, mainly that one of
Thalman et al, for some hints.
Which beetle are you working on and which primers did
you use? regards, Wolfgang Bensasson D., Zhang D.X.,

iﬀf.boku.ac.at 3) Hi, Fotini Are you shure that the
results are not caused by the presense of pseudogenes
inthe nucleus? Are the problems present in both
genes or only one of them and incases where there
is only a single diﬀerence have you checked taht it
does notresult in a stop codon which could clearly
indicate that it was pseudogenes. Kind regards, Søren
4) Answer: Your problem may be with nuclear copies
of the mtDNA rather than with mtDNA heteroplasmy.
If you can determine the nuclear sequence, you may be
able to “subtract” it from the hetero sequence. There
are also other possible solutions. See: Sorenson, M.D.
& T.W. Quinn. 1998. Numts: A challenge for avian
systematics and population biology. The Auk 115:
214-221. Sorenson, M.D. & R.C. Fleischer. 1996. Mul-
tiple independent transpositions of mitochondrial DNA
control region sequences to the nucleus. Proceedings of
the National Academy of Science USA 93:15239-15243.
Question: Thank you very much for your response.
I already read your papers but I dont think that I
have ampliﬁed Numts. When I checked for amino
acid changes in these sites I only found synonymous
mutations and no stop codons. Additionally DNA was
extracted for tissue very rich in muscle (beetle legs).
What do you think about it? Is it enough to exclude
Numts case? Answer: In general, I’d say that the above
is not suﬃcient evidence. The example highlighted in
our 1998 paper is one where a numt was ampliﬁed from
muscle tissue. Even if you have a very high ratio of
mtDNA to nuclear copies, you can still amplify the nu-
clear copy if the primers you are using match the nu-
clear sequence better. As for the patterns of change, I
would expect most substitutions between mtDNA and
a recently evolved numt to be 3rd position transitions.
The reason is that the numt evolves more slowly (given
better DNA repair mechanisms in the nucleus), such
that most of the change represent subsequent substitu-
tions in the mtDNA copy. As a next step, I would ﬁrst
ask about your primers. Are they “universal” primers
developed from other species? Do the primers incorpo-
rate degenerate sites to accommodate likely variation

mtDNA data analysis
Other: mtDNA data analysese
Dear EvolDir members, based on mtDNA sequence
data, I found very high levels of haplotype diversity
(h>0.8) and very low nucleotidic diversity in local sam-
ples of a sea urchin and no clear geographic patterns are
evident. I am wondering whether it is possible to apply
a Bayesian assignment test to mtDNA sequence data
in order to give insight on population genetic struc-
turing. At my knowledge, the only program handling
sequence data for this purpose is STRUCTURE, but
its use for sequence data is not recommended by the
authors. It can be used only for purely exploratory
analyses. Any suggestions and tips will be greatly ap-
preciated. Thanks ciao

In order to verify the origin of these ambiguities (nu-

in evolutionary biology understood in its widest sense.
Recent work highlights the need to combine both mor-
phological and molecular approaches even for a rela-
tively well-known group like drosophila. Besides the
value of the taxonomy itself, biosystematics also in-
volves an understanding of the phylogenetic relation-
ships between species in order to propose evolution-
ary scenarios retracing their history. Obtaining reliable
phylogenies is central in comparative studies, where the
aim is to understand, for instance, the origin and na-
ture of adaptations and the moment they occurred dur-
ing species diversiﬁcation. Such an approach, devel-
oped over many years in the laboratory, particularly by
Daniel Lachaise, is at the heart of a series of ongoing re-
search programmes involving several researchers in the
lab. The research project is centered around evaluating
the role of insularity and fragmentation of continental
habitats in the distribution of certain groups of species
especially in the southwestern Indian Ocean.
The candidate must be experienced in morphological
and molecular systematics (any kind of organisms).
This means a knowledge and the capability of having acritical approach of all the tools required for morpho-
logical and molecular analyses and especially those used
for phylogenetical reconstruction. The candidate must
also be interested in bio- and phylogeography. More-
over, he/she must have the capacity and willingness to
conduct ﬁeld work especially in Madagascar.

erences) should be mailed to : Marie-Louise

Diversity of sex determination in ﬁsh: functional ge-
netic analysis of sex chromosomes in the platyﬁsh
Xiphophorus maculatus.
- Description of the project In contrast to the situa-
tion observed in mammals and birds, sex determination
is hypervariable and evolves extremely rapidly in ﬁsh.
This variability is potentially associated with the for-May 1, 2007 EvolDir 63
mation of new master sex-determining genes and new
sex chromosomes. Hence, ﬁsh represent an outstanding
model for the study of the evolution of sex determina-
tion, sex chromosomes and sex-linked traits. Under-
standing the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms
involved in the diversity of sex determination requires
the identiﬁcation of master genes controlling the sex of
individuals. The only gene of this type identiﬁed so
far in ﬁsh, dmrt1bY in the medaka, is present in only
a restricted number of species. Due to the absence of
recognizable sex chromosomes and sex-linked molecu-
lar markers, zebraﬁsh and both puﬀerﬁshes Fugu and
Tetraodon, with almost completely sequenced genomes,
are not suitable for this type of analysis. Hence, new
models are required to study sex determination in ﬁsh.
The platyﬁsh Xiphophorus maculatus is an aquarium
ﬁsh reputed for its use in cancer research. Due to the
availability of numerous molecular markers delimiting
the sex-determining region, this species is particularly
suitable to study the control of sexual dimorphism. Our
major goal is to identify through positional cloning and
to characterize at both functional and evolutionary lev-
els the master sex-determining gene of the platyﬁsh, as
well as other sex chromosomal genes involved in pig-
mentation, sexual development and melanoma forma-
tion. Bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome contigs from both
X and Y chromosomes have been already constructed
and are being sequenced to completion in collaboration
with the Genoscope sequencing center. The expres-
sion, function, genomic localization and evolution of the
identiﬁed genes will be studied in platyﬁsh and other
ﬁsh models including killiﬁsh, medaka and zebraﬁsh,
as well as in guppies and mollies, which are impor-
tant biological models closely related to the platyﬁsh.
This study has implications for cancer research through
the identiﬁcation of genes involved in the formation of
melanoma, as well as for aquaculture, for which molec-
ular sexing and manipulation of sex determination are
important economical challenges.
- Candidat proﬁl The candidate will analyse at the func-
tional level the genes identiﬁed on the sex chromosomes
of the platyﬁsh. He/she should be highly motivated
by research in the ﬁeld of \“Evo/devo \” and be ex-
perienced in methods used in ﬁsh developmental biol-
ogy. Knowledge in bioinformatics and molecular evo-
lution would be of advantage. The candidate should
be able to work autonomously and demonstrate inter-
est in pluridisciplinary scientiﬁc interactions inside as
well as outside of the institute. - Duration of project

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION Human Population
Genetics and Immunity, CNRS-INSTITUT PASTEUR,
Paris
Population genomics of human innate immunity recep-
tors : genetic diversity and natural selection
* Description of the project Infectious diseases have
played a major role in the evolution of modern hu-
mans because they have been paramount among the
threats to health and survival for most of human evo-
lutionary history. Natural selection is a major force
behind the shaping of patterns of human genome vari-
ability. Inferences concerning the action of natural se-
lection in the human genome provide a powerful tool
for predicting regions of the genome potentially associ-
ated with disease. Genetic variants inﬂuencing human
susceptibility to disease are likely to aﬀect the ﬁtness
of the organism, unless the disease concerned begins
late in the life. There is therefore an intimate rela-
tionship between disease and selection that can be ex-
ploited for the identiﬁcation of candidate disease loci.
As infectious diseases have exerted, and exert, strong
selection pressures, the identiﬁcation of selected loci or
variants of immunity-related genes may provide insight
into immunological defense mechanisms and highlight
host pathways playing an important role in pathogen
resistance. To date, some of the strongest evidence for
selection in the human genome has been obtained for
human genes involved in the immune response or host-
pathogen interactions (MHC, G6PD, CCR5), but few
studies have investigated the extent to which pathogens
have exerted selective pressure on the innate immune
system.
The major goal of our research is to investigate the ex-
tent to which natural selection has shaped the patterns
of genetic variability of human genes involved in innate
immunity. The innate immune system governs the ini-
tial detection of pathogens and stimulates the ﬁrst line
of host defense. In this context, we have recently iden-
tiﬁed distinctive patterns of selection in two closely re-
lated innate immunity genes (DC-SIGN and L-SIGN)
(Barreiro et al. 2005. Am J Hum Genet). We have fur-
ther identiﬁed two variants in the DC-SIGN promoter
region associated with stronger protection against the64 EvolDir May 1, 2007
development of TB (Barreiro et al. 2006. PLoS Med).
These population genetic approaches have allowed us
to show that the patterns of genetic diversity of an-
other innate immunity gene, MBL2, are compatible
with neutrality, suggesting a largely redundant role for
this lectin in immune responses (Verdu et al. 2006.
Hum Mol Genet). In the context of the present project,
we aim to investigate the selective pressures imposed by
the presence of pathogens on genes and gene families en-
coding pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as
Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors and scav-
enger receptors. These PRRs have been shown to rec-
ognize pathogen-derived molecular patterns or to play
key roles in the initial steps of the immune response.
This study, which integrates molecular and population
genetics and bioinformatics approaches, will allow us
to determine the extent to which natural selection has
shaped the patterns of variation of these genes, and to
identify those genes or gene families, variations in which
may aﬀect susceptibility to infectious diseases.
The successful candidate will work in the CNRS Unit
URA3012 at Institut Pasteur in Paris. The main re-
search lines of this Unit are the study of human, vec-
torial and microbial diversity, the interactions among
these populations, and the molecular mechanisms in-
volved in host protection against pathogens. In this
context, the candidate will interact with scientists
in France (Institut Pasteur, Necker Medical School,
Mus´ eum National d’Histoire Naturelle, IRD Montpel-
lier) working in population genetics or other diﬀer-
ent but highly complementary disciplines (Immunol-
ogy, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology, Anthropology,
Epidemiology). In addition, core facilities for genomic
studies (sequencing, genotyping) are available in Insti-
tut Pasteur Campus. This, together with our interna-
tional collaborations (Universities of Cambridge, Ox-
ford, Yale, Chicago, Barcelona), will provide an excel-
lent framework to carry out this research project.
* Candidate proﬁle The successful candidate will be
expected to hold a Ph.D. in the ﬁeld of population ge-
netics or genomics and have a number of international
publications in the relevant ﬁeld. Applicants are re-
quired to have research experience in basic molecular
biology techniques (sequencing, genotyping, Real-Time
PCR), training in human genetics or population genet-
ics, and bioinformatics skills in genetic data analyses.
In addition, strong background in theoretical popula-
tion genetics, statistics, and computer modeling by sim-
ulation would be an advantage. A willingness to engage

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW (EPIGENETICS) -
CSIRO ENTOMOLOGY (Perth, Australia)
We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral fel-
low to investigate the molecular mechanisms under-
lying trans-generational inheritance of epigenetically-
regulated detoxiﬁcation and developmental gene ex-
pression in an animal model system, the aphid Myzus
persicae. Aphids are an ideal model for studying epige-
netic inheritance because of their capacity for clonal re-
production. The project will focus initially on a detox-
iﬁcation gene locus known to be regulated epigeneti-
cally via DNA methylation, which is often associated
with epigenetic inheritance of traits in plants and ani-
mals. The change in methylation pattern of this gene
and the associated insecticide resistance phenotype is
maintained for several generations in the absence of the
insecticide trigger, and a PCR test is available to assess
the methylation status of the gene. It was once thought
that DNA methylation was rare in insects ˆ a but it now
appears that the low levels of DNA methylation ob-
served in Drosophila is an exception rather than the
rule. Interestingly, it appears that the same genes reg-
ulate DNA methylation in aphids and vertebrates: We
have already identiﬁed in the currently-unassembled
aphid genome orthologues for three vertebrate DNA
methyltransferases.
One might expect that asexually-reproducing species
like aphids would rely heavily on epigenetic mecha-
nisms. It is known that polyphagous aphids, such as
M. persicae, take 2-3 generations to achieve maximum
reproductive performance after being transferred to a
new host plant. Epigenetic regulation of detoxiﬁcation
genes could be the mechanism enabling these species to
adapt quickly to diﬀerent host plants. This project will
take maximum advantage of aphid genomics tools now
becoming available, including a full genome sequence.

CornellU GenetSpeciation
A postdoctoral position in behavioral genetics and spe-
ciation is available in the laboratory of Dr. Kerry
Shaw, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cor-
nell University, Ithaca, NY.
Research Project: A postdoctoral position is available
to examine the genetics of behavior and speciation
among closely related species of the Hawaiian cricket
genus Laupala. We seek to examine the genetic basis of
male signal and female preference for song-related traits
that diﬀer within and between species of Laupala. The
successful candidate will participate in marker-assisted
hybrid introgression studies of behavior, marker devel-
opment with the assistance of BAC libraries, and the
testing of hypotheses about the nature of the genetic
basis of behavior and speciation. The development of
additional independent projects is encouraged.
Background: While ecologically and morphologically
similar, species of Laupala are easily distinguished by
the pulse rates of the male calling song. The evolution
of this behavior has played a large role in the rapid
and extensive diversiﬁcation of Laupala. Quantitative
trait locus mapping studies have shown that male song
is under the genetic control of many loci. QTL map-
ping also shows that female preference is under genetic
control. A comparative phylogenetic framework existswith which to understand behavioral evolution in Lau-
pala. This genus is part of a larger radiation of en-
demic Hawaiian trigonidiine crickets that is conspicu-
ously characterized by frequent speciation and acous-
tic signaling evolution. In Laupala, DNA data suggest
that the current radiation began on the oldest island
where the genus is presently found (Kauai, 5 mya), and
radiated into younger island habitats as those islands
appeared within the last 5 million years. These data
also show that speciation has occurred both within and
between islands and that species ranges are limited to
single islands. Communities of Laupala occur on all
the major Hawaiian Islands and convergent patterns of
song evolution among islands, and divergent evolution-
ary patterns within islands, are evident. This phyloge-
netic structure provides a recent evolutionary context
in which to study the evolution of genes, behavior and
speciation. The focal species of the genetic work are en-
demic to the Big Island of Hawaii and are very closely
related.
Requirements: The desired candidate will possess ex-
perience with a number of molecular bench skills (such
as DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, AFLP analysis, cDNA
synthesis, cloning). Some knowledge and/or prior expe-
rience studying behavior, evolution, and/or speciation
or the strong desire to study in these areas would be
highly beneﬁcial.
Cornell Uinversity provides a highly stimulating envi-
ronment with a cross-disciplinary approach to the study
of evolutionary biology, providing a rich academic envi-
ronment for those interested in proximate and ultimate
causes of behavior, evolution and/or speciation. State
of the art genomic facilities are available to assist with
the current research.
The position can be ﬁlled immediately and at least two
years of funding are available. To apply, please send

Title : Genetic determinism of the dynamics of stem
elongation in alfalfa : towards an association study
Supervisor : Bernadette Julier (Dr, HDR) Site :

Conditions for recruitment : the candidate must have
a foreign nationality (non French)
The young scientist will have the task to initiate an
analysis of the genetic basis of stem elongation with
a strategy of association genetics, on the main forage
legume, alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Data of neutral poly-
morphism (microsatellite markers) as well as the pheno-
typic data, collected on a population of 400 genotypes,
sampled in 10 European varieties (40 individuals per va-
riety) will be available. This set of molecular and phe-
notypic data will be used to write a publication describ-
ing the structuration, within and between-varieties, of
the diversity.A second objective will be to quantify the linkage dis-
equilibrium on the chromosome 7 (in a region involved
in stem elongation and ﬂowering date in the legume
model species Medicago truncatula, Julier et al., TAG,
2007). To achieve this task, markers will be deﬁned in
the region, and polymorphism will be studied on the
400 individuals. The scientist will analyse allelic poly-
morphism available for candidate genes mapped in this
region. All data will be used to propose a strategy for
an association study, that could start during the pe-
riod of the contract, depending on the time availability.
More precisely, he will test the possibility to have an
association study on the population of 400 individuals
sampled in 10 synthetic varieties, taking into account
the structuration of this population (preliminary results
showed that the structuration among varieties is very
low).

Milan 2 RotiferEvolution
1) two year Post-Doc position available at the Depart-
ment of Biology in Milan, Italy, in the lab of Claudia
Ricci, claudia.ricci@unimi.it. Deadline: 27 April 2007
Analysis of the nervous system of bdelloid rotifers and
its role in anhydrobiosis.
Almost all 380 species of Bdelloidea (phylum Rotifera)
live in freshwater (Segers, 2002), but most of them are
able to survive lack of water entering a form of dor-
mancy known as anhydrobiosis (Ricci et al., 1987; Ricci,
1998, 2001). Anhydrobiotic animals undergo a series of
adaptations at morphological, metabolic, and biochem-
ical level (Crowe, 1971).
In detail, due to evaporation of water, the bdelloids con-
tract in a characteristic tun shape, which slows down
water lost, compacting tissues and organs in ordered
and rigorous ways (Dickson & Mercer, 1967; Schramm
& Becker, 1987).
Plausibly, the nervous system, together with the cy-
toskeleton, is highly involved in activating the events
leading the rotifer to its dormant state. Nevertheless,
few studies dealt with functional and morphological as-
pects of the nervous system in rotifers (see Hochberg,
2006), and almost nothing is known in bdelloid rotifers.
Aims of the projects are: - describing the structure and
ultra-structure of the nervous system in hydrated and
dormant bdelloids, - elaborating a model to understand
how the nervous system is involved in anhydrobiotic re-
sponse, - disentangling the role of the cytoskeleton in
the mechanisms involved in anhydrobiosis.
For details, look at the application form (in Italian
only): http://www.unimi.it/ricerca/assegni ricerca/-
7550.htm 2) Another post-doc position will be opened
soon. This will involve the analysis of DNA damage
in bdelloid rotifers after stressful events (eg dehydra-
tion, radiation, freezing), and of the subsequent repair
mechanisms after recovering.
Experience with microscopic organisms ir preferred, to-
gether with knowledge of techniques of DNA double
strand breakage (tunel assay, comet assay, markers,
etc).72 EvolDir May 1, 2007

Description: Call for Applications to PostDoc Position
(deadline April 30, 2007)
https://www2.cnrs.fr/DRH/post-docs07/?pid=-
1&action=view&idX2&lang=en A CNRS funded
position for a PostDoc is open at the Laboratory for
Tropical and Mediterranean Ecology in Perpignan
(Southern France). The goal of the project is to
investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in evolu-
tionary processes. Our model is the human blood ﬂuke
Schistosoma mansoni and its hosts. Further details on
the project may be found at:
https://www2.cnrs.fr/DRH/post-docs07/?pid=-
1&action=view&idX2&lang=en
The postdoc position is open for 12 months starting
September/October 2007. Starting date can be post-
poned if needed. A 12 month extension can be pos-
sible. Gross salary 2500 Euros/month (roughly 2000
Euros after insurance and taxes). Administrative aid
in organizing accommodation, insurance etc. will be
provided.
Subject:
The successful applicant will investigate the epigenetic
basis of phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is
the basis of adaptive evolution. In particular, in rapidly
evolving organisms like those belonging to host-parasite
systems, epigenetic mechanisms are likely to play an im-
portant role since they enable a given genotype to gen-
erate a larger variety of diﬀerent phenotypes. The can-
didate will study the interrelation of epigenetic variabil-
ity, phenotypic plasticity and ﬁtness (infection success)
using both a whole genome approach and investigation
of candidate genes that play a key role in host-parasite
compatibility. These genes have recently been identi-
ﬁed in our laboratory. The expected results will be
of beneﬁt not only for the understanding host-parasite
systems, but will shed light on the role of epigenetics
in evolution in general.
Conditions of the PostDoc:
The successful candidate will be physically located in
Perpignan, with the Evolutionary and Functional Par-
asitology team ( http://cbetm.univ-perp.fr/ ). Perpig-
nan is a lively town at the Mediterranean cost of
Southern France, close to the Spanish border. The
candidate will work with Christoph Grunau ( http://-
www.methdb.net ) but will be interacting with all other
partners of the project, and with the partner lab at
the Pasteur Institute in Lille ( http://www.pasteur-
lille.fr/fr/accueil/index.htm ). The laboratory is well-
equipped, has its own animal facilities, and has an ac-
knowledged expertise in the ﬁeld (WHO Collaborating
Center for Biological Control and Snail/Parasite rela-tionships). Working language are French or English.
The candidate should preferably have a PhD in Biol-
ogy, Biochemistry, Genetics, Epigenetics or Parasitol-
ogy with an interest in new aspects of population ge-
netics and evolution. He or she should also have good
communicating skills and a facility and taste for inter-
acting with other people, including Master and PhD
students with diﬀerent scientiﬁc backgrounds. Knowl-
edge in techniques in epigenetics like ChIP and ChIP-
on-chip will be an advantage but are not a prerequisite.
Submitting the application:
The application is in two steps. First, interested candi-
dates must send a CV to Guillaume Mitta (mitta@univ-

Aarhus, Denmark invites applications for two postdoc-
toral positions in statistical and computational biology
from May 2007 (starting date negotiable). The posi-
tions are initially available for one year but with possi-
ble extension to a maximum of three years.
The two positions are related to two diﬀerent projects.
A. The project of the ﬁrst position seeks to develop sta-
tistical methods for analysis of biological network data;
in particular Protein Interaction Networks, preferably
integrated with other relevant data. The exact topic
of the work is open, but should focus somewhat on
the development of MCMC, likelihood-free, or Bayesian
methods for analysis of network data. Currently, one
PhD student and Professor Wiuf are working on the
project. We have a strong collaboration with re-
searchers at Imperial College, London and the candi-
date is expected to spend some time in London. Rel-
evant Refs: [1], [2]; see also <http://www.birc.au.dk/-
%7Ewiuf/group.htm >http://www.birc.au.dk/˜wiuf/-
gr... . B. The project of the second position seeks
to develop statistical methods for validation of methy-
lation arrays and for their further analysis in relation
to diﬀerent cancers and cancer subtypes. Currently,
several PhD students, one postdoc and Professor Wiuf
are working on similar issues using various array types
(SNP, gene, CGH, miRNA). The successful candidate
will work with experimental researchers at the Insti-
tute of Human Genetics, as well as with researchers at
BiRC. Relevant Refs: [3], [4] (though none on methy-
lation arrays yet); see also <http://www.birc.au.dk/ >

UArizona PrionEvol
Evolutionary capacitor mechanisms such as the PSI
prion and the heat shock protein Hsp90 store varia-
tion in a latent form and reveal it later. Adaptations
revealed by a capacitor remain dependent on the con-
tinued expression of that capacitor for some time, until
genetic assimilation is complete. During this period,
“cheater” lineages that do not bear the costs of the ca-
pacitor are unable to usurp the beneﬁts through recom-
bination. This limited eﬀect of recombination, together
with the reversibility of the capacitor, which unlike a
mutation is easily able to switch oﬀ at any time, distin-
guish evolvability mediated by capacitors from evolv-
ability stemming from other mechanisms such as el-
evated mutation rates. The postdoc will design and
implement mathematical models and/or simulations to
capture these two eﬀects. The postdoc may also initi-
ate other projects that model evolutionary capacitance
and/or test their predictions using a bioinformatic /
comparative genomic approach.78 EvolDir May 1, 2007

UCambridge ButterﬂyEvoDevo
Applicants are invited for two ﬁve-year Leverhulme-
funded postdoctoral positions in the Zoology Depart-
ment at the University of Cambridge. This is an excit-
ing opportunity to study the developmental and genetic
basis of dramatic phenotypic adaptations, namely the
mimetic colour patterns of Heliconius butterﬂies. These
butterﬂies are an excellent model system for studying
the genetic basis of natural adaptation and diversity, in
part because mimicry between species means that adap-
tive peaks are well deﬁned, and that the same pheno-
typic adaptations have arisen multiple times. We have
recently shown that the same regions of the genome
are involved in mimicry in three diﬀerent species, H.
melpomene, H. erato and H. numata. In addition these
same genes are also responsible for species level di-
vergence and contribute directly to speciation. This
project aims to develop our understanding of pheno-
typic adaptation and developmental evolution in Heli-
conius.
Position 1. EVO-DEVO: Gene regions controlling ma-
jor phenotypic switches in colour pattern are being
cloned and sequenced. This now oﬀers an opportunity
to study the function of natural allelic variants that
have major phenotypic eﬀects in development of pat-
tern and colour. This position will develop functional
assays for candidate genes and study their expres-
sion in diﬀerent races of Heliconius melpomene. The
postholder will need to develop techniques for RNAi
knockdown experiments and perhaps also germline
transformation in these butterﬂies in order to carry out
functional assays. In addition the postholder will study
expression patterns of candidate loci by rt- PCR, in situ
hybridisation and/or antibody stains. The candidate
should have a keen interest in evolutionary developmen-
tal biology and adaptation, and should have experiencein relevant experimental techniques such as antibody
staining, rt-PCR and genetic transformation of insects.
Position 2. EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS: Heliconius
oﬀer a unique opportunity to study sequence variation
around genes under strong selection in natural popula-
tions. The second position will study natural variation
in Heliconius melpomene populations around the genes
controlling colour pattern. The position will also in-
volve ﬁne scale linkage mapping of further patterning
genes in mapping families that have already been ob-
tained, and the identiﬁcation of quantitative trait loci
responsible for modifying the expression of major pat-
tern elements. The successful applicant should have
experience in the study of molecular evolution and a
keen interest in the genetics of adaptation.
The two postdocs will join a dynamic group working
on Heliconius butterﬂies at the Department of Zoology
in the University of Cambridge. The department also
includes other labs that oﬀer opportunities for collabo-
ration, including that of Prof. Michael Akam and Prof.
Pat Simpson working on insect evo-devo, and Dr Nick
Mundy and Dr Bill Amos working on evolutionary ge-
netics. A new insect rearing facility is due to be built by
the end of 2008 and will provide state of the art facilities
to replace existing greenhouses for stock maintenance.
The project is funded by Leverhulme and forms part of
a collaboration between the University of Cambridge,
Prof. Richard ﬀrench-Constant at the University of Ex-
eter (Cornwall Campus), Dr Jane Rogers and Dr Sean
Humphray at the Sanger Institute, Dr Owen McMillan
at NC State, who is carrying out a parallel project on
H. erato.

Applications are invited for a 3-year, post-doctoral po-
sition funded by the Natural Environment Research
Council. The project will be conducted in close collab-
oration with the University of Melbourne, Australia.
The fruit ﬂy Drosophila, show repeated, latitudinal, ge-
netic clines in diﬀerent continents, with body size in-
creasing with distance from the equator. The clinalpatterns can evolve rapidly, within a decade, indicat-
ing that natural selection is involved. The aim of this
collaborative programme of work is to reach a better
understanding of the selective forces involved and the
target of selection. This will in part be achieved by
the mapping, identiﬁcation and experimental manipu-
lation of the genetic variants that underlie the latitudi-
nal trend in body size.
The project will involve gene mapping, screening
of candidate molecular variants, whole-genome RNA-
expression proﬁling, genetic manipulation including ho-
mologous recombination, and phenotyping of ﬂies. The
appointee will have excellent skills in genetics and
molecular biology of Drosophila and an ability to work
collaboratively and in a busy laboratory. The post-
holder will be responsible, in discussion with the Prin-
cipal Investigators, for experimental design, day-to-day

Postdoctoral Position, Evolutionary Genetics Univer-
sity of Rochester, Rochester, NY, U.S.A.
A three-year NIH-funded postdoctoral position is avail-
able in the laboratory of Dr. James Fry to study
the genetic basis of adaptation to dietary ethanol
in Drosophila. Ethanol is a natural component of
Drosophila breeding sites, and ethanol resistance shows
substantial and apparently adaptive variation among
wild D. melanogaster populations. The powerful ge-
netic tools available in D. melanogaster make this an
excellent system for studying the genetic basis of adap-
tive variation in a trait that has both ecological and
medical relevance. Preference will be given to appli-
cants with demonstrated experience in some or all of
the following: basic molecular methods, Drosophila ge-
netics, bioinformatics, and population/quantitative ge-
netics.

Beyond gap models: reconstructing alignments and
phylogenies under genomic-scale events
A Paciﬁc Symposium on Biocomputing 2008 Session
January 4-8, 2008 Fairmont Orchid, The Big Island of
Hawaii Hawaii, U.S.A.
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) has long been a
mainstay of bioinformatics and has proved quite useful
in the alignment of well conserved protein and DNA
sequences; some of these sequences have also been used
with great success in phylogenetic reconstruction. Se-
quences with low percentage identity, on the other
hand, typically yield poor alignments. Now that re-
searchers want to produce alignments among widely di-
vergent genomes, including both coding and noncoding
sequences we need to revisit both multiple alignment86 EvolDir May 1, 2007
and phylogenetic reconstruction under more ambitious
models, ones that take into account the plethora of ge-
nomic events rather than just substitutions and inser-
tions/deletions (indels). We also need to revisit mul-
tiple sequence alignment and phylogeny reconstruction
for datasets currently beyond the capability of existing
methods, due to high rates of site substitution, high in-
del rates, and large numbers of taxa or sites. Most cur-
rent methods postulate only two types of events: sub-
stitutions (modeled with a transition matrix, such as
PAM or BLOSUM matrices for protein data) and indels
(rarely modelled beyond a simple aﬃne cost function for
the size of the gaps). While these two events can indeed
transform any sequence into any other, their model of
genomic events is far too simplistic: substitutions are
not location- or neighbor-independent and indels can
be caused by a variety of complex events, such as un-
even recombination, insertion of transposable elements,
gene duplication/loss, lateral transfer, etc. Moreover,
genomic rearrangement events can completely mislead
procedures based on most current models, resulting in
a total loss of alignment when a homologous element
has undergone an inversion or a duplication. Computa-
tional biologists have been studying genome rearrange-
ments for 20 years and have started work on duplication
and loss events. Taking these events into account in a
multiple alignment will require the simultaneous con-
struction of the alignment and of the phylogenetic tree
– an approach also known as phylogenetic alignment.
Up to very recently, the computational complexity of
phylogenetic alignment was widely viewed as too high,
but the state of the art in phylogenetic reconstruction
has advanced signiﬁcantly over the last 10 years, both
in terms of accuracy and in terms of computational eﬃ-
ciency, so that what was then impossible is now merely
diﬃcult.
Session Topics
We would like to invite contributions presenting new
methods for multiple sequence alignment, new simu-
lation software for evolving sequences under complex
models of evolution, or evaluations of existing meth-
ods for multiple sequence alignment or phylogenetic
reconstruction under such models. Papers presenting
new methods should provide experimental or empiri-
cal evidence of the performance of the new methods.
In addition, papers that present novel empirical evi-
dence of complex evolutionary processes operating on
molecular sequences are welcome. In this context, sub-
mission topics can include, but are not limited to: -
Methods for simultaneous alignment and phylogeny re-
construction under site substitutions and indels that
demonstrate clear beneﬁts over independent MSA and
phylogeny reconstruction. - Methods and models forgenomic-scale alignment and phylogenetic reconstruc-
tion, including the handling of gene families. - Com-
parisons of existing MSA and phylogeny reconstruction
methods under complex models. - Molecular evolution
relevant to the above topics. Other topics within the
subject area are welcome. Note that all submitted pa-
pers should demonstrate the relevance to this topic. If
unsure whether your paper ﬁts the session theme, please
contact one of the co-chairs.

Ancient DNA Training Program
A training program focused on training participants in
the analysis of degraded, diﬃcult, ancient or low copy
number DNA.
The ancient DNA training program is a three week in-
tensive course in DNA. This year we are delivering the
program from May 22nd to June 9th, 2007 at the Paleo-
DNA laboratory Lakehead University.
During the program, participants will work in small
groups (one instructor to 4 participants) and are given
a project depending upon their interests. This may be
genetic analysis of museum specimens, genetic analysis
of degraded samples, disease in ancient mummiﬁed tis-
sue, genetic analysis of archived specimens or forensic
proﬁling of a remains or many other such projects. As a
participant, you will learn a variety of diﬀerent extrac-
tion methods to compare and contrast on both yourown DNA and other samples. You will generate your
own DNA proﬁle, determine your own mitochondrial
haplogroup/haplotype, your own STR proﬁle, conﬁrm
your own sex genetically and learn numerous techniques
for the analysis of DNA.
The lectures will include the history of various types
of analytical techniques, detailed mechanisms of each
method and an large array of techniques that can be
used in a genetic project. Participants will learn about
the diﬀerent types of DNA that can be analyzed: mi-
tochondrial, nuclear, chloroplast and pathogenic DNA.
You will be taught diﬀerent methods of analysis PCR-
RFLP, multiplex PCR, sequencing, regular PCR and
electrophoresis. You will learn diﬀerent methods of
sample preparation from a number of diﬀerent tissue
types like bone, teeth, hair, archived specimens, mu-
seum specimens, blood residues and mummiﬁed tissue.
You will understand the use of genetic analysis and its
potential in archaeozoology, palaeopathology, archaeol-
ogy, forensic science, palaeobotany and palaeontology.
Lectures by professors and senior analysts in the ﬁelds
of archeology, genetics, ancient DNA, forensic science,
palaeopathology and more are integrated with the lab-
oratory sessions.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
