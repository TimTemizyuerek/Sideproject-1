ence mission is to provide a stimulating platform for
exchange of ideas and experiences, cross-disciplinary
interactions, and long-term national and international
collaborations. Participation of postgraduate and post-
doctoral fellows is encouraged to foster development of
the next generation professional network.
The conference scope includes but is not limited to:
ˆ a computational analysis of DNA, RNA and protein
sequences; ˆ a methods and algorithms of phylogenetic
analysis; ˆ a oriented software development; ˆ a parallel
and distributed computing in genetic data analysis,
datamining; ˆ a evolution of genome, regulatory elements
and genetic control systems; ˆ a dating evolutionary di-
vergences with molecular data; ˆ a phylogenetics in hot
topics of organismal evolution and systematics, phy-
logenomics; ˆ a applied molecular phylogenetics (barcod-

Orlando MarinePopulations Mar2-7
Dear Colleagues,
We would like to invite you to the special session on
population connectivity co-chaired by Iliana Baums and
Claire Paris to be held at the 2008 Ocean Sciences
Meeting in Orlando, Florida from March 2-7 ( http:/-
/www.aslo.org/meetings/orlando2008/ ).
The central theme of our session is Predicting the im-
pact of climate change on marine population connectiv-
ity: Marine species often can be described as metapop-
ulations with varying levels of subpopulation connectiv-
ity across time and space. Evolutionary studies aim at
exploring long-term processes such as, speciation, bio-
geography, historical exchanges events, and population
persistence (Hanski, 1989). Low dispersal rates are suf-
ﬁcient to shift the metapopulation distribution pattern
over time by turnover of local populations: some go
extinct and becoming re-established elsewhere (Levins,
1969). Ecological studies focus on the larval ﬂuxes re-
quired to sustain a population (e.g. design of MPAs to
protect a ﬁshed stock, explanation of recent or current
genetic population structure). Such demographic con-
nectivity usually implies that a substantial number of
individuals are exchanged each generation. Dispersal at
all scales is inﬂuenced by the physical and chemical en-
vironment propagules encounter due in part to behav-
ioral response of propagules to their dispersal environ-
ment. Increasing sea-surface temperatures, changing
water chemistry and shifts in marine community struc-
ture are likely to inﬂuence dispersal patterns. This ses-
sion invites papers that integrate multiple disciplines
to understand the inﬂuence of climate change on the
dispersal potential and its consequence on connectivity
among marine populations.
Scientiﬁc Theme of the Conference: Water connects
and binds us all. It moves from the top of the high-
est mountain to the depths of the deepest oceans. As
limnologists, oceanographers, and educators, water is
the lifeblood of our endeavors. Now, as never before,
we recognize the interconnections between land and sea,
and at the 2008 bi-annual Ocean Sciences Meeting we
are going to recognize the important nature of these
connections.September 1, 2007 EvolDir 7
The Abstract Submission deadline is 2 October 2007
Feel free to contact us with questions. We hope to see
you there!

PH.D. POSITION - GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS OF
PHYLOGENETIC TREES AND NETWORKS
A Bioinformatics Ph.D. position is available in the re-
search group of Dr. Robert Beiko and Dr. Christian
Blouin in the Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie
University. Very large sets of genetic data are being col-
lected from a diverse range of sites around the world;
phylogenetic analyses of these data sets will give us a
deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes that
shape the biosphere. The mission of the Ph.D. student
will ﬁrst be to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and net-
works and bind them to appropriate map coordinates.
The student will then develop algorithms to reconcile
the evolutionary relationships among sequences with
the spatial and temporal relationships among sample
sites.
The ideal candidate will have an undergraduate Hon-
ours or a Master’s degree in Computer Science, with
experience in algorithm development and analysis and
some familiarity with graphics. Experience with phy-
logenetic trees and networks is not necessary, and can
be learned early in the project. Applicants with a rel-
evant background in the biosciences or statistics could
also undertake this project via the Dalhousie Interdis-
ciplinary Ph.D. program.
This position is funded by the Tula Foundation as
part of the Dalhousie Centre for Comparative Genomics
and Evolutionary Bioinformatics (CGEB). The student
stipend will be C$25,000 per year, with opportunities
for conference travel. This project is part of a larger
geospatial initiative that will involve several other stu-
dents and technical personnel. The student will also
interact with other members of the CGEB, which spans
four departments (Computer Science, Mathematics and
Statistics, Biology, and Biochemistry and Molecular Bi-
ology).
We would like to ﬁll this position as soon as possi-
ble, with a start date of either January or May 2008
and the opportunity for a bridging position before the
formal start of the Ph.D. There is no formal applica-
tion deadline, but the ﬁrst evaluations of applicants
will be carried out by mid-September. Interested ap-
plicants should contact Robert Beiko directly (email:
beiko [at] cs.dal.ca) with a curriculum vitae showing

MurdochU AncientDNA
PhD projects on Ancient DNA and Wildlife genetics -
Murdoch Uni, Australia
The ancient DNA & Wildlife Genetics labs are looking
to ﬁll a number of positions for suitably qualiﬁed PhD
candidates to work on ancient DNA, population genet-
ics and wildlife forensic projects. Among other things,
the projects aim to determine the size, and structure
of natural populations using molecular markers. The
projects will involve the application of population ge-
netic analyses to modern and ancient samples to help
address questions of evolution, biodiversity, conserva-
tion and wildlife protection.
Project 1: Molecular ecology and population dynam-
ics of large feral pests: camels in the arid and semiarid
rangelands of Australia. One- humped camels were ﬁrst
introduced to Australia as a beast of burden. When
the motor vehicle replaced camels, feral populations
became established through escapees and deliberate re-
leases. Weighing 500kg+, an estimated 500,000+ indi-
viduals and the population doubling every seven years,
they are increasingly an environmental menace. This
project will allow us to better understand the dynam-
ics of feral camel populations. Strategic decisions can
then be developed on how and where camels should be
managed to minimise impacts on pastoral enterprises,
conservation values and remote indigenous communi-
ties.
Project 2: Ancient DNA as a tool to study past biodi-
versity in south- west Western Australia. The South-
west corner of Australia is one of only 34 regions identi-
ﬁed internationally as a biodiversity hotspot V it has a
fascinating and diverse biota. This ARC funded project
will investigate the evolutionary history of this region
using Ancient DNA isolated from museum specimens
sub-fossil remains and cave sediments. DNA has been
isolated from macropod remains dating back 18,000
years demonstrating the potential to investigate both
extinctions and how patterns of diversity have changed
over time.12 EvolDir September 1, 2007
Project 3: Wildlife protection, enforcement and con-
servation of pythons in Western Australia. Pythons
are allowed to be legally for the pet trade in West-
ern Australia. However, many Australian reptiles are
still highly valued in the illegal wildlife trade, with
many species undergoing pressure from habitat mod-
iﬁcation and poaching. This project aims to (i) charac-
terise microsatellite markers for pythons and examine
their potential for cross species ampliﬁcation in other
threatened species of snakes, (ii) validate the markers
in discriminating the identify individuals and to deﬁne
management units, the species population demograph-
ics and characterise dispersal, (iii) test hypothesis of
mate ﬁdelity and return-rate and (iv) develop molecu-
lar tests for forensics applications.
Project 4: Ancient DNA from middens and coprolites.
The middens of the extinct Stick nest rat (Leporillus)
are time capsules into past environments. The middens
do not just include rat and plant remains because Lepo-
rillus scavenged material from throughout their habitat;
nests contain bone, eggshell, hair, faecal matter, insects
etc. Preliminary data show these middens are excellent
environments for DNA preservation dating back thou-
sands of years. This project will involve using DNA
to proﬁle the composition of past environments. The
project is funded by an ARC discovery grant.
Requirements: We have substantial funding for these
projects and seek highly motivated candidate(s) with
experience in the application and analysis of molec-
ular markers, combined with a interest in evolution-
ary biology, population genetics and/or wildlife ecol-
ogy to apply for the position(s). Before applying please
contact Peter Spencer (P.Spencer@murdoch.edu.au)
and Mike Bunce (M.Bunce@murdoch.edu.au). In-
clude in your initial letter a detailed CV. You should
posses a high grade honours (IA or upper IIA) or
Masters degree and be willing to apply for a Post-
graduate Award (either APA or Murdoch Postgrad-
uate Award). Applications are due on 31st of
October, 2007 ( http://www.research.murdoch.edu.au/-

Evolutionary and functional approaches to the role of
serotonin in parasitic manipulation of phototactism and
olfaction-based antipredator behaviours
A PhD position is available to work on parasitic ma-
nipulation using acanthocephalan parasites and their
freshwater crustaceans intermediate hosts as a model
system. Our previous work has shown that some acan-
thocephalan parasites alter the reaction to light of their
amphipod intermediate hosts and their behavioural re-
sponses to chemical cues from predators used as ﬁnal
host, and that these behavioural changes do increase
the parasites trophic transmission to their ﬁnal hosts
(ﬁsh). Recently, we have reported on the involvement
of a highly conserved neuromodulator, the serotonin,
in parasite-induced altered phototactism. The pro-
posed framework for this PhD study is to further in-
vestigate the role of serotonin in altered phototactism
and anti-predator defense in various crustacean host
- acanthocephalan parasite associations, by combining
behavioural assays, etho-pharmacology, immunocyto-
chemistry and proteomics. The functional link between
brain serotonergic activity and altered photoactism will
be established, in particular by investigating which 5-HT receptors are involved and whether these signalling
pathways are altered by the parasite. The role of sero-
tonin in olfactory response of infected and uninfected
hosts to predators will also be addressed. In paral-
lel, excretion - secretion products from infectious para-
sites will be screened for proteins potentially involved in
these changes of serotonergic activity using proteomic
tools. Our questions ultimately relate to the adaptive
signiﬁcance of parasitic manipulation, by unravelling
the complexity of the underlying mechanisms and in-
vestigating their degree of evolutionary convergence in
diﬀerent amphipod - acanthocephalan systems.
The ideal candidate has an interest in addressing prox-
imate and ultimate questions in evolutionary parasitol-
ogy, by combining etho-pharmacology, biochemistry,
neurophysiology and behavioural ecology. He or she
has a background in any of the relevant ﬁelds - evo-
lutionary parasitology, behavioural ecology, or inver-
tebrate neurosciences - , and an MSc. degree is re-
quired. The salary comes as a grant from the french
ministry of higher education and research (around 1200
euros/month). The duration of the PhD is 3 years. Pre-
ferred starting date 1rst November 2007 or thereafter.
Please send applications, with a full CV, a
short description of research experience and in-
terest in this position, and names of referees
to Pr Frank Cezilly (fcezill@u-bourgogne.fr) and
to Dr Marie-Jeanne Perrot-Minnot (mjperrot@u-

PhD research studentship on the “Evolutionary genet-
ics of an invading species, the harlequin ladybird
Supervised by Dr Lori Lawson Handley Molecular Ecol-
ogy and Evolution Group, School of Biological Sciences,University of Hull, UK
A fully funded PhD studentship is available to study the
evolutionary genetics of the harlequin ladybird, Har-
monia axyridis, a species that is currently invading the
British Isles and posing a potentially devastating risk
to native ladybirds. The pace of the invasion and the
rigorous monitoring of the harlequin’s spread since its
ﬁrst detection in September 2004, provide an opportu-
nity for a unique case study that will contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to our understanding of the evolutionary ge-
netics of species invasions. This project will compare
patterns of genetic variation in UK harlequins to in-
troduced populations in continental Europe and native
populations in Asia, using a spatially explicit landscape
genetics framework, in order to 1) investigate the num-
ber of founders and identify potential sources of inva-
sion 2) characterize spatial and temporal patterns of
genetic structure during the establishment and spread
of the species in comparison to its native range and

UHull HumanPopGenet
PhD studentship in Geographically explicit human pop-
ulation genetics
Supervisor: Dr Lori Lawson Handley Molecular Ecol-
ogy and Evolution Group, School of Biological Sciences,
University of Hull, UK
A fully funded PhD studentship is available to study
geographical human population genetics, at the Uni-
versity of Hull. Recent analyses of human populations
have demonstrated that genetic variation is clinal - in
other words genetic variation gradually decreases with
increasing geographic distance from East Africa. This
is compatible with a recent African origin of modern
humans, and a gradual loss of diversity as we colonised
the world. Such clines demonstrate that most of the
variation in human populations can be explained by ge-
ography, but the role of geographic barriers such as high
mountain ranges, large bodies of water and deserts in
shaping human genetic variation are still poorly under-
stood. They are also potentially useful as null models to
allow investigation of genomic regions under selection,
which is an area of great interest in population genet-
ics. The general aims of this PhD project will therefore
be 1) to investigate the inﬂuence of geographic and cli-
matic variables on patterns of human genetic variation
on more regional scales, and 2) to use this approach
to investigate regions of the genome under natural se-
lection. For background reading relating to this please
see: Lawson Handley et al. (2007) Going the distance:
human population genetics in a clinal world. Trends in
Genetics (available from ljl27@cam.ac.uk or “Articles in
Press” section of TIG website). Applicants should have
a keen interest in evolutionary/population genetics and
hold at least an upper second class honours degree in
the life sciences. The project will entail lab and com-
puter based work, including DNA analyses, statistical
genetics and GIS. Enthusiasm for these areas, but not
necessarily prior experience, is essential.

ULeicester InsectImmuneSelection
BES funded PhD (3 years) at the University of Leices-
ter, U.K.
Parasite driven selection of the insect immune genome.
Supervisor: Dr. E.B. Mallon http://www.le.ac.uk/bl/-
ebm3/homepage.html Large numbers of studies have
looked at vertebrate immune variability in the wild (e.g.
MHC). This work has been important in understand-
ing much of vertebrate intraspeciﬁc ecology. Very little
work has been carried out in invertebrates. However it
is known that resistance for various parasites is highly
variable in invertebrates and that variation is heritable.
Vertebrate immune variability is thought to arise due
to selection pressure of parasites, more speciﬁcally the
entire parasite fauna that the animal will be exposed
to. Is this also the case with invertebrates?
The aim of this PhD is to discover if parasite driven se-
lection plays as important a role in invertebrate ecolog-
ical immunity as it does in vertebrate¨ ı¿1
2s. We will use
the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, as our insect host.
The student will collect large samples of bumblebees
from diﬀerent populations throughout the U.K. He/She
will survey all the parasites found and produce a par-
asite diversity index for each population. Our lab has
a number of candidate genes used in bumblebee immu-
nity. The student will discover the variation in each
population for each of these genes. If parasites are a
selectional pressure on these immune genes, we would
expect that populations with diverse parasite faunas
have the most variable immune genome.
Candidates must hold, or expect to obtain, a Mas-
ter¨ ı¿1
2s degree in a relevant subject. Note that eligi-
bility is restricted to UK/EU nationals.

UNevada EnvGenomics
Ph.D. Graduate Assistantships, Environmental Ge-
nomics
University of Arkansas and University of Nevada, Las
Vegas
Two NSF-funded graduate research assistantships are
anticipated to support Ph.D. candidates interested in
functional genomics of adaptation. The project in-
volves laboratory and ﬁeld experiments designed to dis-
cover patterns of gene expression in populations of cac-
tophilic Drosophila mojavensis exposed to diﬀerent host
plants in stressful and non-stressful thermal regimes.
Our general goals are to uncover whole-genome pat-
terns of gene expression in populations exposed to nat-
ural abiotic and biotic stress. Ultimately, we wish to
pinpoint clusters of functionally interacting genes ex-
pressed throughout the life cycle in diﬀerent environ-
ments, and predict limits of phenotypic plasticity and
adaptation, particularly in response to stressful envi-
ronments and long-term global climate change.
Laboratory experiments will involve DNA microarrays
to study gene expression changes due to diﬀerent host
cacti and temperature stresses, as well as diﬀerences in
epicuticular hydrocarbons. Field- related work will in-
clude multiple ﬁeld trips to Mexico to monitor wild ﬂies,
assess demography of wild populations, and analyze cu-
ticular hydrocarbon and RNA proﬁles. The positions
are part of a collaborative project involving the Univ.
of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and the Univ. of Nevada, Las
Vegas. One research assistantship will be available at
each institution.
Applicants must gain admission to the Ph.D. pro-
gram in the Department of Biological Sciences at
the University of Arkansas or the School of Life
Sciences at UNLV. Application information is avail-
able at http://biology.uark.edu/1251.htm andhttp://-
biology.uark.edu/1251.htm prospective.html. Stipends
start at $22.8K/12 months; tuition and beneﬁts arealso covered. Supplemental funding is available on
a competitive basis for applicants qualifying for Doc-
toral Fellowships at the Univ. of Arkansas ( http:/-

and ringed adults, capturing birds for measurement,
and behavioural assays.
The Place: The Falkland Islands are renowned for their
magniﬁcent bird life, as well as good numbers of other
animals such as elephant seals and killer whales. The
plover project is based on Sea Lion Island ( http:/-
/www.sealionisland.com/index.php/uk/38/ ), the only
site in the Falklands to be an Important Bird Area,
an Important Plant Area, and a proposed National Na-
ture Reserve. It is also a Ramsar designated Wetland
of International Importance. As Darwin observed of
the Falklands avifauna in 1833, the birds on Sea Lion
Island are extraordinarily tame, and it is possible to
study them at close quarters.
Accommodation on Sea Lion Island is in a Portakabin,
with occasional hot water and heating. Conditions areSeptember 1, 2007 EvolDir 21
basic, and the weather is harsh, with strong, cold winds
and some rain and snow.
The Field Assistant: We are looking for someone with
a degree in Biology, Zoology, Ecology or a related sub-
ject, preferably with some ﬁeld experience.
Essential qualities: The successful applicant will be ﬁt,
hard-working and meticulous, and have sharp eyes. He
or she will be capable of working independently and
looking after him or herself, as much of the work will
be unsupervised. Be aware that we will be working
under lonely conditions over Christmas and the New
Year. Most importantly, a positive attitude and sense
of humour are essential!
Desirable qualities: Bird handling/ringing experience
is a bonus, as is the ability drive 4 x 4 with manual
gearshift.
Expenses in the Falklands (including food, accommo-
dation and transport) will be covered, but the applicant
must be prepared to pay their own way to the Falkland
Islands.
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE MAIL OR
EMAIL YOUR CV AND 2 LETTERS OF RECOM-
MENDATION. Applications will close on 10th Septem-
ber 2007.

Job (4 year PhD position): intraspeciﬁc variation in
ﬁsh movement behaviourSeptember 1, 2007 EvolDir 33
A 4 year PhD position for a biologist, specialised in
behavioural and/or molecular ecology, is immediately
vacant at the research group of Prof. Marcel Eens (Lab-
oratory of Ethology, University of Antwerp, Belgium)
to study “intraspeciﬁc variation in the movement be-
haviour of small benthic ﬁsh species: integrating be-
havioural, ecological, endocrinological and molecular
data”.
The aim of this project is to address gaps in our under-
standing of intraspeciﬁc variation in animal behaviour,
especially the movement behaviour of small benthic
freshwater ﬁsh species (e.g. Cottus gobio). To achieve
this, the successful candidate will integrate two closely-
linked research components: (1) describing the move-
ment of benthic ﬁsh using both direct and indirect
methods and (2) experimental investigation of the im-
portance of both extrinsic and intrinsic variables for
benthic movement behaviour. Besides abiotic and bi-
otic variables, also behavioural (personality traits), en-
docrinological (hormones) and molecular (relatedness,
gene expression) variables and mechanisms will be in-
vestigated. The project is supervised by Prof. Marcel
Eens and Dr. Guy Knaepkens and is also in cooper-
ation with the research group of Prof. Filip Volckaert
(Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology, Catholic University of
Leuven, Belgium).
Candidates should have a strong background in be-
havioural ecology, endocrinology, population genetics
and/or molecular ecology. Furthermore, they are re-
quired to have research experience in basic behavioural,
ecological and/or molecular techniques (e.g. animal
tagging, telemetry, electroﬁshing, genotyping, qPCR,
2D-DIGE,...). Finally, experience in ﬁeld and/or labo-
ratory based experimental research is strongly recom-
mended. The candidate is also expected to apply for
national fellowships (FWO, IWT).
To apply, please e-mail a letter of motivation and C.V.
(including scientiﬁc background and study results) to

Title: Research assistant position to work on breedingmigration in bighorn sheep
Study overview: This is a landscape-scale study of male
and female breeding migration in bighorn sheep. The
625 square-mile study area is located in Kananaskis
Country along the east front of the Canadian Rockies
in southern Alberta. We are using GPS tracking tech-
nology, backcountry foot surveys and detailed behav-
ioral observation to understand the who, when, where
and why of bighorn migration. By understanding how
ecological connectivity is established in relatively intact
habitat, we aim to identify how connectivity might be
conserved or restored in more disturbed areas.
Principal Investigators: Dr. Kathreen Ruckstuhl (Uni-
versity of Calgary; www.ucalgary.ca/contact/faculty/-

gary and Montana Conservation Science Institute;
www.mocsi.org ) Salary and term of employment:
$1700/month (Canadian) for the period October 25 -
December 20, 2007. Application deadline: September
15, 2007.
Duties: Working from backcountry tent camps and cab-
ins, assistants will census groups of bighorn and con-
duct structured observations of bighorn rutting behav-
ior. Census surveys will require up to 10-15 miles walk-
ing per day along established routes, scanning with
binoculars/spotting scopes and radio telemetry. Qual-
iﬁed assistants will generally work alone but census
routes will periodically cycle each person through study
headquarters at the University of Calgarys R.B. Miller
Biological Station. Each backcountry tent camp will
have an 8x10 foot internal metal frame canvas wall
tent heated with a metal box wood stove and outﬁt-
ted with lantern, cots, cookware, and radio communi-
cation. Cabins are similarly equipped. The study area
is in a Chinook weather zone but periods of relatively
mild late fall weather are occasionally interrupted by
periods of extreme cold (down to ca. -25 degrees Cel-
sius) and ﬁeld staﬀ must be prepared to function safely
in these conditions.
Experience: Although university-level course work or
degrees in ecology/behavioral ecology are assets, there
are no strict academic requirements. We are more in-
terested in basic intellectual skills (patience, curiosity,
attention to detail), a can-do attitude and a physical
hardiness appropriate to fall-winter ﬁeld work in moun-
tainous terrain. In short, a passion for ﬁeldwork and the
toughness it demands. Additional assets include train-
ing and/or experience in (i) radio telemetry, (ii) winter
camping and travel (skis or snowshoe), (iii) avalanche
risk assessment, and (iv) backcountry medicine. This
is a challenging position V adventure with a purpose V
for persons with advanced ﬁeld and backcountry skills.September 1, 2007 EvolDir 35
Training: Successful applicants will complete a 7-10
day training course in Missoula MT (USA) beginning
in late October. Training topics will include (i) a study
overview, (ii) detailed instruction and practice in data
collection, radio telemetry and set-up and use of back-
country camps, and (iii) short courses in avalanche risk
assessment and backcountry medicine taught by local
experts. The highlight of the training period will be
5-7 days at the National Bison Range (50 miles north
of Missoula) where assistants will practice census tech-
niques and behavioral observation of rutting bighorn in
an un-hunted population with an early breeding sea-
son. Study headquarters: In Canada, study headquar-
ters will be the R.B. Miller Biological Station located
within Sheep River Provincial Park. The station has
road access, cooking and sleeping facilities, electricity
and propane heat but no running water. Headquarters
for the training period are the Montana Conservation
Science Institute (Missoula MT) and the National Bi-
son Range bunkhouse (Moiese MT). Both of the latter
facilities oﬀer the full range of basic amenities (heat,
electricity, running water). Pets are not permitted at
either site and housing is available for project personnel
only.
Travel, supplies and gear: You will be responsible for
travel from your home to Missoula and back. The
project will provide transportation from Missoula to
Sheep River and back and at ﬁeld sites. Also provided
are scopes, tripods, binoculars, tape recorders, note-
books, wall tents, cook ware and stoves, fuel bottles,
water puriﬁers, compasses, ﬁrst-aid kits, radio commu-
nication equipment, snowshoes, cots, saws and assorted
other backcountry camp equipment. You must provide
basic personal ﬁeld gear (storm jacket and pants, boots,
sleeping bag, backpack, etc.). The project will cover all
housing costs but you are responsible for your food and
toiletries.

UQueensland TelomereEvol
Queensland Government & the University of Queens-
land
Brisbane, Australia
Queensland Department of Primary Industries invests
$100m pa in world-class basic and applied scientiﬁc re-
search. Research in the Sustainable Fisheries Unit is
focussed on providing new information about commer-
cially exploited ﬁsheries and by-catch species to im-
prove the accuracy of mathematical models used to set
catch limits. Within this brief, the Molecular Fisheries
Laboratory (MFL) provides information such as genetic
population structure, eﬀective size and individual iden-
tiﬁcation using the most recent advances in molecular
and population genetics.
The laboratory is embarking on an ambitious new area
of work to use telomeric DNA as a marker for indi-
vidual age in a range of ﬁsheries species. This will in-volve transferring scientiﬁc knowledge from the ﬁeld of
human cancer research, where telomeres are a signiﬁ-
cant research target, to non-model organisms such as
lobsters, crabs and prawns. The ages of individuals
of these species in the wild, and hence their growth,
is poorly known. Individual growth is critically impor-
tant in determining the optimal proportion of a resource
that can be removed on a sustainable basis. Sustainable
exploitation of ﬁsheries resources is essential to ensure
the future of the commercial and recreational ﬁshing
industry that is worth about $600 million pa to the
Queensland economy.
MFL is searching for a molecular geneticist (full-time,
initially for one year, $59,564 to 65,046 pa) and a post-
graduate student (stipend $22,000 pa) to work on this
project. Ideally you will have a background or interest
in telomeric DNA and cell biology. The student will
complete an MSc or PhD at the University of Queens-
land and be co-supervised by Dr Melissa Brown (School
of Molecular and Microbial Sciences).

Beckman vs ABI
Dear EvolDir Members,
We are about to start up a new genetic laboratory and
are thinking about sequencers. These would primar-
ily be used for microsatellites. We are debating if we
should go for a Beckman CEQ 8000 or an ABI 3110.
The sequencer will be used to optimize microsatellites.
The high throughput runs will, however, be run on an
ABI 3730 oﬀ campus. Do the two sequencers (Beckman
and ABI) have too diﬀerent chemistries preventing ef-
fective optimization on a Beckman and high throughput
on an ABI 3730? Moreover, I have experience with an
ABI 3110 and was rather happy with it, though I have
not used the Beckman CEQ 8000 any recommenda-
tions or reviews about the Beckman?
Thanks!

I get an error message (The speciﬁed path ... does not

Does anyone have a working copy of the installation
ﬁles they could send me? or thoughts on how to solve
the problem (I must be missing something obvious...).
Alternatively, is there other software performing simi-

CONSEL problems
Dear Evoldir members,
I am trying to compare two tree topologies using ’con-
sel’ (Shimodaira & Hasegawa, 2001) but don’t seem to
get it right. Whenever I try to run the PAUP gener-
ated ﬁle with the sites likelihoods in ’makermt’ I get
two diﬀerent messages (depending on changes I make
to the ﬁle): 1) cant read double, and 2) warnin: zero
size in malloc. There is also another problem since con-
sel don’t like gaps (-) and I have six of them. Thinking
that this could be the problem, I have tried deleting
the sites and making their lnL = 1, but still no luck
with running the programme. Does any of you experi-
enced these problems and have found the solution? Iwill appreciate any suggestion. I use Mac OS 10.3.9.

Clergy Letter Project
Dear Brian,
I’m hoping that you will post the following note on
EvolDir. Although the note is self-explanatory, let me
brieﬂy say that it encourages scientists to add their
names to a list of consultants for The Clergy Letter
Project. Being a consultant simply means that the sci-
entist is willing to answer questions posed by clergy
members who are supportive of evolution and modern
science. The Clergy Letter Project itself is a group of
more than 10,800 Christian clergy who have signed a
letter recognizing “evolution as a core component of
human knowledge.” The purpose of The Clergy Letter
Project is to demonstrate that those fundamentalists
who are asserting that people must choose between re-
ligion and science are not speaking for thousands of
religious leaders. The purpose of the consultant’s list,
the latest initiative of The Clergy Letter Project, is to
provide technical support for these clergy and to make
a large political statement that religious leaders and sci-
entists can work together to promote science literacy.
To date more than 350 scientists from 16 countries have
signed up.
Thanks very much for sharing this information with
your list. For what it’s worth, I am an evolutionary
biologist with a Ph.D. from Washington University.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

LETTER FOR POSTING
Dear Fellow Scientist,
I’m hoping that you will join me in helping to ﬁght cre-
ationism and in support of high quality science literacy
worldwide!
I am writing to you on behalf of The Clergy Let-
ter Project, a collection of more than 10,800
Christian clergy members who have signed The
Clergy Letter (www.evolutionsunday.org <http://-
www.evolutionsunday.org >) asserting that Christian-
ity and modern science can comfortably coexist and
recognizing the centrality of evolution in modern sci-
ence. Many non-Christian religious organizations have
also aﬃrmed the compatibility of faith with science,
and we are currently in the process of expanding our
eﬀorts to include all religions.
In addition to collecting signatures on this open let-
ter, The Clergy Letter Project has sponsored Evolution
Weekend, an opportunity for religious congregations to
come together to discuss the compatibility of religion
and science. Begun as Evolution Sunday, the second
annual event, held on 11 February 2007, had an in-
crease in participating congregations of more than 32
percent from the ﬁrst year’s event.
Over the past several years, many religious leaders have
asked me if I can connect them with a local scientist
who might be willing to help them with some aspect
of a sermon on which they are working or with some
question a congregant has. They have also wondered if
I know of some scientists who might be willing to run
an adult education class for their congregation.
As The Clergy Letter Project matures, we are attempt-
ing to provide more and better resources to clergy mem-
bers who understand the importance of science and who
do not ﬁnd science to be a threat to their faith. That’s
where you come in.
The Clergy Letter Project has recently created an on-
line data base of scientists who are willing to answer
questions posed by clergy members and who are ex-
cited about the possibility of interacting with clergy
members and their parishioners in an attempt to ex-
plain the beauty and power of science. In short, our
purpose has been to create a data base of scientists
who might be willing to provide technical support to
clergy members in need of such support. You can
view this list at http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/-
relexpert data base.htm . These scientists represent
over 14 diﬀerent countries, and will be interacting with
believers of a wide variety of religious traditions.
While the Clergy Letter Project has focused on gain-ing the signatures of American members of the clergy,
we feel the time has come to reach out internationally,
in order to maximize the impact and resonance of our
statement.
If you are willing to be a part of this endeavor, please
send me (mz@butler.edu <mailto:mz@butler.edu >) an
e-mail note with the following information:
Name: Title: Address: Areas of Expertise: E-mail ad-

Additionally, please forward this note to any other sci-

data base and circulate it widely via any list serve to
which you might belong. Together we can build a vi-
brant and strong coalition of religious leaders and sci-
entists who are willing to speak out for high quality
science instruction.

product directly sequenced? If it should be cloned into

Comparing genetics morphometrics
Dear EvolDir members,September 1, 2007 EvolDir 47
I am having diﬃculties with interpreting the diﬀerences
between the “factorial correspondence analysis” and
the “factorial correspondence analysis on populations”
implemented in GENETIX. Am I correct that FCA
does an ordination to minimize the variance among all
observations (i.e. tries to ﬁnd the combination of fac-
tors that explains most of the variation among points),
whereas FCA on populations tries to minimize the vari-
ance between points within populations, but maximizes
the variance between (the centroids of) populations?
I wish to compare the genotypic variance (6 microsat
loci) among conspeciﬁc cichlid ﬁsh populations with
their morphometric variance. For the morphomet-
rics, I exerted a PCA, using “log(traits)” as variables,
and “populations” as grouping variable. I do ﬁnd
some morphometric diﬀerentation between some pop-
ulations. For the genetics, I cannot discriminate the
individual populations using FCA, but with FCA on
populations I do get some separation of certain pop-
ulations. As I want to compare my genotypic factor
analysis results with my morphometric analysis results,
I need to be sure to use a comparable (identical?) or-
dination approach. Therefore, my question is which
technique(s) would you suggest to use in this situation?

Hello, Long analyses, never ending bootstrapping, etc...
we’re suﬀering of these on our own computers and we
are thinking of buying a big machine for several users.
The idea is not to compete with clusters or multimil-
lion machines that would be accesible remotely but to
have a dedicated computer locally that would signiﬁca-
tively lower our waiting time... let say maybe by a
factor 20 or 50 (or more!) as compared to an aver-
age personnal computer? We’re mostly using classical
Mac and Windows softwares from Paup to MrBayes
and all ﬂavours of ML stuﬀ... We’re considering a top
end Macpro with maximal processor speed and number(like 2x4coresx3Ghz) and RAM (like 16Gb), but maybe
there are better suggestions? If you have any idea or
advice we’d be very happy to know them! Thanx in

EﬀectivePopSize estimates
Dear EvolDir members,
I would like to post a general question to the read-
ers of EvolDir dealing with the selection of potential
software packages used to estimate eﬀective population
sizes (Ne) based upon microsatellite data. I suppose
that a lot of small programs exist out there, each hav-
ing unique data formats and assumptions. What would
be the best choice if you know genotype data and gen-
eration time of the investigated populations?
I will post all comments later on EvolDir.

EﬀectivePopSize estimates answers
Here are the comments I received for the Ne-estimator
question recently posted here. Many thanks to every-
one who responded:
———————–
The choice of program will strongly depend on whether
your are co-estimating population size with other pop-
ulation genetic forces, how much you favour speed
over precision etc. For single (isolated) populations
many/all program will do a good job.
Try these based on the coalescent and use a microsatel-
lite mutation model (stepwise or an approximation to
that)

Evol Bioinformatics
Evolutionary Bioinformatics is now on MEDLINE
Evolutionary Bioinformatics , now in its third year,
is an international, peer-reviewed journal focusing
on all aspects of computational evolutionary biol-
ogy, molecular evolution and functional genomics, and
evolutionary bioinformatics (see http://la-press.com/-
journals.php?pa=home&journal id=17 ).
We are pleased to announce that the journal has been
accepted for MEDLINE indexing. This means that the
full text of all journal articles will appear in Pubmed
once XML has been created and approved by the NIH
(approval is underway). MEDLINE indexing ensures
a wide readership among scientists in the most rele-
vant disciplines. Of the approximately 200,000 English-
language scientiﬁc journals published world-wide, only
about 5,000 are indexed by MEDLINE.
Articles appearing in the most recent issue include:
Choosing and Using Introns in Molecular Phylogenet-
ics, a review by Simon Creer

Hi all.
I’ve been having some problems running Genesamp.
When I try to open the program, a black window opens
and then closes itself automatically, along with an error
sound. I tried to run it using the Run function in the
Start menu (Windows XP) but the same thing ocurred.
I tried to run it directly from MS-DOS but that didn’t
work either. I’ve changed computers (though not op-
erating systems) and have still encountered the same
problem. I was wondering if maybe some of you had
faced a similar situation and/or had an idea how to
solve the problem.
Thanks in advance.

GroupSize Parasitism Data
META-ANALYSIS SEEKING DATA ON GROUP
SIZE AND PARASITISM
A National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent:
www.nescent.org ) working group is exploring ways to
enhance meta-analyses and syntheses through broader
requests for data. Here, we present one pilot request
for data for a proposed synthetic work. Charles Nunn
and Laszlo Garamszegi seek unpublished results and
“pointers” to published results involving the associa-
tion between group size and parasitism in vertebrates.
The data will be used in a meta-analysis to investigate
the links between sociality and parasitism. All pub-
lished studies will be cited in resultant publications, and
unpublished work may be given credit through consor-
tium coauthorship for the person providing the data.
For more information, please see:

you have questions about the broader NESCent project50 EvolDir September 1, 2007

HRAS ORFs
Dear all
The HRAS protein is known to have 190 amino acids,
and an open reading frame of 570 nucleotides, and it is
located on the minus strand.
On NCBI

ITS Fungal contamination
Dear Evoldir-ers, We have ampliﬁed ITS sequences
from ~20 species of Irises and sequenced them. BLAST
against gene-bank showed that the sequences are more
relate to fungi than to other gene-bank sequences ofSeptember 1, 2007 EvolDir 51
Irises. We extracted DNA again in highly sterile-care
conditions, and again: fungi sequences... Should we use
fresh young leaves (emerging in late fall)? Should we
use seeds (with horrible dormancy of up to 12 years)?
Our goal is to proceed to population genetics using
ﬁeld-collected leaves, but we need to assure we have
Iris, and not fungal, DNA in hand. Any tips to avoid
fungi contamination? What are YOU doing to avoid
fungi DNA into your plant DNA extract? Thanks in
advance for your answers! Yuval

ITS fungal contamination
It may be that you are amplifying an endophyte or a
smut, both of which may be excluded by heat treat-
ment during micropropagation. The alternative would
be to compare your sequences to those of listed smuts or
endophytes (mostly Clivicipetales, e.g. Neotyphidium
spp.) and exclude matches. I doubt that your fungal
sequences qould mask plant sequences. Perhaps you
could separate your products (fragment analysis based
on size or SSCP) and go from there?

Important phylogeniesDear Colleagues,
I’m preparing an undergraduate journal club in system-
atics and would like to solicit your opinions as I select
the papers.
In your opinion, what are the most important phyloge-
nies that have ever been published? Why?
The criteria you use can be totally subjective. I’m
looking for a fun and diverse group of papers to read.
Though I could ﬁll the course with my own favorites,
I am hoping that the EvolDir community can help me
show my students how systematics has played an im-
portant role in nearly every corner of biological and
biomedical research.
I’ll compile and post the responses.
Thanks!

Leaf Preservation answers
Dear all,
A few weeks ago, I sent a mail about the optimiza-
tion of long-term preservation of leaf material in sil-
ica gel (see my mail below). I¨ ı¿1
2ve got several an-
swers and thank all people you provided advice and
suggestions.The answers were very diverse and diﬃcult
to synthesise. Therefore, I paste them below, for other
Evoldir members who might be interested. Of course, if
some of you have further comments/advice, I¨ ı¿1
2m still
very interested in your experience and opinion!

My mail: Dear all,
I would like to ask for advice/suggestions about the
long-term preservation of leaf material in silica gel (for
molecular studies). We have quite abundant collections
from worldwide ﬁeld trips and wish to optimize the stor-
age conditions for long-term preservation while simulta-
neously keeping this material available (easy to sample)
for current research projects.To our knowledge, no real52 EvolDir September 1, 2007
data are available yet on this topic, and we would like
to know what the experience of diverse people might
suggest about:
- Temperature of conservation: -20¨ ı¿1
2C, 4¨ ı¿1
2C, or
room temperature? -20¨ ı¿1
2C could appear the best so-
lution, but what about the condensation that will form
on the samples when taking them out of the freezer
to sample a piece of leaf? Are high temperatures (30-
35¨ ı¿1
2C) detrimental to DNA preservation? - Is light
to be strictly avoided for DNA preservation? - Bags,
tubes, boxes? Although tubes with screw-caps may
be optimal for DNA preservation, they are very space-
consuming. Therefore, we are rather thinking of using
hermetically-sealed bags (e.g. Minigrip). These bags
should then probably be placed in airtight plastic con-
tainers such as Tupperware boxes¨ ı¿1
2.?? - Some people
put the leaf material into an individual bag only after
the leaf is dry. In this case, would you put silica gel in
the bag? Or would a small amount of silica gel in the
box containing several bags be enough?
In short, any suggestions on the long-term preservation
of dry leaf material for DNA studies would be greatly
appreciated! Thanks to all who could supply ideas.

I have quite a lot of samples stored in silica gel at a
room temperature, that seemed to be OK when I used
them within a couple of years from the collection. How-
ever, I have no experience with long term storage. I
know some people prefer to keep their dried samples
in -20, but I do not have facilities for all my samples
at the moment. I suggest that the “strictness” of stor-
age also depends on applications you are likely to use
with your samples - as some are more demanding to
DNA quality (such as AFLPs) then others (microsatel-
lites, sequencing?). On some cases we have managed to
use herbarium vouchers for AFLP (but not all samples
tested worked though) - but I know some people use
herbarium material quite regularly for microsats and/or
sequencing. I prefer placing individual samples into a
paper envelope/bag and then several of them (e.g. from
one population/locality) into large re-sealable plastic
bag with silica gel. The quality of such bag is a must -
I prefer Ziploc heavy duty freezer bags. I’ve had a lots
of problems with other bags (even from some labora-
tory suppliers) - that just were not airtight. So placing
these bags into some airtight boxes would certainly bea good idea. Best wishes, Sarka Jahodova

Loci for Migration analysis
I would like to post a general question to the readers
of evoldir that deals with the choice of loci to use in an
IM (Isolation with Migration) analysis.
Take this hypothetical example. Suppose one is con-
cerned with a single fragmentation event. This event is
marked by substantial mtDNA divergence resulting in
reciprocal monophyly. Three additional nDNA loci are
sequenced that diﬀer in estimated mutation rates. Sup-
pose nuclear locus A suggests some divergence between
groups but is not reciprocally monophyletic, nuclear lo-
cus B shows some haplotype frequency diﬀerences be-
tween groups but is otherwise uninformative phyloge-September 1, 2007 EvolDir 53
netically, and nuclear locus C shows very little variation
and divergence, and therefore is not phylogentically in-
formative.
Should one use all four loci in an IM analysis or a subset
of only the “informative” loci (In this hypothetical case,
mtDNA, nuclear locus A, and possibly B)? Wouldn’t
the inclusion of uninformative data result in the inabil-
ity of the program to identify the isolation model in the
ﬁrst place?
Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Please respond directly to me at gif-
ford@biology2.wustl.edu
I will post a compilation of responses if there is interest.

Loss of function
Dear EvolDir Colleagues,
I am looking for some examples (if any) that loss-of-
function is frequent than gain-of-function, especially
those cases with some molecular data involved.
What I aim is to illustrate that since the system lead-
ing to a complicated trait, for example ﬂy wings, is such
a complex, and there are many genes involved includ-
ing organ identity genes, organ build up genes, tran-
scription factors and many other regulatory elements.
Therefore the loss of any of these components should
be likely leading to loss of such trait. However, from
no wings to owning wings, it becomes so diﬃcult. This
is because you have to speciﬁcally hit on the speciﬁc
element in the complex synstem. The chance for gain-
of-function, here ie. gain of wings, would be only 10%
for example in a 10-components system. But the loss-
of-function would be much more frequent and easier.
If you have (known) such examples, please don’t hesi-
tate to send me the related literatures. Any discussion
would also be welcomed!Your kind help would be highly appreciated!

Dear Jinyong,
Re. your Evoldir post. I am not sure if I have read your
post correctly, but what you seem to be saying falls dan-
gerously close to the fallacy of comparing the ease with
which you can de-construct a trait (e.g. through loss of
function mutations) with how hard it would seem to be
to put together such a trait in its current form. But, of
course, evolution does not work in the way envisaged by
the latter. Complex traits do not just appear in some
strangely well-developed way with a complex genetic
architecture underlying them - when these traits start
evolving, there is no “complex system” underlying them
yet. So the problem you highlight does not really exist.
For a far more detailed discussion of this kind of thing,
read for example Mike Lynch’s account of the evolu-
tion of protein function (Lynch (2005) Protein Science
14: 2217-2225) and recent explanations for the evolu-
tion of bacterial ﬂagella (apparently considered by ID
proponents to be “impossible” to evolve because of its
complexity). There has also been a recent PNAS sup-
plement on this kind of thing I think. I’d read those.
Best wishes,
Dave Shuker

Dear Jinyong,
Your argument is interesting, but does not accommo-
date the fact that most architectures are highly redun-
dant and robust. Life systems usually employ many-to-
one (genotype to phenotype) mapping functions. Such
architectures confound an experimenters capacity to
unravell what is important and what is not. A large
part of the conﬁguration space may result in no eﬀect
on the phenoype whilst a few rare conﬁgurations may
be highly sensitive to purturbation.
Best of luck with your project. It looks interesting!

Otoliths reading and DNAextraction
Dear Evoldir members,
I was wondering if anyone has been combining old
otolith DNA extraction with subsequent age/growth
rate reading (embedded in epoxy, sectioned and
stained, no burn & crack) on the same otolith. Most
available studies and protocols aimed at extracting
DNA without the need for further use of the otolith.
However, in our project, we want to assess an indi-
viduals growth and age at maturation, as well as its
neutral/adaptive genetic background. Unfortunately,
one otolith was used already for rough age reading,
so both techniques should be performed on the same
otolith. Initial results using published and commer-
cial kits yielded good DNA, but decalciﬁed otoliths too
much for good age reading afterwards (no clear nucleus
visible for alignment and sectioning). I am thus look-
ing for a method/tip yielding good DNA quality and
leaving the otolith structure almost untouched.
Any help on this topic is very welcome !
Thanks already !

PhyloInference RAxML Web-Server
Dear Users of RAxML,
Jacques Rougemont ( http://www.vital-it.ch/vitalit-staﬀ.htm ) and I ( http://icwww.epﬂ.ch/ ˜ stamatak )
have developed a prototype Web-Server for RAxML
which is attached to a 200 CPU-cluster located at the
Vital-IT unit of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.
In order to provide the capability to carry out complete
phylogenetic analyses, i.e. a relatively thorough search
for the best-scoring ML tree and conduct 100 Bootstrap
replicates I have developed a new rapid BS algorithm
in RAxML speciﬁcally for this Web-Server. On aver-
age it is more than 12 times faster than the standard
RAxML BS algorithm. Its scalability and accuracy has
been tested on over 20 pretty diverse (Archaea, Bac-
teria, Plants, Viruses, Mammals) real-world datasets
comprising 125 up to 7,764 sequences, both DNA/AA
as well as plain models/partitioned models. The Pear-
son correlation coeﬃcient between rapid and standard
BS support values drawn on the best-scoring ML tree
averages to about 0.97. In all but one case (0.91) which
has very high average support of 95% and probably re-
quires a diﬀerent correlation coeﬃcient, the correlation
is>0.95. The weighted topological distance between
the majority rule consensus trees of rapid and standard
BS is below 0.06 in all cases and averages to about 0.04.
A full analysis of the 500 Zilla dataset took about 5.2
hours to complete on a single CPU. You might have a
look at the respective result page which will be available
until Thursday August 30: http://phylobench.vital-

The RAxML Web-Server implementation oﬀers some
new features such as separate per-Gene branch length
estimates, and an estimate of the proportion of in-
variable sites (despite the fact that I don’t like
GAMMA+P-Invar, but that is a diﬀerent story). The
source-code release of this RAxML version and an up-
to-date manual will become available later-on this year.
We would thus like to invite you all to help us with test-
ing this web-server which can be accessed via http:/-
/phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/ . Furthermore, we
would like to ask you to spread the word to colleagues
that might be interested in using it, especially to those
who are notorious Windows users or do not have access
to HPC facilities.
Please note that, currently execution times are limited
to 24 hours, but this will soon change (probably next
week). This means that you can analyze single-gene
alignments up to 1,000 to 1,500 sequences at present.
Also note, that the email notiﬁcation service that
the job has been completed, does currently not work
due to those typical technical problems that take
up 90% of our time in CS. You will thus have to
bookmark the JOB ID page as outlined in the ex-
ample above ( http://phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/-56 EvolDir September 1, 2007

Software IDEA
Dear EvolDir Members,
This is to announce the release of IDEA (Inter-
active Display for Evolutionary Analyses), which is
now available for download from sourceforge ( http://-
ideanalyses.sourceforge.net ). Brieﬂy, IDEA provides a
graphic user interface (GUI) to launch PAML’s codeml
and baseml analyses, and another GUI to view and
explore the results (more complete description below).
Screenshots are available at the sourceforge site.
IDEA is currently conﬁgured to run on Unix/Linux
platforms, and can take advantage of a computer grid.
Full MacOS X will be supported in the next release.
In order to run IDEA successfully you need to have
PAML, PHYLIP and a few other programs installed in
your machine (see System Requirements). A few more
will come bundled with IDEA.
Bug reports/comments are welcome and can be
directed to the IDEA project discussion page
on sourceforge ( http://sourceforge.net/forum/-
forum.php?forum id=3D706804 ).
Cheers, Joana

IDEA (Interactive Display for Evolutionary Analyses)
is a graphical interface for PAML (Yang, Z., 1997), a
popular package for conducting molecular evolution
analyses on phylogenies and associated sequences.
IDEA¨ ı¿1
2s graphic user interface (GUI) can be divided
into two main components: one for inputting data
and parameters for the evolutionary analysis using
PAML¨ ı¿1
2s baseml or codeml and another for display-
ing and exploring results. Parameters speciﬁc to IDEA
include options to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree using
PHYLIP (Felsenstein 2005), to perform multiple runs
of codeml with diﬀerent starting values for w (the ratio
of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates,
dN/dS, which is a measure of selective pressure) and
to merge the results of those runs into a single output
ﬁle containing only the results for the run with the
highest likelihood score. IDEA¨ ı¿1
2s output GUI centers
around a table listing, for each dataset, the number
of sequences, the set of evolution models tested and
their associated likelihood score, tree length, w value
and transition-to-transversion rate ratio. In the case
of pairwise comparisons, dN and dS values are also
displayed. The result of likelihood ratio tests (LRT) of
nested evolutionary models are shown. Columns may
be sorted and ﬁltered according to several criteria, and
the distribution of numeric variables can be displayed
in histograms. Two additional panels are presented
in the output GUI: one displays the phylogram as-
sociated with each dataset, and the other allows the
user to visualize variations in w along a gene, in a
scrolling window. IDEA is currently conﬁgured to
run on Unix/Linux platforms. When a computing
grid is available, IDEA can process multiple datasets
simultaneously, for speed of execution.

Software Ngila 1 2 1
Ngila is a global, pairwise alignment program that
uses logarithmic and aﬃne gap costs, i.e. C(g) =
a+b*g+c*ln(g). These gap costs are more biologically
realistic than the more popular (and eﬃcient) aﬃne gap
cost model.
I have recently completed updating the program to ver-
sion 1.2.1. The new version includes two new, evo-September 1, 2007 EvolDir 57
lutionary alignment models based on my current re-
search. These models allow you to ﬁnd the maximum
alignment of two sequences based on biological, evo-
lutionary parameters—no more guessing at biological
costs. Additional changes are noted on the website.

Taxonomy collaboration websites
Dear Colleagues,
You may have seen in the latest EDIT newslet-
ter http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/news.php?optimurl=-
Newsletter–4 an article describing ’Scratchpads’. These
are web sites that EDIT are making available to fos-
ter collaboration between taxonomists. More than
twenty communities are already using their Scratchpad
to share, manage and integrate taxonomic data on the
web.
Would you please advertise and encourage people in
your institution to take advantage of these sites, ei-
ther by collaborating with an existing site or by start-
ing a new one. A little technical skill is required
to manage a site, but we provide an extensive col-
lection of videos to help users get started http://-
www.editwebrevisions.info/help ).
The system to support these sites is based at the Nat-ural History Museum in London, but site content is
owned and managed by the communities that created
them. The NHML will support the server for the fore-
seeable future, certainly beyond the life of the EDIT
project itself.
To learn more, direct your colleagues to: http://

WildGrape DNAextraction
Hi, I’m a graduate student who’s been trying to ex-
tract clean DNA from silica-dried material of the wild
grape species Vitis aestivalis (native to North Amer-
ica) for two months. I have tried Viogene and Qia-
gen kits, and CTAB extractions with the addition of
PVP 40, beta mercaptoethanol, proteinase K, chloro-
form:IAA and phenol steps. I get a fair amount of
DNA on a gel using CTAB, but nothing is amplify-
ing with universal chloroplast primers, even with very
low DNA concentrations. I have no problem getting
ampliﬁcation using cultivated accessions (V. vinifera).
The secondary compounds that are giving me problems,
according to the grape literature, are polysaccharides,
polyphenols, and possible tannins. Has anyone else had
this problem with grapes or a similar tough species, and
do you have any suggestions? Thanks, Kate Waselkov

CornellU MarineSpatialEvol
A postdoctoral position in marine spatial evolutionary
ecology is available in the laboratory of Dr. Matthew
Hare, Department of Natural Resources, Cornell Uni-
versity, Ithaca, NY.
Research Project: A postdoctoral position is avail-
able to investigate postsettlement selection and disper-
sal in eastern oysters, /Crassostrea viriginica/, among
Florida’s Atlantic coast lagoons. This NSF-funded
project integrates measures of postsettlement selection,
genetic inferences of larval dispersal and tests of diﬀer-
ential fertilization success to analyze the mechanisms
shaping population heterogeneity along the latitudinal
ecotone in eastern Florida. The successful candidate
will conduct ﬁeld experiments aimed at understanding
the eﬀects of spatially and temporally varying selec-
tion on oyster growth rate, rate of sexual maturation,
parasite infection intensity, survivorship, etc. The suc-
cessful candidate will manage these ﬁeld eﬀorts and be
responsible for related data analyses and publications.
Development of related projects is encouraged.
Background: For benthic marine invertebrates living in
a matrix of spatially heterogeneous habitat, populationconnectivity via larval dispersal and post-settlement se-
lection both determine population persistence and the
scale of local adaptation. The interplay of these pro-
cesses is particularly evident at biogeographic province
boundaries where many species reach their range lim-
its. The eastern oyster, an ecologically and commer-
cially important reef-building species, is broadly dis-
tributed across a major province boundary in Florida
and shows a sharp step cline coincident with the bound-
ary at some loci. Thus, this species provides a unique
opportunity, provided by latitudinal genetic diﬀerenti-
ation, to genetically identify migrants, determine larval
dispersal patterns, and measure relative performance of
locals, migrants and hybrids through a strong ecotone.
Observed dispersal patterns will be compared to ex-
pected larval advection routes to infer extrinsic disper-
sal barriers and transport pathways. Spatially hetero-
geneous patterns of selection can then be interpreted in
light of asymmetrical dispersal to explore the interplay
of mechanisms maintaining the oyster step cline and
identify range constricting processes that might be gen-
eral enough across species to produce a biogeographic
province ’break’.
Requirements: The desired candidate will possess ex-
perience with the design and analysis of experiments to
measure selection in natural populations. Some knowl-
edge of estuarine systems, bivalve mollusks or inverte-
brate physiological ecology is desired. Familiarity with
or skill at microevolutionary modeling also would be
beneﬁcial. Experience with molecular biological tech-
niques (such as DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, AFLP
analysis, RFLP genotyping) is not required but would
be an asset.
Cornell and Ithaca: Cornell University provides
a highly stimulating environment with a cross-
disciplinary approach to the study of evolutionary biol-
ogy, providing a rich academic environment for those
interested in the interface of ecology and evolution.
Cornell is located in Ithaca, NY, the cultural center
of the scenic Finger Lakes region of central New York,
which is known for its spectacular gorges and water-
falls, lake-side wineries, and rolling farmland. Ithaca
has been called the “best emerging city” in the US
(Cities Ranked and Rated, 2004). It is about a 4-hour
drive from New York City.
Apply: The position is available immediately. It is
funded for two years, renewable annually based on per-

Harvard ButterﬂyEvolution
Harvard University
FAS Center for Systems Biology
A postdoctoral position is available immediately to
work with Marcus Kronforst on the evolution, genetics,
and development of wing color pattern and mating pref-
erence in butterﬂies. Speciﬁcally, the current work of
the lab revolves around identifying the genetic basis of
adaptive color pattern diversiﬁcation and correspond-
ing color-based mate preference in Heliconius butterﬂies
and elucidating the mechanisms by which the develop-
mental process translates this DNA sequence variation
into morphological and behavioral variation.
The research will require work in a variety of areas; from
rearing butterﬂies and performing behavioral experi-
ments to molecular genetics techniques such as PCR,
high-throughput DNA sequencing & genotyping, analy-
ses of gene expression (RNA extraction, real-time PCR,
in situ hybridization), and cDNA library construction
& EST sequencing. Field work in Costa Rica, Panama,
and Ecuador is also possible. Motivated individuals
will have the opportunity to focus research on areas of
particular interest and develop additional projects on
related questions. We oﬀer competitive salary and ben-
eﬁts, state-of-the art facilities and a stimulating multi-
disciplinary environment.
To apply, send a CV, a description of research inter-
ests and experience, and the names, addresses, phone

Post-doc fellowship: Meta-analysis of population ge-
netic and phylogeographic data of several European
marine species.
Key words: comparative phylogeography ? coalescence
theory ? vicariance ? dispersion - refugia Institutional
Context : consortium ?GBIRM? (Genetic biodiversity
Responsive Mode Project) of the European Network of
Excellence MARBEF (Marine biodiversity and ecosys-
tem functioning). <http://www.com.univ-mrs.fr/-
DIMAR/GBIRM/GBIRM%20activity.htm >Duration
: 1 year Starting Date : between 1/10/2007 and
1/01/2008. Main location : laboratoire DIMAR -
(Marseille-France)
Context: The GBIRM project joins several european
research teams involved in populations genetics and
phylogeography of marine organisms (macrophytes, ﬁsh
and invertebrates). The main scientiﬁc goal of the
project is to jointly analyse population genetic data
from numerous marine species in common geographic
areas, in order to reveal common patterns of the geo-
graphic distribution of genetic diversity, and to identify
how life history traits (e.g. presence/absence of a dis-
persal phase) aﬀect these patterns. Very few theoretical
tools are available for hypotheses testing in the ﬁeld of
comparative phylogeography (e.g. Hickerson et al 2006,
worked on testing a common vicariance hypothesis for
a group of species). However, the recent development
of coalescent methods may allow to test more general
hypotheses, such as for example the hypothesis that
a given permeable barrier (e.g. the Gibraltar strait)
originated at the same date for a group of species. Ad-
ditional methods may be suggested by the candidate.
Tasks: The members of GBIRM decided to hire a post-
doc who should provide an added value in the joint
analysis of our data sets : he would apply (eventually
develop) analytical methods allowing hypothesis testing
in the ﬁeld of comparative phylogeography. The goal
of the post-doc is to analyse this multi-speciﬁc dataset
in a comparative way. The main questions will be the
estimations of gene ﬂow and divergence dates across64 EvolDir September 1, 2007
key transition zones ? The post-doc will communicate
his results in several meetings, some already planed: in
Crete (Greece) in June 2008 to present the results and
in an international congress in Valencia (Spain).
Proﬁle: The ideal candidate should have a strong back-
ground in genetic data analyses, specially using coales-
cent theory, and ideally programming skills. The can-
didate should be autonomous for the theoretical aspect.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION - ECOLOGY AND
EVOLUTION OF AVIAN DISEASE
A postdoctoral position is available in the Department
of Biology at San Francisco State University, with aﬃl-
iations to the Center for Tropical Research at UCLA.
We are seeking a broadly trained evolutionary biologist
with a strong background in the application of molec-
ular genetic techniques to diseases of natural popula-
tions. The position is available for one year with the
possibility of renewal for a second. The position is now
open and applications will be accepted until the posi-
tion is ﬁlled.
The successful candidate will work as part of an in-
terdisciplinary team investigating the eﬀects of defor-
estation on the prevalence of blood-borne pathogens in
African rainforest birds. Using existing samples, as well
as collecting new ones, and using PCR-based detection
methods and molecular phylogenetics, the candidate
will work collaboratively to investigate how long-term
anthropogenic changes in habitats aﬀect the prevalence
of infectious diseases in natural populations. The three
main objectives of the study are to: 1) determine how
pathogen prevalence changes over time within diﬀer-
ing rainforest habitats, 2) determine host, habitat and
vector speciﬁcities of blood-borne pathogens to explore
the degree of host-switching, and 3) determine, using
remote sensing and bioclimatic data, the environmen-
tal variables that best correlate with pathogen preva-
lence and develop models that will aid in the prediction
of how ecological change will aﬀect disease prevalence
and the likelihood of host switching.
The postdoctoral fellow will also have the opportunity
to explore broader questions related to population di-
versiﬁcation and microevolutionary processes of avian
blood parasites. S/he will be encouraged to interact
and collaborate with graduate students and colleages
at SFSU. Interested candidates should e-mail a CV, a
brief description of research interests, and names and

UCBerkeley SocialInsectEvol
POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR Genetics and Behavior
of Social Insects
The Department of Environmental Science, Policy and
Management at UC-Berkeley is currently seeking three
Postdoctoral Scholars in the laboratory of Dr. Neil
Tsutsui.
We are seeking Postdoctoral Scholars to study the ge-
netics and behavior of social insects. Previous work has
focused on the charming, yet invasive, Argentine ant
(Linepithema humile). In this species, genetic changes
during introduction have altered individual behavior
and, in turn, the social organization of introduced pop-
ulations. These changes have contributed to the Ar-
gentine ant’s invasive success by promoting the forma-
tion of massive “supercolonies” in the introduced range.
Publications from previous research can be downloaded
from: http://nature.berkeley.edu/tsutsuilab . Current
research topics include the chemical basis of nestmate
recognition, population genetics of native and intro-
duced populations, and the development of genomic
tools for studies of behavior, learning and memory in
Argentine ants and other social insects.
The Postdoctoral Scholars will have opportunities to
contribute to ongoing research in these areas, as well
as work on other projects related to the lab’s core in-
terests. Applicants should have a strong background
in one or more of the following areas: chemical ecol-
ogy, population genetics, genomics and gene expression,
and genetics of behavior, learning and memory. Previ-
ous experience in behavioral ecology and/or insect bi-
ology is desirable, but not required. Salary is $38,412
or commensurate with experience; generous beneﬁts are
included. The start date is negotiable. Applicants must
have received their Ph.D. within the last ﬁve years.
Applicants should submit, by Sept. 15, 2007, a CV, a
brief statement of research interests, copies of relevant
publications and/or manuscripts, and contact informa-
tion for two references to the email or postal address

UCLondon YeastSpeciation
Post-doctoral position in the genetics of hybrid sterility
in yeast.
Department of Biology, University College London.
Salary will be within the range of: £21,050 to 25,134
per annum, plus £2,572 London Allowance, Grade 6 on
the UCL salary scales.
A post-doctoral research associate is sought for one
year for a NERC- funded project on speciation in
yeast. When the Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cere-
visiae mates with the closely related species S. para-
doxus, the resulting hybrid oﬀspring are viable but the
gametes produced by these hybrids are not. A possible
cause of this hybrid sterility is that certain genes from
one species are incompatible with those of another. The
aim of this project is to screen chromosomes for the
presence of such speciation genes.
The project is based in the laboratory of Duncan Greig
and will involve classical yeast genetics, genetic manip-
ulation, PCR, and pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis. Full
details of the method are described in a recent publi-
cation: Greig, D. (2007) PLoS Genet 3(2): e21. The
post-holder will be responsible for the day-to-day run-
ning of the project, including technical troubleshoot-
ing, data analysis, writing-up and publicly presenting
the work. The ideal candidate would be an experi-
enced yeast geneticist with a strong background in spe-September 1, 2007 EvolDir 69

Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the Western, Southern and Eastern shores of
South Africa and is the only one of the six species that
occurs in South Africa that is commercially exploited.
H. midae displays a very slow growth rate, taking two
to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an obstacle
in the proﬁtable farming and global competitiveness of
this species. In order to increase the productivity and
the proﬁtability of the commercial activity, a research
program has been designed that makes use of the mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. The research program consists of three main
tears: a) establishment of breeding programs with the
assistance of genetic markers, b) generation of linkage
maps and QTL identiﬁcation, c) and the application of
gene transfer technology.
The successful candidates will be primarily responsi-76 EvolDir September 1, 2007
ble for a) the construction of tissue-speciﬁc, full-length
cDNA libraries for Haliotis midae b) the development
of a Haliotis midae Expressed Sequence Tag Database
(dbEST) c) linkage mapping in Haliotis midae with pos-
sible QTL identiﬁcation
Candidates should have a) A strong background in
molecular genetics with applicable knowledge in cDNA
technology. b) Practical experience in DNA sequence
analysis and a strong background in bioinformatics is
a prerequisite. c) A proven background in molecular
genetic markers with applicable knowledge in linkage
mapping.
The positions are available for 2 years.
Interested candidates are requested to send their CV,
including the details of two references, to Dr. Rou-
vay Roodt-Wilding at roodt@sun.ac.za. Please mark
clearly on your application for which research area
speciﬁcally (a,b,c) you are applying for.

Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Behavioural Ecology
of Social Systems
Salary Scale: Grade 7 £26,666 to £31,840 p.a. (Pay
award pending). Starting salary no higher than
£29,138 p.a.
A 3 year NERC-funded postdoctoral position is avail-
able to join the research group of Prof Jeremy Field at
Sussex University (UK) working on the behavioural and
evolutionary ecology of social systems. The start date
is 1 December 2007 or as soon as possible thereafter.
The main aim of the project is to understand helping
decisions in primitively eusocial insects, using Polistes
paper wasps as a model system. In particular, to sep-
arate the eﬀects that kin selection and direct ﬁtness
beneﬁts have on behaviour, and to investigate the role
of inheritance in promoting helping. The result should
be the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the
basis of helping in a primitively eusocial insect.
The project will involve a combination of ﬁeld exper-
iments and genetic work using microsatellite markers
that are already available. Wasp cuticular hydrocar-
bon proﬁles will also be analysed by a project partner
in Italy (Prof. S. Turillazzi). The successful applicantwill spend 2-5 months each year conducting ﬁeldwork at
an established site in southern Spain, usually together
with other members of the research group. There will
be a technician working on the project who will carry
out most of the molecular work.
The successful applicant will have a Ph.D in be-
havioural/evolutionary biology. Experience with an-
imal social systems (especially primitively eusocial
wasps), and experience of ﬁeldwork, statistical analy-
sis using R’ or similar programs, theoretical modelling
or molecular techniques would be useful, but it is not
necessary to have experience in all of these areas. An
ability to speak Spanish, or willingness to learn some
basic Spanish, is desirable.

Postdoctoral position in Evolutionary Genetics
A postdoctoral position is available for three years in78 EvolDir September 1, 2007
the group of Lukas Keller at the Zoological Museum
of the University of Zurich, Switzerland, to study the
genetic basis of inbreeding depression in a natural bird
population.
The project aims to address a long-standing issue in
evolutionary genetics, the genetic basis of inbreeding
depression, by combining the analysis of extensive life-
history data with molecular genetic approaches and re-
cently developed statistical tools to map quantitative
trait loci (QTL) in pedigreed populations. We are ad-
dressing this issue in a natural population of song spar-
rows (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, a small
island oﬀ the West Coast of Canada. This unique pop-
ulation has some of the most complete and extensive
pedigrees of any natural population, spanning over 30
years and 25 generations. Analyses of inbreeding and
its consequences in this population have revealed sig-
niﬁcant inbreeding depression in several ﬁtness compo-
nents, making this population an excellent system to
quantify the genetic basis of inbreeding depression via
QTL mapping.
I am seeking a highly motivated and well-qualiﬁed post-
doc. Applicants must have a PhD in evolutionary ge-
netics, animal and plant breeding, statistics, computa-
tional biology, or related ﬁelds. Postdoctoral experience
and experience with QTL analyses would be advanta-
geous, as are molecular laboratory skills. Good quan-
titative skills are essential. The successful candidate
is expected to develop her/his own ideas within the
context of the research project and to supervise MSc
projects.
The University of Zurich has a strong and interactive
group of evolutionary biologists, including several at the
Zoological Museum, the Zoological Institute, the Insti-
tute of Environmental Sciences, the Institute of Sys-
tematic Botany, and at the neighbouring Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology (ETH). My lab has state-of-the-
art facilities with DNA extraction and liquid handling
robots and access to high-throughput sequencers and
excellent bioinformatics facilities. Zurich is a highly
attractive city in beautiful surroundings not far from
the Alps, with a multinational population, and many
educational and recreational opportunities.
The position is available immediately for a period of

A three year postdoctoral position in animal behavior
is available at the University of Michigan working with
Drs. Thore Bergman and Jacinta Beehner. The re-
search involves behavioral, vocal, and hormonal studies
of a population of wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada,
a close relative of baboons) in Ethiopia. Speciﬁcally,
we are studying the relationship between social knowl-
edge and sexually selected signals in geladas. Within
this framework, several lines of research can be pursued
including: playback experiments documenting knowl-
edge about other group members, fecal derived hor-
mone studies addressing the physiological correlates of
status and signals, acoustic analysis of vocal signals,
and color analysis of visual signals.
The ﬁrst two years of the position will consist of ﬁeld-
work at our remote research site in the Simien Moun-
tains National Park of Ethiopia. During this time the
postdoc will be responsible for (1) conducting the ﬁeld
research and (2) managing the small research camp.
The ﬁeld site is remote and living conditions are diﬃ-
cult. Therefore, ﬁeld experience is required. The ﬁnal
year of the position will be spent at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor analyzing data and writing up
the results.
We welcome applicants with PhDs in Anthropology, Bi-
ology/Zoology, or Psychology. Applicants must have

UtahU PlantMammal Interactions
Post Doctoral Research Associate Functional Genomics
of Plant-Mammal Interactions
Speciﬁcally, this project involves investigation into the
evolution of creosote feeding by the desert woodrat
(Neotoma lepida). Within the past 10,000 yrs, the
desert woodrat has evolved the capability to deal with
the large quantities of toxic resin ingested while for-
aging on creosote leaves. This capacity for resin tol-
erance diﬀers among desert woodrat populations such
that populations with evolutionary experience with cre-
osote voluntarily ingest greater quantities of creosote.
Furthermore adapted populations have higher enzyme
activities, particularly, cytochrome p450 2B, 1A and
GST. The goal of this project is to identify potential
candidate genes and to conduct functionality assays
particularly with respect to the detoxiﬁcation enzymes
related to creosote feeding. Publications available
@http://www.biology.utah.edu/dearing/index.html .
Qualiﬁcations: Applicant must have a Ph.D. and expe-
rience with the molecular approaches such as RNA ex-
traction, PCR, cloning, sequencing and microarrays as
well as experience with the appropriate computer soft-
ware (sequence alignment etc). Background in phar-

Title: Vienna - MHC genetics One Postdoc position
in MHC genetics is available in the genetics labora-
tory of Franz Suchentrunk at the Research Institute
of Wildlife Ecology, University of Veterinary Medicine
Vienna, Austria, in co-operation with Helmut Schaschl
(Konrad Lorenz Inst. for Ethology, Vienna).
The position is connected to a project on MHC genes
and endoparasites in brown hares, Lepus europaeus, to
understand the meaning and consequences of immuno-
genetic diversity for individual ﬁtness in wild living
mammals. In this project we use brown hares (Lepus
europaeus) as a mammalian model to assess and anal-
yse the consequences of sequence variation of two MHC
class II genes (DRB, DQA) on parasite burden and
other ﬁtness parameters in natural populations. De-
scription and characterization of those genes by or lab
are expected in the next future.
To understand the meaning of allelic MHC variability
we investigate relationships between sequence variation
at the studied loci and individual endoparasite load,
various ﬁtness parameters such as body condition and
female reproductive success, as well as CD4+ T-cell
counts.
The successful applicant will particularly be responsible
for performing real-time PCR and SSCP analyses in the
context of infection experiments to quantify changes in
gene expression, as well as analyzing the data and writ-
ing manuscripts.
In addition, wet lab experients such as PCR, cloning,
sequencing, microsatellite analysis, SSCP, basic bioin-
formatic tools are necessary. Most desirably, the candi-
date should have a strong immunogenetic and/or pop-
ulation genetic background. Project language will be
English.
Funding is available for 2 years. Postdoc salaries (FWF-
Austrian Science Funds- pay scale) before tax and NI
are 2.878,60 Euro, 14 times per year. Depending on
marital status and chlildren this salary translates into

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
