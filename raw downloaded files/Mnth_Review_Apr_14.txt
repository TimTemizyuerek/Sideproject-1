Invasion Genetics: The Baker and Stebbins Legacy A
symposium at Asilomar, CA (USA) 13-15 Aug 2014
We are nearing the 50th anniversary of one of the most
important books in evolutionary biology: The Genetics
of Colonizing Species (1965) edited by Herbert Baker
and G. Ledyard Stebbins. This classic volume was
based on a symposium at Asilomar, California in 1964
and initiated the study of the genetics and evolution of
invasive species. To revisit the historical legacy of the
meeting and book, we are pleased to announce a sym-
posium at Asilomar from August 13-15, 2014. The sym-posium will enjoy support from Wiley-Blackwell Pub-
lishers, and associated original papers will appear in a
Special Issue of Molecular Ecology in 2015. The sym-
posium proceedings (including the popular question-
answer transcripts of the original) will also be published
in 2015 as a book to mark the 50th anniversary of the
original volume.
Please plan on joining us for this special event! DATES:
August 13-15, 2014 LOCATION: Asilomar Conference
Grounds (http://www.visitasilomar.com/)
REGISTRATION: Details at http://invasion-
genetics.eventbrite.com Contributed posters will
be welcomed - title submission will open June 1, 2014.
SPEAKERS/AUTHORS: We have conrmed a broad
range of contributors to reect both the legacy of work
on the genetics of colonizing species, and new contribu-
tions and perspectives:

CBA Conference announcement: Understanding biodi-
versity dynamics using diverse data sources
From April 22V24 this year the Centre for Biodiver-
sity Analysis and CSIRO (OCE Cutting Edge Science
Symposia) will be hosting a conference and series of
workshops at CSIRO Discovery & ANU on Understand-
ing biodiversity dynamics using diverse data sources
<http://cba.anu.edu.au/news-events/understanding-
biodiversity-dynamics-using-diverse-data-sources >.
In the face of rapid, global environmental change, it
is essential that we understand how biodiversity is dis-
tributed and its response to environmental change, past
and future. This challenge will be met by integrating
conventional approaches to biodiversity analyses, span-
ning environmental, genomic, phylogenetic and trait
data in space and time, with cutting-edge informatics,
including visualisation, statistical modelling and simu-
lation.
In addition to our invited speakers <http:/-
/cba.anu.edu.au/news-events/understanding-
biodiversity-dynamics-using-diverse-data-sources/-
conference-organisation >, we will be encouraging
students and early career researchers to present
lightning talks and posters <http://cba.anu.edu.au/-

SCOPE Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a
striking example of convergent evolution found in about
7% of higher plants that signicantly enhances plant
water-use eciency by facilitating the nocturnal uptake
of CO, coupled with daytime stomatal closure. The
increased frequency of drought over the past century,
as well as substantial current variation and predicted
future increases in its global occurrence, has intensi-
ed interest in understanding how CAM plants are so
well adapted to survive in water-limited environments.
High-throughput sequencing of transcriptome, genome
and proteome has been initiated internationally for sev-
eral CAM species and the large-volume datasets gen-
erated from these projects look set to provide a step-
change in our understanding of the mechanistic basis
and evolutionary origins of CAM biochemistry. Eec-
tive utilization of these resources requires collaboration
among molecular geneticists, physiologists, ecologists
and taxonomists to generate hypotheses that expand
the potential of the CAM system for developing more
water-use ecient crops, and for informing the improve-
ment of economically and ecologically relevant CAM8 EvolDir April 1, 2014
species for bioenergy production and the maintenance
of ecosystem services.
The following major topical themes will be covered:
- Ecology: CAM species are key components of threat-
ened biomes that include tropical montane cloud forests
and xerophytic succulent scrub. - Evolution: Date-
calibrated phylogenies generate specic hypotheses
about the evolutionary origins of CAM and the palaeoe-
cological context in which particular lineages arose. -
Ecophysiology and metabolism: How is the diel sup-
ply and demand for carbon coordinated with stomatal
conductance to optimize carbon gain and water-use ef-
ciency? - Genomics: What are the molecular triggers
that underpin the C -CAM transition? How does tran-
scriptional/posttranscriptional regulation achieve the
manifestation of CAM on a background of C biochem-
istry? - Exploiting CAM for sustainable productivity:
What are the prospects for engineering CAM into C
crops? Can species such as be exploited for biofuel pro-
duction on nonagricultural or under-utilized semi- arid
lands?
FORMAT We aim to promote basic research in CAM
by integrating functional genomics with biochemistry,
physiology, development, ecology, and evolutionary
studies to gain new insights into the regulatory mech-
anisms and evolutionary origins of the pathway. We
will highlight the potential of CAM research for tack-
ling bioenergy and environmental challenges pertaining
to water security and resource limitation and the main-
tenance of productivity and ecosystems services in a
changing world. In addition to this, specic talks will
look at new research areas and address the big questions
for future research. The symposium will take place over
four days at the Granlibakken Resort and Conference
Center, on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, Tahoe City,
CA, USA. There will be dedicated time for discussions,
posters, selected poster talks, a eld trip and a confer-
ence dinner.

Apr23-25
Early Bird Registration Deadline - 14th March 2014
The BSPB Spring Meeting 2014 will take place at Lan-
caster University, UK which is set in 360 acres of beau-
tiful parkland and lies approximately three miles south
of the City of Lancaster. The campus is easily accessi-
ble via road and rail, and is within 70 miles of Manch-
ester's International Airport. The meeting opens on
the Wednesday evening with a Plenary Lecture on the
use of protists to investigate eukaryotic origins, given
by Martin Embley. Two symposia then follow.
The rst celebrates the distinguished career of Bland
Finlay who, after 35 years of protistan research, has
recently retired from his academic post at Queen
Mary University of London. Speakers paying trib-
ute to Bland's contribution to protistan biodiversity,
biogeography and ecology include Genoveva Estaban,
Tom Fenchel, Stephen Maberly, Bill Martin and David
Wilkinson.
The second symposium examines the evolution and
ecology of agellate protists within the guts of in-
sects, with invited contributions from Rod Dillon (Sand
y), Petros Ligoxygakis (Drosophila), Eamonn Mallon
(Bumblebee) and Renate Radek (Termites). The meet-
ing also welcomes contributed papers on any aspect of
protistology and is particularly keen to encourage stu-
dent contributions. Students presenting at the meeting
will be eligible for the Humphrey Smith Student Prizes
for best oral and poster presentations.

ESEB 2015 Lausanne: CALL FOR SUBMISSION OF
SYMPOSIUM PROPOSALS
The 15th Congress of the European Society for Evolu-
tionary Biology will take place in Lausanne (Switzer-
land), August 10-15, 2015.
Submissions for symposium proposals are now in-
vited. These will be processed through our
website, currently at: http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/-
eseb2015/ Information about the symposia can be
found at: www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/symposium-
information
For symposium submission, please go to: http:/-
/www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/wpgforms/-
symposium/ You will be asked to provide:
1. The names and e-mail addresses of one organizer (for
all communication) and one co-organizer (as a replace-
ment). Both must be committed to attend the whole
meeting. 2. The proposed symposium title. 3. A sum-
mary of max 200 words explaining why you think this
makes a good subject for the ESEB Congress. 4. The
names of one or two invited speakers (please check be-
forehand whether these people are available). Organiz-
ers cannot invite themselves to their own symposium.
The deadline for submission is June 30, 2014. Pro-
posals will be evaluated by the Scientic Committee,
and the selected list communicated in September 2014.
Symposia proposals on overlapping subjects may be re-
quested to fuse.
A call for talk and poster submissions will be sent out
in November 2014, with a deadline of January 15, 2015.
At this time, symposium organizers must be prepared
to screen submissions for their symposium (for which
an on-line evaluation system will be available).
Symposia typically start with one or two invited speak-
ers (40 min each, including discussion) and are followed
by submitted talks (15 min plus 5 for discussion). Thetime window allotted to each symposium will be de-
cided by the Scientic Committee, depending on the
number and quality of submissions. Some symposia
might be cancelled at this stage if they do not arouse
sucient interest.
We do not provide nancial support for organizing a
symposium, but ESEB will pay the registration fee for
invited speakers.
Check our webpage for up-
dates: www.unil.ch/eseb2015; or

on this website, answers to commonly asked questions
in the FAQs, and explanatory text in the registration
pages. Here are some helpful tips:
* Registration costs depend on whether you are a stu-
dent or a postdoc, and whether you are a member of
one of the three societies. (It works out that the dis-
counted membership rate for registration far osets the
membership fees for any of the three societies)
* As with last year's conference, we will have a Super-
Social event with food and drink at the North Carolina
Museum of Natural Sciences on the last night of the
conference (Tuesday, 24 June). This event is included
in the cost of your registration.
* You can return to the registration site after you have
registered to submit your presentation. Just click on
the \Author Center" in the menu once you have logged
in.
* This year, you will see that we are collecting abstracts
for all presentations except lightning talks. We are do-
ing this for two reasons - rst, it will provide more in-
formation to attendees about your presentation, and
second, it will allow us to group presentations into ap-
propriate sessions.
* Once all talks have been conrmed, there will be a
link for you to upload your presentation. This will hap-
pen in early May.

We are pleased to announce an undergraduate travel
award to bring talented and diverse undergraduates to
the Evolution meetings this June 20-24 in Raleigh, NC
(www.evolution2014.org). For the 12th year in a row
we will y a cohort of undergraduates from throughout
the US and Puerto Rico to present a poster at the meet-
ings, receive mentoring from graduate students, post-
docs and faculty, and participate in a career-oriented
'Undergraduate Futures in Evolutionary Biology' panel
and discussion. The program covers the costs of travel,
registration, food and accommodation at the meetings.
The application deadline is Monday, April 14th, and
decisions will be announced by Monday, April 21st. Ap-
plications are welcomed from all undergraduates, and
the admissions goal is to create a diverse pool of stu-
dents.
An overview of the program and student eligibility, and
a link to the online application can be found at:
www.nescent.org/eog/undergraddiversity Applications
consist of a short statement of interest, a letter of rec-
ommendation and the title and abstract of the poster
to be presented.
In addition, we will be soliciting names of graduate
students, postdocs and faculty members who would
like to serve as mentors during the meetings. Men-
tors meet with pairs of students and attend talks withthem, introduce them to colleagues, network and gen-
erally make the meetings a welcoming place for them.
Although costs are not covered for mentors it is an
unusually rewarding experience. Contact Richard Kli-
man (rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu) if you are interested
in serving as a mentor.

Butteries as Hosts: what do they face and how do they
face it? at the 7th International Conference on the
Biology of Butteries in Turku, Finland on the 11th
- 14th of August 2014. http://nymphalidae.utu./-
icbb2014/index.html Butteries serve as hosts to an
extremely large range of organisms, from endo- and
ecto-parasitoid wasps, pathogenic fungi and viruses, to
endosymbiotic bacteria exhibiting phenotypes in the
spectrum between parasitism and mutualism. Such in-teractions can have profound consequences for the biol-
ogy of buttery hosts. The consequent co-evolutionary
arm races might, indeed, lead to modications in the
hosts1immune strategies, demography, behaviour and
important ecological and life-history traits. It is critical
that we acknowledge the presence and impacts of par-
asites, pathogens and symbionts in shaping the biology
of their buttery hosts. This symposium will bring to-
gether an exciting mix of researchers to examine some
of the best-studied interactions and their consequences
for buttery species, for a broader understanding of the
butteries. The Keynote speaker for this session is As-
sociate Professor Sonia Altizer from University of Geor-
gia, USA (http://saltizer.myweb.uga.edu/). Other in-
vited speakers are Dr. E. Hornett (USA/UK), Dr. T.
Huigens (Netherlands) and Dr. M. Gibbs (UK).
We are now accepting abstracts for talk or poster pre-
sentation for the3Butteries as hosts2symposium.
### Deadline for abstract submission is the 1st May
2014 ###
Talk info: Each talk = 12 min + 3 min questions. Pre-
senters not oered talks, may present posters. Poster
info: Regular A0 poster size (841 x 1189 mm, portrait
orientation ONLY)
The whole conference promises additional exciting sym-
posia including sessions on various aspects of butter-
y Biology, Conservation and Genetics, with plenary
speakers by Prof. Ilkka Hanski (Finland), Naomi Pierce
(USA), Antonia Monteiro (USA) and Felix Sperling

State of the art: Time-calibrated phylogenetic trees
are increasingly used in biology, in particular to high-
light evolutionary radiations or biological crises, to es-
tablish a correlation between speciation and extinction
rates and environmental changes or to compare diver-
sication rates between clades. Also, modern compara-
tive methods for establishing correlations between char-
acters generally require trees with estimated branch
lengths. For a long time, the dating of the tree of
the life was based solely on the fossil record. During
the last decades, the fast progress in molecular phylo-
genetics allowed inference of divergence times, but pa-
leontological data have been under-exploited for this
purpose, with few (mostly minimal) paleontological are
constraints used in each study.. Both communities (pa-
leontologists and molecularists) gain to work together
on this theme, because fossils are not available for each
node of the tree and because molecular phylogenetics
still relies mostly on fossils to calibrate their trees. The
Bursidae (Mollusca: Gastropoda) represents an ideal
model for an interdisciplinary study combining molec-
ular phylogenetic trees and paleontological morphologi-
cal and stratigraphic data. It contains around one hun-
dred currently recognized extant and extinct species re-
sulting from a Cenozoic radiation. So far, it was little
studied: a sole molecular phylogeny of the Bursidae
was published by our team (Castelin et al. 2012) and
no phylogeny dealing with the fossil record is available.
Objectives: The goal of this project is to date the di-
versication of Bursidae, which is currently poorly con-
strained and based on a subsample of the known di-
versity. To achieve this objective, molecular (for ex-
tant taxa) and morphological (on extant and extinct
taxa) data will be independently analyzed before being
used in a combined, total evidence analysis. Our new
method will use the resulting trees and detailed strati-
graphic data to supply more reliable estimated geolog-
ical ages for taxa than those supplied by the classical
paleontological approaches. This implies a clearly mul-
tidisciplinary approach, including a step (the incorpo-
ration of all taxa into a \total evidence" phylogeny)24 EvolDir April 1, 2014
that has never, to our knowledge, been undertaken in
molluscs.
Methodology: Molecular phylogenetics: knowing the
limitations linked to the molecular approaches based on
a few genes, the objective will be to apply an approach
using NTS (New Technologies of Sequencing) to iden-
tify multiple markers. Paleontological phylogenies: the
phylogenetic analysis will use cladistics and methods of
formalization of the characters (ontogenetic and topo-
logical correspondence and criterion of conjunction) to
propose hypotheses of primary homologies. It will rely
mainly on the treatment of the numerous sculptural
characters of the bursid shell. The PhD student will
use a total evidence approach to establish a robust phy-
logeny of the Bursidae with a dense taxonomic sam-
pling. Both sets of data (molecular and morphological)
can be combined according to various methods to date
the tree of life. The classical approach consists in spec-
ifying the age of certain nodes based on simple paleon-
tological constraints (typically mostly minimal ages).
A second approach (total evidence dating) consists in
incorporating extinct taxa directly into the analysis, to
incorporate the uncertainty on their systematic position
and estimate the length of the branches. Finally, the
third strategy consists in using birth and death models
and trees incorporating stratigraphic data (about ex-
tinct taxa) to estimate the age of clades. This method,
which we are currently developing to exploit phyloge-
nies with a fossil record, will be used in the project to
obtain paleontological age priors that will be used to
produce a molecular timetree.
Material: 17 species of Bursidae are already sequenced
for several genes, and their DNA is available. The col-
lections of the MNHN from

EvolutionaryMetagenomics
Hello,
Please nd below the description of a graduate position
on 'Network analyses of the impact of a quick dietary
shift in the gut microbiome of the lizard species, Po-darcis sicula'
This PhD proposal aims at determining what it takes
(in terms of microbiome changes) to become an herbiv-
orous lizard in less than 35 years.
Most lizards are insectivorous. Yet, several species and
populations of lacertid lizards have evolved toward an
omnivorous or even herbivorous diet. Our model sys-
tem, Podarcis sicula, a lizard species has shown rapid
evolution of feeding and digestive tract morphology in
manipulated populations. In 1970, ve breeding pairs
of the insectivorous P. sicula were transferred from the
islet of Pod Kopi Ate to the islet of Pod Mraru, Croatia.
36 years later (representing about 30 P. sicula genera-
tions), the transplanted P. sicula on Pod Mraru had
become mostly herbivorous. This dietary shift resulted
in changes in head size and bite force among the pop-
ulations on the two islands, and most striking changes
in the lizards guts, since the herbivorous Pod Mraru
lizards had developed an elaborate hindgut chamber
with cecal valves, which had not been seen in any other
population of P. sicula. These valves facilitate plant
digestion by the gut microbial community of the lizard
hosts. With the advances of next generation sequenc-
ing, this system oers a unique opportunity to investi-
gate the impact of this dietary change at the level of the
microbiome using metagenomic and metranscriptomic
data. We will take advantage of the inclusive powerful
comparative framework oered by sequence similarity
networks, and exploit concepts of graph theory, to an-
alyze the functioning and the evolution of genetic di-
versity of the lizard gut microbiomes in such massive
datasets. In short, we will address the following ques-
tions through a comparison of the gut microbiomes of
insular herbivorous lizards and of their insectivorous
relatives:
1) Does the taxonomy of the microbiome correlates with
the diet? 2) What changes in gene content and func-
tions did the dietary shift produce? In particular, what
gene families were acquired/lost during this transition?
3) What role did the gut mobilome play in these func-
tional changes? 4) Overall, were the changes mostly
functional (and through lateral gene transfer) or taxo-
nomical (through a deep change of the microbial pop-
ulations)
To tackle these issues, the candidate's main goal will be
to use and develop novel exploratory methods, based on
sequence similarity graphs to describe and compare the
taxonomical and functional diversity of metagenomes
and metatranscriptomes of gut microbiomes of lizards,
and to assess the possible impact of lateral gene trans-
fer within this microbial community in this remarkable
adaptive shift.April 1, 2014 EvolDir 25
He/ she will work within a consortium of friendly
herpetologists (Anthony Herrel), computer scientists
(Philippe Lopez) and evolutionary microbiologists (Eric
Bapteste), and be hosted in the University Pierre and
Marie Curie and in the National Museum of Natural
History, in Paris.

Recombination Hotspots and Adaptive Evolution
A PhD position in evolutionary genetics and genomics
is available in the Jones Lab at the Max Planck Insti-
tute in Tuebingen, Germany. This is one four positions
funded by a prestigious 2M EURO European Research
Council funded grant investigating the evolution of re-
combination in adaptation in stickleback sh, an evo-
lutionary model organism.
We study the molecular mechanisms underlying adap-
tive evolution and speciation. The goal of this partic-
ular project is to use cutting-edge techniques to char-
acterize, quantify, map and manipulate meiotic recom-
bination hotspots at unprecedented resolution across
the genome, among individuals, and between species.
We will map the genetic basis of recombination mod-
iers and study the eects of recombination variation
on individual tness in the lab and eld. This ground-
breaking research will elucidate how a fundamental bi-
ological process shapes the genomic basis of adaptive
divergence in natural populations.
Your role: You will provide a comprehensive view ofgenetic factors underlying variation in recombination
and its role in adaptive evolution. Your research will
comprise both computational (dry) and experimental
(wet) components. For computational work you will be
responsible for genetically mapping variation in recom-
bination hotspots in F2 families using whole genome
sequence data, and searching for genomic features as-
sociated with recombination hot- and coldspots. In the
wetlab you will work on functionally dissecting hotspot
modiers, and study the tness consequences of recom-
bination between adaptive loci in lab and natural pop-
ulations.
Requirements: You will have a Masters or equivalent
degree in the area of genetics, bioinformatics, molecu-
lar biology and/or evolution. We are looking for person
with training in molecular biology techniques such as
cloning, library preparation, uorescent in situ hybridi-
sation, and computational genomic methods including
experience with unix and coding in C, python, perl, or
R. The successful candidate will demonstrate a passion
to study genetics and the molecular mechanisms of evo-
lution.
Our Team: You will work in a multidisciplinary team
that uses population genomics, genetics, molecular, de-
velopmental, and evolutionary biology to study the
molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation and spe-
ciation in the threespine stickleback sh. Our research
group is funded by the European Research Council
(ERC) and the Max Planck Society and is located on
the Max Planck campus in Tuebingen, Germany. Our
campus hosts world-class research groups, including 7
other ERC-funded teams, and operates state-of-the-art
sequencing and other core facilities. English is the
working language. All seminars and communications
are in English.
Our Oer: The position is for three years. Salary and
benets are according to the German public service pay
scale (TV oD Bund).
The Max Planck Society seeks to increase the number of
women in areas, where they are underrepresented, and
therefore explicitly encourages women to apply. Dis-

GenomeBioinformatics
Positions in genome bioinformatics
Two positions at the PhD/Master student and postdoc
level are available for developing new algorithms and
strategies for analysis of second- and third-generation
sequencing data, and for using these data to study a
wide array of biological questions, with an emphasis
on genome assemblies, annotation and genome compar-
isons. Initial appointments for PhD students and post-
docs will normally be for three years. The positions are
available immediately.
Candidates will have demonstrated experience in se-
quence and genome analyses, with at least some
knowledge of primary short read analysis and
genome/transcriptome annotation. Proven skills in at
least one major programming or scripting language
(PERL/PYTHON, Java, C/C++) and Linux/Unix
computing environment (Bourne/Bash shell scripting)
are a must. Good understanding of molecular biology,
experience with assemblies and familiarity with bio-
statistics including knowledge of R are a plus.
The lab comprises a mix of computational scientists, bi-
ologists with strong bioinformatics skills and molecular
biologists. It provides unique opportunities, as the lab
is not only very well funded, but bioinformaticians are
also involved in designing genomic analyses from day
one, and often propose their own project ideas. Our
work in this and other areas routinely results in high-
prole publications, making it an extraordinary place
for talented and ambitious students and postdocs.
The lab has been an early adopter of next generation
sequencing technologies and has used these for diverse
applications, from studying de novo mutations and
epimutations to being the rst to ne-map and iden-
tify a causal mutation using bulk segregant sequencing
(Schneeberger et al., Nature Methods 2009; Ossowski
et al., Science 2010; Becker et al., Nature 2011). A
major eort is in understanding within- and between-
species sequence variation, using both resequencing and
de novo assembly strategies (Cao et al., Nature Genet-ics 2011; Hu et al., Nature Genetics 2011; Slotte et
al., Nature Genetics 2013). A agship project is the
1001 Genomes project for Arabidopsis thaliana (http:/-
/1001genomes.org). In this area, we have already gath-
ered experience with PacBio data and will have early
access to nanopore sequencing.
We are working closely with other groups that are pri-
marily informatically oriented. These include Daniel
Huson (Univ. Tuebingen), Bernhard Sch olkopf (Max
Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tuebingen)
and Karsten Borgwardt (currently Max Planck, soon
ETH Zurich/Basel). Additional information on the
group, the institute, and Tuebingen can be found on
our website (http://weigelworld.org).
For Master and PhD students, we expect that you can
provide at least two letters of reference and that you
describe in detail your practical programming experi-
ence.
For postdocs, we expect that you have published (or are
close to publishing) at least one rst-author paper in a
major international journal. Please send a letter that
outlines which projects you are particularly interested
in.
For both graduates students and postdocs, we hope to
see a cover letter that details how your experience and
interest would t with the projects outlined above.

Montpellier Tunicate EvoDevo
Hello,
A 3-year PhD fellowship is available from October
1st 2014 in Montpellier (France) to study the molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying morphological stasis during
evolution.
*The question:* Evolutionary biology studies mostly fo-
cus on the mechanisms driving innovation and adapta-
tion. Morphological features can however remain sta-
ble over surprisingly long periods of time, and in spite
of extensive genome sequence alterations. Very little
is known about the determinants of this morphologi-
cal robustness to genomic changes, which may involve
a careful balance between external selection and inter-
nal developmental constraints. It is also not known
how morphological stasis can be broken to give rise
to new life forms. We are studying this phenomenon
in chordates using two groups of tunicates as models.
Ascidian embryos have shown exceptional morphologi-
cal stability since the Cambrian, over 500 million years
ago, despite extreme genome sequence divergence. By
contrast, the embryos of thaliaceans, a pelagic group,
which causes sessile ascidians to be paraphyletic, have
undergone a radical morphological change from their
ascidian-like ancestors, associated to an ecological tran-
sition from sessility to pelagy.
*The project: *The aim of the PhD project will be
to identify molecular mechanisms underlying ascidian
morphological stasis and thaliacean divergence. Mor-
phological evolution is thought to be mostly driven
by coding or non-coding changes in the transcriptional
gene regulatory networks underlying embryonic devel-
opment. To shed light on the evolution of such net-
works, you will use extensive genomic and transcrip-
tomic ascidian and thaliacean datasets to explore the
evolutionary forces that shape regulatory proteins and
the /cis/-regulatory sequences driving their expres-
sion.The project will mostly involve advanced computa-
tional and statistical analyses of existing, unpublished,
sequencing data. You will be involved in the precise
denition of the project.
*Qualications:* An MSc degree in a relevant eld is
mandatory. Ideal candidates will be strongly driven for
a research career with thorough education and strong
interest in evolutionary biology, population genetics
and genomics, and potentially developmental biology.Programming skills are expected. Some experience in
genomics would be a plus but is not mandatory. Pro-
ciency in English or French is needed.
*Conditions*: The PhD training comprises three years
of full time research. The successful candidate will be
jointly aliated to the complementary research teams
of Emmanuel Douzery (Institute for Evolutionary Biol-
ogy of Montpellier, ISEM) and Patrick Lemaire (Center
for Research in Macromolecular biochemistry, CRBM,
Montpellier). The student will be mostly based at
ISEM.
*Application*: The application should include 1) a
one-page description of your education, research inter-
ests and motivation for PhD studies, 2) a CV with
grades or ranks, 3) Contact information (name, ad-
dress, email address, and phone number) for at least
two referees. The application can be written in En-
glish or French and should be sent by e-mail to Em-
manuel Douzery (emmanuel.douzery@univ-montp2.fr)

Oslo 2 EvodevoModeling
I would like to bring to your attention two PhD posi-
tions in evolutionary developmental biology are avail-
able at the Department of Biology at the University of
Oslo. One of these will be focused on mathematical or
statistical modeling of the GP map, and the other on
the developmental basis of speciation and reproductive
isolation.
The deadline is 20 April.
The announcement (pasted below) and further infor-
mation can be found at the following link:
http://uio.easycruit.com/vacancy/1149295/-
96323?iso=no If you are interested in the
modeling position feel free to contact me at
\thomas.hansen@bio.uio.no". For interest in
the speciation position contact Paul Grini
(p.e.grini@ibv.uio.no).
Sincerely,
Thomas F. Hansen
Two positions as PhD Research fellow in Evolution-
ary Developmental Biology is available at the Depart-
ment of Biosciences. The fellowship will be for a pe-
riod of up to 4 years, with 25 % compulsory work (e.g.
teaching responsibilities at Department of Biosciences)
if the Department nds the candidate suited. Other-
wise, the fellowship will be for a period of up to 3 years,
with no compulsory work. Starting date no later than
01.10.2014.
Job/ project description: The two positions are part
of an initiative to strengthen research in evolutionary
developmental biology (Evodevo) at the University of
Oslo. The position will be associated with the Centre
for Epigenetics, Development and Evolution (CEDE,
www.mn.uio.no/ibv/evogene/cede/) , which is a prior-
itized research area at the Department of Biosciences.
The main objectives of the PhD projects is to 1) develop
mathematical or statistical models of the genotype-
phenotype map in the context of evolutionary develop-
mental biology, and 2) to understand the developmental
basis of hybridization barriers in eukaryote systems and
diversication processes at the species level.
Position 1 PhD Research Fellow in (Theoretical ) evo-
lutionary developmental biology A core concept of
evodevo is the genotype-phenotype (GP) map, whichconnects genetic variation to phenotypic variation and
to potential for evolutionary change. The aim of the
project is to develop or investigate models of the GP
map that can be related to specic biological study
systems or specic evolutionary questions investigated
by the group. There is considerable exibility as to
the exact topics, and the interests of the candidate
will be important in dening the study objects. The
project should include mathematical or statistical mod-
eling aimed at understanding how properties of the GP
map determines variational phenomena such as integra-
tion, modularity, canalization, plasticity, robustness,
pleiotropy and epistasis. These properties can then
be linked to evolutionary topics such as evolvability,
constraints and reproductive isolation. These models
can be abstract or linked to specic biological systems.
The latter may take the form of \causally-cohesive
models" in which lower-level physiological or develop-
mental parameters are given an articulated and ide-
ally empirically-based connection to the genotype, and
higher-level phenotypes are emerging from a mathemat-
ical model of the physiology. The modeling can focus on
gene regulation, cell-cell communication, epigenetics or
physiological and developmental mechanisms. The suc-
cessful candidate will receive training in mathematical
and statistical modeling and in the eld of evolutionary
developmental biology and epigenetics. The supervisor
of the theoretical aspects will be professor Thomas F.
Hansen. In addition the candidate will work with one
or more members of the group in relation to specic
questions or study systems. For a complete list of mem-
bers in the group see www.mn.uio.no/ibv/evogene/cede
.Candidate study systems include epigenetics, develop-
ment and gene-regulation networks in Arabidopsis (Rei-
dunn Aalen, Melinka Butenko, Paul E. Grini), bryozoan
polymorphism and colony development (Lee Hsiang
Liow), evolution of multicellularity (Kamran Shalchian-
Tabrizi), consequences of hybridization or the evodevo
of bill-shape variation (Glenn-Peter S ~Atre).
Position 2 PhD Research Fellow in evolutionary de-
velopmental biology An ultimate eect of phenotypic
change is speciation, which represents the branching of
\the three of life". We would like to understand the
mechanistic basis (genetic and epigenetic) as well as
the phenotypic consequence leading to post-zygotic bar-
riers, and subsequently possible speciation, across eu-
karyote lineages. Hence, genetic and epigenetic ap-
proaches are combined with ecological and evolution-
ary thinking to understand diversication processes of
life. We have established the genus Arabidopsis and
Passer sparrows as model systems for addressing the
underlying processes of phenotypic

The role of birds in shaping networks of interactions
between plants, arthropods and fungi in South Africa.
What will the World be like without birds? We know
that birds pollinate many plant species, they disperse
the seeds of an even greater number, in addition they
are predators that prey on innumerable insects every
day. Nevertheless, the world without birds is dicult
to imagine because so many factors interact in complex
ways to shape the natural world around us. To an-
swer the question of the ecological signicance of birds32 EvolDir April 1, 2014
we are conducting a bird exclusion experiment on an
unprecedented scale. \The World without Birds" con-
sists of six walk-in cages, each of which excludes birds
from a 20 X 20 m area of natural Fynbos vegetation
in the spectacular Jonkershoek Valley in the Cape Fold
Mountains of Africa. The experimental setup, which is
already in place, oers the opportunity to test a range
of ecological theories with direct implications for con-
servation. Two important avenues of research remain
open: How important are birds as predators; and as
vectors of mites and fungi that live inside Protea in-
orescences? An overarching aim is to gain a general
understanding of how networks of ecological interac-
tions form, and respond to species loss. Both projects
have a strong theoretical basis, while at the same time
requiring detailed natural history observations.
The Botany and Zoology Department at Stellenbosch
University has a vibrant Plant-Animal Interactions
study group consisting of several researchers and stu-
dents. These projects are supervised by Prof. An-
ton Pauw, Dr. Francois Roets and Prof. Cang Hui,
who specialize in evolutionary ecology, entomology and
mathematical ecologyrespectively. The values of the
bursaries are R 50 000 p.a. for MSc and R 70 000 p.a.
for Ph.D. South African students will be given prece-
dence for funding, but students from other countries
can apply for our departmental Foreign Students' Bur-
sary and will nd the University registration fees to be
modest. For primary consideration, applicants should
apply by 28 April 2014. Informal inquiries, prior to for-

UFlorida SpatialEcologyBehavior
Ph.D. student position in behavioral ecology, spatial
ecology, and evolution at the University of Florida
starting Fall 2014.
Applicants must have a M.S. in ecology, evolutionary
biology, behavior, or a related eld. If you are inter-
ested in the position, please email Dr. Rob Fletcher
at robert.etcher@u.edu before April 5th. With your
email, please include your resume, unocial transcrips,
GRE scores, and a cover letter. The successful appli-
cant will be awarded a fellowship through the UF Ento-
mology program that includes four years of guaranteed
funding at $22,000/year plus tuition and benets.
This position would be co-advised by Chris-
tine Miller (Entomology & Nematology Depart-
ment; http://millerlab.net) and Rob Fletcher
(Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Department;
http://plaza.u.edu/robert.etcher/) at the University
of Florida, with eld research at the Ordway-Swisher
Biological Station, near Melrose, FL. Work will fo-
cus on animal behavior, population dynamics, and
spatial networks using the unique research system of
a cactus-feeding insect, the cactus bug (Chelinidea
vittiger), and its Opuntia host plants. We have an
ongoing eld experiments funded through the Na-
tional Science Foundation to test for the resiliency of
population networks of cactus bugs to environmental
change (habitat loss). The student would work in
the context of these broad experiments to understand
how behavior (foraging, habitat selection, dispersal,
or mating strategies) drive ecological and evolutionary
processes under rapid environmental change.
Cactus bugs are excellent species to investigate these
questions because they have short generation times, in-
dividuals can be easily tracked through mark-recapture
techniques, and their habitat can be readily manipu-
lated in the eld. This system is truly unique for experi-
mentally addressing questions regarding animal disper-sal (e.g., Fletcher et al. in press; Ecology), population
dynamics (Fletcher et al. 2013, Nature Communica-
tions), landscape ecology (Fletcher et al. 2011, PNAS),
foraging behaviors (Miller et al. 2012, Animal Behav-
ior), and reproduction (Miller et al. 2013, PLoS One).
This position could include eld and modeling compo-
nents to address questions of fundamental importance
that lie at the interface of ecology, animal behavior, and
environmental change.

Food security in the omics era: the role of polyploidy,
hybridisation and mating system on the ability of crops
to adapt to changing environments
An acknowledged threat to food security is the ability of
crops and livestock to respond to increased environmen-
tal variability resulting from climate change. In plants,
crops are often selected to be able to self-propagate
but this comes at a cost to genetic variation, which
could reduce potential for adaptation to changing en-
vironments. Hybridising dierent strains can increase
genetic variation and combine desirable traits from dif-
ferent species but this is often accompanied by doubling
of the genome (polyploidisation) to increase stability of
the hybrid combination. Theoretically, this should in-
crease exibility to adapt to changing conditions. How-
ever, the relative eects of such breeding strategies on
adaptability and the consequences for yield of econom-
ically important traits remain largely untested. Impor-
tantly, plants adapting to changing environments need
to be able to continue to attract benecial symbionts
(pollinators and soil microbes that enable them to pro-
cess nutrients) and to combat potentially new threats
(pathogens and herbivores) but it is not known how the
combination of mating system, ploidy and hybridisation
aect such interactions. An exciting technological de-
velopment is characterisation of microbial communities
using deep sequencing approaches. The vast amounts
of data generated and the diculty of resolving species
based on short sequences means that improved meth-
ods need to be developed for characterising microbial
diversity and interpreting what this means for interact-
ing organisms.
Using a common garden approach, combined with gen-
eration and analysis of deep sequencing data, and devel-
opment of advanced statistical approaches to character-ising biodiversity, the purpose of this multidisciplinary
project is to use economically important Brassica napus
(oilseed rape, which is used for both biofuel and edible
oil production and is a polyploid hybrid that reproduces
by self-fertilising) as a model to investigate:1) the rel-
ative ability of plants with dierent traits to adapt to
new environments; 2) the role of the microbial com-
munity in plant adaptation;3) the consequences of the
interaction between plant tness and microbial commu-

OriginOfSpecies
6 PhD / postdoc positions available on eco-evolutionary
assembly of ecological communities
At the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies
of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, there
are 6 vacancies for PhD students and/or postdocs, as
part of the research program 'On the origin of species
assemblages' which is funded by a VICI grant awarded
to Prof. Rampal S. Etienne.
Content
This program aims to develop a fully stochastic, dy-
namical, eco-evolutionary and data-friendly theory of
community assembly, and testing and informing this
theory with model-oriented experiments and eld stud-
ies of both macro-organisms and micro-organisms.
The theory will contain models of speciation, extinc-
tion, immigration, and evolutionary change that vary
in spatial, phylogenetic and biotic complexity, and will
be designed for confrontation with data. The mod-
els include but are not limited to birth-death mod-
els, individual-based simulation models, and models of
adaptive dynamics. New modelling directions are en-
couraged.
The evolutionary experiments will involve the mite
Tetranychus urticae (in collaboration with Dries Bonte
at the University of Ghent, Belgium) and the bacterium
Escherichia coli (in collaboration with Joana Falcao
Salles at the University of Groningen) which are ideal
model organisms due to their short generation times.
The experiments will provide insight into how diver-38 EvolDir April 1, 2014
sity aects diversication, a great unknown in current
macro-evolutionary theory.
The theory will be applied to naturally occurring
microlandsnails in South-East Asia (in collaboration
with Menno Schilthuizen at Naturalis Biodiversity Cen-
ter, Leiden, The Netherlands), and micro-organisms
in geothermal pools in New Zealand (in collaboration
with Gavin Lear at the University of Auckland, New
Zealand).
As a general outline, for the theoretical part, both po-
tential PhD students and postdocs can apply. The mite
and microsnail projects will each require a PhD student,
the E. coli and geothermal pool projects together will
require a postdoc. However, candidates who are will-
ing and able to handle a combination of theoretical and
empirical work are particularly encouraged to apply.
Prole of candidate
The candidates should - - hold an MSc degree in ecol-
ogy or evolutionary biology, or an MSc degree in math-
ematics or physics with experience in applications to
biology - -be willing to work in a multidisciplinary team
- -have good communication skills in English (speaking
and writing)
Information and application
More information can be requested from Prof. Rampal
Etienne (r.s.etienne@rug.nl). Applications can be sent
to the same address and should contain: - Motivation
letter (max. one page) - Up-to-date CV - List of study
grades (academic transcripts)
- Names of two references
Incomplete applications will not be considered. Appli-
cations will be considered until the positions are lled.

UOslo LifeHistory Evolution
A PhD Research fellow in Ecotoxicology is available
at the Department of Biosciences, Section of Aquatic
Biology and Toxicology, Faculty of Mathematics and
Natural Sciences, University of Oslo.
The main objective of this PhD project is to investi-
gate how dierences in life history strategies aect food
web bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants.
Understanding how variations in animals' life-history
strategies inuence contaminant accumulation is a key
to address our larger goal. Life history strategies of an-
imals inhabiting Arctic waters will change with climate
change due to altered species composition, particularly
due to more southern species, with their dierent life
histories, becoming established at high latitudes, and
due to exible behavioural and life-history responses
to climate changes in true Arctic species, particularly
concerning energy storage and reproductive strategies.
The project combines knowledge from ecotoxicology,
marine biology, and evolutionary ecology. The success-
ful candidate will compile and work with large data
sets, using both statistical and mechanistic modeling.
Field studies or experiments may be conducted to com-
plement the existing data.
We seek and independent and motivated candi-
date with strong interest in (eco)toxicology, ecology
and evolutionary biology, statistics and/or ecologi-
cal/environmental modeling, and a solid academic
background. The successful candidate should have
strong quantitative skills and interests, and will be re-
quired to perform statistical and mechanistic modelling.
Prior experience with data treatment and statistics, life
history theory, and/or contaminant bioaccumulation is
relevant. The fellow will interact within a network of
researchers and students, and needs to possess collab-
orative abilities and a personality to do so. Applicants
should include a short text that outlines the candidate's
motivation and ideas for a project within the described
eld of research (1-2 pages).
The project will be conducted in collaboration with the

Primary supervisor: Dr Celine Frere, The University

Professor Janet Mann, Georgetown University, USA.
Despite a growing body of theoretical and empirical re-
search on the evolution of mammalian social systems,
the development of a unied theoretical framework re-
mains a signicant challenge. Most agree that varia-
tion in mammalian social systems can be attributed to
four main factors: predation pressure (Dunbar 1988;
van Schaik and van Hoo 1983); distributions of re-
sources (e.g. food, water, nesting sites, mates) and lev-
els of competition for them (Clutton-Brock and Har-
vey 1977; Krebs and Davies 1993); sexual selection
(Clutton-Brock and Parker 1995; Clutton-Brock 1989;
Smuts and Smuts 1993; van Schaik and Janson 2000;
van Schaik, et al. 2004); and inbreeding avoidance (Per-
rin and Mazalov 2000). While it is widely accepted
that these four factors interact with each other to in-
uence patterns of mammalian group living within and
between species (Aureli, et al. 2008; Sueur, et al. 2011),
we still know very little about whether and how the se-
lective pressures resulting from these four factors inu-
ence the spatial and temporal nature of social interac-
tions.
To better understand the ecological basis of mammalian
sociality, this PhD project will focus on the hypothe-
sis that individuals within a population can ultimately
use conspecics to balance responses to the four main
factors described above and thus increase their own t-
ness (Fr ere, et al. 2010). This hypothesis will be in-
vestigated using the long-term behavioural and genetic
dataset ( >27 years) from the bottlenose dolphin pop-
ulation found in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, West-
ern Australia. Shark Bay dolphins do not live in sta-
ble groups, but have a dynamic ssion-fusion society
characterized by frequent changes in group composi-tion (e.g., Mann et al. 2000, 2012). Underlying these
uid relationships are very strong bonds, but these too
vary. This longitudinal dataset provides us with the
unique opportunity to investigate the ways by which
female bottlenose dolphins temporally and spatially
adapt their social networks to maximize their own t-
ness.
The student will be based in the Genecolgy research
centre at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Dr
Celine Frere lab and will be co-supervised by Professor
Janet Mann from Georgetown University. It is expected
that the student will spend several months per year in
Shark Bay to conduct eld work. Please visit mon-
keymiadolphins.org for more information on the long
term study.
Applicants will need to have an extremely competitive
academic record and obtain an Australian Postgradu-
ate Award or International Research and Fee Remis-
sion Scholarships (for details and scholarship applica-
tion forms http://www.usc.edu.au/research/research-

ical developments (including NGS) to investigate the
plant community structure in a tropical forest at Kuala
Belalong Brunei Darussalam and the factors (i.e., ge-
ographic, edaphic, climatic) inuencing it. For DNA
barcoding, we will sequence plastid regions rbcL andApril 1, 2014 EvolDir 43

compared to the distribution and frequency of dierent
species to conrm the presence of phylogenetic cluster-
ing or overdispersion. Barcoded species of well repre-
sented Angiosperm families of these plots will be in-
corporated into available sequence matrices to get the
molecular phylogeny of the family concerned. Phy-
locom will be used to analyse the phylogenetic com-
munity structure and quantify community indices for
each subplot. Correlations between community indices
and ecological parameters will be examined to deter-
mine the inuence of abiotic parameters on the com-
munity structure. We will further apply a genome-
wide RAD (restriction site associated DNA) sequencing
for a detailed phylogenetic reconstruction of relation-
ships between dipterocarps and to evaluate the struc-
ture of their community. The sampling will be com-
pleted with additional accessions from other parts of

tion in adaptation.
The goal of this particular project is to use cutting-edge
techniques to characterize, quantify, map and manipu-
late meiotic recombination hotspots at unprecedented
resolution across the genome, among individuals, andbetween species. This ground-breaking research will
elucidate how a fundamental biological process shapes
the genomic basis of adaptive divergence in natural
populations. It forms part of a broader research focus in
the lab that centers around the molecular mechanisms
underlying adaptation and speciation.
Your role: You will be a central team member work-
ing closely with two postdocs and one PhD student on
this ERC funded research project. You will be respon-
sible for a variety of molecular biology assays including
preparation of complex genomic DNA libraries, cloning,

cent in situ hybridisation assays. In addition to your
own research role, you will share lab management du-
ties that include ordering and equipment maintenance
with other existing lab members.
Requirements: You should hold a Masters, or equiv-
alent degree in the areas of genetics, molecular biol-
ogy. We are looking for someone with a strong track-
record of research experience and training particularly
in genetics and molecular biology. The successful can-
didate will demonstrate experience in techniques such
as cloning, DNA library preparation, uorescent in situ
hybridisation, and yeast one hybrid assays. Passion for
research, team spirit and enthusiasm are essential. En-
glish is required.
Our Team: You will work in a multidisciplinary team
that uses population genomics, genetics, molecular, de-
velopmental, and evolutionary biology to study the
molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation and spe-
ciation in the threespine stickleback sh. Our research
group is funded by the European Research Council
(ERC) and the Max Planck Society and is located on
the Max Planck campus in Tuebingen, Germany. Our
campus hosts world-class research groups, including 7
other ERC-funded teams, and operates state-of-the-art
sequencing and other core facilities. English is the
working language. All seminars and communications
are in English.
Our Oer: The position is available for an initial 2
years with the possibility of extension to 5 years based
on performance. Salary and benets are according to
the German public service pay scale (TV oD Bund) and
are commensurate with training and experience.
The Max Planck Society seeks to increase the number of
women in areas, where they are underrepresented, and
therefore explicitly encourages women to apply. Dis-

brary preparation, exon capture, and RAD) and per-
haps data analysis (RADs, exon capture), and publish-
ing. The successful candidate could participate directly
in multiple projects. See below for information on some
of our projects (funded by NSF; USGS, and NASA).
Start Date & Duration: March 2014 (or until lled);
One Year with likely extension
(1) Project #1 Description/Summary: We need a lab
technician to help produce RAD and exon capture
data for 100s of sh for research to understand how
species and habitats will respond to climate warm-
ing. This is critical for developing sustainable manage-

inuences native salmonids (e.g., threatened Chinook
salmon, threatened bull trout, and westslope cutthroat
trout). This could involve testing for genomic signa-
tures of local adaptation and adaptation to captivity.
(2) Project#2 Summary: We need to conduct RAD-
capture and exon capture on 1000s of cutthroat trout
from many streams. We will study hybridization be-
tween native cutthroat trout and introduced rainbow
trout in the northern Rocky Mountains. Our primarygoal is to understand how genetic, evolutionary, an
ecological processes (dispersal/straying) inuence hy-
bridization within and among populations. There will
be opportunities to conduct eld work (sh trapping,
hook and line shing).
(3) Project #3 Summary: We need a lab technician
for DNA extraction from moose bones and teeth, fol-
lowed by library preparation and exon capture. An
extensive historical collection of samples will be used
to investigate genetic signatures of osteo-arthritis using
next-generation sequencing approaches.
Skills required: The technician should have experience
preparing DNA libraries for NGS analyses. Ideally, the
person would have experience conducting exon capture
or using capture arrays. Understanding of basic pop-
ulation genetics, NGS data analysis, and being able

AFLPOP question
Hi,
Does anyone know if AFLPOP outputs the probability
of assignment to each source population, or does it only
output the probability for the allocated population? I'd
like to know the probability of local assignment (to its
nominal population) for each individual.
Also, how does one specify separate populations in the
input les? It's not clear to me from the demo data,
but I'm not entirely sure these have been downloaded
correctly or that the software isn't having a problem
because of my current browser, excel and OS versions.
Any help is appreciated.Thanks, Shannon

Dear friends, As you may know, our dear friend andApril 1, 2014 EvolDir 69
colleague Fred Allendorf has been through a tragedy.
Last Friday, February 28, an avalanche was triggered
in a gully on Mount Jumbo that ends at the home
where Fred, Michel (his wife), and children have lived
for over 20 years. The avalanche demolished the home,
and buried Fred, Michel, and an 8-year old boy from
a neighboring house. All three people were recovered
from the snow and wreckage in the following hours, and
rushed to the hospital. The boy, Phoenix, has since
been released from the hospital. Fred remains in seri-
ous condition with 17 broken ribs, several broken ver-
tebrae, and some internal bleeding, but prospects for
his recovery are good. Sadly, Michel passed away on
Sunday night. Michel was the rst woman to earn a
degree in Wildlife Biology at the University of Mon-
tana after it became an interdisciplinary program in
1965. She was a wonderful, caring, and adventurous
person. She will be sorely missed by all who knew her,
and it breaks all of our hearts to think of what Fred
is going through. Since the avalanche, there has been
a wave of support for Fred and Michel from people all
over the world. This support means a lot to Fred, and
will continue to be important in the coming days and
weeks. Also, \The Allendorf Family Fund" has been
established for those wishing to make nancial contri-
butions to help Fred and his family recover. Donations
can be made directly at any branch of the Missoula
Federal Credit Union (MFCU), sent to MFCU at 3600
Brooks St., Missoula MT 59801, made over the phone
by calling (406) 523-3300, or by e-banking to MFCU
account 277580. You can also make contact through
the \Contact Us" link on the MFCU website, http://-

It is with great sadness that we have to report to
the evolution community the death of Professor Bryan
Clarke FRS on Thursday, the 27th February 2014.
Bryan Clarke was a leader in our understanding of the
process of evolution for more than four decades. He
made fundamental contributions, both empirical and
theoretical, particularly in elucidating the forces that
maintain genetic variation in populations, and in throw-
ing light on the process of speciation.
Bryan was born on the 24th June 1932, and, following
service in the Royal Air Force, was educated at Mag-
dalen College Oxford, from where he received both his
BA in 1956 and DPhil in 1961. From 1959 to 1971 he
worked at the University of Edinburgh, starting as As-
sistant Lecturer and rising to a Readership. In 1971
he was the Foundation Professor at the new Depart-
ment of Genetics at the University of Nottingham, and
remained until 1997, when he became Professor Emer-
itus.
The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selec-
tion identies genetic dierences in populations - poly-
morphisms, as the key to evolutionary change. It is
of fundamental interest whether polymorphisms are af-
fected by natural selection, or solely by genetic drift.
Bryan's research focussed on polymorphisms in snails,
including members of the genus Cepaea, the shells of
which vary greatly in colour and in their banding pat-
terns. While some had naively suggested that this
variation might have no eect on the organisms' t-
ness, earlier experiments and observations, from Cain
and Sheppard in particular, had demonstrated that
these variants were indeed subject to natural selec-
tion. But, if there is selection operating on this ge-
netic variation, why does the population not come to
consist of only a single, best-adapted, type? The an-
swer is that selection can, in some circumstances, main-
tain variation rather than destroying it. One mecha-
nism for the maintenance of genetic variation is het-
erozygote advantage, which explains, for example, the
high frequency of the allele causing sickle cell anaemia.
Bryan knew that the patterns of inheritance of the poly-
morphisms in Cepaea could not be explained by het-
erozygote advantage. Rather, he was able to demon-
strate that these are maintained by a dierent mecha-
nism, frequency-dependent selection, in which the t-70 EvolDir April 1, 2014
ness of genetic types increases if their frequencies in the
population diminish, thereby creating a stable equilib-
rium in which multiple genetic types are maintained.
His studies of frequency-dependent selection were able
to demonstrate the near-ubiquity of this phenomenon
when visible polymorphisms are studied in wild pop-
ulations, and also showed the selective agents which
brought this about. The frequencies of polymorphic
variants in snails can vary greatly in space, without
any obvious environmental correlates. An important
and inuential step in the understanding of such \area
eects" came from Bryan's models of morph-ratio clines
in his 1966 American Naturalist paper.
Studies of visible polymorphisms were augmented, from
the 1960s, by the study of polymorphisms in the
amino acid sequences in proteins, investigated initially
through electrophoretic detection of dierences in the
electric change on enzyme molecules. As with the
visual polymorphisms in Cepaea, some assumed that
the changes were invisible to natural selection. Bryan
Clarke advocated the view that a large proportion of
the changes were indeed subject to natural selection
and demonstrated experimental support for this view,
particularly for variants in the enzyme alcohol dehy-
drogenase in Drosophila melanogaster. The study of
selection acting on polymorphic dierences in amino
acid sequences is a direct way to obtain evidence about
whether the long-term evolution of the amino acid
sequences of proteins is shaped by natural selection.
Some believe that protein evolution is almost com-
pletely dominated by random forces in which the suc-
cessful variants were so not because of the advantages
they gave to their bearers, but as a result of genetic
drift. Bryan Clarke was one of the main advocates of
the view that a large part of the evolutionary changes
in the amino acid sequences of proteins were indeed
driven by Darwinian natural selection, a view that re-
sults from large-scale DNA sequencing are conrming
in many species.
Bryan Clarke also played a large part in developing
our understanding of the process through which species
form. He carried out a long-term study of species of
the land snail Partula on the South Pacic island of
Moorea and neighbouring islands. He appreciated that,
in the early stages of speciation, matings between mem-
bers of populations undergoing speciation do not stop
instantly- some hybridisation persists. Species stay dis-
tinct notwithstanding there being some gene ow be-
tween them. Thus, selectively important genetic dier-
ences between species, such as those determining form,
colour and behaviour, are maintained as

CLUMPP and DISTRUCT
Does anyone have a user-friendly way of inputting data
into CLUMPP and DISTRUCT?
CLUMPP averages results across STRUCTURE simu-
lations once K has been selected, and DISTRUCT pro-
duces the STRUCTURE gure.
The challenge is that both are command-line programs,
and DISTRUCT mac version seems broken (however, I
assume PC version is OK).
Dent Earl and Bridgett vonHoldt produced an great so-
lution for processing STRUCTURE output. A similar
solution for CLUMPP and DISTRUCT would be most
welcome.

Fst Structure answers
Dear all,
I recently posted this question:
I'm working on population genetics of reef shes; I've
used microsatellite loci to detect population structure
and I've found signicant Fst value among dierent
sampling locations. However, when running STRUC-
TURE I failed nding any partition among samples.
Does anybody has a clue about why is this happen-ing??
Answers are listed below:
Answers
1) with polymorphic enough data, Fst tests are pow-
erful to detect weak dierentiation between a priori
groups. STRUCTURE tries to nd a structure in a
dataset without a priori groups, which is much more
challenging, and will often fail when the Fst between
real groups is too low (e.g. Fst <0.03).
2) Your experience is not unique. For example, we re-
cently published a paper in Molecular Ecology on our
work on collared lizards. We found signicant isola-
tion by distance and an fst, but STRUCTURE gave
us nothing. We then used a dierent Bayesian assign-
ment program that also incorporates spatial informa-
tion, BAPS, and got beautiful results. In this case,
I had translocated these populations into an area in
which they had gone extinct, and we have followed in
detail their entire colonization and dispersal history for
over 30 years. BAPS reconstructed this known history
very accurately. The BAPS results are in our paper
(Neuwald, J. L., and A. R. Templeton. 2013. Genetic
restoration in the eastern collared lizard under pre-
scribed woodland burning. Molecular Ecology 22:3666-
3679). Right now I'm in Israel working on an endan-
gered salamander. When we applied STRUCTURE to
our data, we got just two divisions (the Galilee and
Mt. Carmel, which are isolated from one another and
show extreme genetic dierentiation). However, when
we applied BAPS, in addition to this major subdivi-
sion, it subdivided the Galilee into 10 subpopulations,
all of which made excellent sense given the topography
of the area and our previous studies on dispersal. Us-
ing these 10 subpopulations, we had highly signicant
results with fst and AMOVA - all completely invisible
to STRUCTURE.
I have also had experience with STRUCTURE in my
work in human genetics, and have found I can get just
about any result I want by playing with K, which is
notoriously hard to estimate in a statistically meaning-
ful fashion. I truly do not understand the popularity of
STRUCTURE. I advise you to simply avoid its use, and
go to other programs such as BAPS. A non-parametric
alternative that has been used mostly in the human
genetic literature is with the program Awclust (http:/-
/awclust.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html).
3)My guess is that you are looking at two dierent
scales in your data (also I am not sure what param-
eters you used in structure) - if you nd a local struc-
ture (it could be that your individuals are more related
and then detect signicant Fst between populations)April 1, 2014 EvolDir 73
whereas you have enough migration (in the sense of ge-
netic exchange) between groups which lead structure to
consider your population as panmictic.
I would suggest that you have a look at: Gaure B,
Estoup A, Bretagnolle V, Cosson JF (2008) Spatial ge-
netic structure of a small rodent in a heterogeneous
landscape. Mol Ecol 17:4619-4629 and maybe who cites
this paper.
4)Personally I only use Bayesian clustering when I am
desperate, e.g. I suspect strong FIS to come from
Wahlund eects but have no clue to nd the origin of it.
The assumptions of panmixia and Linkage equilibrium
(the last being impossible to reach in real populations),
and also because I really do not understand what these
kind of softwares really do, are constraints that make
me quite reluctant. I prefer using old stus that are
directly connected to demography in a way I can un-
derstand.
In your case, you might have a continuous (or nearly so)
increase of dierentiation with some factor(s), the most
obvious being geographic distance. You might also have
multi-hierarchical levels. All factors that might prevent
STRUCTURE nding anything.
Try to study isolation by distance and, if it works, you
will get much more information than STRUCTURE
will ever give you.
A good thing also is checking that all your loci be-
have the same (for both FST and FIS). If one or two
loci display unusual behaviour as compared to all oth-
ers, this might represent the signature of some technical
or non-neutral factors that may also disturb STRUC-
TURE functioning.
5)Fst can become signicant also for very small value if
the sample size turns larger. In fact, and that is true for
most statistical applications, if you increase your sam-
ple size enough you get signicant results eventually -
even though they will be biologically irrelevant.
It is dicult to evaluate your question without having
seen your structure results, or knowing your runtime
settings. Maybe you have performed

Dear Friends,
I am teaching Biostatistics for Biology students and
I would like to explore human evolution during the
classes. I would like to compare skull measurements
from apes, fossil hominids and modern humans and also
explore skull evolution by using simple linear models. I

textbooks but I don't know.
My idea is always to bring new data and ideas for the

using a more applied approach is creating much more
interest among them.

Indel aa selection
Dear Brian and Evoldir,
During a class, I was asked to show some examples of
insertions in the protein level during evolution. The
idea is to show some examples of aa insertions that will
be easily visible in a pairwise alighment (e.g. human -
mouse) and will have some functional role.
I tried to nd such examples using google, blast etc.
but it doesn't see to be such a trivial task. Could you
please suggest any specic examples that clearly show
insertions (or deletions) in the alignment of a homolo-
gous protein between two species and this indel to have
a functional role?74 EvolDir April 1, 2014
kind regards, pavlos

semesters. KBS will provide Visiting Scholars with
desk space in the academic building and family-friendly
housing in the Caretakers Cottage on the KBS grounds
for visits of one to eight weeks. Visiting Scholars can
use their time at KBS to pursue collaborations with
KBS and other MSU faculty and to work on their own
projects. The KBS environment provides an ideal place
for scholars to pursue new and ongoing projects away
from the distractions of their home institutions. Vis-
iting Scholars are expected to give a research seminar
and otherwise participate in the academic life of the
KBS community while in residence.
To apply, rst identify and contact a KBS faculty mem-
ber to serve as a host. Then send to vistingschol-
ars@kbs.msu.edu your CV and a letter explaining the
goals of your visit, how you might contribute to the
KBS academic environment while in residence, and a
range of dates youre available. Indicate any specicneeds (research or housing) you may have. Arrange to
have your KBS faculty host send a letter to the same ad-
dress in support of your visit. Preference will be given
to applicants with the most potential to contribute to
KBS academic life (research expertise, potential for col-
laborative research, oering a short course or public
lecture, etc.). Visiting Scholars should have a Ph.D. or
equivalent experience.
Applications for visits for Fall Semester 2014 (Octo-
ber 1-December 19, 2014) are due April 1, 2014, with

OmennPrize EvolutionMedicine 2
The Evolution, Medicine, & Public Health Foundation
(http://evolutionarymedicine.org) invites nominations
for the Omenn Prize for the best article published in
2013 in any scientic journal on a topic related to evo-
lution in the context of medicine and public health.
The $5000 prize is made possible by a generous dona-
tion from Gilbert S Omenn. It will be awarded in April
2014 to the rst author of the winning article.
Any relevant peer-reviewed article is eligible, but the
prize is intended for work that uses evolutionary prin-
ciples to advance understanding of a disease or disease
process. The prize committee will give priority to arti-
cles with implications for human health, but many basic
science or theoretical articles have such implications.
Nominations should include a copy of the article (if
distribution is permitted) or an abstract and link76 EvolDir April 1, 2014
to the article, and a brief nominating statement
(<250 words) in the body of an email to Omen-
nPrize@evolutionarymedicine.org. Authors are encour-
aged to nominate their own articles, but nominations
of articles by others are also welcome.
The Prize Committee is chaired by Allen Rodrigo, and
its members are Carl Bergstrom and Sarah Tishko.
Papers by committee members, their students and lab
group members are not eligible, and articles by their
co-authors or close associates are subject to special con-
ditions.
Nominations will be accepted at Omen-
nPrize@evoluitonarymedicine.org until 5pm, 28
February, 2014 US Eastern Standard Time.

Other phylogenetics evolution
resources
Dear Evoldir list subscribers,
As an \old school" mailing list user who has had the
same email address since 1984, I still think traditional
mail lists such as this one can have advantages over
newer and theoretically better technologies such as
wikis, \chat rooms", social media services and so on.
However, one of the best parts of a mail list is main-
taining a \user culture" that maintains traditions in the
group. One example that seems to be slipping away in
the evoldir list is having users ask a good question, the
members send answers or suggestions to that user and
then after a week or so the user replies back to the
whole list with a summary of the best replies.
In recent years, several other phylogenetics/evolution
groups have become available, but I am not sure any
can replace evoldir just yet. Some examples are:
phylobabble.org New site with participation from quite
a few very good software developers, such as the
RAXML and BEAST developers.
http://treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html Site fordepositing phylogenetic trees and the data used to build
the trees. Does not have a \discussion group" section.
https://www.researchgate.net/home.Home.html Re-
searchGate has discussions on phylogenetics, evolution
and other topics, but so far tends to be dominated by
low level questions and not very well-informed answers.
The user groups for each software package, such
as http://groups.google.com/group/beast-users/topics
http://groups.google.com/group/raxml/topics are of
course limited to discussion only of the use of one pack-
age each.
http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/ The TreeThinkers
group seems to have a very good thing going with their
wiki, but I am not sure it has the \critical mass" to
really expand, and it also seems to be designed speci-
cally for this group's own phylogenetics workshops and
not inviting public input.
http://www.mendeley.com/groups/726401/-
phylogenetics-discussion-group/ Mendeley seems
to have a lot of potential for serving discussion groups,
but there are several phlylogenetics and evolution
groups in it, and none of them are so far getting the
critical mass needed to become the \go to" place for
phylogeny discussions.
If I have missed what any of you consider to be one
of the best places to share phylogenetics and evolution
discussions, please add to my list.

Pyrenees VolFieldAssist EvolBiol
Field assistants summer 2014: Volunteer positions in
evolutionary biology
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and
Technology (IST) Austria requires volunteers to assist
with eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees
(Spain) this coming summer (June - July).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary dy-
namics underlying species diversication in the genus
Antirrhinum (snapdragons). We are using ecological,
molecular and population genetic tools to investigate
the dynamics of speciation in hybrid zones between two
species with dierent ower colours. At the eld site,
our main goal is to build a long-term pedigree for the
population, which involves mapping the location of in-
dividual plants (GPS), tagging and sampling them for
leaves and owers, measuring quantitative traits and
processing leaves for later DNA extraction. There may
also be opportunities to be involved other tasks such
as work we are doing on plant-pollinator interactions.
Most of the work is outdoors, however we do spend
some time indoors processing samples. The work is
highly team orientated. This is a great opportunity for
anybody looking to obtain experience in eld work re-
lating to evolutionary biology, plant ecology and plant-
animal interactions. You will also be part of a large
multidisciplinary team including researchers from IST
Austria (Vienna), John Innes Centre (Norwich, UK)
and the University of Toulouse.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees of Northern Eastern Spain (Catalo-
nia). We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking
a picturesque valley, with close access to hiking trails
and small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(within Europe) are covered. However, we cannot oer
any further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students with a strong interest in
working outdoors with plants. You must also be com-
fortable working as part of a team. Experience with
eld-based projects and plants is preferred but not es-
sential.
We require assistance between early June and the end
of July. Length of stay is exible but a minimum stay
of 3 weeks is required.How to apply? Please send by the closing date of 14th
April, a statement of your background, CV, why you
are interested and the length of time you would be avail-
able via email to:

Question phylogenetic comparative
methods
Dear EvolDir community,
I am a biological anthropologist working on the func-
tional morphology of
human and non-human primates. I am interested in
learning how to use phylogenetic comparative methods
to analyse morphological traits. I deal with continuous
traits that may span from articular and/or diaphyseal
linear dimensions, indices and cross-sectional geometric78 EvolDir April 1, 2014
properties.
In particular, I need to learn how: 1) to add fossils to
an already
built phylogenetic tree (given that primate phylogenies
can be already found on the 10kTrees website); 2) how
to use the tree/trees to compare
the morphological traits I collected.
I was advised by some colleagues to look into the soft-
ware Mesquite for the rst task and into R for the sec-
ond one. I have been trying to learn by myself how to
solve the problem but I have failed so far.
I was wondering if anybody is willing to give me advises
as for how to perform these analyses and/or collaborate
on the papers where they are necessary.
Any help is welcome!

Software Bayesian
analysesofMacroevolution BAMM
Evoldir community:
We announce the release of BAMM and BAMMtools,
a Bayesian framework for the analysis of speciation,
extinction, and trait evolution on phylogenetic trees
(www.bamm-project.org). BAMM is oriented entirely
towards detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in evo-
lutionary rates. It uses reversible jump Markov chain
Monte Carlo to automatically explore a large number
of candidate models of lineage diversication and trait
evolution. BAMM is a command line program written
in C++.
We have also created BAMMtools, an R package for the
analysis and visualization of BAMM output. The pack-
age is available for installation via CRAN or through
the project website.
BAMM / BAMMtools functionality includes a number
of novel methods for visualization and analysis of com-April 1, 2014 EvolDir 79
plex macroevolutionary dynamics, including:
- Inference on evolutionary rate variation through time
and among clades - Visualization of dynamic rates
on phylogenetic trees with BAMMtools - Estimation
of credible sets of macroevolutionary rate congura-
tions - Estimation of the \best" (maximum a poste-

- Bayes factors for inferring numbers of evolutionary
rate regimes on phylogenies - Summarize marginal dis-
tributions of evolutionary rates for individual clades -
Analyze diversication rates with incomplete and phy-
logenetically non-random taxon sampling
The documentation includes a graph gallery illustrat-
ing some of data visualizations and analyses that can be

and with any number of replicates for each K, and pro-
vides a full pipeline for clustering, summarizing, and
visualizing these results. The Evanno method is also
implemented by CLUMPAK. Our paper will be sub-

provides the most widely used evolutionary models and
implements proposals similar to (and as ecient as)
MrBayes.
ExaBayes allows for ecient parallel analyses on any

of ExaBayes lies on scalability: we managed to compute
a tree from a genome-size alignment (200 taxa, 2*10E8

more, we successfully tested our code on alignments
with up to 10,000 partitions.

Software pophelper R package
I work with population genetics and population struc-
ture of honey bees. Therefore I had been writing some
R scripts for my personal use and someone recently sug-
gested that I make it into a package that can be shared.
Therefore I have recently put together some useful stu
into an R package called pophelper.
Basically, this R package does what STRUCTURE
HARVESTER does. pophelper works with structure
and TESS output les. I think it may be useful for
people working with STRUCTURE, TESS and R. This
package requires some basic R skills to use. pophelper
can be used to tabulate runs, summarise them, perform
Evanno method, export to CLUMPP format, generate
barplot gures etc.
The package can be installed from github for the mo-
ment. Once a stable version is established, it will be
uploaded to CRAN.
https://github.com/royfrancis/pophelper I would very
much appreciate if you could share this with the
community. I am also hoping people are will-
ing to give this a try and provide some feed-
back/comments/suggestions/criticisms etc. Feel free
to contact me at roy.m.francis@outlook.com if you run
into any issues or have any questions etc.

SmallMammalEvolution
Several volunteers needed from July / August 2014 on-
wards
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to eco-physiology, animal behavior, evolution, and
ecology before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral
observations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how
blood samples are collected for physiological measure-
ments. Volunteers are expected to help with mainte-
nance of the research station (water pump, solar power,
etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-

PostDoc:AMU Poznan.ModellingMhcEvolution
Evolutionary Biology Group of Professor Jacek Rad-
wan at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, is looking
for a Post-Doc in an NCN-funded project investigating
evolution of MHC copy number using both empirical
and theoretical approaches. The post-doc will perform
computer simulations exploring alternative evolution-
ary mechanisms potentially shaping the number of ex-
pressed MHC genes.
The candidate should hold PhD degree in biological
sciences, computer sciences or mathematics and should
have signicant achievements in theoretical modelling
of biological processes, documented by publications in
international scientic journals. Competence in com-
puter programming is essential.
The employment is oered for three years, starting ide-

Postdoc: AMU Poznan UEA CardiU.MHCEvolutionGuppyPost-doc position in evolutionary biology is available
for three years, preferably starting from 1st June 2014
in a project \Testing new MHC allele advantage in
semi-natural populations of the guppy, Poecillia retic-
ulata". This collaborative project is led by Professor
Jacek Radwan (Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan),
Dr Cock van Oosterhout (University of East Anglia)
and Dr Joanne Cable (Cardi University, School of
Biosciences), and is funded by Polish Science Centre
(NCN).
Genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex
(MHC), involved in parasite recognition, are crucial for
the adaptive immune response in vertebrates. While
theories explaining maintenance of MHC polymorphism
have been proposed decades ago, empirical tests of some
of the most inuential hypotheses are scant. Most no-
tably, predictions about frequency-dependent selection
(i.e. the hypothesis that rare MHC alleles should be
selected for because fast-evolving parasites will adapt
to evade immune recognition by common MHC alle-
les) have not been rigorously tested. The aim of this
project is to test crucial predictions of this hypothesis
using semi-natural populations of the guppy, Poecilia
reticulata. The project will be based on Tobago and
will use mesocosm setups to trace frequencies of MHC
alleles, and infection levels associated with them, over
several generations.
The post-doc will be will be responsible for running the
eld experiment, which will imply his/her stay at To-
bago during the rst year of the project and recurrent
trips in the second and third year. He will collaborate
with other team members and with a PhD student who
will be responsible for molecular work.
The candidate should hold PhD degree in biological sci-
ences and should have signicant achievements in evolu-
tionary biology, ecology as documented by publications
in international scientic journals. S/he should be able
to work well as part of a team, have good planning,
analytical, statistical and writing skills, and should be
ready to work hard in the eld. Experience in eld
work will be considered an advantage.

Belgium CichlidSpeciation
Deadline extended to March 31st 2014
The Royal Belgian Museum for Natural Sciences is
looking for a: Post doctoral researcher April 2014 -
February 2018
Summary :
The successful candidate will work in the framework of
a 4 year project nanced by the Belgian science pol-
icy, Belspo. Belspo Brain project: \Behavioral and
genomic aspects of cichlid speciation; GENBAS - GE-
Netic Basis for Speciation". The proposal's two main
objectives are to characterize the genomic dierentia-
tion that drives the speciation process, and to verify
whether/and to what extent the same genomic changes
are involved in to maintain the ^ aintegrity' of the gene
pools of the resulting sister species.April 1, 2014 EvolDir 87
We intend to address this question through a dual ap-
proach: one that compares the genome wide dierenti-
ation within and between sister species, and one that
explores the genetic basis of the behavioural aspects
(display and acoustic signalling during courtship) that
allow female shes to dierentiate between con-specic
and hetero-specic males. For this purpose, we have
selected the Lake Tanganyika cichlid genus Ophthal-
motilapia. More specically, our experimental design
involves the combination of four studies: (1) to ex-
plore behavioural and acoustic aspects of mate pair-
ing during con- and hetero-specic interactions among
species; (2) to investigate dierential gene expression
in the female brain associated with pairing behaviour
during con- and hetero-specic interactions; (3) to elu-
cidate genetic dierences within and among relatively
recently diverged and hybridizing species at a genome-
wide level; and (4) to examine whether the part of the
genome that is expressed during mate recognition in
the brains of the female cichlids correspond with one
or more of the genomic areas with increased dieren-
tiation within or among these species. The project is
a collaboration between Erik Verheyen (RBINS), Jos
Snoeks (RMCA), Jeroen Van Houdt (KULeuven), Eric
Parmentier & Pascal Poncin (ULi ege).

PlantEpidemiologyModeling
Dear colleagues,
A postdoctoral position on forest epidemiology model-
ing is available at the Agroclim (INRA, Avignon) and
Tree/Microorganism Interactions laboratories (INRA,
Nancy) in France.
The Agroclim and Tree/Microorganism Interactions
(IAM) laboratories are seeking a highly-qualied post-
doctoral researcher to work on a joint project assess-
ing the impacts of climate change on the establishment
and development of crop and forest pathosystems in
France. Climate change largely questions food security,
but its impact on fungal diseases has been under ex-
plored, resulting in poor anticipation by management
strategies designed to limit epidemics. The most sig-
nicant work on climate change's impact on diseases in
France is related to forests, with INRA already having
developed research models resulting in a ne descrip-
tion of plant x pathogen x climate interactions, as well
as operational approaches largely used in forest health
to identify and quantify the risks associated to future
bioclimatic niches. The main objective of this post-
doctoral appointment will be to improve these existing
models and use them on a country-wide scale in or-
der to identify areas favorable to the development of92 EvolDir April 1, 2014
selected diseases, both for present and for future cli-
mates. This will be done for two forest foliar pathogens
(Dothistroma Needle Blight disease on laricio pine and
Diplodia pinea on pine) and two soft and durum wheat
aerial fungi (stem and leaf rusts).
The successful candidate should hold a PhD with a
background in epidemiology or agronomy/forestry, and
also have experience in modeling. Excellent writ-
ten and spoken skills in French or English are a
must. The project is part of the larger framework
of the newly started research network CLIF (Climate
change and fungal diseases) within the INRA meta-
programme, Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to
Climate Change. The successful candidate would join
a group of approximately 30 scientists, including two
international leaders in the eld. The appointment
is for two years, with a provisional start date of July
2014. The candidate's time would be split between the
two labs, with 15 months spent at the Agroclim unit
in Avignon (http://www6.paca.inra.fr/agroclim) and 9
months at the Tree/Microorganism Interactions unit in
Nancy (http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/IAM/)
Candidates must send their CV and a cover let-
ter to Marie Launay (Agroclim, Avignon) mlau-

Two postdoctoral positions are available in the Jones
Lab at the Max Planck Institute in Tuebingen as part
of a prestigious 2M EURO European Research Coucil
grant investigating the role of meiotic recombination in
adaptive evolution in stickleback sh.
The goal of our research is to use cutting-edge tech-
niques to characterize, quantify, map and manipulate
meiotic recombination hotspots at unprecedented reso-
lution across the genome, among individuals, and be-
tween species. We will study its genomic co-localization
with kilobase resolution maps of adaptive loci and study
the eects of recombination variation on individual t-
ness in the lab and in the eld. This ground-breaking
research will elucidate how a fundamental biological
process shapes the genomic basis of adaptive divergence
in natural vertebrate populations.
Postdoc1: Computational and Statistical Genomics of
Recombination & Adaptation
Your role: You will use computational and statistical
genetic methods to build ultra high-resolution maps of
recombination hotspots across the genome and quan-
tify variation in these maps among individuals, between
sexes & divergent species. You will intersect these maps
with adaptive loci including those you identify from
population genomic analyses of species-pairs to investi-
gate how recombination shapes adaptive evolution.
Requirements: You will have a PhD or equivalent de-gree, in Biostatistics, Bioinformatics or Statistical Ge-
netics, or several years of experience in these elds. You
should demonstrate expertise and prociency in han-
dling large-scale computational data analyses, and ad-
vanced skills in statistical inference (e.g. genotype im-
putation, Hidden Markov Models, and haplotype phas-
ing of whole genome data). Experience with unix and
coding in C, C++, Python, or Perl is essential. We are
interested in candidates who are keen to apply new and
innovative statistical approaches. Passion for research,
team spirit and enthusiasm are essential.
Our Team: You will work in a multidisciplinary team
that uses population genomics, genetics, molecular, de-
velopmental, and evolutionary biology to study the
molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation and spe-
ciation in the threespine stickleback sh. Our research
group is funded by the European Research Council
(ERC) and the Max Planck Society and is located on
the Max Planck campus in Tuebingen, Germany. Our
campus hosts world-class research groups, including 7
other ERC-funded teams, and operates state-of-the-art
sequencing and other core facilities. English is the
working language. All seminars and communications

GenomeBioinformatics
Positions in genome bioinformatics
Two positions at the PhD/Master student and postdoc
level are available for developing new algorithms and
strategies for analysis of second- and third-generation
sequencing data, and for using these data to study a
wide array of biological questions, with an emphasis
on genome assemblies, annotation and genome compar-
isons. Initial appointments for PhD students and post-
docs will normally be for three years. The positions are
available immediately.
Candidates will have demonstrated experience in se-
quence and genome analyses, with at least some
knowledge of primary short read analysis and
genome/transcriptome annotation. Proven skills in atleast one major programming or scripting language
(PERL/PYTHON, Java, C/C++) and Linux/Unix
computing environment (Bourne/Bash shell scripting)
are a must. Good understanding of molecular biology,
experience with assemblies and familiarity with bio-
statistics including knowledge of R are a plus.
The lab comprises a mix of computational scientists, bi-
ologists with strong bioinformatics skills and molecular
biologists. It provides unique opportunities, as the lab
is not only very well funded, but bioinformaticians are
also involved in designing genomic analyses from day
one, and often propose their own project ideas. Our
work in this and other areas routinely results in high-
prole publications, making it an extraordinary place
for talented and ambitious students and postdocs.
The lab has been an early adopter of next generation
sequencing technologies and has used these for diverse
applications, from studying de novo mutations and
epimutations to being the rst to ne-map and iden-
tify a causal mutation using bulk segregant sequencing
(Schneeberger et al., Nature Methods 2009; Ossowski
et al., Science 2010; Becker et al., Nature 2011). A
major eort is in understanding within- and between-
species sequence variation, using both resequencing and
de novo assembly strategies (Cao et al., Nature Genet-
ics 2011; Hu et al., Nature Genetics 2011; Slotte et
al., Nature Genetics 2013). A agship project is the
1001 Genomes project for Arabidopsis thaliana (http:/-
/1001genomes.org). In this area, we have already gath-
ered experience with PacBio data and will have early
access to nanopore sequencing.
We are working closely with other groups that are pri-
marily informatically oriented. These include Daniel
Huson (Univ. Tuebingen), Bernhard Sch olkopf (Max
Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tuebingen)
and Karsten Borgwardt (currently Max Planck, soon
ETH Zurich/Basel). Additional information on the
group, the institute, and Tuebingen can be found on
our website (http://weigelworld.org).
For Master and PhD students, we expect that you can
provide at least two letters of reference and that you
describe in detail your practical programming experi-
ence.
For postdocs, we expect that you have published (or are
close to publishing) at least one rst-author paper in a
major international journal. Please send a letter that
outlines which projects you are particularly interested
in.
For both graduates students and postdocs, we hope to
see a cover letter that details how your experience and
interest would t with the projects outlined above.April 1, 2014 EvolDir 97

UOtago NZ Molecular basis
sexreversal sh
Postdoctoral Opportunity
Fixed term, Three years
The molecular basis of sex reversal in sequentially
hermaphroditic sh We are currently seeking an out-
standing postdoctoral researcher with interests in ge-
netics, evolution, physiology and behavioural ecology
to conduct research into the genetic basis of sex rever-
sal in sequentially hermaphroditic sh.
Project Description: Most plants and animals irre-
versibly dierentiate becoming either males or females.
However, in some groups, notably shes, individuals
begin life as one sex and reverse sex sometime later
in response to social cues (sequential hermaphrodism).
Sex reversal in sequential hermaphrodites is complete,
entailing radical restructuring of the gonad, alterations
in morphology, and modications to behaviour. The
molecular basis of this stunning transformation is un-
known, but is of intense interest, not only as a means
to enhance our understanding of sex determination
and dierentiation, cellular commitment and tissue re-
engineering, but also as a spectacular example of pheno-
typic plasticity in response to environment. Using the
ubiquitous NZ spotty, together with two distant trop-
ical relatives, the bluehead and three-spotted wrasse,
both leading models for sex reversal, we will undertake
a series of experiments to determine the genetic path-
way underlying this stunning transformation. We will
couple in the eld ecological manipulations to produce
a time series of samples taken during the process of sex
reversal, with state-of-the-art gene expression analyses
and comparative genomic approaches, to identify both
the primary trigger and subsequent genetic cascade that
results in female-male sex reversal in shes.The project emerges from a new Marsden Grant headed
by Professor Neil Gemmell and will be based in the
Gemmell laboratory at the University of Otago.
The Ideal Candidate: Applications are invited from
postdoctoral candidates who have experience in molec-
ular biology, evolutionary and population genet-
ics/genomics, and bioinformatics. The successful can-
didate will likely be skilled in molecular genetic tech-
niques and in the analysis of genetic data and asso-
ciated statistics. They will be highly self-motivated
and be able to work alongside a wide variety of peo-
ple. In addition they will have a strong commitment to
research excellence with a track record of high research
productivity based on international, peer-reviewed pub-
lications commensurate for their career stage.
How to Apply: Interested applicants are encouraged
to make informal enquiries to Professor Neil Gemmell.

School of Biological Sciences has over 30 academic sta
members who are active in teaching, research, and have
outstanding international reputations.
Applications are sought for a Postdoctoral Research As-
sociate positions to participate in a new research pro-
gramme investigating the evolution of virulence in viral
pathogens, using caliciviruses of rabbits as a model sys-
tem. The project is funded by an Australian Research
Council Discovery Grant held by Professor Edward C.
Holmes (NHMRC Australia Fellow).
Rabbit Haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a cali-
civirus that is used widely in Australia and New
Zealand to control overabundant rabbits, a major en-
vironmental and economic pest. It is an example of
an emerging disease that likely evolved from a non-
virulent predecessor via mutation into an extremely vir-
ulent virus. However, the nature of these mutations
remains unknown. The rst part of the project will
involve sequencing of large numbers of non-pathogenic
and pathogenic calicivirus sequences for genetic anal-
ysis, aimed at identifying the likely ^ agenetic switches'
responsible for the acquisition of virulence and tissue
tropism. The second part of the project will involve the
design and development of recombinant viral genomesin order to deactivate the proposed genetic switches,
and the subsequent testing of these viruses in the rab-
bit host.
This is an outstanding opportunity to further develop
your research career in a specialised eld under the
guidance and mentoring of highly regarded research
academics. As this is a collaborative project with
CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in Canberra, you will be
largely based in Canberra for the laboratory work.
To succeed you will have: - a PhD and a record of pub-
lished research as sole author or in collaboration on a
related subject area (e.g. virology, molecular evolution,
biocontrol)
- strong demonstrated skills in molecular biology and
virology with a good understanding of the key aspects
of virus biology
- demonstrated experience in planning, conducting and
interpreting next-generation sequencing data and anal-
yses
- experience in Bioinformatic analysis (i.e. computa-
tional biology) of gene and genome sequences
- keen interest in phylogenetic analysis, bioinformatics
and evolutionary biology
- willingness to work with laboratory animals for re-
search purposes
- demonstrated ability to conduct research/scholarly ac-
tivities under limited supervision either independently
or as a member of a team, and to facilitate collabora-
tions with other research groups
- good written and verbal communication skills, experi-
ence in research record keeping, preparation of research
papers and seminars.
The position is full-time xed term for three years sub-

ModellingEcologicalSpeciation114 EvolDir April 1, 2014
Postdoctoral Scholarship (2 years) for Modelling of Eco-
logical Speciation - Ume a University
The Department of Ecology and Environmental Sci-
ence (EMG) www.emg.umu.se and Integrated science
Lab (Icelab) www.org.umu.se/icelab is oering a post-
doctoral scholarship within the project 'Speciation in
action'.
Project description This project is focused on the in-
terplay between ecology and evolution. The goal of
the project is to understand the ip side of ecologi-
cal speciation. As speciation is occurring in the fo-
cal species, the food web can be modied as the focal
species changes its mechanisms of predator avoidance
or its diet. The postdoc will be involved in building
a general theoretical model that includes the within-
species diversication, the impacts on the food web, and
the feedback between the two. Collaboration with the
empirically oriented research group of Professor G oran
Englund is possible if the successful candidate is inter-
ested to model diversication in Scandinavian whitesh
populations.
Requirements To qualify for the scholarship you should
have a PhD degree in evolutionary biology, or equiva-
lent, not more than 3 years old. Knowledge of popula-
tion genetics and modelling of ecological and evolution-
ary dynamics is highly desirable. In-depth knowledge
of an empirical system tting the project description
would also be an asset. From the successful candidate,
we expect a documented capability of cooperative scien-
tic research work and skills in writing scientic publi-
cations in English. International applicants are encour-
aged to apply.
The fellow will be based at Icelab and the Department
of Ecology and Environmental Science in Ume a, andis nanced through a personal scholarship from the
Kempe Foundations.
Application The application should include a short de-
scription of your research interests and why you are
interested in the scholarship, a CV, a publication list,
copies of exam certicates (ocial copies are not nec-
essary for the application, but may be required at the
time of hire), and contact information of 3 reference
persons. The application should be written in English
and should be submitted electronically (ideally in a sin-
gle pdf).

Summary: This advanced course covers statistical
methods currently used to map disease susceptibility
genes, with an emphasis on (but not limited to) meth-
ods that can analyse family data or a combination
of families and individuals. Discussions of the latest
statistical methodology are complemented by practical
hands-on computer exercises using state-of-the-art soft-
ware. The statistical basics behind each method will
be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand.
We will discuss fundamental issues needed to increase
success in gene mapping studies including: optimal
study design, power to detect linkage and association,
determining the most appropriate statistical methods
and software, interpretation of statistical results and
trouble shooting. We will also cover the basic principles
of statistical inference, hypothesis testing, populationand quantitative genetics and Mendelian inheritance.
Our interactive and intensive educational program will
enable one to better carry out sophisticated statistical
analyses of genetic data, and will also improve one's in-
terpretation and understanding of the results. All the
software used is freely available, so that skills learned
can be easily applied after the course.
Teaching will take the form of lectures by invited speak-
ers, informal tutorials, hands-on computer sessions, and
analysis of disease family data sets. There will also be
an opportunity to discuss participants' own data sets.
Registration fee and bursaries: Registration (including
accommodation and all meals) $890. Limited bursaries
are available covering up to 50% of the registration fee.

*FACILIS 2014 *
This year, the University of Milan will host an in-
ternational short course of the EU-US Taskforce on
Biotechnology Research, working group of Environmen-
tal Biotechnology. The event builds on the success of
the four previous courses in training early-career sci-
entists in state-of-the-art theoretical and practical as-
pects of environmental biotechnology. This year's short
course is entitled \FACILIS 2014, Microbially-driven
facilitation systems in environmental biotechnology".
The two-week long, hands-on experimental programme
includes eld trips and daily lectures in environmental
microbiology and microbial biotechnology. The cen-
tral concept focuses on the identication of microbial
strains that can be harnessed for environmental pur-
poses such as contaminant degradation or for benecial
plant-microbe interactions. Course experiments will in-
clude community analyses by PCR ngerprinting, bar-
coding, pyrosequencing and metagenomics, and tests
on bacterial isolates such as growth on biphenyl, search
for degradation-related genes, plant growth promotion,
strain genetic labelling and /in vivo/ colonisation.
Twenty four young scientists will be invited to partici-
pate { 12 from each side of the Atlantic. Applications
will be accepted from students working in the USA or

As part of the NESCent Academy, we are pleased to
open applications for 'Paleobiological and phylogenetic
approaches to macroevolution'. This course will teach
participants to use fossil and phylogenetic data to an-
alyze macroevolutionary patterns using traditional pa-
leobiological stratigraphic methods, phylogenetic com-
parative methods and combined fossil and tree ap-
proaches. By the end of the course participants will be
able to use online paleobiological databases to down-
load fossil occurrence data and estimate speciation and
extinction rates while controlling for sampling bia; will
understand the basics of building phylogenies of fossil
and extant species and use such phylogenies to esti-
mate speciation and extinction rates; and nally, will
understand how to use models of evolution to calculate
phenotypic disparity using stratigraphic and phyloge-
netic approaches as well as estimate ancestral states
and the tempo and mode of trait evolution. This cross-
disciplinary course is designed to train a new generation
of researchers capable of implementing both fossil and
tree-methods, paving the way towards a new synthetic
approach to study macroevolution.

The elds of phylogenetics and phylogeography are on
the cusp of a revolution, enabled by the rapid expan-
sion of genomic resources and explosion of new genome
sequencing technologies. Researchers are now able to
obtain large phylogenomic data sets for any system
rapidly and economically. In this course, students will
receive an overview of recent technological advances,
learn about data collection using emerging phyloge-
nomic approaches, and analyze data sets using the most
recent methods. This couse will provide tools for many
critical eorts in the eld including assembling the Tree
of Life, delimiting species, and understanding the pro-
cesses driving speciation. The intended audience is
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and fac-
ulty who wish to gain training in this area.

2014 Website: academy.nescent.org Where: National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), Durham,
NC
Phylogenies have become central to virtually all areas
of research in evolutionary biology, ecology, molecu-
lar biology and epidemiology. The development of a
Bayesian statistical framework for phylogeny estima-
tion is one of the most signicant developments in this
area of study over the past decade and has facilitated
the development of models that better capture biolog-
ical complexity. Moreover, by integrating over param-
eter values, Bayesian inference provides a natural way
to accommodate uncertainty in both estimates of phy-
logeny (and other model parameters) and inferences
based on those phylogenies.
Advances in theory have been accompanied by advances
in software implementing new phylogenetic models.
This course is built around the use of the new, open-
source program RevBayes ( http://sourceforge.net/-
projects/revbayes/) and is organized and staed by the
developers. RevBayes has as a central idea that phy-
logenetic models, like any statistical model, are com-
posed of smaller parts that can be decomposed and
put back together in a modular fashion. This comes
from considering phylogenetic models as probabilistic
graphical models, which lends exibility and enhances
the capabilities of the program. RevBayes implements
an R-like language (complete with control statements,
user-dened functions, and loops) that enables the user
to build up phylogenetic models from simple parts (ran-
dom variables, transformations, models, and constants
of dierent sorts).April 1, 2014 EvolDir 121
Fundamentally, this course will begin by covering the
basics of probability theory, graphical models, and phy-
logenetics. Then, building on these concepts, we will
provide lectures on statistical methods for phylogenetic
inference, macroevolution, and epidemiology. Each
component of the course will include hands-on tuto-
rials for conducting analyses in RevBayes. Addition-
ally, open-labs are scheduled for participants interested
in applying these methods to their own data or work-
ing with the developers to create new models in the
RevBayes language.

EvolutionaryQuantGenet Aug4-9
The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological
Synthesis (NIMBioS) is now accepting applications for
its Tutorial, \Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics," to
be held August 4-9, 2014, at NIMBioS.
*Objectives: *Quantitative genetic theory has been ap-
plied to a wide range of phenomena including the evolu-
tion of dierences between the sexes, sexual preferences,
life history traits, plasticity of traits, as well as the evo-
lution of body size and other morphological measure-
ments. This tutorial is for evolutionary biologists inter-
ested in how quantitative genetics theory can be tested
with data. Participants { graduate students, postdocs,
and junior faculty { will learn how to use R to build and
test evolutionary models. There is a need for evolution-
ary biologists to understand the eld of evolutionary
quantitative genetics because of the ability to collect
large amounts of data by computer, the development of
statistical methods for changes of traits on evolutionary
trees and for changes in a single species through time,
and the realization that quantitative characters will not
soon be fully explained by genomics.
*Location: *NIMBioS at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville*Co-Organizers: *Stevan J. Arnold, Integrative Biol-
ogy, Oregon State Univ. and Joe Felsenstein, Genome
Sciences, Univ. of Washington, Seattle
*Co-Sponsors: *National Evolutionary Synthesis Cen-
ter (NESCent) and the American Society of Naturalists

SCENE Scotland Morphometrics
May12-15 DeadlineExtended
Course outline and details;
A geometric morphometric course will be taking place
at the Scottish Center for Ecology and the Natural En-
vironment (SCENE), from the 12th-15th May, 2014.
Details of SCENE can be found using the link be-
low http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/bahcm/-
researchfacilitiesgroups/scene/ Prof. Chris Kligen-
berg will be delivering the course, Chris is a pro-
fessor at Manchester University and designed/wrote
the software morphoJ (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm) and specialises in geometric mor-
phometrics and analysing evolutionary data sets based
on shape change. The software is used a lot in in
plant biology, evolutionary biology, functional morphol-
ogy palaeontology, etc. and can really be applied to
many dierent elds. It allows comparison of shapes,
images, structures in either two or three dimensions.
This type of analysis is well suited to analysing evo-
lutionary and functional morphology data, population
dynamics, anything that can be compared using shape
or physical characteristics.
The course will take participants through the complete
process involved with preparing and analysing shape
data. There will be a background explaining the his-
tory and principles behind geometric morphometrics.
It will cover the basics of data acquisition and the most
productive method to digitise landmarks using software
TPSdig and TPSutil as well as others. Cover in de-
tail how to extract and visualise shape changes from
your images. Identify where variation is in your sam-
ples using Principle Component Analysis, how to ex-
port, for example PC scores to be analysed further in,
for example, R. Compare the amount of variation be-
tween groups using Discriminant Function and Canon-
ical Variance Analysis). How covariation, using regres-
sion, can be used to size correct data i.e. to remove the
eect of allometry or unwanted shape variation. Modu-
larity, Partial Least Squares and mapping shape change
with phylogeny (to compare across species/families)
will also be covered before a nal overview of how these
dierent types of analysis can be used to answer hy-
pothesis.
The course is delivered to participants by workingApril 1, 2014 EvolDir 123
through exercises and examples which specically give
good insight as to how you might answer or formulate
questions about your own data so is both lecture style
and practical.
The course is 4 days long (Monday 12th - Thursday
15th May, 2014, 9:30 - 18:30 (approx. 8 teaching hours).
There are 20-24 spaces on the course (to be conrmed)
which costs ^A$375 (stand alone) or with meals, refresh-
ments and accommodation (arrival Sunday 11th in the
pm and departure Friday 16th in the am) ^A$575 when
booked before April 12th, ^A$450.00 and ^A$650.00 re-
spectively when booked after this date. This reduced
fee deadline has been extended from February 28th due
to a lot of late interest from people.
I have attended this this course so if you have any ques-
tions as to what is covered then please email me or my
telephone number is at the bottom of the email.

Description: The DNA metabarcoding spring school
is now in its fourth edition. DNA metabarcoding is
a rapidly evolving technique for assessing biodiversity
from environmental DNA. Its range of applications is
wide and covers, as examples, biodiversity monitor-
ing, animal diet assessment and paleo-ecology. DNA
metabarcoding relies on up-to-date molecular tech-
niques such as PCR and next generation sequencing,
and requires bioinformatic and biostatistic competen-
cies to be able to analyse the results. This is intrinsi-
cally a technique at the interface of several disciplines
that requires a broad range of skills in addition to the124 EvolDir April 1, 2014
classical ecology knowledge related to the specic re-
search topic. Each participant will have to present a
12 minute talk on their work and the relevance of DNA
metabarcoding to their work to other participants in
order to stimulate discussions with other participants
and with the presenters.
Travel and accommodation: Travel and accommoda-
tion is for the participants' account. The travel between
Port Elizabeth airport and the Samara reserve will be
organized on Sunday 2 November 2014 in the afternoon
(departure from Port Elizabeth at 15.30). Return will
be on Saturday 8 November (arrival in Port Elizabeth
airport at 11.00). The cost of the accommodation (in-
cluding all meals) at Samara is 6000 ZAR, correspond-
ing to about 410 EUR or 560 USD. The transfer from
Port Elizabeth to Samara is estimated to be about 700
ZAR corresponding to about 50 EUR or 65 USD. Pay-
ments must be paid directly to the service providers by
the successful applicants within 2 weeks of notication
of acceptance for the school (more information will be
given to successful applicants after 4 May 2014).
We are looking for funds to partially support accom-
modation costs for participants from Africa, but there
is as yet no such supporting funds available.
Content: The school will comprise of a series of lectures
and practicals introducing dierent aspects of DNA
metabarcoding, with a focus on diet analysis. Partici-
pants will be trained in sample identication and col-
lection in the eld, followed by extraction techniques.

Vienna NGS for
PopGenetExperimentalEvol
*Practical Course on Next Generation Sequencing for
Population Genetics and Experimental Evolution*
1st announcement:
The Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics is
organising a next generation sequencing (NGS) course
from October 19 to 26 at the Vetmeduni Vienna, Aus-
tria.
Recent technological advances in sequencing have
greatly changed the scope of biological questions ad-
dressable in experimental evolution systems. In partic-
ular, in addition to the study of phenotypes it is now
possible to study molecular data genome-wide. Even
population genetic analysis have become within reach
for moderate research budgets by pooling individuals
before sequencing. However, the analysis of massive
amounts of data generated in course of a single experi-
ment, especially time series data, require new statistical
skills to be maximally informative.
Unfortunately, many research groups aiming to use the
new sequencing technologies are facing enormous prac-
tical and conceptual diculties handling the data. The
planned course aims to facilitate the use of new se-
quencing technologies by providing users a hands-on
introduction to available tools and techniques and ex-
plaining the concepts underlying them. The demand
for such training is large and growing and this course
is in particular aimed for evolutionary groups that usu-
ally do not have access to in house training for next
generation sequencing.
Teaching Faculty (Names in bold indicate the organiz-
ers of the course): Eszter Ari, E otv os Lor and Uni-
versity, Hungary Andrea Betancourt, Vetmeduni Vi-

WestVirginia WildlifeParasites
Jul28-31
Third Annual International Workshop on Malaria and
Related Haemosporidian Parasites of Wildlife
Monday July 28th - Thursday July 31st, 2014 National
Conservation Training Center, Shepherdstown, West
Virginia130 EvolDir April 1, 2014
Sponsored by the NSF Research Coordination Network
for Haemosporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates1
Dear Colleagues,
The NSF-sponsored Research Coordination Network
for Haemosporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (Malari-
aRCN) is pleased to announce our third annual work-
shop on the malaria parasites and closely related
haemosporidians of natural populations of vertebrates.
The four day workshop will include both eld and lab-
oratory exercises as well as lectures and discussions led
by RCN members2.
Topics to be covered throughout the workshop include
vertebrate and invertebrate eld capture techniques,
blood sampling and preparation of blood smears, sam-
ple vouchering and preservation, parasite taxonomy,
light microscopy for parasite identication and parasite
and cell counts, sequence data analysis, and databas-
ing. Discussion topics will include, but are not limited
to, the basic biology, phylogenetics and systematics of
Haemosporida, community ecology of parasites, coevo-
lution and the evolution of virulence, and conservation
and disease.
All food, lodging and workshop events will take place
at the US Fish & Wildlife Service's National Conser-
vation Training Center in Shepherdstown, West Vir-
ginia, a site easily accessible through Washington, D.C.
area airports. The workshop will commence on Mon-
day morning, July 28th, and continue through until the
evening of Thursday, July 31st.
The workshop is geared towards graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, and other investigators new to
the eld of wildlife haemosporidians. We will be accept-
ing applications in early 2014 and encourage individu-
als from outside the United States, particularly from
developing countries. Applications will be available in
early February 2014 through the RCN website. Work-
shop cost, accommodations, meals, and transportation
from the Washington Dulles International Airport will
be covered by the RCN grant for workshop partici-
pants. In addition, applications for travel funds will
be considered. Additional information on the work-
shop including an overview of the four days of events
will be made available on the RCN website (we encour-
age you to register on the RCN website and become
a member of the Malaria Research Coordination Net-
work). In the meantime, further information can be
obtained from the workshop organizers (email: Malari-
aRCNWorkshop@gmail.com). Applications should also
be sent to this e-mail address. Applications will be con-
sidered until April 15th and decisions on participation
made in early May 2014.1 The Research Coordination Network for Haemo-
sporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (\Malaria RCN"),
sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation
and funded through 2015 at the University of Missouri-
St. Louis, was established to promote communication
among researchers working on the ecology and evolu-
tion of haemosporidian parasites of vertebrate wildlife
populations. Please visit the website for the network
(www.malariarcn.org) for more information.
2 Workshop organizers and instructors include Robert
Ricklefs (University of Missouri - St. Louis), Staan
Bensch (Lund University), Gediminas Valkiunas (Na-
ture Research Center, Vilnius), Carter Atkinson
(USGS), Susan Perkins (American Museum of Natu-
ral History), Robert Fleischer (Smithsonian Conserva-
tion Biology Institute), and Ellen Martinsen (Smithso-
nian Conservation Biology Institute). Other members
of this RCN include Patricia Parker (University of Mis-
souri - St. Louis), Ravinder Sehgal (San Francisco State
University), Tom Smith (University of California, Los
Angeles), and Robert Adlard (Queensland Museum).
**The workshop is likely to be of interest to evolution-
ary biologists as it will center around the systematics
of a very successful and diverse group of parasites of
natural vertebrate populations and include laboratory
exercises involving phylogenetic analysis of parasite lin-
eages and readings and discussions on the evolutionary
history of the parasites including cospeciation of hosts
and parasites as well as the evolution of virulence.

Summary: This advanced course covers statistical
methods currently used to map disease susceptibility
genes, with an emphasis on (but not limited to) meth-
ods that can analyse family data or a combination
of families and individuals. Discussions of the latest
statistical methodology are complemented by practical
hands-on computer exercises using state-of-the-art soft-
ware. The statistical basics behind each method will
be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand.
We will discuss fundamental issues needed to increase
success in gene mapping studies including: optimal
study design, power to detect linkage and association,
determining the most appropriate statistical methods
and software, interpretation of statistical results and
trouble shooting. We will also cover the basic principles
of statistical inference, hypothesis testing, population
and quantitative genetics and Mendelian inheritance.
Our interactive and intensive educational program will
enable one to better carry out sophisticated statistical
analyses of genetic data, and will also improve one's in-
terpretation and understanding of the results. All the
software used is freely available, so that skills learned
can be easily applied after the course.
Teaching will take the form of lectures by invited speak-
ers, informal tutorials, hands-on computer sessions, and
analysis of disease family data sets. There will also be
an opportunity to discuss participants' own data sets.
Registration fee and bursaries: Registration (including
accommodation and all meals) $890. Limited bursaries
are available covering up to 50% of the registration fee.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
