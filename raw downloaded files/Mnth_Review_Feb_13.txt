in Zurich, Switzerland in 1995.
EMPSEB 19 will last for 5 days and will involve a va-
riety of activities, discussions and excursions. Joining
the participants will be a number of senior evolutionary
scientists who have been invited to give plenary talks,
run discussion groups, and provide expert guidance on
starting a scientic career. Plenary speakers will pro-
vide constructive feedback on talks by PhD students,
who are all required to give a short 10 minute presen-
tation.
We would be very grateful if you could forward this
message to anyone you think might be interested.

Summary: Quantitative approaches to evolutionary ge-
nomics, systems biology, and ecology unravel several
universal regularities connecting genome-scale observ-
ables, phenotypes and physiological traits. A current
challenge for theoreticians is understanding how dif-
ferent universal features emerging empirically can be
accounted for by simple mathematical models explor-
ing quantitative laws at dierent levels, from physiol-
ogy to evolutionary genomics. The scope of this work-
shop is to give an overview of the current state of this
emerging eld. The workshop will primarily target PhD
students and postdocs with a physics or mathematics
background, but the school is open to anyone with back-
ground in (evolutionary) genomics, (evolutionary) biol-
ogy, bioinformatics, ecology, interested in quantitative
work.

Deception
Dear Colleagues,
If you have not already heard, registration is now open
for the XIV Congress of the European Society for Evo-
lutionary Biology (https://www.eseb2013.com), hap-
pening in Lisbon, Portugal, from the 19th - 24th August
2013. We are pleased to invite abstract submissions for
oral and poster presentations until the 28th of February
2013, for the symposium entitled:
EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF DECEP-
TION
Invited speakers:
- Martin Stevens (University of Cambridge)
- Tom Sherratt (Carleton University)
Organisers:
- Carita Lindstedt-Kareksela (University of Jyv askyl a)
- Mikael Mokkonen (University of Jyv askyl a and Simon
Fraser University)
Description: The ability to deceive oneself, conspecics
or individuals of other species is a fundamental as-
pect to many coevolutionary struggles. Brood parasites
have the ability to produce eggs that exactly resemble
the egg coloration of their host species, while alterna-February 1, 2013 EvolDir 5
tive mating strategies employed by ^ asneaker' individ-
uals circumvent confrontation in intrasexual competi-
tion - these are just a few examples of widely known
deceptive strategies in the animal kingdom. Deception
allows individuals to gain an evolutionary advantage in
reproduction and/or survival, such as through decep-
tive colour mimicry, predator-prey systems, sexually
antagonistic encounters with a mate, parent-ospring
interactions or competition over resources. Much of the
existing research on deception has been fragmented into
various topics with limited interaction, even though
there are some common themes such as frequency de-
pendent selection, manipulation of the receiver's sen-
sory system, and the antagonistic coupling of the actor's
benets to costs of the recipient(s). Thus, our goals
of this symposium are to unify researchers from dier-
ent elds, as well as provide opportunities to present
novel ndings, questions, and dierent perspectives in
an eort to better understand the costs and benets of
deception.

the website at https://www.eseb2013.com We look for-

Prof. Simone Sommer http://www.izw-berlin.de/-
welcome.html Description: Conservation biology is
one of the rare elds of biology where evolution has
too often been neglected. The reason for this probably
stems from the misconception that evolution does not
act on an ecologically relevant time scale. Here, we
aim to combine evolutionary and conservation biology.
The symposium spans a large range of elds and will be
organized in three parts (1) Evolutionary theories (e.g.
viability of small populations, pace of allele xation,
role of phenotypic plasticity etc) (2) Evolutionary con-
straints on small population sizes and impacts of con-
servation measures. (3) Next generation sequencing:
genetic diversity, evolution and adaptative potential of
endangered species.
The symposium will lead to a special issue in Evo-6 EvolDir February 1, 2013

GenomeEvolution
Dear colleague,
We would like to invite submission of abstracts to the
symposium \Linking genome evolution at dierent time
scales" to take place at the meeting of the European
Society for Evolutionary Biology in Lisbon (23rd-26th
June, 2012; https://www.eseb2013.com/symposia).
The deadline to submit an abstract is the 28th of Febru-
ary 2013, for more details please visit:
https://www.eseb2013.com/talks Symposium sum-
mary:
The inferrence of evolutionary forces, notably selection,
from molecular data, has a long tradition in evolution-
ary biology. Studies usually focus either on interspeci
c or on intraspeci
c data, and thus address disconnected questions.
Thanks to advances in genomics and in computational
biology, there is increasing interest in bridging the
gap between these two fundamental scales of evolution.
This symposium will provide exciting discussions and
prospects to where next-generation sequencing data can
lead us in the understanding of the selective forces act-
ing during evolution.

benkian de Ci^ encia, Lisbon), Laurent Excoer (Uni-

of phenotypic diversity. The aim of this symposium is
to highlight novel results and synthesize our knowledge
on the contribution of non-genetic inheritance to evolu-

extended theory of evolution where genes are not the
only inheritance system.

Montpellier Speciation2013
May27-29
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that the second Euro-
pean Conference on Speciation Research (SPECIA-
TION 2013) will be held in Montpellier, France, 27-29
May 2013.
This conference is part of the European Science
Foundation1s Research Networking Programme Fron-
tiers of Speciation Research (FroSpects), which is
funded by 18 of ESF1s national member organisations.
This event will echo the rst European conference ded-
icated to speciation research that took place at the
IIASA Conference Center, Laxenburg, Austria in 2010.
As a closure event of the FroSpects network on speci-
ation research, this second conference aims to provide
an update on the contemporary status of the eld and
future research prospects.
A major focus of the conference will be to facilitate
bridge- building between the dierent approaches to
speciation research and to promote connections among
researchers in this eld of research. To this aim, the
conference will promote lectures surveying elds of con-
temporary speciation research and encourage contri-
butions of an integrative as well as innovative nature.
The presentations and discussions will cover topics in-
cluding, but not limited to, speciation-with-gene-ow,
macro-evolutionary patterns of diversication, speciescohesion and recognition, speciation models, the role of
hybridisation and adaptive introgression in speciation,
adaptive and ecological speciation, non-ecological speci-
ation, genetics and genomics of speciation, behavioural
drivers of speciation, experimental evolution, plasticity
and learning, the interplay between sexual and natural
selection.
The conference will be held in the historical School
of Medicine in Montpellier, one of the oldest medical
schools in Europe. It will feature 16 invited speakers
(see the list below), as many contributed talks and some
poster presentations.
Further details about the conference organisation, reg-
istration and application procedures, accommodation
in Montpellier and travel directions will be posted in
the coming weeks.

The last few decades have witnessed the burgeoning
of many highly productive lines of investigation into
abiogenesis and the early emergence of biological com-
plexity. Planetary sciences and geochemistry have pro-
duced a short-list of well-studied settings where pre-
biotic chemistry may have led to the transition from
non-living to living matter. Major advances in abiotic
syntheses of important biomolecules have resulted in
an improved understanding of the relative availabilities
of proto-biomolecules. The continuing growth of bioin-
formatics databases has given computational biologists
an unprecedented ability to reconstruct the properties
of early organisms and ancient evolutionary histories.
Synthetic biology now allows investigators to examine
the boundaries of life's genetic systems and minimal life
in the laboratory. In general, the advance of astrobi-
ology has expanded our understanding of habitability
and life as cosmological phenomena. This workshop will
integrate these themes, foster new local, national and
international collaborations, and actively encourage sci-
entists from within and outside the Princeton commu-
nity to pursue studies of life's origins. The workshop
program will bring together researchers in these dis-
parate subjects and subelds to address the questions
of life's origins in the astronomical, chemical, genetic,
evolutionary, and information-theoretic contexts.

*Jacques Monod Conference: **\Ecological and evolu-

(Brittany), France, November 2-6, 2013*
The conference is co-organized by Michael Hochberg
(Montpellier, France) and Paul Ewald (Louisville,
USA). Jacques Monod Conference website: http://-
www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/cjmprog e.html Cancer is a dis-
ease of opportunity, associated with clonal evolution,
expansion and competition within the body. Speci-
cally, somatic cellular selection and evolution are the
fundamental processes leading to malignancy, metas-
tasis and resistance to therapies. The Jacques Monod
Conference \*Ecological and Evolutionary Perspectives
in Cancer" *aims to promote this emerging discipline by
addressing some of the most important questions about
cancerogenesis. The conference will cover 3 themes:
- Interspecic patterns and processes - Progression -
Therapies
The rst theme will address the observation that in-
fectious agents can cause cancers. Persistent infections
may promote cancer because long-term host defensive
responses induce inammation that subsequently in-
creases mutation rates. Why human defensive mech-
anisms have not evolved to more eciently control
or eliminate invasive cell lineages, and why do some
species with more somatic tissue show less than ex-
pected incidences of cancer? The second theme will
evaluate the role of the tumor environment and natu-
ral selection in explaining cancer progression. To what
extent are dierent cancers predictable and what areFebruary 1, 2013 EvolDir 13
the key contributing variables? The third theme will
tackle the daunting challenge of employing evolution-
ary theories to improve cancer therapies. It will seek
how preventative, curative and management therapies
can be improved and even optimized to slow or stop the
emergence of resistance to chemotherapies.

Cenference website: http://www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/-
cjmprog e.html The last decade has seen important
progress in our understanding of the causes and conse-
quences of the evolution of genetic systems (the struc-
ture of the genetic material and its modes of transmis-
sion) both on theoretical and empirical grounds. This
progress partly derives from the development of new
methods and technologies such as genomics and bioin-
formatics, new statistical methods to explore macroevo-
lutionary patterns, new biological systems for experi-
mental evolution, or studies of the molecular basis of
shifts in reproductive systems. At the same time, the-
oretical and population studies have continued to pro-
vide important insights. The goal of this conference is
to bring together researchers using these dierent ap-
proaches to study various aspects of genetic systems,
including the evolution of sex and recombination, in-
breeding vs. outcrossing and the evolution of sexual
dimorphism, in order to pinpoint important parame-
ters that need to be measured and determine how new
forms of data can be used to make progress on impor-
tant, yet unsolved evolutionary questions.
The conference will be organized in six sessions:
Advantage of sex and recombination: recent develop-
ments on the evolutionary benets of genetic mixing.
Biology of sexual and asexual reproduction: phyloge-
netic distribution of sexual and asexual lineages; prox-
imate mechanisms inducing shifts in reproductive sys-
tems. Evolution of inbreeding vs. outcrossing: theoret-
ical and empirical work on the evolution of mating sys-
tems. Evolution of sexual dierentiation: the evolution
of separate sexes and sexual dimorphism. Evolution
of sex chromosomes: genetic determination of sex in
plants, animals and fungi Open session: other aspects
of genetic system evolution

The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine
Research (AWI), division of \Biosciences", section
\Coastal Ecology" at the Wadden Sea Station Sylt
(Mathias Wegner) in cooperation with the departmentof Marine Ecology & Evolution at the NIOZ, Texel
(David Thieltges) is seeking to appoint a
PhD candidate (f/m)
within the DFG priority program SPP 1399 \Host Par-
asite Coevolution".
Description: The project \Co-evolution of invasive par-
asites with old and new host species along a gradient
of ancient to recent sympatry" within the DFG prior-
ity program SPP1399 \Host Parasite co-evolution" will16 EvolDir February 1, 2013
use biological invasions of parasites as a background
to understand co-evolutionary patterns. The invasion
of two parasitic copepods of the genus Mytilicola (M.
intestinalis and M. orientalis) into the North Sea via
aquaculture activities represents a unique system where
two closely related congeners evolved with new and old
hosts along a gradient of ancient to recent sympatry.
By following a transcriptomic approach of hosts (oys-
ters and mussels) and parasites from native and invaded
ranges in a cross experimental infection scheme, this
system can be used to identify physiological responses
on the transcriptional level as well as evolutionary re-
sponses selecting for certain genetic variants favoured
during the invasion process. Practical work will include
eld trips to collaborators in the Netherlands, Portugal
and Japan, eld & laboratory infection experiments on
Sylt, as well as molecular analysis of native and invasive
populations.
The successful candidate will be based at the AWI
Wadden Sea station in List/Sylt and can join the
Helmholtz graduate school for Polar and Marine Re-
search 'POLMAR' (www.polmar.awi.de). The Wad-
den Sea Station oers excellent experimental facilities
and direct access to eld sites in the national park
\Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer", which was re-
cently awarded the status of a world heritage site. AWI
housing (shared at) is available at reasonable rates.
Requirements: Diploma/MSc degree in biology with
fundamental understanding of ecological and evolution-
ary principles. Prior knowledge of experimental design,
statistical analysis of large data sets, bioinformatics and
some molecular and wet lab skills are a denite plus.
The position is funded for 3 years with a salary in accor-
dance with the German TV oD payscale: salary group
13 (50% minimum). The starting date for the position
is negotiable but needs to be lled as soon as possible.

PhD OPPORTUNITY, Lancaster University
The Impact of Environmental Quality on Song in Male
and Female Dippers (Cinclus cinclus)
Supervisor: Dr Stuart Sharp, Lancaster Environment
Centre Start date: October 2013
Why is this project important? Bird song is among the
most intensively studied forms of animal behaviour, but
the diverse ways in which environmental change may
impact on song and the consequences for avian ecology
are only just starting to be appreciated. Singing is ener-
getically costly, and song development is strongly inu-
enced by the quality of environmental conditions expe-
rienced in early life (the nutritional stress hypothesis).
Song structure and output are therefore indicators of
male quality and, in some species, provide females with
information about the level of paternal investment thatthe singer is likely to make. Thus, living in habitats
where food is scarce or contaminants have entered the
food chain may aect male reproductive strategies and
tness via an impact on song structure and singing be-
haviour. These ideas have received surprisingly little
attention, despite growing interest in the inuence of
environmental change on bird song. Furthermore, the
eects of nutritional stress or environmental change on
the song of females have never been studied, and fe-
male song in general is poorly understood. This project
aims to address these gaps in our understanding of the
relationship between environmental quality, song and
tness in both males and females.
The focus of the project The dipper is a bird of fast-
owing rivers and streams and a well-known indicator
of the quality of riverine habitat, being highly sensitive
to water pH and the accumulation of contaminants in
invertebrate prey. Both male and female dippers sing
throughout the year, and investment in ospring care
is highly variable within and between individuals. This
project will focus on a long-term study population of
dippers in Yorkshire Dales National Park, combining
eld observations and experiments with acoustic anal-
yses to investigate how variation in water quality im-
pacts on song structure and singing behaviour in males
and females, and to explore the relationship between
song variation, parental investment and reproductive
success.
What is in it for you? Gain invaluable eldwork ex-
perience working with wild animals in one of the UKs
most beautiful and diverse environments. Become an
expert in sound recording and acoustic analysis (full
training will be provided). Develop links with external
organisations, including Yorkshire Dales National Park,
the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the British
Trust for Ornithology. Join an exciting research team
working at the interface between animal ecology and en-
vironmental change in the large and vibrant Lancaster
Environment Centre.
Who should apply? The ideal candidate will have a
strong background in zoology (a rst or upper sec-
ond class degree or a Masters in an appropriate sub-
ject) and an enthusiasm for animal behaviour. A
full driving license and previous eldwork experience
(preferably with wild birds) are essential, and ap-
plicants must be willing to work independently in a
sometimes challenging environment. Some experience
with sound recording/acoustic analysis and bird ring-
ing would be advantageous. For further information or
informal enquiries about the project, email Dr Sharp
(s.sharp2@lancaster.ac.uk).

Urban ecology: The impact of trac-related pollution
for genetic and non-genetic adaptation of detoxifying
systems in wild birds
PhD studentship (4 years), Lund, Sweden Lund Uni-
versity/ Biological institution Supervisor: Dr Caroline
Isaksson, Co-supervisor: Prof. Staan Bensch
It is well known that humans living in areas with high
levels of trac-related pollution show increased inci-
dence of oxidative stress related diseases such as can-
cers, pulmonary and cardio-vascular diseases. Previ-
ously it has been shown that birds living in polluted
areas have elevated antioxidant responses, which may
result from an increased oxidative stress. However,
the underlying mechanisms that mediate this response
and the consequences thereof at the individual- and
population-level remain unknown. To investigate the
fundamental mechanisms behind oxidative stress the
present project will use an interdisciplinary research
approach that combines physiology, molecular biology,
toxicology, and evolutionary ecology using replicated
urban/rural pairs of wild bird populations.
The studentship will be under the umbrella of the above
project description but depending on the applicant's in-
terest and previous experiences, we will together tailora PhD plan within this framework. Thus, we seek a
highly motivated and bright student with strong inter-
est in evolutionary ecology. Previous experience with
avian eld work (ringing and blood sampling), molecu-
lar and/or physiological lab work is advantageous.
The eldwork will mainly be based in southern Swe-
den (Scania), however, trips across Sweden and Europe
is also planned. Field work will occur throughout the
year, thus you need to be prepared for lots of physically
demanding outdoor activities in good and bad weather.
A driving license at the start of the position is essential
as it will be required for the eldwork starting in April
2013.
The student will be based at the Department of Biology
Lund University (http://www.biologi.lu.se/). The de-
partment oers a stimulating international environment
with weekly journal clubs, lab meetings and seminars
with invited international and national speakers. The
lab oers state-of-the-art equipment for molecular work
and Lund University oers excellent infrastructure with
regards to electronic journals, internet support, student
support, and PhD courses. The working language is
English.
This studentship is funded 50% by the Swedish research
council (Vetenskapsr adet, VR) to Dr C Isaksson and
50% by the unit Evolutionary Ecology. Full funding is
available for the project, but the student is encouraged

name of two referees, and a concise cover letter of your
research interests to: Caroline.Isaksson@biol.lu.se. For
further information concerning the studentship, please

PhD position at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology, Department of Evolutionary Ecology,
Ploen (Germany) within the DFG priority program
SPP 1399 \Host Parasite Coevolution" (see http://-ieb.uni-muenster.de/spp/).
We invite highly motivated students with a background
in Evolutionary Biology/Parasitology to apply for a
PhD position at the MPI for Evolutionary Biology. The
applicant should have a Diplom/Master in Biology (or
its equivalent). Ideally the candidate should have ex-
perience in molecular genetics, statistical analysis and
bioinformatics, as well as a strong interest in host par-
asite coevolution.
The ability to successfully work in a team is expected,
as the candidate will collaborate with a team working
on immunogenetics, immunology, population genetics,
parasitology, and behavioural ecology, both in the lab
and in the eld. More information about the depart-
ment's research interests can be found under: http:/-
/www.evolbio.mpg.de/15664/evolutionaryecology De-
scription of the project: The project deals with the
molecular basis of host-parasite interactions between
the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
and its highly specic tapeworm parasite Schisto-
cephalus solidus. We have found remarkable dierences
in virulence between populations of the parasite, par-
ticularly in laboratory cross-infections where allopatric
host-parasite combinations exhibit very dierent infec-
tion phenotypes. This experimental system provides
excellent possibilities to investigate the molecular basis
of host-parasite interactions and how parasite virulence
is regulated. A comparative transcriptomic approach
revealed dierences in expression of genes involved in
immune evasion strategies of the parasite. However,
under natural conditions individual tapeworms usually
share their hosts with several other parasites, leading
to intra- and inter-specic competition within a host
individual.
The successful candidate will work on the molecu-
lar mechanisms of such parasite-parasite interactions
and its consequences on the host's immune functions.
He/she will design and perform laboratory infection
experiments, conduct transcriptomic studies on both
hosts and parasites, and carry out bioinformatic anal-
ysis of the obtained data. Since the ultimate goal of
the project is to understand the ecological factors de-
termining the evolution of parasite virulence in nature,
there will also be eld studies in Germany and Nor-
way. The project is part of a close collaboration with
Dr. J orn Scharsack (University of M unster, sh im-
munology) and Prof. Thorsten Reusch/David Haase
(GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in
Kiel, bioinformatic support). Furthermore, the candi-
date can enroll in the 'International Max Planck Re-
search School for Evolutionary Biology' (see http://-
imprs.evolbio.mpg.de/).22 EvolDir February 1, 2013

MaxPlanck Tuebingen Sticklebacks
Graduate positions are available in the new lab of Dr
Felicity Jones at the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of
Max Planck Society, Tuebingen, Germany.
Threespine stickleback sh have recently emerged to
be an excellent evolutionary model organism (Jones et
al Nature; Chan et al 2010 Science). In the Jones
Lab we are launching a comprehensive research pro-
gram to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms
underlying adaptive divergence and speciation. We
have previously identied at kilobase resolution a set
of loci underlying repeated divergence between ma-
rine and freshwater stickleback species-pairs (Jones et
al 2012 Nature). These loci are predominantly non-
coding and fall within regions of low recombination
rate (including inversions), suggesting both regulatory
changes and the recombination landscape are impor-
tant in adaptive evolution and speciation. Using trans-
genics gain-of-function assays via Tol2 transposon, and
loss-of-function via zinc-nger nuclease/TALEN we aim
to functionally dissect speciation loci to determine howregulatory evolution aects phenotype, tness and con-
tributes to adaptive divergence. We will also investigate
molecular mechanisms that shape recombination land-
scape and hotspots across the genome and how this
contributes to the maintenance of adaptive suites of
loci (\supergenes") in contact zones between divergent
species. We will continue to expand our rich dataset of
whole genome sequencing, expression analysis and ge-
netic mapping to identify the molecular basis of repro-
ductive isolation between replicate stickleback species-
pairs.
We seek highly motivated PhD applicants with experi-
ence in molecular genetics, transgenics, developmental,
quantitative, computational biology and/or population
genomics.
The FML is located on the Max Planck Campus in Tue-
bingen and oers an international environment, with
English as the working language. We are part of a
dynamic and interactive group of labs researching var-
ious aspects of adaptation and evolutionary genetics,
with the aim of linking molecular changes to organismal
phenotypes. These include the Chan Lab (genetics of
adaptation in mice), Jekely Lab (neurobiology and be-

can be modied by the presence of neighboring organ-
isms. Such neighborhood eects are known from many
systems and are common in plant-insect systems, where
plant neighbors may aect the strength of interactions
between the plant and insect herbivores or between her-
bivores and their natural enemies. The aim here is
to develop and test theory on consumer responses to
mixed resource patches; where non-hosts or alternative
hosts may aect the probability of attack on a specic
resource. The basis for the studies is theory that trans-
lates information about the physiological and behav-
ioral processes involved in host search to probabilities
of nding and consuming hosts in mixed patches. The
thesis work will involve studies of insects that use olfac-
tory cues for host nding, including both behavioural
and physiological studies. The work may also involve
model studies on insect search.

TrentU ContemporaryEvolGenomics
PhD or Postdoctoral Fellow Opportunity: Genomic re-
search on contemporary evolution in natural popula-
tions in response to rapid changes in selective pres-
sures. Infectious diseases are critically important in
species adaptation, evolution, and persistence. How-
ever, climatic changes are altering disease dynamics in
northern species by promoting the invasion of novel dis-
eases and disease vectors. The capacity of northern
species to adapt to these rapid changes is largely un-clear, thereby threatening their persistence. One ap-
proach for understanding adaptation to disease is to
examine the correlation between the geographic distri-
bution of host immunogenetic variation and of disease
variants relative to demographic parameters such as
gene ow that also inuence the distribution of adaptive
and non-adaptive genetic variation. I am seeking a stu-

approach to investigate contemporary evolution and de-
mographic constraints on local adaptation among coe-
volved and na ve disease vectors. These questions are of
practical relevance given pronounced climatic changes

Dazzled and Disrupted: Iridescence as defence
Iridescence (a form of structural colour where the hue
changes according to the angle of viewing) is extremely
widespread, both in mechanisms of production and oc-
currence, in plant and animal kingdoms, however its
adaptive advantage and the selective pressures lead-

EndangeredSpeciesGenetics
Endangered species genetics
We are seeking expressions of interest from individuals
who wish to apply for a fully funded PhD studentship
investigating the application of molecular tools to the
management of breeding programmes for endangered
species. The research will focus on African wild dogs
and pygmy hippos but there is considerable scope for
wider applications.
Applicants will be considered for nomination as a
candidate for an International Postgraduate Research
Scholarship (IPRS) tenable at the University of West-
ern Australia: http://www.scholarships.uwa.edu.au/-
future-students/postgrad/international .If successful in
their application for a scholarship, the PhD candidate
will be co-supervised jointly by the University of West-
ern Australia (Dr Monique Paris) and the University of
Chester (UK) (Dr Paul O'Donoghue), with the student
spending time at both institutions.
Given the precarious status of many in-situ large mam-
mal populations, the need to establish long-term, viable
breeding programmes in zoos, will become increasingly
important. The goal of these breeding programmes is to
maintain genetic diversity and reduce inbreeding over
multiple generations. To help achieve this, studbooks
are in place that provide breeding recommendations to
ensure unrelated animals are paired together. How-
ever, to do this eectively, the genetic relatedness of
the founders needs to be known. In reality this data
is not available and so the default position is that all
founders are assumed to be unrelated.
This PhD project will assess the founder relatedness inthe African wild dog and the pygmy hippo studbooks
to test the validity of the assumption of zero related-
ness amongst founders. The genetic relatedness of the
contemporary population will also be established and,
importantly, genetically under-represented individuals
will be identied for gene banking. This is an exciting
opportunity to make a signicant impact on conserva-
tion of endangered species.
Successful candidates should have a strong background
in genetics, or evolutionary biology. Experience with
a wide range of molecular techniques is essential and a
strong interest in conservation is desirable. It also a key
requirement that the candidate has at last one scientic
publication to ensure competitiveness for a scholarship.
Interested candidates should contact Dr Monique
Paris (mparis@ibream.org) or Dr Paul O'Donoghue
(p.odonoghue@chester.ac.uk) for further information.
Expressions of interest are invited until 20th January

in homeotherms: adaptations that allow testicular
cooling of 2 to 8oC below core body temperature in
mammals, for example, are essential to allow normal
male fertility, and experiments where gonadal or am-
bient temperatures were elevated revealed subsequent
declines in male fertility (review in Setchell 1998).
This thermosensitivity of male fertility is now increas-
ingly recognised in cold-blooded poikilotherms, whose
physiology is more directly aected by environmental
thermal change. In Drosophila fruities, for example,28 EvolDir February 1, 2013
it is the specic thermal sensitivity of male fertility
that makes populations non-viable above 30oC as this is
the threshold where males (not females) become ster-
ile (David et al. 2005). Because of climate warming
and increases in heatwave frequencies, we need to know
what reproductive traits in males are damaged by heat,
whether they can acclimate or harden' and recover, if
local adaptation has evolved, and ultimately the con-
sequences for population viability. This PhD project
will address these questions in a group where good evi-
dence for local extinction under climate warming exists:
butteries.
Using laboratory culturing and experimentation with
temperate zone satyrid buttery species, sourced from
warmer and cooler natural regimes, the PhD will deter-
mine (1) the specic eects of heat stress on male re-
productive function at dierent life stages under dier-
ent thermal regimes, (2) whether temperature-adapted
sub-populations within species exist, and (3) the extent
and rate of acclimation and recovery of male fertility.
We will measure form, function and number of eupyrene
and apyrene sperm after thermal treatments at dierent
life stages, in parallel with male behaviour, fertility and
sperm competitiveness following experimental matings.
Male reproductive eects will be measured in parallel
with female eects (which for most species so far exam-
ined show much reduced sensitivity to equivalent heat
stress). Once controlled experiments have isolated the
details of hyperthermia on male reproductive function
in the lab, we will take this information to the eld,
and measure natural fertility across spatial and tem-
poral thermal ranges within species. At the project
conclusion, we aim to have identied in an important
taxon: which fertility phenotypes are damaged by heat
stress, how they are damaged, the developmental plas-
ticity and ability of these phenotypes to recover, and
ultimately whether this specically sensitive individual
male trait could explain why some buttery populations
have disappeared from their southern ranges.
The student will join an active, NERC-funded re-
search environment, in which the supervisors fo-
cus on studying the evolution and ecology of ani-
mal reproduction in the lab and eld (e.g. Wedell
et al. 2002, Thomas et al. 2006, Michalczyk

interests at www.uea.ac.uk/bio/People/Academic/-

sciences/people/facsta/francoa). Techniques applied
will include buttery rearing, mating and behaviour
assays (in UEA's new Constant Environment Facil-
ity), microdissection, microscopy and image analysis
(in UEA's excellent Bio-imaging suite), experimental
design, eldwork, project management and statisticalanalysis, as well as all the core skills demanded by an

UEastAnglia FruitiesLifeHistory
A 3.5 year PhD project is available at the Univer-
sity of East Anglia, Norwich, UK investigating \Evo-
lutionary mismatches between life histories and envi-
ronments". The successful applicant will be based
in the research group of Prof. Tracey Chapman
(tracey.chapman@uea.ac.uk)
Applications must be received in full by 28th February
2013. Further details and information on how to

postgraduate/research-degrees/science/biological-
sciences . Project Description When environments
vary over time and space individuals can be mis-
matched' - in an environment to which they are not
adapted. In the short term, individuals may show
plastic responses, which can buer deleterious eects.
Given sucient evolutionary time and selection, or-
ganisms will also adapt genetically. This project aims
to explore these ideas in a novel conceptual framework
developed from hominin evolution.
Modern human life histories were selected in a very dif-
ferent environment to that now experienced in indus-
trialised countries. This very recent mismatch' may ex-
plain the rapid and continuing rise in obesity and type
2 diabetes. The thrifty genotype' hypothesis proposes
that individuals selected in an environment of periodic
food shortage will be ecient storing fat when food is
plentiful. However, in environments in which food isFebruary 1, 2013 EvolDir 29
in continual excess, such a genotype is maladaptive. A
second variation on this idea is plasticity to the pre-
vailing environment (thrifty phenotype'). Here, dur-
ing development, the likely quality of the environment
into which the individual will emerge is assessed'. Thus
traits such as insulin sensitivity are plastic and can be
set' during development. However, if the environment
changes rapidly, the organism is set for the wrong en-
vironment, with deleterious consequences.
These ideas have untapped potential and broad rele-
vance for the ecological domain. The aim is to exploit
this by investigating untested predictions of the thrifty
phenotype and genotype hypotheses, using ecologically
relevant manipulations of diet in the fruity model sys-
tem. The main aims are:
1. To measure genetic variation in thrifty genotype'
This hypothesis proposes that increased eciency of
fat storage is advantageous when food supply is vari-
able / scarce. The PI's lab created 3-fold replicated
experimental evolution lines over 10 years years ago in
which food supply is either regular' or random'. The
random lines experience periods of starvation and glut
and should therefore be selected for high eciency fat
storage. Total lipid storage and circulating sugars levels
will be quantied. The full life history (lifespan, repro-
ductive output) of the random and regular regimes will
also be characterised.
2. To measure genetic variation in the expression of
thrifty phenotype'
In additional experimental evolution lines we have repli-
cated regimes that experience good quality food dur-
ing development, but emerge onto either a high or low
quality adult diet. Hence low adult diet individuals are
mismatched' over evolutionary time. We will conduct
the tests above to determine the signicance of these
mismatches.
3. To measure the extent of plasticity in matching' of
genotype to phenotype
The student will create proximate mismatches between
developmental and adult environments by placing co-
horts of wild type individuals on dierent larval and
adult diets. This will show the extent of plasticity to
mismatched environments. The full range of tests will
be conducted as above.
Training: The student will enter UEA's personal and
professional development programme. Through this
they will gain personally tailored training in generic
skills, career development and employability. Specic
skills include analysing responses to experimental evo-
lution, life history assays, biochemical tests of nutrientlevels and quantitative analyses.

UEastAnglia NeotropicalCatsh
PhD position: Polyploidy and immunity in Neotropical
catshes.
A three year PhD project is available at the University
of East Anglia, Norwich, UK investigating the role of
polyploidy in immunity in Neotropical catshes. The
successful applicant will be based in the research group
of Dr Martin Taylor (www.uea.ac.uk/~b141).
Project Description. Ancient whole genome duplica-
tions (WGDs) and the additional genetic resources re-
sulting from them have played major roles in the evo-
lution many eukaryotes. In vertebrates, there is strong
evidence that two rounds of ancient WGD were followed
by a third additional WGD in the teleost shes - the
sh specic genome duplication (FSGD). The role that
WGD plays in the evolutionary success of recipient taxa
and lineages has been hotly debated for many decades.
However, while progress has been made in understand-
ing the origins and mechanisms of the formation of
polyploids in many groups, less attention has been de-
voted to the advantages and/or disadvantages of being
a polyploid. This PhD project will investigate two re-
lated facets of individual tness - immune gene diver-
sity (the MHC) and macroparasite burden, in a group
of neotropical catshes (the Corydoradinae) that have
undergone multiple WGDs, ranging from ancient pale-
opolyploid events ( ~40 mya) to relatively recent dupli-
cations ( ~1-2 mya). The Corydoradinae are widely over
South America and comprise more than 170 described30 EvolDir February 1, 2013
species divided into 9 lineages. The group demon-
strate multiple genome duplication events (polyploidy)
and also exhibit complex mimetic colour pattern re-
lationships1. Using sympatric communities of species
(which should theoretically be exposed to the same par-
asites) that vary in ploidy level, this project will: 1)
use next generation sequencing to quantify MHC di-
versity in taxa that range from diploid to potentially
16x ploid; (2) quantify macroparasite burdens in mul-
tiple sympatric communities consisting of diploid and
polyploid species (3) investigate the role of additional
host-specic factors that may inuence macroparasite
burdens such as size, age, diet and population demo-
graphics. The successful applicant join the group of Dr
Martin Taylor who has recently moved to UEA (see 2)
and will receive training in next generation sequencing
and associated bioinformatic analysis as well as more
traditional techniques such as parasitology. There will
also be opportunities for conducting eldwork in South
America with Brazilian collaborators.

TelomeresSeychellesWarblers
A 3.5 year PhD project is available at the University
of East Anglia, Norwich, UK investigating \Telomeres
as biomarkers of costs and quality in a wild population
of Seychelles warblers". The successful applicant will
be based in the research group of David Richardson
(david.richardson@uea.ac.uk).
Applications must be received in full by 28th February
2013. Further details and information on how to
apply can be found at http://www.uea.ac.uk/study/-postgraduate/research-degrees/science/biological-
sciences . Project Description Every organism has
a nite amount of resources it can use to survive
and reproduce. Resources spent on one area, e.g.
health, cannot be spent on another, e.g. reproduction.
Consequently organisms must work out how best to
spend their resources so as to maximise the benets
they gain. Such trade-os are central to the evolution
of dierent life-history strategies, i.e. why organisms
dier in aspects such as size, reproduction rate and
lifespan, a fundamental part of biology. The problem is
that, although it is relatively easy to assess the benet
of investment in an area, to understand trade-os we
also need to know the costs. Unfortunately, measuring
these has proved to be extremely dicult, especially in
wild animals.
Telomeres are long, specialized regions of DNA which
protect the ends of chromosomes and prevent the genes
from getting damaged or mixed up when the cell repli-
cates. However, a section of telomere is lost with each
replication and when telomeres reach a critical short
length the cell stops functioning. Accumulation of these
dysfunctional cells in the bodies' tissues contributes to
organismal senescence and mortality. Importantly the
rate at which telomeres shorten is also greatly aected
by oxidative stress - the organisms' inability to cope
with the damaging waste particles of metabolism. Fur-
thermore, oxidative stress/telomere shortening is inu-
enced by life history and environmental stresses (e.g.
accelerated growth or infection). Telomere shortening
can, therefore, indicate the biological cost that such
stresses exact on an individual and provide an impor-
tant link between these and the aging process.
The student will use the unique Seychelles warbler
(SW) system1-3 to undertake a longitudinal study of
telomeres in a wild population. The long-term study
of an isolated island population means we have de-
tailed information on the factors experienced by in-
dividuals each year, linked to annual blood samples
taken from those individuals. We also have accu-
rate measures of survival and reproductive success3.
We recently developed a method to measure telom-
eres from blood samples4 and have shown that telom-
ere shortening reects biological ageing in the SW:
telomere shortening with age diers between individ-
uals and predicts survival and recruitment5. The pro-
posed PhD will now investigate the relative costs of dif-
ferent stresses/experiences by relating annual telomere-
shortening rate to the stresses they have faced in that
year.
Experimental manipulations will allow them to hone in
on specic factors, i.e. reproductive eort and help-
ing behaviour. Importantly comparisons, not only be-February 1, 2013 EvolDir 31
tween stresses, but also in respect to the age and life-
history stage at which they are experienced, can be
made. This will allow the student to compare how the
costs and benets of investment in dierent life-history
components, or in dealing with environmental stresses,
are traded o. Finally, the student will test the idea
that individual variation in telomere shortening reects
an individual's ability to withstand these stresses and,
therefore, provides an indicator of individual quality.
The student will be involved in all aspects of eld and
laboratory work and collaborate with an international
team of researchers working on the SW.

Unravelling the disease and tness consequences of
MHC diversity in a uniquely well-characterised sheep
population.
Prof. J.M. Pemberton (University of Edinburgh) & Dr.
K. Ballingall (Moredun Research Institute)The vertebrate major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) is a genome region of exceptional complexity
and allelic diversity with known roles in the immune
response to pathogens and autoimmunity, yet the se-
lective forces that promote this diversity are poorly
understood and much argued about. For example,
the exceptionally high levels of allelic diversity is vari-
ously explained by one or a combination of the follow-
ing: frequency-dependent selection, heterozygote ad-
vantage, the accumulation of linked recessive deleteri-
ous mutations or mate choice [1,2].
This study will explore the evolution of the MHC over
a 27-year period in the exceptionally well-characterised
free-living, unmanaged Soay sheep population of St.
Kilda [3], building on a previous study which demon-
strated dierences in the parasite resistance and t-
ness of individuals carrying dierent MHC class II
DRB1 alleles [4]. We will apply sequence-based sheep
MHC genotyping methods in use at the Moredun In-
stitute [5] to genotype the polymorphic regions of the
classical class II DR and DQ as well as the linked
class I MHC loci. Available pedigree and SNP chip
data will be used to assign alleles to haplotypes and
if necessary haplotype-specic single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNP) and/or microsatellite markers will be
used to allow rapid haplotype analysis within the wider
sample collection.
Associations between alleles at individual loci, haplo-
types or genotypes and tness and phenotypic traits
such as parasite burdens and immunological measures
will be investigated, while accounting for genome-wide
genetic similarity and inbreeding, in order to quantify
selection on the MHC and investigate how allelic vari-
ation is maintained over time.

PhD position: Evolutionary Ecology of Fungal Killers,
University of Exeter
We are looking to recruit a highly-motivated and ded-
icated student with a real interest in applying evolu-
tionary biology to antimicrobial resistance and we are
inviting applications for this BBSRC-funded PhD stu-
dentship to commence September 2013 at the Univer-
sity of Exeter supervised by Dr Ivana Gudelj and Prof.
Ken Haynes.
Fungal diseases devastate human lives. Bloodstream
infections are the second biggest killer of hospital pa-
tients with almost 50% of infections proving fatal, lead-
ing to 1.5 million patient deaths worldwide each year.
However, fungal infections are not well-understood and
there is much less public awareness than for diseases
caused by bacterial and viral infections.
We therefore urgently need to understand how fun-
gal pathogens evolve, adapt to dierent environments
and become resistant to drugs. This is the research
goal of a fully-funded PhD scholarship in Biosciences at
the University of Exeter. The successful applicant will
participate in a lively research environment where we
combine mathematical modeling with an experimental
evolutionary approach to build new theories and test
them in the lab. We are looking for PhD students, ei-
ther experimental or theoretical with a biological or a
physics background, to join our interdisciplinary team
in a unique environment where theoreticians and ex-
perimentalists share a common research vision.
We expect to apply diverse experimental and theoret-
ical tools, from the molecular and genetic to the evo-
lutionary and ecological, depending on the successful
candidate and full training will be provided as appro-
priate.You must have obtained, or be about to obtain, a
First or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree, or
the equivalent qualications gained outside the UK,
in Biology, Physics, Mathematics or a relevant sub-
ject. The studentship will cover a stipend for at
least three years at the standard Research Council
rate (currently $13,590 per annum for 2012-2013),
research costs and tuition fees at the UK/EU rate
for students who meet the residency requirements
outlined by BBSRC (http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/web/-

dents from EU countries who do not meet the residency
requirements may still be eligible for a fees-only award.

Student stage in Behavioral Ecology (f/m)
Project title
Plasticity of multimodal communication under sexual
selection in a buttery,/Bicyclus anynana/
Position and peculiarity
A 3- to 5-month student stage (Bachelor or Mas-
ter) is available at the Biodiversity Research Cen-
tre, Earth and Life Institute, University of Louvain-la-
Neuve (UCL) in Belgium (http://www.uclouvain.be/-
en-bdiv.html), preferentially starting in February-
March 2013.
Description of the project
Individuals often show large phenotypic variation in
sexual traits (signals and preferences), which aect
their reproductive success. Phenotypic variation may
be due to their genotype, to the environment(s) in
which their phenotype is present, and to genotype-by-
environment interactions (GEIs). The impact of GEIs
on sexual selection has only recently drawn the at-
tention of researchers. The project aims at assessing
the role of GEIs on the variation observed in sexual
traits and tests whether such variation has an adap-
tive value in mate choice. An integrative approach
will allow investigating:1) multiple phenotypic (visual,
olfactory, gustatory) traits to grasp the full pheno-type of the organism, forming its \lifestyle", and 2)
the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity in both
sexual signals and preferences in both sexes. More
specically, the project will aim at identifying the ex-
tent of plastic and genetic eects in male-female in-
teractions due to signaling and preference for signals.
Methods will include behavioral, chemical and sta-
tistical analyses to test the extent with which sex-
ual signals and preference depend on individual qual-
ity, experience and on environmental conditions (e.g.[1
<#ENREF 1>,2<#ENREF 2>]). The species un-
der focus is anAfrican tropical buttery/Bicyclus any-
nana/, in which mutual mate choice and ornamen-
tation has recently been shown[3 <#ENREF 3>].
This species is a model lab-reared system for stud-
ies in phenotypic plasticity, sexual selection and multi-
modal sexual communication[4 <#ENREF 4>]. Sev-
eral sexually selected signals have recently been identi-
ed, namely male sex pheromones[5 <#ENREF 5>,6
<#ENREF 6>] and the UV-reectance of male and
female forewing eyespot centres[3 <#ENREF 3>,7
<#ENREF 7>]. We expect the results to contribute
signicantly to our understanding of the role pheno-
typic plasticity in sexual traits and other life history
traits may play in population or species adaption to
reproduce in their environment.
Tasks
The student will participate to a large projectas de-
tailed in the above description. She/he will have the
opportunity to work on a specic question (to be de-
ned based on the student's own interest) and to de-
velop various theoretical and technical skills in an inte-
grative manner.
Requirements
We are looking for a strongly motivated candidate with
advanced courses inEvolutionary and/or Behavioral Bi-
ology and Ecology. Experience in behavioral and/or
chemical ecology is a plus, as is the ability to work ef-
ciently, independently as well as in collaboration.
Work environment
The student will work in a highly active and integrated
academic environment, in the research team of Prof.
C. Nieberding, including Dr. MJ Holveck and other
postdocs, PhDs and students, and will interact with
members of other research teams of the Institute, in-

A three year PhD project is available at the University
of Stirling, Scotland, UK, working on genetic diversity
and local adaptation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)
in the UK. The successful applicant will be based in
the research group of Dr Alistair Jump (University of
Stirling) and will work closely with Dr Stephen Cavers
(CEH Edinburgh) with additional project input fromFebruary 1, 2013 EvolDir 37
Dr Richard Ennos (University of Edinburgh) and Dr
Joan Cottrell (Forest Research). The project is funded
at the basic UK research council rate by the University
of Stirling, the Scottish Forestry Trust and CEH.
This three-year PhD project will use existing data and
landscape models to assess historical migration scenar-
ios and the development of patterns of neutral and
adaptive genetic structure. This will be complemented
by ne-scale analysis of selected native pinewoods to
test hypotheses on the maintenance of high within-
population diversity and to explore the consequences
of human landscape modication for genetic diversity.
Published genetic and palaeoecological data will be in-
tegrated with functional diversity and trait data held
by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH Ed-
inburgh) and the University of Edinburgh. The work
will centre on three main components: 1) Understand-
ing the development of genetic structure during histor-
ical Scots pine migration. 2) Determining how high
within-population genetic diversity is developed and
maintained. 3) Assessing how native trees and non-
local planted trees interact to shape the future diversity
of Scots pine.

EvolutionLifeHistory
Using telomere dynamics to detect a physiological con-
straint on the pace of life-histories The Hawkesbury In-
stitute for the Environment (HIE) at the University
of Western Sydney, Australia, is seeking a PhD candi-
date to work on a project in the eld of animal physi-
ological ecology. The PhD candidate is anticipated to
commence in rst semester 2013. The project broadly
seeks to understand the physiological basis of trade-os
in life history ecology. In particular, it will test the hy-
pothesis that oxidative stress is a cost associated with
increased investment in current production relative to
future survival. The project will use a novel index of
cumulative oxidative damage to nuclear DNA: rate of
telomere shortening in telomerase-knockout mice.
The candidate will design and conduct a series of38 EvolDir February 1, 2013
hypothesis-driven experiments to determine how vari-
ation in the pace of key life-history traits aect rates
of telomere shortening and other molecular indices of
oxidative stress. These experiments will shed light on
the potential for individual mice to make physiologi-
cal adjustments in response to perceived environmental
conditions that maximise lifetime tness but are asso-
ciated with variation in rates of decline in physiological
function. The task of the PhD candidate will be to de-
sign and undertake a series of experiments that address
the aims of the project, including: contribute to the in-
novation, design and day-to-day running of experimen-
tal treatments, sampling, extraction and amplication
of DNA using real-time (quantitative) PCR, develop-
ment of other molecular assays (i.e. immunoassay kits,
GC-MS) of oxidative stress, measure other physiologi-
cal variables (e.g. body temperature) using telemetry
and respirometry techniques.
The student will be supervised by Dr Christopher Tur-
bill (HIE) and Professor Rob Brooks, Director of the
Evolution and Ecology Research Centre at the Univer-
sity of New South Wales. Criteria The successful ap-
plicant should: demonstrate excellent academic perfor-
mance related to the research proposed, hold qualica-
tions and experience equal to an Australian First Class
Bachelor Honours degree, be highly motivated to un-
dertake further study at an advanced level, preferably
have a background that includes the elds of compar-
ative animal physiology, metabolism and ageing, free
radical biology, and the evolution of variation in life
history traits.

PhD position "Evolutionary forces and genetic mecha-
nisms underlying sexual dimorphism: insights from the
fungal kingdom'
A 4-year PhD-student position is currently available at
the Department of Evolutionary Biology, Uppsala Uni-
versity, Sweden.
Sexual dimorphism is the systematic distinction in phe-
notype between individuals of the two sexes in dioe-
cious species. Males and females dier in numerous fea-
tures, which is thought to be a result of natural and/or
sexual selection for traits that inuence the tness of
each sex. Nevertheless, we are still at the beginning of
understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms and
evolutionary forces driving sexual dimorphism. Emerg-
ing data from the fungal kingdom suggests that fungi
present new opportunities to test hypotheses about the
evolution of genetically dierent sexes and the related
phenotypic divergence. Until now, sexual dimorphism
has not been recognized in the fungal kingdom. Al-
though male and female reproductive structures exist in
fungi, phenotypic traits are generally exchangeable and
reciprocal between strains of dierent mating types. As
for most lamentous ascomycetes, the mating type in
the model species Neurospora crassa is governed by two
alternative alleles at a single mating-type locus. In con-
trast, in the congeneric species N. tetrasperma, a large
(~7 Mbp, >1,500 genes) region of suppressed recombi-
nation surrounds and includes the mating-type locus.
Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the suppressed re-
combination evolved less than 2 MYA but is associated
with substantial DNA sequence divergence between the
mating-type chromosomes. Recent data from our re-
search group suggest that N. tetrasperma exhibit con-
sequent mating-type linked transcriptional divergence.
Furthermore, our data indicate that the phenotypes of
strains of dierent mating types in N. tetrasperma are
optimized for traits promoting development of male or
female features. These ndings illustrate a possible
analogue to sexual dimorphism in the fungal kingdom.February 1, 2013 EvolDir 39
This PhD-project aims at using large-scale ge-
nomic/transcriptomic data together with mating ex-
periments of Neurospora to test hypotheses about the
driving forces and genetic mechanisms of sexual di-
morphism. The PhD student will be part of Dr.
Hanna Johannesson's lab at the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Center, EBC. The Johannesson lab has a broad
interest in eukaryote genome evolution. In partic-
ular, the research utilizes genomic and experimental
data to infer the connection between reproductive be-
havior and genome evolution. The project is in col-
laboration with the group of Dr. Simone Immler,
whose research focus lays on in particular sexual se-
lection, the evolution of gametes and the consequences
of bi-phasic eukaryotic life cycle. The project is an-
nounced in combination with a postdoc position on
multilevel selection, thus here are ample opportuni-
ties to work closely with postdocs and other PhD stu-
dents in the lab that focus on related projects. The
research environment is international with English be-
ing the working language. See Johannesson and Immler

research in evolutionary biology in a broad sense, with
research programs including ecology, systematics, ge-
netics, genomics, and developmental biology. Uppsala
University is the oldest university in Scandinavia and
the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with beau-
tiful surroundings conveniently situated 40 minutes by

in Systems Biology Systems and Synthetic Biology WU
1 fte
We are looking for Systems Biology is one of the spear-
heads of the Wageningen UR, which invests consider-
ably in this area. The Wageningen Centre for Systems
Biology (WCSB) has been recently launched with a
focus on the Systems Biology of Biobased Economy,
Food and Health. The research programme within the
WCSB runs across with three main subthemes: Virtual
Gut, Virtual Plant, and Virtual Microbe. Within the
Wageningen Centre for Systems Biology two PhD mod-
eling positions are available in the themes Virtual Gut
and Virtual Microbe respectively. Each of these mod-
eling project is matched by at least one experimental
project, with strong interactions between model and
experiments envisaged.
We are looking for enthusiastic, motivated and highly
qualied PhD candidates with a strong background in
or anity to modeling of biological systems. Candi-
dates should have strong mathematical and/ or statis-
tical modelling skills, be uent in English (both written
and spoken), proactive, independent, team players and
have the ability to engage with professionals in adjoin-
ing elds. Below you will nd information on the re-
search projects available and on the requirements of the
position. More information is available on the website:
www.wageningenur.nl/systemsbiology . PhD Position
1: Development of probabilistic models for quantitative
pathway and response analysis of human intestinal and
immune responses to food The homeostasis of the small
intestine and its lining immune system can be mod-
ulated by various food-products. To eciently study
and, ultimately, predict the eects of food-products on
homeostasis, we resort to systems biology-based math-
ematical models. By drawing on previously acquiredFebruary 1, 2013 EvolDir 41
knowledge, available literature and data to be gener-
ated in matching experimental projects, we aim to con-
struct an in silico pathway-network model of the most
important hubs for local and systemic immune signals
of the gut and lined immune cells. This model, which
will involve multilevel responses and is to enable pre-
dictions of the eect of polysaccharides, and pre- and
probiotics, will be tested iteratively by comparing its
outcomes to in vitro results.
PhD Position 2: Systems Biology of microalgae as pho-
tosynthetic platform for tailored production of chem-
ical building blocks and biomass This computational
Systems Biology project aims to develop an experi-
mentally tested modelling framework for the under-
standing of the metabolic and regulatory wiring of
selected microalgae as photosynthetic platform for 'a
la carte' production of chemical building blocks and
biomass in sustainable value chains. The project will
be tightly intertwined with research activities in match-
ing projects in the scope of a broader initiative on mi-
croalgae for innovative biorenery, as summarised in

\Natural History Museum
Researcher in Biosystematics - 12 month contract
The Natural History Museum announced a 12-month
contract as a researcher (1109) in biosystematics for
work within two externally funded projects. Working
time is divided 50% on each of the projects.
One project is funded by the Species Project / Species
Data Bank, entitled "Mapping of lecideoid lichens in
Norway: Building a DNA barcode library.\ The project
will primarily go out to ll a library of DNA bar-
codes for Norwegian lecideoide lichen with data for 200
species. The barcodes must usually be generated from
materials that are not older than 10 years, eldwork
and species identication are an important part of the
project. The researcher will be responsible for analy-
sis of material and technical evaluation of the results,
including the detection of unknown genetic variation /cryptic species and new phylogenetic understanding.
The second project, "Areas for red-listed species - map-
ping and monitoring (ARKO)\, is a project funded
by several ministries, and NHM has the responsibility
to create a monitoring program to conserve biodiver-
sity in the natural kind of open shallow limestone soils
in boreonemoral zone (mainly in the Oslofjord area).
This habitat type is likely home to many red-listed
species of lichens to be evaluated within the project.
The researcher will work with genetic analysis (includ-
ing DNA barcoding) of taxonomically problematic Red-
Listed species of lichens on shallow limestone soils in the
Oslofjord area.
We seek a person with a PhD in botany or mycology

*** Director, Tennenbaum Marine Observatories
Smithsonian Institution
The Smithsonian Institution seeks an innovative leader
for the newly endowed Tennenbaum Marine Observato-
ries (TMO). For more information on the TMO, please
visit: http://www.si.edu/marinegeo/ . The Smithso-
nian has launched the TMO, an initiative envisioned as
a long-term, global-scale network of ecological observa-
tories that will be dedicated to understanding changes
in the structure and function of marine ecosystems.
This network is committed to innovative measurements
and experiments that will span traditional disciplinary
boundaries and be executed in a standardized fashion
over exceptional spatial and temporal scales. It is an-
ticipated that this approach will lead to a new and fun-
damental understanding of our oceans that supports
sustainable use.
The TMO will build upon the extraordinary strengths,
capacity, and leadership of the Smithsonian Institution
in marine sciences. With over 50 marine scientists, the
Smithsonian expertise provides considerable depth that
spans many disciplines in biology, ecology, evolutionary
biology, paleobiology, anthropology, systematics, geo-
chemistry, genetics, and other areas. The Smithsonian
also has excellent infrastructure for marine science, in-
cluding marine laboratories in Maryland, Florida, Be-
lize, and Panama. The founding director of the TMO
will have the opportunity to lead a cutting-edge re-
search program that will result in high prole, policy-
relevant discoveries.
Characteristics that we seek in a director include: *
Record of experience and scholarly achievement in core
areas of TMO research. * Evidence of innovative ap-
proaches and ability to integrate ideas/concepts across
traditional disciplinary boundaries. * Clear record as
an eective leader in developing and implementing a
major research program and in working with diverse
groups of people both inside and outside the home insti-
tution. * Demonstrated strong organization and man-
agement skills. * Ability to serve as the spokesper-
son/ambassador to other Smithsonian programs, out-
side collaborators, donors, and the public. * Successful
track record of competitive grant funding.
The director will be based at the National Museum
of Natural History (http://www.mnh.si.edu/) in Wash-
ington DC, with the opportunity to establish close
aliations with one or more other research units
at the Smithsonian including the Smithsonian Envi-
ronmental Research Center (http://www.serc.si.edu),

/www.stri.si.edu), and the Smithsonian Conserva-February 1, 2013 EvolDir 55
tion Biology Institute (http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/-
default.cfm). The director will guide all aspects of
the design, development, implementation and growth of
this new initiative, in consultation with TMO partici-
pants, and will manage all TMO activities both nation-
ally and internationally. The Smithsonian Institution
is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
This is a full-time, permanent position located in Wash-
ington, DC with a pay range of $150,000 to $165,300.

USussex BeeAdaptation
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Bee Ecology and Eco-
toxicology Three year post, available from 1 April
2013, based at the University of Sussex (Falmer, near
Brighton, UK). Closing date 15 February 2013.
A full-time, Defra-funded, 3-year postdoctoral research
position is available to join a research team in the
School of Life Sciences at the University of Sussex, UK.
The programme of research is led by Prof Dave Goul-
son (currently relocating from University of Stirling to
University of Sussex). The main aim of the project is
to improve our understanding of the impact of pesti-
cides on wild bumblebee populations in arable farm-
land, horticultural areas and gardens. In particular,
we will focus on how bee foraging behaviour and dif-
ferences between bee species inuences their exposure
to pesticides. This is currently an area of considerable
controversy; we anticipate the potential for high impact
publications.
The project will involve collection of eld samples ofpollen, nectar, vegetation and bees for screening for
neonicotinoid insecticides, and performing a variety of
eld experiments. The screening will be carried out
in conjunction with Prof E Hill, and technical support
is available for this. Expertise in chemical analysis if
therefore not needed, but the fellow will be expected
to become familiar with interpretation and analysis of
outputs.
The successful applicant will have a PhD in ecology.
Experience with social insects, pollinators, agroecosys-
tems and / or pesticides is desirable but not essential.
Knowledge of experimental design and analysis is essen-
tial. A driving licence is essential, since the appointee
will spend considerable time visiting remote eld sites
across SE England.
The appointee will also be part of the Evolution,
Behaviour and Environment (EBE) Subject Group
in the School of Life Sciences at Sussex (http://-
www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/ebe/research), a thriving re-
search environment providing ample opportunities to
interact with leading senior researchers and their
groups. The successful applicant will particularly bene-
t from an exceptional (on a world scale) concentration
of research expertise that focusses on social insects: in
addition to Dave Goulson, Jeremy Field, Francis Rat-
nieks, Bill Hughes, Tom Collett and Paul Graham all
lead well-established research groups.
APPLICATIONS PROCEDURE Applications should
include a CV, a covering letter explaining the appli-
cant's suitability for the post, and a completed Univer-
sity of Sussex application form. This should include: 1.
Contact details (including e-mail addresses) for the ap-
plicant and 3 referees who would be available to provide
references before interview (during the month after the
closing date). 2. The applicant's availability for inter-
view at Sussex University during the 3 weeks after the
closing date. 3. A clear statement that (a) the appli-
cant would be available to start work on 1 April 2013
or soon thereafter; (b) the applicant has a full driving
licence.
Salary scale is $30 424 to $36 298 per year, plus super-
annuation.

Articial Evolving Systems
Call for Papers Special Issue on Evolvability and Ro-
bustness in Articial Evolving Systems for the Springer
journal Genetic Programming and Evolvable MachinesExtended Deadline April 30, 2013
The journal Genetic Programming and Evolvable Ma-
chines (GPEM) was founded to focus on articial evo-
lutionary systems that are active \ which take inputs
from their environment and act on them to produce
their behavior.
Short- and long-term evolution depends on the "vari-
ational properties\ (Altenberg, 1994) of the systems "
how changes to their structure map to changes in their
behavior. Robustness and evolvability are key varia-
tional properties that themselves show evolutionary dy-
namics. Active systems are an especially rich domain
for the evolution of robustness and evolvability since
they often allow for open-ended complexity.
GPEM is calling for papers for a special issue on Evolv-
ability and Robustness in Articial Evolving Systems.
\Articial" may include any model that departs from,
or is more general, than what is found in nature. A
diversity of concepts under the rubrics of evolvability
and robustness have been introduced as the literature
on these subjects has expanded. This special issue is
open to the full range of these concepts. However, con-
fusion has entered the literature due to imprecise usage
of these terms. Therefore, a unique requirement for this
special issue will be that the authors provide precise
quantitative denitions for the aspects of evolvability
and robustness they investigate.
Examples of topics sought include: Generalization of
the biological concept of distribution of mutation ef-
fects on tness to the distribution of genetic operator
eects on the objective functions in AESs (Nordin and
Banzhaf, 1995);
Relationships between 1) the robustness of the behavior
to variation in inputs and environment, and 2) its ro-
bustness under change from the genetic operators (e.g.
plasto-genetic congruence Ancel and Fontana (2000));
The emergence, or the engineering, of evolvability or
robustness into articial evolutionary systems (AESs);
New theoretical understanding of the evolution of
evolvability, robustness, neutral networks, and their
inter-relationships;
Case studies of the evolution of evolvability, robustness,
or neutral networks in AESs; Methodology for measur-
ing evolvability and/or robustness;
Mechanisms whereby variational properties of the envi-
ronment or inputs can shape the variational properties
of the AESs under the genetic operators.

Evolution Mammalian Hibernation
Special Issue on The Evolution of Mammalian Hiber-
nation: Genetics, Physiology, Behavior, Ecology, and
Applications to Human Health
Call for Papers
Torpor is hypothesized to be an evolved strategy for
energy conservation in the face of lowered and unpre-
dictable resource availability and is dened by reduced
metabolism and body temperature. Hibernation is a
seasonal behavior wherein the torpid state is extended
for several days to several weeks and is regularly inter-
rupted with spontaneous arousal intervals, when nor-
mal metabolism and body temperatures are reinstated
for 10-20 hours. In the past, hibernation was perceived
to be a response to low temperatures though we now
know that there are numerous species found in warm
climates that show these same extreme physiological
states. Researchers are targeting the genetic, molec-
ular, neurobiological, and physiological components of
hibernation to unveil factors that confer biological pro-
tection against hypothermia, ischemia-reperfusion in-
jury, and disuse atrophy. Results derived from this
research can potentially provide the tools to pharma-
ceutically or genetically induce components of the hi-
bernation state in nonhibernators. We invite interdis-
ciplinary contributions to address fundamental ques-
tions in the evolutionary dynamics of torpor and hiber-
nation and their potential implications for Darwinian
medicine, particularly those that address opposing sides
of current debates in the eld of mammalian hiberna-
tion. Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
- The evolutionary polarity of heterothermy: ances-
tral versus convergent adaptation - Hibernation and
macroevolution: relationship to climate change and en-
vironmental unpredictability - Ecophysiology of tem-
perate/arctic and tropical hibernation: environmental
triggers - Neurophysiology of heterothermy: relation-
ship between hibernation, daily torpor, and sleep - The
role of biological clocks in timing and regulation of
daily torpor and hibernation - Metabolic suppression,
low body temperature, and organ function - Endocrine
control in hibernators: hormones involved in appetite
and metabolic and immune functions - The role of fat

Call for Participants: Evolutionary Biology of the Built
Environment Working Group
We are organizing the rst working group aimed at un-
derstanding the evolutionary biology of the built envi-
ronmentXour bedrooms, our houses, our backyards and
our cities. This working group will occur* June 10 V 14,
2013, in Durham, North Carolina*. We are now invit-
ing applications for participants in the working group:
http://bit.ly/Zm3mdB (Deadline: Jan 25, 2013)
As recently as 100,000 years ago the indoor environ-
ment did not exist. Yet, this is now where most hu-
mans spend the majority of their life. An emerging
body of literature shows that hundreds of multicellu-
lar species and thousands of unicellular species can be
found in houses and buildings more generally. Among
the species found in homes are those whose presence
(or absence) is likely to have a large impact on human
health and well-being, species including benecial mi-crobiota on the body but also pathogens and potential
pathogens or toxic species such as extremophilic fungi.
Yet, with the exception of a few deadly, the evolution-
ary history of most of the species with which we most
intimately interact in our homes remains unknown.
To remedy our lack of knowledge and take advantage
of recent advances in disparate elds we will bring to-
gether scientists studying both the fauna (microbiolo-
gists, entomologists) and environment (engineers, ar-
chitects) along with social scientists (anthropologists)
and evolutionary biologists (e.g. theoreticians, bioin-
formaticians, geneticists) to begin to build a frame-
work for the evolution of the indoor and more generally
built biome. *Our goal is to develop a framework for
a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of the
species we most intimately interact with, particularly
in the context of considering how to build and design
our environments so as to favor benecial (rather than
dangerous) evolutionary trajectories.*

Field Museum summer 2013 undergraduate research in-
ternship opportunities
The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illi-
nois is please to announce its 2013 summer NSF REU
internship program. Please visit the program web site
for information and REU project descriptions:
http://eldmuseum.org/about/c-r-research-
experiences-undergraduates-reu/ All REU ap-
plications must be made online at: http://-
grants.eldmuseum.org/ Application deadline:
February 11th, 2013. Deadline for letters of reference:
February 15th, 2013. Announcement of Awards:
March 15, 2013. Start of 2013 REU program: Mon-
day, June 10, 2013. The 5th Annual Undergraduate
Research Symposium will be held Friday, August 16 at
the Field Museum.
Please note: Undergraduate student participants in
REU Sites must be citizens or permanent residents of
the United States or its possessions and must be a fresh-
man, sophomore or junior at the time of application.
Seniors cannot apply for an REU internship.
The Field Museum houses one of the world's foremost
scientic collections of biological diversity ( >25 mil-
lion specimens), and supports active biodiversity re-
search around the globe. Despite the urgency of the
current biodiversity crisis, few educational opportuni-
ties exist for students in the biological sciences to in-
teract with scientists and institutions dedicated to the
study of organic diversity. The Field Museum REU
program will train a cohort of at least eight studentsin biodiversity-related research in a 10-week summer
program. Each participant will undertake an indepen-
dent research project supervised by a museum scien-
tist in a discipline such as taxonomy and systematics,
phylo/biogeography, paleontology, molecular phyloge-
netics, or conservation. Students will experience bio-
logical diversity through the use of the museum's col-
lections in their research, and will be trained in project-
relevant techniques and equipment such as the scanning
electron microscope, various light microscopy set-ups,
and equipment in the Pritzker DNA lab. A six-week
course in phylogenetic systematics is run concurrently
with intern projects and will provide a common the-
oretical framework for their research. REU students
will receive an introduction to the Encyclopedia of Life
(EOL) in Field Museum's Biodiversity Synthesis Cen-
ter. At the conclusion of the summer students will
present their research results to their peers and museum
scientists at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Providing equal opportunity in biodiversity-related re-
search is an important goal of the program.
REU student participants receive a salary of $4,500 for
the 10-week program, and additionally $2,500 subsis-
tence and $500 travel allowance.
This REU program is funded through a REU-Site grant
from the National Science Foundation to Drs. Petra
Sierwald and Ken Angielczyk (Field Museum of Natu-
ral History).

Fst estimation genome wide answers
Dear Evoldir users,
I sincerely apologize for the delay of this answer.
More than a month ago, I asked for tools that estimate
FST index for each locus for Genome wide data.
I am really grateful to all the users that answered me,
providing a very useful help.72 EvolDir February 1, 2013
First of all, let me say that Bruce Weir sent me an
e mail suggesting me to be cautious about single-SNP
estimates, since the variances are too large.
Please nd below the answers that I received. Please
feel free to contact me for every enquiry.
Hi Francesco,
I used the hierfstat R package for analysis of 13 mio
SNPs in 20 individuals. The variance component es-
timation might not be the fastest, but once you get
SNP-wise estimates, any kind of randomization is fast.
cheers, Reto
Francesco,
The speed of the analysis will depend to a certain extent
on your computers processor and RAM, but I would
recommend Fstat or Genalex.
Good luck,
Dan
Hi,
have you tried hierfstat (R package) and its function
basic.stats (much faster than varcomp.glob)
Dear Francesco,
Hierfstat or Plink should be able to do it.
Armando
Hi Francesco,
Read this post: http://www.molecularecologist.com/-
2012/05/calculating-pair-wise-unbiased-fst-with-r/ I
personally use the Rpackage \hierfstat" to calculate Fst
for>200k SNPs relatively quickly.
I have also used MSA in the past for medium size SNP
datasets. It does the same calculation as Hierfstat.
MSA reference:
Dieringer, D. and Schl otterer, C. (2003), microsatel-
lite analyser (MSA): a platform independent analy-
sis tool for large microsatellite data sets. Molecu-
lar Ecology Notes, 3: 167-169. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-
8286.2003.00351.x
cheer,
sebastien
Dear Francesco,
We use here a software called ADEGENET (R-source)
for large datasets analyses (Gen Div, H&W, FST, Mul-
tivariate analyses).
I would be happy to hear what other suggestions you
receive from the community.Sincerely,
Gregory
Dear Francesco,
we are developing 'PopGenome', a powerful toolbox for
population genetic & genomic data within the R statis-
tics environment (http://www.r-project.org/). A sub-
stantially improved version 1.2 will be online at CRAN
very soon - in the meantime, I'd be happy to email you
(or anyone else interested) the package. It will run on
Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
PopGenome implements a wide range of population ge-
netics statistics and methods, including dierent vari-
ants of F ST. These can be applied to sets of align-
ments, sets of loci within a large SNP le (e.g., 'gene'
or 'exon' regions specied in an annotation le) , or
sliding windows.
At this time PopGenome can read in the following data
formats: Alignments: FASTA, PHYLIP, MAF, MEGA,
NEXUS. SNP data: SNP, VCF, HAPMAP (in partic-
ular les from the 1000/1001 genomes projects)
You can also split large datasets in your own format into
chunks and convert them into R-objects, PopGenome
will concatenate them internally. This mechanism is
well documented and will also be available on CRAN.
To ensure fast computation on a very large scale we
implemented some R specic bottlenecks in C++.
If you have any further questions on PopGenome and
its usage, please ask!
Best wishes,
Bastian

Massive open online courses in
evolution
Hello EvolDir!
I just wanted to do a quick survey to ask if the list is
aware of any Massive Open Online Courses in Evolution
or related topics.
Massive Open Online Courses are learning platforms
that scale teaching and instruction using the web,
videos, assignments, discussion forums, and other forms
of engagement.
MIT's open courseware, Google, P2PU, Coursera,
Udacity, Udemy, and Lore are a few examples of plat-
formsValthough there are others.
Here are two current implementations: EEB
with Stephen Stearns by Yale on Udemy http://-
www.udemy.com/evolution-ecology-and-behavior-122-
with-stephen-c-stearns/ Introduction to Genetics and
Evolution with Mohamed Noor by Duke on Coursera
https://www.coursera.org/course/geneticsevolution
Please share instances of past courses, current oerings,and future courses in the pipeline. These may be ones
oered through a home university, a commercial entity,
or even without direct institutional supportVanywhere
in the world.
And nally, are any of the societies and/or synthe-
sis centers developing directed, open, online education
platforms for broadening engagement around evolution-
ary biology.
I will try to compile the responses and share with the
list.

Anthropologists had a name for the non-independence-

\Galton's Problem", and the promise of comparative
methods for testing hypotheses about cultural adap-

for the eld of cultural phylogenetics. In this talk I will
show how linguistic, cultural, and archaeological data is

Next talk at http://phyloseminar.org/: \Language
phylogenies and cultural evolution" by Simon Green-
hill (Australian National University)
Charles Darwin famously noted that there were many
curious parallels between the evolution of species and
languages. Since then evolutionary biology and histor-
ical linguistics have used trees to conceptualise evolu-
tion. However, whilst evolutionary biology developed
the vast discipline of phylogenetic methods, linguistics
dabbled with computational methods before rejecting
them. The last decade or so has seen the introduc-
tion of phylogenetic methods into linguistics, often with
some startling results. In this talk I will present some
of these studies, and discuss how phylogenetics can help
us grapple with the problems of linguistic and cultural
evolution. These problems range from testing popula-
tion dispersal hypotheses, to investigating the shape of
cultural evolution, to inferring the rates at which lan-
guages change.

Software FLOCK 3 0
Dear EvolDir members,
A new version of FLOCK has been released:
FLOCK is designed to unravel genetic structure within
a collection of genotypes, whether pure or admixed.
It is assumed that pure, \source", samples are not
available. The program may be used to solve the
\number (K) of populations" problem. When K is
already known, it may be used to separate pure and
admixed specimens into K groups. FLOCK is a non-
Bayesian, non MCMC, method and therefore diers
substantially from previous clustering algorithms and
processing time is much shorter. Its working princi-
ple is repeated re-allocation of all collected specimens
(total sample) to k subsamples.
The methods to map genetic admixture on a set of sam-
ples (K known) and to estimate the number of popula-
tions K were described respectively in:
Duchesne P, Turgeon J (2009) FLOCK: a method for
quick mapping of admixture without source samples.
Molecular Ecology Resources 9: 1333-1344
Duchesne P, Turgeon J (2012) FLOCK Provides Reli-
able Solutions to the \Number of Populations" Problem
Journal of Heredity 2012; doi: 10.1093/jhered/ess038
A new version (3.0) of FLOCK is currently available.
In this latest version, the criteria used to select the
\best" run for a given value of the parameter k has
been changed. In the two previous versions, the run
with the highest Mean LLOD was selected. A set of
runs that repeatedly generate an identical k-partition of
the genotypes is termed a "plateau" and their number
the "plateau length". Recently, a large number of simu-
lations have shown that runs that belong to the longest
plateau generate more accurate partitions (references)
generally. Therefore this version selects as \best" one
run among those that have produced the largest set of
identical partitions.

Software Paternity
Dear Evoldir members,
I have just released and application called Uncer-
tainPaternity Coancestry (UPC).
This programme is intended to calculate the coancestry
matrix for a pedigree when uncertainty about the par-
ents of some individuals exists. We may have individu-
als with more than one possible father and/or mother.
Then, probability of receiving an allele from these po-
tential parents has to be divided between them, follow-
ing the approach presented in P erez-Enciso (1995). All
candidates are assumed to be equally probable. The
software also provides a simple pedigree analysis that
could be restricted to a portion of the genealogy (what
will be called the 'cohort of interest'). Average in-
breeding and coancestry, founder contributions, eec-
tive number of founder and non-founders as well as
founder genome equivalents will be calculated. Realise
that although averages will be calculated for the in-
dicated individuals (the cohort of interest), particular
values account for the whole pedigree.
Software can be freely downloaded from my personal
web page (see address below). Hope somebody nd it
useful.
Best regards.

SouthAfrica Volunteers
EvolStripedMiceFebruary 1, 2013 EvolDir 79
2 volunteers needed from May / June 2013 onwards
2 volunteers needed from August 2013 onwards
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to eco-physiology, animal behavior, evolution, and
ecology before starting an MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of eld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood sam-
ples are collected for physiological measurements. Vol-
unteers are expected to help with maintenance of the
research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1250 (around 180 US$, 120 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
2500, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$, 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use toapply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
2 volunteers starting in May / June and 2 in August
2013. Volunteers are expected to stay at least three
months, but longer periods of up to 6months are pre-
ferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

and (ii) high-throughput sequencing techniques.
If you know one, would you please be so kind to let
us know ? We are notably interested in answering the
following aspects :
- Regarding phylogenetics : i) learn the general meth-
ods of tree reconstruction ii) get specic guidelines for
methods choice in tree reconstruction iii) how to pro-
duce phylogenetic trees from biological material ? iv)
how to use phylogenetic trees to analyse patterns of
geographic distribution, or phenotypic evolution? v)
learn to use specic softwares vi) ...
- Regarding high throughput sequencing : i) learn how
to choose the best general methods for one's question
ii) learn to use specic programs or applications iii)
how to design the biological experiment at best for the
appropriate methodology ? iv) ...
Any suggestion would be strongly appreciated. Thank
you very much in advance !

The last few decades have witnessed the burgeoning
of many highly productive lines of investigation into
abiogenesis and the early emergence of biological com-
plexity. Planetary sciences and geochemistry have pro-
duced a short-list of well-studied settings where pre-
biotic chemistry may have led to the transition from
non-living to living matter. Major advances in abiotic
syntheses of important biomolecules have resulted in
an improved understanding of the relative availabilities
of proto-biomolecules. The continuing growth of bioin-
formatics databases has given computational biologists
an unprecedented ability to reconstruct the properties
of early organisms and ancient evolutionary histories.
Synthetic biology now allows investigators to examine
the boundaries of life's genetic systems and minimal life
in the laboratory. In general, the advance of astrobi-
ology has expanded our understanding of habitability
and life as cosmological phenomena. This workshop will
integrate these themes, foster new local, national and
international collaborations, and actively encourage sci-
entists from within and outside the Princeton commu-
nity to pursue studies of life's origins. The workshop
program will bring together researchers in these dis-parate subjects and subelds to address the questions
of life's origins in the astronomical, chemical, genetic,
evolutionary, and information-theoretic contexts.

iPad app for Evolution

iPad Apps
Chapters 1-8 of Carl Zimmer and Doug Emlen's Evo-
lution: Making Sense of Life iPad app will be available
10/19/12 in the Apple app store. Chapters can be pur-
chased individually for $4.99 up to $9.99. Chapters 1
and 8 (on natural selection) can be downloaded at no
charge.
Peter Grant at Princeton University describes the book
this way: \Two master craftsmen in the art of scientic
communication have combined to produce an excellent
basic text on Evolution: it informs, explains, and in-
spires."
We hope the interactive app will make learning even
more inspirational and educational. The authors have
used various techniques to prompt students from read-
ing passively into actively working with the concepts;
for instance, they have added hundreds of reading com-
prehension questions, so students receive immediate
feedback as they read. Many of these questions are not
only motivating, but they also address common mis-
conceptions.
Soaring Textbook Prices
As a company, we're taking seriously the problem of
soaring textbook prices. As proof, we recently slugged
Whitlock and Schluter's The Analysis of Biological
Data into a cool Amazon price tracker. The average
price of the book (since publication in 2009) was $85.74.
We thought this was too high, though we were some-
what relieved when we looked at the book's major com-
petitors. Samuels and Witmer has an average price of
$126.42. Zar's average price is $128.10. And Moore
and Baldi's average price is $127.12. Now used at well
over 100 schools, Whitlock and Schluter is no doubt
the gold standard for teaching biological statistics. Stu-
dents who use the book not only get a great read, full of84 EvolDir February 1, 2013
fascinating and relevant biological examples, but they
also save on average over $41.
Tree Thinking
We're pleased to announce the publication of David
Baum and Stacey Smith's Tree Thinking: An Intro-
duction to Phylogenetic Biology.
Jack Sullivan, President of the Society of Systematic
Biologists, says \Tree thinking will be a critical tool inthe arsenal of those of us who train the next generation
of evolutionary biologists."
To celebrate the book's publication, we're oering it for
$37.50 (50% o the list price) until November 15th. Use
coupon code TREE. Oer does not include shipping of
$5.00. Limit one copy per customer.

Dear colleague,
I would like to bring under your attention a two years
postdoc position, which will be soon available in my
lab to work on the molecular mechanisms of evolution
of /Bacillus cereus/, a sporeforming food-borne oppor-
tunistic pathogen, in the environment (see the attached
announcement). The purpose is to understand how
quickly this species evolves in natural conditions, what
constrains that rate and what evolutionary mechanisms
it uses for adaptation and evolution. The fellowship
could start at any time from March-April 2013.
Maybe you know a good candidate, or maybe you could
advertise this position or forward this announcement to
colleagues and collaborators?
Thank you for your help.

*Evolution of a sporeforming food-borne opportunistic
pathogen in the environment*
A postdoctoral position is available for at least two
years (with possible extension depending on fund-
ing) on a project funded by the Agence Nationale
dela Recherche (ANR) BIOADAPT Programme to
work on experimental evolution of bacterial pathogenic-
ity. The position is available in the group of Di-
dier Lereclus (http://www.micalis.fr/micalis/Poles-et-
Equipes/Pole-Risques/GME- Lereclus) at the \Gut Mi-
crobiology for Human Health Institute" (MICALIS)
with the aim to* *investigate the evolution in the
environment of/Bacillus cereus/, a human food-borne
pathogen, and to assess the risk of emergence of strains
with higher virulence to mammals.The goal is to un-
derstandhow quickly this species evolves in natural
conditions, what constrains that rateand what evolu-
tionary mechanisms it uses for adaptation and evolu-
tion.The recruited postdoc will be part of the ANR
\PathoBactEvol" project which includes six French
academic partners and two European collaborating
teams.
In this project the insect Galleria mellonellalarvae will
be used as a host and its digestive tract as a selection
medium to select novel pathogenic strains. The prin-
ciple will be to set up a serial passage experiment of
B. cereusin the insect, to select more virulent bacterial
strains and study how they have evolved. Emphasis will
be put on comparative whole genome analysis of mul-
tiple evolved strains (or lineages) and in understanding
how dierent life traits evolve in dierent conditions.
Integration of genomic and phenotypic data, using com-
putational approaches, should then allow us to explain
phenotypic dierences in terms of genotypic dierences.
An examination of how the genomes and phenotypes of
the evolved strains have changed will also permit to
identify the selective pressures they have experienced
and how this is related to tness improvement.
The candidate will be in charge ofestablishing a pow-
erful and versatile model for analysing the causes and
processes of evolutionary adaptation, including direct
observation of evolution in action and under uctuat-
ing conditions.He will also participate in the analysis ofthe genomic sequence data generated using novel high
throughput sequencing technologies (NGS) to provide
the data necessary to describe the complete set of genes
implicated in these adaptation processes.
Interested candidates must hold a PhD in evolutionary
biology or in related areas and are expected to have
some experience in theoretical quantitative genetics and
evolutionary ecology. Additional skillsin genomics, ap-
plied mathematics and/or in using bioinformatic tools
will be an advantage.A capacity to work independently,
as well as good communication abilities, are also re-
quired.
The MICALIS institute (www.micalis.fr) is a high-
prole Microbiology center and a \joint research unit"

Lyon ReconstructingGenomes
Integrative methods for reconstructing ancestral
genomes
A 2 (+1) year post-doctoral position is available to
work on integrative methods for reconstructing ances-
tral genomes in the Bioinformatics and Genome Evolu-
tion (BGE) group at the LBBE in Lyon, France (http:/-
/lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=en).
The researcher will work in collaboration with Vincent
Daubin, Bastien Boussau, Gergely Szollosi and Eric
Tannier, in the context of the ANCESTROME project.ANCESTROME (http://ancestrome.univ-lyon1.fr) is a
large collaborative project funded by the French Na-
tional Research Agency .
The project aims at building integrative models and
studying the genomes of extant living organisms to re-
construct evolutionary intermediates together with the
evolutionary processes that have generated them. A
critical step in the development of methods to recon-
struct the evolution of genomes is the modeling of the
processes that relate gene phylogenies to species phy-
logenies. We have developed methods for integrating
events of gene duplication, gene loss and lateral gene
transfer in the simultaneous reconstruction of species
and gene histories. These methods yield much better
estimates of the gene content of ancestral genome, and
hence open the door to accurate reconstructions of an-
cestral species characteristics. These include not only
cellular and genome organization, or metabolic capabil-
ities, as deduced from genome content, but also virtu-
ally any internal or external factor that has left a trace
in the genomic record, in particular details of the envi-
ronment to which the species has adapted, its resources,
symbionts or demography.
In a series of recent papers, we have used probabilis-
tic models and high performance computing meth-
ods on the HOGENOM (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/-
databases/hogenom/acceuil.php) database to start ex-
ploiting genomes as documents of evolutionary history
(see references below).
Possible avenues of research include:
- Reconstructing ancestral genomes, phenotypes and
environments
- Modeling coevolution of genes and genomes...
The successful candidate will have a strong background
in computational biology or probabilistic models. Good
programming skills are essential. A good understand-
ing of the concepts of evolutionary biology is a plus.
The LBBE oers a highly stimulating scientic en-
vironment, and Lyon is a lively, beautiful, history
rich city (see http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/872/) with
great food. The researcher will also have the opportu-
nity to visit collaborating labs in the no less interesting
cities of Budapest and Berkeley.
Please send a CV and motivation letter including
references to Vincent Daubin (vincent.daubin@univ-
lyon1.fr) and Bastien Boussau (bastien.boussau@univ-

EvolutionaryGenetics
Three postdoc positions for studying the genomics of
de novo gene evolution
Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen,
Germany
Department of Evolutionary Genetics
Group of Diethard Tautz
http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/15929/-
evolutionarygenetics Funded by an ERC advanced
grant, we will start a large scale project for under-
standing patterns and processes of de novo evolution
of genes.
There is rapidly accumulating evidence that new gene
functions can evolve out of non-coding DNA and thatthis contributes to evolutionary innovations (see Tautz
and Domazet-Loso, The evolutionary origin of orphan
genes, Nature Reviews Genetics 12, 692-702). We will
follow three major lines of research to investigate this
in depth:
1. comparative genomics in the house mouse (genus
Mus) species group and outgroups, involving RNASeq
and genome sequencing to systematically identify genes
with a recent history of de novo evolution
2. use an experimental evolution approach in bacte-
ria/phages to assess the frequency of emergence of func-
tional peptides out of random sequences
3. functional analysis of de novo evolved mouse genes
through knockout studies
Qualications required:
position 1: experience in comparative genomics and
bioinformatics
position 2: experience in bacterial/phage genetics and
genomics
position 3: experience in mouse genetics
Candidates should have a completed PhD in the respec-
tive elds. Employment is for initially two years, but
can be extended for up to ve years with the option to
develop an own research agenda in the eld. Payment
will be at the TV oD13 scale with full social benets.
Applications should be sent to tautz@evolbio.mpg.de
and include a complete CV, publication list, letter of
motivation and contact information for up to three ref-
erences.

MaxPlanck Tuebingen Sticklebacks
Postdoctoral positions are available in the new lab of
Dr Felicity Jones at the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory
of Max Planck Society, Tuebingen, Germany.
Threespine stickleback sh have recently emerged to
be an excellent evolutionary model organism (Jones et
al Nature; Chan et al 2010 Science). In the Jones94 EvolDir February 1, 2013
Lab we are launching a comprehensive research pro-
gram to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms
underlying adaptive divergence and speciation. We
have previously identied at kilobase resolution a set
of loci underlying repeated divergence between ma-
rine and freshwater stickleback species-pairs (Jones et
al 2012 Nature). These loci are predominantly non-
coding and fall within regions of low recombination
rate (including inversions), suggesting both regulatory
changes and the recombination landscape are impor-
tant in adaptive evolution and speciation. Using trans-
genics gain-of-function assays via Tol2 transposon, and
loss-of-function via zinc-nger nuclease/TALEN we aim
to functionally dissect speciation loci to determine how
regulatory evolution aects phenotype, tness and con-
tributes to adaptive divergence. We will also investigate
molecular mechanisms that shape recombination land-
scape and hotspots across the genome and how this
contributes to the maintenance of adaptive suites of
loci (\supergenes") in contact zones between divergent
species. We will continue to expand our rich dataset of
whole genome sequencing, expression analysis and ge-
netic mapping to identify the molecular basis of repro-
ductive isolation between replicate stickleback species-
pairs.
We seek highly motivated Postdoc applicants with ex-
perience in molecular genetics, transgenics, develop-
mental, quantitative, computational biology and/or
population genomics.
The FML is located on the Max Planck Campus in Tue-
bingen and oers an international environment, with
English as the working language. We are part of a
dynamic and interactive group of labs researching var-
ious aspects of adaptation and evolutionary genetics,
with the aim of linking molecular changes to organismal
phenotypes. These include the Chan Lab (genetics of
adaptation in mice), Jekely Lab (neurobiology and be-
havior of marine zooplankton), the Weigel Lab (adap-
tive genetic variation in arabidopsis and guppy sh),
the Sommer group (evolutionary genomics of free-living
nematodes), Krause group (evolutionary genetics and
ancient DNA - University of Tuebingen). Tuebingen
boasts one of Germany's top universities and a vibrant
cultural life with easy connections to major European
cities.

IntraspecicDivergenceInPasserines
The postdoctoral fellow will work on the project \The
early stages of the speciation process - prezygotic re-
productive isolation and diversication in passerines",
funded by the Research Council of Norway and NHM.
Speciation is a fundamental evolutionary process in
which lineages diverge to form new species. Under-
standing speciation processes is essential for under-
standing the evolution of biodiversity. Sexual selection
may play a role in speciation processes, e.g. by promot-
ing evolution of secondary sexual traits and preferences
in allopatry, leading to divergence and premating iso-
lation upon secondary contact. However, if sexual or-February 1, 2013 EvolDir 97
naments do not diverge in allopatry, populations may
evolve deep genetic divergence but still despeciate upon
secondary contact. The postdoctoral fellow will investi-
gate cases of deep sympatric intraspecic divergences in
two passerine species (common redstart and raven), us-
ing multilocus coalescence-based analyses, and explore
several hypotheses for how such deep divergences have
evolved. The project will require the use of a variety of
analytical tools, like modern molecular genetic analy-
ses, population genetics and coalescence analyses, and
comparative statistics. The project will include com-
prehensive eld work, both in Europe, Asia and North
America.
The project team will consist of two postdocs and one
eld/lab technician and two senior NHM scientists: As-
sociate professor Arild Johnsen (project leader) and

Scientic description Great diet exibility and manipu-
lation abilities allow primates to be more resilient than
many other animals to uctuations in climate and food
availability. Primate food choice is complex and de-
pends on dierent factors such as the nutritional qual-
ity of the available food, and the nutritional needs and
health status of the individuals. Moreover, in great apes
cultural dierences seem to explain part of the feed-
ing variation, but this is still debated as many consider
culture to be a uniquely a human trait. Particularly,
feeding techniques, which vary across dierent popu-
lations of chimpanzees and orang-utans, have been de-ned as cultural traits similarly to human societies who
live in the same environment and have the same tools
but show dierent cultural choices. Whether feeding
traditions and culture exist in all species of great apes
and how they are transmitted between generations is
still an open question. Little is known on the elusive
and endangered western gorillas. Yet, they appear to
rely on dierent learning mechanisms in relation to the
use of toxic plants in comparison to wild chimpanzees.
The proposed research will shed light on feeding tra-
ditions and functional capacities of western gorillas at
dierent levels: inter-species, inter-groups, inter and
intra-individuals. This research aims at investigating:
1) the existence of 'cultural' traditions in gorilla food
choice that are independent from food availability, 2) if
the intra and inter-specic dierences (in comparison to
existing data on other primates, including humans) in
food processing and manipulation techniques (includ-
ing manual preferences) are linked to feeding traditions
and/or morphological variability respectively, and 3)
the behavioural mechanisms involved in the transmis-
sion of feeding information (food choice and processing)
during learning. The candidate is expected to have pre-
vious eld experience (preferably with gorillas) and will
be working under natural conditions in West Africa.

expansions, migration, admixture) using such kind of
data. Finally these new tools and methods will be ap-
plied to human population genetics data already gener-
ated in the lab or available from public databases. Sev-
eral major questions will be investigated, for instance:
What is the impact of lifestyle (e.g. sedentary farm-

on the demography of human populations? How can
we infer complex admixture processes among human
populations from genome wide data?100 EvolDir February 1, 2013

PhD or Postdoctoral Fellow Opportunity: Genomic re-
search on contemporary evolution in natural popula-

sures. Infectious diseases are critically important in
species adaptation, evolution, and persistence. How-
ever, climatic changes are altering disease dynamics in
northern species by promoting the invasion of novel dis-
eases and disease vectors. The capacity of northern
species to adapt to these rapid changes is largely un-
clear, thereby threatening their persistence. One ap-
proach for understanding adaptation to disease is to
examine the correlation between the geographic distri-
bution of host immunogenetic variation and of disease
variants relative to demographic parameters such as
gene ow that also inuence the distribution of adaptive

UArizona ProteinEvolvability
A postdoc position is available to work with Joanna
Masel (http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at
the University of Arizona in Tucson.
The conventional view is that new proteins evolve from
old proteins via gene duplication and divergence. How-
ever, this poses a chicken-and-egg problem, implying
an ancient \big bang" of protein creation. This project
focuses instead on the ongoing de novo evolution of
protein-coding genes from previously non-coding se-
quences. The postdoc will investigate both case stud-
ies of this phenomena, and computational predictors of
biochemical properties that might facilitate such con-
versions over evolutionary timescales.
The Masel group's main research interests are in ro-
bustness and evolvability, using a mixture of analyt-
ical theory, bioinformatic and simulation approaches.
This work is primarily bioinformatic, but opportuni-
ties for related, more theoretical projects also exist.
Experimental collaborations with structural biologist
Matthew Cordes, also at the University of Arizona, are
possible too.
Excellent computer programming skills are essential,
with bioinformatics / genomics experience strongly pre-
ferred. Experience with (or at least prior interest
in) evolutionary biology, protein structure and folding,
statistics and other quantitative approaches are all ad-
vantages. A start date of August 2013 is preferred but
negotiable, and the position is renewable, with funding
secured for three years.

Butteries evolve mimetic wing coloration under selec-February 1, 2013 EvolDir 107
tion from predators. Unless buttery eyes have adapta-
tions for discriminating mimetic color variation there is
a risk of confusing mimics from potential mates for the
butteries themselves. The genus Heliconius, composed
of 43 species, is of particular interest because unpalat-
able species form M ullerian mimicry rings throughout
the Neotropics. We have discovered that Heliconius
eyes express recently duplicated ultraviolet (UV) opsin
mRNAs, and provided evidence that this gene dupli-
cation may be an adaptation for species recognition of
mimetic colors, via enhanced UV color vision. This
project aims to characterize the visual transcriptome
across the Heliconius phylogeny and in related outgroup
taxa using RNA-sequencing of adult compound eyes to
identify gene networks involved in the evolution of novel
photoreceptors and sexual dimorphisms in eye morphol-
ogy and visual function.
We are seeking a Postdoctoral Research Associate
with expertise in bioinformatics, comparative genomics,
molecular evolution and/or in qPCR and in preparation
of libraries for Next-Generation sequencing to comple-

EvolHumanGeneRegulation
Two postdoc positions are available at the department
of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, to
work with Yoav Gilad and Jonathan Pritchard.
One of the main challenges for geneticists in the 'post-
genome' era is to understand the genetic architecture of
gene regulation and how dierences in gene regulation
aect complex phenotypes, including human diseases.
By collecting valuable samples, developing and adapt-
ing new technologies, and combining expertise in evo-
lutionary biology, comparative genetics, and genomics,
our groups have made key contributions to the study of
gene regulation in humans and closely related primates.
Over the past year, we have started to develop induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) systems for many of our
projects. We realized that in order to gain additional
insight into regulatory processes that underlie variation
in complex phenotypes we must have access to faith-
ful model systems of a wide range of cell types. We
are currently working on the a number of iPSC-related
projects, including a project aimed at understanding
genetic determinants of regulatory variation in dier-
entiated cells, a comparative genomics study of dier-
entiation in primates using iPSCs, and a study aimed
at using iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study the ge-
netic basis for CVD.t
The open postdoc positions are not targeted to spe-
cic projects; postdocs are expected to choose a project
based on their interest. Both empirical and computa-
tional biologists are encouraged to apply.
If interested, please email a cover letter outlining your
research experience and interests, a curriculum vitaeand contact information for 3 referees to Yoav Gilad at

EvolutionMicrobialCommunities
Two Postdoctoral Researcher Positions on \Engineer-

production"
Understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynam-
ics in complex microbial communities and harnessing
this understanding in engineering synthetic communi-
ties is a big challenge. We are aiming to face this
challenge by studying microbial communities involved
in biomethane production. In a two tiered approach,
we will employ directed evolution on microbial com-
munities and implement simple synthetic communities
in the lab. To focus on these two complementary ap-
proaches, we are looking to recruit two postdoctoral re-
searchers that can work in collaborative manner. One
post will focus on mathematical modelling of simple
\synthetic" communities and their experimental imple-
mentation (with the support of a technician). The other
post will focus on establishing and running of directed
evolution experiments on natural microbial communi-
ties isolated from natural sources and bioreactors. This
work will aso be supported by an independent techni-
cian. The work on synthetic communitiy modeling and
implementation will be conducted under the supervi-
sion of Orkun Soyer (University of Exeter, Stratheam
campus), while that on experimental evolution will be
conducted under the supervision of Angus Buckling
(University of Exeter, Cornwall campus).
The successful candidates will be part of a larger

UFlorida SeasonalAdaptation
Postdoc: U. Florida - mechanisms of seasonal adapta-
tion and life history evolution.
A postdoctoral position in genomics and physiology of
seasonal adaptation, life history evolution, and specia-
tion is available in Dan Hahns lab at the University of
Florida.
Our work takes a vertically integrated approach to un-
derstanding how rapid adaptation of insect seasonal life
history timing can lead to speciation and radiation onto
new host plants in the apple maggot sympatric specia-
tion system. Specically, a new host race of Rhagoletis
pomonella formed when this y radiated from its native
host plant, hawthorns, onto domesticated apples. Be-
cause apples ower and fruit earlier in the summer than
hawthorns and adult ies are short lived the two host
races have become isolated in time. In this system tem-
poral isolation of the two host races is driven by shifts in
the timing of pupal diapause/dormancy wherein the ap-
ple host race enters diapause earlier than the hawthorn
host race and also exits diapause earlier the next year
to synchronize themselves with their novel host fruit.
Thus, this system is not only a model for speciation
and host plant adaptation, but also for adaptation to
shifts in seasonal timing like those expected to occur
with shifts in seasonality due to anthropogenic climate
change.

This project is a collaborative eort with Greg Ragland,
Scott Egan, and Je Feder at the University of Notre
Dame and the successful applicant will be part of a
larger team at both U. Florida and Notre Dame. The
postdoc will be expected to lead a group of undergrad-
uate and graduate students in eld collecting ies from
both host plants, rearing them in the lab under dierent
thermal regimes mimicking seasonal shifts, phenotyping
dormancy using metabolic rates, and collecting staged
tissue samples for RNA-seq, proteomics, and whole-
genome associations. The postdoc will be expected to
process, analyze, and integrate high-throughput data
from next-generation sequencing and mass spectrom-
etry and apply the results to a physiologically in-
formed framework for the evolution of life history tim-
ing. Experience with high-dimensionality data, ge-
nomics, molecular evolution, and programming in R
and Perl/Python are all a plus.
The initial appointment will be for 2 years starting in
summer 2013, with extension for up to 4 years based
on performance. The University of Florida located in
Gainesville oers a rich scientic community for evo-
lution, ecology, physiology/cell biology, and genomics
that spans many departments including Entomology
and Nematology (the academic home for this appoint-
ment), Biology, Wildlife, Forestry, the Genomics In-
stitute, the US Department of Agriculture, and the
College of Medicine. There will be substantial op-
portunities for interdisciplinary training across these
units, including training in genomics and informatics,
as well as additional training opportunities in teach-
ing/instruction and scientic outreach to the public.
Gainesville is a great college town in north Florida sur-

6 months position as young researcher in population
genomics of speciation
The Centre for Marine Evolutionary Biology, Faculty of
Science, University of Gothenburg Centre for Marine
Evolutionary Biology (www.cemeb.science.gu.se) is a
Swedish centre of excellence linking research in theoret-
ical biology, population genetics, ecological genomics,
developmental biology, physiology and ecology. About
50 researchers, postdocs and PhD students work jointly
in the programme. CeMEB is funded by the Swedish
Science Research Councils (VR and Formas) and the
University of Gothenburg during the period 2008-2018.
During the year 2013 the Centre will host Professor
Roger Butlin, University of Sheeld, as guest professor.
Professor Butlin is an authority in research on hybrid
zones and speciation. We now seek a dedicated young
researcher with a PhD degree in the eld of popula-
tion genetics/genomics/bioinformatics to be appointed
at CeMEB as a young researcher during 6 months to
work closely with Professor Butlin and in collaboration
with the CeMEB community.
During his time in Sweden, Professor Butlin will work
on local adaptation and the evolution of reproductive
isolation in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis. The
project will make extensive use of data from NGS se-
quencing, including a new study on hybrid zones be-
tween Swedish ecotypes and analysis of existing sRAD
and RNAseq data to study genomic dierentiation
across abrupt environmental boundaries. The de novo
genome sequencing of Littorina saxatilis is currently
nearing completion by the CeMEB consortium. Pro-
fessor Butlin will work jointly with the CeMEB com-
munity in assembling and annotating the genome, as
well as combining the genome assembly with a genetic
map using sRAD markers. There may also be an oppor-
tunity to work with Professor Butlin on a pilot project,
probably with a dierent model organism, aimed at de-
tecting the very rst steps in the evolution of reproduc-
tive isolation.
Qualications
The successful applicant should have a PhD in evo-lutionary genetics, or a related discipline, and either
previous experience of working with analyses of high-
throughput sequencing data in an evolutionary con-

Industrial melanism in the peppered moth: recent and
ancient sweeps

date: March 2013 (possibly later) Salary: $31,020-
$33,884 pa
Industrial melanism in the peppered moth (Biston be-
tularia) is the iconic example of rapid adaptation to
environmental change. Large changes in the frequency
of melanism (a dominant trait controlled by allelic vari-
ation at a single locus) have been observed in Britain,
continental Europe and North America. Preliminary
data suggest that melanism in these populations has
arisen from separate mutations. This project aims to
characterise extended haplotypes around the melanism
locus in contemporary and historical (museum) samples
from all three populations to make inferences about the
strength of selection and consequences for linked varia-
tion, gene ow, as well as the age of morph alleles. The
results will add an entirely new dimension to the body
of work on this important system, providing insight into
the mechanism of recurrent or parallel evolution, and
the dynamics of selective sweeps.We are seeking a PDRA with expertise in computa-
tional population genetics, statistics and informatics
to complement the existing core research team at the
University of Liverpool Institute of Integrative Biology
(Ilik Saccheri, Arjen van't Hof, and research technician)
and external collaborators, Fran cois Rousset (Montpel-

Cook (Manchester Museum). Some involvement with
sample collecting in continental Europe and USA will
also be necessary.

development, molecular biology, ecology and evolution
of multicellular hosts and their associated microbiota.
The center comprises a highly interactive set of lab-
oratories from diverse areas such as biology, physics,
chemistry, computer science, and mathematics.
The core empirical systems used in the center are ze-
brash and threespine stickleback sh. The research
environment for these well developed teleost models is
particularly strong at the University of Oregon. In ad-
dition, the recent development of gnotobiotic micro-
biological approaches in zebrash and stickleback at
UO make this a very powerful pairing for manipulative
studies of host-microbe interactions.
Several of us are particularly interested in applicants
who would like to better understand host-microbe sys-
tems by formulating novel co-evolutionary theory from
rst principles, or by developing new analytical ap-
proaches and tools for massively large genomic data

SEARCH FELLOW (SKO 1352) IN DISEASE ECOL-
OGY is available at the Centre for Ecological and
Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES), Department of Bio-
sciences, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences,
University of Oslo.
The Post Doctoral fellow will be part of the project
\Climate Changes and Zoonotic Epidemiology in
Wildlife Systems" (ZEWS) funded by the Norwegian
Research Council as part of the NORKLIMA Program.
The position is tentatively available from April 1st
2013.
Within the framework of the position duties may be
assigned. No one can be appointed for more than one
specied period at the same institution.
Please go to http://uio.easycruit.com/vacancy/-
904757/96323?iso=no to apply for the position.
Project description
Among the most serious eects of climate change is its
capacity to drastically alter the ecology of diseases that
are vectors-borne, have wildlife and/or environmentalreservoirs (WVE diseases). Theory and observation
suggest that disease outbreaks can result from gradual
changes in transmission, susceptibility, host or vector
density, resulting in tipping points where epidemiolog-
ical characteristics suddenly change. The understand-
ing required to plan and implement mitigation strate-
gies for WVE diseases requires broad interdisciplinary
collaborations to provide: - Integration and overview
of research on WVE diseases likely to respond to cli-
mate change - New data where critical information is
found to be missing - Improved risk models taking dif-
ferent scenarios into account To make the most of lim-
ited resources, we use three systems that are impor-
tant in their own right while being complementary as
model systems: Lyme disease, anthrax and tularemia.
They are chosen for being; (a) currently or poten-
tially important in Scandinavia, (b) likely to respond
strongly to climate change, and (c) giving complemen-
tary perspectives on how WVE diseases responds to
climate change. The project is led by a national Centre
of Excellence; Center for Ecological and Evolutionary
Synthesis (CEES) and performed in collaboration with
prominent members of the international medical, biose-
curity, veterinary medicine, climatological and public
health communities.
Qualications
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has
a strategic ambition of being a leading research faculty.
Candidates for these fellowships will be selected in ac-
cordance with this, and expected to be in the upper
segment of their class with respect to academic creden-
tials.
The candidate must have completed a PhD or other cor-
responding education equivalent to a Norwegian doc-
toral degree in evolutionary ecology. The project will
call for a strong background in ecological and evolution-
ary theory, and it necessitates both practical experience
in doing research on class A environmental pathogens
in the eld as well as in a BSL3 laboratory and a very
strong background in statistical modeling of popula-
tion dynamics, evolution and epidemiology, preferably
on zoonotic disease systems. The announced position
involves development of new theoretical predictions to
investigate current and future patterns of disease distri-
bution, prevalence and evolution. A solid background
in mathematics and strong computational and model-
ing skills are thus essential. Excellent knowledge of at
least one programming language (e.g. Matlab and/or
R) and knowledge of statistical and GIS software is re-
quired. Applicants must possess sound knowledge of
dierent modeling approaches in environmental disease
biology and should have a successful track record of ap-
plying these skills. The candidate must also be employ-February 1, 2013 EvolDir 119

(DEPE). The DEPE is France's largest eco-physiology
lab which also hosts one of the most important French
research groups on cognition http://www.iphc.cnrs.fr/-
-Strategie-scientique,90- .html. The DEPE oers a
privileged environment for exchanging on broad ques-
tions in ecology, animal behavior, cognition, evolution
and eco- physiology, studying vertebrate species living
in extreme environments.
Research topic: http://www.usias.fr/en/eco-
physiology-of-cognition/ Increased environmental
stress due to anthropologically induced climate change
might impair cognitive abilities of free ranging animals.
Students of cognition typically have little experience
of physiology while students of physiology typically do
not consider cognition. Therefore we will investigate
how cognitive tasks (attention, spatial memory) in free
ranging animals are inuenced by their physiological
state. The postdoc is expected to work in the new eld
of eco-physiology of cognition and to:
1. Establish cognitive tests for striped mice in the lab-
oratory.
2. Study how cognitive abilities in free ranging striped
mice are inuenced by their physiological status, both
correlational and by experimentally altering the physi-
ological status.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE
BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS
Full time, 3 years xed term
Closing date for applications: 25 January 2013
Start date: 1 March 2013
A full-time, NERC-funded, 3-year postdoctoral re-
search position is available to join a research team in
the School of Life Sciences at the University of Sus-
sex, UK. The programme of research is led by Prof
Jeremy Field. The main aim of the project is to under-
stand helping decisions in primitively eusocial insects,
using paper wasp (Polistes) cofoundresses as a model
system. In particular, to investigate the role of part-
ner choice, conict and market forces in the process of
cofoundress group formation itself. Results should pro-
vide the most comprehensive understanding of group
formation to date in a primitively eusocial insect, and
will allow a critical evaluation of previous models and
data.
The project will involve a combination of eld exper-
iments, and genetic work using microsatellite markers
that are already available. The successful applicant will
spend 3-5 months each year conducting eldwork at an
established site in southern Spain, with other members
of the research group. There will be a technician work-ing on the project who will carry out most of the molec-
ular work.
The successful applicant will have a PhD in be-
havioural/evolutionary biology. Experience with ani-
mal social systems, and experience of eldwork, molec-
ular techniques and statistical analysis using 'R' or sim-
ilar programs would be useful, but it is not necessary to
have experience in all of these areas. An ability to speak
Spanish, or willingness to learn some basic Spanish, is
desirable. A driving licence is essential.
The Evolution, Behaviour and Environment (EBE)
Subject Group in the School of Life Sciences at Sus-
sex (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/ebe/research) is a
thriving research environment providing ample oppor-
tunities to interact with leading senior researchers and
their groups. The successful applicant will particu-
larly benet from an exceptional concentration of re-
search expertise that focusses on social evolution in
insects. Jeremy Field, Francis Ratnieks, Bill Hughes,
Dave Goulson (joining Sussex in April 2013), Tom Col-
lett and Paul Graham all lead well-established research
groups. Our seminar series have a correspondingly
strong (though by no means exclusive) focus on social
evolution.

UppsalaU EvolutionMulticellularity
* Postdoc position '**Multilevel selection in lamen-
tous fungi: a clue to the evolution of multicellularity**'
at Uppsala University, Sweden*
A fully-funded 1-year postdoctoral research position
(with the high probability for a second year) is cur-
rently available at the Department of Evolutionary Bi-
ology, Uppsala University, Sweden.
The theory of evolution by natural selection is one of
the cornerstones in modern biology. There is, however,
considerable debate about which entities (ranging from
genes, cells and individuals, to populations, species and
species groups) are the units of selection. Natural se-
lection acting at dierent levels is expected to drive the
aggregation of smaller independent units to form new,
more complex, layers of biological organization. For
example, this process is expected to have driven the
evolution of multicellularity, whereby the interactionFebruary 1, 2013 EvolDir 125
between genes and cells resulted in a tness increase
in multicellular organisms compared to unicellular or-
ganisms. This post-doc project involves the study of
multilevel selection in lamentous ascomycetes. These
organisms may be considered intermediates between
unicellular and multicellular organisms because of their
totipotent and free ranging heterogeneous nuclei within
a mycelium, all of which contributes to the phenotype
of the mycelium. The candidate will perform arti-
cial selection experiments combined with genomics and
transcriptomics of the model system /Neurospora /to
investigate whether the mycelium represents a case of
cooperation or conict between the haploid nuclei it
contains. Under the scenario of cooperation we expect
to observe inter-nucleus dynamics that are typical of
those observed within diploid nuclei, such as sheltering
of /de novo/ deleterious mutations and dosage compen-
sation, and the combination of adaptive mutations of
the heterogeneous nuclei should be benecial for the
mycelium. A next step is to test for kin selection by
investigating the outcome of interactions between nu-
clei exhibiting dierent degrees of relatedness. On the
other hand, under the conict scenario, heterogeneous
mycelia would be at a tness disadvantage due to an-
tagonism among nuclei. The results of the evolutionary
interactions occurring at subcellular and higher levels
emerging from this project have the potential to con-
tribute signicantly to our understanding of one of the
major evolutionary transitions - the evolution of multi-
cellularity.
Applicants should have a PhD in biology/ecology and
a strong interest in biology and evolution. Experi-
ence in experimental lab skills as well as some knowl-
edge in bioinformatics are advantageous. Mathemati-
cal skills and an interest to develop theoretical mod-
els are welcome but entirely optional. The candi-
date will join the research group of Simone Imm-
ler (see http://www.ebc.uu.se/forskning/IEG/evbiol/-
forskning/Immler/) located at EBC. The current re-
search focus of the Immler lab lies on the evolu-
tionary consequences of sex, in particular the evo-
lution of gametes and the consequences of dier-
ential selection between the haploid and diploid
phases of the eukaryotic life cycle using experi-
mental and mathematical tools. This project will
be in close collaboration with the group of Hanna
Johannesson, (http://www.ebc.uu.se/forskning/IEG/-

cated at EBC. The Johannesson lab has its research
focus on the evolution of mating systems and the un-

is announced in combination with a PhD position on
sexual dimorphism, and there are ample opportunitiesto work closely with postdocs and PhD students in
the Immler and Johannesson lab that focus on related

Dear Colleagues,
We are organizing a summer school on Quantitative
Population Genetics this July in Cargese, Corsica,
France. Please help us reach interested participants (at
any level) by forwarding this message and poster.
Dates: 8-20 July, 2013

limited number of fellowships will be available.
The basic laws of evolution are simple: mutations gen-
erate variation, while genetic drift, recombination, and
selection change the frequencies of the variants. Yet
it is surprisingly dicult to predict how these eects
combine to determine how a population will evolve, or
to use our observations of genetic variation in nature
to infer how evolution has acted in the past. This
summer school will give students, postdocs, and re-
searchers in quantitative disciplines (physics, applied
math, computer science, population genetics, statistics,
and computational and systems biology) an overview of
the challenges in the eld, and introduce them to cur-
rent analytical, computational, and experimental meth-
ods of addressing the open questions.

HCMR Greece Metabarcoding
May13-17
2ND DNA METABARCODING SPRING SCHOOL IN
CRETE, GREECE (13-17 MAY 2013)
In the context of the European project MARBIGEN,
the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and
Aquaculture (former Institute of Marine Biology and
Genetics) of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research,
organizes the 2nd DNA Metabarcoding Spring School
in Crete, Greece.
The advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have revolutionized many elds of the bi-
ological sciences, including that of biodiversity studies.
Many ecological questions rely on the knowledge of the
list of species involved in the studied process. Tack-
ling this demand using standard methods of taxonom-
ical identication, is often a dicult task that relies
on highly qualied persons. DNA barcoding has intro-
duced the use of short standardized genomic sequences
(barcode) as a character in taxonomical identication.
DNA metabarcoding uses the same principle that asso-
ciates DNA sequences to taxa for estimating biodiver-
sity of an environmental sample. Metabarcoding ap-
proaches use total and usually degraded DNA from en-
vironmental samples to analyze biotic assemblages and
can be potentially carried out for any kind of organ-
isms in an ecosystem. These analyses rely on specic
genetic markers, called metabarcodes, which should be
optimized for taxonomic resolution, minimal bias in
amplication of the target organism group and short
sequence length. As all living organisms spread cells in
their environment, a PCR amplicon obtained with ad-
equate primers from the total DNA extracted from an
environmental sample, can be consider as a mirror of
the biodiversity present in the environment. The perti-
nent choice of the primer pair allows to focus on a spe-
cic group as, for example, plants. Then the sequencing
of a large number of individual DNA molecules of the
PCR amplicon using NGS technologies allows establish-
ing a list of taxa present in the sample. Metabarcoding
can be applied to many ecological studies such as plant
community analysis, plankton and benthic community
analysis, past ecosystem reconstruction, or diet assess-
ment.
After the success of the 1st DNA Metabarcoding Spring
School in French Alps, we organize the 2nd one in Crete,which includes lectures and bioinformatic practical ses-
sions on metabarcoding. The School is open for 20 par-
ticipants (post-graduate students or researchers) that
will attend both lectures and practicals, and for 30 ad-
ditional participants that will follow only the lectures.
The focus will be mainly on marine biodiversity, how-
ever people from all elds of metabarcoding are encour-
aged to participate.

LinkingPhenotypeDevelopment
Jun10-21
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce a new course \Plant Mor-
phology: Linking Phenotype to Development," June
10-21, 2013, at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard Uni-
versity.
With the opportunity to bring molecular genetic and
genomic tools to almost any clade of plants, a key
challenge will be to link comparative developmental
genetics to existing bodies of knowledge; notably the
two hundred year legacy of comparative developmental
morphology. This integration is critical as the phyloge-
netic, structural, and ecological breadth of plant taxa
open to study expands, and the sophistication of poten-
tial questions increases in complexity. This course will
provide vital analytical tools central to understanding
the developmental bases for structural and functional
diversity. Summer courses in organismic plant biology
at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University bring
world-class faculty and a world-class living collection
together to enable students from around the world to
know the phenotype.
\Plant Morphology: Linking Phenotype to Develop-
ment," an intensive two-week laboratory and lecture
course for advanced undergraduates, graduate students,
and postdoctoral fellows will cover the fundamental
principles of plant form, focusing on developmental dy-
namics, evolutionary diversication, and ecological and
physiological function. Students will be presented with
the conceptual and analytical tools necessary to inter-
pret the vast array of morphologies that exist among
plants. Professors Pamela Diggle (University of Col-
orado) and Peter Endress (University of Zurich) will
serve as the instructors. This course is limited to 12
students.
Costs: meals and dormitory lodging will be provided
for all participants and each student will receive a travel
stipend of up to $500

COURSE OBJECTIVES. - ANT COURSE is designed
for systematists, ecologists, behaviorists, conservation
biologists, and other biologists whose research requires
a greater understanding of ant taxonomy and eld tech-
niques. In 2013, emphasis is on the identication of
the ant genera and species occurring in the Neotrop-
ics. Lectures will include background information on
the ecology, life histories and evolution of ants. Field
trips emphasize collecting and sampling techniques, and
associated lab work focuses specimen preparation, sort-
ing and labeling. Information on equipment, literature,
and myrmecological contacts are also presented.
COURSE SIGNIFICANCE. - Ant Course is a unique
opportunity to acquire training that is unavailable else-
where. This course will provide students with 1) the
condence and skills to identify Neotropical ant gen-
era; 2) an understanding of modern specimen process-
ing and curation techniques; 3) an appreciation for the
biological diversity of ants; and 4) experience keying to
the species level.
SPONSORED BY. - California Academy of Sciences
and The Arthur Lawrence Green Memorial Fund, Mu-
seum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University
LOCATION. - ANT COURSE will be based at the Villa
Carmen Biological Station run by Amazon Conserva-
tion Association. The station is adjacent to Manu Bio-
sphere Reserve, Peru and includes lowland and moun-
tain rainforest from 520 - 1200 m. The course will be
the rst exploration of ants at the station and vicinity.
PARTICIPANT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. - ANT
COURSE is open to all interested individuals, includ-
ing students, professors and motivated amateurs (citi-
zen scientists). Priority will be given to those students
for whom the course will have a signicant impact on
their research with ants. We aim to include students
with a diverse interest in biology, including ant system-
atics, ecology, behavioral biology, genetics, and conser-
vation. An entomological background is not required.
The high instructor to student ratio will allow students
to receive individual attention. Though many of the
instructors speak Spanish, ANT COURSE is presented
in English and limited to 30 participants
COSTS. - Course fees for the 10-day COURSE are $975
for current students (undergraduate and graduate) and
$1275 for non-students (postdocs and professionals).

Evolutionary Biology Workshop in the Alps
Swiss Alps, 18-24 June 2013
3 ETSC credit points
Faculty: Spencer Barrett (University of Toronto) Mark
Kirkpatrick (University of Texas, Austin) John Pannell
(University of Lausanne) Tadeusz Kawecki (University
of Lausanne)
Target participants: PhD students, advanced Masterstudents
This workshop, based on a concept developed by
Stephen Stearns and John Maynard Smith.
The main goals of this course are to develop the follow-
ing skills: . developing your scientic ideas through dis-
cussions in groups; . thinking critically and expressing
oneself clearly; . turning a general idea into a research
project; . writing a research proposal and defending it.
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back seat.
Additionally, the faculty will give talks about their re-
search and be available for informal discussion with in-
dividual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in Villa Cassel (http://-
www.pronatura-aletsch.ch/home-en), at 2000 m of alti-
tude, amid the magnicent mountain landscape of UN-
ESCO World Heritage Site, walking distance from the
largest glacier of the Alps. This isolated site will help
you to concentrate on the course while giving you also
the chance to enjoy the views and the alpine ora.
Costs: CHF 530.- for room and board; there is no tu-
ition fee.
To apply, send a single le (pdf or rtf) con-
taining a short motivation letter, a cv, and the
name of your scientic advisor to Nadia Bruyndon-
ckx<Nadia.Bruyndonckx@unil.ch >, with a Cc to

ULeipzig ProgrammingForEvolu-
tionaryBiology
Course on Programming for Evolutionary Biology
When: April 3rd - 19th 2013
Location: Leipzig, Germany
Application deadline: February 17th 2013
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ 'Nothing
in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolu-
tion' (Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolutionary biology
often involves the analysis of an unprecedented amount
of information and supports many other disciplines,
such as medicine (evolutionary medicine), behavioral
biology (evolutionary psychology), ecology, and in-
formation transfer. Scientists have to analyze large
datasets, which requires computational programming
skills to design and apply own ideas into customized
algorithms.
In this intensive 17 days course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on expe-
rience in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the eld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a fo-
cus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
'learning by doing', which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as nal projects in small
groups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs
of evolutionary biology or related research elds with
no or little programming experience who want to be-
come procient in computational evolutionary biology
in a couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the University of Leipzig.

Application for Genetics of Adaptation 2013
to john.mckay@ebc.uu.seTheoretical Motivation - Since Darwin, understanding
the genetics of adaptation has been a central goal in
evolutionary biology. Despite the long history, there
are many unanswered questions: How many genes un-
derlie adaptation, what are their eect sizes, and are
they consistent with existing theoretical models? For
example, Orr (1998) predicts an exponential distribu-
tion, where the eect size decreases as genotypes ap-
proach an optimal phenotype. A related question is
whether the response to selection is limited by bene-
cial new mutations, or standing genetic variation within
populations Are genetic correlations between traits due
to linkage disequilibrium or pleiotropy?
Revolutionary advances in genomics and bioinformatics
now promise identication of the causal loci underlying
ecological variation. Several longstanding questions in
evolutionary and ecological genetics can only be ad-
dressed by identifying and examining the history of the
actual loci that underlie variation in ecologically impor-
tant traits. For instance, abundant genetic variation
has been described over the last 50 years (both quan-
titative genetic and sequence variation) but we have
historically been unable to distinguish between alter-
natives causing this variation. Is this variation due to
mutation-selection balance, where variation is due to
new mutations that have yet to be eliminated by se-
lection or balancing selection, where variation is main-
tained over long periods of time by uctuating selection
pressure?

positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only

old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected

Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
