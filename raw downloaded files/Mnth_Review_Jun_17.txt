Plants and fungi play an important role in healthcare
worldwide, with about 25% of modern prescription drugs
containing at least one compound derived or patterned
after substances derived from owering plants. With an
estimated 350,000 species, angiosperms provide a rich
potential for nding new lead compounds for drug de-
velopment. However, research so far has largely focused
on single species, on only a few metabolites of medicinalJune 1, 2017 EvolDir 5
importance, and/or on specic commercial applications
only, e.g. drugs, colours, aromas, or cosmetics. The aim
of this symposium is to bring together researchers who
are working on plants (and/or fungi), microrganisms
and animals, and are interested in a broader picture of
chemo-biodiversity, phylogenetic relatedness, and a bio-
geographic perspective. We will welcome contributions
shedding light on the distribution of chemodiversity
both across taxonomic and biogeographic scales and on
the predictive power of phylogenies.

GENOMIC BASIS OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION A
symposium hosted by Senckenberg Biodiversity and Cli-
mate Research Centre, Frankfurt, Germany January
17th to 18th 2018 Senckenberg Museum of Natural His-
tory in Frankfurt am Main Senckenberganlage 25 60325
Frankfurt am Main Germany6 EvolDir June 1, 2017
Global warming and changing climatic conditions will
require organisms to either track their climatic niche or
rapidly adapt to new conditions. Our understanding of
the genomic basis underlying climate adaptation across
various taxa is currently growing fast. We have so far
learned about adaptive inversion clines, polygenic traits,
the interplay of standing genetic variation and newly
arising mutations, adaptation in symbiotic systems, and
the role of adaptive introgression between species. These
species-specic responses now raise more general scien-
tic questions: I) Which processes and genomic features
further or hinder adaptation? II) Are common patterns
arising in terms of genes or pathways responding to
climate stress selection? What are the relative roles of
transcription changes versus structural changes? III)
Which directions of research are promising for the fu-
ture? IV) Which next generation sequencing techniques,
and other methods, are most appropriate in the near fu-
ture? This symposium aims at bringing together leading
scientists in the eld to discuss recent results in genomic
climate adaptation. Particularly, we want to integrate
knowledge across disciplines (e.g. population genetics,
molecular ecology/evolution, bioinformatics), and across
taxa (e.g. plants, animals, fungi). Together, we want to
identify open questions and promising methodology, and
conceptually advance this scientically and societally
important eld.

Dear Colleagues,
The eld of population genetics has a remarkable tradi-
tion of being a tight-knit and nurturing community. In
order to continue to foster that sense of community for
popgen groups in the Midwest, *we are organizing the
fourth annual Midwest PopGen conference*.The location and date this year will be Michigan State
University on August 4th-5th. The meeting will begin
Friday at noon and continue to Saturday evening with
a BBQ on Friday evening.
Approximately fteen 25-minute talks will be selected
from submitted abstracts, and there will be a poster
session. The meeting will again be trainee-oriented,
so students and postdocs are especially encouraged to
present their work. There will be prizes awarded for
best poster and best talk by a student and postdoc.
Please RSVP by July 21st by adding your name and
information to the registration list (https://goo.gl/-
wm0dDu). If you would like to give an oral presentation,
submit your abstracts by July 21st to Anna Di Rienzo
<dirienzo at bsd dot uchicago dot edu >. Submitters
will be notied if their abstract is chosen for a talk by
July 1st. Accommodation advice is also provided in a
tab on the registration GoogleSheet ( https://goo.gl/-
wm0dDu). We hope you can make it and that we can
continue this meeting for the population geneticists in
our region!

UGothenburg PhylogenyErrors
Aug15-18
Hi,
As part of the Third BioSyst.EU meeting in Gothen-
burg, Sweden (http://www.conferencemanager.se/-
BiosystEU2017/start.html) from August 15th to 18th
2017 we organise a symposium on the \Identication
and avoidance of sources of error in phylogeny inference"
(http://www.conferencemanager.se/BiosystEU2017/-
identication-and-avoidance-of-sources-of-error-in-
phylogeny-inference-gfbs.html). The symposium
is hosted by the German Society for Biological
Systematics.
DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACT SUBMISSION AND
EARLY BIRD REGISTRATION: MAY 31, 2017
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is a central task of
modern evolutionary biology, in which the assessment
of phylogenetic relationships provides the foundation
for the interpretation of comparative and evolutionary
biological data. Molecular data for phylogenetic tree
inference has increased from single gene analyses of few
taxa to phylogenomic analyses comprising hundreds of
genes and taxa. Due to the exponential growth of molec-
ular data along with reduced stochastic sampling errors,
the goal of approximating the \Tree of Life" seems to
be more attainable today than ever. However, although
substantial progress has already been achieved in re-
spect of certain relationships within the \Tree of Life",several phylogenetic questions still remain unresolved.
Therefore, the phylogenomic era appears also to be the
beginning of an era of strong incongruence due to the fur-
ther accumulation of data aected by systematic biases.
These biases might arise from rate or compositional
heterogeneity, missing data or model misspecications.
In such cases, phylogenetic methods may be inconsis-
tent due to their inability to suciently account for the
evolutionary complexity of genomic data. The conse-
quence is strongly supported, but incorrectly resolved
phylogenetic trees.
In this symposium we want to discuss various reasons
of systematic bias and introduce new algorithms, which
enable more reliable reconstructions of large-scale phy-
logenetic trees or, equally important, will indicate when
reliable inferences are not possible given the currently
available data (e.g. the eect of incomplete lineage sort-
ing and recombination to phylogenetic reconstruction).
Topics are discussed. Thereby, we put a special emphasis
on the potential and possible pitfalls of recent supertree,
coalescence, and supermatrix approaches. The two in-
vited and renowned keynote speakers, John Gatesy and
Mark Wilkinson, address their points of view concerning
these methodologies. The titles of their talks are:
John Gatesy (Institute for Comparative Genomics &
University of California Riverside): A single outlier gene
tree can overturn hundreds of perfectly congruent gene
trees in phylogenetic coalescence analyses Mark Wilkin-
son (Natural History Museum London): Supertrees,
supermatrices and pluralism in phylogenenetics (Co-
author will be Peter G. Foster)
However, we are also very interested in contribution by
others. Therefore, if you have a topic tting this venue
in a general sense and not only concerning supertree,
coalescence, and supermatrix debate you are invited
to come to the conference and present your work as a
talk or a poster. We especially invite students at this
conference is a good opportunity to get in contact with
your fellows working on the same subject and show-
cast your work to a diverse and interested international
audience. Presentations from a purely theoretical per-
spective, which can initiate new research in known or
yet unrecognized biases, are also welcome.
The BioSyst website above has detailed information on
registration, submission procedures, symposia and their
speaker as well as travelling and accommodation.
We hope to see you in Gothenburg,
Patrick & Torsten.

3-yr PhD position in ecology, phylogeography and land-
scape genetics
//
/Title/
Incorporating Phylogeographic infOrmation into niche
moDels to improve species re-distribution projections
under climAte waRming and habitat fragmentation: the
Case of forest-dwelling specIes across European agricul-
tural landscapeS[PODARCIS]
//
/Aim/
Climate warming and habitat fragmentation are two
key components of global change that push species to
redistribute or evolve to adapt to the new conditions
(Lenoir & Svenning 2015; Pecl et al. 2017). To hind-
cast and forecast species redistribution under past and
future environmental conditions, respectively, the state-
of-the-art is to use species distribution models (SDMs)
(Guisan & Zimmermann 2000). However, traditional
SDMs assume that individuals from all populations of a
given species respond equally to environmental changes
although genetic dierences among populations interact
with environmental factors such that tness can vary
among populations (Savoleinen et al. 2007; Leimu &
Fischer 2008; Valladares et al. 2014). The most recent
scientic literature on SDMs suggests that incorporat-
ing intraspecic variation into SDMs leads to less pes-
simistic redistribution projections (Pearman et al. 2010;
Oney et al. 2013). Both phylogeography (Guiller &
Madec, 2010; Guiller et al. 2012) and landscape genetics
can provide spatially and temporaly explicit informa-
tion on the genetic structure and dierences among
populations of the same species that could be used
to incorporate intraspecic variation into SDMs and
thus improve redistribution projections under climate
change.This PhD project entitled PODARCIS speci-
cally aims at incorporating intraspecic variationdata
obtained from a union of phylogeography and landscape
genetics (Rissler 2016) into SDMs. PODARCISis part of
the EU (BiodivERsA) project Woodnet and the regional
(Hauts-de-France) project Pegase. Three model species
of European temperate forests will be studied through-
out the PhD prject: the plants /Geum urbanum/ and
/Oxalis //acetosella/characterized by dierent dispersalcapacities as well as the tick /Idoxes ricinus/ considered
as the main vector of the Lyme Borreliosis in West-
ern Europe and thus implying potential public health
hazards. PODARCIS rests on three basic pillars:
i.Phylogeography and historical demography to deter-
mine the phylogeographic structure of each species and
to disentangle the relative impacts of past /versus/ cur-
rent climatic changes in shaping the geographic distri-
butions of genealogical lineages ;
ii.Fundamental ecology to develop SDMs adapted to
each genealogical lineage and to compare these lineage-
specic SDMs to classical SDMs at dierent periods

ANU Australia Pylogenetics
Dear colleagues
I have funds to support two graduate students for fol-
lowing projects:
1. Phylogenetics and next-generation sequencing. The
student will work with next-generation sequencing data,
both real and simulated, to develop phylogenetic meth-
ods for mixtures of DNA samples. 2. Models of micro-
biomes. This project builds on work that we have done
on the evolution of microbiomes (see Zeng et al, PLoS
Comput Biol 11: e1004365). There are many ways to
build on this framework, and the student will have the
freedom to propose his/her own research.
These projects will suit students who have a strong back-
ground in computational biology or equivalent. Students
will enrol at the Research School of Biology of The Aus-
tralian National University, ranked top in Australia and
22 in the world (QS Rankings 2016-17). Doctoral degree
programs in Australia typically last for 3.5 - 4 years. In
addition to excellent colleagues, researchers at the ANU
have access to signicant computational resources { the
University is a partner institution of the National Com-
putational Infrastructure, Australia's high-performance
computing provider.
Please contact me with a brief CV if you are interested.
Thanks in advance.

BangorU PollenBiodiversity
Exploring the ecology of airborne pollen biodiversity
using environmental DA analysis and identifying links
to hay fever
We are advertising for a PhD opportunity to be
hosted in the Molecular Ecology & Fisheries Genetics
Laboratory (MEFGL), at Bangor University (http:/-
/mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/) to commence in October 2017.
The PhD has been made possible via the availabil-
ity of the ERC Industrial Strategy CASE Studentship
scheme and strong links with project partner, the
ational Botanic Garden of Wales. The studentship will
form part of the ERC EVISIO Doctoral Training Pro-
gramme (http://www.envision-dtp.org/), a PhD con-
sortium partnership between Bangor, ottingham and
Lancaster Universities, alongside numerous environmen-
tal bodies, aimed at equipping the next generation of
Environmental Biologists with advanced skills.
Project rationale: In addition to providing benets
to society, biodiversity^ a ealso brings costs. The aerial
biosphere includes ecologically complex^ a emixtures of
pollens that negatively aect human health. Almost a
quarter^ a eof people display allergic reactions to tree
and grass pollen, causing^ a esymptoms ranging from
hay fever to asthma, with associated socio-^ a eeconomic
costs. Identifying tree pollens can be achieved us-
ing microscopy,^ a ebut the process is challenging. ev-
ertheless, since most grass pollens look^ a ethe same, we
need to devise novel ways to identify dierent species
to^ aeunderstand which species of grass contribute to al-
lergies. This studentship^ a ehas three components. The
rst aims to use an environmental DA (eDA) approach
to enhance the way that we assess aerial tree pollen
mixtures. Secondly, to use modelling approaches to
compare and contrast the aerial transit of tree and grass
pollens in relation to biology/ecology and nally, to
identify which species of grass pollen are linked with
hay fever. The PhD will form a distinct component
within a larger ERC funded study \PollerGE" (http://-
pollergen.bangor.ac.uk/) and provide an opportunity
to work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists16 EvolDir June 1, 2017
from a range of UK Universities, the UK Met Of-
ce and the CASE Partner, ational Botanic Garden
of Wales (BGW - home of the Wales Plant DA Bar-
code library). The successful candidate will become
a highly skilled, interdisciplinary graduate working at
the interface between molecular ecology and environ-
mental epidemiology with the potential to make sub-
stantial advances to our understanding of UK ora pol-
lination dynamics and interactions with the allergic
response. Co-supervision will be provided by atasha De-
Vere/Gareth Grith/Mat Hegarty (BGW and Aberyst-
wyth), Carsten Skjth (Worcester), Ben Wheeler/ick Os-
borne (Exeter/Sydney) and the UK Met Oce. Training
will be provided in the main areas of molecular ecology,
genomics, taxonomy, bioinformatics, modelling; mul-
tidisciplinarity skills and epidemiology, complemented
by a host of additional opportunities for postgraduate
development. Fieldwork will occur within the UK, with
opportunities for travel/collaborations in Europe and
Australia.
Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Honours De-
gree at 2:1 level or equivalent in subjects such as Biology,
Environmental or atural Sciences, with a strong motiva-
tion to study eDA biodiversity- environment interactions.
Eligibility requirements and application portal can be
found at http://www.envision-dtp.org . If you are inter-
ested in applying, we would strongly recommend con-
tacting Prof. Simon Creer in the rst instance (http://-
mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/sta/si.php; s.creer@bangor.ac.uk;
Twitter @spideycreer) and he will be on hand to assist
with any questions related to the project, important
information on the application process and life in the
group.
Closing date for applications: 2nd of July 2017 with
interviews predicted to take place between 13th-14th
July and look forward to hearing from you!

of the underlying *Prnp* gene suggest that particular

Outline: This project will involve ancient DNA and
next generation sequencing to explore the genetic di-
versity of deer and other ungulates from the Eemian
interglacial period, ~120,000 years ago. A key aspect
of the study will be the integration of environmental
data (including stable isotope analyses in collaboration
with the British Geological Survey), so that changes in
demography (quantied based on the genetic data), dis-
tribution and diversity can be interpreted in the context
of changing environments, providing predictive inferenceon the future impact of climate change. Ancient DNA
together with coalescent methods provides a window
into the historical demographics of species during pe-
riods of environmental change, and the integration of
stable isotope data permits the more specic tracking of
environmental transitions and the behavioural responses
of herbivore species. Further support provided by the
British Deer Society and British Geological Survey

Title: Integrating the Phylogeographic infOrmation into
niche moDels to improve re-distribution projections of
species facing climAte waRming: the Case of plant
specIes in temperate European forestS [PODARCIS]
Abstract
Climate change and habitat fragmentation are two key
components of global change causing the redistribu-
tion and the evolution of species globally. In response
to anthropogenic pressures and climate warming, var-
ious animal, plant or microbial species show spatial
and temporal variation of their range, change in disper-
sal capacity, phenology, abundance and biotic/abiotic
interactions. However, predictions of changes in poten-
tial distribution are dicult as vulnerability to climate
change is species-specic.
The PhD project is part of the BiodivERsA project
Woodnet and the regional project Pegase. The aim
is to develop, within the framework of global climate
warming, an innovative multiscale approach based on
empirical data sets to (i) describe patterns of diversity,
(ii) identify the evolutionary forces acting on genetic
variation, (iii) predict species distribution for conserva-
tion (threatened species) or prevention (invasive species)June 1, 2017 EvolDir 19
decisions. Three model species of European temperate
forest will be studied: the plants Geum urbanum and
Oxalis acetosella that exhibit contrasted dispersal capac-
ities and niche width, and the tick Idoxes ricinus which
is the main vector of the Lyme Borreliosis in Western
Europe. Three elds structure this integrative study:
i. a phylogeography and historical demography ap-
proach to determine the phylogeographic structure of
each species and disentangle impacts of past versus
current climatic changes in shaping their genetic distri-
bution;
ii. a fundamental ecological approach to estimate poten-
tial distribution areas of species and to model environ-
ments favorable to species populations' persistence. The
aim is to develop Species Distribution Models (SDMs)
adapted to each genetic lineage. These specic lineage
SDMs will be compared to classical SDMs at dierent
periods (Pleistocene and Anthropocene);
iii. a landscape genetic approach for modeling the perme-
ability of landscapes to species individuals' movement.
From each lineage-specic SDM obtained at step ii.,
a predicted friction map will be modeled to identify
landscape and environmental features that constrain
genetic connectivity. Locating genetic corridors across
landscapes will be crucial for the maintenance (plants)
or the removal (tick) of metapopulations. From spa-
tial and temporal congurations of landscapes obtained,
structural connectivity metrics derived from graph and
percolation theory will be compared to functional con-
nectivity measured as gene ows among populations.

PhD: ZEBRIGHT micro: Developing an instant, high
throughput and integrative vertebrate model to decipher
the interplay of factors controlling host-microbiota inter-
actions at the interface of health/disease. Supervisors:
Dr Nicolas Derome, Dr Grant VandenBerg, Dr Arnaud
Droit (Laval University, Quebec, Canada).
This PhD projet is connected to projects focusing on
optogenetics control and monitoring of gut microbiota,
optogenetics monitoring of neural function, leaded by
Dr Paul De Koninck and Dr Sylvain Moineau.
The intestinal microorganisms hosted by humans and
other vertebrates play a central role in maintaining their
hosts in healthy conditions. However, when the host en-
counters a physiological stress, the microbiota ecosystem
equilibrium is broken, allowing opportunistic microbial
strains to induce negative eects on the host, including
physiological disturbances on neuroendocrine functions
and epigenetics modications. During host development,
a stressed microbiota might induce irreversible conse-
quences on its brain development and neural functions,
aecting mental health. The Northern ecosystem is un-
dergoing unprecedented assaults from human activities,
leading to severe environmental changes that are modi-
fying the microbiota, eventually impacting on their host
vertebrates. The relationship between these complex
systems are poorly understood. To learn more about
host-microbiota interactions and their impact on mental
health, we must develop models and tools with which
we can accurately control the variables, relevant to the
environment, in a laboratory setting.
This PhD project objective is to develop a sh exper-20 EvolDir June 1, 2017
imental model in which we can control factors (nutri-
tion, contaminants/toxins, xenobiotics, bacterial strain,
phages, viruses) that modulate host-microbiota func-
tional interactions and measure the impact on the mi-
crobiota evolution, on brain function, and on host gene
expression. Basically, the student will investigate the im-
pact of these factors on the gut microbiota, on neuronal
development and brain circuit function and on epigenet-
ics. To reach this goal, two specic aims are needed: to
develop i) a protocol to produce routinely axenic larvae
of zebrash (Danio rerio), ii) synthetic microbiota (5
to 10 strains) to conventionalize axenic zebrash lar-
vae. This PhD project will involve a transdisciplinary
approach combining physiology, genomics and transcrip-
tomics analyses of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial
strains, and epigenetics analyses on developing host.
Also, the PhD candidate will have the invaluable oppor-
tunity to closely interact with sister projects focusing on
optogenetics control and monitoring of gut microbiota,
optogenetics monitoring of neural function. The project
will lay the bases of an experimental setting in which
several variables critically important for the Northern
ecosystems will be investigated.
Qualications and Requirements * Relevant background
in Molecular Evolution, Ecology, Molecular Biology,
Biochemistry or Cell Biology with related laboratory
experience. * Basic molecular techniques such as bac-
terial culture, PCR, sequencing library preparation. *
Background in bioinformatics (phylogeny, population

The Chair of Ecology and Environment Protection
(http://www.keib.umk.pl/?lang=en) is recruiting PhD
student interested in studying evolution of morphologi-
cal traits in plants at various time scales. The goal of
this project is to contribute towards an understanding
of how genetic architecture (the structure of genotype to
phenotype mapping) aects the evolution of quantitative
traits. According to quantitative genetics theory, the
evolution of phenotypic traits depends on the strength of
selection and the amount of genetic variation. However,
part of this variation maybe constrained by correlations
with other traits that are under conicting selective
regimes. In consequence, the ability to respond to se-
lection (evolvability) may be limited, even if a trait
has high heritability. However, the extent to which ge-
netic architecture limits phenotypic evolution remains
an open question. Likewise, it is unknown whether it
aects evolution at the short time scale and is easily
overcome by selection, or if the genetic architecture is
an important long-term determinant of the direction
of evolution. In this project we aim to answer these
questions using two plant species from the family Api-
aceae, Daucus carota and Ferula communis, as a model
system. This project will be carried out in collaboration
with Prof. Thomas Hansen (University of Oslo) and dr
Krzysztof Bartoszek (Uppsala University).
Major tasks: - phylogenetic analysis of various taxa from
the family Apiaceae based on RADseq data - establish a
database of phenotypic traits (seedlings, fruits, inores-
cences and owers), life history strategies and geographic
distributions for species from the family Apiaceae - es-
timate the rate of morphological trait evolution using
phylogenetic comparative methods - help in developing
the R package mvSLOUCH dedicated to analysis of
multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models on phylogeny
The ideal candidate will have a background in molecular
biology/population genetics/phylogenetics, as well as ex-perience working with Linux and modern programming
languages such as R. Previous experience in generating
and analysis of next-generation sequencing data will be
considered positively. A condition of the application
is a Master degree (or equivalent) in biology or similar
subjects.
The stipend for position is 3 000 PLN net monthly (app.
700 EURO) for three years. The living cost in Torun
is low. For example, a room in a student house (inc.
Wi-Fi, kitchen, heating, hot water) is app. 100-150
EURO monthly, loaf of bread 0.5 EURO, beer 0.5-0.7
EURO, beer in pub 1-2 EURO, dinner in restaurant 5-8
EURO.

PhD in Evolutionary Theory (Phylogenomics)
The PhD project is part of a larger project entitled
\Genome-wide molecular dating" between the groups of
Carolin Kosiol (University of St. Andrews / Vetmeduni
Vienna, http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/contact/-
staProle.aspx?sunid=ck202), Gergely Sz oll osi (Etv os
University Budapest, http://ssolo.web.elte.hu/), Asger
Hobolth (Aarhus University, http://www.daimi.au.dk/-
~asger/). The recent sequencing of genomes of closely
related species and of many individuals from the same
species enables the study of speciation and the inference
of the history of populations. Standard phylogenetic
methods reduce entire populations to single points in
genotypic space by modelling evolution as a process in
which a single gene mutates along the branches of a
phylogeny. In this project, we envisage developing new
theory and software to tackle the problem of species
tree estimation and molecular dating genome-wide. The
PhD student will be based with Dr. Carolin Kosiol at
the Centre of Biological Diversity of the University of
St. Andrews/Scotland. Visits to Vienna, Budapest and
Aarhus for close collaboration are planned. Starting
date is September 2017 or shortly thereafter. The
position will be funded for 3.5 years.
Candidates will be expected to have a strong interest in
applying quantitative methods and modelling to Biology.
They will have a degree in Bioinformatics, Mathematics,
Physics, Statistics, Computer Science or a related eld.
Prior experience with either population genetics or com-

MarineMicrobialEvolution
1) BBSRC-SFI PhD opportunity: Exploring the micro-
bial ecology and energetics of wild and domesticated
Atlantic Salmon.
Background: Energy economy underpins the success
and survival of all living organisms. Atlantic Salmon
must run numerous energetic gauntlets throughout their
lifecycle: seasonal anorexia in freshwater phases; out-
ward migrations as smolts; gorging and fat deposition
in marine feeding grounds; fasting as returning spawn-
ers. The timing of such events in the wild is likely
to be highly adaptive. Farmed sh, by contrast, may
have lost many key traits that guarantee survival in
this respect. An ambitious new research program is
underway at the University of Glasgow and University
College Cork (Ireland) to dene the contribution of in-
testinal microbes to the energetic plasticity in salmon.
Using a unique experimental river system based at the
Burrishoole Catchement, County Mayo, wild and do-
mesticated salmon are being reared in a common garden
experiment prior to transfer to experimental marine sea
cages to explore adaptive and maladaptive phenotypes
in the context of wild sh, farmed sh and farm escapes.
Aims and Objectives: The aim of this PhD program
is to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiome and
fermentation on the energetics (adiposity, SMR, growth,
nutritional energy harvest etc) of wild and domesticated
Atlantic Salmon in both freshwater and marine life cycle
phases. There is also an opportunity to study the ener-
getic proles of gut microbial communities isolate in the
eld in a novel ex-vivo system based at the University
of Glasgow.
Personal Specication: We are looking for an exception-
ally motivated and talented student to ll this generously
funded position. The student should have a 2.1 under-24 EvolDir June 1, 2017
graduate degree (or equivalent) in a biological eld and
a demonstrable interest and aptitude in one or more
aspects of this project. A master's degree is preferable
but not essential. Funding is provided through Univer-
sity College Cork, but the student will be based at the
University of Glasgow with considerable time at the
Burrishoole Field site.
Funding and Eligibility: This PhD carries a full stipend
for 4 years as well as some consumables and travel funds.
Fees are limited to EU nationals only.
2) Burrishoole Ecosystem Observatory Network (Beyond
2020): Microbial ecology of anadromous and catadro-
mous teloests.
Background: The Newport catchement system at Bur-
rishoole on the West Coast of Ireland (Co Mayo) is
among the most exenstively monitored aquatic ecosys-
tems in the world. Full records of anadromous and
catadromous sh movements and assciated environemn-
tal data have been gathered since 1970 with the eariest
records dating back to 1955. The catchement system
is comprised of a series of freshwater loughs and water
courses, as well as brackish water loughs that stretching
from Bunaveela Lough on the far north of the system
to the brackish water Lough Furnace, adjacent to neigh-
bouring Clew Bay. A new project BEYOND 2020 will
use the unique Burrishoole ecosystem as a living labo-
ratory to understand aquatic ecology in an era of un-
precedented environmental change, via the exploitation
of past data and current sample collection facilities.
Aims and Activities: The aim of this PhD program will
be to explore the role of tissue-specic microbial com-
munities of stickleback and European eel collected from
contrasting saltwater and freshwater environments in
the Burrishoole ecosystem in inuencing adaptation and
environmental tolerance. We expect this PhD program
to take a holistic approach, potentially incorporating
host genetics, host-microbiome interactions, pathogen
exposure and resistance, to understand the potential
constraints involved with exploiting novel and/or chang-
ing environments. The project will also have access to
common garden experiment facilities, both in the lab, as
well in nature via the Burrishoole experimental stream
system.
Personal Specication: We are looking for an exception-
ally motivated and talented student to ll this generously
funded position. The student should have a 2.1 under-

Master project: Population dierences in redox status in
response to variable temperature regimes in a European
buttery.
The Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology and the Zoological Institute & Museum at the
University of Greifswald jointly oer a Master project
at the interface between biochemistry and ecology. In
the context of climate change, the general aim of the
project is to examine whether animal populations nat-
urally subject to dierent temperature regimes dier
physiologically when exposed to new stressful thermal
conditions. More specically, the project will focus
on the eects of variable temperature regimes on the
redox status of dierent populations of green-veined
white butteries (Pieris napi). Butteries have already
been collected across a latitudinal gradient in dierent
European countries, exposed to dierent temperature
regimes, and prepared for further laboratory analyses.
The project can therefore start as soon as possible.
The candidate should have a strong background in
biochemistry and laboratory techniques as well as a
clear interest for ecological questions (e.g. student
in biochemistry, biology, veterinary medicine). The
candidate should also be willing to spend much
time in the lab and to analyze large datasets. If
desired, following this Master project, the selected
candidate will have the opportunity to apply to a PhD

PhD position on computational models of collective
escape of bird ocks 1.0 fte (217006H)
- Back to the overview
Organisation
Founded in 1614, the University of Groningen enjoys aninternational reputation as a dynamic and innovative
center of higher education oering high-quality teaching
and research. Flexible study programmes and academic
career opportunities in a wide variety of disciplines en-
courage the 30,000 students and researchers alike to
develop their own individual talents. As one of the
best research universities in Europe, the University of
Groningen has joined forces with other top universities
and networks worldwide to become a truly global center
of knowledge.
The Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sci-
ences (GELIFES - http://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/)
GELIFES, the largest institute of the Faculty of Mathe-
matics and Natural Sciences (FMNS) lls a special niche
in the life sciences by covering and integrating mechanis-
tic, evolutionary and ecological approaches, aiming to
understand adaptation on all levels of biological organi-
sation. Researchers pursue fundamental questions while
collaborating with partners from industry, medicine and
other realms of society. Our research elds include be-
havioural biology, chronobiology, ecology, evolutionary
biology, genetics and genomics, neurobiology, physiology
and theoretical modelling, using a wide array of research
tools. Research levels range from molecular and organ-
ismal to population and community, performed under
laboratory, semi-natural and eld conditions.
Job description
One of the advantages of group life, such as in birds, is
increased protection against predation. Increased pro-
tection is, for instance, assured by the complex patterns
of collective escape by bird ocks under attack. These
patterns may confuse the predator. Collective behaviour
of ocks is, however, dicult to investigate empirically.
As a solution, the proposed project concerns the com-
putational modelling of collective escapes. This is done
with the help of empirical data collected by another
PhD candidate using robot-falcons (RoboFalcons) for
controlled attacks on ocks. The empirical study is
aimed at driving ocks away in a specic direction for
preventing collisions between ocks and airplanes. The
PhD candidates will closely exchange data and results.
The modelling project aims to gain understanding on
what causes dierent patterns of collective escape under
dierent conditions. For this, the PhD candidate will
extend our computational model, StarDisplay, and may
develop new models. The model will be informed by
two empirical sources, namely, the experiments with
RoboFalcons and the movies of huge starling ocks
under attack by Peregrine falcons above Rome. The
student will experiment with dierent escape strategies
and attack strategies in the model to improve both un-
derstanding of the observations of patterns of collective
escape and methods of driving ocks away. Daily super-26 EvolDir June 1, 2017
vision will come from Prof. Charlotte Hemelrijk and Dr
Hanno Hildenbrandt; Dr Colin Torney (Glasgow, UK)
will co-supervise the project.
Qualications
The successful candidate will have previous research
experience in theoretical modelling, be in good com-
mand of the English language (oral and written) and
possess excellent communication skills (indicated by
the ability to write scientic papers and deliver presen-
tations). Since studies on self-organisation are highly
interdisciplinary, successful candidates are expected to
demonstrate an active and supportive approach to inter-
disciplinary research and collaborate with other group
members. Suitable candidates can be either individuals
with a background in the computational (life) sciences,
with interest in evolutionary and biological questions, or
evolutionary biologists with experience in computational
modelling.
Candidates for the PhD position should have: - MSc in
theoretical biology, a MSc in computational science with
focus on biology or an MSc in computational physics
with specialization in biology, MSc in Articial Intelli-
gence with a specialization in an area of computational
or mathematical biology or a MSc in Biology, with a spe-
cialization in an area of computational or mathematical
biology - experience with developing computer simula-
tion code and a sucient background in mathematics
- a strong interest in collective, swarming behaviour,
biomechanics of ight, attack and escape. Candidates
with research experience in these areas are particularly
encouraged to apply.
Conditions of employment

Evolutionary Biology of Transposable Elements In Pro-
tists
Supervisors: Dr Martin Carr, Dr Christopher Cooper
(University of Hudderseld), Dr Roy Chaudhuri (Uni-
versity of Sheeld)
The research programme for this studentship, part of
our Hudderseld^ a euro s Leverhulme Trust funded Post-
doctoral Training Centre, will focus on the evolution
of transposable elements (TEs) within the genomes of
unicellular eukaryotes (protists). Past research on TEs
has centred upon the multicellular eukaryotes, with an
emphasis on animals, fungi and plants; however, most of
life's diversity is found within protists. Protist species
have very dierent population dynamics to multicellular
organisms and this is likely to have a resulting impact
on the evolution of their TEs. The choanoagellates
are the protistan sister-group to animals and prelimi-
nary work has shown major dierences between their
TE families and the families present in animal genomes.
This project aims to expand upon this work. The full
TE compliments of 19 species of choanoagellate will be
sequenced and subject to phylogenetic and population
genetic analyses. Phylogenetics will be used to deter-
mine the con tribution of horizontal transfer, as well
gene loss, to TE evolution. Population genetic analyses
will determine the role of natural selection on TE family
evolution, with an emphasis on the codon usage of TE
genes. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to study
TEs in additional protist groups to identify any general
trends in their evolution.
The proposed research will cover transcriptomics, high-
throughput sequencing, phylogenetics and population
genetics. The successful applicant will also be encour-
aged to devise their own research projects during the
course of the PhD.
The students will work in new molecular biology facili-
ties alongside existing students in protist research, who
will provide day to day guidance, along with the super-
visor. There will be a strong emphasis on data analysis
and interpretation, as well cutting-edge laboratory work,
and on producing world-class research papers.
Applicants should hold, or be expected to gain, a good
bachelor's degree in Genetics, Molecular Biology, Statis-
tics, Computing, or other relevant subject, and ideallyJune 1, 2017 EvolDir 27
have experience of computer programming, as well as
generic biological lab techniques. Although training and
hands-on supervision will be provided, it is essential
that the candidates can operate independently and take
the initiative to direct their research.
The studentship will cover the full cost of tuition fees
for UK/EU students, and will pay an annual tax-free
bursary of 14,553 for three years (RCUK rates). There
are additional funds available for laboratory consum-
ables and travel for conferences, visits to collaborating
laboratories and sample procurement.

Job description The incredible diversity of insects makes
them fascinating to study, with important applications
in the characterisation of animal biology, the control
of disease vectors and pests, and the conservation of
threatened insects. Falling sequencing costs are improv-
ing genomic species sampling and enriching sources offunctional data, challenging researchers to nd inno-
vative approaches to best exploit these data to bring
new levels of depth and detail to our understanding
of biology. Overcoming these challenges requires sub-
stantial methodological advances in data integration
and interrogation, supported by robust computational
infrastructures. With an initial focus on disease-vector
mosquitoes, this SNSF-funded research project aims
to exploit genomic evolutionary signatures to enhance
the understanding of putative functions of thousands
of currently uncharacterised genes from hundreds of
organisms.
The successful candidate will be based at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution of the University of
Lausanne, under the supervision of Prof. Robert Wa-
terhouse (www.rmwaterhouse.org). S/he will work very

ULaval ArmsRaceStickleback
PhD position: Genomics basis of the arms race between
a parasite and its host, the threespine stickleback
A fully-funded 4-year PhD position is available in the
Aubin-Horth and Landry Laboratories at Universite
Laval in Quebec City, Canada. The PhD student will
work on a project aimed at dissecting the genomic bases
of the co-evolution between the threespine stickleback
and its worm parasite, Schistocephalus solidus.
The candidate is expected to have a Master degree in
biology or a related discipline, and a background in
bioinformatics (R, Python or Perl), statistics and ge-
nomics. The candidate should have strong leadership
skills, motivation and creativity and be able to work in
a team of collaborators.
The Aubin-Horth and Landry Laboratories are located
at the Institut de Biologie Int egrative et des Syst emes
(IBIS) at Universit e Laval. IBIS oers a very stimu-
lating training environment and cutting edge on-site
platforms in genomics, proteomics and microscopy. The
Aubin-Horth Lab members are evolutionary biologists,
neuroendocrinologists and behaviour biologists work-
ing together using an integrative approach to uncover
the mechanisms underlying the alteration of stickleback
behaviour by its endoparasite, by studying both the
host and its parasite at the molecular, cellular and hor-
monal level, as well as how they interact. The Landry
lab is an international team of 15 students, PDFs and
research associates from dierent backgrounds (microbi-
ology, biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry) addressing
questions in evolutionary cell and systems biology.
The application package (1 single PDF le) should in-
clude a motivation letter demonstrating the interest of
the candidate for the eld and his/her ability to perform

Title: Using genetics of captive and wild meta-
populations of mega-herbivores (elephants and rhinos)
to inform conservation planning initiatives
Project Outline
Wild populations of large herbivores play a vital role
to the functioning of African ecosystems but are in-
creasingly endangered as a result of poaching and loss
and fragmentation of their habitat (Ripple et al. 2015).
The International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) Conservation Breeding Specialist Group(CGSG)
highlights that to achieve viable populations of species
thriving in healthy ecosystems conservation planning
initiatives must involve integrated species conservation
planning that considers all populations of the species
(inside and outside the natural range) under all condi-
tions of management. Therefore, prior to implementing
gene ow between in situ and ex situ populations, it
is key that we characterise genetic diversity and un-
derstand the likely consequences of gene ow within
and among captive and wild populations. It is essential
to avoid: inbreeding depression due to the breeding of
closely related animals; loss of genetic distinctiveness
and loss of local adaptation due to the interbreeding
of genetically distinct subspecies; and adaptation to
captivity that results in individuals poorly adapted to
natural conditions. Any of these can result in reducingthe tness of managed populations, making matters
worse rather than better. However, knowledge of the
genetic composition of potential donor and recipient
populations can ensure that introduced individuals en-
hance and complement local genetic variation boosting
the success of that population and so the whole species.
This project will focus on the population genetics of two
African large herbivores; the eastern black rhino and
the African elephant with the aim to integrate genetic
information into population management and improve
overall viability of endangered species.

Helpcontrol the vegetable leafminer, a major quarantine
threat for our food production systems
Supervisors:Prof Ary Homann (Bio21 Institute, the
University of Melbourne), Dr Peter Ridland (Honorary
Fellow, the University of Melbourne) and Dr Paul Umina
(Bio21 Institute, the University of Melbourne and cesar)
Thegreater project: The vegetable leaf miner (VLM)
is a polyphagous species of agromyzid y capable of
infesting vegetable and ower crops and driving severe
crop losses. In 2015, the rst detection of VLM within
Australia was made on Cape York Peninsula, and VLM
is now considered at high risk of establishing within
major production zones across Australia and causing
severe detrimental impacts on Australian agriculture.
This masters project will form one part of a greater
project, funded by Horticulture Innovation Australia,
which will combine molecular, morphological, modelling,
chemical and biocontrol methods to detect, eradicate
and manage VLM.
Thecollaborative team: The greater project, \RD&E
program for control, eradication and preparedness for
Vegetable leafminer" involves several partners includ-
ing The University of Melbourne, AUSVEG, cesar pty
ltd, Plant Health Australia and the North Australian
Quarantine Authority.
Themasters component: Biological control is a poten-
tially signicant tool for the management and eradi-30 EvolDir June 1, 2017
cation of VLM. This project will identify candidate
parasitoid wasps for the biocontrol of VLM through a
combination of literature reviews and eld collections
of agromyzids and their parasitoids across Australia.
The project is expected to include a signicant eld
work component, largely within key agricultural produc-
tion areas of southern Australia, but with the potential
to travel to the Cape York Peninsula. An interest in
taxonomy and/or molecular methods would be ideal.
Thisproject includes scholarship support of $7,500 per
annum, and also includes ALL funds to support research
and eldwork costs.
***Thestudent undertaking this research will play a
crucial role in developing sustainable control of a new
threat to Australia's agricultural industry.***

ArbovirusEvolution
We have a funded PhD position on the population ge-

interested, please contact seran.gutierrez@cirad.fr and
etienne.loire@cirad.fr <mailto:etienne.loire@cirad.fr >
with the string \PhD BTV" in the subject eld.
Where: ASTRE lab, Montpellier, France (http://umr-
astre.cirad.fr/)
Title: Adaptive mechanisms facilitating host alternation
in Bluetongue virus
Starting date: September 2017
Deadline for application: 15th July 2017
Funding: The candidate is funded for 3 years (H2020-
funded project)
Context:
Many viruses are transmitted by arthropod vectors, like
mosquitoes and biting midges, and cause signicant dis-
ease in humans and livestock worldwide. The life cycle
of such arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) is rathercomplex as it necessitates alternation between largely
unrelated hosts: arthropods and vertebrates. This sit-
uation suggests that viral mechanisms have evolved to
facilitate host switching, thus increasing the likelihood
of disease emergence in new hosts. Given the impor-
tance of these viruses, it is surprising that the existence
of such mechanisms has been largely understudied.
Goals:
The candidate will explore three potential mechanisms
facilitating host alternation: (i) rapid adaptation follow-
ing horizontal transmission1, (ii) cooperation among the
genotypes infecting a host (i.e. quasispecies behaviour)2
and (iii) variation in viral gene expression through regu-
lation of gene copy number variation3. To this end, the
candidate will analyse the genetics of virus populations
in experimental infections in arthropods and vertebrates
using, among others, deep sequencing and bioinformat-
ics. The main biological model will be Bluetongue virus
(BTV), an arbovirus transmitted by biting midges and
causing disease in ruminants worldwide4. The hosting
laboratory already possesses samples from experimental
infections of sheep and midges that can facilitate rapid
result generation. In addition, the candidate will carry
out experimental evolution of BTV populations in insect
and vertebrate cell cultures to further investigate the
existence of the proposed mechanisms. Depending on
timing, the conservation of the results in other arbovirus
models (for example, mosquito-borne viruses) will be
attempted.
Prole: We seek for a candidate interested in virus evolu-
tion and willing to use bioinformatics and experimental
infections.
Keywords: Arbovirus, evolution, emergence, host alter-
nation, bluetongue, sheep, vector.
Disciplines/Background: Population genetics, evolution,
bioinformatics, virology.

PhylogeneticComparativeAnalysis
A PhD position: Climate Change: phylogenetic compar-
ative analysis, meta-analysis and computational mod-
elling UNSW has announced another round of presti-
gious PhD scholarship (http://www.2025.unsw.edu.au/-
apply). We have been lucky enough to have been
awarded one of these.
This project comes with $40,000 per year stipend and
$10,000 of research funding per year (for full 4 years). It
is open to both Australian and international applicants.
The topic is broad intentionally to attract an outstand-
ing student: Climate change is impacting ecosystems
worldwide. Many plant and animal species will not sur-
vive unless their distributions shift. However, not all
species are moving and we don't systematically under-
stand why.
This is a key challenge for understanding climate impact.
In this project students will tackle important knowledge
gaps: Can we use functional traits to predict species'
ability to shift distributions? Which biotic and abiotic
factors are important in determining species range? Do
dierent processes act at northern vs southern limits?
And, are distributions shaped by extreme climate events,
or by the average conditions at a site? We will tackle
a range of questions relating to climate change using
phylogenetic comparative methods, meta-analysis and
computational modelling (our supervisor team members
are experts in these areas).
Given the generous stipend and project funding, an
applicant is expected to be very competitive. We expect
an applicant to have at least one peer-reviewed publica-tion or an equivalent publication or experience which
demonstrate their outstanding abilities.

UZH Switzerland PlantAdaptation
Two PhD positions funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation are available from June 2017 in the group
of Prof. Schiestl at the Department of Systematic and
Evolutionary Botany, University of Z urich, for a period
of four years. The positions are to study the ecological
and molecular bases of plant adaptation to biotic and
abiotic habitat parameters. In one project, reciprocal
transplants in natural populations will be conducted to
study local adaptation to pollinators, herbivores, and
soil in a wild species of Brassica in Southern Italy. In
the second project, experimental evolution using fast
cycling Brassica plants will be used to investigate real-
time adaptation to these habitat parameters. In both
projects, the traits modulating adaptations as well as
their molecular bases will be studied using selection
analysis, phenotyping (including oral volatiles), as well
as molecular and bioinformatics tools. You should have
a Master degree in any eld of biology and a thorough
interest in evolutionary biology. Prior experience with
plants and/or insects is an advantage. Prociency in
English both orally and written is a must; for the project
including eld work in Italy, knowledge of Italian and a
drivers licence is desirable. The successful candidates
will work in an exciting research environment focussing
on patterns and process of plant evolution. Our de-
partment is located in the botanical gardens and house
modern molecular and ecological labs, including green-
houses and climate chambers for plant cultivation. The
University of Z urich has a very broad coverage of or-
ganismal and molecular biology, and several research
groups work on evolutionary topics (www.lifescience-
zurich.ch). The city also oers excellent quality of life
through cultural programs and infrastructure, as well
as an attractive surrounding.
If you are interested in the job, please send me by
e-mail (orian.schiestl@systbot.uzh.ch ) a letter describ-
ing your motivation, C.V., copy of degrees, publications
(manuscripts), and e-mail addresses of two academic
referees, by 25st of June 2017. If you have any further
questions, don`t hesitate to contact me.

PhD position: Ecology of plant-mycorrhizal interactions
We are seeking a PhD student with a background (MSc
degree) in ecology, biology, or a closely related discipline.
The successful applicant will be based at the Department
of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of
the University of Zurich, Switzerland.
The mutualism between plants and arbuscular mycor-
rhizal fungi (AMF) is widespread and has persisted for
over 400 million years. The stability of this mutualism
depends on a \fair trade" between plants and fungi, and
on mechanisms that protect this system from exploita-
tion by \cheaters". Indeed, plants and AMF are able
to discriminate symbiotic partners through a range of
mechanisms and invest selectively into dierent partners,
depending on the relative quality of their service.
The successful applicant will analyze the trade of car-
bon and nutrients among plants and AMF in a series
of experiments, using methods that include isotope la-
beling and molecular tools. The overall objective of the
project is to characterize the strategies of both part-
ners in the light of game-theoretical and network-based
model predictions. A particularly interesting question
will be how strategies of plants and fungi scale from
pairwise interactions to systems with multiple species
involved.
We are looking for a highly motivated, enthusiastic, and
independent PhD candidate who has a strong interest
in ecological and evolutionary questions. An accurate
and clean laboratory working style is absolutely essen-
tial. Experience with standard molecular biological
techniques is benecial. A high standard of written and
spoken English is essential.
The successful applicant will be supported and super-
vised by Pascal Niklaus and Jordi Bascompte (University
of Zurich), Ansgar Kahmen (University of Basel), and
Marcel van der Heijden (Agroscope Reckenholz).

UArizona LabManager HostParasite
New Lab Manager position in the Schlenke Lab at the
University of Arizona
Position summary: The Schlenke Lab studies host-
parasite coevolution using Drosophila (fruit ies) as
model hosts. We are developing parasitoid wasps, which
lay their eggs in y larvae and consume their hosts
from the inside out, as model parasites. Flies mount
cellular and behavioral defense responses against wasps,
but wasps have adaptations for nding host y larvae,
suppressing host cellular immunity, and manipulating
host behavior. We use a variety of \omics" tools to un-
derstand the molecular genetics of y cellular immunity
and wasp virulence, as well as patterns of host immunity
and pathogen virulence coevolution across y and wasp
phylogenies. For more information, visit our lab website
at: https://cals.arizona.edu/research/schlenke/ We are
looking to hire a motivated, creative, and collaborative
lab manager to keep the lab running smoothly. Our

expertise) in multiple aspects of biology, such as in evolu-
tionary ecology, genetics, molecular and cell biology, im-
munology, neurobiology, and/or bioinformatics. Our lab

We are looking for a research eld technician to assist
on a project that is investigating a recent evolutionary
event - the rescue of male Hypolimnas bolina buttery
embryos from Wolbachia-induced male-killer activity.
Normally, female butteries infected with a male-killing
strain of Wolbachia are only able to produce female
ospring. H. bolina has evolved the ability to rescue
male embryos, so that infected females are able to pro-
duce both male and female ospring. This project aims
to understand the genetic basis of this suppressor trait
and to assess the impact that Wolbachia infection and
suppression have on the tness of butteries.
The position is tenable for 5 months, commencing in
June 2017 and will primarily be based in French Polyne-
sia. The main responsibilities of the role will be to assist
a post-doctoral research associate with breeding large
buttery pedigrees. You will assist with all aspects of
maintaining buttery stocks e.g. collecting caterpillar
food, feeding and cleaning out caterpillars, feeding but-
teries. You will also assist with performing a series
of behavioural and tness assays, storage of biologicalsamples, data recording, molecular biology work e.g.
DNA extraction, PCR, and other duties that may also
arise.
We are looking for someone who is experienced at in-
sect handling, and with previous experience of rearing
insects and performing experiments involving insects.
The nature of the work will mean that you must be
happy to work outdoors in dierent weather conditions,
and be prepared to work exible hours, depending upon
the stage of the experiment. The candidate will need to
hold at least a BTEC National level qualication or its
equivalent and be in possession of a full drivers licence.
Previous experience of overseas eldwork is desirable as
are French language skills.
This position requires the right to the work in the UK,

Apply For PhylotasticHackathon
Aug8-11
Dear evoldir community^ a euro \
We invite interested scientists, programmers and ed-
ucators to apply for a 4-day hackathon centered on
leveraging resources of the Phylotastic project, includ-
ing its graphical web portal, its suite of web services,
and its toolbox code.
An implicit promise of the Tree of Life project is that,
ultimately, expert knowledge of species phylogeny will
be accessible and usable by everyone. The Phylotas-
tic project (http://www.phylotastic.org) aims to meet
this challenge with a sustainable ecosystem of open
web services providing access to dispersed resources
covering the tree of life and related knowledge of taxon-
omy, characters, and biodiversity. The system includes
over 20 web services for operations such as reconciling
names, managing lists of taxa, getting trees, nding
images, and so on. Workows based on these services
can be invoked with toolbox code in various program-
ming languages. The Phylotastic web portal (access via
http://www.phylotastic.org) illustrates on-the-y deliv-
ery of species trees based on web services that extract
taxon names from electronic sources, nd topologies
from available supertrees, scale them by time, harvest
images and other data, and render the results graphi-
cally. This tool is suitable for use in developing lesson
plans about phylogeny for students in both K-12 and in
universities.
The purpose of the hackathon, which will take place
August 8 to 11, 2017 at NIMBioS (Knoxville, TN), is to
stimulate further developments that add to this systemor leverage it to support research, education, or public
appreciation of science. The targets of the hackathon
are not determined in advance: projects and teams will
emerge in a bottom-up participatory process. Examples
of suitable projects would be to embed Phylotastic func-
tionality into existing tools (e.g., tree-viewers, apps of
any kind that generate or use taxon lists), to build new
clients (e.g., phylogeny-learning games, tools to popu-
late EOL taxon pages with trees), to develop classroom
exercises, and so on. We welcome big-picture ideas like
developing a system to gather, cross-map and dissemi-
nate phyloreferences, or using available tools to evaluate
robustness and coverage of OpenTree's resources.
Whether you are a researcher, a curator, an educator, or
something else, we encourage you to apply for participa-
tion: our goal is a collaborative environment welcoming
the contributions of all. Support for airfare, lodging and
meals will be provided. To apply, use the online form
at http://bit.ly/2qAXuDk to provide brief descriptions
of your ideas, your skills and your domain knowledge.
Members of underrepresented groups are especially en-
couraged to apply. Further information is available at

EquatorialGuinea VolResAssist
Biodiversity
Job Title: Monkey & Sea Turtle Research Assistant
Job Type: Volunteer Position
Opportunity location: Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea,
Africa
Start date: November 2017; 5 months commitment.
Closing date: 31 August 2017
Opportunity Description:
The Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program (BBPP) is
seeking volunteers to assist with data collection primar-
ily on the ecology of primates and nesting sea turtles in
our two research camps on the southern beaches of Bioko
Island, Equatorial Guinea. BBPP will engage eld as-
sistants for a period of 5 months during the upcoming
dry season, beginning in November and lasting through
March. Field assistants are expected to devote at least
40 hrs/week to the project, but due to the nature of
the project and living conditions, hours will likely be
considerably more.
Field assistants work under the supervision of BBPP
Research Camp Managers, Drexel & UNGE Researchers,
the BBPP In-Country Manager, and Dr. Mary Kather-
ine Gonder (BBPP Director). They are encouraged to
participate in all aspects of eld research during their
stay on Bioko Island and may explore additional oppor-
tunities to participate in educational outreach projects
with local school children as well as training exercises
with local wildlife patrols.
Primary research activities include tagging nesting
sea turtles, gathering reproductive output data on
leatherback and green turtles, conducting large mammal
biomonitoring surveys, and fecal collection for micro-
biome analyses. Turtle surveys are conducted every
night until 5 am. Assistants will walk an average of
10 km/night while patrolling the beaches. Primate sur-
veys will be conducted during the day for 2 weeks each
month along established BBPP transects together with
a trained team of local survey workers. Sampling of
primate and other mammal feces will also be conducted
during the day, but will occur o-trail with the use of
a handheld GPS unit. Participation in other research
projects are possible and encouraged.Due to accessibility, tourism, hunting and other factors,
the dynamics dier between the two eld camps. Volun-
teers working at Moaba, located 5km from the nearest
road, will participate mostly in the following activities:
aiding in the facilitation of short-term ecotourism visits
to research camps as part of a small-scale, locally lead
ecotourism initiative; monitoring nesting beaches nightly
as part of BBPP's marine turtle research program; and
aiding park management authorities in conservation ac-
tivities and monitoring. Conversely, Moraka is located
13km from the nearest road and is visited less frequently.
Volunteers at Moraka will focus their eorts on marine
turtle monitoring research, primate surveys, and sam-
ple collections. However, assisting in all aspects of the
project is possible throughout the season.
Our eld sites are in remote areas with no road access.
Researchers and eld assistants must hike in and out of
the eld site(s) when necessary along extremely rough
terrain. Researchers and eld assistants will be living
in tents, cooking over re, and using water from nearby
streams. Field assistants are also required to partic-
ipate in daily upkeep and maintenance of the camp,
including preparation of meals. The diet is very lim-
ited due to lack of electricity/refrigerators. There is
no internet connection, but cell service is available yet
unreliable. A satellite phone will be available in case of
an emergency. The camp does have generators to charge
research equipment, which may be used for occasional
personal items.
This is an unpaid (volunteer) position. However, BBPP
will provide housing (tents), food and local transporta-
tion. You are expected to provide international trans-
portation to and from Malabo, Equatorial Guinea ( ^A
$2000 for a round trip ight from US), medical and
evacuation insurance, appropriate immunizations (yel-
low fever) and medications (anti-malarial medications).
Non-US citizens will need to apply for a visa to enter
Equatorial Guinea. We will try to obtain a letter of
invitation through the local university in Malabo but
cannot guarantee a visa.
Qualications:
- Field assistants are expected to be at least 21 years
old.
- Field assistants are REQUIRED to have:
- B.A. or B.S. in biology, ecology, environmental science,
or related disciplines

Nepal VolunteerTeaching
Dear Sir-June 1, 2017 EvolDir 63
Could you please spread this message to those that are
interested?
We are looking a short/long term volunteers to serve
in rural areas of Nepal to teach lower secondary level
students in one of the Government school. The vol-
unteer teacher may choose to teach science (including
evolution), English, Math or their subject of interest
with exible date of start.
The school does not have any other source of funding
to support the teacher at the moment. The upcoming
teacher may come with their own support (some phi-
lantrophic or organization). Living cost here is expected
to be around 150 U $$/Month. The volunteer position
may also suite to anyone who has free time.
You may choose to live in Tamang community (learn
their ethnic language or Nepalese language), do some
treks in world famous mountain in this small tiny coun-
try located between India and China during holidays.
Those who are looking to work in stress free environ-
ment and interested in doing something new, it will be
a great opportunity as well as challenge. Please keep in
mind that earthquake has severely damage many infras-
tructures and it will take a years to gain original shape.
You must be very sensitive/exible regarding situation.
However, your contribution in these timing will be great
for the school.
Furthermore, enthusiasts can often do research in their
own time, write their scholar activities like books, pa-
pers etc.Some of the great question could be asked such
as what is DNA lineage and SNPs in these community ,
if one has facility (lab test, or analysis) to do research
besides teaching for their thesis or publications.
Please contact me for further arrangements.

Plant micrographs wanted
Hello Plant Biologists of Evoldir,
A few months ago I sent out an email on evoldir to asses
interest among the plant biologist community for an
automated tool to phenotype stomatal traits. I received
a positive response from many of you and it's clear the
community needs a tool to make stomatal phenotyping
easier. Sven Eberhardt (Brown Uni.) and I have devel-
oped a tool to automatically count stomata and we have
trained it on several hundred Balsam Poplar epidermal
micrographs. The method appears to work very well for64 EvolDir June 1, 2017
Balsam Poplars (machine v. human annotation has r2
= 0.92), but can't recognize stoma from other taxa .at
all.
It's clear that the training set needs to grow, and that's
why I'm reaching out to the plant biologists of ecolog.
I'm searching for collaborators who can contribute sev-
eral hundred high quality epidermal micrographs and
then annotate them using the website we've developed.
Here are the parameters that your images need to abide
by:
+ The sample should come from populations within a
species that encompasses a wide range of phenotypic
variation. + Micrographs must be high quality, i.e. ma-
jority of image in focus, stomata clearly visible and
unobstructed by epidermal features (e.g. trichomes). +
Micrographs should be imaged at 400x + Any prepara-
tion method is acceptable as long as it is a good prep.
I am particularly interested in nding contributors for
the following groups: Pinus, Oryza, Arabidopsis, Brachy-
podium, Maize, Populus, Medicago, and Mimulus.
Collaborators will need to contribute and annotate sev-
eral hundred ( ~200 - 500) images in the next few weeks.
In recognition of that eort you will be invited to join
the project as a co-author, or acknowledged if you pre-
fer. In addition to co-authorship/acknowledgement,
contributors will have access to a beta version of the
tool/website, and the method will perform very well
on your particular preparation methodology and set of
individuals.
If you are interested in learning more, please email me
and include a zip le of a representative sample of images.
If you need to transfer large les, you can use UVM's
large le transfer service https://letransfer.uvm.edu/
. Thanks for the interest Evoldir & I can't wait to see
what's out there.

SocialMoleRats
Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis).
We are looking for voluntary research assistants to help
with our research on the completely subterranean, highly
social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) in
the Kalahari. 1 position starting as soon as possible
and one position starting later this year; duration: 6
months.
The position entails assisting in several studies on social
evolution and hormonal eects on social behaviour of
mole-rats. We are interested in the eects of hormonal
variation on allo-parental care and the eects of variation
in the social environment on behaviour and physiology in
mole-rats. The research assistant will be involved in all
steps of the experiments and will mainly work in the lab-
oratory with our captive mole-rats which are housed in
large semi-natural tunnel systems. The responsibilities
include behavioural observations, hormonal measures
(blood sampling, urine sampling), obtaining morpholog-
ical measures by X-Ray, and hormonal manipulations.
The laboratory is situated in the Kuruman River Re-
serve in the southern Kalahari, Northern Cape province
of South Africa. Occasionally the research assistant will
have the possibility to assist in trapping wild mole-rats
in the surrounding nature reserve.
The successful applicant will work in a team of 5-10
persons and will receive extensive training to acquire
the skills needed for the above mentioned data collec-
tion. The research station is also the home of sev-
eral other projects studying meerkats (www.kalahari-
meerkats.com), cape ground squirrels, pied babblers,
forktailed drongos and hornbills resulting in a stimu-
lating scientic environment. Around 20-30 research
assistants are based at the station year round. Research
assistants will learn a range of skills such as remote
sensing of behaviour, endocrine sampling techniques, be-
havioural observations, data handling and management.
Applicants should be enthusiastic, willing to work hard
and keen to get involved in a research project in a remote
location.
We provide accommodation, and research assistants are
paid a monthly allowance to cover their personal costs
and food. Domestic travel to the eld site can be coveredbut we cannot provide an international airfare, travel
insurance, or visa fees for applicants from overseas.
Applications received until the 3rd of June 2017 are
ensured full consideration for the position with earlier
staring date. Later applications will be considered for
the position staring towards the end of this year (exible
staring date). Please apply by email including a cover

A research assistant position is available for durations of
one to two months (within the period from August 1st
to November 31th 2017) in the Biological Interactions
Lab (www.biointeractionslab.com) in the Department of
Botany and Zoology at Stellenbosch University, South
Africa.
Work will be based in Namaqualand during the an-
nual spring mass-owering displays. Namaqualand is a
semi-desertic area of astonishing plant diversity which
is part of the Succulent Karoo Biodiversity hotspot.
We will conduct pollinator observations, in Situ experi-
ments, and collect DNA material and plant trait mea-
surements on the unique long-tongued y pollination
systems across a large area (300km long). Long-tongue
ies are unique to southern Africa, many are undescribed
as yet, but still they are key-stone species as over 250
species of plants rely on them for reproduction. The
plant species we focus on are from the Iridaceae and
Geraniaceae families.
Candidates need to be hard-working, naturalist-minded,
willing to spend long hours in the eld and spend most
nights camping. A previous experience in pollination
biology will be an advantage. Such eldwork is highly
rewarding to the naturalist-minded persons. Namaqua-
land is a unique ecosystem, and new discoveries are
plentiful.
Food, accommodation, and a small stipend will be pro-
vided. Travel costs to South-Africa are not included.

The Company Background
Embark is an early-stage, VC-backed startup launched
in 2016. The company's long-term vision is to end pre-
ventable diseases in pets. With its high-throughput
DNA genotyping platform and cutting-edge bioinfor-
matics, Embark looks to discover and develop a new
generation of breeding tools, novel genetic tests, clinical
practice, and wellness regimens for pet care. The com-
pany believes that these revolutionary advancements
in pet health may even have powerful applications in
human healthcare.
Embark's agship product is a canine DNA test that
provides a comprehensive genetic prole unmatched in
scope or accuracy by any other test on the market to-
day. The test is built around proprietary genotyping
technology coupled with the world's largest and fastest-
growing canine DNA reference database. This allows
Embark to use a simple saliva sample to report on an un-
precedented range of health diagnostics, color and coat
traits, breeding heritage, and wellness predictors. Taken
together, these advantages make Embark \dierent-in-
kind" to everything else on the market today and will
be a uniquely powerful engine for scientic discovery.
Embark's founders are recognized leaders in the canine
genomics research community and bring more than a
decade of eld and lab work experience to the venture.

POSTDOC IN GENOMICS OF SELECTION RE-
SPONSE IN MICE
Friedrich Miescher Laboratory, Max Planck Campus,
T ubingen, Germany
A postdoctoral researcher position is available in the
Chan Lab to work on a unique genomics dataset in mice,
with the aim of understanding the molecular basis of
phenotypic variation and response to selection in a pop-
ulation genetics and quantitative genetics framework.
We're looking for a postdoc skilled in population and/or
statistical genomics to take on the analysis of a repli-
cated articial selection experiment in mice. In order to
study major morphological changes in a model organ-
ism, our collaborator, Dr. Campbell ROLIAN (Univ.
of Calgary, Canada), has performed articial selection
for increased tibia length in mice (2 \Longshanks" se-
lection lines & 1 control line, >6000 total individuals;
see Marchini et al., 2014). Over 21 generations, the
Longshanks selection experiment has produced 15-20%
increase in tibia length but unchanged body mass rela-
tive to random-bred controls.
Having retained nearly all individuals from the entire
selection experiment, we are now nearly nished with
complete re-sequencing of all available breeders ( ~1800
individuals) in both Longshanks and control lines, with
the ultimate goal of re-tracing the entire selection exper-
iment in every individual, at every locus, in the entire
genome.
You will work with the complete dataset in close coordi-
nation with Prof. Nick BARTON (IST Austria) and his
team to link theory with empirical genomic data. Candi-
dates must have a strong background in bioinformatics,
including experience with genomic data analysis and
strong quantitative and programming skills. Further
background in population genetics and modelling will
be an advantage. The postdoc will work closely with
Prof. BARTON's group, therefore she or he must show
independence and ability to drive her/his own research
project. You will enjoy excellent computational and
sequencing support, as well as the opportunity to design
and conduct functional tests in mice together with our
wet-bench team members.
Our on-going work has found many loci showing veryJune 1, 2017 EvolDir 77
strong response to selection, with a substantial fraction
of parallel response. Further dissection of top loci has
identied specic mutations in limb enhancers. Our
functional test in mice showed that these mutations
modulate enhancer activity in a way consistent with
increased tibia length.
Together with the ROLIAN and BARTON groups, we
will study the selection response from multiple angles,
ranging from trait mapping, population genomics, the-
ory to developmental genetics. The Longshanks selec-
tion experiment combines quantitative, developmental
and population genetics and oers a unique opportunity
to study how the genome responds to strong selection
in a model paradigm.
The Max Planck Campus in T ubingen, Germany is one
of the leading campuses in evolutionary genomics re-
search. The Chan Lab enjoys generous funding support
by the Max Planck Society as well as the European
Research Council (ERC). Our campus hosts world-class
research groups, including a Nobel laureate and multi-
ple ERC-funded teams (groups active in evolutionary
genomics include Felicity Jones, Detlef Weigel, Ralf
Sommer and Ruth Ley). We operate state-of-the-art

Postdoctoral position in Experimental Evolution with
Yeast at Stockholm University, Sweden.
Project: Adaption in stressful environments
Host: Rike Stelkens Start date: September 2017 (nego-
tiable) Application date: June 15 2017
Description: Candidates will use experimental evolution
with the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (and
its relatives) as model organism to study evolutionary
processes. The overall aim of the project is to develop
an empirical system for studying adaptation in rapidly
changing and stressful environments - a major challenge
falling within the nexus of evolutionary genetics and
conservation biology. Potential topics include but are
not limited to 1) the eects of hybridization on rates
and mechanisms of adaptation, 2) the genomic basis of
hybrid tness, and 3) the genomic basis of reproductive
isolation.
Qualications: I am looking for people with a strong
interest in evolution, especially in speciation and conser-
vation genetics. Ideally, you have experience in experi-
mental evolution methods, molecular genetics/genomics
techniques, bioinformatics, and you have knowledge of
the principles of population and quantitative genetics
and genomics. Prior training in Saccharomyces yeast
cultivation are highly desirable. Candidates should be
well-organized, good communicators, and happy to workin a team as well as independently. You must have a
PhD in evolutionary biology, population genetics, or a
similar subject. You should also have a strong desire
to develop a successful and highly productive research
career.
Environment: The campus is located four metro stops
from the center of Stockholm, one of the most beautiful
and dynamic capitals in Europe. The campus is home to
a vibrant scientic community, including the Science for
Life Laboratory (a leading genomics core facility that
we routinely use) and the Swedish Museum of Natural
History. Sweden is a free and open society, and strives
to be one of the world's most innovative and research-

StatisticalGenetics
We are inviting applications for a Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Statistical Genetics or related elds to
work on the project: Investigating the Parental Role in
Autism Spectrum Disorder through Rare and Common
Sources of Variation.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder that is known to be heritable. The disorder
aects approximately 1% of the population and presents
signicant challenges for those aected and their fam-
ilies. ASD is not caused by a single gene mutation,
but rather the eects of a number of genes contribute
to the disorder. In the majority of cases though, no
genetic cause has been identied. In general, when ge-netic material is passed from parents to their ospring
the material functions regardless of its parental origin,
but in some instances this is not the case and how the
genetic material behaves is dependent on its parental
origin. Evidence suggests that these parent-of-origin
eects are present in ASD and the aim of this project
is to investigate these eects.
Advances in technology have resulted in Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) data becoming available
that consists of both rare and common sources of varia-
tion in the genome. This data oers promising avenues
for identication of the underlying genetic causes of
ASD. Through an investigation of rare and common
sources of parent-of-origin eects, we will explore the
parental genetic role in ASD. In this project Bayesian
statistical methods, that can incorporate prior informa-
tion, will be developed to investigate rare and common
inherited variation for parent-of-origin eects. These
statistical methods will be applied to selected regions
of the genome in ASD NGS datasets in order to further
the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying
ASD. This research has the potential to shed light on
the missing heritability in ASD and ultimately oer
insights into the genetic causes of ASD which will help
improve ASD diagnoses and lead to advances in treat-
ments. See also: https://jobs.tcd.ie/ Candidate The
ideal candidate will have, or be about to be awarded, a
PhD in statistical genetics, biostatistics, bioinformatics,
computational biology or a related discipline together
with previous experience in developing and applying
Bayesian statistical models and handling large datasets.
The successful candidate will join a highly interdisci-
plinary team in the Dept. of Psychiatry, Trinity College
Dublin.
Duration and Salary The position is for a duration of 15
months. Starting salary at IUA Postdoctoral Researcher
Level 2, Point 1, gross salary: 33,975 euro.

UArizona HostParasite
New Postdoc positions in host-parasite coevolution in
the Schlenke Lab at the University of Arizona
Position summary: The Schlenke Lab studies host-
parasite interactions using Drosophila (fruit ies) as
model hosts. We are developing parasitoid wasps, which
lay their eggs in y larvae and consume their hosts
from the inside out, as model parasites. Flies mount
cellular and behavioral defense responses against wasps,
but wasps have adaptations for nding host y larvae,
suppressing host cellular immunity, and manipulating
host behavior. We use a variety of \omics" tools to un-
derstand the molecular genetics of y cellular immunity
and wasp virulence, as well as patterns of host immunity
and pathogen virulence coevolution across y and wasp
phylogenies. For more information, visit our lab web-
site at: https://cals.arizona.edu/research/schlenke/ We
have current NSF and NIH funding, as well as startup
from UA. We are looking to hire at least two new highly
motivated, creative, and collaborative postdocs to work
on this system. Our lab attempts to understand the y-
wasp interaction at multiple biological levels, and thus
we are searching for candidates with diverse expertise,
such as in evolutionary ecology, genetics, molecular and
cell biology, immunology, neurobiology, and/or bioinfor-
matics. Our lab is based at the University of Arizona
in the Department of Entomology and the positions
are available immediately. Feel free to contact Todd
(schlenke@email.arizona.edu) with questions.
Duties and Responsibilities: Postdocs will be involved
in all aspects of the research, from developing project
ideas to experimental design to data analysis to publi-
cation. Although we have funding for these positions,
postdocs will be expected to apply for their own funding
as well. Postdocs will interact with and mentor graduate
and undergraduate students, and will be involved in lab
outreach activities. In regular consultation with Todd,
postdocs will pursue a plan to enhance their professional
growth and meet their future career goals.
Minimum qualications: Ph.D. in a biological or com-
putational subject. Good writing, communication, and
critical thinking skills.
Preferred qualications: Experience studying:
Drosophila or other insects, host-parasite interactions,
behavior, cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology

University of Lausanne, Switzerland
(This is a are-posting of an earlier ad. The was a prob-
lem with the link for uploading applications; the link at
the bottom of this message should work now.)
We are seeking a postdoc to work on a two-year project
on the evolution of combined versus separate sexes
(hermaphroditism vs. dioecy) and sexual dimorphism in
owering plants. The scope of the project can be tailored
to the successful candidate's interests and expertise, but
will likely involve genome and transcriptome analysis of:
(1) experimental populations of an annual plant species
that have undergone a rapid transition between dioecy
and hermaphroditism; and (2) natural populations of
several dioecious species that vary strongly in their ex-
pression of secondary sexual dimorphism. The project
start date is somewhat exible but is envisaged for 1
October, 2017.
The postdoc would join a team postdocs and PhD stu-
dents working on aspects of sexual-system evolution in
plants, with a current focus on sex-chromosome evolu-
tion and the evolution of sex allocation and sexually
antagonistic traits. Details of the lab can be found
at: http://www.unil.ch/dee/home/menuinst/research/-
pannell-group.html The postdoc would have excellent
opportunities for collaborations and discussions with
the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, which has three
groups within the department; see:
http://www.unil.ch/dee/home/menuinst/research.html
The ideal candidate should have: (1) a passionate inter-
est (and PhD) in evolutionary biology and population
genetics; (2) experience and skills in the generation and
analysis of genomic and transcriptomic NGS data; and
(3) excellent communication skills. Experience and an
interest in working with plants could be an advantage;
however, while there will be some opportunity for eld
work in the Iberian Peninsula and/or South Africa in-
volving work with plants, it is anticipated that most
of the work will involve hypothesis testing based on
sequence analysis.
The postdoc would be appointed for an initial period of
one year, renewable for two years assuming satisfactoryJune 1, 2017 EvolDir 93
progress, and with the eventual possibility of renewal
for a total of up to 5 years.
The Department of Ecology and Evolution has a lively
intellectual and social life. Although the University
of Lausanne is Francophone, the department is highly
international, and all its research activity and, e.g., sem-
inars are conducted in English. The city is culturally
rich and occupies a beautiful setting on the shores of
Lake Geneva, very close to the Swiss and French Alps.
Informal enquiries for further details of the aims
of the project should be sent to John Pannell

Applications are invited for two post-doctoral re-
searchers to join the Statistical Genomics Group in
the Centre for Systems Genomics, University of Mel-
bourne, headed by Associate Professor Stephen Leslie.
The group's work focuses on methodological develop-
ments for the analysis of high throughput genetic data
and the application of these methods to studies of dis-
ease and natural population variation. These methods
typically combine modern computationally-intensive sta-
tistical approaches with insights from population genet-
ics models. Specically the group works on statistical
methods for imputing immune system (and other) genes
from incomplete genetic data; the application of these
methods to studies of autoimmune and other diseases;methods for detecting and controlling for population
stratication; and understanding the causes and conse-
quences of genetic variation in populations. The group
has strong established collaborations with the Donnelly
and McVean groups at the Wel lcome Trust Centre for
Human Genetics in Oxford.
The positions involve working on problems at the cut-
ting edge of human genetics, and represent an exciting
opportunity for a statistical geneticist, or someone with
a strong statistical background and skills wishing to
move into this eld. The successful applicants will focus
on developing methods to type HLA, KIR and other im-
mune system related loci from genomic data. They will
further apply these methods to studies of auto-immune
and other disease, with a particular focus on psoria-
sis. They will work directly on projects arising from
the collaboration between the Leslie group and A/Prof.
Wilson Liao at UCSF, investigating the role of HLA and
KIR in psoriasis. The appointees will also contribute
to the group's other research projects as directed by
A/Prof. Leslie. They will be encouraged to develop
their independent research projects where appropriate,
as long as they are generally consistent with the research
priorities of the Leslie group and the Centre for Systems
Genom ics as a whole.
We are seeking highly motivated scientists, with a PhD
in statistics or a closely related area. Applications are
encouraged from people who can demonstrate a strong
statistical or other quantitative background and wish
to move into statistical genetics research. Ideally you
will have experience of genetic analyses but this is not
essential. You must have considerable programming
experience with a low level language (e.g. C, C++) and
preferably also with the statistical software R. The suc-
cessful applicants will have an aptitude for visualizing
data, problem solving and careful statistical analysis.
They should be able to work alone and collaboratively,
and be able to digest and communicate scientic ideas
eectively. The positions are available for three years.
The Research Fellows will be located in the Centre for
Systems Genomics, a joint initiative of the Faculty of Sci-
ence and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health
Sciences. The positions will report to A/Prof. Stephen
Leslie, Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics, and
the appointees will be part of the Leslie Group.

MicrobialPopulationGenomics
Postdoctoral Researcher University of Pennsylvania, De-
partment of Biology
The Evolution and Ecology of Disease Systems labo-
ratory at the University of Pennsylvania is searching
for a postdoctoral researcher to enable microbial
population genomics by advancing the selective whole
genome amplication (SWGA) protocol development
pipeline. Microbial population genomic research is
often hindered by the practicalities of obtaining samples
with sucient amounts of relatively pure microbial
genomic DNA for next-generation sequencing. The
goals of this project are to reduce the technical barriers
that currently prevent researchers from collecting
populations of whole genome sequences from microbes
by developing an ecient selective whole genome
amplication (SWGA) development pipeline that can
create SWGA protocols to rapidly and cheaply amplify
the genome of any focal microbial species, even if the
focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule
fraction of the sample (which often contains contam-
inating DNA from the host and other organisms).
For more information on SWGA, see: https://-
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28190880 https://-
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334194 https://-
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804174/
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25096321 The
main duties of the postdoctoral researcher will be
designing and troubleshooting advanced molecular tools,
processing and analyzing next generation sequence
data including quality control and bioinformatics, and
interfacing with computer scientists to identify criteria
that can improve protocol ecacy. The ideal candidate
should have experience designing and troubleshooting
advanced molecular protocols, working with genomic
data, and have enthusiasm for evolutionary based
questions. This post is part of a larger project on
the population genomics of microbial pathogens that
includes researchers at Penn and other universities98 EvolDir June 1, 2017
around the world.
The Department of Biology has a long-standing tradition
of maintaining an integrated research and educational
program across all basic biological sciences including
Ecology and Evolution, Plant Sciences, Molecular and
Cellular Biology, Genomics, and Neuroscience. The De-
partment values interdisciplinary research, collaboration,
and collegiality, emphasizing Life in its Natural Context.
The University of Pennsylvania has a strong group of
evolutionary biologists that frequently interact with each
other and with an accomplished group of microbiologists
in the Medical and Veterinary schools. Unlikely many
universities, the proximity of the medical, veterinary,
and arts and science schools are centrally located on
the Philadelphia campus, which promotes a cross-talk
and collaboration. The University of Pennsylvania is
an equal opportunity employer. Minorities, women, in-
dividuals with disabilities, and protected veterans are
encouraged to apply.
The position is available as early as Summer 2017.
Salary is commensurate with experience based on the
NIH guidelines.

Postdoctoral researcher in metagenomics and compara-
tive genomics of archaea
Uppsala University, Department of Cell and Molecular
Biology
Uppsala University is an international research univer-
sity focused on the development of science and education.
Our most important assets are all the individuals who
with their curiosity and their dedication make UppsalaUniversity one of Sweden's most exciting work places.
Uppsala University has 40,000 students, 7,000 employees
and a turnover of SEK 6,5 billion.
A postdoctoral researcher position is available at Upp-
sala University in the group of Dr. Anja Spang, which is
based at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology
(Uppsala University, Sweden). The position, which is
funded by a VR starting grant (to Anja Spang), is of-
fered for a two-year period. The postdoc will be part of
the research team of Associate Professor Thijs Ettema
(see http://www.ettemalab.org/) at Uppsala University.
Dr. Spang has a key interest in the role of symbiosis in
the evolution of life on Earth ranging from the origin of
the eukaryotic cell to symbiotic relationships between
dierent extant microbial groups, such as syntrophic
and symbiotic interactions involving archaeal partners.
Therefore, a particular focus of her current research
lies in the study of the evolution, cell biology, ecology
and phylogenetic diversity of archaea aliating with
the tentative DPANN superphylum, which comprises
lineages with extremely small genomes and cell sizes.
Metagenomics, comparative genomics and phylogenomic
approaches have proven extremely useful to reconstruct
genomes of the uncultivated microbial majority and
comparatively analyze their genomic potential and evo-
lution. In this regard, advanced bioinformatics and data
science based approaches are increasingly necessary to
adequately analyze the vast amount of genomic data,
that has recently been generated.
Duties: The project is focused on the development and
use of novel metagenomics approaches including sophis-
ticated binning methodologies, that will allow to ob-
tain highly complete, non-redundant genomes of deep-
branching archaea aliating with the DPANN super-
phylum. In addition, sophisticated phylogenomic and
comparative approaches, will be applied and further
developed to model genome evolution (and reduction)
in the archaea.
Qualications required: The successful applicant has a
Ph.D. in computational biology, bioinformatics, phyloge-
nomics, microbial genomics, molecular and/or evolution-
ary biology or related elds, and should preferably have
knowledge and experience in high throughput genomic
technologies including metagenomics. Experience in the
use of the command line and Unix as well as in the ap-
plication of programming languages such as R, Python
and/or Perl are required. Finally, good command of
English, spoken as well as written, is a prerequisite.
Applicants should have completed their doctorate within
three years before the application deadline. If there are
special reasons, Ph.D.June 1, 2017 EvolDir 99
may have been awarded previously. Special reasons
include leave of absence due to illness, parental leave,
etc. The application must include three named referees
with the necessary contact details, a Curriculum Vitae,
a motivation letter (1 page) and a description of your
past research (1 page).
For further information about the position contact Anja
Spang (anja.spang@icm.uu.se). Please submit your ap-
plication by 30th of May 2017, UFV-PA 2017/1421.

Dear all,
we still have a few spots left for the course \Introduction
to Linux and workows for biologists".
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course1/
Dates: 31 July-4 August 2017
Application deadline is: June 30th, 2017 (rst-come,
rst-served)
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
Biologists).
Martin started his programming career by learning
Perl during the course of his PhD in evolutionary
biology, and started teaching other people to program
soon after. He is author of two text books, Python
for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/Python-
Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/dp/-
1492346136/] and Advanced Python for Biologists
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/] . Overview
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lifting
genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation tools
are designed to work best when used with a command-
line interface. Because the command line can be an
intimidating environment, many biologists learn the
bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools work-
ing. This means that they miss out on the power of
Linux to customize their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.
Intended audienceJune 1, 2017 EvolDir 105
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology who want to learn
to use the Linux operating system and the command
line environment. No previous experience of Linux is
required.
Course Programme
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course1/-
curriculum/ Monday 31th - Classes from 09:30 to
17:30
Session 1 - The design of Linux
In the rst session we briey cover the design of Linux:
how is it dierent from Windows/OSX and how is it
best used? We'll then jump straight onto the command
line and learn about the layout of the Linux lesystem
and how to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's le per-
mission system (which often trips up beginners), how
paths work, and how we actually run programs on the
command line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the
command line more eciently, and how to deal with
programs that are misbehaving. We'll nish this session
by looking at the built in help system and how to read
and interpret manual pages.
Session 2 - System management
We'll rst look at a few command line tools for mon-
itoring the status of the system and keeping track of
what's happening to processor power, memory, and disk
space. We'll go over the process of installing new soft-
ware from the built in repositories (which is easy) and
from source code downloads (which is trickier). We'll
also introduce some tools for benchmarking software
(measuring the time/memory requirements of processing
large datasets).
Tuesday 1sh - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3 - Manipulating tabular data
Many data types we want to work with in bioinformat-
ics are stored as tabular plain text les, and here we
learn all about manipulating tabular data on the com-
mand line. We'll start with simple things like extracting
columns, ltering and sorting, searching for text before
moving on to more complex tasks like searching for du-
plicated values, summarizing large les, and combining
simple tools into long commands.
Session 4 - Constructing pipelines
In this session we will look at the various tools Linux has
for constructing pipelines out of individual commands.
Aliases, shell redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will
all be introduced here. We'll also look at a couple of
specic tools to help with running tools on multiple pro-
cessors, and for monitoring the progress of long runningtasks.
Wednesday 2nd - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 5 - EMBOSS
EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformatics command-line
tools explicitly designed to work in the Linux paradigm.
We'll get an overview of the dierent sequence data
formats that we might expect to work with, and put
what we learned about shell scripting to biological use
by building a pipeline to compare codon usage across
two collections of DNA sequences.
Session 6 - Using a Linux server
Often in bioinformatics we'll be working on a Linux
server rather than our own computer typically because
we need access to more computing power, or to special-
ized tools and datasets. In this session we'll

Bordeaux Holobionts Nov6-8
Interdisciplinary Workshop on Holobionts November 6-
8, 2017 University of Bordeaux. Bordeaux, France <
https://www.immuconcept.org/holobiont-workshop/ >
Organizers: Derek Skillings and Thomas Pradeu
Microbes play a signicant role in the evolution, develop-
ment, health, and ecological interactions of multicellular
organisms. The importance of microbial interactions
is now widely recognized and at the center of many
new research initiatives across the life sciences. Part
of this emerging research has focused on reconceptual-
izing all macroorganisms as \holobionts", dened as a
host and all its microbial symbionts, with the genomic
complement of all partners becoming the \hologenome".
There has been extensive debate about the importance
and need for such a reconceptualization, and how it
will shape research and our understanding of the living
world moving forward.
This workshop will bring together researchers from di-
verse disciplines (microbiology, evolutionary biology,
ecology, pathology, neuroscience, medicine, philosophy)
working on holobionts and host-microbe associations, in
order to foster interdisciplinary communication, investi-
gate whether there are any particular insights or fruitful
general principles that emerge from investigations across
elds, and hopefully stimulate collaborative research for
the future.
If you would like to participate by giving a talk, please
submit an abstract or prospectus (up to 1000 words) by
going to the link on the workshop website. Submissions
should be prepared for blind review and uploaded by
the Abstract Deadline: July 16, 2017.
Registration for the workshop by October 1st, 2017
is required, but free. Follow the website for further
updates.

Practical Course on Phylogeography
organized by Octavio Paulo jJuly 3-7 2017 @ Lisbon,
Portugal
Objectives: Phylogeography is one of the recent scientic
areas emergent from the dissemination of highthrouput
technologies of sequencing starting in the 90's of the
XXth century, with the consequent development of intra-
specic genetic variance analysis and its geographic dis-
tribution. The analysis of phylogeographic data allows
to study the processes of population dierentiation and
the underlying evolutionary and demographic history.
Applications of this body of knowledge go from conserva-
tion genetics to the study of the evolution of species and
populations. This course is aimed at students and pro-
fessionals that intend to get started on phylogeographic
analysis as well as researchers already with some experi-
ence that want to deepen or update their knowledge in
the eld. The course involves theoretical classes as well
as hands-on practical sessions using software. Partici-
pants are encouraged to bring their own sequence data
for analysis.
Course instructor Octavio Paulo (oc-
tavio.paulo@fc.ul.pt) Assistant Professor at the
Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon,
researcher at the Centre for Ecology, Evolution and
Environmental Changes (cE3c - http://ce3c.fc.ul.pt/-
), Coordinator of the Computational Biology &
Population Genomics Group (http://cobig2.com)
Intended audience This course will be open to a maxi-
mum number of 20 participants. Minimum formation:
Bachelor in Biology or related area.

ESEB 2017 Satellite Workshop in Groningen: \ESEB
STN - The European Drosophila Population Genomics
Consortium (DrosEU)"
Dear Colleagues:
We would like to kindly invite you to participate in a
satellite discussion workshop on Drosophila population
genomics and evolution, held during the ESEB 2017
meeting in Groningen (16th Congress of the European
Society for Evolutionary Biology, 20-25 August 2017;
Groningen, The Netherlands; http://www.eseb2017.nl).
The workshop will be held on Thursday 24 August in
the afternoon; please see the conference program for
details. The workshop is open to all interested ESEB
participants/evolutionary biologists.
The main aim of the workshop is to present the work
and objectives of the European Drosophila Population
Genomics Consortium (DrosEU), which is funded by
an ESEB Special Topics Network (STN) grant, to the
ESEB/evolutionary biology community and in to dis-
cuss future developments/collaborations in the eld of
Drosophila adaptation genomics.
The DrosEU consortium, founded in 2013, consists of
approx. 70 scientists from Europe and beyond: over the
past few years, we have been sampling and sequencing
a large number of European Drosophila melanogaster
populations through space and time. The overarch-
ing goal of DrosEU is to foster the integration and
exchange of population genomic information and data
in the Drosophila system and to cooperate closely in col-
lecting, generating and analyzing genomic and environ-
mental data for numerous Drosophila populations across
Europe and beyond in order to gain a better understand-ing of adaptation. DrosEU is also closely collaborating
with the US-based Drosophila Real Time Evolution
Consortium (Dros-RTEC) (http://web.sas.upenn.edu/-
paul-schmidt-lab/dros-rtec).

activity/?p28&uid744 DESCRIPTION: Quantitative
Genetics is the analysis of complex characters where
both genetic and environment factors contribute to trait
variation. Since this includes most traits of interest,
such as disease susceptibility, crop yield, growth and
reproduction in animals, human and animal behavior,
and all gene expression data (transcriptome and pro-
teome), a working knowledge of quantitative genetics is
critical in diverse elds from plant and animal breeding,
human genetics, genomics, behavior, to ecology and
evolutionary biology. The course will cover the basics of
quantitative genetics including: genetic basis for com-
plex traits, population genetic assumptions including
detection of admixture, Fisher's variance decomposi-
tion, covariance between relatives, calculation of the
numerator relationship matrix based on IBD alleles and
an arbitrary pedigree, the genomic relationship matrix
based on AIS alleles, heritability in the broad and nar-
row sense, inbreeding and crossbreeding, and response
to selection. Also an introduction to advanced topics

LundU AnimalMigration Oct16-27
Dear all,
We like to announce that on the 16th-27th of October
the two-week long international PhD course in Ecology
of Animal Migration will be held at the Department
of Biology at Lund University, Sweden. Here follows
a short overview of the course. For more information
and registration, please visit the course home page (link
attached further down). Please consider passing this to
interested PhD students.
Overview
Animals move across dierent spatial and temporalscales either as part of their daily life or as part of
seasonal migrations to exploit resources in the environ-
ment. Well known examples are the global scale seasonal
migrations in birds, sea turtles, sh and mammals, such
as whales and wildebeests. Also movements at smaller
scales occur, such as the vertical movements in plank-
ton, the dispersal in soil collembolans and movements of
pollinating insects. But what are the ecological causes
and evolutionary consequences of animal movements?
During this two-week course you will get insight in a
number of dierent methods and approaches to study
the migration of birds, insects, sh, amphibians and
mammals, ranging from experimental studies in the
laboratory to tracking long-distance migration in wild
animals. Lectures will be given by international authori-
ties in the eld as well as by researchers in the CAnMove
Group at Lund University.

shaw@indiana.edu) if you are a non-US citizen or
permanent resident wanting to participate.
The faculty at MDI Biological Lab is pleased to again
oer a training course in Environmental Genomics, aim-
ing to better understand technologies and approaches
used to discover how gene function is inuenced by
environmental conditions while accounting for varia-
tion that exists within and among natural populations.
This course is built on the paradigm that the research
eld will most eectively grow by properly designing
large-scale experiments enabled by drastically increased
sample-throughput and lower sequencing costs. Most
importantly, the bioinformatics challenges of manipulat-
ing and analyzing population-level genomics data must
be addressed.^ a e^ ae
This course is designed to train the next-generation of
environmental scientists, which have included in past
years: university professors, postdoctoral researchers,doctoral students and government scientists, represent-
ing institutions from North America and Europe. Most
responded in the departure survey that the course cur-
riculum, choice of technologies, and eectiveness pro-
vided sucient training to either begin or enlarge an
environmental genomics project in their own labora-
tories. All reported that they would recommend this
course to a colleague.
^ ae^ aeThis course trains researchers to design studies,
and to collect and analyze RNA-Seq gene expression
data. Daphnia is used for training because of its grow-
ing use as a model system for environmental genomics
and for improving environmental health protection, yet
the skills learned during the course will be applicable
to all study systems with maturing genomics resources,
including humans. Much time is devoted to guiding the
current and future projects of attendees.
^ ae^ aeUltimately, participants will be better positioned
to incorporate these technologies into their own research
laboratories, while better understanding how functional
genomics and automation can be applied to ecology,
evolution and environmental toxicology.^ a e

Nov27-Dec1
INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR BIOLOGISTS
http://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-python-for-biologis ts-ipyb04/ This course is being
delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an expert in Python
and author of two text books, Python for Biologists
[http://www.amazon.com/Python-Biologists-complete-
programming-beginners /dp/1492346136/] Advanced
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Advanced-Python-Biologists-Martin-Jones/dp/14952
44377/].
Prices start at ^A £475 and accommodation packages can
be added for an additional ^A £260, includes all meals
and accommodation on site for the week, arrival Sunday
before the course starts) Course overview: Python is a
dynamic, readable language that is a popular platform
for all types of bioinformatics work, from simple one-o
scripts to large, complex software projects. This work-
shop is aimed at complete beginners and assumes no118 EvolDir June 1, 2017
prior programming experience. It gives an overview of
the language with an emphasis on practical problem-
solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various
aspects of bioinformatics work. After completing the
workshop, students should be in a position to (1) apply
the skills they have learned to tackle problems in their
own research and (2) continue their Python education
in a self-directed way.
Intended audience: This workshop is aimed at all re-
searchers and technical workers with a background in
biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus
has been planned with complete beginners in mind; peo-
ple with previous programming experience are welcome
to attend as a refresher but may nd the pace a bit
slow.
Teaching format: The workshop is delivered over ten
half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organizer's discretion. There will also be plenty
of time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum:
Monday 27th Module 1: Introduction.
We will start with a general introduction to Python and
explain why it is useful and how learning to program
can benet your research. Some time will be taken
to explain the format of the course. We will outline
the edit-run-x cycle of software development and talk
about how to avoid common text editing errors. In this
session, we also check that the computing infrastructure
for the rest of the course is in place.^ a eCore concepts in-
troduced: source code; text editors; whitespace; syntax
and syntax error; and Python versions.
Module 2: Output and text manipulation.
This session will show students how to write very sim-
ple programs that produce output to the terminal and
in doing so become comfortable with editing and run-
ning Python code. This session also introduces many
of the technical terms that we'll rely on in future ses-
sions. We will run through some examples of tools for
working with text and show how they work in the con-text of biological sequence manipulation. We also cover
dierent types of errors and error messages and learn
how to go about xing them methodically.^ a eCore con-
cepts introduced: terminals; standard output; variables
and naming;^ a estrings and characters; special charac-
ters; output formatting; statements; functions; methods;
arguments; comments.
Tuesday 28th
Module 3: File IO and user interfaces.
We will discuss about the importance of les in bioin-
formatics pipelines and workows during this session,
and we then explore the Python interfaces for reading
from and writing to les. This involves introducing
the idea of types and objects and a bit of discussion
about how Python interacts with the operating system.
The practical session is spent combining the techniques
from session 2 with the le IO tools to create basic le-
processing scripts.^ a eCore concepts introduced: objects
and classes; paths and folders; relationships between
variables and values; text and binary les; newlines.
Module 4: Flow control 1: loops.
A discussion of the limitations of the techniques learned
in session 3 quickly reveals that ow control is required
to write more sophisticated le-processing programs, at
this point we will progress on to the concept of loops.
We look at the way in which Python loops

Ecological niche modelling using R (ENMR01)
Delivered by Dr. Neftali Sillero
http://www.prstatistics.com/course/ecological-niche-
modelling-using-r-enmr01/ This course will run from
16th - 20th October 2017 at SCENE eld station, Loch
Lomond national park, Scotland
Applying niche modelling to the eld of evolutionary
biology has increased in recent years. It is especially
important for eld of ecological speciation, sympatric
speciation, resource specialisation and studying how or-
ganisms and traits may evolve/cope with rapid changesJune 1, 2017 EvolDir 119
to the environment such as those caused by climate
change.
Ecological niche, species distribution, habitat distribu-
tion, or climatic envelope models are dierent names
for similar mechanistic or correlative models, empiri-
cal or mathematical approaches to the ecological niche
of a species, where dierent types of ecogeographical
variables (environmental, topographical, human) are
related with a species physiological data or geograph-
ical locations, in order to identify the factors limiting
and dening the species' niche. ENMs have become
popular due to the need for eciency in the design and
implementation of conservation management.
The course will cover the base theory of ecological niche
modelling and its main methodologies. By the end
of this 5-day practical course, attendees will have the
capacity to perform ecological niche models and under-
stand their results, as well as to choose and apply the
correct methodology depending on the aim of their type
of study and data.
The course will be mainly practical, with some theoret-
ical lectures. All modelling processes and calculations
will be performed with R, the free software environment
for statistical computing and graphics (http://www.r-
project.org/). Attendees will learn to use modelling
algorithms like Maxent, Bioclim, Domain, and logistic
regressions, and R packages for computing ENMs like
Dismo and Biomod2. Also, students will learn to com-
pare dierent ecological niche models using the Ecospat
package.
Course content is as follows
Monday 16th Elementary concepts on Ecological Niche

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.June 1, 2017 EvolDir 121
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
