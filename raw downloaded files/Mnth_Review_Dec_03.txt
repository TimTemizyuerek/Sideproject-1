Australasian Evolution Society Meeting in Wollongong
February 2004
Dear registrants and AES members,
With regret the AES meeting is being transferred to
Adelaide Zoo ( ~April 15th -19th) due to a number of
circumstances beyond the control of the organizers at
Wollongong. My sincere apologies for the inconvenience
to those planning to attend or who have already pre-
pared abstracts. I hope that this will not colour any-
one’s view of the Society. It is entirely a regrettable
local problem.
I know that the change will not suit everyone but we
are fortunate in being able to combine the meeting with
the Australian Society for Animal Behaviour’s Annual
Meeting. Details of the Animal behaviour meeting are
available at http://galliform.bhs.mq.edu.au/ASSAB/-
events/ASSAB4.html . The inclusion of AES will prob-
ably be best achieved by adding a day to the meeting
but this is still in negotiation. More details will follow.

We are pleased to announce the return of the Cali-
fornia Population and Evolutionary Genetics meeting
(CalPEG). CalPEG is a two-day meeting that typically
attracts talks from a wide range of disciplines in ecol-
ogy, behavior, and evolutionary biology. CalPEG is a
great opportunity for post-docs, graduate students and
advanced undergraduates to present their research in a
relatively low-key setting, and it is the perfect environ-
ment for more established scientists to test-drive their
latest crazy idea. This year, the keynote address will be
delivered by Dr. Douglas Wallace (UCI) on “Ancient
origins - Modern diseases: The mtDNA connection”. A
limited number of discounted rooms has been set aside
at the local Travelodge, available on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-
served basis.
We hope to see you there!

Dear Colleague,
We apologize if you receive this e-mail in duplicate, and
we would like to ask you this distribute this information
to potentially interested colleagues.
We are organizing an interdisciplinary conference on
Molecular Evolution to be held in Dresden (Germany),
July 5-10 2004. The conference is sponsored by the
Max-Planck-Institut for the Physics of Complex Sys-
tems.
The goals of molecular evolution can only be accom-
plished by a highly interdisciplinary combination of ex-
perimental techniques of molecular biology, bioinfor-
matics, and mathematical modeling. The increasing
amount of data made available by genome sequenc-
ing projects are demanding an increasing integration
of these disciplines. In particular, progresses in un-
derstanding the structural properties of biological en-
tities at diﬀerent levels, such as molecules, networks,
and populations, can greatly contribute both to eluci-
date the mechanisms of evolution and to reconstruct its
course.
We aim at bringing together people from diﬀerent
scientiﬁc communities working in the following three
main areas: theoretical and empirical studies of pop-
ulation dynamics, computational and experimental
studies of the stability and properties of biological
macromolecules, and statistical analysis of sequences
databases. The synergies between these diﬀerent ap-
proaches are anticipated to improve our understanding
of the processes and pathways of molecular evolution,
and should be pursued further. We hope that our work-
shop helps stimulating this integration and provides a
lively framework for debate and interaction.

Dear colleagues, We are glad to invite you to participate
in the 1st Baikalian Workshop on Evolutionary Biology
with the subject “Tracing Past Environmental Changes
in the Genetic diversity of Contemporary Faunas”
The general idea is to join theoretical biologists, mod-
ellers, bioinformatics people and molecular biologists to
extract new information from phylogenies that would
allow one to infer how the evolutionary histories of
species was aﬀected by past environmental changes.
The emergence of new methods to infer the demo-
graphic histories of organisms from molecular phyloge-
nies allows one to address how environmental changes
may have impacted the origin and the evolutionary his-
tories of species and their populations. In view of the
growing interest to describe, understand and predict
the consequences of the present anthropogenic global
climate changes on global biodiversity, we suggest that
the possibility to use phylogenetic information to ac-
count for the impact of environmental changes on pat-
terns of diversiﬁcation in species and populations mayDecember 1, 2003 EvolDir 5
become an important and new approach. Whereas the
demographic consequences of environmental change are
usually studied below the species level, the phylogenetic
approach enables to investigate if and how environmen-
tal changes have resulted in increased (or decreased)
rates of diversiﬁcation (speciation ><extinction). By
exploring the available, and newly emerging methods to
link phylogenic information to environmental and biotic
factors (inﬂuence of the presence of other organisms in
a particular eco-system) this meeting intends to bridge
the gap between theoretical ecology, population genet-
ics and phylogenetics by exploring how molecular phy-
logenies, may allow one to investigate the importance
of environmental change on the rate of evolutionary di-
versiﬁcation in groups of related species.

Synopsis: We wish to announce a symposium to be
sponsored by the AFS Genetics Section and held at the
AFS 134th Annual Meeting on August 22-26 in Madi-
son, Wisconsin. This symposium is intended for 1.5
days (approximately 25 presentations of 20 min. du-
ration), and will address genetic research in a variety
of areas that seeks to understand the eﬀects of hu-
man activities on the aquatic environment, with spe-
cial emphasis on the Great Lakes. The magnitude of
these impacts is increasing at an alarming rate. Species
and populations that have evolved means of coping and
thriving within the environments they inhabit are con-
fronted with anthropogenically induced selection pres-
sures that are unprecedented in geographic scale and in-
tensity. Better understanding of patterns of genetic and
phenotypic variation within and among natural popula-
tions, of the ways that human activity aﬀects these pat-
terns, and of the means organisms have to respond to
changing selection pressures will improve managers’ de-
cision making. Increasingly, molecular technology and
methods of analyses provide a means to assess and pre-
dict risks to the viability of ﬁsh resources and aquatic
communities. This symposium seeks to bring together
researchers who are working at the forefront of these
ﬁelds.
The symposium is tentatively organized into three sec-
tions. The ﬁrst section will outline our current under-
standing of the evolutionary processes that underlie ex-
isting genetic and phenotypic diversity. Topics will in-
clude history of colonization and radiation, patterns of
population genetic diversity, comparative phylogeogra-
phy, and the role of systematics in deﬁnition of evolu-
tionary units and management units, and the genetic
basis of adaptive variation.
The second section will focus on anthropogenic eﬀects
on aquatic populations that can be resolved via molec-
ular or quantitative/heritable variation in phenotypic
data. Topics will include introduced species, disease,
climate change and environmental tolerance, eﬀects of
genotype and potential for evolutionary response to
large-scale environmental variation, evolutionary eﬀects
of harvest, eﬀects of hatchery ﬁsh on genetic diversity
and ﬁtness of wild stocks, eﬀects of pollution, environ-
mental stressors, and hybridization. Examples will be
drawn from the Great Lakes and elsewhere.The third section will discuss emerging genetic ap-
proaches to detect evolutionary change and agents.
Topics will include molecular approaches to quantita-
tive genetic problems, genomics, bioinformatics, gene
mapping and candidate genes, QTL, biological control,
and emerging computational approaches.
We intend to propose the symposium to AFS by their
deadline of December 18, 2003. Therefore, we ask
those interested in contributing a presentation (talk or
poster) to contact one of us with a tentative title by
December 15, 2003. Anyone interested in serving as a
session chair should also contact us by that date.
Sponsors for the symposium include the Great Lakes
Fishery Commission.

ety, London Cost? Free to all, but registration required
How? Register on-line at www.royalsoc.ac.uk/events
Meeting Summary Continental biomes are the world’s
most biodiverse areas, but little is known about their
history. Molecular phylogenies oﬀer a new means of
dating the origin of plant taxa that form the structural
framework of these ecosystems. This meeting will dis-
cuss the theoretical background to dating phylogenies
and place insights from calibrated plant phylogenies in
a palaeobotanical and ecological context.

Graduate Studentships Plant Evolution and Ecology
I am seeking students interested in pursuing graduate
study (MSc and/or PhD level) in Plant Evolution, Ecol-
ogy and Genetics. Our lab focuses on the genetic basisof ﬁtness variation across heterogeneous habitats.
Study System: We are using the slender wild oat,
Avena barbata, as a study organism, because it oc-
curs as two genotypes associated with contrasting wet
and dry habitats, and which diﬀer in a suite of ecolog-
ical traits related to these habitats. We have crossed
these genotypes and have available 200 recombinant in-
bred lines (RILs). Each RIL is a true breeding line
ﬁxed for a random combination of alleles from the two
parental genotypes. Thus we have a system where (a)10 EvolDir December 1, 2003
it is possible to replicate speciﬁc genotypes across envi-
ronments and experimental treatments, (b) any correla-
tion of traits (e.g., size and ﬁtness) across lines implies a
shared genetic basis for the two traits (c) genetic map-
ping of the genes controlling ecological traits can be
conducted easily.
There are a variety of questions that can be addressed
in this system. Two examples include the following, but
interested students should feel free to suggest others.
Selection on life history variation: The genotypes vary
in the timing of the switch from vegetative to reproduc-
tive growth (days to ﬁrst ﬂower) as well as variation in
allocation to individual oﬀspring (seed size). Both are
key life history traits that are expected to be under
strong selection as well as strong trade-oﬀs. The RILs
provide an excellent system in which to study these is-
sues
Costs and Beneﬁts of Phenotypic Plasticity: Our RIL’s
show considerable plasticity for traits such as root al-
location (typically a very plastic trait in plants), but
moreover, the *degree* of this plasticity shows herita-
ble variation among lines. Therefore, the ﬁtness conse-
quences of diﬀerent levels of plasticity could be studied
within and between environments.
Resources At Dal, students would have access to
- Facilities for DNA genotyping through the shared Ma-
rine Gene Probe Laboratory
- Greenhouse facilities
- Permanent ﬁeld plots in the native habitat (in Cali-
fornia)
Funding is available in support of the research, and stu-
dent stipends can be arranged.

PhD Scholarship - ARC APAI Conservation genetics ofthe little penguin ~23,000 per annum tax-free
Deakin University, in conjunction with its research
partner, Phillip Island Nature Park, has been awarded
a scholarship by the Australian Research Council for a
Doctoral student in conservation genetics of the little
penguin.
The Little Penguin is a unique bird of high tourism and
community appeal. Unfortunately, breeding colonies
are highly susceptible to extinction from localised per-
turbations. The project will provide essential infor-
mation for the development of eﬀective colony-speciﬁc
management plans. It will identify colonies of greatest
extinction risk by determining the extent that they will
be supplemented by immigrants in the event of a de-
cline, and how few individuals produce oﬀspring which
in turn go on to reproduce. The project will also infer
the recent history of colony sizes such that contempo-
rary changes in abundances can be interpreted. DNA-
based techniques will be employed to address these
questions.
The PhD scholarship oﬀers an annual stipend of ap-
proximately $23,000 tax free, for three years (with like-
lihood of a 6 month extension if required), to commence
in 2004. Applicants must be Australian citizens or per-
manent residents (NZ citizens can be accepted pending
approval from the ARC), and should hold a ﬁrst class
honours degree or equivalent qualiﬁcation in a ﬁeld such
as ecology, molecular genetics, conservation biology, or
a related discipline.
The position should be ﬁlled by early 2004.

EmoryU EvolBiol
Dear Prospective Graduate Students and Colleagues:
This “Public Service” message is to let you know that
the Graduate Program in Population Biology, EcologyDecember 1, 2003 EvolDir 11
and Evolution (PBEE) at Emory University is now con-
sidering applications for the fall of 2004. If you are
(or know of) a highly motivated, ambitious and able
student looking for a superb graduate program in pop-
ulation biology, ecology and evolutionary biology, the
hardly cryptic (but sincere) purpose of this message is
to encourage you (or them) to submit an application
to our program. In the ﬁrst weeks of February we will
choose the candidates to bring to Atlanta for interviews,
March 26-28, 2004.
We can train students in a many areas of population
biology, ecology and evolutionary biology. Those areas
in which we have particular strengths (are arguably the
best graduate training program in the country) are: the
ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, and molec-
ular evolution and functional genomics.
The faculty of the PBEE program includes members of
the Departments of Biology, Genetics, Anthropology,
Environmental Studies, Biostatistics, Medicine, Epi-
demiology, International Health, Psychology, and the
Emory Vaccine Center. The PBEE faculty also includes
investigators at the Yerkes National Primate Center
and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), both of which are within an easy (and pleasant)
walking distance from the main campus.
The PBEE program is part of the Division of Biological
and Biomedical Sciences. Students accepted to this, or
other Division programs are guaranteed at least ﬁve
years of support with a competitive annual stipend,
health insurance, and a full tuition waiver.
Emory is located in a posh and tree-lined section of At-
lanta, about ﬁve miles from downtown. For those who
don’t know and/or have northern, Midwestern or West-
ern US prejudices (as many of us once had), Atlanta is a
beautifully wooded and wonderfully cosmopolitan and
liberal (yup) city. It is located in the piedmont of the
Appalachian Mountains about two hours drive from the
high mountains and ﬁve hours from either the Atlantic
or Gulf coasts.

Dear Brian, A Ph.D position is available immediately
in the group of Theoretical Biology in Groningen for
a foreign (non-Dutch) student. The project concerns
modelling of ’Self-organization of social behaviour in
primate societies’. Could you please put the informa-
tion below or of the atachment on the web? Thank you
very much, Charlotte Hemelrijk
PhD position at the University of Groningen, the
Netherlands ’Self-organization of social behaviour in
primate societies’ For insect societies it has been shown
that complex social behaviour may arise from simple
interactions between individuals and their environment
by self-organization. This approach has seldom been
applied to the complex behaviour of primates, because
particularly in primates sophisticated cognition is as-
sumed to underlie complex social behaviour. However,
even in humans, societal phenomena, such as traﬃc
jams, result in part from self-organization. The aim
of the present PhD project is to explain complex so-
cial phenomena of primates and their species speciﬁc
diﬀerences by self-organization. The method is a simu-
lation study (computer models) in which artiﬁcial indi-
viduals are supplied with simple rules and behavioural
phenomena are studied at the level of relationships and
of the group. Using this procedure explanations will
be sought for all kinds of aspects of primate social be-
haviour, ranging from coalition strategies, reconcilia-
tion behaviour, exchange strategies, maternal styles to
migratory behaviour. The aim is to investigate the ex-
tent to which such phenomena may arise as emergent
properties from the interactions among the individuals
and environmental characteristics, such as the distribu-
tion of food, the degree of predator pressure, and the
competitive regime.
We are looking for a foreign (non-Dutch) student with:
- MSc in biology or other relevant discipline - knowledge
of social behaviour of animals (preferably primates) -
knowledge about, and interest in self-organization - ex-
perience with computer programming - ambition to ob-
tain a Ph.D degree within 4 years12 EvolDir December 1, 2003
The position is for four years and expected to lead to
a Ph.D degree. The student will receive a stipend of
1340 Euro per month from the University of Gronin-
gen Foundation. This is suﬃcient for sustaining basic
needs of living. Note that the city of Groningen is an
excellent living place. It is surrounded by a mosaic of
rural and natural landscapes and is well known for its
student friendly atmosphere.

Two NSF-funded graduate positions are available to
work on:
(1) diversity and genome evolution of ciliates (2) phy-
logeography of coastal ciliates
(1) The ﬁrst position focuses on the evolution of cili-
ate genomes, particularly in the class Phyllopharyngea.
This ciliate class includes the bizarre suctorians, a lin-
eage in which adults lack cilia but give ’live birth’ to
ciliated embryos that they ’brood’ in a variety of un-
usual structures. The project aims to use multigene
genealogies to assess relationships, and to further char-
acterize genome processing within this class.
(2) A second position is available to work on the phy-
logeography of coastal ciliates, focusing on members
of the class Spirotrichea. The aims of this project
are to describe the diversity of coastal ciliates using
both molecular and morphological approaches. Meth-
ods include light microscopy and silver staining, gene
sequencing, ﬁeld work and bioinformatics.

/ HABITAT MODELING)
The successful candidates will participate in a Euro-
pean project, which starts January 1, 2004, that studies
the diversity of plants at the genetic and ﬂoristic level
in the Alps, and searches for explanatory variables as
surrogates of biodiversity by modeling habitat diver-
sity. The focal areas for the two dissertations, which
are tightly linked, are (1) molecular genetic diversity of
several Alpine plant species (AFLPs) and (2) species
richness and habitat diversity modeling based on avail-
able ﬂoristic data and biophysical variables. In collab-
oration with the EU partners, and co-ordinated by the
team of WSL, the combined data sets of all project
participants will be analyzed.
The positions require (1) a strong background in the
analysis of population genetic data and in population
biology, as well as skills in lab work, or (2) experience
in programming, GIS, modeling, and handling of large
data sets. A good knowledge in the Alpine ﬂora is
highly advantageous. Both candidates should be will-
ing to carry out ﬁeld work in rugged terrain and to
collaborate in a motivated team.
Our institute oﬀers a well-equipped molecular labora-
tory (automatic sequencer, robotic pipeting station). A
high-capacity IT network, work stations and software,
as well as an excellent logistic support, are provided.

The University of Edinburgh is introducing a new Post-
graduate Programme in the Evolution of Language and
Cognition. Students will tackle the key questions that
are at the heart of the recent renaissance in the scientiﬁc
study of the origins and evolution of human language
and cognition.
The programme consists of two components: an inter-
disciplinary 1 year taught Masters degree, and a su-
pervised PhD. Students will apply for one of the other
degree, depending on background and experience. The
MSc year can be used as preparation for the PhD.
Human evolution is a topic for cognitive scientists, psy-
chologists, linguists, archaeologists, anthropologists, bi-
ologists, and computer scientists. Because of this, the
postgraduate programme will suit students from a wide
range of backgrounds. If you are interested in learning
more about the evolution of human cognition and lan-
guage, and about the many disciplines that contribute
to its study, we’d like to hear from you.
We are now accepting applications for entry to the MSc
in September 2004, and for entry to the PhD at any
time.
To ﬁnd out more about the course, and what it will be
like to live and work in Edinburgh, go to our website.
Here you will also ﬁnd full details about how to apply.

(CEES) has a vacancy for a full-time PhD position:
Project: oﬀspring ﬁtness and sex speciﬁc dispersal (va-
cancy nr. 203276)
Organization This PhD project is part of a large re-
search grant on Sex-speciﬁc reproductive tactics: ﬁt-
ness consequences of avian sex allocation and dispersalstrategies granted to Prof. Jan Komdeur by the Dutch
Organisation of Scientiﬁc research (NWO). The project
aims to understand why young birds disperse to other
places, while others stay at home. These dispersal deci-
sions have important consequences for the ﬁtness of the
individual, as well as for the local population dynamics.
The ﬁtness consequences of such decisions may depend
on social circumstances, such as local competitor den-
sity and dispersal decisions of other individuals in the
population. This project is unique in its large scale and
new experimental approach. The PhD will be part of
the VICI group of Prof. Jan Komdeur, which is part
of the Animal Ecology Group. The PhD will be super-
vised by Komdeur, Tinbergen and Both.
Job Description This project adult birds of either sex
will be determined over their whole life. The project in-
cludes a large amount of ﬁeld work, ranging from stan-
dard nest box checks, taking blood samples, catching
and ringing, following individuals with radio transmit-
ters.
Requirements Candidates must have a degree in biol-
ogy, with specialisation in ecology, and a driverˆ as li-
cense. We are looking for an enthusiast researcher with
ample experience in ﬁeld research on birds. Theoretical
interest in evolutionary ecological research is a prereq-
uisite.

VrijeU Phenotypic plasticity
The Department of Animal Ecology of the Institute for
Ecological Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit in Amster-
dam has a vacancy for a full-time Ph.D.-position:
Functional variation in phenotypic plasticity
This Ph.D.-position is part of a large research grant
“The evolution of plastic traits: from genes to ﬁtness”
awarded to Dr. Jacintha Ellers by the Dutch Organi-
sation of Scientiﬁc research (NWO).
Phenotypic plasticity allows animals to adapt their
physiology, morphology and life history to changes in
the environment over their lifetime. One of the most
important environmental factors is temperature, es-
pecially for ectotherms, whose body temperature and
metabolism is highly dependent on the external tem-
perature. However, there are large diﬀerences in the re-
sponse of life history traits to temperature both among18 EvolDir December 1, 2003
and within species. This research aims to explain the
variation in phenotypic plasticity at a mechanistic as
well as an evolutionary level, and investigate the eﬀect
of phenotypic plasticity on population divergence and
speciation. The present PhD project focuses on phe-
notypic plasticity in life history traits in the springtail
Orchesella cincta and will include both laboratory and
ﬁeld experiments. The major aims are to determine
the genetics of plasticity using breeding experiments
and molecular tools, to quantify the adaptive value of
plasticity and to measure selection on temperature plas-
ticity in diﬀerent habitats in the ﬁeld.
Requirements - MSc in Biology with specialisation in
ecology or evolutionary biology - Theoretical interest
in evolutionary ecology research - Excellent experimen-
tal skills, both in ﬁeld research and in experimenta-
tion with small invertebrate animals - Experience with
molecular techniques (DNA extraction, PCR, sequenc-
ing) is recommended - Motivation and ambition to ob-
tain a Ph.D. degree within four years
Conditions of employment The position is for four years
and expected to lead to a Ph.D degree. The student will
receive a gross salary of 1683 Euro per month in the ﬁrst
year, increasing to 2394 Euro per month in the fourth
year. A training programme is part of the position.
Application If you are interested in this position, please
submit your application with curriculum vitae, list of
publications, a summary of research interests, and mo-
tivation for this project before December 16, 2003 to:

CornellU EvolStatGenomics
Dear colleagues,
We still have another week before search committees
start meeting to go through applications, and I wanted
to remind you of some opportunities at Cornell in the
area of evolutionary genomics. For people with an inter-December 1, 2003 EvolDir 23
est in empirical studies, there is a junior faculty opening
in Population Genetics/Evolutionary Genomics in my
department (Molecular Biology & Genetics). For those
more statistically inclined, there is a position in Sta-
tistical Genomics in the department with Carlos Bus-
tamante and Rasmus Nielsen (Biological Statistics and
Computational Biology). If you have experience in hu-
man genetics, the department of Nutritional Sciences
has a position in human population genetics and a ﬁrst-
rate set of epidemiologically oriented colleagues. There
are other genomics positions open here, but those are
the ones whose primary focus is evolutionary genetics.
We have an exceptional environment for pursuing evo-
lutionary genomics here at Cornell. Besides a terriﬁc
list of colleagues, there are mechanisms for graduate
and postdoctoral research that truly succeed in fos-
tering deep and meaningful cross-disciplinary research.
Graduate students are recruited through a variety of
overlapping ﬁelds, including Ecology & Evolutionary
Biology, Genetics & Development, and Computational
Biology (new), and the system here succeeds well in
giving students and postdocs a sense that they can get
concrete input from people campus wide. Some of the
evolutionary genomics faculty include:
Chip Aquadro - Drosophila molecular population ge-
netics Ed Buckler - genetic and molecular analysis of
complex traits in maize Carlos Bustamante - statis-
tical inference from genome-scale data Andy Clark -
molecular population genetics of Drosophila and hu-
mans Jeﬀ Doyle - molecular phylogenetics of plants
Rick Durrett - mathematical modeling of evolutionary
processes Rick Harrison - population genetics of adap-
tation; hybrid zones Steve Kresovich - analysis of plant
genomic diversity Brian Lazzaro - molecular population
genetics of Drosophila and Anopheles Susan McCouch
- rice population genetics/genomics Rasmus Nielsen -
statistical inference in molecular evolution and popula-
tion genetics Steve Tanksley - genomic organization of
quantitative variation in Solanaceae Mariana Wolfner
- comprehensive analysis of accessory gland proteins in
Drosophila
Mammalian genomics is very strong here, with David
Lin, Mike Kotlikoﬀ, Teresa Gunn and John Schimenti
(arriving from Jackson Lab) pursuing genomic ap-
proaches in mouse biology, and Greg Acland, Rory
Todhunter and others pursuing dog genomics through
extensive pedigrees initiated with wide interbreed out-
crosses. In the plant sciences, June Nasrallah is con-
tinuing to make exciting breakthroughs in the molecu-
lar basis of self-incompatibility and retains a strong in-
terest in evolutionary aspects of SI. Maureen Hansen’s
work on RNA editing has intriguing evolutionary as-
pects.In computer science, the primary strength lies in anal-
ysis of protein structure (Ron Elber), including ap-
plications of computational geometry to evolutionary
changes in protein structure. The expertise in pep-
tide threading methods has lead to signiﬁcant progress
for June Nasrallah’s and Mariana Wolfner’s groups.
Golan Yona works on the classiﬁcation structure of the
global proteome, and he is a deep resource for machine
learning approaches to mining genome data. Uri Ke-
ich works on word-structure of genomes, which has ap-
plications for motif ﬁnding, megablast searching, etc..
Many of us in genomics are making extensive use of
the Cornell High Performance Computing group’s clus-
ter, which recently exceeded 1 teraﬂop and houses more
than 2400 nodes.
There is a wonderful concentration of people focusing
on the theory of network structures, and I had an inspir-
ing time at a colloquium last year that featured Steve
Strogatz, Jon Kleinberg, and James Thorp, all Cornell
faculty who are big names in network theory.
To make the process simple, just email your package
(CV, research statement) to me and we will make sure
your application gets to the right place. It is quite
easy to be considered by multiple searches here, because
these genomics searches are coordinated campus-wide.
Sincerely, Andy Clark Molecular Biology & Genetics

Allele network homoplasy
Hello all, I have been looking at some population se-
quence data that appears to have characters with high
degrees of homoplasy in an allele network. These char-
acters, when mapped on the allele network, are in-
dividually responsible for the designation of unique
alleles in 4-5 regions of the allele network. These
problematic characters also appear to create exten-
sive ’loops’. Clearly, these characters are confounding
the interpretation of this allele network, and I would
like to deal with them systematically. Does anyone
know of a systematic method that allows one to deal
with/delete/reweight homoplasious characters in pop-
ulation data? If so would you please direct me to the
appropriate papers. Thanks, Wayne.

Base Composition Statistics
Dear All,
I am trying to statistically analyse the relationship be-
tween base composition across a set of sequences. The
aim is to show that the level of one of the bases is sig-
niﬁcantly correlated to the level of another base. I am
concerned though that a simple regression of the com-
positions for any two bases is not statistically valid, as
the summed percentage of the bases is constrained to
be a constant.
I would like to know if there is a standard way of sta-
tistically comparing values that are constrained and
bounded in this way. Any suggestions would be much
appreciated.

In the software FaMoz (available freely at http:/-

probability (for codominant or dominant loci), which
gives you, according to the number of loci considered,

answer directly to your question, but if you have
many clonally propagated individuals, the identity

Epistasis evolution38 EvolDir December 1, 2003
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
marcus feldman gave a talk today at the u of c (wed 12
nov) about the evolution of epistasis. strangely, he did
not mention the possibility that the structure of epis-
tasis patterns/gene interactions could be a simple side-
eﬀect of i) the genetic basis of essential biomechanic,
biostructural, and cell-dynamic features required for
function, performance, and ﬁtness; and ii) of the mech-
anisms that have been evolved to reduce the number
of deleterious mutations that engage in undesirable yet
avoidable epistatic interactions.
it is indeed very plausible that over evolutionary time
any unnecessary opportunities for mutations to show
epistatic interactions are eliminated to make sure that
new mutations (i.e. mostly deleterious mutations) af-
fect the smallest possible number of phenotypes thereby
avoiding additional deleterious eﬀects. and it is also
hard to think that this need will not constrain the spec-
trum of epistatic interactions much more strongly than
any other factors.
concededly, it is possible that modiﬁers of epistatic in-
teractions among mutations whose ﬁtness consequences
are negligible population-genetically, can arise result-
ing in a spectrum of epistasis patterns diﬀerent from
that typical for strongly deleterious mutations. but
such patterns should be much less interesting than the
patterns of epistasis of mutations aﬀecting traits more
important biomechanically and population-genetically,
patterns that, again, must have been tuned strongly by
natural selection.
ironically, however, the epistasis patterns/gene inter-
actions that are less constrained evolutionarily should
be those of greatest interest to genetic epidemiologists.
such patterns should indeed be typical for mutations
that cause “complex disease” and/or senescence, mu-
tations that have managed to evade the surveillance
of natural selection during the reproductive period by
means of intricate genotype-phenotype mappings and
complicated epistatic interactions, and/or are totally
free to engage in any kind of epistatic interaction be-
cause their phenotypic eﬀects are apparent only in older
individuals after selection has ceased to act, respec-
tively.
has anybody made these points before? and if yes
where?
best to you all
marcosFrench INAPG internships
November 2003
WOULD YOU RECEIVE A STUDENT IN YOUR
LAB?
CALL FOR INTERNSHIPS IN ECOLOGY
The Institut national agronomique Paris-Grignon (IN-
APG), located in Paris, France, is an institution for
advanced education whose 1st and 2nd years are com-
parable to the 3rd and 4th years in the University sys-
tem. Students are accepted into the Institute after a
two-year preparation and a relatively intense competi-
tion.
The teaching curriculum covers a wide spectrum of
ﬁelds: statistics, biology, agronomy, animal science,
biotechnology, food sciences, environmental sciences,
ecology, economics, etc.
INTERNSHIPS. At the end of the 2nd year, students
must spend at least two months in a research labo-
ratory, a company, a production plant, etc. Option-
ally, they can also perform a “long” internship of 6-
12 months inserted between the 2nd and 3rd years of
study.
BACKGROUND. Regarding population biology, all
students take courses in quantitative genetics (10
hours), population genetics (12 hours), population ecol-
ogy (10 hours) and ecosystem ecology (6 hours). In ad-
dition, those interested in ecology and evolution can
take more advanced courses in conservation ecology
(30 hours), evolutionary genetics (30 hours), theoret-
ical ecology (70 hours, incl. a personal project) or liv-
ing resource management (2 months, incl. a personal
project).
WORK TYPES. Many kinds of work are acceptable,
provided that the students get a minimal experience
of what research work is. Ideally, the student should
conduct a well-identiﬁed little project. The majority
of ecology students generally prefer ﬁeld projects but
there are always some who request theoretical projects
(data analysis, modelling).
DATES. Training must last a minimum of 8 weeks, to
be arranged after mid-May 2004 when courses are over
in Paris. This period may extend until early September.
For “long” internships, dates can be arranged between
mid-May 2004 and late August 2005.December 1, 2003 EvolDir 39
FUNDING. Most students receive some ﬁnancial help
from the INAPG. If you can oﬀer some stipend, this
will be welcome but is certainly not required.
If you can receive one or more of our students, either
this year or in future years, will you please answer the

Be very carefull especially about the camera. I’ve just
bought a system from Biorad. It has rather expensive
digital camera - Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC40 - that is
totally inappropriate for that kind of photography. You
need to try if the autofocus works in this special condi-
tions. In Lumix it doesn’t. I have also tried Casio QV-
R40 (twice cheaper) with the hood supplied by Biorad.
Autofocus works much better, besides it has manual
focus (very useful in case of weak banding). However
the quality of pictures is quite weak. My advice is: 1.
Check autofocus on dark surfaces with weak pattern
(e.g. grey paper with only a few thin lines drawn on
it). 2. Check the picture quality. 3. Buy camera with
manual focus - just in case. 4. Maximum sensitivity
should be about 300-400 ISO. 5. Minimal optical pa-
rameters are: aperture - 2,8; shutter - 1/4 s. The longer
the time can be the better. Usual conditions for EtBr
stained gel are 400ISO, shutter=4 sec, aperture=5,6. It
is better because of bigger focal depth than with shorter
times. 6. The optical resolution should be at least 4
Mln px. 7. You should have choice of level of compres-
sion - cameras with TIFF format are best however good
quality JPEG are also suﬃcient. Look carefully at the
pictures before you buy any camera :)
When I was in lab tech school, we used a UV transillu-
minator deck with a black cone-type thing with a hole
in the top that you would set over the gel and put the
digital camera up to. It seems that’s about the cheapest
one could set it up.
we are using a system you may be interested in. It
consists of Canon PowerShotG1 digital camera, hood
and two Kodak ﬁlters (as we’re using EtBr and SYBR
Green staining). In fact we purchased this system
from Elchrom Scientiﬁc ( www.elchrom.com ) and it was
about 5,000-5,500 EURO. However, I think that it was
due to a gel analysis software included (TotalLab).
We’re using this system over 2 years and haven’t had
any problems with it yet, quality of pictures is very
high. I think that you may assemble a system con-
sisting of some good digital Camera (eg Canon Power-40 EvolDir December 1, 2003
ShotG5), any hood and the appropriate commercially
available ﬁlters for about 1000 EURO. Hope this helps.
At Victoria University of Wellington a MSc and a Post-
doc documented their gels in this way. We simply
mounted a digital KODAK camera ( ~US$ 1000) on a
tripod and placed it over a transilluminator box. To
avoid diﬀuse UV radiation a plastic shade was cut out
of an old conference satchel, placed on top of the tran-
silluminator, leaving a rectangular window to place the
gels in. To visualise ethidium bromide stained gels we
bought a plastic orange ﬁlter at a photo shop in town.
We put a steel clamp next to the camera, clamped the
orange ﬁlter carefully with a bit of tissue and moved
it underneath the camera lens. Once the settings were
satisfactory, we left the whole set-up like this in our
dark room. The MSc student liked to score his gels
in negative, another useful option when using a digital
camera.
Yes there is such a system: put a cardboard box upside
down over a transluminator (UV), make a hole on what
is meant to be the bottom of the box, use a simple red
ﬁlter as those traditinnaly used with polaroid camera to
take EtBr stained DNA, put your cheap digital camera
over it, ideally on a stand. And Click! I don’t know if
this will work with EtBr but it does with Vista Green
(Amersham rpn5786, 10 ul per 1ml of loading blue; it
ties to the DNA and does not need to be added to the
gel itself).
A few years ago I was looking for the same thing you
are, a good and inexpensive gel documentation system
(price range $1000 - 2000). The cheapest that I know
about is a system from Kodak. One of the good things
about it is that the photos can be printed easily on
a laser printer. My understanding is that the paper
is more archival in quality than that found in fancier
systems.
I have used the Dark Reader system with a digital cam-
era. The box emits blue light and it has an orange cover
that goes over it. Cybr gold(Molecular Probes) stains
the DNA and shines through. It is as sensitive as ethid-
ium and less toxic. The box costs around $800(still
a little pricey, but maybe less than what you’ve been
looking at) and if you want to know where to get one,

Journal cost
For those of us at smaller institutions, the cost of scien-
tiﬁc journals has recently become relatively excessive.
While completing my doctorate at a large university, I
was not conscious of the true luxury aﬀorded to me by a
library system with a Big Ten budget. Taking a faculty
position at a smaller school was a rude awakening to
the reality of journal costs nowadays. I am writing to
make a quick plea of consideration to the members of
Evoldir - consider carefully the journals in which you
publish and be especially mindful of the pricing poli-
cies of those journals. The reasons I encourage this are
really twofold:
First, there are more and more journals that are priced
in such a way that really only the larger research insti-
tutions can aﬀord them, and not even then in all cases
(see below). This means your articles will be more lim-
ited in their impact than you might like - and despite
the impression you might have, research activity is quite
vibrant on many smaller campuses. Your work will have
limited impact in those arenas.
Second, I encourage you to consider publishing in jour-
nals that are marketed in such a way that they *are*aﬀordable. This means that those journals will have in-
creased demand and increased readership, diminishing
the current power the publishers of the most expensive
journals have over the market. There are a number of
ways to try to stem the tide of increased journal costs,
but the most grassroots solution seems to be that sci-
entists should stop publishing in those journals. As
consumers of journal material, we have no choice, we
must read those articles no matter where they are pub-
lished. Publishers know that, and they use that to their
proﬁt. But as the producers of journal material, we do

Paula J. Hane of Information Today Inc. reports:
“November 17, 2003 ” Cornell University Library has
posted a list of about 200 Elsevier journal titles it is can-
celing for 2004. Harvard University says it is preparing
for similar cuts in its Elsevier holdings. The University
of California continues its negotiations with the Dutch
publisher of scholarly scientiﬁc journals on behalf of all
the UC campuses, while faculty on some campuses have
resolved to boycott Elsevier if reasonable rates cannot
be negotiated. Other universities and library consortia
around the country are also in the throes of assessing
what they can aﬀord and what they will have to cancel
due to price increases and budget constraints. It’s jour-
nal renewal time and the strain of the tough decision
making is taking its toll on academic librarians, who
know that the results will, of course, directly aﬀect the
faculty and students they serve. . . . . The Academic
Senate at UC Santa Cruz recently passed a resolution
demanding reasonable rates and urging faculty “to se-
riously consider cutting ties with Elsevier by refusing
to sit on its boards, referee its journals, and submit pa-
pers to the publisher.” UCSC currently spends half of
its budget for online journals to ScienceDirect Online
from Elsevier.“

For those of us at smaller institutions, the cost of scien-

While completing my doctorate at a large university, I
was not conscious of the true luxury aﬀorded to me by a
library system with a Big Ten budget. Taking a faculty
position at a smaller school was a rude awakening to
the reality of journal costs nowadays. I am writing to
make a quick plea of consideration to the members of
Evoldir - consider carefully the journals in which you
publish and be especially mindful of the pricing poli-
cies of those journals. The reasons I encourage this are
really twofold:
First, there are more and more journals that are priced
in such a way that really only the larger research insti-
tutions can aﬀord them, and not even then in all cases
(see below). This means your articles will be more lim-
ited in their impact than you might like - and despite
the impression you might have, research activity is quite
vibrant on many smaller campuses. Your work will have
limited impact in those arenas.
Second, I encourage you to consider publishing in jour-
nals that are marketed in such a way that they *are*
aﬀordable. This means that those journals will have in-
creased demand and increased readership, diminishing
the current power the publishers of the most expensive
journals have over the market. There are a number of
ways to try to stem the tide of increased journal costs,
but the most grassroots solution seems to be that sci-
entists should stop publishing in those journals. As
consumers of journal material, we have no choice, we
must read those articles no matter where they are pub-
lished. Publishers know that, and they use that to their
proﬁt. But as the producers of journal material, we dohave a choice. Publish in journals that have reasonable
pricing schemes and discourage some of the outrageous
pricing being set by publishers at this time.

Dear all
I just would like to add to Paulo Russo comments an
aditional point to consider: most of third world scien-
tifc institutions can not aﬀort to pay for those journals,
even the “low price journals”, therefore this is start-
ing to be a “new barrier” to scientiﬁc development in
our contries avoiding the access to scientiﬁc information

An additional means has been discussed at the Bonn
University. We know that discontinuing the receipt of
those high priced journals is not a way to force lower
fees, because you exclude yourself from the information.
Thus, another way discussed was not to act as referee
for such journals/publishers. Whether this is really a
feasible way, I don’t know. But nevertheless I wanted
to add this point for discussion.December 1, 2003 EvolDir 43

I would like to remind EVOLDIR members that the
publisher’s of Systematic Biology provide 50 free “mem-

For your information: Systematic Biology (SB) is the
journal of the Society of Systematic Biologists. SB is
published six times per year: February, April, June,
August, October, and December. The objective of
this society is the advancement of the science of sys-
tematic biology in all its aspects of theory, principles,
methodology, and practice, for both living and fossil
organisms, with emphasis on areas of common inter-
est to all systematic biologists regardless of individual
specialization. Articles published in SB are original
theoretical or empirical studies that explore principles
and/or methods of systematics. Systematics is con-
sidered broadly to include phylogenetic studies of bio-
geography, paleontology, development, genes, and/or
anatomical/cellular/molecular traits of taxa. Empiri-
cal papers chosen for publication are judged to be of
interest to a broad systematics audience because they
represent exemplary case studies involving some impor-
tant contemporary issue or issues. These may be un-
usually thorough explorations of data, applications of
new methodology, illustrations of fundamental princi-
ples, and/or investigations of interesting evolutionary

Longnose dace samples
Hi.
Our lab is working on a wide scale phylogeographic
study of the longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae),
a common cyprinid of North American rivers. We
are doing DNA-analyses of this species and do already
have samples from several St.Laurence rivers (Quebec,
Canada).
In order to trace the origin of the North American pop-
ulations we hope to get samples from distant localities.
Is there someone who have well conserved specimen of
this species (or closely related species) and is ready to
send specimens or tissue samples to us to complement
our analysis? 95% ethanol is excellent for storing and
shipping the material. However, we will also accepte
samples that have been ﬁxed in formalin.

Outcrossing from AFLPs answers
The standard program for estimating outrcrossing rates
is Kermit Ritland’s MLTR (which I have used quite ex-
tensively), however this only accomodates codominant
data. Kermit has another program, MLDT, which is
intended for dominant data (which I have not used).
Both programs are apparently pretty identical, except
for the data type. They can be downloaded from:
http://genetics.forestry.ubc.ca/ritland/programs.html
In terms of number of maternal plants, and number
of seeds per plant: I have generally found that 20-30
maternal families, with 5-10 seeds per family will give
resonable estimates. Usually, increasing the number of
maternal families improves the outrcrossing rate esti-
mate more than adding more seeds per maternal fam-
ily. However, these numbers are for codominant (al-
lozyme) data. dominant data may give less information
per locus, so you may need to use more maternal plants
and/or seeds.
Feel free to write back if you have any questions about
using MLTR/MLDT

We have used microsatellites, which are generally con-
sidered codominant, for estimating outcrossing rates
and found that null alleles (just like a recessive al-
lele in the analysis) really mess up the estimates of
outcrossing rates (manuscript attached to this mes-
sage). The Holsinger program does estimate outcross-
ing rates with dominant data, but the error margins
are HUGE with dominant data! I strongly discourage
you from dominant markers for estimating outcrossing
rates. Isozymes give you much better estimates (as long
as you can take enough tissue from your plants without
causing damage).

I’m not sure whether Kermit Ritland’s programs allow
for dominant markers, but for an unsuccessful grant
proposal a few years ago, I did a few simulations sug-
gesting that with a relatively small number of polymor-
phic loci (say 30) you can distinguish selfed progeny
from outcross progeny by scoring as outcrossed any oﬀ-
spring that do *not* match the maternal genotype at
recessive loci.
I’m attaching the Word document that describes thesimulations. You can ignore the likelihood/Bayesian
stuﬀ that follows, unless you’re interested.

Summary: replies regarding the choice of a fourth year
Population Genetics Textbook
(Nov. 2003-EvolDir)
The two most recommended texts are: ’Genetics of
Populations’- P. Hedrick -the second edition-and: Hartl
and Clark. Hedrick’s text is viewed as being up-to-date
and was repeatedly credited as providing very good
coverage of ecologically relevant models (which quite a
number of respondents felt was important). In general,
each text appears to have its strengths and limitations,
so many respondents recommended a combination oftexts for achieving a better coverage of mathematical,
ecological, and molecular topics. A number of replies
indicated that they do not hold to a single text, but use
a variety of source materials. I have included extracts
from the email replies I received (below):
(I) Comments on top two texts:
(i) Genetics of Populations P. Hedrick
“Genetics of Populations, 2nd edition by Phillip W.
Hedrick is our preferred text. I ﬁnd it easier to fol-
low than Hartl and Clark and the book is fairly up
to date.” “I use and really like Hedrick.” “I really
like Hedrick’s ’Genetics of Populations’ for a somewhat
more advanced coverage.” “.... but it is not up to date
on molecular data.” “...together with standard text-
books like Hartl & Clark, I use Hedrick’s ”Genetics of
populations“ (2nd edition from 2000). I do not know
whether it is new enough for your purpose.” “I use
Hedrick’s text, but have also taught courses that are
more focused on evolutionary/ecological genetics using
the various Falconer editions. They lucidly cover stan-
dard population genetics but of course do not address
molecular evolution. Depending on the interest of the
class, forays into quantitative genetics are best done
with either Falconer (and now MacKay),or Lynch and
Walsh. ..Hedrick is also a great text, and covers eco-
logically relevant models.” “I have been teaching a 4th
year (really a mixed 4th year/graduate population ge-
netics class at Cleveland State, Ohio). I found Hedrick’s
”Population Genetics“ workable to this audience, but
the 2nd printing ...contained a number of ...errors in
formulas.”
(ii) Principles of Population Genetics Hartl & Clark
I received a number of replies that simply indicated that
Hartl & Clark is the text used.
“My guess is that you will ﬁnd the response is that Hartl
and Clark is the most used. It is thorough and well-
written, though the diﬀerent editions vary in their logic
of presentation. My understanding is that the most re-
cent version (ed. 4) is an improvement over the 3rd
edition. (I liked the second ed. better than the third.)
The primers also are reasonable, and may be better
for a short course.” “For texts that are more introduc-
tory, I like the relatively new ’Introduction to Conserva-
tion Genetics’ (Frankham, Ballou, and Briscoe) and the
good old Hartl ’Primer of Population Genetics’.” “...
there are also various versions.. which are not that well
received by students.” “..not really satisﬁed... Not up
to date on molecular data.” “.. together with standard
textbooks like Hartl & Clark, I use Hedrick’s ”Genetics
of populations“ (2nd edition from 2000).”
(iii) Also worth noting, is Richard Haliburton’s newDecember 1, 2003 EvolDir 47
book:
“I will try the new text from Prentice Hall ”Introduc-
tion to Population Genetics“ (ISBN 0-13-016380-5) by
Richard Halliburton when I do the course next (replac-
ing Hartl & Clark). I think ..(it) puts a more ecological
accent to the text...” “I am trying a new book for a
new class here that is an undergraduate-level popula-
tion genetics course. I haven’t used the book yet but I
like what I have seen so far. It is by Richard Hallibur-
ton, 2003. Introduction to Population Genetics. Pear-
son, Prentice Hall. www.prenhall.com.” (II) Other

ing revised). Durrett, Rick- Probabilistic Models for

Can people recommend population genetics software
to use in teaching population genetics? In particular,
knowing about programs that include options for single

be useful. If you have used it in class and found it suc-

Restriction problems answers
Dear all,
We posted an inquiry concerning AFLP restriction
and/or ligation problems with ECO R I and PST I (see
end of message).
In the meantime, we managed to get the Eco restriction
working for at least 1 species. Pre ampliﬁcation yielded48 EvolDir December 1, 2003
the expected smear, be it vaguer than for Mse, but this
is expected (Eco 6bp-cutter, Mse 4bp). A combination
of Eco and Mse worked as shown by pre-ampliﬁcation:
the combination yielded a fragment’s smear of diﬀerent
length as compared to Eco alone or Mse alone.
Pst I is still not working at all.
Below a compilation of the replies we got, which we
thought may be of use to all of you.
Thanks to all who took the time to reply, Peter Kupe-
rus and Marc Stift. stift@science.uva.nl
In response to your problem with EcoRI digestion and
ALFP ligations, I too had the same problem. I never
tried using PSTI, though. Initially, I would recommend
that you perform a single enzyme digest with EcoRI
to assess whether the enzyme is cutting your genomic
DNA at all. I found that diﬀerent methods for extract-
ing genomic DNA had an eﬀect on digestion, just as
I found that diﬀerent species of plant worked better
as well. In fact, I couldn’t get DNA using the Qiagen
Plant DNA extraction kit to digest with EcoRI.
The solution that I came up with was to add sperma-
dine to the digestion mix to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5
mM. This solved all of my problems, and allowed for
complete digestion with both enzymes, and clean liga-
tion of the adaptors, and all other downstream steps in
the protocol.
This procedure worked for me, but a friend of mine in
another lab who worked with birds was unable to ﬁx
the same problem by simply adding spermadine. So I
can’t say for sure that it will work for you.
But I think that you need to know whether or not EcoRI
is cutting at all, and if it isn’t then you should try the
spermadine.
Good luck, and feel free to contact me directly with any
additional questions.
Matt Streisfeld
Regarding your AFLP problems with the EcoRI/PstI
enzyme combination: I note that you are using two
enzymes with 6-bp recognition sequences. Such sites
only occur an average of every ~4.1 kb, and it seems
likely that very few PCR products would be within the
size range that would amplify consistently and/or be
resolved on typical denaturing gels. I guess the other
obvious question is whether you’re using the usual MseI
(or 4-cutter) adapter, with restriction site changed, for
one of the two sites. If you use the 6-cutter adapter
sequence for both sites, the templates will likely tendto form hairpins and amplify ineﬃciently. Of course,
if the same thing worked for you before when done in
exactly the same way, none of the above would explain
it.
Good luck getting this ﬁgured out.
Dave Remington
We are experiencing the same thing. Well, somewhat.
I have yet to fully grok the mysteries of AFLP’s yet...
The ﬁrst issue we had was that we were using an ex-
traction kit that had EDTA in the storage buﬀer. This
bound with the 4-hitter (if I remember correctly) and
we consistently got funky results. Have you tried a sin-
gle digestion for both enzymes to see if they are both
cutting? This way you can be sure both are cutting.
You can also throw in a standard lambda DNA and
get a control on the problem. We got around this by
storing the DNA is another buﬀer.
Currently, we are not experiencing the issue that all we
get are bands in the 0-150bp range and nothing above
that until 1-2kb. I have yet to ﬁgure out why. These
results are consistent across many taxa and I have yet
to ﬁgure out why.
If you could, please post any other responses back onto
the web or pass them my way. I would also appreciate
any information you get from this inquiry.
Rodney J. Dyer, PhD
I have been doing AFLPs with Eco and Mse enzymes.
It took me a while to get it going as I hadn’t noticed
one of the primers was cited as 5’-3’ and the other from
3’-5’. Consequently I had ordered one primer as the
reverse of what it should have been, and it obviously
did not work. It is certainly worth checking this, as it is
an easy mistake to make, and you will still get smears
on agarose gels due to fragments digested twice with a
single enzyme.

Dr Martin Taylor
Brief translation of Dutch reply: [Eco often does not re-
strict properly in plants. Cause is unclear. Two option
are methylation or inhibiting factors. Inhibition can be
revealed by adding small amount of extracted DNA to
lambda DNA and performing the restriction (may not
exclude methylation entirely).
Adapted DNA extraction may solve an inhibition prob-
lem. Apart from ordering an expensive isoschizomere,
there is no solution to methylation.December 1, 2003 EvolDir 49

Salamandra samples
Dear Members,
A question to be hold, We are investigating the popula-
tion genetics of salamandra salamdra. We collect sam-
ples for microsattelite analysis from the tails tip. As far
as we found, samples are kept in 95%EtoH. Does any-
one have a recommendation on what temperature and
weather diﬀerent conditions are needed for long term
preservation (0.5 years and on)? Much Obliged,

Software PopG 3
PopG version 3.0 has been released. PopG (formerly
called Simul8) simulates evolution of a single locus in
the presence of natural selection, mutation, migration,
and genetic drift. The program is free (in the sense of
“free beer”) with executables and its source code and
compilation support ﬁles available. No special permis-
sions or licenses are needed to run multiple copies of
the program in a class.
Executables are available for Windows, MACOS 9, MA-
COS X, and Intel-compatible Linux. Although most
users will not want or need to recompile it, compilation
support machinery is available with the source code for
Microsoft Visual C++ versions 6 and .NET, Metrow-
erks Codewarrior version 8, and Gnu C++.
The new version (3.0) diﬀers from the previous one (2.0,
released in 2001) largely in support for diﬀerent com-
pilers and availability of a native-mode graphics version
for MacOS X.For details see this web page:

Sonicator experience
Dear evoldir members,
I’m working with a new protocol for developing anony-
mous nuclear loci for phylogeographic/phylogenetic
analyses. The protocol involves the shearing, through
sonication, of genomic DNA into fragments around 1-
2 kb in length. I’ve never used a sonicator, and have
several questions for the group.
I found a protocol for generating DNA fragments
by sonication; it involves sonicating a ~0.3 micro-
gram/microliter solution of buﬀered DNA in 35 mi-
croliter aliquots. In some of the literature I’ve found
regarding sonicator specs, however, it seems like this is
an unrealistically low volume. How do other people do
this? Can sonicators work in such low volumes?
I’ve received price quotes of around $2500-$7000 for
sonicators (depending on the model). Is this typical?
What models are people using, and what prices are you
paying for them?
Thanks! Amy

Statistical Power answers
Hello,
I have sent a question to evoldir and some researches
have answered me, thank you very much. Below are
the question and some answers:50 EvolDir December 1, 2003
Good afternoon,
My name is Claudia, I am phD student in Genetics from
Brazil. We are trying to submit a work using Exact test
diﬀeretiation. The referees are asking the power test to
it, but we do not ﬁnd anything about it.
Do you know a software or someone that can help us?
Thank you very much, Cl´ audia

Hi Claudia,
I don’t know of a software to do this. One way to
go would be to simulate data under your hypothesis
(i.e., population spacing, migration and mutation rate
etc...) using e.g. easypop ( http://www2.unil.ch/izea/-
softwares/easypop.html ) and to estimate the power
given your sample size by running many replicates.
As for a reference for which test of diﬀerentiation is
more powerful, see our paper in genetics (1996) that
you can download from
http://www.unil.ch/popgen/research/reprints
Best wishes. Jerome Bob O’Hara
For k=2 and r=2 we can use the odds ratio as a statis-
tic and give it conﬁdence limits. For either one higher
it’s more diﬃcult, but I think the way to get a statistic
is to look at it as a contingency table. If there is no
association, then a chi-squared test would not be sig-
niﬁcant (this is an approximation to the Raymond and
Rousset test), and you can use the chi-squared value as
a statistic.
I would suggest something slightly diﬀerent. The chi-
squared is an approximation to a log-linear model. So,
what you could do is ﬁt a log-linear model with Haplo-
types and Populations as factors, and then you will get
a residual term (actually the Haplotypes x Population
interaction), which under the null hypothesis will have
a chi-squared distribution. Even if the null hypothesis
is false, it will have an approximately non-central chi-
squared distribution, so you can get conﬁdence limits
for that.
In practice, what you do is ﬁt a log-linear model with
Haplotypes and Populations as factors, and get the
residual deviance (call it D), and it’s degrees of free-
dom (which should be (k-1)(r-1), call it df). Then,
your point estimate is D, and the 95% conﬁdence lim-
its are C l*D/df and C u*D/df, where C l and C u are
the 2.5% and 97.5% points of a chi-squared distribution
with df degrees of freedom. You’ll have to ﬁnd both,because the distribution is not symmetrical.
To interpret these, note that under the null hypothe-
sis the expected value of D/df is 1, so the further you
are away from 1, the stronger the association. I don’t
have any great feel for how far away is from 1 you have
to be to have an important eﬀect, but you could do
simulations and look at this statistic.
Things are getting complicated, aren’t they? It’s what
happens when biologists try to do statistics. :-(

Claudia,I dont know the exact test to which you refer,
but a full proof, if time consuming way to generate the
power for any test is to generate random data with the
eﬀect size and variation that you wish to determine the
tests power to detect, and see if the test detects it. If
you repeat this say 1000 times, then the percentage of
times that you detect a diﬀerence is the power of the
test.as a simple example, imagine you wanted to deter-
mine the power of a t test to detect a diﬀerence of 5
mm, between two groups of 10 ﬁsh. Imagine also that
you have an estimate of the standard deviation of ﬁsh
size. You can then get a computer program to generate
two groups of random ﬁsh by drawing numbers at ran-
dom from normal distributions, with the appropriate
sd, but means that diﬀer by 5 mm. You then do a t
test to see if you can detect the diﬀerence. Repeat lots
of times for an estimate of power. Obviously it would
be better to get a computer program to automate the
whole process. Excel is pretty good for simpler kinds
of things. You will obviously need to come up with a
simulation that models the assumptions of the test that
y ou are interested in.However, depending on what the
editor has asked you to do, you might ﬁnd the attached
paper useful in avoiding it. It basically points out that
post hoc power analysis is a waste of time.Nick

hosts. We are initiating a project to examine the co-
evolution of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus and
its phage in both experimental microcosms and nat-
ural populations. We are looking for a postdoctoral
researcher to participate in all aspects of the project
such as overseeing the chemostat experiments and iso-
lating natural populations of Synechococcus and phage.
A qualiﬁed candidate will have a background in at
least two of the following areas: ecology, evolution-
ary biology, viral genetics, microbiology, and/or ex-
perimental microcosms. The person will be based at

PROJECT FOR POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AP-
PLICATION
Project tittle : Functional analysis of the /lessmuchP/greatermuchtran-
scription factors from the TCP domain family in Ara-
bidopsis.
Candidates are invited for a Postdoctoral Fellowship
Application in Toulouse at the LIPM, Laboratoire
des interactions plantes microorganismes, UMR 2594
CNRS/INRA Chemin de borde rouge 31326 castanet
tolosan Cedex
The aim of the project is to bring new insights into
how the TCP proteins aﬀect plant development. The
project will involve immunological approaches to study
the localisation of TCP proteins in planta and to char-
acterize protein/DNA complexes, using Arabidopsis as
a model system. The project is co-ordinate with a phD
research based around diﬀerent approaches involving
modiﬁcations of protein activity in planta and mRNA
expression studies. A key element of this work is the
utilisation of speciﬁc antibodies against designed pep-
tides, and the project would be particularly suitable for
an applicant with previous experiences of protein and
antibody manipulations. Further details of the group
project, and a summary of our research programme,
are available at: http://capoul.toulouse.inra.fr/-

University of Pretoria Postdoctoral Fellowship: Phylo-
geography of Reptiles and Frogs from the Cape Fold
Mountains Feb 2004-Dec 2005
A University of Pretoria postdoctoral fellowship is
available in the Molecular Ecology and Evolution Pro-
gramme of the Department of Genetics. The success-
ful applicant will work as part of a collaborative re-
search project on Comparative phylogeography of the
southern Afrotemperate Bioregion. The overall objec-
tives of the research project are: 1. To identify phylo-geographic patterns within taxa of the naturally frag-
mented Afrotemperate bioregion; 2. To infer histori-
cal processes and events which have shaped these pat-
terns of genetic diversity through phylogeographic com-
parisons across co-distributed species; 3. To develop
and extend methods for combining genetic information
across species and incorporating this into spatial man-
agement databases and 4. To incorporate our under-
standing of regional and local-scale processes into a
conservation framework that ensures the maintenance
of intraspeciﬁc genetic diversity and adaptive poten-
tial. The successful applicant will: 1. Conduct cooper-
ative ﬁeld sampling for endemic herpetofaunal species
in strategic areas of the Cape Fold Mountains with the
existing project team and associated postgraduate stu-
dents based at Pretoria University, Stellenbosch Uni-
versity and Western Cape Nature Conservation Board.
2. Analyse phylogeographic and population genetic di-
versity within target species groups (This postdoctoral
researcher, project coordinator, Dr. Cunningham, and
collaborators will each analyse diﬀerent target species
groups but will combine their resources for ﬁeld sam-
pling and collaborate on the development of new meth-
ods for combining data across species and for incorpo-
rating this information into spatial databases), 3. Use
spatial modeling techniques to predict the distribution
of species and genetic lineages within and among these
taxa.
PhD candidates with degrees in Zoology, Genetics
or Biology should contact Dr. Paulette Bloomer
for further details. Candidates with spatial mod-
eling experience are encouraged to apply. Please
send a full CV and the names of three referees to:
pbloomer@postino.up.ac.za. The fellowship includes a
bursary of R80 000 per year (with a second year of
support dependent on progress during the ﬁrst year),
a contribution towards relocation costs and a confer-
ence attendance award. Deadline for applications: 12
January 2004.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
