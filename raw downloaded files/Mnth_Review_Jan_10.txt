Dear colleagues and friends,
We are pleased to invite you to the “ESIL2010: A
decade of algal genomics” meeting (7-9 April, Ghent,
Belgium). The meeting marks the release of the assem-
bled Ectocarpus genome, the ﬁrst genome of a complex
multicellular alga and the publication of the accompa-
nying paper(s). Previous meetings have served as a fo-
rum for researchers working on Ectocarpus or by exten-
sion brown algae and diatoms to present their ongoing
research. For the upcoming meeting we are broadening
up the perspective by inviting leading scientists who
have gone through the process of assembling and anno-
tating genomes and are now in the phase of using these

that there are people experiencing problems with the
payment of the early registration fee due to the end of
the budgetary year in many institutions.
We have therefore decided to extend the deadline for
early registration with reduced fees until FEBRUARY
15, 2010, to allow time for the opening of the 2010 bud-
gets everywhere.
Remember that you don’t need to pay at the time of
Registration, but you have to do so BEFORE the dead-
line.
Best regards
Xavier Turon - on behalf of the Organizing Committee
PD. As our webmaster is on holydays, do not mind if
this new deadline does not appear in the webpage for
some days.

Dear colleagues and friends,
We are pleased to invite you to the DGC Meeting 2010.
The Daphnia Genomics Consortium (DGC) is an inter-
national network of scientists with a common goal to
foster the freshwater crustacean Daphnia as a premier
model system for genomics in ecology, evolution and
the environmental sciences.
This meeting aims to bring together the members of
the consortium at large, to facilitate the exchange of in-
formation on recent developments and results obtained
from the ongoing investigations into the genome biol-
ogy of Daphnia. Additionally, we welcome researchersworking with Daphnia who are not yet DGC partici-
pants and researchers working with other model or non-
model organisms in the ﬁeld of ecological genomics.
The DGC meeting will have a signiﬁcant impact on the
future development of the research groups involved in
the consortium. By this time, we will have ﬁnalized our
initial investigations of the draft D. pulex genome se-
quence, and we will begin the work of exploring data ob-
tained from the D. magna genome sequencing project.
This upcoming meeting continues the tradition of also
promoting collaborations between researchers working
within related disciplines, including limnology, ecotox-
icology, quantitative and population genetics, system-
atics, molecular biology and evolution, developmental
biology, genomics and bioinformatics.
The meeting will have plenary lectures from keynote
speakers in several research ﬁelds related to Daphnia
and other model organisms. The symposia of our meet-
ing will touch on several research topics:
* Ecology and Evolutionary Genomics * Toxicology and
Environmental Genomics of Natural and Human Stres-
sors * Genotype by Environment Interactions * Com-
parative Genomics and Development * Gene Expression
and Gene Function
Plan to also learn about the latest open source bioin-
formatic and high-throughput research tools, includ-
ing databases, expression and genotyping microarrays,
mapping panels for trait locus mapping, molecular ge-
netic protocols and services.
The venue is at the ﬁve century-old Katholieke Uni-
versiteit Leuven, in Belgium. Leuven is a beautiful me-
dieval town that combines a rich historical patrimonium
with a cheerful, ﬂourishing city culture and a creative
atmosphere for lively exchanges and debates.
We look forward to welcoming you in Leuven.

2nd Call <<New and Emerging Fungal Diseases of An-
imals and Plants : evolutionary aspects in the context
of global changes >>
The CNRS and Conferences Jaques Monod are hosting
a 4-day meeting at the French Marine Biology research
station in Roscoﬀ, Brittany on the evolution and dy-
namics of emerging fungal pathogens. This meeting will
focus on the widening impacts that fungi are having on
human, plant and animal health by considering the fac-
tors that drive their emergence within an evolutionary
context. Speciﬁcally, the meeting will consider whether
environmental change is facilitating fungal range ex-
pansions and genotypes, and to what extent this is
predictable. The meeting will bring together leading
evolutionary biologists, theoreticians and fungal biolo-
gists/ecologists in a beautiful setting to consider these
questions and to formulate new research strategies.

This is a one-day symposium.
Background: Divergence time estimation is an excit-
ing current area of interest, and we are seeing great
advances in both methodologies and taxonomic cover-
age. Research on arthropod divergences is vital due to
their extreme biodiversity and both ecological and eco-
nomic importance. Dating in arthropods can provide
insight into fascinating questions such as the timing of
the great angiosperm divergence, co-evolution of para-
sites and hosts, and a variety of other aspects of life on
earth, encompassing subject areas across anthropology,
vector biology, paleontology, geology and geography.
This workshop on molecular dating in arthropods in-
tends to provide an opportunity to share new method-
ological advances, explore current results on taxa of
interest and provide interface time among fossil and
molecular researchers. The set up of this workshop is
speciﬁcally aimed to promote networking and collabo-
ration, with extended lunch and coﬀee times provided
for discussion.
We have a broad program of speakers, ranging from
molecular researchers to paleontologists, with a diverse
range of talks from organismal work to methodology.
Speaker line-up: Sean Brady, Frank Burbrink, Seth By-
bee, CJ Geraci, David Grimaldi, Akito Kawahara, Karl
Kjer, Jessica Light, Corrie Moreau, Sergios-Orestis
Kolokotronis, Chris Owen, Alex Pyron, Sara Ruane,

CityUNewYork phylogeography
A PhD position in integrative and model-based phylo-
geography is available at the City University of New
York (CUNY).
The candidate will develop multi-taxa phylogeographic
models that can be speciﬁed by a wide range of
hypotheses relevant to community assembly, specia-
tion, natural selection, and biogeographic responses
to climate changes. By developing and using the
tools of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
to specify complex demographic/evolutionary mod-
els, the candidate will enable powerful new tech-
niques for community-level phylogeographic inference.12 EvolDir January 1, 2010
Although this approach will allow the candidate
to address questions in a wide variety of biogeo-
graphic contexts, the emphasis will be on develop-
ing multi-taxa ABC models that can be built from
ecological niche models and can incorporate the sub-
genomic data emerging from next-generation sequenc-
ing technology. The student will work with Mike
Hickerson (see http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/Biology/-
Hickerlab/index.html ) and will interact with a strong
phylogenetics/phylogeography group spread across sev-
eral CUNY campuses and the AMNH.

Two positions for PhD students.
We seek two graduate students: one with a background
in evolutionary biology and one with a background in
mathematical biology for an exciting opportunity to
work on a collaborative project at the interface of de-
mography and ecological genetics.
The project focuses on the contributions of demogra-
phy and genetics in the founding and spread of new
populations, combining a model biological system
(Tribolium ﬂour beetles) and quantitative models. The
evolutionary ecologist will conduct the experiments:
previous experience in lab experiments using insects or
other model organisms would be helpful, and a strong
background in evolutionary ecology is vital. This
student would join the lab of Ruth Hufbauer at Col-
orado State University ( http://lamar.colostate.edu/-
˜ hufbauer/, http://www.ecology.colostate.edu/ ,http://www.evolution.colostate.edu/ ), and will have
the opportunity to collaborate closely with the
mathematical biologist.
The student in mathematical biology will develop
models to quantify the contributions of genetics
and demography from experimental data. Previ-
ous experience with stochastic processes, and likeli-
hood or Bayesian methods of model estimation would
be a plus but all students with a genuine inter-
est in mathematical biology are encouraged to ap-
ply. The student would join the active and growing
lab of Dr Brett Melbourne at University of Colorado,
Boulder ( http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/facultysites/-
melbourne/ ) where related projects are developing the-
ory in population biology applied to extinction, inva-
sion, climate change, and biodiversity maintenance.
Applications should be submitted as soon as possible to
the relevant program given the late date. Please get in
touch with either Ruth or Brett for additional details
on how to apply. When you write, please send a CV
that includes information on coursework and grades.

ETH Zurich EvolutionaryGenetics
PhD position in Theoretical Evolutionary Genetics /
Computational Biology / Molecular Evolution at the
Theoretical Biology Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland
A PhD position is available at the Theoretical Biology
Group, ETH Zurich ( http:/www.tb.ethz.ch ) under the
supervision of Dr. Frederic Guillaume and Prof. Se-
bastian Bonhoeﬀer to study the genetics of adaptation
using both bioinformatics resources and computational
modeling approaches. The position is funded for three
years by ETH Zurich, starting from now.
The project asks questions related to the evolution
of pleiotropy and of the modular structure of the
genotype-phenotype map in the context of phenotypic
evolution in multivariate traits space. A ﬁrst step will
be to deﬁne meaningful ways of measuring pleiotropyJanuary 1, 2010 EvolDir 13
or modularity of genes aﬀecting phenotypic characters
in order to accurately describe the constraints acting
on their evolution and the variation of the modularity
of the genotype-phenotype map in model systems. The
second step will seek to integrate the type of patterns
observed into models of phenotypic evolution in order
to understand the evolutionary signiﬁcance of variation
of modularity of the genotype-phenotype map. Speciﬁc
questions related to the genetics of adaptation will then
be asked within this evolutionary model. The candidate
will be encouraged to develop her/his own questions
within this general framework.
The applicants should have a strong background and
interests in evolutionary genetics and molecular evolu-
tion. The skills needed are mainly knowledge of bioin-
formatics tools, computer programming, and an aﬃnity
with mathematics and statistics. Knowledge of a pro-
gramming language will be considered a plus (C/C++
would be ideal). A master degree in biology or related
ﬁelds is required.
Motivated applicants should send (as PDFs) a CV with
a brief summary of past research experiences, a one
page statement of research interests, and complete con-
tact information for at least two references to fred-
eric.guillaume@env.ethz.ch. Informal inquiries before
application are encouraged.

nity Ecology and Landscape Genetics: Dr. Gina Wimp
is seeking students interested in understanding the
mechanisms that lead to the loss of biodiversity and
increased risk of extinction in fragmented habitats. Dr.
Wimp’s work takes place in the intertidal salt marsh
where a rise in mean tidal height over the past 60 years
has led to a change in the demography of the two domi-
nant grass species, with the more ﬂood-intolerant grass
(Spartina patens) contracting in size. She uses manip-
ulative experiments to examine the eﬀects of habitat
loss and fragmentation in S. patens on the abundance,
diversity and composition of the dependent arthropod
community. The Wimp and Hamilton labs have devel-
oped microsatellite genetic marker loci to examine the
eﬀects of habitat fragmentation on gene ﬂow in two of
the dominant herbivore species found in S. patens, both
of which are ﬂightless, specialist planthoppers. Inter-
ested students should contact Dr. Gina Wimp via email
(gmw22@georgetown.edu).
Applicants interested in pursuing graduate research in
community ecology will work with Gina Wimp ( http:/-
/biology.georgetown.edu/ faculty/wimp/research/)
and students interested in pursuing research in land-
scape genetics will work with both Gina Wimp and
Matthew Hamilton ( http://www9.georgetown.edu/-

Mechanisms of phenotypic evolution: Dr. Peter Arm-
bruster seeks a highly motivated PhD student to join
his laboratory’s research on mechanisms of phenotypic
evolution in natural populations. The Armbruster lab
is currently focusing on the invasive and medically im-
portant mosquito Aedes albopictus. This mosquito in-
vaded the US in 1985 and spread rapidly over approxi-
mately 15 degrees of latitude. This natural experiment
in evolution provides an exciting opportunity to iden-
tify the molecular and physiological mechanisms under-
pinning climatic adaptation during invasion and range
expansion. Dr. Armbruster’s research is currently sup-
ported by grants from both NIH and NSF, and inte-
grates a broad range of approaches, including molecu-
lar biology, bioinformatics, physiology, and quantitative
genetics. Interested students should contact Dr. Peter

Fully funded PhD studentship starting October 2010
FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR ALL EU STUDENTS
The eﬀects of genetic variation in the social environ-
ment on behavioural and life history traits
Supervisors: Dr Reinmar Hager and Dr Richard
Preziosi
The social environment provided by family or group
members has been shown to be highly inﬂuential for
adult phenotypes and variation in individual ﬁtness,
particularly in early development. Recent research has
highlighted that the social environment is determined
by the genotypes of interacting individuals and can thus
respond to selection and evolve, yet, the signiﬁcance of
this is poorly understood. The aim of the project is
to investigate how important genetic variation in thesocial environment is in determining phenotypic varia-
tion in both behavioural and life history traits. What is
the nature and the genetic basis of social interactions,
how do these interactions aﬀect complex traits such as
parental behaviour or sexually selected traits and how
do they diﬀer across taxa and why? The project will ad-
dress these unresolved issues using experimental work
in model (mice) and non-model organisms (insects e.g.
cockroaches and earwigs) combining behavioural, ge-
netical and statistical analyses. There is the opportu-
nity to develop own research projects in conjunction
with ongoing research in the tropics and to contribute
to teaching on ﬁeld courses.
Further Information This studentship is open to all na-
tionalities although no funding is available to cover the
higher tuition fees for non-EU applicants.

NewZealand HybridEvolution
PhD position: Untangling complex evolutionHybridisation is an important evolutionary process that
can play a role in adaptive radiations where species
rapidly colonise new niches and respond to new environ-
ments. Hybrids inherit genetic material from two par-
ent species, making them hard to detect when studying
single genes. Fortunately, innovations in DNA sequenc-
ing now make it aﬀordable to study many genes simul-
taneously. However, hybridisation is not easy to distin-
guish from other biological processes; current methods
assume that evolutionary relationships inferred for dif-
ferent genes are error-free; all conﬂict is attributed to
hybridisation. In reality conﬂict is often caused by esti-
mation errors, the random nature of inheritance within
populations, and missing data. This Marsden funded
project will create the statistical methods and software
necessary for evolutionary biologists to understand how
prevalent hybridisation has been in shaping the New
Zealand biota.
We are seeking to appoint two PhD students. The
sorts of skills we need are very broad - knowledge of
mathematics and/or statistics, algorithm development
and computer programming, and genetics and evolu-
tion. We realise that it may be unrealistic to expect all
these skills in any one candidate so we are seeking two

phylogeny genomics
Mark Fishbein (Oklahoma State University, Depart-
ment of Botany) seeks a graduate student (PhD or MS)
to apply genomic approaches to the phylogeny of Amer-
ican milkweeds (Asclepias, Apocynaceae). The student
will participate in an NSF-funded collaborative project
with Dr. Aaron Liston and Dr. Richard Cronn at Ore-
gon State University.
Milkweeds have served as a important model system
for studies of the evolution of pollination systems and
plant defenses against herbivory. Continued phyloge-
netic study is required to fully resolve species level re-
lationships, to further test and expand upon theories of
coevolution of plants, pollinators, and herbivores, and
to develop milkweeds as a model system for the com-
parative study of genomes.
Graduate research in the Fishbein lab may include
working with the complete genome of Asclepias syri-
aca (common milkweed) and chloroplast genomes from
ca. 150 species of Asclepias and relatives. Research ac-
tivities can involve ﬁeld work in the US, Mexico, and/or
South America, next-generation DNA sequencing, and
phylogenetic and phylogenomic anlalysis. Opportu-
nities exist for PhD students to develop independent
projects making use of the considerable data generated
for this research.
Students will be supported by a combination of

****Developing a novel approach to antimicrobial
treatments: social dynamics in bacteria and the Trojan
Horse*** * We aim to exploit our understanding of bac-
terial social dynamics, for clinical applications. Specif-
ically, we propose to genetically engineer competitively
dominant strains of bacteria to drive medically beneﬁ-
cial alleles, such as antibiotic sensitivity, into wildtype
populations.
Background: This interdisciplinary project (theory, ex-
perimental evolution, molecular microbiology) builds
on a series of experiments showing that behaviours im-
portant for bacterial virulence (e.g, production of extra-
cellular products) are cooperative (Griﬃn et al. 2004,
Nature; Diggle et al. 2007, Nature). A cooperative be-
haviour is one where the cost of performance is borne
by a single individual, while the beneﬁt is shared. We
developed the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a
model system for testing predictions about when pop-
ulations of cooperative individuals can be invaded by
non-cooperative cheats. We found that the presence of
cheat strains has consequences for virulence in a mouse
model: in mixed cooperator-cheat infections, the mor-
tality rate was reduced by 50%, relative to cooperator-
only infection (Rumbaugh et al. 2009, Current Biol-
ogy). This work has led to ﬁling of a patent.
Outline: The student will develop a method of exploit-
ing the invasive ability of cheat strains to drive med-
ically beneﬁcial alleles, such as antibiotic sensitivity,
into wildtype populations (the cheat is therefore the
Trojan Horse). We have produced theoretical models
to demonstrate that if the cost of expressing a Trojan
gene could be oﬀset by the reduction of costs conferred
by being a social cheat, then a Trojan cheat could out-
compete wildtype populations (Brown et al. 2009 Phil
Trans R Soc). We have already shown in vivo that the
invasion of a cheat will lead to immediate reductions in
virulence but using Trojan cheats we also generate the
opportunity for subsequent control using antibiotics, for
example. By reshaping the antibiotic resistance proﬁle
of the infective population, this strategy oﬀers a novel
response to multiply resistant infections.Collaborators: Ashleigh Griﬃn, Sam Brown (Dept Zo-
ology, Oxford) and Steve Diggle (Molecular Medical

AncientGenomes
A two year MSc position (with possible extension for
two years) is vacant at the Royal Belgian Institute of
Natural Sciences ( http://www.naturalsciences.be/ ).
The successful candidate will be encouraged to initi-
ate a PhD. The major challenge in the project “Ge-
nomic Studies on Natural History Collections: A feasi-
bility study” will be the application and development
of next generation sequencing approaches for phyloge-
nomic and genomic research on Natural History Collec-
tions. This project will be carried out in close collabo-
ration with the Genomic Core Facility of the Katholieke
Universiteit Leuven ( http://www.kuleuven.be/ ).
Project summary:
Recently developed high-throughput gene sequencing
methods oﬀer exciting opportunities for genomic re-
search on zoological museum specimens, as this tech-
nology is not hampered by the degraded state of the ob-
tained DNA. This project adopts next generation DNA
sequencing methods and adapts them to be used on
a selected specimen/tissue RBINS/RMCA collection.
This pilot study uses the Muridae as a test case to il-
lustrate the potential use/limitations of zoological mu-
seum specimens for future comparative genomic stud-
ies. The implementation of these novel genomic tech-
nologies will add a new dimension to the future scien-
tiﬁc valorization of NHCs way beyond the scope of this
project.
We oﬀer a two year MSc position (2 years, with a pos-
sible extension of 2 years):
Successful candidates will have the opportunity to start
a PhD and will manage/conduct laboratory assays de-
signed to develop the protocol that allows the ampliﬁ-
cation and sequencing of multiple genetic markers from
museum specimens by NGS technology. Candidates
must have an MSc and experience in genomics and/or
phylogenetics, proﬁciency in both written and spoken
English, excellent social skills, ability to work indepen-
dently and high motivation will be assets.January 1, 2010 EvolDir 23
The position will start in February/March 2010 and the
project will run for 2 years, with a possible extension
of 2 years.
Applications should include a covering letter motivat-
ing your interest, full C.V. and names of three referees.

Graduate Student Positions In Evolutionary Genetics
I. Speciation Genomics in the European Corn Borer
II. Genetics and Evolution of Copy-Number Polymor-
phism
PhD positions in evolutionary genetics are available in
the laboratory of Erik Dopman in the Department of
Biology at Tufts University. Eﬀorts in the lab are di-
rected towards understanding speciation and mutation.
Our work on speciation addresses the evolution of phe-
notypic diﬀerences between diverging populations, with
an emphasis on so- called “speciation genes” that con-
tribute to reproductive barriers. Our work on muta-
tion investigates large-scale changes in the number of
chromosome segments or gene copies, which are com-
monly known as copy- number polymorphisms (CNPs).
Please see http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/dopman/-
default.asp for a detailed description of the lab and its
activities.
We seek creative and motivated graduate students to
work on either of the labs two main research projects,
but the potential for developing new research directions
is high. A trusted colleague once said that successful
PhD students have ability to work with others, and
a sense of humor, both of which are needed to make
science fun and worthwhile. In addition to these at-24 EvolDir January 1, 2010
tributes, a strong undergraduate background in evolu-
tionary biology is required, as is some prior research ex-
perience. Relevant and highly desirable experience in-
cludes application of molecular genetic techniques (e.g.,
PCR, cloning, sequencing, microarrays), or analysis of
gene or genome data (e.g., DNA sequence, transcript
abundance).
Contemporary biology is built on understanding life
at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population and
community levels. The Department of Biology at Tufts
is dedicated to providing a uniﬁed and comprehensive
view of biological processes. Evidence for excellence
in research at Tufts can be found in Carnegie Founda-
tions ranking Tufts as a /Research Extensive institution
V its highest classiﬁcation for degree-granting colleges
and universities. The Department of Biology is located
on Tufts main campus in Medford, MA. With two ad-
ditional Tufts campuses (in Boston, MA, and Grafton,
MA), other research universities (e.g., Harvard, MIT),
and the vibrant city of Boston all within reach, Med-
ford and Tufts are ideal places to live and work. See
http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/ for more information on
the Biology Department.
Interested individuals should immediately contact Erik
Dopman (erik.dopman@tufts.edu ) and provide in PDF
format the following documents: (1) a 1-2 page cover
letter that includes a statement of research interests,
and summaries of educational background and prior
research experience, and (2) a CV that includes GRE
scores and the names and contact information of three

UFlorida SeasonalAdaptation
The Hahn lab at the University of Florida is look-
ing to recruit a new MS or PhD student to join our
group in the fall of 2010. We are a small but fun
group interested broadly in how genetic and physio-
logical variation underlie organismal performance, and
ultimately ﬁtness ( http://danhahn.ifas.uﬂ.edu ). Our
work is integrative and includes numerous tools and
perspectives from next-generation population genetics
and functional genomics to more traditional whole or-
ganism physiology and performance. Current projects
in the lab largely focus on one of three main areas:
1) Mechanisms of life history timing and adaptive di-
versiﬁcation. Over the last 200 years native ﬂies that
fed on hawthorn fruits shifted onto a newly intro-
duced host, domesticated apples, and divergence in
the fruiting times of these two host races has driven
temporal isolation and genetic diﬀerentiation between
the two host races, making the Rhagoletis pomonella
system a test-book case of sympatric speciation and
adaptive ecological divergence in action. In collabora-
tion with Jeﬀ Feder’s group at the University of Notre
Dame ( http://biology.nd.edu/JeﬀreyFeder.shtml ) we
are studying the genetic architecture and physiologi-
cal mechanisms of diapause (hibernation) timing and
overwintering energetics in the host races of the apple
maggot.
2) Mechanisms of seasonal and reproductive phenotypic
plasticity. The world is always changing and many or-
ganisms deal with these changes with plastic pheno-
types. We study the underlying mechanisms and con-
sequences of seasonal phenotypic plasticity in insect di-
apause (overwinter hibernation) and reproductive tim-
ing. Diapause is a great escape mechanism that in-
sect use to mitigate the stresses of winter and to timetheir life histories to exploit favorable periods, but dia-
pause also has costs. Post-diapause insects often suﬀer
lower survival and fecundity than non-diapause individ-
uals of the same species. How do they deal with these
costs? For example, many diapause-destined insects in-
crease their fat reserves prior to overwintering, but how
do they do it (e.g., what physiological and nutritional
mechanisms are involved in increased fattening?) and
what are the consequences of increased fat stores (e.g.,
do big fat animals survive better or reproduce more af-
ter winter than skinny ones?). Moths, butterﬂies, and
ﬂies are our current favorite model organisms for this
work and John Hatle at the University of North Florida
is a key collaborator ( http://www.unf.edu/˜jhatle/ ).
3) Stress and sex. Too hot, too cold, too dry...life is
stressful, particularly for small ectotherms like insects.
We are currently investigating the role of both natu-
ral and extreme environmental stress on the physiol-
ogy and sexual performance of males in the Caribbean
fruit ﬂy, a lekking species with substantial male-male
competition. The Caribbean fruit ﬂy is a good model
for exploring the role of male condition on sexual se-
lection and it is a model for invasive fruit ﬂy species,
like the devastating Mediterranean fruit ﬂy, making this
project an excellent opportunity for both basic evolu-
tionary ecology and potential applications to the Ster-
ile Insect Technique as an ecologically-friendly control
method in an economically important insect pest.
Our lab is located in the Department of Entomology
and Nematology at the University of Florida. We are
the largest department of our kind in the United States
with approximately 60 faculty and well over 100 grad-
uate students. The size of our department combined
with the dozens of insect biologists housed next door
at the USDA Center for Medical and Veterinary Ento-
mology and colleagues in departments across campus
(e.g., Biology, Genetics, and the UF Med School) pro-
vide the enormous intellectual and physical resources
that make UF an excellent place to study evolutionary
ecology and integrative physiology. In addition to the
work mentioned above, students may develop their own
projects if it ﬁts into our larger conceptual framework.
Interested students should contact Dan Hahn
(dahahn@uﬂ.edu <mailto:dahahn@uﬂ.edu >) as soon
as possible because while applications are due later in
the spring, departmental assistantships are typically
allocated to the top students in January. Please include

UGuelph 2 AntPhylogenetics
MSc positions in ant phylogenetic diversity and biogeo-
graphic linkages across the Mozambique Channel M.
Alex Smith, Department of Integrative Biology, Biodi-
versity Institute, University of Guelph
Positions for MSc students are available in my lab to
work on assessing the phylogenetic diversity and biogeo-
graphic linkages for ant species across the Mozambique
Channel.
This research project will generate hypotheses of bi-
otic diversiﬁcation and biogeography using ants across
the southwest Indian Ocean islands (SWIO) islands,
and assess their relationships to the fauna of main-
land Africa using mitochondrial and nuclear gene se-
quence data. This project targets six genera from three
ant subfamilies, Cerapachyinae, Myrmicinae and Pseu-
domyrmecinae, for detailed species-level revisions and
phylogenetic analyses. These taxa are groups of con-
siderable ecological and phylogenetic interest.
Some question to be asked include: (1) How many col-
onization events occurred from Africa to the SWIO is-
lands for each genus? (2) What was the role, if any,28 EvolDir January 1, 2010
of the Comoros islands as stepping stones? (3) Was
there any backward movement from Madagascar to the
African mainland or to other SWIO islands? (4) What
was the timeframe for these dispersal events? (5) Are
patterns of ant community change with elevation com-
parable to an ongoing project in Costa Rica?
The specimens collected from the Seychelles, Tanzania
and Mozambique will be permanently archived in the
California Academy of Sciences where technicians will
ensure that the ant specimens are shipped to Guelph.
Here it will be the responsibility of the student ﬁlling
this position to extract DNA, sequence and manage and
analyse the data for these specimens in the BOLD data-
system ( www.barcodinglife.org ).
An undergraduate background with courses and/or re-
search experience in evolution, genetics, ecology, and
basic molecular techniques is preferred. Motivated stu-
dents with a keen interest in understanding the phylo-
genetics and biogeography of this interesting group of
organisms would be ideal.
This funded position will permit a student to take ad-
vantage of opportunities and research interests in the
lab, but it is expected that the successful applicant will
develop novel research hypotheses and approaches to
testing these hypotheses. For more information, con-
tact Dr. Alex Smith at salex@uoguelph.ca or visit the
website ( www.uoguelph.ca/˜salex ).
Interested students should submit a resume, unoﬃcial
transcript, a statement of research interests and arrange
for three letters of reference to be sent by e-mail to:
Dr. Alex Smith (salex@uoguelph.ca). Expected start
date(s) will be May, 2010 and September, 2010. While
all qualiﬁed candidates are encouraged to apply, Cana-
dian citizens and permanent residents of Canada will
be given priority.

UGuelph EvolutionaryTheory
Evolutionary Theory/Computational Biol-ogy/Theoretical Evolutionary Physiology
There is an MSc or PhD position available in the broad
area of evolutionary theory in my lab. Below I sum-
marize current projects that I am working on and a
student would be welcome to work on these or pursue
their own line of research.
Both projects that I am currently working on seek to
understand how multivariate traits evolve. In the ﬁrst
project, gene-genealogical approaches are used to model
multivariate trait evolution. In the second project, bio-
physical principles are used to model a multivariate
trait, and the evolution of the multivariate trait and its
underlying physiology is subsequently modeled. This
second project is currently focused on the multivariate
trait associated with calcium signaling in animals.
Most processes in biology are part of a multivariate con-
text. For instance, adaptation involves Hutchinson’s
idealized concept of the multivariate niche. Likewise,
in applied problems such as agriculture, a challenge is
to optimize multiple traits to maximize yield or sus-
tainability. In medicine, problems such as the adverse
eﬀects of medication are not related to the target of
the medication, but side-eﬀects with are of a multivari-
ate nature. The broad theme of research in my lab is
to understand how evolution works in a multivariate
context. Part of the research is of an abstract nature,
while other parts are applied. With respect to applied
components, calcium signaling is widely used in animals
and is associated with health problems such as cancer
and diseases of the heart.

Project description: The Brassicaceae are developing
into the most important model group in plant science
aside the grass family. This is not only because of the
model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica na-
pus, but also the enormously increasing knowledge on
all aspects of biology and evolution concerning this fam-
ily The family is characterized by frequently occurring
hybridization and poly-ploidization, which, as a conse-
quence, is greatly aﬀecting genome size and structure,
but also any mode of speciation. Nonetheless, it is still
unclear if the evolution of the Brassicaceae on the var-
ious taxonomic/temporal levels and of its evolutionary
lineages is mostly or even best explained by multiple ra-
diation events. A fact that can also account for the diﬃ-
culties to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships within
the family. In the overall project we are aiming to use
the actually available knowledge and phylogenetic data
and a phylogenetic backbone to address these principles
questions of crucifer evolution by adding genome size
and cytogenetic data across the whole family. In the
proposed PhD project the chalcone synthase has been
selected as candidate locus to reconstruct such a robust
framework phylogeny with a nearly constant molecular
clock. This will enable calibration of any evolution-
ary hypothesis. In order to obtain this evolutionary
framework, chs genes have to be characterized in detail
(copy number, ortholoques, paraloques, pseudogenes)
in a representative set of taxa across the whole Bras-
sicaceae family. Subsequent functional and theoretical
analysis will provide additional information on modes
of molecular evolution creating chs diversity in the en-
tire family.

Cannibalism and conﬂict in Formica ants Principal In-
vestigator: Heikki Helanter¨ a, PhD
The diﬀerentiation between queens and workers in so-
cial insect colonies, such as those of ants, bees and ter-
mites, is fundamental to their huge evolutionary and
ecological success and diversity. Despite the apparent
unity of their societies, which individuals develop into
which caste is a source of intense evolutionary and be-
havioural conﬂict between indivuals within the colonies.
This is because each individual would increase their ﬁt-
ness by developing into a reproductive queen that pro-
duces oﬀspring in the next generation, rather than any
of their nestmates. The competition for a breeding posi-
tion is why larvae behave cannibalistically and eat other
brood in the colony. This competition is predicted to
be the more intense, the less related the nestmates are
to each other, because harming closely related individ-
uals decreases the amount of shared genes transferredto future generations.
We will study determinants of the variation in canni-
balism in the ant genus Formica using experimental and
genetic data. The research will have two angles. First,
we will study what are the evolutionary and ecological
determinants of variation, concentrating especially on
the queen number of colonies, that determines the re-
latedness between individuals, but is also a key feature
of ant ecology. Second, we will investigate the ﬂexibil-
ity and information use that underlies the behavioural
decisions made by larvae. Combining these two angles
gives us a comprehensive picture of adaptive social be-
haviour in its ecological and evolutionary setting. Fur-
thermore, the research will increase our understanding
of a fundamental feature underlying the success and
diversity of social insects.

COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF NEXT GENER-
ATION SEQUENCE DATA Second generation se-
quencing technologies such as 454 GS-FLX have mas-
sively parallelized the determination of nucleotide order
within genetic material resulting in the ability to pro-
duce extremely large data sets at relatively low cost.
However, the sequence reads produced are signiﬁcantly
shorter than Sanger sequencing and error rates can be
high and non-uniform. As a consequence we are cur-
rently in a situation where experiments are generating
data sets of such magnitude and complexity that we do
not have appropriate methodologies for eﬃciently pro-
cessing them let alone for eﬀective analysis. In this
project we will focus on the analysis of variation in
next generation population data sets available in public
databases or from academic or industrial collaborators.
The study of high-depth (or ultra-deep) data sets is of
particular importance in the identiﬁcation of low fre-
quency mutations or variants in the context of viral
infections (Archer et al. 2009), bacterial populations
and metagenomic projects. The speciﬁc aims of the
project will be to investigate polymorphism frequencies
versus error rates, phylogenetic inference and visuali-
sation of evolutionary history (Archer and Robertson,
2007), co- evolution (Hakes et al., 2007), recombination
(Archer et al., 2008; Simon-Loriere et al., 2009) and
other appropriate properties of high- depth data sets.
This will complement existing projects in the Robert-
son group, for example, www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/-
segminator (Archer et al. 2009). Note, the exact
remit of the project can also be changed to ﬁt with
other on-going projects in the group, see <http:/-

Health at the University of Notre Dame, is seeking
graduate students motivated to use the tools of ge-
nomics and classical genetics to understand the evo-
lution of drug resistance and virulence in malaria par-
asites. Solving the challenges of malaria will require
knowledge of the multitude of complex molecular inter-
actions within the parasite cell. In the systems genetics
framework we can identify how allelic variation drives
a cascade of measurable traits, from transcript abun-
dance (eQTL, Gonzeles et al, PLoS Biology, 1 Septem-
ber 2008) to protein and metabolite levels to cellular
physiology, that lead to the critical phenotypes like
drug resistance and virulence that make malaria such
a devastating disease. Whole-genome network views
and computational methods promise new avenues for
attack against malaria. Our lab combines wet-lab and
computational approaches with a strong evolutionary
perspective. The Eck Institute ( http://www.nd.edu/-
˜eigh/ ) is a multidisciplinary group of principal investi-
gators, research scientists, post-doctoral fellows, tech-
nicians, and students. Many projects rely on the Ge-
nomics and Bioinformatics Core Facilities housed in the

mestication. In Europe alone there are approximately
50 recognised breeds. However, virtually nothing is
known about timing, location and manner of goose
domestication, and how it compares to domestication
of other species. This will be the ﬁrst detailed study
of these phenomena. We will use molecular markers

mestic as well as archaeological specimens. The project
brings together multidisciplinary expertise in popula-
tion and conservation genetics (Minna Ruokonen, Uni-
versity of Oulu), phylogeography (Jeremy Searle, Uni-
versity of York/Cornell University), livestock domesti-

UOxford Phylogeography
DPhil Studentship in Indian Ocean Biomolecular Ar-
chaeology
Applications are invited for an ERC-funded DPhil stu-
dentship to investigate the translocation of commen-
sal small mammals in the ancient Indian Ocean. The
project will work within the framework of phylogeog-
raphy to infer ancient pathways of colonisation and
interaction. Three common commensal animals that
are now widely distributed in the Indian Ocean, and
likely hold clues to ancient patterns of human seafaring,
trade, migration and colonization, may be investigated:
the black rat Rattus rattus, the house mouse Mus mus-36 EvolDir January 1, 2010
culus and the house shrew Suncus murinus. The 3-year
studentship is oﬀered as part of the SEALINKS Project,
which is taking a unique interdisciplinary approach to
maritime prehistory, drawing on archaeology, molecu-
lar genetics and historical linguistics methods. The stu-
dentship will be of particular appeal to students whose
interests bridge the humanities and natural sciences.
The selected student will undertake background re-
search in archaeology, biogeography and molecular ge-
netics, ﬁeldwork in South Asia, Southeast Asia and
Africa to collect samples, and laboratory work employ-
ing molecular genetics techniques. The project will be
based between the University of Oxford (archaeology)
and Cornell University (molecular genetics), with the
student receiving an Oxford DPhil. Candidates should
hold or expect to hold, by the time of the project start
date, a very good honours degree (at least a 2.1 or
equivalent) or Masters degree in a relevant subject, and
a strong background in either the biological sciences
or archaeology. They will receive appropriate training,
but should also be self-motivated. The student will be
jointly supervised by Dr. Nicole Boivin (Oxford) and
Prof. Jeremy Searle (Cornell).
The studentship covers the full cost of a home/EU stu-
dent (tuition, college fees, and living expenses). Fund-
ing for ﬁeldwork is also available.
Requests for further information should be directed to
Dr. Boivin or Prof. Searle (who will transfer from York
to Cornell in October 2010). Start date: October 2010.
For further details about the Sealinks Project see:

Evo-Devo of tooth replacement in ﬁsh
Supervisors: Dr Gareth Fraser
Key words: Fish Evo-Devo, Malawi cichlids, sharks,
dental diversity, tooth development
Project Description
The complex process of tooth replacement varies across
vertebrates. At present we know little of the genetic
underpinnings of tooth replacement in any vertebrate.
Fish oﬀer exceptional developmental models for tooth
regeneration with continuous tooth production. Unlike
mammals, ﬁsh replace their teeth continually through
life with a constant production of new teeth. Among
ﬁsh groups the system of repeated tooth production
diﬀers. Sharks have a unique tooth replacement sys-
tem where a conveyer-belt of multiple preformed teeth
replaces each functional tooth in the dentition. Most
teleosts exhibit a diﬀerent system, where a single re-
placement tooth forms to replace each functional tooth.
We are interested in the genetic network that acts to
regulate tooth replacement and we ask how these net-
works can evolve to facilitate the diversity of tooth
replacement across vertebrates. Our recent work has
characterised a gene network associated with regulat-
ing an essential dental stem cell niche,from which new
replacement teeth are born. This studentship will focus
on the developmental basis of tooth replacement in a
range of ﬁsh models including Malawi cichlids and the
catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula, to discover how these
complex and conserved gene networks can alter to pro-
duce diverse tooth replacement mechanisms across ver-
tebrates.
This is laboratory-based with the successful appli-
cant receiving training in developmental biological tech-January 1, 2010 EvolDir 37
niques, including in situ hybridisation, microscopy and
genetic manipulation. Applicants should have, or ex-
pect to obtain at least a 2:1 degree in a relevant sub-

UValencia RotiferCoEvolution
Spanish Research Training Fellowship for Population
Biology Studies
Institute Cavanilles of Biodiversity and Evolutionary
Biology (ICBiBE)
University of Valencia (Spain)
The Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCI)
will open a call for the so-called FPI (Formaci´ on de
Personal Investigador) Fellowship Program in January
2010. One of these fellowships is associated to the re-
search project ‘Implications of the environmental and
demographic ﬂuctuations on the coexistence of cryp-
tic rotifer species‘, leaded by Manuel Serra ( http:/-
/www.uv.es/ ˜ serram/ ) at the Evolutionary Ecology
Laboratory - ICBiBE ( http://www.uv.es/ ˜ biodiver/-
v/index.htm ).
The project focuses on the hypothesis that salinity ﬂuc-
tuations, besides demographic ﬂuctuations caused by
the life cycle, allow stable coexistence of zooplankters
with high similarity in their resource exploitation and
predation vulnerability. Methods and techniques in-
volved in this project are pond sampling, taxonomic
identiﬁcation using molecular markers, laboratory ex-
periments using chemostats, modelling of ecological and
evolutionary processes, and advanced statistical analy-
sis. Therefore, a strong background in population ecol-
ogy and evolution is required to be awarded with the
above mentioned fellowship. Skills in statistics, pop-
ulation genetics, molecular biology and computer pro-
gramming are welcome.
Details will be given in the oﬃcial call made by MCI.
However, based in previous calls, the fellowship is ex-
pected to have the following features:
(1) The fellowship will provide support for four years.
(2) The fellow will follow post-graduate studies (mas-ter and doctorate for fellows with a BS, or doctorate
for fellows with a MSc; http://www.uv.es/postgrau/-
index.htm ) at the University of Valencia.
(3) Eligible students must have a degree, obtained af-
ter January 1, 2006, which allow them the access to
post-graduate studies at the University of Valencia.
(4) The time window to submit applications will be ﬁf-
teen days after the call is opened.
(5) The fellow is expected to start his/her work in
September 2010.
Students interested in applying for the fellowship
should e-mail Manuel Serra (manuel.serra@uv.es; cc:
Mar´ ıa Jos´ e Carmona <maria.j.carmona@uv.es >), stat-
ing his/her interest, and enclosing his/her CV. Those
applicants with a degree obtained outside the European
Space for Higher Education should obtain degree recog-
nition at the University of Valencia before application
submission to MCI.

Abstract of the Project: One of the major threats to
human and animal health as well as to agronomy is the
emergence of new infectious diseases, most of which are
caused by RNA viruses. RNA viruses show a remark-
able evolvability owed to their large population size,
short generation times and high mutation and recombi-
nation rates. Understanding the mechanisms by which
a virus becomes an emerging one is thus pivotal for
the rational design of antiviral therapies and control
strategies. In this project we are interested in learning
what are the population genetic mechanisms determin-
ing the emergence of new viruses and what changes,
both in viral genome and in the plant-virus interaction,
take place during the process of emergence and adap-
tation to the new host. We will take an experimental
approach using the Tobacco etch potyvirus as model
system complemented with evolutionary genetics anal-
yses and with an in silico Systems Biology modeling
approach. First, we will characterize the distributionof mutational eﬀects and epistatic interactions among
pairs of random mutations across potential hosts and
test predictions of models recently proposed to this end.
Second, we will perform a large-scale evolution exper-
iment simulating the process of emergence of an RNA
virus in a population of genetically heterogeneous hosts.
From this experiment and the corresponding analyses,
we will learn: (i) about the constraints imposed by dif-
ferent hosts and the speciﬁcity of adaptation, (ii) about
the reproducibility of evolution at the phenotypic and
molecular level and about the targets of selection in
the viral genome, (iii) about the cellular components
(genes and networks of interactions) to which viruses
adapt and how their manipulation may result in viru-
lence, and (iv) by comparing our transcriptomic data,
and an inferred model of host interactome, with those
obtained for other viruses infecting the same host, we
will try to elucidate whether phylogenetically related
viruses target the same components in the host inter-
actome while unrelated viruses target widely diﬀerent
components. Finally, by using the new ultra-deep py-
rosequencing technologies, we will obtain an unprece-
dented description of how virus genetic variability is
generated, distributes spatially on diﬀerent plant tis-
sues and evolves within a single infected host plant.
Requirements: We are seeking for a person genuinely
interested in developing a scientiﬁc career in an inter-
disciplinary area where Virology, Evolutionary Genet-
ics and Systems Biology merge. The candidate must
be a very motivated person, with skills for working in
a dynamic international group, initiative and absolute
disponibility. In particular, we are interested in stu-
dents holding a BSc (or equivalent) degree in Biology,
Biochemistry or alike, with graduation after January
1st, 2005. An outstanding academic record is neces-
sary. In addition, previous experience in Evolutionary
Genomics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics will
be positively valorized.
Deadline for submission. The exact days for submis-
sion have not yet been published by the Ministry, but
it will be likely open by mid January 2005. More
information can be obtained at the Ministry of Science

Field assist Great tits Switzerland
I am seeking enthusiastic candidates interested in as-
sisting a ﬁeld study on Great tits in Bern, Switzerland.The study aims to study the inﬂuence of avian preda-
tors, through maternal eﬀects, on life-history traits of
Great tits, and possible additional eﬀects on the ec-
toparasites of the tits. The great tits are a good sys-
tem to examine the eﬀects of predators and ectopara-
sites on life-history of birds since they readily accept
nest boxes making them easy to manipulate and fol-
low from egg laying to oﬀspring ﬂedging. I will re-
quire 3 ﬁeld assistants that will help with all the as-
pects of the work, including ringing the birds, sim-
ulating predators, conducting behavioral observations
and recordings, and more. The study will take place
in a forest near Bern, starting roughly at mid-March
2010, and running until around the end of May 2010.
Applicants with a BSc/Msc in Biology/Ecology and
with bird handling experience would have an advan-
tage. However, motivation will play a key role: the
work is hard and demanding, may take place in chang-
ing weather and requires long hours at times. Mo-
tivated applicants could develop their own individual
research on a topic related to the program and their
own interests, and if particularly motivated could be in-
volved in the publications. Accommodation and trans-
portation within Europe will be provided. Some ﬁ-
nancial assistance will also be available to cover liv-
ing expenses. Candidates must hold a valid Euro-
pean driving license. For further details please contact

France evolution
Dear all
This is to inform you about an attractive job oﬀer
in France the yearly announcement of researcher po-
sitions ﬁnanced by the French Funding Organization
Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS).
These are *life-time 100 % research* positions of-
fered in an international competition to excellent can-
didates. The web page is http://www.sg.cnrs.fr/-
drhchercheurs/concoursch/default-en.htm . Posts are
available, for instance in section 20 Continental Sur-
faces and Interfaces (which to some degree includes
ecosystem, landscape or palaeo ecology), section 29 Bio-
diversity, evolution and biological adaptations: from
macromolecules to communities, and in interdisci-
plinary committees 43 and 44. The deadline, regret-
tably, is January, 5.
THE TYPES OF POSTS (see also
http://www.sg.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/-pdf/guide-en.pdf, http://www.sg.cnrs.fr/-
drhchercheurs/concoursch/pdf/metier-en.pdf including
salaries): There are 2nd and 1st degree chargs
de recherche and 2nd and 1st degree directeurs de
recherche, i.e. Associate Scientists after dissertation
and after some years of postdoctoral experience, and Se-
nior Scientists after about 8 or more years of experience,
respectively. Please note that the announced posts of
directeurs de recherche, may in reality be less numerous
than announced. In the past these posts were usually
de facto only for promotion of people that already have
a position of a charg drecherche within CNRS. This
year this seems to improve.
According to my experience already the Chargs de
Recherche are actually free to do what they want within
an overall, very large disciplinary category (there are
some 40 categories deﬁned for all sciences together).
The competition for such positions is tough, in partic-
ular in the section 29 Biodiversity, evolution and bio-
logical adaptations: from macromolecules to communi-
ties. Even though strange things are happening, mul-
tiple ﬁrst or senior authored publications per year each
with an impact factor of 4 or more seem to be useful,
and Nature, Science, PNAS are highly appreciated.
Further criteria (in French) are given at http:/-
/www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/sections/critere/-
section29.htm THE PROFILES If you go to http:/-
/gestionoﬀres.dsi.cnrs.fr/fo/oﬀres/default-en.php you
will ﬁnd a number of posts oﬀered, e.g. in the in
the sections 20, 29, 45. Note that by further clicking
on the numbers given to the jobs (e.g. N29/02)
you will ﬁnd that the Charg´ e positions (Associate
Scientists) are often focused to more restricted ﬁelds
of research. This is where often science politics comes
into play. But sometimes the proﬁles only indicate a
preference in case two equally strong candidates show
up. Very strong candidates that have little to do with
a published proﬁle may in cases be preferred over weak
candidates that perfectly match a proﬁle, in particular
in competitive sections.
THE RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE. Deadline for
applications is, regrettably, January 5. A visit to the
lab after having submitted the application seems to be
very much expected in all cases. Generally, French
institutions *do not* reimburse candidates the travel
costs to visit labs or to come to interviews etc. Yes,
this is a shame. We likely have some funds here at
Rennes to pay for expenses.
Each application must contain a scientiﬁc project this
project needs to be compatible with the host lab you
apply to.January 1, 2010 EvolDir 45
After having applied *all* eligible candidates will be
invited to a short presentation and an interview in
Paris in spring 2009. The tentative dates are given
onhttp://www.sg.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/-
pdf/Calendrier 2010.pdf .
Candidates should be available for the dates indicated.
Travel costs will *not* be reimbursed by the CNRS,
but at the level of host Units funds may be available.
Presentations and interviews can be in English, French
is possibly a plus. These interviews are a major eﬀort
for both, the candidates, the local labs and the national
recruitment committees. For people from abroad it is
thus strongly advised to apply only if they are con-
vinced of their CVs.
I PERSONALLY COULD OFFER help in putting to-
gether an application for qualiﬁed candidates with a
project willing to choose University of Rennes 1 and
to work here (at least partly) on the interface between
ecology and phylogeny (preferably involving plants but
also other taxa). My personal web page (somewhat

TENURE POSITION IN ECOLOGY: UNIVERSITY
OF ANTWERP
The University of Antwerp has a tenure position in
Ecology and Environment, with closing date 21 de-
cember 2009. The position is open to researchers in
a number of broad ﬁelds, including Ecology & Envi-
ronment. The position is highly competitive, aiming at
researchers with a strong publication record and expe-
rience in obtaining grants, and a PhD obtained after 1
Oct 2003. The general idea is that candidates should
be at the level corresponding to ERC starting grant ap-
plications. Candidates have to submit a research plan
that should ﬁt in the general theme of Ecology & En-
vironment, and that also ﬁts within the activities of
one of the research groups in the Faculty (for example
the Evolutionary Ecology group). Although the ap-
plication does not have to be supported by a particu-
lar staﬀ member, it is nevertheless advisable to discuss
the research plan with an eligible group to maximize
the chances. The Evolutionary Ecology Group (Herwig
Leirs, Erik Matthysen, Stefan Van Dongen) is particu-
larly interested in a combination of population biology
and modelling, but all options are open. The applica-
tion requires a cv and research plan. More information

tablished Institute for Evolutionary Biology and Envi-
ronmental Sciences at the University of Zurich ( http:/-
/www.zm.uzh.ch/agwilson/ ) is seeking a research assis-
tant for a one-year project investigating the reproduc-
tive ecology of nearshore ﬁshes, starting in February
2010.
Our group concentrates on the role of sexual selection
in the speciation process. Integrating molecular phylo-
genetic, population genetic and functional genomic ap-
proaches, our work spans a broad temporal scale in an
eﬀort to derive testable hypotheses on the evolution of
taxonomic diversity. Over the past several years, our re-
search has concentrated on syngnathid ﬁshes (seahorses
and pipeﬁsh), a group of particular interest due to spe-
cialized morphological adaptations for male parental
care and female-dominated competition for access to
mates. This work involves ongoing collaborations with
researchers in America, Europe and Australia.
The research assistant will be involved in a project
studying the inﬂuence of fecundity selection on body
size variation in populations of Syngnathus pipeﬁsh.
Recent research has documented a positive association
between ambient water temperature, body size and fe-
cundity in nearshore pipeﬁsh species (Wilson 2009).
The researcher will investigate this hypothesis in Eu-
ropean pipeﬁshes (Rispoli & Wilson 2008), combining
the analysis of historical collections with ﬁeld and com-
mon garden experiments investigating the role of am-
bient water temperature on growth rates and develop-
ment times of captive-reared populations. This project
is ideally suited for a recent Masters graduate interested
in questions of evolutionary ecology in aquatic systems.
Interested candidates should submit a Curriculum vi-
tae and statement of research interests, along with a
list of references, by email or post to Tony Wilson
(tony.wilson@zm.uzh.ch) before January 15, 2010. Any
questions on the position can also be directed to Prof.

Dear Colleagues,
Has anyone found a less cumbersome interface than Se-
quin for preparing large batches ( >200 individuals) of
sequence data to GenBank. I’ve spent days tearing my
hair out in the past trying to make Sequin work, and
am dreading doing it again.
Along those lines, I would be interested in hearing
about the experience of other submitters in dealing
with GenBank submissions and subsequent processing
of your annotations.

Dear EVOLDIR members,
I am currently starting my PhD supervised by Tatiana
Giraud at the University of Paris 11. I am working on
the population genetic structure of /Malus sylvestris/
(wild apple tree of Europe, known as the European
Crabapple) in France to open perspectives of biocon-
servation in a long term. I am planning to extend my
study to the European scale. I already have in hands
samples of /M. sylvestris/ from several countries but
I would like to increase the number of locations repre-
sented in my dataset.
More precisely, I would need wild individuals from nat-
ural forests in Europe, with a minimum of 5-10 individ-
uals per location.
I would really appreciate if someone could help me in
this task, by providing sample, or giving me geograph-
ical locations where I could get some.
Thanks a lot for your help,

Arthropod Genomics Consortium
Participants at the annual symposium sponsored by
the Arthropod Genomics Center at Kansas State
University formed the Arthropod Genomics Consor-
tium to increase collaboration and information ex-
change among the community of scientists perform-
ing genomic studies on arthropods. We are de-
veloping a wiki, at http://arthropodgenomes.org <
http://arthropodgenomes.org/ >, to help the com-
munity self-assemble. Our goal is to provide a cen-
tral location for information about arthropod genomics
projects, bioinformatics tools, and people interested in
arthropod genomics. We think this is a great way to
“identify the community”; information from the wiki
can be used to support white papers and grant propos-
als. It will also serve as a central location for links to
arthropod genomics resources, news releases and meet-
ing announcements.
We have constructed the initial wiki pages,
which include templates for entering your in-
formation. Please take a moment to visit
the wiki, http://arthropodgenomes.org <
http://arthropodgenomes.org/ >, register and
enter information about yourself and the organism or
problems you study. Even if you don’t work directly
on a genome project, we would like to know how you
would beneﬁt from genome level knowledge. If you
do work on a genome project, please list the genomic
resources that currently exist for your organism(s)
and what resources are needed or planned. Please
encourage your colleagues to participate.
To organize such a large area, we have set up four
main working groups based on research interest: 1)
plant pests and beneﬁcials, 2) vectors of disease, 3)
Evo/Devo, and 4) EcoGen/PopGen. Your interests or
research organism may fall into multiple categories. If
so, you can list more than one.
Thank you for your participation.

Behaviour videos
I am guest-curating a section of an upcoming exhibition
of works from the Grinnell College’s collections for our
art gallery which is loosely centered around the emo-
tional context of depictions of animals. As part of this,
I’d like to have a looping presentation of animal behav-
ior on video, ranging from art ﬁlm, to “nature shows”,
to unedited footage of behavior used by for quantita-
tive analyses. The idea is for viewers to consider how
our response to animals is aﬀected by movement itself
and the context of the presentation (e.g., editing cuts,
music, commentary etc.)
If you are willing to donate clips of your research video
for this eﬀort, I’d be happy to use them. I’m interested
in both video of animals in natural settings (better if60 EvolDir January 1, 2010
they are animals that are not familiar to the lay person)
and video which isolates organisms in artiﬁcial environ-
ments (e.g., ﬁsh in tanks, spiders in arenas, etc.).
Give the size of digital video ﬁles, I’d appreciate it if
you would contact me ﬁrst to describe what you have,
and we can then ﬁgure a way for me either to download
it or have it sent to an email account that can accept
large ﬁles.
Many thanks,

Database diArkDear colleague!
Recently, we have launched a major upgrade of diArk
(www.diark.org ), a resource for eukaryotic genome re-
search. DiArk has been developed for researches work-
ing in any ﬁeld related to eukaryotic genomics. It pro-
vides the most comprehensive and complete compila-
tion of eukaryotic genome and EST sequencing projects
worldwide. We do not only provide extensive search
options, but also many meta-data like assembly cov-
erage, genome data release dates, and BLAST search
services. These data are very important, because the
diﬀerent databases (Broad, DOE-JGI, Sanger, NCBI,
etc.) often provide access to diﬀerent versions of the
genomes (via their BLAST or ftp pages). We also pro-
vide downloads of genome data (contigs, supercontigs,
mitochondrions, chromosomes, and many other types)
of species submitted to NCBI.
Compared to the release of the ﬁrst version in 2007,
there are the following substantial changes:
Content: December 2009 (July 2007 in brackets)
Species: 680 (516) Projects: 1421 (984) genomic DNA
projects: 479 (299) Publications: 350 (269) genome
ﬁles: 1500 ﬁles analysed, 240 GB of fasta ﬁles for down-
load
These numbers do not include the many new releases
and updates of already sequenced genomes!
Functionality: New search module: Genomes, allows
searching for genome ﬁle release dates, coverage, GC-
content, speciﬁc genome types (mitochondrial, chromo-
somal, chloroplast, apicoplast, etc.), and more. New re-
sult modules: Genome-ﬁle: all genome ﬁles (including
ﬁles from all sequencing centers) were analysed, pro-
viding information about type, version, assembly-date,
completeness, coverage, GC-content, size (GBp), con-
tig numbers, illegal characters, accession numbers, com-
ments. Many minor improvements.
Thus: >160 eucaryotes have been sequenced and as-
sembled in the last 2 years, 80 analyses of eucaryotic
genomes have been published. It is obvious that se-
quencing is much faster than analysing. diArk has
become the most important database for eukaryotic
genomes.
We would be happy if diArk would be useful for your
research.
With best wishes,

Kollmar)

Dear Amazon,
I strongly object to Amazon’s product description for62 EvolDir January 1, 2010
the book: “Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evi-
dence for Intelligent Design”.
Author: Stephen C. Meyer
Amazons description states:
“One hundred ﬁfty years ago, Charles Darwin revo-
lutionized biology, but did he refute intelligent design
(ID)? In Signature in the Cell, Stephen Meyer argues
that he did not.”
This is a lie. Based on his discovery of incalculable
numbers of examples of the process of transmutation of
species, Charles Darwin’s great scientiﬁc work, On The
Origin Of Species, presented his thesis that the (then
current) belief that species were unchanging parts of a
designed hierarchy was discredited.
On The Origin Of Species presents the founding facts
on which many new areas of scientiﬁc enquiry are based.
Daily, scientists today make discoveries that underpin
new understanding and success in human endeavours
as varied as history, medicine, agriculture and biology.
These scientiﬁc discoveries and technologies would sim-
ply not be possible without Darwins discovery of the
facts of evolution by natural selection.
Amazons description also states:
confusion surrounds the theory of intelligent design.
Frequently misrepresented by the media, politicians,
and local school boards, intelligent design can be de-
fended on purely scientiﬁc grounds in accordance with
the same rigorous methods that apply to every pro-
posed origin-of-life theory.
This is also a lie. Judge John E. Jones, was very suc-
cinct and clear in his Conclusion to the case that he
heard [Tammy Kitzmiller, et al. v. Dover Area School
District, et al.]. He wrote:
“ ... we have addressed the seminal question of whether
ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and
moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its cre-
ationist, and thus religious, antecedents ... ”
This view is also the most widely held view in the sci-
entiﬁc community. The following link will refer you on
to the majority scientiﬁc views:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-
Intelligent design#cite note-unscientiﬁc-12 Whatever
Signature in the Cell is, it is not the work of science its
author claims. Amazon’s classiﬁcation, presentation
and description of this book are based on falsehoods.
I have no objection to Mr. Meyer, or his book. He is
perfectly entitled to disseminate his personal religious,
philosophical and political opinions, and it must con-
tinue to be listed on Amazon.However, your customers deserve better. The listing
of Signature in the Cell should reﬂect its religious and
political nature.
May I suggest a description along the following lines?
150 years ago Charles Darwin revolutionized science
through his discovery of evolution by natural selection.
In Signature in the Cell Stephen Meyer makes a com-
prehensive case for his philosophical hypothesis that the
theory of intelligent design can be based upon recent
discoveries in DNA, and cellular biology V and that this
supports his fundamental objections to the adequacy
of all purely naturalistic or materialistic descriptions of
the natural, physical, world in which we live.
Meyer embarks on an investigation of DNA and evo-
lution from the foundation of his own beliefs. He con-
cludes that current evolutionary theories are lacking,
and he reﬂects on the evidence that he presents and
the arguments that, ultimately, led him to support in-
telligent design (ID).
Clearly deﬁning his meaning of what ID is and is not,
Meyer attempts to demonstrate that the minority argu-
ment for intelligent design theory is not based on igno-
rance or “giving up on science,” but instead upon our
growing scientiﬁc knowledge of the information stored
in the cell.
A leading proponent of intelligent design (a presen-
tation of the mature theories of creationism and the
teleological arguments for Theism), Meyer presents a
compelling case that will generate heated debate, and
command attention, from deists and theists around the
world.

Gradualism: Darwin’s biggest mistake?
Prof. Richard Bateman - Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
and University of Birmingham
The Linnean Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly,64 EvolDir January 1, 2010
London Wednesday 9th December 2009, 6 pm (follow-
ing AGM at 5pm)
The meeting is open to visitors. Wine will be served
after the lecture to members and guests. Please adver-
tise this lecture as widely as you can. The associations’
AGM will be held before the lecture at 5pm.
Abstract: Although Darwin’s many achievements have
been justly lauded worldwide during 2009, his repeated
assertions that all evolutionary change is impercepti-
bly gradual have escaped serious criticism from mod-
ern commentators. The evidence that gradual change
results in speciation is circumstantial in even the best
documented cases, and usually relies on inadequate as-
sessments of ﬁtness. In contrast, saltational mecha-
nisms requiring that radical and instantaneous pheno-
typic change leads directly to de facto speciation are
still widely ridiculed in most biological constituencies,
despite accumulating evidence of their viability. This
lecture aims to redress the balance between gradual and
non-gradual evolutionary change.

and AGM 9thDec 2
Dear EvoDir,
The title of Richard Bateman’s upcoming lecture is
“Gradualism: Darwin’s big mistake?”.
I may be jumping the gun, the question mark hints at a
lecture debunking this myth (though the abstract sug-
gests something else), but I can’t help but express some
frustration over the habit of evolutionary biologists of
enhancing their research programs (or presidential lec-
tures) by claiming to address mistakes or solve diﬃcul-
ties in the Origin of Species.
Darwin had no problem with rapid evolution.
Page 148: “.... a new and improved variety might be
quickly formed on any one spot, ....”
Page 310: “I may here recall a remark formerly made,
namely that it might require a long succession of ages
to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line oflife, for instance to ﬂy through the air; but when this
had been eﬀected, and a few species had thus acquired a
great advantage over other organisms, a comparatively
short time would be necessary to produce many diver-
gent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and
widely throughout the world.”
Page 318: “There is some reason to believe that or-
ganisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change
more quickly than those that are low: ....”
And then there’s the ﬁrst chapter, Variation under
domestication. It sets up the whole argument and
it is a discussion about variation between diﬀerent
sheep herds and about dog breeds. Darwin remarks
(page 93) that “King Charles’s spaniel has been uncon-
sciously modiﬁed to a large extent since the time of that
monarch”.
Let’s give the man a little rope. The common view
in 1859, according to Darwin, was the immutability of
species. That gradualism was emphasized shouldn’t be
surprising in this context.

VolunteerFieldAssist
RhesusMonkeys
Two ﬁeld assistants for rhesus monkey research on Cayo
Santiago, Puerto Rico.
We are looking for two volunteers to assist on a
project examining kin recognition on a semi free-
ranging rhesus macaque population on Cayo Santi-
ago, Puerto Rico. The project is being undertaken
in the Lab of Dr Anja Widdig, Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig (Germany) (see
http://www.eva.mpg.de/pks/index.html ). The volun-
teers will work alongside Dr Dana Pfeﬀerle ( http://-
www.eva.mpg.de/pks/ﬁles/people.html ).
The successful applicants will be expected to work on
Cayo Santiago for 5-6 days a week, and are also re-
quired to undertake data entry and/ or processing in
the later afternoon and early evenings. The volunteer
assisting in the ﬁrst project will collect behavioral data
using focal observations. For this project it is necessary
to learn up to 400 animals, living in diﬀerent groups.January 1, 2010 EvolDir 65
The second volunteer will help carrying out playback
experiments as well as record rhesus macaque vocaliza-
tions. For this project it is necessary to learn to identify
about 150 animals. Appropriate training will be pro-
vided, after which a good quantum of independence is
expected.
We prefer applicants that stay for the entire period of
6 month. However, in the case of two very good appli-
cations for the second projects, a split into two times
three months might be possible. Please apply only for
one of the two projects (specify in your application!). If
you apply for the second one, please mention the period
of time you are interested to volunteer.
Applicants should have a Bachelor in Biology, Ecology,
Animal Behavior, Physical Anthropology, Primatology,
or a related ﬁeld. Previous ﬁeld experiences (preferably
in the tropics) and knowledge of Spanish is helpful, but
not necessary. In general, applicants must be in good
physical and mental condition; feel comfortable being
far away from family and friends; be emotionally ma-
ture, energetic, and very patient; have an excellent eye
for detail; dont be afraid of approaching monkeys (!);
willing to work in a small team setting and follow in-
structions; be able to maintain a positive and humorous
attitude towards challenging and tiring work.
The language in our team is English. The successful
candidate must have medical insurance, a valid IACUC
certiﬁcate ( www.citiprogram.org ) and a TB-test.
At the moment there is NO ﬁnancial support available.
It is aimed that accommodation costs are shared by
the two candidates (450 UD-$/ month for two people).
However, if for whatever reason, this is not possible, one
candidate needs to be able to pay the entire rent. After
very good performance and upon approval of pending
grant application, we might be able to partially oﬀset
some of the living costs.
Term of Appointment: 10th March until 30th August
2010
Application Deadline: 10th of January 2010
Comments: To apply, candidates should email a brief
cover letter outlining their interests, experience, and
why they wish to join one of the two projects. They
should attach a CV which includes at least contact de-
tails of one academic reference. Please only send email
applications.

It’s called Peak Scanner. Does some of the same things
that you can do in Genotyper or Genescan - but better
because it’s free. I’ve been using Peak Scanner lately,
it’s very user friendly - quite simple really, in practice
and scope, which may or may not be a limitation for
some people. It seems to work great for me. Hope this
helps.
>Strand from the University of Davis which is very sta-
ble software and quite user-friendly once you learn how
it works. You can ﬁnd it here:
http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/informatics/strand.php
There is a good user manual and FAQ. It can handle
ﬁles from ABI sequencers both capillary and slap gels.
There is no automatic binning procedure (allele size are
just rounded) but you can export the exact allele size
(in pb) and then binn your alleles using various avail-
able methods, for instance:

sibelletorres@gmail.comMigrate-n SNPs
Dear EvolDir members,
I’m running MIGRATE-n on my SNP dataset using
the old SNP data format to force the model into the
nucleotide (N) option. So, may data looks like this:
N 15 22 Mig. with Snp (15 populations and 22 loci)
2 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 5 5 1 28 Ale-
sund # SNP16 locus with two linked snps Zm751 GA
Zm753 GA ... # SNP20 locus with a single snp Zm751
C Zm753 T ... ...
As you can see I have some SNPs that are linked and
some that are not for 15 locations. All SNP loci are bial-
lelic, but an individual can be heterozygous (e.g. ind. in
SNP20 can either be C, T, or Y). To estimate the migra-
tion rate between the locations I use the “Nucleotide-
polymorphisms” datatype model made for SNPs. If I
start the program it runs OK, however there is prob-
lem. The “Nucleotide-polymorphisms” model uses the
same options as the “Sequence” datatype model. So,
you must specify a transition/transversion ratio (ttra-
tio) for the SNP loci. I don’t see how that is possible
with biallelic loci, and if I run the program in default
it comes up with really weird numbers for the ttratio.
For instance, for SNP20 the base frequencies are (A C G
T): 0.0000 0.8495 0.0000 0.1505 and the ttratio becomes
7825166227520571519795200.0000 !!!!! With the linked
SNPs this problem is less severe because you have, in
general, more then two bases (MIGRATE-n handles the
linked SNPs as a sequence).
Has anybody working with MIGRATE-n and SNP
datasets encountered similar problems and what would
be the eﬀect from this on the estimates of migration?
Any suggestions and tips will be greatly appreciated.

Pheidole microsatellite primers
Dear all,
I am a graduate student working on caste determina-
tion in Pheidole ants. One of the dissertation projects I
am interested in pursuing examines potential patriline-
biased eﬀects on the production of diﬀerent worker
castes in P. spadonia, P. rhea, and P.obtusospinosa. We
have currently found one microsatellite primer (Ppal-
77) that is suitable for such a study but am having trou-
ble ﬁnding additional primers that will help strengthen
conclusions drawn from my study. We have also tried
Ppal-03, Ppal-33, and Pmeg-11 but these markers did
not yield any alleles or showed alleles that are not vari-
able in the three Pheidole species above.
Ppal-77, Ppal-33, and Ppal-03 were used in:
Fournier et al. (2002) Investigation of the population
genetic structure and mating system in the ant Pheidole
pallidula. Molecular Ecology. 11: 1805-1814.
Pmeg-11 was used in:
Fournier et al. (2008) Isolation and characterization of
microsatellite loci from the invasive ant Pheidole mega-
cephala. Molecular Ecology Resources. 8: 919-922.
Is anyone familiar with the other primers listed in the
two papers above? If so, which ones may be worth test-
ing in my three species of interest? Or, are you aware of
any other cross-species microsatellite primers used on
closely related species that may work? Please contact
me at mhuang@ag.arizona.edu if you have any advice.
Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Query for Drierite
Dear EvolDir members,
I am a Ph.D. student working on Drosophila
melanogaster. I would like to do a desiccation assayon the Drosophila populations maintained in my lab.
I have several queries in this regard and require your
guidance.
1) I would be using Drierite as a desiccant in these
assays. There are several varieties of drierites commer-
cially available with particles of 4-mesh, 6-mesh and
8-mesh size. Now which particle size should I use for
the assay. I would be doing the assay in glass vials of
dimension 30cm length x 9cm diameter, with 10 ﬂies in
each vial.
2) While doing this assay, can inclusion of desiccant in
the vials ensure complete dryness? Or do we have to
keep the vials in a desiccating chamber as well with
provisions of Oxygen supply.
I would be very grateful if you could kindly provide me
these information and help me in this matter.
Thanking You,

Software FamilySim68 EvolDir January 1, 2010
Hi,
The program “Kinship” had a very useful simulation
tool that allowed users to generate simulated individu-
als of known relatedness based on the user’s allele fre-
quencies. These data could then be used to: (1) assess
how much resolution to expect from a given data set (in
terms of detecting relatedness patterns); and (2) gener-
ate distributions of expected values that could be used
for hypothesis testing.
I am not aware of another program that has this func-
tionality, so I have written one. The program is called
“Family-Sim” and can run on Windows or LINUX oper-
ating systems. It takes a user’s allele frequency ﬁle and
generates a user-deﬁned number of pairs of individuals
of known relatedness (parent-oﬀspring, full-sibs, half-
sibs, and unrelated). The output is a genotype ﬁle of
these individuals that can be run through any related-
ness program. I imagine (or at least hope!) that this
will be useful to a large number of people, particularly
given that these simulations can be analyzed by any
relatedness program, rather than being limited to Kin-
ship.
There is not, and will not likely be, a paper describ-
ing this program, but it can be downloaded at the fol-
lowing site: http://web.me.com/tfrasier/Frasier Lab/-

Hi Alessia,
I’ve just been investigating AFLP scoring software my-
self - I’m doing AFLPs on a bunch of orchid speciesJanuary 1, 2010 EvolDir 69
and don’t have time left in my PhD for scoring it all by
hand! Or the patience =)
Here is my short list of (free) programs to try -
RawGeno - an R package - very quick and easy to use,
takes ﬁles generated by PeakScanner, which is a free
ABI program for looking at .fsa ﬁles . .. but I still
don’t totally understand how it does the scoring, I plan
to check on that more.
AFLPScore - another R-based program, which uses ﬁles
generated by GeneMapper (not free, but maybe you
could make the right ﬁles in PeakScanner) - I haven’t
tried this yet, but it also calculates error rates . ..
tinyFLP - a standalone small program that is very fast
. ..
and there is an R package called AFLPdat for man-
aging AFLP data in R, which sounds really useful but
I also haven’t tried yet (I really have just started on
analysis).
I’ll be really interested to hear what responses you get!
best and good luck,

Hi Alessia,
in June 2009 I published a free package for automated
binning of AFLP data; see ref
Arthofer W. (2009) tinyFLP and tinyCAT: software for
automatic peak selection and scoring of AFLP data ta-
bles. Molecular Ecology Resources,
doi: 10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02751.x.
The software works with exported PeakScanner tables,
so its mandatory that your AFLPs were run on an ABI
platform. It has no fancy interface, but creates relieable
0/1 matrices and inﬁles for MrBayes and Genalex very
fast. Actually, I am working on an additional program
to ﬁnd optimal scoring parameters for a given dataset,
this program will be availabe sometimes in early 2010.
If you want to test the program you can download it

The IMa2 program is available. This is a program for
isolation-with-migration analyses for data from multi-
ple populations. The program was written by Jody Hey,
Sang Chul Choi, and Rasmus Nielsen.
Windows executable, linux/unix/mac archive, source
code, and documentation for IMa2 can be obtained
from the Heylab website
http://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/hey/software#IMa2
IMa2 is for samples for anywhere from 1 to 10
populations. The user must specify the phylogenetic
tree.70 EvolDir January 1, 2010
The program does pretty much everything that the ear-
lier IMa program does, plus several new things. This
means that even people using IMa for two populations
will want to consider using the new program.
Another program, IMﬁg, is a companion program to
IMa2 for generating nice ﬁgures of the Isolation-with-
Migration model that is estimated from their data.
This program is also available from my website
There are two papers that describe these programs and
they are now in press:
Hey, J. in press. Isolation with Migration Models for
more than Two Populations. Molecular Biology and
Evolution in press.

Software P2EMA MicrosatAnalysis
“Dear Evoldir members,
We have noticed some recent posting asking for an open
source microsatellite genotyping software. We have re-
cently developed a PERL pipeline for dealing with mi-
crosatellite data called P2EMA, and would like to make
it open for anyone to try it and tell us how could it be
improved.
P2EMA is a Perl/Tk graphical user interface (GUI)
that facilitates several tasks when scoring microsatel-
lites. It does so by implementing new subroutines in R
and PERL and taking advantage of features provided
by previously developed software such as PeakScan-
ner, CREATE and AlleloBin. P2EMA allows running
PeakScanner easily from the commandline, analysing
markers from several multiplex groups simultaneously,
manual bin deﬁnition through a new R script (Binator),
direct bin deﬁnition through AlleloBin and ﬁle conver-sion through CREATE.
Please, do not hesitate to send us any comments on your
experience with P2EMA and recommendations as how
it could be improved. You can get the P2EMA pipeline
and post your comments at the P2EMA project web-
page:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/p2ema/ An applica-
tion note has been submitted to Bioinformatics:
F Palero, F Gonz´ alez-Candelas and M Pascual (sub-
mitted) P2EMA (Perl Pipeline for Easy Microsatellite
Analysis) – a user-friendly package. Bioinformatics.
Thanks!

SouthAfrica VolunteerFieldAssist
MouseEvolution
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
>From May 2010 onwards
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons of group living, paternal care, communal nesting
and social ﬂexibility in the striped mouse. As this
species is diurnal and the habitat is open, direct be-January 1, 2010 EvolDir 71
havioral observations in the ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are also expected to help with
maintenance of the research station (water pump, solar
power, etc.)
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 90 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. For students with their
own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250 (ap-
prox. 110 Euro) per month applies. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
2000 or 170 Euro/month). Including extras, you should
expect costs of about 300 Euros per month. Students
get an invitation letter which they can use to apply for
funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany,
SANW in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for volunteers to start in May 2010 and especially for
the period June to November 2010. Volunteers are ex-
pected to stay at least 2 months, but longer periods of
up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch.More information under www.stripedmouse.com Con-
tact via e-mail: carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch

WORKING AS A FIELD ASSISTANT IN GOEGAP
NATURE RESERVE
A report by Romy H¨ oppli, student at the University of
Zurich, who staid in Goegap June to August 2008
Blue skies without a single cloud for six weeks - rocky
mountains with little vegetation - yellow, orange and
pink ﬁelds of ﬂowers in whatever direction you look
- small mammals, lizards and birds in our front yard
and Mountain Zebras, Springbok and Ostrich right next
door...
This was my time at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-
tion in Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa! During
six weeks from the beginning of July until the middle of
August I’ve been living here, studying mice, experienc-
ing nature like never before and being part of a small
community where there was always something to laugh
and joke about!
After arriving in Goegap, right the next morning my
scientiﬁc adventure in South Africa began: Setting and
checking traps, nest observations and radio-tracking
were our daily routine. While I got bitten by the mice
quite often in the beginning and my right middle ﬁn-
ger was scarred all over, I improved quickly shaking the
mice out of the traps, weighing them and checking the
number of the ear tag. Other duties like cleaning the
cages of the mice in the captive colony, washing the dirt
from probably several months out of the traps, paint-
ing the new Wendy House and putting in a ﬂoor and
curtains quickly added to our daily ﬁeld work activities.

AarhusU FishPopulationsGenetics
Postdoc in Fish Populations Genetics and Genomics
A three-year postdoctoral position will be available at
the Department of Biological Sciences, Aarhus Univer-
sity, Denmark, starting 1 March 2010 or as soon as
possible.
The appointed postdoc will assist Michael M. Hansen
(Head of Department) in his research, teaching and stu-
dent supervision activities. A major part of the re-
search concerns a project on speciation and footprints
of selection in Atlantic Anguillid eels (European and
American eel). The project involves, among others, a
SNP based genome scan and is partly based on unique
samples of eel larvae collected in the Sargasso Sea.
This is a collaborative project with Thomas Damm Als
and Dorte Bekkevold, Technical University of Denmark,
Silkeborg, and with Louis Bernatchez (Universit´ e Laval,
Quebec, Canada) and Gregory Maes (Catholic Univer-
sity of Leuven, Belgium). Furthermore, a Ph.D. student
will be recruited to the project.
The postdoc will also be involved in other collabo-
rative projects: one with Øystein Skaala and Kevin
Glover (Institute of Marine Research, Norway) con-
cerning QTL mapping of Atlantic salmon in a nat-
ural setting, and another project concerning popula-
tion genetic studies of brown trout, particularly im-
plementation of SNP markers and landscape genetics
(with Dorte Bekkevold, Technical University of Den-
mark, Silkeborg).
Internally at the department there are also excellent rel-
evant collaboration partners, particularly the research
groups of Volker Loeschcke, Cino Pertoldi and Trine
Bilde.
The position furthermore involves participation in
teaching a 3rd-4th year course in Conservation Genet-
ics.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biol-
ogy and/or population genetics and must document
cutting-edge skills in statistical analysis of molecular
markers/population genetic data and excellence in writ-
ing scientiﬁc papers. Applicants who can document
skills in bioinformatics will receive particularly serious
consideration. Finally, applicants should be ambitious,
show strong capabilities for team-work, and should also
be able to take initiatives and responsibility.
Applications should include a CV, publication list, a 1-2 pages description of research experience and research
interests, and the names and contact details of three
persons, who would be willing to send a letter of rec-
ommendation.
The Department of Biological Sciences oﬀers an
ambitious, scientiﬁcally very strong but also so-
cially pleasant working environment. For more in-
formation about the Department of Biological Sci-
ences, see www.biology.au.dk For more infor-
mation about Michael M. Hansen’s research, see

POSTDOC: POPULATION GENETICS OF WILD
POPULATIONS OF MODEL ORGANISMS
A postdoc position is available in the lab of Dr. Uma
Ramakrishnan at the Department of Ecology and Evo-
lution at the National Centre for Biological Sciences,
TIFR, Bangalore, India.
We are interested in the processes governing the re-
sponse of species to environmental history, climatic per-
turbation and human history in the context of species
ecologies, to gain a better understanding of their evo-
lution. In practical terms, our research focuses on re-
vealing the processes that drive patterns of mammalian
genetic variation (in the present and the past). We
use ﬁeld-collected samples, assemble molecular genetic
data and analyze these data with phylogenetic, phy-
lochronologic, phylogeographic and population genetic
inferences. Much of our research over the last few
years has focused on the Indian subcontinent because
of (1) its geographic setting, representing the inter-
section of three major biogeographic realms (Palearc-
tic, Africotropical, Indomalayan); (2) its geologically
dramatic history, driven by plate tectonics, volcanism
and climatic change; (3) its ecologically diverse habi-
tat types from the highest mountains on earth to very
dry deserts and tropical forests, including biodiversity
hotspots; (4) the presence of Homonins in India for74 EvolDir January 1, 2010
perhaps one million years, and modern humans in rel-
atively high (and ever increasing) densities for about
70,000 years impacting the Indian biota; and ﬁnally the
fact that (5) virtually nothing is known about patterns
of genetic variation in native Indian species, and even
less is known about the impact of climate on species in
this region in particular.
Given current advances in genomic methods and tech-
nology, we would like to extend our research to inves-
tigate evolutionary and population level processes in
model organisms (and close relatives) that live in the
wild, such as Mus musculus (house mouse), Rattus rat-
tus (brown rat), Macaca mulata (rhesus macaque) and
Macaca radiata (bonnet macaque). We will start by in-
vestigating population demographic history and struc-
ture and move to signatures or selection and compar-
ative studies between species. For further information,
please contact Uma Ramakrishnan with a CV at ura-
makri@ncbs.res.in.

The Molecular Ecology Work Group at the Martin-
Luther University Halle/Wittenberg ( http://www.mol-
ecol.uni-halle.de ) is oﬀering a PostDoc position in the
BMBF funded project FUGAPIS (pending approval).
The research network FUGAPIS aims to understandthe evolution and dynamics of the host parasite sys-
tems of the honeybee Apis mellifera and two of its
major parasites, Varroa and American foulbrood. By
applying molecular tools like genome mapping in semi
natural populations, which evolved resistance towards
the parasite, we aim to identify genes which are in-

ERC POSTDOCTORAL POSITION ON C. EL-
EGANS EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION FIRST
CALL 15 DECEMBER 2009
A postdoctoral position is available in the lab-
oratory of Henrique Teot ˜A3nio at the Instituto
Gulbenkian de Ci ˜Ancia (IGC), Oeiras Portugal
(www.igc.gulbenkian.pt ).
PROJECT: The research will be focused on the genetic
basis of adaptation to novel environments, in particular
on the evolution of phenotype distributions in hetero-
geneous environments using populations of C. elegans
manipulated in their mating system and standing levels
of genetic variation. We aim to describe adaptation in
life-history, behavioral and gene expression phenotypes,
and correlate them with genome-wide patterns of DNA
sequence variation during long-term experimental evo-
lution. The speciﬁcs of the postdoctoral project will be
deﬁned according to the applicant’s interests and ex-
perience, and collaborations with labs in the USA and
Europe are envisaged.
REQUIREMENTS: PhD in evolutionary genetics and
interest in the topics of adaptation from standing ge-
netic variation, evolution of phenotypic plasticity, and
mating system evolution. The ideal candidate will have
a strong background in quantitative genetics (analy-
sis of selection gradients, estimation of breeding values,
QTL mapping) and the population genetics of DNA
sequence data (comparative analysis of heterozygosity
and linkage disequilibria). Although not essential, ex-
perience with culturing model organisms in the lab is
preferred, as well as experience with basic molecular bi-
ology techniques. The candidates are expected to have
the computational skills to conduct multivariate statis-
tical analysis and data management. Candidates with
a PhD in theoretical evolutionary genetics are invited
to apply.
FUNDING and STARTING DATE: The postdoctoral
position is funded by the European Research Council
(ERC), for a monthly salary of about 2000, plus social
beneﬁts. The successful applicant can start as soon
as March 2010. Yearly evaluations of performance will
determine the renewal of the contract for up to a max-
imum of ﬁve years.APPLICATIONS: Applications should be composed
of a CV including professional experience, list of rel-
evant publications, and list of technical competen-
cies. CVs are to be accompanied by a letter of
motivation and the contact information of two ref-
erees. Applications should be sent by email to

Postdoc: Plastid origins and plant phylogenomics - CC-
MAR, University of the Algarve, Portugal
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
(2nd call for applicants.)
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher
position at the Centro de Ciencias do Mar (CC-
MAR), University of the Algarve (CCMAR - http:/-
/www.ccmar.ualg.pt/ ) in the research group of Cymon
J. Cox (Plant systematics and bioinformatics). The
successful applicant will participate in the project ti-
tled “The origin and early diversiﬁcation of plants: a
phylogenomic approach employing novel composition-
heterogeneous methods” funded by the Portuguese
Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT). The
project will be conducted in collaboration with T.M.
Embley (Newcastle University, UK) and P.G. Foster
(Natural History Museum, London, UK).
Background Plant chloroplasts are derived from an an-
cient endosymbiotic capture of a cyanobacterium by a
heterotrophic eukaryotic ancestor, an event which led
to the diversiﬁcation of three primary plant lineages,
namely, the glaucocystophytes, red algae, and green
plants, and the eventual emergence of terrestrial ecosys-
tems. The endosymbiosis marked a crucial episode
in cell and Earth history, yet our understanding of
the phylogenetic context surrounding this momentous
event remains obscure in part due to the technical limi-
tations of current phylogenetic methodology in relation
to the reconstruction of deep evolutionary divergences.
The project will be conducted entirely “in silico” and
implement novel non-stationary composition models
in a phylogenomic context. The successful candidate
will have a strong background in phylogenetic analy-
ses, Unix/Linux computing, and bioinformatics (biopy-
thon/bioperl, cluster management, relational databas-80 EvolDir January 1, 2010
ing, etc). An extensive publication record will also be
advantageous. The position is available for 3 years (af-
ter an initial 1 year probation) from January 2010 and
is open to all nationalities. The researcher will receive
a salary of 1495 euros/month.
Applications should be submitted before 15th January
2010 to Cymon J. Cox (cymon@ualg.pt). Applicants
should send a covering letter detailing their research
interests, a current C.V., and the email addresses for 3
professional referees. Informal inquires are welcome to
the same address.

Postdoc position in experimental evolution
We seek a postdoc for a collaborative project between
the University of Cologne (Prof. Joachim Krug) and
Wageningen University (Dr. Arjan de Visser) on epis-
tasis, recombination and the predictability of adap-
tive evolution. The project is part of the Collabora-
tive Research Center 680 “Molecular basis of evolu-
tionary innovations” funded by Deutsche Forschungsge-
meinschaft (DFG) ( http://www.sfb680.uni-koeln.de <
http://www.sfb680.uni-koeln.de/ >) and coordinated
at the University of Cologne. Using evolution experi-
ments and the reconstruction of mutational pathways
combined with population genetic theory (see de Visser
et al. 2009 Am. Nat. 174: S15-S30), we seek to de-
velop and test predictions about the molecular basis
of adaptive pathways. As experimental system we will
use TEM-1 beta-lactamase, which causes bacterial re-
sistance to certain classes of antibiotics. We want to use
this system to study the distribution of beneﬁcial mu-
tations, characterize ﬁtness landscapes involving these
mutations, study the eﬀect of recombination on the rate
and level of adaptation, and study factors that enhance
the repeatability of evolutionary pathways in replicate
populations.January 1, 2010 EvolDir 83
Proﬁle: We seek someone with a PhD in molecular
evolutionary biology, microbial genetics or enzyme en-
gineering. Experience with basic microbiological and
molecular lab techniques are an absolute requirement;
experience with evolutionary theory and quantitative
models are an advantage. The postdoc will be ap-
pointed at the University of Cologne, and experimental
work will be carried out primarily at the Laboratory
of Genetics at Wageningen University. The initial ap-
pointment is for one year with the possibility for exten-
sion to up to four years. Salary will be paid according
to level E13 of the German public service salary scale
(TV-L).
Applications: Submit enquiries and applications (in-
cluding CV, letter of motivation and names and con-
tact information of two references) before December 14
to Prof. Joachim Krug or Dr. Arjan de Visser. The
University of Cologne is one of the leading German in-
stitutions in Molecular and Evolutionary Genetics. Wa-

Project summary:
Breeding aggregations are ubiquitous in the animal
kingdom, yet experiments are lacking to explain the
mechanisms that cause animals to cluster their breeding
territories. Interest in animal aggregations is currently
undergoing a renaissance with a growing awareness that
multiple types of aggregations such as colonies, ﬁsh
shoals and foraging ﬂocks of birds may be formed by
common mechanisms. The emerging concept of public
information has the potential to serve as a common
thread unifying various types of aggregations. This
proposal follows up on an existing FWF project and
aims to perform novel experiments that address two
hypotheses explaining breeding aggregations: (1) the
classic, unresolved hypothesis that high density breed-
ing provides safety from predators and (2) the newer
hidden lek hypothesis that sexual selection contributes
to breeding aggregations. We examine the taxonomic
generality of mechanisms of aggregation by testing hy-
potheses on ﬁsh that have been primarily developed
from birds. We combine tightly controlled behavioral
experiments in aquariums with complementary ﬁeld ex-
periments in Lake Tanganyika, including DNA anal-
yses of parentage and other genetic parameters. We
have chosen two ﬁsh species whose breeding territories
are potentially aggregated by diﬀerent components of
mate choice, one of which is also a model species for
testing predation avoidance. In our current project we
have shown experimentally in three-spined sticklebacks-
Gasterosteus aculeatus that females prefer males with
territories near a more attractive male, supporting the
hidden lek hypothesis. We will build on this result by
determining whether males increase their mating suc-
cess by aggregating their breeding territories around
more attractive males. Our principal study species is
Neolamprologus caudopunctatus, a monogamous cich-
lid that breeds in dense colonies in which we propose
experiments testing two potential mechanisms of colony
formation: 1. Breeders choose to settle near neighbors
to increase their chances of pairing with a better matein the future, and 2. Breeders extract public infor-
mation from predator warnings that neighbors signal
to their oﬀspring. The study of these two contrasting
model systems will permit us to evaluate the general-
ity of mechanisms that form various kinds of breeding
aggregations.

UC Davis WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGE-
NETICS at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay,
California
March 6-13, 2010
Sponsored by the
University of California, Davis and Bodega Marine Lab-
oratory (additional ﬁnancial support provided by the
University of Rochester, and NESCent)
Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
playing an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecological communities. The estimation of
phylogenetic trees is now a well formalized statistical
problem, with general agreement on the central issues
and questions. A nearly standard set of topics is now
taught as part of the curriculum at many colleges and
universities. On the other hand, application of phylo-
genetic methods to novel problems outside systematics
is an area of special excitement, innovation, and con-
troversy, and perspectives vary widely.
In March, 2010, for the eleventh year, we will teach
a workshop for graduate students interested in apply-
ing phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in biology.
The one-week course will be an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied. We cover a range of topics in ecol-
ogy, phylogenomics, functional morphology, macroevo-
lution, speciation, and character evolution. The course
starts with recent advances in phylogenetic methodol-
ogy, and then focuses on methods and tools that can be
brought to bear on these “applied” issues in the context
of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held entirely at the Bodega Marine
Lab on the Northern California coast, which has ex-
tensive computing resources and on-site housing. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, discus-
sion, and training in software and internet tools. One
afternoon during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips
to local natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Estimating, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees * Recent advances in tree estimation: Bayesian in-
ference; stochastic optimization strategies; divide-and-
conquer methods; gene- tree species tree inference *
Estimation of divergence times from sequence data: re-
laxed clocks, calibration issues * Analysis of character
evolution-theory: maximum likelihood and Bayesian
approaches; ancestral-state estimation; character cor-relation; rates of trait evolution * Analysis of character
evolution-form and function of complex character sys-
tems * Inference of diversiﬁcation rates: detecting rate
shifts, testing key innovation hypotheses * Phylogenetic
perspectives on biodiversity and conservation biology *
Phyloinformatics: mining sequence databases for phy-
logenetic analysis * Ecological Phylogenetics: commu-
nity composition and historical assembly Instructors for
the main workshop.
* Peter Wainwright * Brian Moore * Michael Sanderson
* Bruce Rannala * Jonathan Eisen * Sharon Strauss
* John Huelsenbeck * Rich Glor * Justen Whittall *
Thomas Near * Jean Burns * Greg Pauly * Samantha
Price * Phil Spinks * Robert Thomson
plus guest lecturers!!
Prerequisites. Students should have some familiarity
with phylogenetic methods through previous course-
work. Some experience with PAUP, PHYLIP, or other
programs for phylogeny estimation will be assumed.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $550. This includes
room and board at BML for duration of the course (ar-
riving March 6, leaving March 13) and transportation
from Davis to BML.
Application Deadline. Applications are due by Jan-
uary 8, 2010. Please send a completed application
form (available at http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/-
Front Page ) and one letter of recommendation from
your major advisor. Applications should be sent via
email as PDFs to pqspinks@ucdavis.edu. Sorry, but
due to the limited size of the class, postdocs and fac-
ulty are discouraged from applying. Students will be
notiﬁed via e-mail by 22 January of acceptance.

Intl Master EvolutionaryBiol
Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Evolutionary Biology
(MEME)
MEME is a new two-year research oriented master pro-
gramme for talented and motivated students who areJanuary 1, 2010 EvolDir 93
interested in understanding evolution in all its facets.
The MEME programme will address the driving forces
of evolution at all levels of organismal organisation
(from cells and individuals to populations and ecosys-
tems), and it will allow students to study all kinds of or-
ganisms (microorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds
of habitats (marine as well as terrestrial) with a diver-
sity of approaches (ﬁeld, lab, theory). The focus of the
programme is not only on how evolution shaped life on
our planet in the past, but also on how understanding
the principles underlying evolution can provide new in-
sights and help to cope with present-day challenges in a
variety of ﬁelds, including ecology, epidemiology, phys-
iology, immunology, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics,
economics and the social sciences.
Only few universities in the world would be able to oﬀer
a programme of such broad scope without compromis-
ing scientiﬁc quality. For this reason, four European
universities: - University of Groningen (Netherlands) -
University of Montpellier II (France) - Ludwig Maximil-
ians University of Munich (Germany) - Uppsala Univer-
sity (Sweden) have joined forces with Harvard Univer-
sity (USA). Together, this consortium is able to put to-
gether an attractive multidisciplinary programme that
meets highest standards. All students have to study at
at least two partner universities, and they will receive
either a joint MSc degree from the whole consortium or
double degrees from two partner universities.
Being ﬁnanced by the European Community, MEME
has to satisfy the high quality standards imposed the
prestigious Erasmus Mundus Programme. Full schol-
arships are available for MEME students and will be
awarded in a selective procedure.
Starting date: September 2010
Application deadline: January 3, 2010 (non-European
students); April 15, 2010 (European students)

The Third Course on Individual-based Modelling of
Microbial Interactions & Processes Using iDynoMiCS
PhD Course June 20-25 2010 The University of Birm-
ingham, UK
We are once again delighted to oﬀer a hands-on course
in modelling of microbial systems. In one stimulating
week, this workshop will get you into individual-based
modelling of microbial interactions with our newly
developed software tool iDynoMiCS (individual-based
Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator). In
particular, you will get an in depth understanding of
mathematical modelling of bioﬁlms and other spatially
structured microbial systems.
The course is intended for all students and researchers
who have started to, or are considering to use,
individual-based modelling for microbial systems. By
the end of the course, participants will be able to in-
dependently use iDynoMiCS and apply it to their own
work. The course will consist of a mix of core and guest
lectures, tutorials, and a mini-project.
After running this course twice at the Danish Technical
University in Lyngby, Copenhagen, with great success,
the course will be held at the University of Birmingham
in the UK in 2010.
Candidates from the ﬁelds of environmental science, mi-
crobiology, ecology, computer science, applied math-
ematics, engineering, and physics are encouraged to
apply. Send (i) a brief statement of research interest
and level of experience in modelling/programming, (ii)
a brief CV, and (iii) a letter of support from your main
advisor. The limited number of places will be allocated
on a ﬁrst come ﬁrst served basis.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note thatJanuary 1, 2010 EvolDir 99
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
