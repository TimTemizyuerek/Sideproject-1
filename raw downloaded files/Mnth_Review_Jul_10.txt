BathU SexualSelection Sep1-4
Dear friends and colleagues
“New directions in sexual selection research: unifying
behavioural and genomic approaches” Bath University
September 1st to 4th 2010.
Conference website: http://www.ert-
conservation.co.uk/Conference home.htm (1) Ex-
tended call for abstracts:4 EvolDir July 1, 2010
We have had a large response to the ﬁrst call for papers.
Some people were unable to meet the deadline and have
requested an extension. To accommodate this demand,
the new submission deadline is Friday 25th June. So
far, in addition to our four keynotes, we have selected
26 speakers arranged in the following four sessions:
1: Sexual conﬂict and male-female coevolution. 2:
Post-copulatory sexual selection. (i) Seminal ﬂuid: evo-
lution and function
(ii) Sperm competition and evolution
3: Unifying behavioural and genomic approaches. (i)
Ecology, behaviour and genetics of mate choice
(ii) Male and female sex roles
4: Synthesis: next generation sequencing, transcrip-
tomics, proteomics and beyond.
We are seeking about ten new oral papers (no limit
on posters). Abstracts should be to be emailed to
Mark@ERT-conservation.co.uk Please see the attached
pdf for further submission details.
(2) Booking and registration deadline:
The deadline for registration at the conference is
Wednesday 21st July. To book your place, go to:
http://www.ert-conservation.co.uk/Registration.htm
There are 200 delegate places but only 150 accommo-
dation rooms available on the campus. These will be
designated on a ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-serve basis so please
book your place as early as possible.
We would be extremely grateful if you could forward
this message to colleagues who you think might be in-
terested in attending the conference, or place the at-
tached pdf on a departmental noticeboard.

Dear colleagues,
*Registration still open! **There are still 10 places to
attend the symposium with a poster presentation or as
a participant.*
We organize a conference on “Social systems: demo-
graphic and genetic issues” next October (11-15 ^th )
in Paimpont, Brittany, France. We propose the confer-July 1, 2010 EvolDir 5
ence to be organized around 2 major themes:
1. /Social organization and demographic structure/ –
The inﬂuence of philopatry, polygyny, dispersal bias
among sexes, natal sex ratio, social reproductive sup-
pression, kin selection and kin discrimination, on de-
mographic structure
2. /Social organization and genetic structure/ –The ef-
fects of social organization and group dynamics, the role
of group ﬁssion, ﬁssion-fusion social systems, sex biased
dispersal, the inﬂuence of dominance rank (lineages or
individuals), mate choice on the distribution of relat-
edness and gene diversity of neutral and functional (for
instance MHC) genes. The conference will mix theoret-
ical and empirical approaches, scientiﬁc questions with
methodological issues.
The conference will be limited to about 75 people.
There is no more place for oral communications.
We invite people who wish to present a poster or to
attend the conference to send us their abstract and/or
to register before June 30.

Coimbra Portugal SoilAdapation
Jun12-16
Serpentine soils present extreme edaphic conditions: el-
evated concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, Cr, Co), low
concentrations of essential nutrients, a low Ca/Mg ra-
tio and a low water capacity. Despite these unfavor-
able conditions, adaptive serpentine tolerance is both
geographically and phylogenetically widespread, which
renders these soils into systems particularly suited forstudying the process of adaptive evolution in nature.
We cordially invite you to attend the 7th International
Conference on Serpentine Ecology that will take place
in Coimbra, Portugal, from 12-16 June 2011. The
conference is organized by the Centre for Functional
Ecology ( http://ecology.uc.pt ) and hosted by the De-
partment of Life Sciences of the University of Coimbra
(http://www.uc.pt ).
The conference provides an opportunity for the gath-
ering of researchers from around the world, to share
and discuss their ﬁndings regarding the broad and
inter-disciplinary ﬁeld of serpentine ecology, includ-
ing the fascinating relationships that exist between ex-
treme geology and life, from organisms to communi-
ties and ecosystems. Participants in former conferences
included geologists, soil scientists, plant chemists and
biochemists, microbiologists, astrobiologists, botanists
and geobotanists, zoologists, ecologists, ecophysiolo-
gists, restoration ecologists, evolutionary geneticists
and conservation biologists.
To highlight the commitment of our scientiﬁc commu-
nity to the conservation of serpentine habitats world-
wide, the motto of the VII ICSE will be: “Promoting
awareness of serpentine biodiversity”.

London ASAB SexualSelection
Dec2-3
Subject heading: ASAB Winter Conference
Main text:
Interspeciﬁc Communication
Signalling and communication, in the context of sexual
selection, has been one of the dominant research areas
in animal behaviour for the last three decades. The
2010 Winter ASAB conference will instead focus on in-
terspeciﬁc communication. This topic is rich in terms of
extraordinary natural history and the theory needed to
understand what is going on, and has profound impli-
cations for evolution and ecology. Sub-themes include:
host manipulation by parasites (including brood par-
asites), plant-pollinator interactions, anti-predator de-
fensive signals, the evolution of mutualism, and alarm-
calling.
The plenary speakers at the main conference are:
Redouan Bshary (University of Neuchˆ atel, Switzerland)
Lars Chittka (Queen Mary College, University of Lon-
don, UK) Rebecca Kilner (University of Cambridge,
UK) Leena Lindstrom (University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Fin-
land) Rob Magrath (Australian National University,
Australia)
The meeting is, as always, also host to ASAB’s annual
Tinbergen lecture. This year’s speaker is Laurent Keller
of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
We are now seeking contributed talks and posters to
complement the exceptional invited speakers. Please
send abstracts of potential contributions, using the

This is a reminder that the Call for Challenge entries
for the inaugural conference on Informatics for Phylo-
genetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio) closes
in two weeks on June 21, 2010.
The theme of the 2010 iEvoBio conference challenge
is “New visualization methods for evolutionary data”.
Visualizing evolution is a key part of our discipline and
presents opportunities as much as it does obstacles.
The iEvoBio Challenge is deliberately wide ranging:
entries could range from geophylogenies to visualizing
extremely large phylogenetic trees, to mashups showing
relationships between lineages and other types of data
(e.g. conservation status).
Further information on the nature of challenge entries
and how to submit them can be found on the iEvoBio
website at http://ievobio.org/challenge.html . Selected
candidates will make short oral presentations to demon-
strate their visualization in a “Challenge session” at the
conference, and will automatically be entered into the
Software Bazaar if suitable.
The winners of the Challenge will be judged collectivelyby the iEvoBio participants. There will be cash prizes
for the ﬁrst place ($1,000) and runner up entries.
Challenge entries are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are:
1) Full talks (closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3) Soft-
ware Bazaar entries, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather gath-
erings. The Calls for Lightning Talks and Software
Bazaar entries remain open (see http://ievobio.org/-
ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/ ), and information on the
Birds-of-a-Feather session is forthcoming.
More details about the program and guidelines for con-
tributing content are available at http://ievobio.org .
Continuous updates can also be found on the con-
ference’s Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio .
iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolution-
ary Synthesis Center (NESCent) in partnership with
the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB). Additional
support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of Life
(EOL).

Jun29-30 BoFs
In anticipation of the inaugural conference on Infor-
matics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity
(iEvoBio), we solicit all attendees to propose and dis-
cuss Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. See below for de-
tails.
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings (BoFs) are informal, ad-
hoc, focused face-to-face discussion groups that form
around a shared interest. BoFs have a leader (usually,
but not necessarily, the proposer) who initiates or mod-
erates the discussion, but typically not a preset agenda.
The topics of BoFs can range widely, including general
cultural or computational infrastructure issues, or nar-
rower questions such as how to make the best use of
a particular software tool or how to solve a particular
computational challenge.
Anyone willing to lead such a group can propose a BoF.10 EvolDir July 1, 2010
iEvoBio will provide space that can accommodate up
to 8-10 BoFs. Sign-up sheets will be provided on-site
on the ﬁrst day of the conference where attendees can
propose a BoF or sign up for one proposed by someone
else. BoFs will be about 1 hr in duration and take place
in the afternoon of the second day of the conference.
In line with their informal nature, there is no oﬃcial
prior call for or submission of BoFs. However, we en-
courage those intending to propose one to sound out or
rally potential attendees ahead of time. We suggest to
employ Twitter ( http://twitter.com ) for this, using the
#ievobioBof tag to mark BoF proposals and comments.
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings are only 1 of 5 kinds
of contributed content that iEvoBio will feature.
The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2) Light-
ning talks (waiting list only), 3) Challenge entries,
and 4) Software Bazaar entries. The Calls for
Challenge entries ( http://ievobio.org/challenge.html )
and Software Bazaar entries ( http://ievobio.org/ocs/-
index.php/ievobio/2010/ ) remain open.
More details about the program and guidelines for con-
tributing content are available at http://ievobio.org .

ence’s Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio .

DeadlineExtended
Due to the great interest in this subject, we have de-
cided to extend the deadline for submitting manuscripts
to the Paciﬁc Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) spe-
cial session on “Microbiome Studies” to 18 July.
Please feel free to forward this email to anyone whom
you think would be interested. Attached please ﬁnd an
updated poster.Abstract of special session: Microbes dominate life on
earth, measured by biomass, habitat diversity, phylo-
genetic diversity, or metabolic potential. Nonetheless,
microbiome studies are in their infancy. Most natu-
ral ecosystems remain uncharacterized. Many human
microbiome sites are unexplored, with very few com-
parisons of healthy versus diseased individuals. Mecha-
nisms for microbial adaption and ecological engineering
are poorly understood. Supporting computational tools
are just emerging. This session addresses these needs.

EvolutionaryComputation
Three open positions for 2 PhD students and 1 post-
doc in the area of evolutionary computation / bio-
inspired computing Interdisciplinary research project
“Bio-inspired computing for coordination and control
in large-scale and dynamic systems (BioCo3)”
In this interdisciplinary project (involving computer
science, biology, operations research and logistics ex-
pertise) we will study decentralized approaches for con-
trolling large-scale, dynamic systems - e.g. for control-
ling a large number of vehicles that need to accomplish
transport tasks for clients (package delivery service).
Achieving eﬃcient and eﬀective collective behavior is
known to be quite a challenge, esp. if the systems are
large in scale and submitted to changing operating con-
ditions. Complex collective behaviour occurs in many
socio-biological systems. Social insects, e.g., are able
to ﬁnd the shortest path to food sources without any
central control, or can build enormously complex nests
with built-in ventilation systems, or divide the work
such that the chances of survival are optimal.
Some socio-biological mechanisms for collective behav-
ior have already been studied in the context of com-
puting (e.g. stigmergy and digital pheromones, or in
discrete optimization techniques, such as ant colony
optimization, artiﬁcial immune systems, genetic algo-
rithms). It becomes apparent, however, that (1) large-
scale and dynamic systems still hold major challenges,
and (2) many socio-biological concepts and techniques
have been unexplored.
The project therefore aims to study advanced concepts
and mechanisms, known from social biological systems,
and their applicability in decentralized control systems.
To guide the research, the project will use concrete ap-
plication scenarios, based on decentralized control in
pickup-and-delivery problems (PDPs), and evolution-
ary algorithms to evolve more eﬃcient control strate-
gies.
Keywords: Multi-agent systems, Discrete optimiza-
tion, Sociobiology, Social Insects, Biologically-inspired

Optimisation, Evolutionary Algorithms, Genetic Algo-

A PhD position available, Evolutionary genetics of the
invasive Northern Paciﬁc Sea Star, Asterias amurensis,
in Australia
Supervisors: Dr Craig Sherman (PI), Dr Ben Hayes
(Department of Primary Industries) Institution: The
Centre for Integrative Ecology, Deakin University, Aus-
tralia
Aims and background: Invasive species are now recog-
nised as one of the most serious threats to Australias
biodiversity. While substantial work has been carried
out on the ecology of invasive species, the evolutionary
genetics of invasive species has received less attention.
However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the
establishment and spread of exotic species can be in-
ﬂuenced by their adaptive potential and that eﬀective
control requires an understanding of the evolvability of
invasive species.
The invasive North Paciﬁc Sea Star is a ferocious ma-
rine predator and has the potential to have a devas-
tating eﬀect on Australias aquaculture industry and
signiﬁcantly reduce the biodiversity of marine com-
munities. It is estimated that there are more than
90 million in Port Phillip Bay, with the potential for
this species to occupy even larger areas from Syd-
ney to Perth. In spite of being listed as one of the
ten highest marine risk pests in Australia, virtually
nothing is known about its potential for local adap-
tation and what may constrain its progression along
the east and southwest coasts of the continent. This
project will provide crucial information on the evolu-
tionary biology of this species and identify key life his-
tory traits important for the successful management of
this invasive species. More information can be found
at: http://www.deakin.edu.au/scitech/les/research/-
rpa/ecophysiology/opportunities/seastar.php The ap-
plicant must hold a ﬁrst class honours or masters de-
gree (or equivalent) in biology. The candidate should
have a strong interest in evolutionary and molecular ge-
netics/genomics, local adaptation, quantitative genet-
ics and experimental molecular work.
How to apply
Expressions of interest with a covering letter, CV, and
names and contact details of two referees should be sent
to Dr. Sherman (craig.sherman@deakin.edu.au).14 EvolDir July 1, 2010
Interested candidates should lodge a Research Schol-
arship application with Deakin University ( http:/-
/www.deakin.edu.au/research/admin/scholarships/-
index.php ). There are three rounds of applications:
The ﬁrst minor round is open to international and

NewZealand Biogeoinformatics
A PhD position is available in New Zealand on “Bio-
diveristy science: biogeoinformatics” supervised by
Alexei Drummond and Thomas Buckley.
Biodiveristy science: biogeoinformatics
The evolutionary and ecological relationships between
the landscape and all its inhabitants represent a story
that unfolds over both vast and short time scales. Un-
derstanding that story, its natural rhythms and its re-
sponses to perturbation, is the prime concern of molecu-
lar ecologists and evolutionary biologists the world over.
A number of related ﬁelds and analysis techniques have
developed in this area: historical biogeography, phylo-
geography, landscape genetics and niche modeling, to
name a few.
The foundation of this project is the development of
an enabling scientiﬁc resource for a new type of biodi-
versity science: biogeoinformatics. The research aims
to enable a transition in the focus of molecular ecol-
ogy from groups of closely-related species in isolation
to spatially explicit genetic samples from species as-
semblages, communities and ecosystems. When an in-
dividual species or closely-related group of species is
of primary interest, biogeoinformatics aims to put that
species in the context of its wider ecosystem and habi-
tat.
This project involves the design, development, cura-
tion and analysis of a national (NZ) repository of
geo-located biodiversity data. The software devel-
oped will allow the upload, public access and visu-
alization of phylogeographical data. The research
data will consist of geo-located, time-stamped genetic
and genomic samples from New Zealand fauna and
ﬂora. Natural overlays include geological, ecological
and species distribution data, niche models et cetera.
The main scientiﬁc outputs will be (i) a series of
combined analyses of all existing NZ phylogeographic
data sets to address open questions about NZ bio-
geography and the origins and history of NZ biota
and (ii) the development of a scientiﬁc toolkit for16 EvolDir July 1, 2010
biogeoinformatic research. The successful candidate
will be a biology-oriented computer science student,
or an ecologist/evolutionary biologist with strong com-
puter programming skills. The PhD would be based
in the University of Auckland under the supervision
of A/Prof Alexei Drummond (University of Auckland,
alexei@cs.auckland.ac.nz) and Dr Thomas Buckley
(Landcare Research, buckleyt@landcareresearch.co.nz).
We anticipate that the successful candidate developing
good links with other research groups in NZ that focus
on phylogeographical questions.

START OF PhD STUDENTSHIP ADVERT
PhD studentship: studying natural selection and evolu-tionary processes in the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus
salmonis
The Institute of Marine Research (IMR) has a three-
year PhD studentship available in the Population Ge-
netics and Ecology research group in Bergen to work
on experimental studies of natural selection, evolution
and genetics in the parasitic copepod, L. salmonis.
The position will be linked to a work-package within
the Norwegian Research Council funded project “Pre-
venT” which is a large inter-institute project studying
molecular, epidemiology and evolutionary processes in
L. salmonis.
The IMR has a long history of conducting experiments
with L. salmonis, and supports a well equipped lab-
oratory in Bergen that includes a rearing facility for
conducting experiments on this parasite. Technological
advances have provided us with the ability to produce
strains of lice (inbred, outbred, drug-resistant and mu-
tant), and family groups. When combined with DNA
parentage testing, this system provides the ability to
study and manipulate how genotype (individual, fam-
ily or strain) and environment (temperature, salinity,
chemicals, host type) interact for this parasite.
The studentship will be based upon planning and ex-
ecution of biological experiments in the facility above.
Lice family groups will be established by the student
and challenged by environmental variables in order to
study and quantify selection. These experiments will
require meticulous planning and attention to detail. In-
dividual lice surviving the experiments will be identi-
ﬁed by parentage testing using microsatellites. Thus,
the position will include a mixture of experimental, and
some DNA laboratory work.
We wish to appoint a highly motivated person with a
masters degree in a biological discipline. The ideal can-
didate will be able to document ﬁrst-hand experience
of designing, planning and executing biological experi-
ments, preferably with sea lice, and has experience of
basic molecular techniques such as DNA isolations and
PCR. However, candidates showing relevant experience
with other experimental systems will be considered.
The Institute emphasizes personal qualities such as
good communication and cooperative skills, the ability
to work independently and as part of an active research
team.
We oﬀer:
* a positive, challenging and creative work environment
* the opportunity to work in a national institute with
a high level of international contact * ﬂexible hours, a
good pension scheme and a wide range of welfare ser-
vices.July 1, 2010 EvolDir 17

Optimization of captive breeding systems for salmonid
stock enhancement using molecular tags Fully-funded
KESS PhD Scholarship 2010/2011 entry
Closing date: 23 July 2010
Supervisors: Dr Carlos Garcia de Leaniz (Swansea Uni-
versity, Pure & Applied Ecology) Dr Soﬁa Consuegra
(Aberystwyth University, IBERS) Dr John Taylor and
Dr Peter Gough (Environment Agency Wales)
Project Description: Aquatic ecosystems provide key
resources for humans but tend to be less resilient than
terrestrial environments, being home to endangered
organisms that are often easily damaged by anthro-
pogenic activities. Developments such as tidal barrages
can have catastrophic consequences for aquatic fauna
(particularly for migratory species) and demonstrate
the need for knowledge on a range of aquatic issues.
Molecular tags are increasingly being used to assign ﬁsh
to their population of origin, to determine paternity and
establish pedigrees, and to distinguish hatchery from
wild ﬁsh. In salmonid restoration programs, the use
of molecular tags for mark-and-recapture will dispense
with the need to physically tag hatchery ﬁsh and will
allow for identiﬁcation of stocked juveniles and return-
ing adults. This will result in considerable savings and
improved management of endangered salmonid stocks,
and will also permit the estimation of ﬁtness parame-
ters of relevance for conservation
The objectives of this research project are: 1. To assess
the contribution of stocked (hatchery-reared) and wild
Atlantic salmon using inherent, non-intrusive molecu-
lar tags to the River Taﬀ; 2. To estimate the genetic
diversity and eﬀective populations sizes of the wild and
stocked salmon populations; 3. To assess the eﬀects of
multiple paternity and breeding design on survival and
ﬁtness of juvenile salmon; 4. To develop guidelines for
improved breeding designs in salmonid stock enhance-
ment.
The project is part-funded by the European Social Fund
(ESF) through the European Union’s Convergence pro-
gramme administered by the Welsh Assembly Govern-
ment. KESS PhD scholarships are collaborative awards
with external partners. The successful candidate will
work with academic staﬀ at Swansea and AberystwythUniversities, in collaboration with an industry partner,
the Environment Agency Wales, based in Llandarcy.
Applicant requirements: We are looking for a highly
motivated student with a First or Upper Second Class
Honours degree in Biological Sciences or related ﬁeld.
Knowledge of ﬁsh biology, molecular ecology, and con-
servation biology is desirable. Acquaintance with
salmonid conservation, evolutionary ecology and popu-
lation genetics will also be an advantage.
Scholarship value: The scholarship covers University
tuition fees (3440 in 2010/2011) for three years and a
stipend of 13,290 per annum for three years. Generous
support for consumables, equipment and travel is also
available.
Training: The achievement of a Higher-level Skills De-
velopment Award (HSDA) is compulsory for each KESS
scholar. The HSDA is based on a 60 credit award, which
is an additional award to the PhD.
Eligibility: - Applicants must be UK/EU citizens. - Ap-
plicants must reside in the Convergence Area of Wales
at the time of enrolment, and must also be able to take
paid employment in the Convergence Area on comple-
tion of the scholarship. The Convergence Area means

How organisms adapt to environmental changes? Ge-
nomics has revealed the complexity of gene networks
underpinning cellular processes. So far we know little
on how ecological adaptation aﬀects genomes, because
of the diﬃculty of simultaneously studying evolution
at both ecological and whole genome levels. If natural
selection is indeed a key mechanism at the interplay
between genes and environment, the targeted genetic
factors remain to be uncovered. Baculoviruses open a
new perspective to understand at the genomic level how
organisms adapt to their environment. Viruses have
to evolve in well-deﬁned and constrained niches: the
hosts they infect. Moreover, their 150kb genomes are
readily accessible by high throughput sequencing tech-
nology. The transmission of baculoviruses as groups of
genomes sets them further apart for studying the eﬀect
of niches on populations. Their molecular biology is
also well understood, a key to investigating the genetic
and functional details of adaptation. They are ideal for
linking genome changes to ecological changes.
At the frontier of ecology and genomics the project
takes on the challenge of studying ecological adaptation
at the level of whole genomes. Combining experimental
evolution with comparative genomics, the speciﬁc goal
is to characterise the phenotypic and genotypic adapta-
tion of a baculovirus population to diverse host species.
We seek a candidate with strong interests in evo-
lutionary biology, experimental evolution and bioin-

elegans and related species across diﬀerent locations in
Germany. This nematode is one of the best studied or-
ganisms under laboratory conditions; yet we still lack
understanding of the conditions under which it lives innature, including its microbial associates. Such infor-
mation is essential for full understanding of the biol-
ogy of this organism, including the exact function of

The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. This speciﬁc
PhD position (payment through the DFG according
to 13 TV-L/2) will be based in the recently founded
Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics at
the University of Kiel (Northern Germany), headed by
Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schulenburg. The department itself
provides an international and interactive atmosphere,
while Kiel University and connected institutes (e.g.,

ULaval Molecular basis of behaviour
variation
Our laboratory is eager to receive application from
highly motivated scientists with an excellent record to
apply to a Quebec government fellowship available for
non-Canadian candidates to study in a Quebec- based
laboratory. Doctoral fellowships are available. Further-
more, internships are available for a visit to our labora-
tory (3000$can/ month, up to 4 months) during gradu-
ate studies in another laboratory. Pre-selection by the
host university and our laboratory is mandatory.
Candidates from all over the world are invited to ap-
ply. Additionally, speciﬁc fellowships are available for
candidates from Mexico, Brazil, China and Wallonie.
We are in the Department of Biology at Laval Univer-
sity, located in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Our lab-
oratory is part of the Institute of Integrative and Sys-
tems Biology (IBIS). We study the underlying molec-
ular and hormonal causes of variation in behaviour in
vertebrates. We are interested in personality with an
emphasis on the stress response and correlation among
behaviours, as well as in reproductive tactics. We are
also interested by the eﬀects of the environment on de-
velopment of behaviour, such as environmental enrich-
ment in captive animals, maternal/paternal and social
group eﬀects, and endocrine disrupters. We therefore
have a strong interest for phenotypic plasticity, along
with the eﬀects of genetic variation. We favour an in-
tegrative approach by linking data from the same in-
dividual: neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and their
receptors (quantitative Real-Time PCR, microarrays,
in situ hybridization, HPLC), hormones (EIA, HPLC),
physiology and behaviour. Our model system is the
threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, a small
ﬁsh studied in behavioural biology, which can be kept
easily in the lab and whose genome is sequenced.
Laval University is one of the ten main Canadian uni-
versities. Quebec City is dynamic with all the advan-
tages of a large city while still allowing for very easy
access to wilderness and very reasonable cost of living.
The chosen candidates that are successful at obtaining
a fellowship will be part of the Institute of Integrative
and Systems Biology. They will have access to core
genomics and molecular biology facilities, lab meetings
and Institute-wide group meetings, journal clubs and
weekly seminars at the Institute and in the BiologyDepartment. Several ecological genomics laboratories
are part of the Institute and the Biology department,
allowing for enriched interactions with members of the
other laboratories working in this ﬁeld. DEADLINES:
Our laboratory must receive applications before July
23, 2010. We will then proceed to select candidates
that will be able to apply to the University pre-selection
committee with a deadline of August 9th 2010. Can-
didates selected by the university will then be allowed
to apply to the general competition in Fall 2010, with
results given in April 2011. Start date can be between
May and December 2011.

SaltmarshGeneticBiodiversity
Does the recovery of genetic diversity within species
parallel the recovery of species diversity in restored salt-
marsh systems?
Saltmarshes are highly important for biodiversity, sup-
porting a high density of invertebrates, and large num-
bers of wading birds and wildfowl. In addition to their
biodiversity value, saltmarshes provide essential ecosys-
tem services to human communities, such as ﬂood de-
fence and control of estuarine nutrient pollution. How-
ever, a combination of anthropogenic pressures has re-
sulted in ongoing loss and degradation of saltmarsh in
the UK. Saltmarshes are now a priority habitat under
the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, under which restora-
tion and creation of new saltmarsh is a key objective.
Saltmarsh plant biodiversity is key to ecosystem func-
tion. In these low plant diversity communities, diver-
sity within species (genetic diversity) may compensate
for low species diversity, resisting disturbance and in-
vasion and maintaining high diversity of the saltmarsh
fauna. This project will assess the temporal develop-
ment of biodiversity in restored saltmarsh, focussing on
the recovery of genetic diversity in key plant species and
invertebrate and bird species recovery. The work will
include a theoretical focus on community development
as well as having application to saltmarsh restoration
practice. The project will include a substantial com-
ponent of population genetic analysis of samples to be
collected during ﬁeldwork throughout the UK, together
with additional analyses of existing biodiversity data.
The successful candidate will work with Alistair Jump
at the University of Stirling in association with Toby
Wilson of RSPB Scotland. The ideal candidate will
have a strong interest in restoration ecology. He or she
should have broad ecological knowledge and be inde-
pendent and highly self-motivated. Experience of con-
ducting ecological sampling and survey work is essential
and a high degree of competence in laboratory-based
(particularly population genetic) analyses will be an
advantage. The successful applicant will be required
to liaise with reserve managers and relevant NGO staﬀ
and to work with minimum supervision whilst under-

PHD STUDENT POSITION - TROPICAL BIODI-
VERSITY
One three-year PhD student position (2011-13) is avail-
able in the newly funded project “Biodiversity and
multiple trophic interactions” lead by PhD Ilari E.
S¨ a¨ aksj¨ arvi (Zoological Museum, Department of Biol-
ogy, University of Turku) and PhD Juha-Pekka Salmi-
nen (Department of Chemistry, University of Turku).
The project is funded by the Kone Foundation, Fin-
land.
The project aims to study biodiversity of selected
key faunal elements and trophic interactions in Peru-
vian Amazonia (The National Reserve of Allpahuayo-
Mishana). The team has studied the parasitoid in-
sect diversity (taxonomy, systematics and ecology) of
Allpahuayo-Mishana since 1998. The new project will
assess biodiversity patterns of Amazonian insects using
a novel combination of study methodologies (includ-
ing biodiversity research; natural compound chemistry;
DNA barcoding, rearing lepidopteran larvae and insectJuly 1, 2010 EvolDir 23
parasitoids). In summary, we aim to link tropical biodi-
versity to tritrophic tropical plant-herbivore-parasitoid
interactions in an environment whose present-day en-
vironmental conditions are governed by the Andean-
Amazonian landscape history.
The work description involves both extensive ﬁeldwork
in Peruvian Amazonia and laboratory works taking
place at the University of Turku. Salary euro 1,900
per month (non-negotiable) will be paid as a tax free
stipend up to euro 18,300 per year, with euro 4,500
per year subject to taxes. Successful applicants should
have a M.Sc. in biological sciences with expertise in
biodiversity research, tropical biology and/or entomol-
ogy. Experience of tropical ﬁeldwork and sampling of
natural insect populations is essential. Besides of En-
glish, a successful applicant should also speak Spanish.
The graduate student will coordinate part of the ﬁeld
work alone with local ﬁeld assistants who do not speak
English.
The applications should be sent to Ilari E. S¨ a¨ aksj¨ arvi
(ilari.saaksjarvi@utu.ﬁ or by mail to the address be-
low). We kindly ask you to attach a Curriculum vitae
to your application (with possible publication list in-
cluded), contact information of two references and a
max. one-paged letter of motivation. In the motivation
letter you should provide a description of your research
interests, language skills and state why you would be a
suitable candidate for the present project.
The work is scheduled to start in Turku, Finland, in
January, 2011. The ﬁeld work in Peru will be initiated
in April, 2011. The new PhD student will be posi-
tioned to work in the Zoological Museum, Section of
Biodiversity and Environmental Research, Department
of Biology, University of Turku.
Closing date for applications is 30th July, 2010. We
look forward to welcoming a new enthusiastic student
to our young and positive minded research team!

Position description: Applications are open for one 3-yr
Ph.D. assistantship (or a part-time post-doctoral assis-
tantship) to study the origin and evolution of island
endemics in the Mediterranean Region. Our ﬁrst stud-
ies on Rutaceae, Araceae and Boraginaceae used chloro-
plast DNA sequences and geological data to reconstruct
the temporal and spatial frameworks for the origin of
plants endemic to the continental fragment islands of
Corsica and Sardinia and the oceanic islands of the Ca-
narian archipelago (Salvo, G., S. Ho, G. Rosenbaum,

open questions include the following: i) Are species in
the selected Mediterranean groups monophyletic? ii)
What are the origins of the polyploid species? iii) Is
there variation of ploidy level within species? iv) Was
island colonization associated with a shift of the eco-
logical niche? The successful applicant will choose one
or more of these plant families to: generate ﬂow cytom-
etry data aimed at determining ploidy levels; generate
nuclear DNA sequences and infer species trees; incor-
porate ecological data to investigate issues of niche con-
servatism vs. niche evolution in the selected groups.
Requirements: Demonstrated experience in molecular,
phylogenetic and ﬂow-cytometry methods and/or eco-
logical niche modeling will be highly valued in the se-
lection process. Excellent knowledge of the English lan-24 EvolDir July 1, 2010

Cichlid evolution
Cichlid Evolution: Lessons in Diversiﬁcation Call for
Papers
With an estimated 3000 species, distributed from Cen-
tral and South America, across Africa to Madagascar,
the Middle East, and southern India, cichlid ﬁshes (Ci-
chlidae) represent the most species-rich family of ver-
tebrates, accounting for about 10% of extant teleost
diversity. Throughout their distributional range, ci-
chlids have repeatedly demonstrated their capacity for
undergoing adaptive radiation, generating an outstand-38 EvolDir July 1, 2010
ing variation of body shapes, colour patterns, and be-
haviour, and an enormous diversity of trophic and
ecological specializations, making them an important
model system for evolutionary biology. With the com-
pletion of the ﬁrst cichlid genomes in the foreseeable
future, cichlid ﬁshes will receive even more attention in
evolutionary research. We invite investigators to con-
tribute original research as well as tutorial or review
articles that seek to advance our knowledge of mech-
anisms underlying processes generating and maintain-
ing the tremendous diversity of cichlid ﬁshes. Potential
topics include, but are not limited to:
* Advances in phylogenetics, phylogeography, and pop-
ulation genetics * Genomic and transcriptomic research
* Role of behavioral and ecological specializations
in cichlid diversiﬁcation * Physiological/morphological
adaptations to particular environments * Importance of
hybridization for generating diversity * Sexual versus
natural selection * Evolution of developmental mecha-
nisms

Clustering PhylogeneticTree
Dear all,
I have a phylogenetic tree of 695 phoB proteins, now I
want to estimate the the optimal number of clusters on
this tree. However, before choosing any statistic to es-
timate the number of clusters I have to slide a vertical
line along the phylogenetic tree in order the decide the
current number of clusters. If this could be done auto-
matically, it means we have to handle the newick string
of this tree. How should I write the code dealing with
the newick string, which amounts to slide a vertical line
to decide the subgroups. Thanks in advance!
Sincerely,

Divergence rate To Mutation rate
conversion
I would like to calculate a mutation rate per site, per
generation, from a mtDNA control region divergence
rate reported in the literature in units of divergence per
million years. In my calculation, I am assuming that
each species diverges at an equal rate, and I have a gen-
eration time of 5 years. The reported divergence rate
is 4.8% per million years. To get the mutation rate, I
divide 0.048/1,000,000, multiply by 5 for my generation
time and divide by 2 to account for the fact that I have
two lineages going diﬀerent directions. This gives me
a lineage-speciﬁc mutation rate of 1.2 x 10(-7) per-site,
per-generation.
That seems like an awfully slow rate for the control re-
gion. Where am I going wrong? I feel like my math is
oﬀ somehow but I can’t ﬁgure out where.

Invasive species survey
Dear Colleagues, I would like to draw your attention
to the world’s largest collaborative project on invasive
species. The Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey is
just entering its second ﬁeld season and we already have
demographic data and seed collections from 65 popu-
lations – more than any published study on invasive
species. This year we are hoping to double that num-
ber and we are particularly keen to have more North
American contributors.
The project is an international collaboration aimed at
obtaining much-needed data on the abundance and dis-
tribution of /Alliaria petiolata/ (Garlic Mustard). It
involves a very basic sampling protocol that standard-
izes sampling across sites, making it ideal for incorpo-
ration into ﬁeld courses, nature surveys, and long-term
monitoring and management eﬀorts. The estimated du-
ration of sampling for a team of two people is 2-4 hours
per population.
For academics who substantially contribute to this
endeavor, we anticipate the possibility of authorship
on manuscripts resulting from the work. Our plan
for the future includes development of teaching mod-
ules and expanding to similar surveys for other key
invasive species. The sampling protocol and addi-
tional information are available at the following web-
site: www.GarlicMustard.org . Please contact us di-
rectly if would like to participate or if you have any
questions or concerns.Dr. Robert Colautti Biology Department Duke Univer-

London SpeakersCorner June14
Dear Evoldir user,
We’d like to invite you to attend/contribute to an ex-
citing, innovative science communication event taking
place in London this month.
On 14th June, distinguished scientists will commandeer
Speaker’s Corner in Hyde Park to address the public on
burning scientiﬁc issues such as evolution, biodiversity
and climate change. We are providing the public with
the opportunity to engage ﬁrst-hand with some of the
UK’s most eminent scientists. In eﬀect, we’re remov-
ing the -middle man’. The event will consist of three
themes: Evolution of the Earth (e.g., biodiversity, evo-
lution, palaeontology, geology), Earth Challenges (e.g.,
climate change, population growth, biodiversity loss),
Earth Solutions (e.g., sustainable energy, GM crops,
biodiversity conservation). Speakers include Armand
Leroi (of ’Mutants’), Robin Dunbar (Univ. Liverpool),
Sandy Knapp (NHM), Alun Anderson (science writer
and former editor-in-chief of New Scientist), Jonathan
Baillie (ZSL)...and many more!
See speaker biogs, and post your own questions at:
www.zsl.org/speakerscorner The event aims to comple-
ment the 2010 theme of International Year of Biodiver-
sity. We are turning Speaker’s Corner into an arena
for public (and scientiﬁc) learning and debate centred
around the theme of Biodiversity 2010. We feel this
is important and timely, given recent public distrust
of scientists and evident gaps in the public’s knowl-
edge and understanding of the key scientiﬁc issues fac-
ing the world today. Speaker’s Corner is internation-
ally renowned as a public arena for free speech, and
is therefore a very natural setting to encourage public
engagement in science.
Come and join in the heckling, discussions and fun!

Species for Macroevolution

The meeting is open to visitors. Wine will be served af-
ter the lecture to members and guests. Please advertise

Abstract: Species are fundamental units for evolution-
ary biology. Alone among the levels of classiﬁcations
into which we place individuals, the species level has the
potential to have an objective reality: when we count
them, we think we are counting something meaningful.
If we compare number of species in diﬀerent taxa, re-
gions, or times, we are led to try to understand why the
numbers are diﬀerent or similar. Incomplete knowledge
may lead us to use higher taxa, such as genera or fami-
lies, instead, but we do so in the hope and expectation
that they will reﬂect what good species-level data would
show. I will argue: 1. That this hope is misplaced -
analysing higher taxa conﬂates processes that should be
kept separate; 2. That analysing temporal patterns in
numbers of higher taxa might be particularly problem-
atic when using large, multi-author databases; 3. That
even species cannot be used uncritically in macroevo-
lutionary analyses - even with good data (a complete
phylogeny of present-day species, or a complete record
of fossil species) - but that 4. The best fossil records can
let us come close to the ideal species for macroevolution,
letting us tackle questions that cannot be addressed anyother way.

Mediterranean Flora
Origin of the Flora in the Mediterranean Basin: A
Window on Plant Evolution in Mediterranean Climate
Zones
Call for Papers
To date, many published biogeographic studies focused
on the spatial and temporal origin of particular ﬂoristic
regions, including the Holarctic, the Neotropics, South-
Africa, Macaronesia, or Hawaii, but only a few were
devoted to the Mediterranean Basin (MB). Indeed, the
relative contribution of geological processes and long-
distance dispersal (LDD) to the contemporary compo-
sition of this plant diversity hotspot remains largely un-
known. Main hypotheses on the geographic sources of
the MB ﬂora were mainly derived from qualitative as-
sessments of similarities with adjacent ﬂoristic regions
such as North Africa or the Middle-East, but not with
other Mediterranean ﬂoras. Indeed, despite the great
general resemblance between the ﬁve existing Mediter-
ranean areas worldwide, only a few works have system-
atically investigated the Mediterranean disjunctions us-
ing integrative approaches. Overall, questions dealing
with the origin, evolution, and aﬃnities of the respec-
tive Mediterranean ﬂoras remain largely unanswered for
example, (i) is the MB a cradle for other Mediterranean
regions? (ii) do these regions appear almost simultane-
ously under some general abiotic constraints or do they
have their own history?
In this issue, papers testing the congruence between es-
timated ages and geographic sources of some Mediter-
ranean groups with independently derived paleogeolog-
ical/climatic models are highly welcome. We particu-
larly take interest in manuscripts that report relevance
of (i) disjunct patterns within the MB or between the
MB and other Mediterranean regions, (ii) ﬂoristic ex-
changes between the Mediterranean areas via disper-
sal routes or long distance dispersal (LDD), and (iii)
abiotic/biotic events as drivers of speciation in these
diversity hotspots.July 1, 2010 EvolDir 41
Main topics include, but are not limited to: - Impor-
tance of vicariance, geodispersal, or LDD in the origin
of Mediterranean ﬂoras - Role of key innovations/key
opportunities in explaining the current high plant diver-
sity in the MB - Testing correlates of diversiﬁcation in
the MB ﬂora - Testing the existence of a Mediterranean
niche conservatism - Testing biogeographic methods al-
lowing an a priori implementation of probabilistic mod-

MrBayes aarevmatpr parameters
Dear EvolDir members, my name is Federico and I
am a PhD student currently working on mitochondrial
genome phylogenetics. Among other analyses, I wanted
to enforce MtArt and MtPan matrices for my protein
alignments: therefore, I used the MrBayes 3.1.2 com-
mand
prset aamodelpr=ﬁxed(gtr) aarevmatpr=ﬁxed( <190
comma-separated values >);
However, when the MCMC run is over and I proceed
with sump command, I see amino acid substitution
rates as free parameters in the STAT ﬁle. This was ob-
viously not expected, because they should be ﬁxed pa-
rameters and not allowed to vary, thanks to aarevmatpr
set to ﬁxed. In the similar case of nucleotide analyses,
indeed, substitution rates are not listed into the STAT
ﬁle if I use the prset revmatpr=ﬁxed command.
Through the showmodel command, I could see that Mr-
Bayes acknowledges that I set up a ﬁxing prior on sub-
stitution rates, but then lists them among free param-
eters and considers amino acids frequencies (!) as not
allowed to vary.
Did anyone come across the same problem? Can some-
one explain this behaviour of MrBayes 3.1.2? I am very
grateful in advance to each of you for the help to come!

MrBayes taxon names
Hello,
I have run a large single-gene mtDNA matrix, with
more than one sequence per species, in Mr Bayes. The
matrix was built using data downloaded from GenBank
and to identify the terminals I used shortened speciesnames followed by the accession numbers. When the
run had converged I used the sum t command to ob-
tain the consensus tree, however for several species the
name is cut short and most of the accession number is
no longer included but rather replaced by suspension
points (ie ...). Thus I can no longer identify speciﬁc se-
quences because the accession numbers have been cut
short. Strangely, the names are complete in the two
tree ﬁles, and they appear to be cut short only when
the sum t command is executed.
Is there a command that would allow me to tell Mr-
Bayes not to cut taxon names? The names I have are
not longer than those that appear in the example ﬁles
of MrBayes, nor do I have other symbols other than
alphanumeric and the underscore to replace a space.
Any suggestions are welcome!
Thank you,
Alejandro

NationalScienceFoundation forum
Dear Colleagues,
We are now in the season when most of us who applied
for NSF funding in January of 2010 are receiving word
that our grants will not be funded. In spite of many
weeks of grant writing and many years of ﬁeld and lab
research, as many as 75% of applicants are opening
emails that characterize our work as “Not Competi-
tive.”
And yet this is the same work that we routinely publish
in peer-reviewed journals and books, that got us jobs
at top-ﬂight institutions and positions on respected ed-
itorial boards and advisory panels, and that we present
and discuss passionately at professional meetings.July 1, 2010 EvolDir 43
Something is wrong with a system that does not rec-
ognize quality science, that is discouraging to new and
experienced researchers alike, and that oﬀers no appeals
process and little transparency.
In order to address these issues, several of us have cre-
ated a new discussion forum dedicated to debating the
current state of NSF and proposing solutions for its
challenges. We invite you to contribute to this critical
discussion.
*This forum is located at http://-
nsﬁsbroken.proboards.com/index.cgi* What problems
have you had with NSF? What creative solutions have
you come up with to these problems? The forum is
designed to address such issues. Let’s bring out our
best ideas, and hope that NSF pays attention.

NCBI to Wikipedia taxon mapping
Some 52,956 taxa that have sequences in GenBank are
linked to Wikipedia. These links appear in the NCBI
taxonomy pages under the heading “External Informa-
tion Resources (NCBI LinkOut)”. For example, the
NCBI page for “Mammuthus primigenius”
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/-
wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id7349 shows a link to
Wikipedia page for “Woolly Mammoth”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid369680
My motivation in creating this link was to provide an
easy way for someone visiting a NCBI taxonomy page
to get a quick sense of what we know about that taxon(even if it’s simply to answer “what on Earth is this?”).
For some details on how this mapping was created
please see my blog post: http://tinyurl.com/35cljpv .
Thanks to Scott Federhen and Kathy Kwan at NCBI
for all their assistance in getting this into NCBI Link-
out. There are inevitably going to be errors and om-
missions in this mapping. These can be updated at

funding
Sent on behalf of Michael Callahan, M.D., DTM&H,
Program Manager for Prophecy: Predicting Pathogen
Evolution.
Dear Members,
I am contacting you in regard to a novel funding op-
portunity which may be of interest to subscribers of the
EVOLDIR emailing list.
DARPA’s viral pathogen surveillance program known
as “Prophecy” is based on a multi-year investment in
the preemptive prediction of emerging viruses using in-
silica models validated by high-throughput biological
validation systems, all of which are corrected by the
real-time reporting of mutations in animal reservoirs
or humans. A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
will soon be released for Prophecy which will seek in-
tegrated multi-disciplinary solutions to predicting viral
pathogens before emergence in natural ecologies.
Talented scientists and engineers will be critical to the
success of this program. It is our belief that the mem-
bers of the EVOLDIR emailing list may oﬀer novel ap-
proaches, methodologies and trans-discipline solutions
which would greatly assist DARPA in this challenging
program. As you are likely aware, this belief is sup-
ported by the successes of DARPA’s Fundamentals of
Biology program which brought biologists, mathemati-cians, and physicists together to challenge conventional
biological paradigms.
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program
Prophecy and its goal of predicting pathogen evolution,
collaborations will be necessary and we envision that it
may take time to formulate productive teams. To this
end DARPA will be holding teaming meetings to intro-
duce potential responders to the Prophecy BAA and
encourage their collaboration in the pursuit of multi-
disciplinary approaches to the program. There will be
2 meetings which are described in the attached Special
Notice (DARPA-SN-10-48).
We hope that you will forward this Special Notice to the
Society membership and that the expertise of your com-
munity will help DARPA in achieving these challenging
objectives. Please note that there are two meetings over
the next six weeks that will precede the publication of
the BAA.
Regards,
Michael Callahan MD Program Manager, Prophecy

RepublicCapeVerde
VoluntaryFieldAssist
Field assistant wanted ? Republic of Cape Verde ? Sept
to Dec 2010
Can you: 1. Work long hours unsupervised 7 days per
week? 2. Find nest, and capture and ring shorebirds?
3. Contribute to your own expenses?
The project We are investigating breeding ecology and
behaviour of Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus
in Cape Verde by monitoring colour-ringed individu-
als. This is an all-year resident population and many
individuals are already ringed from previous years.
The place The study sites are in Maio Island, Cape
Verde, at the Salina Porto Ingles and nearby lagoons
(see the Bradt Guide to Cape Verde Islands). Accom-
modation on the islands is in an apartment, with oc-
casional water and electricity. The island has spectac-
ular wildlife, including endemic birds, corals and ma-
rine mammals; it is a beautiful and inspiring place to
work. However, the island is a small and isolated place
with basic commodities, the weather can be harsh and
a great deal of walking is required.July 1, 2010 EvolDir 45
The job The ﬁeldwork will run from 1 September to
mid December 2010. It will be unsupervised, and will
involve ? among other tasks ? searching for plover
nests and marked plovers and their families, taking be-
havioural observations and monitoring nest survival. It
will also involve capturing, ringing and bleeding adults
and young.
The candidate This is a volunteer post ? applicants
must be willing to pay for their own transport to Maio,
and to contribute to their expenses once there. How-
ever, we are applying for funding elsewhere and if suc-
cessful, these funds would cover the majority of ex-
penses.
You will be a keen birder with sharp eyes and plenty
of experience of trapping, handling and ringing birds.
Clean driving licence is essential. You must be person-
able and happy to engage with locals to explain the
project; some Spanish or Portuguese is helpful. You
must be physically ﬁt, hard-working and meticulous,
and have a proven ability to work independently. As
you will appreciate from its description, the project will
involve many diﬀerent challenges. A proven ability to
collect high-quality data is essential (i.e. a good de-
gree in a biological subject or equivalent experience),
and you should be prepared to type up your data in
the evenings! You must have a positive attitude and
an ability to look after yourself ? this means cooking
your own meals, dealing with logistics (such as ordering
food), and most importantly being capable of organis-
ing your own work for a substantial period of time. If
you like chatting on the phone, or feel the need to text
and email people all the time, this position is not for
you. The cost of living is high, and food is expensive.
Costs It is possible to ﬂy through Lisbon from the UK
that costs about £700. Internal ﬂights from Praia to
Maio should be under £100, and accommodation is £5
per night. I expect that a budget of £2000 would cover
your ﬂights and expenses for the whole ﬁeld season.
Interested? Please send a current CV with an email
stating why you feel you are a strong candidate to me
(Professor Tam´ as Sz´ ekely) at bssts@bath.ac.uk. Appli-
cation deadline: 16 July 2010.
I will also need the contact details (email and tele-
phone) of two referees. If you have any questions, please
direct them to me at the same email address, or call me
on UK 01225 383 676.

Small scale SNPs
Hi,
Has anyone got experience in (very) small scale SNP
genotyping? We’d like to quickly and cheaply type a
couple of SNPs in less than 100 genomic DNA samples,
but most of the popular technologies don’t seem to be
cost-eﬀective for such small project. A quick internet
search suggests that a service company might do it for
~£200, and DIY PCR + sequencing doesn’t seem to be
any cheaper. I also found some PCR-based methods
but quite a bit of optimisation needs to be done?

Software
NewVersionFLOCKProgram
FLOCK is designed to unravel genetic structure within
a collection of genotypes, whether pure or admixed. It
is assumed that pure, “source”, samples are not avail-
able. The program may be used to solve the “number
(K) of populations” problem, separate pure and ad-
mixed specimens into K groups (K is known), picture
structural relationships between samples. FLOCK is
a non- Bayesian method and therefore diﬀers substan-
tially from previous clustering algorithms. Its working
principle is repeated re-allocation of all collected speci-
mens (total sample) to the k subsamples. The number
of re-allocations until convergence typically stands be-
tween ﬁve and ten. The method was published as:
Duchesne P, Turgeon J (2009) FLOCK: a method for
quick mapping of admixture without source samples.
Molecular Ecology Resources 9: 1333-1344
A new version (2.0) is currently available. FLOCK
now signals by red printing all P Values that exceed
the Bonferroni corrected threshold (0.05/ number of
runs) so that runs that are not validated by alloca-
tion number tables are easily identiﬁed. Also, FLOCK
2.0 may be run for a sequence of values of k in a sin-
gle batch process. A separate output ﬁle, named the
plateau record, is now automatically generated to facil-
itate plateau analysis, a powerful tool to estimate K.

Software PhyRe
PhyloRepresentativeness
Dear EvolDir members, we are glad to inform you that
a new program evaluating phylogenetic coverage has
been released and is freely available on our lab website
at
http://www.mozoolab.net . We called our package
PhyRe, standing for PHYlogenetic REpresentativeness.
It is composed by three Python scripts; therefore, it is
platform-independent. Our idea is to deal with taxon
sampling issue with a completely a priori approach: in
this way, we can answer to the question “Did I sam-
ple taxa in my ingroup enough to conduct a phyloge-
netic study?” before starting the lab work. Phyloge-
netic Representativeness develops Taxonomic Distinct-
ness for phylogenetic purposes: only a reference tax-
onomy is needed, then the ingroup is compared to the
complete master list of organisms it stands for. Sev-
eral tests of randomization and shuﬄing have been in-
troduced to assess statistical conﬁdence. We hope this
concept can be useful to phylogeneticists planning their
work and conducting their research project. A paper
has been published on this topic:
Plazzi, F., Ferrucci, R. R., and Passamonti, M. (2010).

Evaluating Taxon Sampling in Evolutionary Studies.

Software TreeSnatcher Plus
We have ﬁnished a new version of our TreeSnatcher
Plus application. This is the link to the newwebsite: http://www.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/AG/BI/-
Software/treesnatcher Abstract (from the website):
TreeSnatcher Plus is a GUI-driven Java application for
the semi-automatic recognition of multifurcating phy-
logenetic trees in pixel images. The program accepts
an image ﬁle as input and analyzes the topology and
the metrics of a tree depicted with user assistance. The
analysis is carried out in a multiple-stage process us-
ing basic algorithms from the ﬁeld of image analysis.
It yields a Newick expression that represents the tree
structure optionally including branch lengths.
Due to some diﬀerences between the JAVA versions for
the three major OSes there is currently only a Mac
OS X version. However, the versions for Windows and
Linux will be available pretty soon.
We believe that the new application is much more ﬂex-
ible and usable now. as we have re-conceptualized and
extended our program from 2007. You can now prepro-
cess an image directly in TreeSnatcher Plus with a large
selection of tools. The program now recognizes rect-
angular topologies and can therefore deal with branch
lengths correctly.
Colleagues who like to try TreeSnatcher Plus for Mac
OS X are kindly encouraged to study the tutorials from
the website in detail. The tutorials serve as a substitute
for a manual.
We would be very grateful for comments, ideas, bug re-
ports, advice, or criticism and are happy to answer any
questions.
The source code will be made available on request.

SouthAfrica Volunteers
MammalEvol
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
1 male volunteer from July on, one female volunteer
from September onwards and more open positions af-
terwards
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an48 EvolDir July 1, 2010
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility
in the striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the
habitat is open, direct behavioral observations in the
ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are also expected to help with
maintenance of the research station (water pump, solar
power, etc.)
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 105 Euro) must be paid for accommo-
dation at the research station. For students with their
own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250 (approx.
130 Euro) per month applies. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
210 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 300 - 400 Euros per month. Students
get an invitation letter which they can use to apply for
funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany,
SANW in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
one male volunteer starting as soon as possible and one
female volunteer starting in September (this is due tospace constraints in the dorms). The volunteer project
is ongoing, i.e. positions will also be available in 2011.
Volunteers are expected to stay at least 2 months, but
longer periods of up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch.
Please send your application BEFORE the 10th of July
or after the 10th of August (no emails will be replied
to that are send between 10th July and 10th August).

Tropical bird feather DNA
Dear all,
I have a technical question and hope some of you are
willing to share their experience with me. We are writ-
ing a grant proposal to work on a large bird species,
from tropical South America.
Our experience working with feathers of (smaller) birds
from colder climates has been good. - What is the fea-
sibility of using feathers that may have been in the hot
and humid tropics for several weeks? Would this have a
bad eﬀect on the quality of the DNA? - Would it be bet-
ter to store the tip of the feather in ethanol or 5M NaCl
as soon as possible, or would that make no diﬀerence
(or even make it worse)? - What is the best/most eco-
nomical extraction method: Qiagen animal kit, Chelex,
or basic SDS/NaAc extraction?
Any advice welcome.50 EvolDir July 1, 2010

Viral qRT-PCR
Dear evoldir members and qRT-PCR experts,
I have started a new project and one of the techniques
I want to use is the qRT-PCR.
First of all let me explain the research topic:
The barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV, ssRNA-virus)
and the wheat dwarf virus (WDV, (DNA-Virus) are
widely distributed viral diseases of cereals. The virus
BYDV is transmitted by aphids and WDV is transmit-
ted by the leaf-hopper Psammotettix alienus. With the
qRT-PCR I want to know which aphid or leaf-hopper
carry the virus and maybe how many virus-particles.
Now my question:
What do you think is the best strategy: absolute or
relative quantiﬁcation? What should I use as a calibra-
tor? Do you think I should synthesize the standards
(synthetic genes)?
Thank you in advance for any advise or help!

advocates for preservation of the most diverse place on
the planet, the impending drive for oil development,
and the diﬃcult economic choices developing countries
need to make for themselves within a climate of inter-

governments. The deal Ecuador has proposed could
serve as an economic model of development for so
many other places - please watch this at the very least
to be aware. Plus, these presentations would be a great

Belgium EvolutionaryComputation
Three open positions for 2 PhD students and 1 post-
doc in the area of evolutionary computation / bio-
inspired computing Interdisciplinary research project
“Bio-inspired computing for coordination and control
in large-scale and dynamic systems (BioCo3)”
In this interdisciplinary project (involving computer
science, biology, operations research and logistics ex-
pertise) we will study decentralized approaches for con-
trolling large-scale, dynamic systems - e.g. for control-
ling a large number of vehicles that need to accomplish
transport tasks for clients (package delivery service).
Achieving eﬃcient and eﬀective collective behavior is
known to be quite a challenge, esp. if the systems are
large in scale and submitted to changing operating con-
ditions. Complex collective behaviour occurs in many
socio-biological systems. Social insects, e.g., are able
to ﬁnd the shortest path to food sources without any
central control, or can build enormously complex nestswith built-in ventilation systems, or divide the work
such that the chances of survival are optimal.
Some socio-biological mechanisms for collective behav-
ior have already been studied in the context of com-
puting (e.g. stigmergy and digital pheromones, or in
discrete optimization techniques, such as ant colony
optimization, artiﬁcial immune systems, genetic algo-
rithms). It becomes apparent, however, that (1) large-
scale and dynamic systems still hold major challenges,
and (2) many socio-biological concepts and techniques
have been unexplored.
The project therefore aims to study advanced concepts
and mechanisms, known from social biological systems,
and their applicability in decentralized control systems.
To guide the research, the project will use concrete ap-
plication scenarios, based on decentralized control in
pickup-and-delivery problems (PDPs), and evolution-
ary algorithms to evolve more eﬃcient control strate-
gies.

Bergen Norway
FishPopulationGenetics
The Institute of Marine Research has a two-year post
doctoral research position available to work with mod-
eling genetic interactions between wild and farmed ﬁsh.
The position will be connected to the Population Ge-
netics and Ecology research group in Bergen, Norway.
Closing date for applications: 10.07.10.
The position will be linked to the modeling work-
package in the Strategic Institute Project “INTER-
ACT”, ﬁnanced by the Norwegian research council.
Building upon published data, current models and
state-of the art, the work-package aims to advance mod-
els to quantify the interactions between wild and farmed
ﬁshes, for both Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon. The
ultimate aim is to identify “break points” for tolerance
of genetic introgression in wild populations.
Together with members of the research team, the ap-
pointee will have responsibility for establishing, testing
and publishing new models that shed light onto the
consequences of farmed escapees and tolerable levels of
introgression in wild populations. This will be achieved
through developing models describing dynamics of wild
salmon and cod populations that are interacting and
potentially interbreeding with conspeciﬁc ﬁsh of aqua-
culture origin. Important parameters to be tested in-
clude numbers of escapees, ﬁtness of hybrids, and be-
havioural interactions between wild and cultured ﬁsh.
We wish to appoint a highly motivated person with a
PhD in modeling, statistical genetics, population ecol-
ogy or related discipline. The appointee will need toJuly 1, 2010 EvolDir 53
be able to document experience of programming and
use of models to study dynamical systems in biology.
Previous experience with modelling of ﬁsh population
dynamics is not necessary but is considered advanta-
geous.
The Institute emphasises personal qualities such as
good communication and cooperative skills, the abil-
ity to work independently and as part of an active re-
search team. A record of publishing in this ﬁeld will be
considered an advantage.
We oﬀer:
* a positive, challenging and creative work environment
* the opportunity to work in a national institute with
a high level of international contact * ﬂexible hours, a
good pension scheme and a wide range of welfare ser-
vices.
The Institute oﬀers governmental regulated salaries as
post doctor (code 1352 post doctor).

Project description:
Postdoctoral position Fonds National de la Recherche
Scientiﬁque - D. micans
The aim of the proposed research will be to complement
a general study of the contemporary and past disper-
sal of the bark beetle Dendroctonus micans (Scolytine)
by analyzing its population structure with molecular
markers. D. micans is probably of Siberian origin and
has been gradually moving into Western Europe since
the late nineteenth century. The whole life cycle of this
insect occurs within the phloem of living spruces, de-spite the presence of toxic monoterpenes in the resin.
The larvae are gregarious. The sex ratio is unbalanced,
ranging from 1:10 to 1:40 in favor of females. After
metamorphosis, the young males mate with their sis-
ters, so that 98% of the emerging females are fertilized
by their brothers. Each female is then immediately
able to colonize a new host. The adults are not gre-
garious and attack their host tree solitarily. For a long
time, it was thought that the males never leave their na-
tal gallery, because they mate within them. However,
males have recently been trapped in the forest (passive
interception traps) in ratios similar to those observed
in the galleries. This raises questions over the fate of
these males and over the function of their ﬂights. Do
the ﬂying males enter other chambers containing pre-
emergent broods, or do they join their sisters in their
new galleries? Only one adult female is usually found in
the newly formed egg galleries. A preliminary study of
genetic variation suggests low levels of variation within
populations, but has identiﬁed a couple of microsatel-
lite loci for which diﬀerent alleles are ﬁxed in diﬀer-
ent populations sampled in France and Belgium. The
proposed postdoc will focus on the indentiﬁcation of
additional molecular markers and their use for charac-
terizing the genetic structure of D. micans populations.
These molecular data will be combined with behavioral
data and a ﬁeld study directly assessing the movement
of the beetles, in order to increase our understanding
of the dispersal strategy of this insect pest.

SalamanderTransposableElements
Post-Doctoral Position Mueller Lab Department of Bi-
ology Colorado State University
An NSF-funded post-doctoral position in evolutionary
genomics is available in the Biology Department at Col-
orado State University. The position is focused on
genome evolution in plethodontid salamanders, which
have among the largest vertebrate genomes: 15 to ~75
Gb. Although such genomes are known to consist
largely of repetitive DNA, the repeat elements, their
mutational dynamics, and the ways in which these dy-
namics translate into large and variable genome sizes
remain almost completely uncharacterized. The post-
doc will use next-gen sequencing data to study the mu-
tational processes underlying this extreme genomic ex-
pansion.
The postdoc will interact with collaborators at UC Den-ver (David Pollock, the Consortium for Comparative
Genomics) and UT Arlington (C´ edric Feschotte) to 1)
identify and characterize novel repeat elements from
several species of plethodontids, which diverged ~40-90
mya, and 2) analyze the tempo and mode of repeat el-
ement evolution, and the relationship with genomic ex-
pansion, in a phylogenetic context. These results will
be combined with ongoing comparative methods-based
analyses of plethodontid genome size evolution.
A Ph.D. in evolutionary or comparative genomics, or in
a closely-related ﬁeld, is required by the position start-
date. The position is available as soon as a suitable
candidate is identiﬁed. Start-date is negotiable.
The Department of Biology at Colorado State Univer-
sity is an interdisciplinary group with a strong crew
of evolutionary biologists. Fort Collins is a beautiful
city of 120,000 people located at the base of the Rocky

Finland 2 MolecularSystematics 2
Apologies, the deadline for applying for the recently ad-
vertised positions is 30 JUNE 2010, not July as in the
original e-mail. My mistake. Here is the advertisement
again (with the correct dates):
Two postdoctoral positions are available in the newly
funded project “Diversiﬁcation of plant-feeding insects
over millions of years: what is the role of dramatic cli-
mate changes?” (funding from the Kone Foundation)
headed by Niklas Wahlberg (University of Turku, Fin-land) and Tommi Nyman (University of Eastern Fin-
land). A strong background in molecular systematics is
required for both positions. The positions are available
for one year starting in September 2010, with a possibil-
ity to extend for a second and third year. Salary will be
2100euro per month (non-negotiable) paid as a tax free
stipend up to 18,800euro per year, with 6400euro per
year subject to taxes (in practice, about 1900euro per
month net income). One postdoc will work in Turku,
Finland, the other in Joensuu, Finland, with active in-
teraction planned between research groups.
The postdoc in Turku will work in the research group of
Niklas Wahlberg ( http://nymphalidae.utu.ﬁ ), expand-
ing the work on Nymphalidae butterﬂies to other lep-
idopteran groups (Geometridae and Noctuoidea). The
major focus of this postdoc will be to generate new
molecular data for geometrid moths, assist in generat-
ing molecular data for noctuids, and take responsibil-
ity in analyzing resulting data using phylogenetic meth-
ods. The candidate should particularly be familiar with
methods used to analyze changes in rates of diversiﬁ-
cation over evolutionary time (e.g., with algorithms in
programs such as SymmeTree and Medusa). Interested
persons should send their CV, a statement of why they
are interested, and contact information of two refer-
ences to Niklas Wahlberg (niklas.wahlberg@utu.ﬁ) by
the 30 JUNE 2010.
The postdoc in Joensuu will work in the research group
of Tommi Nyman ( www.joensuu.ﬁ/biologia/nyman ),
and focus on the diversiﬁcation history of sawﬂies (the
mostly herbivorous basal grade of Hymenoptera). The
ﬁrst task of this postdoc will be to increase the number
of easily ampliﬁable nuclear genes to be used for phylo-
genetic and timing of diversiﬁcation analyses. The can-
didate should be familiar with whole-genome databases,
publicly available EST libraries, primer design, and lab
practices when developing new markers. The candi-
date will be expected to generate new molecular data
for sawﬂies, and to take responsibility for analyzing the
resulting data using phylogenetic methods. Interested
persons should send their CV, a statement of why they
are interested, and contact information of two refer-
ences to Tommi Nyman (tommi.nyman@uef.ﬁ) by the
30 JUNE 2010.
The project will facilitate numerous comparative anal-
yses that will shed light on common patterns in the
evolutionary radiations of two species-rich and ecolog-
ically important insect herbivore taxa. Both research
groups are young, dynamic, and innovative; a perfect
opportunity to take advantage of a robust background

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH PROJECT RE-
SEARCH CHAIR IN SYLVICULTURE AND60 EvolDir July 1, 2010
WILDLIFE
The NSERC-Universit´ e Laval Industrial Research
Chair in Silviculture and Wildlife has research oppor-
tunities for one post-doctoral fellow to participate in
its research program. This program seeks to develop
silviculture systems suited for the sustainable manage-
ment of uneven-aged boreal forests. The post-doctoral
project should commence no later than August 2010,
with a duration of 1-2 years. A fellowship of 35,000$
per year will be available.
* Research theme 1: Modelling animal communities
in managed boreal forest. The project aims to model
animal-habitat relationships in the managed forests of
the Cˆ ote-Nord region of Qu´ ebec. The study will in-
tegrate information on forest structure, composition,
and management with data on animal communities
that have been collected as part of the chair’s studies.
Species groups to be considered include invertebrates,
forest birds, and small mammals. A number of indi-
cator species have been identiﬁed in uncut forests. We
now need to determine whether these species are also
adequate indicators of local species assemblages in post-
logging forests. The following article presents one way
to analyse the data:
Azeria et al. 2009. Using null model analysis of species
co-occurrences to deconstruct biodiversity patterns and
select indicator species. Diversity and Distributions 15:
958-71.
The study should also evaluate the response of the in-
dicator species to landscape characteristics in order to
subsequently map broad-scale patterns of biodiversity.
* Research theme 2: Response of animal communities
to various silvicultural practices. The post-doctoral fel-
low could characterize the impact of silvicultural prac-
tices on the foraging behaviour of small mammals. The
results should reveal spatio-temporal variations in the
perception of foragers to predation risk and competi-
tion intensity. The following paper presents a similar
study:
Lemaˆ ıtre et al. 2010. Deer mice mediate red-backed
vole behaviour and abundance along a gradient of habi-
tat alteration. Evolutionary Ecology Research 12: 203-
16.
The post-doctoral fellow could also become involved in
other on-going studies. We are therefore looking for
candidates with broad interests and skills. Please visit
“www.sylvifaune.ulaval.ca” to ﬁnd out more about the
chair’s studies.
The post-doctoral fellow will have administrative re-
sponsibilities, which include: 1. Writing scientiﬁc pa-pers, progress reports, and posters. 2. Helping to plan
and supervise ﬁeldwork. 3. Maintaining the project’s
database; as well as supervising and verifying contri-
butions from employees and students. 4. Developing
and maintaining links with practitioners, managers and
researchers in order to promote an exchange on chair-
related work. 5. Advising and assisting researchers and
students in their studies.
Qualiﬁcations: Hold a PhD in terrestrial ecology,
forestry, biostatistics or related ﬁeld. Have extensive
research experience in animal or community ecology.
Have in-depth knowledge of ecological modelling and
contemporary multivariate statistical methods. Be fa-
miliar with the use of Geographic Information Systems.
Universit´ e Laval is a French university and some basic
French is an asset.
Documents to provide by email: Applicants for this po-
sition should forward me a short cover letter indicating
their motivation, accompanied by a current CV and the
names and contact information of three references. We
will begin to review the applications on July 2nd 2010:

tions associated with a multi-investigator, collaborative
project to identify the traits, genes and gene networks
involved in adaptation to natural environments. Team
members include Doug Schemske (Michigan State Uni-
versity; evolutionary ecology, adaptation, speciation),
Mike Thomashow (Michigan State University; gene
regulatory networks, transcriptome, molecular genetic
analysis of cold acclimation), John McKay (Colorado
State University; physiological adaptation, drought tol-
erance), Barbara Demmig-Adams and William Adams
(University of Colorado; photosynthesis and photopro-
tection) and Jon Agren (Uppsala University; adapta-
tion, plant evolutionary ecology). Our research ad-
dresses the following questions: 1) What are the Quan-
titative Trait Loci (QTL) that contribute to adaptation
in nature and to key traits involved in adaptation. 2)
How does the substitution of adaptive QTL inﬂuence
the phenotype, gene expression/regulation and plant
ﬁtness? 3) Are there adaptive tradeoﬀs between traitsJuly 1, 2010 EvolDir 63
and/or pleiotropy between adaptive QTL? 4) What are
the individual genes underlying adaptive QTL?
The research associated with this particular position
will be conducted in close collaboration with Doug
Schemske (MSU) and Jon Agren (Uppsala University).
Responsibilities include ﬁeldwork in Europe (Italy, Swe-
den) to establish and monitor large-scale ﬁeld experi-
ments, laboratory research in Michigan to conduct QTL
mapping of Recombinant Inbred Lines and to produce
Near Isogenic Lines, data analysis and the preparation
of manuscripts for publication, and assistance in the or-
ganization of workshops on career development. Pref-
erence will be given to candidates with a background in
ecology, population and/or evolutionary biology, expe-
rience with ﬁeld experiments, familiarity with molecu-
lar techniques, and a basic understanding of techniques

Norway FishGeneticInteractions
Post Doctoral position: Modeling genetic interactions
between wild and farmed ﬁsh
The Institute of Marine Research has a two-year post
doctoral research position available to work with mod-
eling genetic interactions between wild and farmed ﬁsh.
The position will be connected to the Population Ge-
netics and Ecology research group in Bergen.
The position will be linked to the modeling work-
package in the Strategic Institute Project “INTER-
ACT”, ﬁnanced by the Norwegian research council.
Building upon published data, current models and
state-of the art, the work-package aims to advance mod-
els to quantify the interactions between wild and farmed
ﬁshes, for both Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon. The
ultimate aim is to identify “break points” for tolerance
of genetic introgression in wild populations.
Together with members of the research team, the ap-
pointee will have responsibility for establishing, testing
and publishing new models that shed light onto the
consequences of farmed escapees and tolerable levels of
introgression in wild populations. This will be achieved
through developing models describing dynamics of wild
salmon and cod populations that are interacting and
potentially interbreeding with conspeciﬁc ﬁsh of aqua-
culture origin. Important parameters to be tested in-July 1, 2010 EvolDir 65
clude numbers of escapees, ﬁtness of hybrids, and be-
havioural interactions between wild and cultured ﬁsh.
We wish to appoint a highly motivated person with a
PhD in modeling, statistical genetics, population ecol-
ogy or related discipline. The appointee will need to
be able to document experience of programming and
use of models to study dynamical systems in biology.
Previous experience with modelling of ﬁsh population
dynamics is not necessary but is considered advanta-
geous.
The Institute emphasises personal qualities such as
good communication and cooperative skills, the abil-
ity to work independently and as part of an active re-
search team. A record of publishing in this ﬁeld will be
considered and advantage.
We oﬀer:
* a positive, challenging and creative work environment
* the opportunity to work in a national institute with
a high level of international contact * ﬂexible hours, a
good pension scheme and a wide range of welfare ser-
vices.
The Institute oﬀers governmental regulated salaries as
post doctor (code 1352 post doctor).

didate to assist in the development of an emerging
conservation science program for burrowing owls and
the habitat on which they depend. Western burrow-
ing owl populations appear to be in decline and may
soon require federal or state listing as an Endangered
Species. The successful candidate will develop a re-
search program to address major conservation threats
to the species in Southern California and begin to de-July 1, 2010 EvolDir 69
velop a comprehensive strategic regional conservation
plan. Understanding the distribution and abundance
patterns in relationship to habitat characteristics is
critical for managing species across multiple habitat
types fragmented over an extensive area. Also essen-
tial is identifying the population-genetic structure, or
phylogeography, for the region, with the long-term goal
of understanding population evolutionary history. For
management, estimates of gene ﬂow and genetic diver-
gence, coupled with knowledge of geographic barriers
and divergent ecological adaptation, is required. Un-
derstanding spatial ecology, including the distribution
of burrowing owls on the landscape, dispersal and mi-
gration patterns, as well as ﬁne-scale movements and
habitat use within home ranges, is yet another pressing
need. Active management strategies, such as translo-
cation and habitat restoration, also require systematic
testing to increase their eﬃcacy.
Goals for the research program may include developing
a spatially explicit model that addresses habitat needs,
conservation threats, and genetic viability. This model
will serve as a blueprint for conservation management,
including translocation programs, when needed. An ad-
ditional goal may be to develop optimal translocation
strategies, using adaptive management methods. The
successful candidate will work closely with conserva-
tion partners from governmental and nongovernmental
agencies and with other researchers at the Institute.
The successful candidate will design and implement re-
search; collect data and train others in data collection;
organize and analyze data; create action plans for fu-
ture conservation eﬀorts; share results with relevant
GO’s and NGO’s involved in implementing conserva-
tion measures, and at conferences and workshops; pre-
pare manuscripts for publication; and become involved
in outreach and education. The postdoctoral fellow is
expected to build a collaborative research program with
Institute scientists from several disciplines (for details

Postdoctoral positions available in the Department of
Genetics (14 June 2010)
Two postdoctoral positions are available in the Aqua-
culture Division, Department of Genetics, Stellenbosch
University with the project title “Genetic improvement
of the abalone Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the shores of South Africa and is the only one of
the ﬁve endemic species that is commercially exploited.July 1, 2010 EvolDir 71
Haliotis midae displays a very slow growth rate, tak-
ing two to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an
obstacle for proﬁtable farming and global competitive-
ness. In order to increase the productivity and the prof-
itability of the commercial abalone industry, a research
program has been designed which makes use of mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. Two key outputs of this program for which
two postdoctoral positions are available include: 1) The
production of a transcriptome sequence of Haliotis mi-
dae utilizing next generation sequencing technologies
including the Illumina Genome Analysis platform and
the GS FLX platform and utilizing this for amongst
others marker development. 2) The generation of com-
prehensive linkage maps and identiﬁcation of QTLs uti-
lizing microsatellite and SNP markers.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for: 1) Bioinformatic data analysis within this frame-
work. This will include developing an in-depth under-
standing of tailored genomic analytical software pack-
ages for EST, transcriptome and gene expression anal-
ysis in order to conduct research and provide post-
graduate students with bioinformatics support; keeping
abreast of new developments in the areas of bioinfor-
matics, transcriptome analysis and abalone research;
the maintenance of a comprehensive sample tracking
system; assisting laboratory staﬀ and students with
their research data output requirements. 2) Link-
age and QTL mapping analysis within this framework.
This will include utilizing currently available marker
and data resources as well as initializing further link-
age and QTL mapping design; providing postgraduate
students with data analysis support; keeping abreast of
new developments in the areas of linkage mapping, QTL
mapping and abalone research in general; the mainte-
nance of a comprehensive sample tracking system.
Minimum requirements: 1) PhD with specialization in
Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Genetics, Genomics or
a closely related discipline. Candidates should have a
strong computational background (DNA sequence anal-
ysis, evolutionary genetics/biology and gene expression
data analysis) and proﬁciency in relevant software pack-
ages. 2) PhD with specialization in Biotechnology, Ge-
netics, Genomics or a closely related discipline. Candi-
dates should have a strong computational background
(DNA sequence analysis, linkage mapping, QTL map-
ping) and proﬁciency in relevant software packages.
Recommended requirements: Proven experience with
SNP analyses (bioinformatic or mapping analysis).
Project management experience; excellent organiza-
tional and communication skills; proven ability to set
deadlines and meet milestones.These positions are available for 2 years with the pos-
sibility of extension. Commencement of duties as soon
as possible but no later than November 2010.

PostDoc position - Spatial Modelling
Modelling the ecological implications of the spread of
genes from transgenic crop into wild relatives
Project information: In order to assess the ecological
implications associated with the introduction of trans-
genic crops the Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) has
launched the focal programme Ecology Regarding Ge-netically Modiﬁed Organisms (ERGO). The project
“Introgression of crop (trans-)genes into wild rela-
tives: hybrid ﬁtness, background selection and hitch-
hiking” (for more info see vacancies at www.rug.nl/-
biol/theobio ) is a joint eﬀort of the Universities of
Groningen (Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary
Studies,), Amsterdam (Institute for Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Dynamics) and Wageningen (Laboratory for
Plant Breeding,). The project comprises both various
experimental studies (in which the wild lettuce species
Lactuca serriola is used as a model) and a theoretical
approach. This job oﬀer concerns the subproject “The
potential spread of crop genes in a crop/wild system:
analysis and modelling of an invasive process.” It is
the continuation of a previous project (for more info see
vacancies at www.rug.nl/biol/theobio ) and the models
developed in this earlier project should serve as a point
of departure.
Project description: Computer models will be devel-
oped for the spatial dispersal of transgenes (through
pollen, seed, or vegetatively) in wild populations. The
main objective is to predict the dispersal pattern and
invasion prospects of a transgene on basis of the genet-
ics and life history of the plant species involved. The
potential eﬀect of transgenes on dispersal characteris-
tics will receive special attention. Model development
will strongly reﬂect the developments in the related
projects. The models developed in various subprojects
will be integrated and validated with existing data, in-
cluding those generated on L. serriola.
Proﬁle: PhD with knowledge of population biology,
population genetics and modelling. Extensive expe-
rience with programming and computer simulations.
Good communication skills for interaction within a mul-
tidisciplinary programme.
Renumeration: Depending on age and experience, the
gross salary per month will range between Euro 2861
and Euro 3088. Duration of the contract: 2.5 years
(with an evaluation after the ﬁrst year).
Location: Theoretical Biology Group at the Centre
for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies (CEES) of the
University of Groningen (The Netherlands). The group
develops theory in two major research areas: evolu-
tionary ecology and self-organization. Current research
projects focus on evolutionary game theory, life his-
tory theory, evolutionary immunology, kin selection,
sex determination, sex allocation, sexual selection, sex-
ual conﬂict, metapopulation genetics, sympatric speci-
ation, allometric scaling laws, resource and interference

Our laboratory is eager to receive application from
highly motivated scientists with an excellent record to
apply to a Quebec government fellowship available for
non-Canadian candidates to do research in a Quebec-
based laboratory. Post-doctoral fellowships are avail-
able (1 year, 35,000 CAN$). Internships are also avail-
able for a visit to our laboratory (3,000 CAN$/month,
up to 4 months). Pre-selection by the host university
and our laboratory is mandatory.
Candidates from all over the world are invited to ap-
ply. Additionally, speciﬁc fellowships are available for
candidates from Mexico, Brazil, China and Wallonie.
We are in the Department of Biology at Laval Univer-
sity, located in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Our lab-
oratory is part of the Institute of Integrative and Sys-
tems Biology (IBIS). We study the underlying molec-
ular and hormonal causes of variation in behaviour in
vertebrates. We are interested in personality with an
emphasis on the stress response and correlation among
behaviours, as well as in reproductive tactics. We are
also interested by the eﬀects of the environment on de-
velopment of behaviour, such as environmental enrich-
ment in captive animals, maternal/paternal and social
group eﬀects, and endocrine disrupters. We therefore
have a strong interest for phenotypic plasticity, along
with the eﬀects of genetic variation. We favour an in-
tegrative approach by linking data from the same in-
dividual: neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and their
receptors (quantitative Real-Time PCR, microarrays,
in situ hybridization, HPLC), hormones (EIA, HPLC),
physiology and behaviour. Our model system is thethreespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, a small
ﬁsh studied in behavioural biology, which can be kept
easily in the lab and whose genome is sequenced.
Laval University is one of the ten main Canadian uni-
versities. Quebec City is dynamic with all the advan-
tages of a large city while still allowing for very easy
access to wilderness and very reasonable cost of living.
The chosen candidates that are successful at obtaining
a fellowship will be part of the Institute of Integrative
and Systems Biology. They will have access to core
genomics and molecular biology facilities, lab meetings
and Institute-wide group meetings, journal clubs and
weekly seminars at the Institute and in the Biology
Department. Several ecological genomics laboratories
are part of the Institute and the Biology department,
allowing for enriched interactions with members of the

Reports to: Professor Martin Richards
Responsible to: Director of Institute of Integrative and
Comparative Biology
Background to the post
The post is part of a three-year Leverhulme Trust-
funded research project, and forms part of a larger re-
search program, funded by a number of sources, that
is running in the Archaeogenetics Research Laboratory
that aims to use complete mtDNA sequence variation
to elucidate aspects of prehistoric dispersals and settle-
ments, especially in Southwest Asia and Europe.
Summary of the research programme
The emerging ﬁeld of archaeogenetics has become a cru-
cial part of the project of reconstructing the human
past - especially mapping out prehistoric populationdispersals. It achieves this mainly by studying non-
recombining genetic markers in extant human popula-
tions - in particular, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
which tracks the maternal line of descent, and the Y
chromosome, for the male lineage. Analysing variation
in these markers allows us to reconstruct genealogical
lines of descent and compare distributions of lineages
from one population to another, in order to estimate
the timing of migrations between them - an approach
known as phylogeography. More speciﬁcally, we can use
the variation accumulated exclusively within the popu-
lation of a part of the world settled during prehistoric
times, along with an estimate of the mutation rate or
“molecular clock”, to estimate the time of settlement -
a procedure we have christened “founder analysis”.
Most work on European and Near Eastern mtDNA in
the past has focused on a short stretch of the mtDNA
control region. The problems with this work are both
a lack of genealogical resolution and very imprecise age
estimates. In this project, funded by the Leverhulme
Trust, we are applying the phylogeographic approach
to complete mtDNA genome sequences, which provide
a step-change in the level of resolution we can achieve.
We will focus on the Near East, especially Anatolia, in
order to study the ﬁrst settlement and subsequent de-
mographic history of human populations in that part
of the world. Because of the Near East’s crucial role
in west Eurasian prehistory, however, this research will
allow us to illuminate the dispersal history of a much
wider region.
The Near East is widely held to have been the source of
European populations in both the Upper Palaeolithic -
the ﬁrst settlement by modern humans, ~45 kya (thou-
sand years ago) - and, in some models, the Neolithic,
from ~9 kya. Yet relatively little genetic research has
been devoted to the region. There has been no con-
certed attempt to reconstruct the demographic history
of the Near East from mtDNA sequences - in part, be-
cause of the poor resolution of the mtDNA control re-
gion referred to above. Moreover, previous work on the
settlement of Europe similarly suﬀers from those weak-
nesses. In this project, we will combine the new com-
plete mtDNA genomes from Anatolia with data we are
generating from other parts of the Near East and Eu-
rope. We will ﬁrst target relict lineages from through-
out the region in order to address the question of ﬁrst
settlement and then focus on Anatolia - a crucial bridge

nomics and Association Mapping
As part of a multi-investigator project we are in the
process of collecting whole-genome sequence data from
several hundred genotypes of the model legume Med-
icago truncatula, as well as individuals of several related
Medicago species. I am now looking for a post-doc to
help in analyzing these data to investigate evolutionary
forces shaping genome diversity as well as the genetic
basis of phenotypic traits. We are particularly inter-
ested in identifying and characterizing the evolutionary
history of genes mediating the mutualism between Med-
icago and symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxing rhizobia bacteria.
The position will involve some work with greenhouse
experiments and the collection of phenotypic data. You
would be working with several post-docs and gradu-
ate students with diverse computational and laboratory
skills. There will be considerable opportunity to pursue
ones own interests within the general framework of the
project.
Interest and experience in statistical and population ge-
netics, handling large data sets, and some programming
skills are highly desired.
A late-summer start date is preferred but this is ﬂexible.
We oﬀer competitive salary with full health beneﬁts.
Travel funds are also available for attending scientiﬁc
meetings.
The U of M has a large urban campus on the banks of
the Mississippi River with many activities and enter-
tainment in the Twin Cities, great restaurants, biking,

Postdoctoral research position on the evolution of
repetitive DNA in a group of non-photosynthetic ﬂow-
ering plants
I am looking for a postdoc (2 yrs, possibly 3 yrs) inter-
ested in the evolution of repetitive DNA. We are apply-
ing 454 pyrosequencing to characterize repetitive DNA

hypothesis that this is mainly due to their repetitive
DNA fractions by comparing seven species of known
relationship and genome characteristics. The primary
novelty of this project is the broad comparative context,
which will allow assessing evolutionary trends. Three
full plates of 454 data are in hand, and data analysis
can begin now.
Other ongoing research topics in our group can be found

Vienna DrosophilaAging
Vienna, Austria: POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN
DROSOPHILA AGING
A postdoctoral research position in the genetics of
Drosophila aging is available in the group of Thomas
Flatt at the University of Veterinary Medicine (Depart-
ment of Biomedical Research, Institute of Population
Genetics), Vienna, Austria. The postdoc position is
funded by a grant from the Austrian Science Founda-
tion (FWF) and will be for three years.
This research project will focus on the identiﬁcation
of the molecular basis of the trade-oﬀ between re-
production and lifespan in the fruit ﬂy, Drosophila
melanogaster, a powerful genetic model system. In
many organisms, from fruit ﬂies to humans, reproduc-
tion shortens lifespan, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown (see Flatt & Promislow 2007 in Sci-
ence). Experiments in C. elegans suggest that hor-
monal signals from the gonad aﬀect longevity (Hsin &
Kenyon 1999 in Nature), and we have recently found
that germline ablation extends lifespan and aﬀects in-
sulin signaling in Drosophila (Flatt et al. 2008 in84 EvolDir July 1, 2010
PNAS). However, the details of this systemic regula-
tion of lifespan by the reproductive system remain un-
clear. In our project we are interested in dissecting
the hormonal and metabolic mechanisms that modu-
late the reproduction-longevity trade-oﬀ. By employing
mutant and transgene analysis, genetic manipulation of
the gonad, epistasis experiments, metabolic measure-
ments, and hormonal manipulations we will examine
the endocrine mechanisms whereby signals from the re-
productive system modulate adult longevity and phys-
iology.
We are seeking a talented, independent, hard-working
and self- motivated young biologist with good social
skills. The successful candidate will have a Ph.D. and
a strong background in genetics and molecular biol-
ogy using the Drosophila system. Some background
in the biology of aging, evolutionary biology, and/or
endocrinology would be ideal, but is not required. The
working language in the laboratory is English, so the
candidate should be proﬁcient in spoken and written
English. German skills, although helpful, are not es-
sential. The initial appointment will be made for one
year, with a possible extension to up to three years.
The annual salary is 56,110 Euro (before tax). The po-
sition is available as of now, but the starting date is
negotiable.
In a 2009 world-wide survey by the William M. Mercer
Institute, Vienna ranked ﬁrst world-wide in terms of
standards of living. Vienna is a beautiful, historical yet
modern city, located in the heart of Europe, close to the
Alps and to major cities like Munich, Zurich, Prague,
and Budapest. Being famous for its concert sites, opera
houses, theathers, museums, and coﬀee shops, Vienna
also provides great outdoor activities, such as sailing
on the Neusiedler See, ice skating, biking and hiking in
the Viennese woods and the nearby Alps. Moreover,
the city has a wide range of great restaurants, bars,
wineries, cinemas, clubs, libraries, galleries, and art col-
lections. The Vienna area is also an exceptional and
highly international research environment. Four major
life science universities and three world-class research
institutes (GMI, IMBA, IMP) provide a dynamic and
interactive setting. Vienna hosts an active Drosophila
community, and the onsite availability of the Drosophila
RNAi center (VDRC) provides a great opportunity for
functional Drosophila work. In population genetics and
evolutionary biology, the Vienna research area also pro-
vides excellent prospects, due to a growing number of
evolutionary research groups.

Position Title: Postdoctoral Scientist, Microscale Mi-
crobial Biogeography, Bay Paul Center.
Position Summary: A postdoctoral position using ad-
vanced imaging and next-generation sequencing of leaf
surface microbial communities to study microbial bio-
geography at small scales is available in Sheri Sim-
monsˆ as lab at the Bay Paul Center, Marine Biological
Laboratory, Woods Hole MA.
Additional Information: In recent years several studies
have examined whether microbial systems demonstrate
the same ecological patterns documented in macro-
organisms, with a particular emphasis on factors pro-
ducing biogeographical patterns of microbial diversityand whether deterministic or neutral factors dominate
community assembly. However, two central issues have
not been addressed: (1) sampling typically occurs on
length scales many orders of magnitude larger than a
typical microbial cell and (2) usually only taxonomic
(16s) diversity is assayed.
The successful candidate will have the opportunity to
develop leaf surface microbial communities into a model
system for assaying (i) how microbial community as-
sembly operates at ˆ amicrobialˆ a (micrometer to centime-
ter) scales and (ii) whether taxonomic, genetic, and
functional measures of microbial diversity (as assayed
with high-throughput next-gen sequencing) show com-
mon patterns over space and time.
The suite of tools available for this project include : a
MBL-owned greenhouse for controlled growth of model
plants, expertise in next-gen (454/Illumina) sequencing
and microbial community imaging, a Zeiss PALM Com-
biSystem for laser microdissection of individual leaves,
and substantial bioinformatics capacity in the Bay Paul
Center.
Funding support is available for 2 years with the poten-
tial for extension. Review of applications will continue
until the position is ﬁlled.
Basic Qualiﬁcations: A Ph.D. in the biological sciences;
applicants with diverse backgrounds are encouraged to
apply. Experience in one or more of the following areas
is preferred: molecular microbial ecology techniques,
ecological theory, plant biology, FISH/imaging, bioin-
formatics, and/or analysis of next-generation sequenc-
ing data. The candidate should be interested in inter-
disciplinary research and have excellent communication
skills (oral and written).
Required Applicant Documents: CV, cover letter, 3 ref-
erences, Research Goals
Special Instructions to Applicants: Please submit three
items: (i) a cover letter describing your research goals
and your speciﬁc motivation to join the lab, (ii) a CV,
and (iii) contact information for three references, in-
cluding your Ph.D. supervisor.

The use of omics technology (genomics, transcrip-
tomics, proteomics, metabolomics) in evolutionary and
ecological biology is increasing. This workshop will aim
to explore the diﬀerent levels of omics technology in
an ecological and evolutionary context with a focus on
methods and analysis of diﬀerent omics technology as
well as exploring how these diﬀerent technologies can
be integrated to form a systems view of evolutionary
biology.
In this Ph.D course and workshop we bring together re-
searchers with a primary focus on the use and integra-
tion of omics techniques in evolutionary and conserva-
tion biology. We have organised attendance from lead-ing scientists in the ﬁeld that will give lectures on rel-
evant topics. The students will receive a compendium
with original research articles representing the latest re-
search within the topic. During the course time will be
set aside for group discussions on central themes based
on the articles, and also there will be time to discuss
your own projects. Students will be expected to ac-
tively participate in the workshop with a presentation
of either a talk or poster on your design or results in
order to obtain 5 ECTS.

Course Description: In medicine and agriculture, man-
aging evolution is commonplace. Breeders of domesti-
cated animals and plants have steered evolution for mil-
lennia, whereas during past decades, attempts to avoid
resistance evolution has become a major issue in both
human health and agriculture. In dealing with wild
populations, awakening to contemporary evolution has
just started. Yet there is little doubt that humans are
the greatest evolutionary force of modern times. Wher-
ever humans are present, pristine habitats are absent
or rare, and even the most remote places are inﬂuenced
by climate change and pollutants. Humans transport
animals and plants to novel environments. Populations
that are resources to humans may have humans as their
primary predator or herbivore. All these changes have
evolutionary implications, and understanding them is
an important task in managing and conserving the en-
vironment.
The course is an opportunity to bring together young
and experienced scientists with various backgrounds in
evolutionary ecology. The course aims to present the-
ory and techniques, statistical and modeling, to mea-
sure human-induced evolution in marine, freshwater,
and terrestrial environments, covering topics from the
eﬀects of environmental degradation and noise pollu-
tion through to selective removal of individuals (hunt-
ing). The course will suit both experienced postdocs
and doctoral students curious in expanding their quan-
titative skills.Intended audience: The course will be of interest
to those working on organisms spanning both terres-
trial and aquatic systems in evolutionary ecology, ﬁsh-
eries, behavioral ecology, life history theory (includ-
ing exploitation-induced and contemporary evolution),
wildlife biology, and conservation biology.

Environmental Genomics/199/ Environmental
genomics seeks to understand how gene function is
inﬂuenced by environmental conditions while account-
ing for variation that exists within and among natural
populations. Two signiﬁcant advances create oppor-
tunities to ﬁnally link gene-environment interactions
to the ﬁtness of individuals and to population-level
outcomes. (1) Genome and transcriptome sequences
are rapidly becoming available for a growing number
of species whose ecology and physiology are well un-
derstood. (2) Sophisticated tools for high-throughput
biology, statistical analysis and informatics are rapidly
becoming more accessible to single investigator labora-
tories. This course is built on the paradigm that the
research ﬁeld will most eﬀectively grow by properly
designing large-scale experiments enabled by drasti-
cally increased sample-throughput and lower costs.
Most importantly, the challenges of manipulating and
analyzing population-level genomics data must be
addressed.
This course trains researchers to design studies, and
to collect and analyze state-of-the-art gene expression
data. Each participant will perform a new experiment
using 12-plex microarrays that are designed to study
the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia. The class re-
sults will be combined for a scientiﬁc publication – co-
authored by class participants – that describes the in-
dividual and shared molecular signatures of stress re-
sponses. Daphnia is used for training because of its
growing use as a model system for environmental ge-
nomics and for improving environmental health protec-
tion, yet the skills learned during the course will be
applicable to all study systems with mature genomics
resources.
Participants will also obtain hands-on training on the
latest automation protocols for higher-throughput pro-
cessing of next-generation sequencing samples, and will
learn computational methods to manage and analyze
genomics-scale data sets.
Ultimately, participants will be better positioned to
incorporate these technologies into their own research
laboratories, while better understanding how functional
genomics and automation can be applied to ecology,
evolution and toxicology.
The faculty at MDIBL is pleased to help advancethis new ﬁeld of research. Support for this training
course is provided by The Indiana University Center for
Genomics and Bioinformatics, Beckman Coulter Inc.,

Switzerland Speciation Aug29-Sep4
We announce an ESF-funded summer school “Methods
in Empirical Speciation Research”, taking place August
29 to September 4, 2010 in Switzerland. We still have
travel support and accommodation for additional par-
ticipants and consider applications until June 30th.
The school is part of the European Science Foundation
Networking Program Frontiers in Speciation Research
(FROSpects) and is open for PhD students, early stage
Postdocs and exceptionally well qualiﬁed MSc students.
Venue is the EAWAG Center of Ecology, Evolution
& Biogeochemistry (CEEB) in Kastanienbaum on the
shores of Alpine fjord Lake Lucerne.
Speciation research is currently one of the most vibrant
ﬁelds in evolutionary research. Its success became pos-
sible because of advances in empirical methods, con-
cepts and theory building in population genetics and
evolutionary ecology. We are now in the early stage
of yet another wave of advance, associated with the
genomics era. Studying speciation is a deeply inter-
disciplinary endeavor that often requires good under-
standing of very many diﬀerent concepts and methods
in ecology, genetics and evolution. This makes speci-
ation research sometimes more diﬃcult to access for
young scientists than more disciplinary research ques-
tions in ecology and evolution. In this summer school
we want to introduce graduate students to the ways
experienced and successful speciation researchers inte-
grate concepts and methods from ecology, genetics, ge-
nomics and behavioural biology in an attempt to elu-
cidate causes, mechanisms and consequences of, and
constraints to speciation.
The course, taught by an international team of estab-
lished speciation researchers, will provide state of the90 EvolDir July 1, 2010
art overviews of major topics, as well as ﬁrst hand in-
sights into speciﬁc issues. In four mornings Roger But-
lin (U Sheﬃeld), Scott Hodges (UC Santa Barbara),
Catherine Peichel (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Centre) and Glenn-Peter Saetre (CEES Oslo) will teach
empirical lecture modules. Latest developments in spe-
ciation theory will be taught in a ﬁfth lecture mod-
ule by Sander van Doorn (U Bern). In the afternoons
we will oﬀer workshops and excursions to speciation
study sites. These and a series of evening spotlight-
on-research lectures will be taught by Elena Conti
(U Z¨ urich), Martine Maan (U Bern, Eawag), Walter
Salzburger (U Basel), Ole Seehausen (U Bern, Eawag),
Arjun Sivasundar (U Bern), Piet Spaak (Eawag) and
Alex Widmer (ETHZ). The class size will not exceed 25
students and students will have ample opportunity to
interact with teachers and staﬀ througho ut the week.
We provide students with travel grants, free on-site ac-
commodation and meals.

UHawaii WaterAndEvolution
Jan3-17
Title: Astrobiology Winter School for GraduatesThe University of Hawaii branch of the NASA Astrobi-
ology Institute will host a winter school on the theme of
water and the evolution of life in the cosmos, from Mon-
day January 3rd to Monday January 17th 2011. This
school will provide approximately 40 post-graduate par-
ticipants with a broad but high-level introduction into
astrobiology, emphasizing the origin and role of water
in the emergence of life on our planet, and in the search
for life elsewhere. It will be truly multidisciplinary,
bringing together students and researchers from the di-
verse scientiﬁc backgrounds that contribute to our un-
derstanding here. Hawaii oﬀers ideal resources for this
training opportunity, from world-leading astronomical
observing facilities through state of the art cosmochem-
istry simulation equipment to unique geologic environ-
ments in which extremophile life exists. Applications
are invited from all graduate and post-doctoral students
whose research interests intersect with astrobiology.
For evoldir readers, the primary draw of this winter
school may be its emphasis on communicating the non-
biological context for the origin of life (i.e. the chem-
istry, geology and astronomy of relevance to astrobiol-
ogy)
Successful applicants will be funded for travel, ac-
commodation and all relevant costs (although we are
still ﬁguring out some new legislature which may
require us to charge a small paperwork processing
fee and tax for participants who are not U.S. citizens
- if you are interested in the opportunity, then we
encourage you to apply, and we can talk through
these details at the time of making an oﬀer!) Further

These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software ( http://www.ﬂywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm ). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a ’workshop’ feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.
The fee for the course is GBP 250.00 (I’m afraid it’s
gone up again from last year – this is out of my con-
trol).
All prospective participants need to pre-register for the
course. The deadline for this is the *10 September
2010*.

Field Course in Tropical Biology and Conservation
This course is an introduction to tropical forests dy-
namics and conservation designed for advanced under-
graduate and beginning graduate students.
Format: Course activities will be split between lecture
and ﬁeld exercises. Students will participate in on-going
experiments to establish long term monitoring eﬀorts.
Students will design independent projects. The course
concludes with a symposium, where students present
results of course activities and compete for the AFEC
best research award.
Where: The course convenes in Kunming (capital city
of Yunnan Province, China) after which we move to
Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden near the
Lao ?C Burma borders. The ﬁeld work will take place
in Mengsong near the Burma border, an area with a
variety of rice ﬁelds, tea plantations, secondary forests
and magniﬁcent primary forest.
Topics: Tropical Ecology, Eco-Physiology, Taxonomy,
Evolutionary Ecology, Plant and Animal Interactions,
Biodiversity, Conservation Biology, Invasive Species
and more!
Instructors: The various topics will be taught by pro-
fessors from several institutes including The Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Leiden University, Texas Tech
University, Netherlands Center for Biodiversity, Kun-
ming Institute of Zoology.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
