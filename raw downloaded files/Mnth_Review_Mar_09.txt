LIMITED TO 150 PEOPLE
PROGRAM: This conference will focus on the com-
putational and statistical challenges that pose NGS
data. While wet lab prices are steadily decreasing,
bioinformatic and statistical analyses have become a
serious bottleneck. We have broadly organized the
conference around two axes: technology and applica-
tions. The ﬁrst part will embrace bioinformatic, sta-
tistical and computational problems. The second will
raise some of the most emblematic areas where NGS
has exerted a dramatic inﬂuence.The conference is de-
signed to bring together keynote speakers, technolog-
ical representatives and active researchers in the ﬁeldso that they can interact in a warm and stimulating
atmosphere, and in a beautiful venue as is the early
XIX century building known as Casa Convalescencia in
Barcelona.
COMMUNICATIONS: Abstracts should be submitted
before July 3, some will be selected for oral presenta-
tion.
REGISTRATION: The cost is 300 and includes ad-
mission, abstract book, meals (noon), coﬀee breaks

Announcing a 2009 symposium on the biology of Anolis
lizards.
We at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Har-
vard University are pleased to announce a symposium
focused on the biology of Anolis lizards to be held here
at Harvard in Fall 2009. This weekend meeting follows
a long but sporadic tradition of informal Anolis-themed
gatherings dating back to the 1970s, and it is our honor
to invite you to join us to discuss anoles during the ﬁrst
weekend of October.
All details, including registration, transportation,
meeting schedule, and more may be found on the sym-
posium website:

First announcement of the
Resurrection Ecology Symposium in Herzberg, Switzer-
land, September 13-18, 2009.
www.resurrection-ecology.net This symposium aims to
gather together active researchers in ecology, evolution-
ary biology, paleolimnology, and paleoecological disci-
plines to 1) present results of investigations, 2) to fur-
ther deﬁne the emerging ﬁeld of “resurrection ecology”,
and 3) share techniques (as talks or posters).
Our invited speakers are:
John Colbourne Indiana University, USA Luc De
Meester Katholieke Universiteit, Belgium Nelson
Hairston Jr. Cornell University, USA Charles Kerfoot
Michigan Technological University, USA Peter R. Leav-
itt University of Regina, Canada Mathew Leibold Uni-
versity of Texas at Austin, USA Larry J. Weider Uni-
versity of Oklahoma, USA
Testing modern populations for evolutionary and eco-
logical properties has always involved a paradox. How
can one test responses that presumably occurred over
several past generations? Here we advocate an alterna-
tive, experimental approach, one that combines mod-
ern ecology with paleoecology. The practice of retriev-
ing viable propagule stages for assays opens up a new
ﬁeld and simultaneous experimental testing can: 1) al-
low experimental evaluation of alternative evolutionary
and ecological theories, 2) test paleoecological conjec-
tures, and 3) provide an “in situ” historical bioassay for
gauging the importance of ecosystem perturbations.
The Herzberg Conference site will provide a relaxing
venue, crafted to encourage an atmosphere for creative
ferment, synthesis, and lively debate.
Spread the word - pre-registration is open!
We look forward to meeting you, Nora Brede and Piet
Spaak, Eawag D¨ ubendorf, Switzerland

Leiden EvolutionPlantPollinator
Mar15
It has been conﬁrmed that the *Evolution of plant-
pollinator interactionssymposium proposed *in the
framework of systematics 2009 in Leiden (Netherlands:
http://www.biosyst.eu/ ) *was accepted*.
Several of you have already manifested their interest
(i) in taking part in that symposium, (ii) in presenting
a communication. This was very helpful as a support
of the proposal. It is now time to deﬁne the deﬁnitive
list of speakers and to give a backbone to the sympo-
sium. I would be delighted if the interested speakers
could ﬁrmly conﬁrm their participation in the sympo-
sium *before March 15th* and if they could prepare
*an abstract* of their contribution to the symposium
(~1,000 characters organized as a summary). The ab-
stracts would be welcome before *end of March*.
I think it is worth to underline, that I am now applying
to make the proceedings of this symposium published
in a book in the Cambridge University Press.
Finally, I wish to underline three last point: (i) the
present mail (basically the 3rd on the topic) is the last
general mailing, in the future only people having man-
ifested their interest will be further contacted; (ii) I
wish to tune broadly the symposium theme [i.e. ’Evolu-
tion of plant-pollinator interactions’], communications
*about all zoological/botanical groups* are welcome;
(iii) my list of contacts is of course limited, *feel freeto pass this message to potentially interested colleagues
(incl. students,...)*!
Yours, Seb
–
The pollinators are increasingly focusing the attention
of the scientiﬁc community. The pragmatic rationale
of that interest is inherent to the economical value of
pollination, estimated to 150+ billions /year. That in-
terest for pollination and pollinators is ampliﬁed by the
multiple observations of population regressions and di-
versity erosion, in many diﬀerent regions and habitats
around the World. The model for evolutionary biology
that represents the pollinator-host-plant relationships,
also contributes to catch the energy of many scientists.
In that context of increasing need for understanding
how pollinators interact with and within their ecologi-
cal web, insight in pollinators evolution are highly valu-
able.
In the last years, the setting up of large information sys-
tems (ecological databases, taxonomic websites, survey
programs,), the rise of the computational capacities (al-
lowing to bring together large amount of varied kinds of
information), even of individual computers and the easy
access to always larger parts of the species genomes,
provided bases for more comprehensive studies of the
pollination service and its evolutionary dimension.
The group-wide character mapping of the ﬂoral choices
patterns has provided strong insights concerning the
evolutionary relationships of pollinators and host
plants. Likewise, the opportunity of accurately dat-
ing the phylogenetic topologies has oﬀered an oppor-
tunity of understanding why some rapid specialisation
events occurred, while some other groups remained in-
defectibly generalist. In the micro-evolutionary scale,
textbook examples have been depicted in the molec-
ular co-evolution of Orchids and pollinators. Finally,
several studies, thanks to genome sequencing initiatives
or using alternative techniques, have characterized the
transcriptomes of pollinators and wide opened a door
on the ways in which pollinators perceive their environ-
ment.
In that context of need for improved information con-
cerning the pollinators and their relationships to envi-
ronments and of highly active scientiﬁc sphere produc-
ing very large amount of data, it sounds us useful to
set up a speciﬁc symposium, which will act as a forum
facilitating quality exchanges between authorities. –

e-Biosphere 09 Conference
The conference organizers have also created a se-
ries of electronic discussion forums under the um-
brella of the “Online Conference Community <http:/-
/forum.e-biosphere09.org/ >” (OCC; http://forum.e-
biosphere09.org/ ). The OCC oﬀers researchers and
users of Biodiversity Informatics the opportunity to in-
teract and prepare for the conference which will take
place in London on 1-3 June 2009.
The OCC has been divided into 14 subcommunities for
more focused discussions. These correspond to major
research topics related to Biodiversity Informatics and
its use by diﬀerent groups. One session of the con-
ference will be devoted to break-out discussion groups
which will correspond with these online subcommuni-
ties, giving the participants the opportunity to meet in
person to continue their interactions.
The conference organizers oﬀer two challenges to re-
searchers and users of Biodiversity Informatics. Sub-
communities will have the opportunity to submit
manuscripts that respond to these challenges for possi-ble publication in the Conference Proceedings Volume.
The challenges are:
1. Prepare a real-time demonstration for the three days
of the e-Biosphere 09 conference that shows how infor-
mation on new discoveries enters, propagates, and be-
comes interconnected with the rest of Biodiversity In-
formatics. For example, can a newly discovered species
be described, published, and documented worldwide
through a cascade of information through intercon-
nected databases, all in three days? 2. Prepare a Po-
sition Paper that describes the information resources,
database interoperability, and data analysis capabilities
that each subcommunity will need ﬁve to ten years from
now. For example, what new information resources
and informatics capabilities will agricultural researchers
need? What interoperability will they need concern-
ing plant biology, agricultural pests, pathogens, inva-
sive species, environmental factors, to name a few?
Questions concerning the e-Biosphere 09 Conference
can be sent to inquiries.e-biosphere09@si.edu.

Ancient lakes are well known as aquatic island systems
with high alpha and beta species diversity. Molluscs,
especially gastropods, have formed a number of diverseMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 11
endemic radiations in these systems. Ecological con-
text is critical in both mechanisms of divergence and
co-existence. This symposium will bring together spe-
cialists who have approached the ecology and evolution
of molluscan species ﬂocks in several ancient lake sys-
tems and using a range of methods. The speakers will
cover many of the big topics in ecology for these sys-
tems: food, babies, parasites, deep time, communities
and conservation. This symposium will be relevant to
all with an interest in mechanisms of diversiﬁcation in
species-rich groups in island systems or in benthic ecol-

Turin ESEB ParasiteEvolution
Aug24-29
We are inviting abstract submissions for oral and poster
presentations in the symposium “Integrating ecology
with parasite evolution” to be held on August 28
2009 at the European Society for Evolutionary Bi-
ology(ESEB) meeting in Turin, Italy (August 24-29
2009).
Abstracts should be submitted online at http://-
www.eseb2009.it/uk/by February 15 2009.
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPOSIUM: The enormous
abundance of parasites and their eﬀects on wild pop-
ulations, agriculture and human health have given rise
to a rapidly growing ﬁeld centered on using evolution-14 EvolDir March 1, 2009
ary principles to understand infectious disease. This
ﬁeld does not only signiﬁcantly contribute to our gen-
eral understanding of evolutionary theory, but also has
the potential to provide new ways of tackling disease.
The last few decades have seen much progress in un-
derstanding general evolutionary processes in parasite
biology, and have also revealed the important role of
genetic interactions between hosts and parasites. How-
ever, much less attention has been paid to the eﬀect of
the ecological conditions under which hosts and para-
sites interact. This is a serious problem, because em-
pirical studies are increasingly showing that in-host and
external environmental factors (e.g. temperature, host
diet and the presence of competitors) can shape para-
site virulence, life-histories, within-host dynamics and
transmission. The aim of this symposium is to bring
together theoreticians and empiricists to explore how
ecology inﬂuences the evolution of parasites. This will
not only advance understanding of the basic processes
by which parasites evolve, but also provide a basis to
predict the consequences of human interventions on in-
fectious disease.

/www.eseb2009.it/uk Ecological consequences of poly-
ploidy in plants and animals
Polyploids (individuals with more than two genomes)
are common in many groups of organisms, including
plants, amphibians, ﬁsh, reptiles and crustaceans. In
addition, recent genome analyses indicate that many
extant diploids have a polyploid history. The potency
of genome duplications to drive evolution can be ex-
plained by the mere fact that polyploids inherently con-
tain more (redundant) genetic material for selection to
work on than diploids.
Research on polyploids has been strongly biased to-
wards plants, and has tended to focus on genomic
questions concerning diﬀerences in gene expression and
epigenetics between diploids and polyploids. Unfortu-
nately, such studies are limited to model organisms with
a well known genome, and often to a limited number of
samples within these. An ecological approach is more
universally applicable, and may therefore provide more
insights into the diﬀerences and similarities of polyploid
evolution in a wide range of organisms.
With our symposium, we would like to oﬀer the ESEB
community a platform to discuss what is known about
the eﬀects of polyploidy on ecological adaptation. To
achieve this, we intend to bring together researchers
that work on polyploidy in diﬀerent groups, including
(but hopefully not limited to) plants, ﬁshes, amphib-
ians, planarians and crustaceans.March 1, 2009 EvolDir 15

Abstracts
REMINDER: SPECIATION symposium ESEB 2009
Abstract submission: 3 days left (deadline: 15 February
2009)
We invite abstract submissions for oral and poster
presentations in the symposium “Frontiers in Specia-
tion Research: proximal and causal mechanisms of be-
havioural divergence” to be held on August 28 2009 at
the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
meeting in Turin, Italy (August 24-29 2009).
This symposium is supported by the European Net-
working Programme on Frontiers in Speciation Re-
search (FroSpects) coordinated by the European Sci-
ence Foundation (ESF).
Abstracts should be submitted online at http://-
www.eseb2009.it/uk/ by February 15 2009. Unfortu-
nately, we cannot oﬀer any ﬁnancial support.
Description of the symposium: Three-quarter day sym-
posium, on the 28th of August 2009 150 years after the
publication of Darwin’s seminal work ’On the Origin of
Species’, how new species arise remains an unresolved
and fascinating riddle. The aim of this symposium is to
cover new challenges in speciation research, addressing
in particular the evolution of behavioural divergence in-
volved in reproductive isolation. It will bring together
researchers working on diﬀerent types of behaviour in-
volved in premating isolation (e.g. mate choice, habi-
tat choice, pollinator choice) and developing various
approaches (e.g. behavioural ecology, neurophysiol-
ogy, genomics) to explore the mechanisms favouring
behavioural divergence and reproduction isolation. A
key point of this symposium will be to illustrate the
more integrated view of behavioural divergence that is
nowadays emerging, which combines consideration of
the causal with the proximal mechanisms of receiver
and/or signal divergence. Particular attention will begiven to studies addressing the genomics of behavioural
divergence, the role of non-genetic mechanisms in pro-
moting the evolution of premating isolation (cultural
transmission, imprinting, epigenetics etc.) and the neu-
rophysiological basis of behavioural divergence.

*** Deadline Sunday, 15 Feb 2009 ***
We are inviting abstract submissions for oral and poster
presentations for the symposium “Evolutionary sys-
tems biology”, to be held for 3/4 of a day on August 25
2009 at the European Society for Evolutionary Biology
(ESEB) meeting in Turin, Italy (August 24-29 2009).
Abstracts must be submitted online at http://-
www.eseb2009.it/uk/ by 15 February 2009 latest.
Our symposium is aimed at researchers with an interest
in bridging the genotype-phenotype gap with mechanis-
tic models. These models may quantify aspects of any
level of the adaptive landscape with a view towards con-
necting empirical evidence from diﬀerent levels. This
can be done using theoretic, computational, genomic,
experimental, systems biology or other approaches and
might target anything from very speciﬁc molecular sys-tems to whole organisms.
Conﬁrmed invited speakers: Laurence Hurst, Univer-
sity of Bath, UK Roy Kishony, Harvard University,

About evolutionary systems biology
Evolutionary genetics has a long history of successful
quantitative modelling, especially in areas where func-
tional details can be abstracted by selection coeﬃcients.
Molecular biology has a long history of uncovering func-
tional details and has recently started to engage in
quantitative modelling at a larger scale, giving rise to
current systems biology. We propose to bring these
two ﬁelds together to help elucidate some fundamental
problems in evolutionary biology. Such a synthesis has
the potential to provide a mechanistic basis for in silico
predictions of many important parameters of evolution,
including distributions of mutational eﬀects, robustness
and epistasis. Central to this approach is the deﬁnition
of ﬁtness correlates that can be computed using mecha-
nistic models of individuals. One possible aim for mod-
elling in evolutionary systems biology could be to deﬁne
computable ﬁtness correlates that can be calibrated ex-
perimentally by measuring mutant properties.
This ambitious goal can inspire experimental and the-
oretical work at many levels of the adaptive landscape.
These levels include: 1. Changes in genotypes im-
pact predicted molecular structures (like protein struc-
tures). 2. Changes in molecular structures impact pre-
dicted molecular functions (like enzyme reaction rates).
3. Changes in molecular functions impact predicted
properties of reaction networks (see systems biology).
4. Changes in reaction network properties impact pre-
dicted ﬁtness correlates (need to be deﬁned for each
model). How ﬁtness correlates are mapped to ﬁtness
is deﬁned at even higher levels (see life-history evolu-
tion). All levels ultimately need to be brought together
to facilitate computational predictions of realistic mu-
tational eﬀects, robustness, epistasis and adaptive evo-
lution.
In this symposium we aim to bring together researchers
with an interest in the adaptive landscape at any level
and researchers who want to contribute towards a syn-
thesis of evolutionary genetics with mechanistic mod-
els of life. We believe that the new excitement in sys-
tems biology is an excellent opportunity for progress inMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 17
many fundamental evolutionary questions, if the new
models that are being constructed can be extended to
include ﬁtness correlates that turn them into powerful
tools for investigating the adaptive landscape. We also
expect systems biology to beneﬁt from including the
rich quantitative approaches that have been developed
within evolutionary genetics.

Childcare and Mentoring Programs at Evolution 2009,
12-17 June 2009, Moscow ID, USA With a re-
cent grant from the Elsevier New Scholars Pro-
gram http://www.elsevierfoundation.org/scholar.html,
we are launching childcare services to parents who will
be attending the Evolution conference and a new men-
toring program available to all members of SSB, SSE
and ASN. We have received funding to support these
new programs for the Evolution conferences from 2009
to 2011, and both will be available options on the
Evolution 2009 online registration site. We encour-
age all members to take advantage of these opportu-
nities, which are detailed below. If you have any ques-
tions about either of these two programs, please contact
Leah Larkin (llarkin@paciﬁc.edu) or Heidi Meudt (hei-
dim@tepapa.govt.nz). Childcare. Professional child-
care services will be available on-site at the confer-
ence. Attendees who wish to use the childcare ser-
vices should sign up on the online meeting registra-
tion form indicating the number of children and their
ages. Childcare will be available from 8-5 pm on each
day of the conference; options will also be available for
evening events. Please indicate your interest in the on-
line registration form, and we will contact you regard-
ing prices and details. A subsidy is available to help
oﬀset the cost of childcare services at the conference
for a limited number of graduate students, postdocs
and early-career parents. Please indicate your inter-
est in applying for the subsidy, which will be allocated
on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis. Evolution Mentor-
ing Program. We are launching a FREE tri-society
mentoring program through MentorNet. MentorNet is
an award-winning mentoring organization that matches
mentors with compatible prot´ eg´ es for an eight-month
pairing, which includes weekly or biweekly e-mail dis-
cussion prompts to foster supportive mentoring rela-
tionships. When you create a proﬁle in MentorNet’s
system and specify that you are a member of the Evo-
lution Mentoring Program, their proprietary software
will recommend suitable matches between established
scientist mentors and early-career prot´ eg´ es (including18 EvolDir March 1, 2009
graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and assis-
tant professors) from SSB, ASN, and SSE. Paired men-
tors and prot´ eg´ es will have the opportunity to meet one
another (and other participants) at a tri-society sym-
posium luncheon at the conference as they begin their
eight-month pairing. If you are a member of SSB, ASN
or SSE and are interested in participating in this FREE
tri-society mentoring pro gram as either a mentor or
a prot´ eg´ e, you can establish a proﬁle from a Mentor-
Net link on the Evolution meeting website indicating
your experience and academic interests. To ensure that
matches are made within the three societies, be sure
to specify “Evolution Mentoring” as a requirement in
your preferences. Interested mentors may sign up here
(www.MentorNet.net/mentor ), and interested prot´ eg´ es

UIdaho SSE rafting opportunity
At the end of the upcoming 2009 Evolution meetings at
University of Idaho, there will be several ﬁeldtrips. In
addition to the ones posted on the meeting website, a
professional rafting company is launching a 2-day raft-
ing trip right after the meetings. The setup is described
below; note that you will need to register directly with
the rafting company.
The Salmon River oﬀers some of the best rafting in the
world. Travelling the canyon of this river, also known
as the River of No Return, you will not only experience
the tempers of glorious whitewater, but experience the
second deepest canyon in North America. The timing
of the trip will permit some spectacular birding oppor-
tunities (golden eagles, Lewis’ woodpeckers, etc.), and
there may be a chinook salmon ﬁshery open. This is a
2-day trip, with early departure from Moscow on June
17, and return in the evening of June 18. You will spend
the night camping on one of the many sandy beaches
along the river.
The trip is tailored for meeting participants by Wapiti
River Guides, and raft capacity is limited to twelve peo-
ple, so register early. The cost is $299, and it is paid
directly to Wapiti. To reserve your spot, contact them
at 1-800-488-9872 and let them know that you will at-tend the Evolution meetings. You will be asked to pay
25% down when you register. We will arrange trans-
portation from Moscow to the river in Riggins; the cost
is unknown at this time.

OriginOfSpecies
Hi everybody,
First of all, Happy Darwin Anniversary! Secondly, this
is an invitation to participate in a symposium on the
origin of species at SMBE 2009 (Iowa City June 3-7):
“Genomics of Speciation & Recent Divergences”Symposium description: With the recent availability of
full genome sequences in several pairs of closely related
species, we are now at a stage where a genome-wide pic-
ture of species divergence is within reach. These new
data are complemented by theory on the role of recom-
bination in the divergence process and by statistical
methods assessing gene ﬂow during divergence. Recent
studies have clearly shown that speciation history may
be complex and that the genomes of incipient species di-
verge at strikingly heterogeneous rates. Although much
of this heterogeneity may be accounted for by stochas-
ticity of the genetic drift process, the role of natural se-
lection in promoting or preventing genomic divergence
between nascent species remains highly debated. For
example, can genomic regions experiencing reduced in-
trogression act as3genomic islands of speciation2, im-
peding gene ﬂow of linked regions and thereby increase
intergenomic divergence and drive reproductive isola-
tion? In particular, while genomic co-adaptations de-
veloping independently in each species are believed to
select against the transfer of genetic material from one
species into the genomic background of the other, other
forces such as balancing selection may actually favor in-
trogression. This symposium will present the depth of
scholarship and the variety of evolutionary processes
involved in genomic divergence by conveying top re-
searchers actively involved in studies on a wide range
of organisms. We anticipate that it will be a nice op-
portunity to bring together genomicists for a ﬁne-scale
description of the heterogeneity of divergence across the
genome with population geneticists for more precise,
hypothesis-driven studies on candidate genes.
Invited speakers list is not yet ﬁnalized. There will be
six 15 min slots available for contributed talks. The
deadline for abstract submission for contributed talks
is April 1st. Poster presentations are also welcome!

DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICA-
TIONS/NOMINATIONS: March 16th, 2009
Program outline
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) is pleased to make available 10 awards for
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups
to participate in a Diversity Mentoring Program. The
goals of this program are: (1) to promote diversity at
the SMBE annual meeting, (2) to provide students withMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 21
the opportunity to experience the excitement of attend-
ing and presenting at an international scientiﬁc confer-
ence, and (3) to foster enthusiasm for molecular biology
and evolution as well as a possible career in this ﬁeld.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Diversity Mentoring Program Award will
be paired with two mentors, one a senior graduate stu-
dent and the other a postdoctoral fellow or faculty
member (who may or may not be the student’s current
advisor).
Speciﬁc mentoring activities will include:
* Attending conference sessions with the student, an-
swering questions about the basic concepts being pre-
sented, and, more generally, explaining the ’goings-on’
at a multi-day scientiﬁc conference. * Interacting with
the student during some mealtimes, coﬀee breaks and
other social gatherings. * Introducing the student to
other undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows and faculty members as a way of facilitating
connections with potential future graduate supervisors
and colleagues. * Attending the poster session and
SBME Undergraduate Diversity Program Award recep-
tion with the student in order to minimize/ overcome
the anxiety often felt by ﬁrst-time conference attendees.
* Serving as a contact point for the student to help
resolve any issues surrounding conference registration,
travel and accommodation.
Eligibility
Candidates must currently be enrolled as undergradu-
ate students (Bachelor’s level degree) or have graduated
within the last six (6) months at the time of application
and be from groups underrepresented in our scientiﬁc
discipline.
Meeting Participation
Recipients of an SMBE Undergraduate Diversity Men-
toring Program Award will be invited to present their
research at a special reception/poster session attended
by their mentors, supervisors and other interested con-
ference participants.
Award
10 awards will be given. Award recipients will receive
a travel award to cover the cost of airfare, accommo-
dation, and registration expenses. The travel award
amount will not exceed $1,000 for within- USA contes-
tants and $1,500 for all other contestants. Each par-
ticipant will also receive online student access to the
Society journal, Molecular Biology and Evolution.
Application
1. Faculty members may nominate undergraduatesby sending a brief letter/email of recommendation to
John Archibald (john.archibald[at]dal.ca). The letter

REPRODUCTIVE PROTEIN FUNCTION AND
EVOLUTION at SMBE Congress Iowa City, June 3-
7, 2009
Dear colleagues,
We would like to invite interested people to submit ab-
stracts for oral and poster presentations for the sym-
posium “REPRODUCTIVE PROTEIN FUNCTION
AND EVOLUTION”, which will take place at the next
Congress of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evo-
lution in Iowa city, IA, United States (3-7 June 2009).
Abstract Submission Deadline: April 1st
Description: Reproductive proteins are responsible for
traits inﬂuencing reproductive success and contribut-
ing to reproductive isolation of animal and plant species
by regulating essential processes that fundamentally in-
ﬂuence ﬁtness. Speciﬁc genes acting at several stages
of reproduction have been recently identiﬁed in diﬀer-
ent organisms, including genes involved in the regula-22 EvolDir March 1, 2009
tion of the interaction among male and female gametes
as well as genes encoding sperm nuclear basic proteins
(SNBPs) involved in DNA packaging in the sperm nu-
cleus. Research on reproductive proteins has also bene-
ﬁtted from advances in genomics and proteomics, which
have allowed the identiﬁcation and evolutionary analy-
sis of entire suites of these proteins in both model and
non-model systems. The understanding of the struc-
ture, role, tempo and mode of evolution of reproductive
proteins has been a major issue in evolutionary biology
and molecular evolution during the last ﬁve years, lead-
ing to the discovery that reproductive proteins evolve
more rapidly than other genes, frequently as the result
of adaptive evolution. The large amount of work pub-
lished in recent years on this topic constitutes a perfect
venue for the comprehensive review of diﬀerent points of
view, experimental approaches, and theoretical studies
on the evolutionary biology of these proteins. We think
this topic would represent a very interesting update in
the evolution of a group of proteins that bears criti-
cal interest not only to people involved in reproduction
research, but to a broad audience who should be able
to enjoy the presentation of the recent state-of-the-art
research in this ﬁeld.

JUNE 3-7, Iowa City, IA
CONFERENCE WEBSITE
http://ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/smbe/index.php Pro-
gram outline
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) is oﬀering 10 awards to undergraduate stu-
dents from underrepresented groups to participate in
a Diversity Mentoring Program. The goals of this pro-
gram are: (1) to promote diversity at the SMBE annual
meeting, (2) to provide students with the opportunity
to experience the excitement of attending and present-
ing at an international scientiﬁc conference, and (3) to
foster enthusiasm for molecular biology and evolution
as well as a possible career in this ﬁeld.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Diversity Mentoring Program Award will
be paired with two mentors, one a senior graduate stu-
dent and the other a postdoctoral fellow or faculty
member (who may or may not be the students current
advisor).
WE ARE SEEKING INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED
IN BEING A MENTOR. Speciﬁc activities will include:
* Attending conference sessions with the student, an-
swering questions about the basic concepts being pre-
sented, and, more generally, explaining the ’goings-on’
at a multi-day scientiﬁc conference. * Interacting with
the student during some mealtimes, coﬀee breaks and
other social gatherings. * Introducing the student to
other undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows and faculty members as a way of facilitating
connections with potential future graduate supervisors
and colleagues. * Attending the poster session and
SBME Undergraduate Diversity Program Award recep-
tion with the student in order to minimize/overcome
the anxiety often felt by ﬁrst-time conference atten-
dees. * Serving as a contact point for the student to
help resolve any issues surrounding conference registra-
tion, travel and accommodation.March 1, 2009 EvolDir 23

SAGE2009 Conference - “Southeast Asian Gateway
Evolution”
14-17 September 2009: Royal Holloway University of
London
http://sage2009.rhul.ac.uk The Southeast Asian Gate-
way is the site of the Indonesian Throughﬂow between
the Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans. It is the only low lati-
tude link between the worlds oceans, and is increasingly
regarded as an important inﬂuence on global climate.
The throughﬂow passes through the present zone of col-
lision between Australia and SE Asia. The collision be-
gan about 25 million years ago, but SE Asia has a longhistory of growth by the addition of continental frag-
ments rifted from Gondwana dating back to the Palaeo-
zoic. The fauna and ﬂora display a similar complexity
which is partly linked to the geology.
There is a centre of maximum diversity in the ma-
rine and terrestrial ecosystems in the Indo-Australian
archipelago, and the gateway contains numerous bio-
geographic boundaries. The centre of the region, known
to biologists as Wallacea after Alfred Russel Wallace of
Wallaces Line, is an unusual region of high faunal and
ﬂoral endemicity. Plate tectonic reconstructions sug-
gest that geology has played a major role in shaping
the distributions of biota and the tectonic development
of the region is one key to understanding the links be-
tween oceanic circulation, climate and life. However,
these links are not well documented and connections
between diﬀerent processes are uncertain. Understand-
ing the geological and biological history of the region,
and the evolution of biodiversity, is of considerable im-
portance in managing current and future change.
This will be a three-day multidisciplinary meeting to
discuss this important region with an emphasis on re-
porting new ideas and exchanging views between a wide
range of Earth and Life Scientists. It will promote in-
teraction between Earth and Life Scientists working in
the region. The programme will include plenary ses-
sions, overview presentations, and breakouts for spe-
cialist groups. We seek contributions on all geological
and biological aspects of the Southeast Asian Gateway,
the region including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philip-
pines, Indochina, New Guinea and the NW Shelf of
Australia.
Details of keynote speakers, accommodation, registra-
tion, pre and post conference ﬁeld trips, abstract sub-
mission and important dates are available at: http://-
sage2009.rhul.ac.uk/ Abstracts of not more than 400
words should be submitted by 31st March 2009.
****NOTE**** A limited amount of funding (up to
£500) will be made available to one individual from
each of the following categories to allow them to attend
the meeting and present either a poster or talk:
one student based in SE Asia and working on molluscs
one researcher based in SEA Asia early career or stu-
dent researchers
After submitting an abstract, please apply for funding
via email to sage2009@nhm.ac.uk . Letters of applica-
tion should be no longer than 1 side A4 and include a
brief biological sketch and summary of current research
projects. Students should include a letter of recommen-
dation from a supervisor.

University
The Angelini Lab is currently seeking qualiﬁed and in-
terested applicants for the AU Biology Masters pro-
gram. This is a competitive program oﬀering funding
opportunities during the academic year, summers, and
travel. Successful applicants will complete a course of
study and conduct independent research.
The lab is broadly interested in the developmental and
molecular genetic aspects of morphological evolution
(e.g. “evo-devo”). Using a combination of develop-
mental genetic and phylogenetic methods, we seek to
understand the interactions and functions of genes and
their networks in terms of the evolutionary histories
that have led to animal diversity. Insects and other
arthropods have been our study organisms.
American University is located in Washington, DC,
and aﬀords students unparalleled access to world-class
research institutions, prestigious internship opportuni-
ties, and memorable learning experiences outside of the
classroom.
Applicants should have completed a bachelor1s degree
in the biological sciences, and have an interest in ge-
netics and evolution. Applications to the Biology De-
partment for 2009 will be considered on a rolling basis.
GRE scores are required, and the Biology or Biochem-
istry, Cell and Molecular Biology subject test are en-
couraged but not required.

The Experimental Ecology Group (Prof. Paul Schmid-
Hempel) is seeking to ﬁll a Ph.D. Position28 EvolDir March 1, 2009
(Genetics and speciﬁcity of host-parasite interactions)
to work on questions of speciﬁcity in host-parasite in-
teractions using Bombus spp. and their parasites (pro-
tozoa) as the study system. The framework for this
study is given by the extreme level of speciﬁcity in
the interaction of Crithidia and Bombus in experimen-
tal and natural populations of various Bombus species.
The questions are the possible involvement of speciﬁc
vs. general immune defences, transmission pathways,
strong selection by the host, and how genotypic varia-
tion in parasite population is maintained. The project
will involve ﬁeld sampling, genetic typing with molecu-

Exeter SexualSelection
A PhD position at the University of Exeter. Dr David
Hosken & Dr John Hunt are seeking a motivated stu-
dent to work on sexual selection.Project details: Female mate-choice is responsible for
the evolution of some of the most spectacular male
characters. One leading explanations for why mate
choice evolves is that females preferentially mate with
male possessing good genes to gain genetic beneﬁts for
their oﬀspring. However, because females cannot di-
rectly assess male genes, they must rely on phenotypic
traits that signal a male$B!G(Bs genetic quality: that
is, phenotype must reliably map onto genotype. The
problem is that the genotype-phenotype relationship is
environment-dependent, so that whenever the environ-
ment ﬂuctuates and genotype-by-environment interac-
tions exist, females may no longer be able to gain reli-
able information about male quality. This project will
examine the consequences of a ﬂuctuating environment
on the evolution of female mate choice and the male
sexual trait(s) it targets.
Closing date for applications is the 12th of March
2009, with start date October 2009 (at the lat-
est). For more information contact Dr Hosken

ExeterU CricketSpeciation
PhD Studentship available October 2009. Exeter Uni-
versity.
Behavioural and genomic studies of sexual selection and
reproductive isolation in wild ﬁeld crickets.
To address the question of what drives speciation we
need to identify the factors causing divergence between
natural populations. Our recent work provides the op-
portunity to develop ﬁeld crickets as a model system
for such a study, utilizing next-generation sequencing
and behavioural studies to identify the genetic basis of
divergence. This project will involve ﬁeld collections
of crickets, molecular genetic work to establish phylo-
geographic relationships of populations and behavioural
experiments to establish patterns of phenotypic diver-
gence and premating and postmating isolation between
populations of the ﬁeld cricket Gryllus campestris. ThisMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 29
will allow the student to test predictions from existing
hypotheses for the evolution of reproductive isolation,
and to examine the genetic basis of behaviour in wild
insects.
During the last ice-age ﬁeld crickets (and other animals
and plants) were conﬁned to refugia in the South of
Europe, but the ancestry of current populations is un-
known. The student will use molecular genetics to re-
construct the post-glacial history of this species and the
relationships between extant populations. Wild popu-
lations will be collected from mainland Europe, reared
in ﬁeld enclosures in Spain and used in mate choice
and oﬀspring viability experiments to measure the de-
gree of pre-mating and post-mating reproductive iso-
lation between populations. Combined with measures
of phenotypic divergence, this will allow the student to
test competing hypothesis for the origin of reproductive
isolation; e.g. are populations that are simply more ge-
netically divergent most reproductively isolated, or is
environmental adaptation more important? What are
the contributions of pre-mating vs post-mating mecha-
nisms of reproductive isolation?

Tregenza (T.Tregenza@exeter.ac.uk) To apply please

Frankfurt SpongeEvolution
Frankfurt am Main, Germany: Research Associate
(PhD) position in taxonomy, phylogeography and evo-
lution of Antarctic sponges.
We invite applications for a research associate (PhD)
position in a project funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG) ˆ aPhylogeny of selected key taxa
of Antarctic deep-sea Porifera (Sponges) and the his-
tory of their radiation.ˆ a in the DFG Priority Program
SPP1158: “Antarctic Research in comparison with Arc-
tic Ice regions”. The project is located in the depart-
ment Marine Zoology of Senckenberg Forschungsinsti-
tut und Naturmuseum.
Sponges play an important ecological role as active ﬁl-
ter feeders and contribute signiﬁcantly to the ﬂow of
nutrients and pelago-benthic coupling, particularly no-
table for the extraordinary rich sponge populations ofthe Antarctic shelf. However, an unexpectedly high
diversity and abundance of Porifera was found in the
Antarctic dee-sea, partly exceeding those of the shelf,
but nothing is known yet about the colonization his-
tory, evolution or phylogenetic relationships of South-
ern Ocean sponge communities. In this project, we
aim to resolve the systematic and phylogenetic rela-
tionships of selected Antarctic sponge taxa and recon-
struct their phylogeographic history in comparison with
the sponge faunas of other World oceans, mainly the
Arctic. We use an integrative approach that combines
molecular techniques with morphological and palaeon-
tological data to achieve an understanding of the coloni-
sation and the history of diversiﬁcation of Antarctic
Porifera, pivotal to assess the potential of these fragile
communities for their resilience to global change. This
project is carried out in close collaboration with Prof.
Dr. Gert W¨ orheide, GeoBioCenterLMU of the Ludwig-
Maximilians-Universit¨ at (LMU) M¨ unchen.
We are seeking a highly motivated applicant with in-
terest and experience in taxonomy, phylogeny and
zoogeography of marine animals demonstrated by
an above-average MSc (or equivalent, e.g. German
diploma) degree in zoology or a related ﬁeld. Appli-
cants from abroad are encouraged to apply. The suc-
cessful candidate will join a well established working
group with access to valuable invertebrate collections,
well-equipped lab and library. Our Focus is biodiversity
of marine animals, and our research includes morpho-
logically based taxonomy and phylogeny in compari-
son with results from molecular investigations. Also
food web analysis by means of stable isotopes will be
part of this project. Participation in marine expedi-
tions may be required. More information about our
department and current research projects can be found
atwww.senckenberg.de (Research: Departments: Ma-
rine Zoology: Marine Evertebrates I). Requirements:
Degree in Biology (MA, MSc, or equivalent degree) or
related ﬁeld; very good and demonstrated knowledge
in methodology of morphological-taxonomic investiga-
tions and in phylogeny and zoogeography of marine an-
imals, including computer programs for such analyses;
excellent English language skills.
The position is initially available for 24 months (start-
ing by the 1.04.2009, or as soon as possible), with pos-
sible extension depending upon performance and avail-
ability of funding. It will be paid according to the Ger-
man TV salary scheme BAT 2a/2 (TV-L E13/2).

PHD SCHOLARSHIP AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE
LONDON
Project: European birds as a model system for predict-
ing epidemiology of epizootic disease
Supervisor: Prof Ian Owens, Department of Life Sci-
ences
ProjectThe Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Im-
perial College London is funding a series of PhD stu-
dentships in climate-related research ranging from un-
derstanding the likelihood of sudden, catastrophic cli-
mate events to the impact on disease within ecosys-
tems. One of these studentships is to test the eﬀect that
changes in migration routes may have on the spread of
disease, using European birds as a model system. The
student will make extensive use of GIS databases and
analyses and will be mainly based in the Ecology and
Evolution Group at Imperial College’s Silwood Park
Campus, which is approximately 20 miles South West
of London, but would also have strong links to other re-
search groups interested in climate change and disease.
Silwood Park has a very strong reputation for research
in ecology and evolution and is home to a large group of
researchers, including approximately 200 postgraduate
students.
The speciﬁc aims of the project will be to:
1. Digitally map the migratory routes of European
birds.
2. Construct environmental models of migratory distri-
butions.
3. Use climate models to predict changes in migratory
routes.
4. Predict the eﬀect of climate change on bird-borne
disease.
The project would suit either a biologist interested in
the eﬀects of climate change or a physical scientist wish-
ing to move into the climate impacts research area.
Links to the relevant climate expertise are available
through the Grantham Institute.

InstZool London FrogPopulations
Are humans spreading a virulent wildlife disease be-
tween British frog populations?
The common frog, Rana temporaria, has been experi-
encing mass die-oﬀs in the UK due to an invasion into
country of ranavirus FV35. Our partner, Froglife and
the CASE partner, the Institute of Zoology (IoZ) have
been tracking the pattern of these unusual frog mortal-
ities since 1992. The virus appears to have spread from
the ﬁrst infections in the southeast of England into the
southwest, North and Wales.
The student will examine this data for disease sparks
that are due to human activity, such as moving
frogspawn or ornamental ﬁsh. The student will then
map the distribution of viral genotypes, to challenge
these preliminary interpretations.
The IoZ will provide training in the ﬁrst year in the
isolation and characterisation of the virus. The student
will conduct ﬁeldwork in the summers of the ﬁrst two
years, and obtain samples in the key locations through-
out the disease range. There will be regular (monthly)
visits to FrogLifes base in Peterborough, and with the
local partner at Imperial in London.
A background in genetics, epidemiology or mathemati-
cal biology would be an advantage, but enthusiasm for
the project is the essential requirement. A driving li-
cense will be a great advantage. Diplomacy and skill in
dealing with pond owners will be essential.

Project title: Allelic variation and protein function in
a plant community context
Project description: This interdisciplinary project rep-
resents a collaboration between the Section of Plant
Ecology and Systematics, and the Section of Microbial
Ecology within the Department of Ecology, Lund Uni-
versity.
The project will focus on genomic ecology and commu-
nity genomics and will develop a novel system for the
study of gene variation and function in the context of
natural plant communities. Molecular diﬀerentiation
will be investigated at a pair of loci coding for a key
metabolic enzyme, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), in
the wild plant Festuca ovina, and the distribution and
function of individual PGI alleles will be explored in
natural populations within grassland plant communi-
ties on the Baltic island of Uland. The project will
involve characterization of sequence diﬀerentiation be-
tween the multiple alleles at the two loci and the de-
velopment of allele-speciﬁc primers. Relationships be-
tween individual alleles and ﬁne-scale niche-variation
within natural grassland communities will be investi-March 1, 2009 EvolDir 33
gated and the functional consequences of the allelic
variation will be inferred through analyses of predicted
protein structures.
The PhD project will be linked to the Research School
in Genomic Ecology within the Centre for Genomic
Ecology (CGE). Genomic ecology represents a new in-
terdisciplinary ﬁeld on the interface between ecology,
evolutionary and molecular biology, and genomics. The
long-term goal of CGE is to achieve an integrated un-
derstanding of the molecular, evolutionary and ecolog-
ical mechanisms and processes that are involved in the
generation of the immense diversity of form and func-
tion that characterizes living organisms. The Research
School in Genomic Ecology will provide the PhD stu-
dent with access to advanced courses and opportuni-
ties for placements in other laboratories as well as a
stimulating social network. Further information about
CGE and the research school can be found at http:/-

Of large and small ﬁsh: testing ecological speciation in
Lake Tanganyika cichlids
We seek a highly motivated and productive PhD stu-
dent to work on a research project on ecological speci-
ation in Lake Tanganyika cichlids. The importance of
natural selection is increasingly emphasized in studies
of speciation. The cichlids of the East African Great
Lakes are among the most spectacular examples of
rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. Surprisingly,
the role of ecological speciation in the evolution of these
ﬁsh faunas remains largely untested.
The aim of the PhD project is to test for ecological spe-
ciation within a candidate model system of ecological
speciation from Lake Tanganyika using population ge-
netic data (AFLPs), and by measuring ecological and
mating preferences under aquarium conditions.
The successful candidate for this project will have
to compete with two other candidates from diﬀerent
projects for a full-time NHM PhD studentship.
Applicants should have a Masters or equivalent research
experience in molecular ecology, behavioural ecology or
related ﬁelds as well as broad interest in systematics
and evolution. They should be able to work on com-
plex and demanding projects and enthusiastic about
participating in extensive ﬁeldwork in Africa.
The successful candidate will be supervised by
Dr Lukas R1ber (The Natural History Museum;
l.ruber@nhm.ac.uk) and Dr Martin J. Genner (Univer-34 EvolDir March 1, 2009

Synposis: There is great value in applying principles
of evolutionary biology to the study of cancer. It can
explain the high prevalence of cancer in humans and
why cancer genes are often positively favoured by se-
lection. For example, genes with beneﬁcial eﬀects early
in life can be strongly favoured, even if the cost in
later life is cancer. Conﬂicts of interest, for example
between males and females, may also be an impor-
tant source for increased cancer risk. We have recently
shown that the experimental application of increased38 EvolDir March 1, 2009
mating stress results in disregulation in reproductive
hormone signalling and microRNA biosynthesis genes.
These changes were associated with signiﬁcantly in-
creased death rate and are potentially signiﬁcant in the
context of cancer. In this proposal we aim to build upon
this work, to understand (i) whether microRNAs them-
selves are diﬀerentially expressed in response to mating
conﬂict and (ii) the mechanistic basis of how changes
in gene expression (and gene translation controlled by
microRNAs) leads to loss of organismal integrity and in-
creased death rate. The research is important because
of the need to understand the fundamental principles of
how evolution acts on genes that increase cancer risk.

UEdinburgh QuantGenet
Ph.D. Studentship at The Roslin Institute (University
of Edinburgh)
We are currently recruiting a Ph.D. student to eval-
uate and apply novel techniques for diversity-based
gene mapping in livestock species. This four-year stu-
dentship is funded by a Genesis Faraday CASE BBSRC
award with an enhanced stipend and other beneﬁts pro-
vided by Genesis Faraday and the CASE partner, Avi-
agen Ltd.
The rationale for this gene-mapping approach is that
variation will be reduced in regions of the genome sub-
ject to positive selection. Patterns of genome-wide di-
versity may reveal regions that have been under strong
selection and contain genes with large phenotypic ef-
fects. This project will focus on the development, eval-
uation and application of methods of testing for selec-
tion using both simulated and genomic poultry data.
This studentship will thus provide training in popula-
tion and quantitative genetics, scientiﬁc computing and
bioinformatics.
The student will be based at The Roslin Institute and
the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IEB) at the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh. The Edinburgh genetics research
community is thriving, with strong expertise in pop-
ulation and quantitative genetics, making it an excit-
ing place to study. The student will also spend time
at Aviagen Ltd (Edinburgh), one of the major poul-
try breeders in the world with a strong commitment to
research.
We are seeking an enthusiastic individual with an in-
terest in population and evolutionary biology or animal
genetics and aptitude with computer-based numerical
analyses. The UK-based candidate should possess a
good quality ﬁrst degree in a relevant subject. En-March 1, 2009 EvolDir 39
thusiasm, dedication and aptitude are the most impor-
tant characteristics; additional training in genetics and
genome analysis are available at IEB.
The project involves a collaboration between Pam
Wiener (Roslin), Chris Haley (MRC Human Genet-
ics Unit), Brian Charlesworth (IEB) and Kellie Wat-
son (Aviagen). For further information, please contact

I am seeking an enthusiastic student with a background
in evolution, genetics, ecology or zoology to study: Par-
allel evolution of insecticide resistance in ﬂies Super-
vised by Dr Nina Wedell at the University of Exeter
UK
Insecticide resistance is rapidly reaching global ﬁxation
in many insect pest populations, hence there is an ur-
gent need to develop new approaches to the manage-
ment of agricultural pests and vectors of diseases. We
will examine the evolution of parallel insecticide resis-
tance in two related ﬂy species caused by two diﬀerent
retrotransposon (Accord and Doc) insertions into ho-
mologous cytochrome P450 genes, which confer DDT
resistance in both species. This provides an unrivalled
opportunity to examine the impact of a single gene on
the population genetics of two cosmopolitan ﬂy species.
DDT resistant Drosophila melanogaster females are
more fecund than susceptible females, but although re-
sistance alleles were present before the use of DDT, they
only occurred at low frequency, implying an unknown
cost to carrying the DDT resistance allele in males. In
D. simulans, the Doc insertion also confers DDT resis-
tance, but the potential costs and beneﬁts to males and
females has not been examined. There is evidence of a
selective sweep of both TE insertions in both species,
and intriguingly, the endosymbiont Wolbachia has also
rapidly spread through ﬂy populations in recent times.
We will quantify the ﬁtness consequences of DDT re-
sistance on male and female ﬁtness in both Drosophila
species and examine the interaction between homolo-
gous resistance genes and Wolbachia infection, to eval-uate their relative importance for ﬂy ﬁtness. This
will provide valuable information about the impact of
foreign DNA present in the genome of potential pest
species directly regulating their ﬁtness, which may be
useful in developing future pest management plans.

UExeter FungalTreeOfLife
PHD Studentship
Understanding the fungal tree of life.
Supervisors: Dr Thomas Richards, Dr Akbar Javadi,
and Prof. Nick Talbot
Deadline for Application: Friday 13 March 2009
Project summary: Standard approaches have failed to
resolve the ecological complexity and branching order of
the fungal tree of life. Environmental DNA sequencing
in combination with bioinformatic analysis has demon-
strated that microbial life has vastly more evolutionary
complexity than had previously been observed. This
project will use whole genome sequences, in combina-
tion with sophisticated phylogenetic models, to identify
the backbone of the fungal tree of life and understand
ancient fungal cell evolution. The project will also
use large-sale environmental DNA amplicon sequencing
to identify novel phylo-groups and discover how these
groups relate to the fungal tree of life. Together, these
data will identify the evolutionary history and the eco-
logical complexity of the fungal kingdom.
This project is ideal for a candidate interested in evolu-
tion and who wants to learn molecular and phylogenetic
methods.

InsectGenomeBioinformatics
Project title: Bioinformatics of next generation se-
quencing approaches: using 454 and Solexa data to look
at insect genomes and transcriptomes
Three-year studentship: tuition fees (UK/EU rate) and
annual stipend at current research council rate
This PhD will provide training in state of the art bioin-
formatics both at the genomic and transcriptomic level.
It takes advantage of a) the large amount of non-model
insect 454 sequence data generated by our laboratory,
b) our participation in the Heliconius genome project (3
species being sequenced at Baylor College of Medicine),
c) our ongoing collaboration with the Sanger Center
with BAC mapping and DNA sequencing and, most
importantly, d) our initiation of collaborations with
ecology and evolution groups in Cornwall. The project
aims to ﬁll the gap generated by the purchase of the
Illumina sequencer at Streatham and the analysis of
the pump priming projects from non-molecular biolo-
gists at both Tremough and Streatham Campuses of the
University of Exeter. The student will receive training
in the assembly and analysis of large next-generation
sequence data sets of both the genome (e.g. Helico-
nius) and the transcriptome. The student will learn
how to annotate ESTs and genomic DNA and to mine
the data for items of interest to non-molecular biolo-
gists e.g. SNPs and micro-satellite markers. Students
with a computing background will be involved in cre-
ating state-of-the art software to analyse -omic data
derived from non-model species. The exact nature of
the project will be decided with the candidate. For ex-
ample, SNPs will be used to look for gene ﬂow between
the diﬀerent islands of the Scillies to test if gene ﬂow
relates to the standing diﬀerences seen in eye spot vari-
ation between islands in the Meadow Brown (with Dave
Hosken). SNPs will also be used to look for gene ﬂow
and dispersal between the diﬀerent populations of the
endangered Marsh Fritillary in the South West (with
Dave Hodgson and Melanie Smee). Candidates with a
Computer Science background wishing to learn about
biology, evolution and comparative genomics are espe-
cially invited to apply.

UFribourg EvolutionaryGenetics
PhD Position in Evolutionary Genetics
Project: The genetics of reproductive isolation and
trait diﬀerences in European Populus
Supervision: Christian Lexer, University of Fribourg,
Switzerland
A PhD position is available in the newly established lab
of Christian Lexer. I am looking for a highly motivated
candidate with interests in the ﬁelds of evolutionary bi-
ology, population genetics, and ecology. The PhD fel-
lowship is university-funded, and the project will be
tightly linked with a British NERC-funded research
project on the ecological & evolutionary genomics of
species isolation in European Populus, which involves
a postdoc, two other PhD students, and several collab-
orating labs in the EU and USA.
The PhD project will address the genetics of reproduc-
tive isolation and ecological trait diﬀerences in Populus
alba and P. tremula. It is based on molecular genetic
data which my group has gathered over the last several
years, and on recent advances in the use of admixed
populations and hybrid zones for addressing key ques-
tions in ecology & evolution. Key aspects of the PhDMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 41
project will be (1) to study the molecular population
genetics of loci involved in species isolation, (2) to study
the genetic basis and ecological impact of trait diﬀer-
ences among diﬀerent genotypes in natural populations.
The project involves both, experimental lab work (se-
quencing, microsatellites, SNPs, interactions with re-
lated transcriptomics project) and ecological ﬁeld work
(assessment of tree biotic interactions). Depending on
the interests of the student, there can be a stronger
focus either on the lab or on the ﬁeld component. In
any case, an interest in new methods in computational
biology is essential.
The starting date is negotiable (any time from July
2009 onwards). Funding from the university is for three
years (annual salary is ca. CHF 40’000). Knowledge of
French or German is helpful in every day life, but the
working language in the group is English. A Diploma
or Masters degree (or equivalent) in biology or related
subject is necessary for admission. Fribourg is a lively
town with over a quarter of the population being stu-
dents. It‘s ca. 30 minutes from the Alps, close to other
cities such as Berne and Lausanne and just a little over
an hour from Geneva.
To apply, please send an e-mail with the application
materials in a single pdf ﬁle to Christian Lexer (chris-
tian.lexer@unifr.ch). Application materials should in-
clude a CV, a list of publications, and a short (less than
one page) statement of research interests. Please give
names and email addresses of two persons who are will-
ing to write a letter of recommendation. Applications
received before 30 March will be given full considera-
tion. Interviews will take place end of April or early
May.

UFribourg EvolutionPlantInvasions
1 PhD & 1 Post-Doc Position in Evolutionary Ecology
of Plant Invasions, University of Fribourg, Switzerland
RationaleThe proposed project will be the ﬁrst one that considers
the importance of polyploidy and herbivores for inva-
sions simultaneously. Our leading hypothesis is that
herbivore pressure and assemblage will, at least par-
tially, explain the predominance of speciﬁc cytotypes
both in the native and introduced range. The Centau-
rea stoebe L. (syn. C. maculosa Lam.) (Asteraceae)
system provides an excellent model system to study
these interactions, and we take advantage of the large
knowledge already available on this plant and its her-
bivores. Native to Europe where it occurs as a diploid
(2x) and a tetraploid (4x) cytotype, the species is highly
invasive in North America, where nearly exclusively
only 4x plants have been found. Several specialist in-
sect herbivores have been introduced to North America
for its biological control, with only partial success so
far.
We seek two highly motivated researchers to help clar-
ifying underlying mechanisms of this most successful
plant invasion as a complement to various presently on-
going studies that we carry out in collaboration with
both national (through NCCR Plant Survival) and in-
ternational partners. We plan to (i) explore the rela-
tionship between type and amount of herbivory and the
occurrence of the two cytotypes of C. stoebe in its na-
tive range by a European-wide survey combined with
a replant/transplant experiment, (ii) carry out a series
of experiments to analyze interactions between two se-
lected specialist herbivores and the C. stoebe cytotypes,
and (iii) investigate more generally into the role of gen-
eralist herbivores for plant invasions (in collaboration
with Urs Schaﬀner, CABI Europe-Switzerland and our
US counterparts).
Requirements
- PhD position: Master Thesis in Biology, preferentially
in ecology and evolution
- Post-Doc position: doctoral degree in plant ecology
and evolution
For both positions, knowledge of, and experience in one
or several of the following areas of research is desirable:
experimental (ﬁeld) ecology and evolutionary biology,
invasion biology, plant-herbivore interactions, experi-
mental design and statistical analysis; furthermore, ﬂu-

PhD position in Evolutionary Genomics (1.0 fte)
The PhD position is available at the Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Studies at the University of
Groningen. The candidate will join a recently started
research group that studies parasitoid-host interactions
to unravel the evolutionary genomics of adaptations.
The overall aim of the research group is to identify what
genomic features (e.g., SNPs, transposons, epigenetic
regulation) enable a rapid evolutionary response to ad-
verse environmental conditions. The aim of the PhD
project is to identify genomic variation among natu-
ral Drosophila melanogaster populations and associate
it to immunological resistance against their parasitoids.
The research will comprise a mix of ﬁeld work, genomic
techniques (tiling arrays and high-throughput sequenc-
ing), ﬂy biology and genetics, as well as bioinformatics.
Requirements and duties We seek an energetic PhD stu-
dent, to carry out this fundamental research project
at the forefront of evolutionary genomics. The can-
didate has a masterˆ as degree or equivalent in biology,
with a strong interest in evolutionary biology and a
background in genetics, genomics, evolutionary ecol-
ogy, molecular biology and/or bioinformatics. Good
analytical skills and a positive attitude towards learn-
ing new methods are required. Objective of the tem-
porary 4 years position is the production of a number
of research articles in peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals,which together will form the basis of a thesis leading
to a PhD degree (dr.) at the University of Groningen.
Candidates will enrol in the education and supervision
program of the Groningen Graduate School of Science.
Teaching duties of 10% of the time are foreseen.

Ph.D. position, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium
Experimental study of metapopulation dynamics and
viability with microcosms of a unicellular microorgan-
ism, Tetrahymena thermophila
Eﬃcient biodiversity conservation requires a clear un-
derstanding of factors aﬀecting (meta)population vi-
ability. Our research team studies the impact of
major perturbations (habitat fragmentation, climate
change...) on determinants of (meta)population vi-
ability (like habitat quality, demography, dispersal,
metapopulation dynamics...).
We are currently looking for a highly motivated stu-
dent to start a Ph.D. within the framework of a new
and stimulating project focusing on the experimental
study of metapopulation dynamics and viability with
microcosms of a unicellular microorganism, Tetrahy-
mena thermophila. Such microcosms are simpliﬁed ver-
sions of real world systems, with a level of control and
replication impossible to achieve on real populations.
We intend to use such microcosms to unravel the com-
plex links between life history traits, population struc-March 1, 2009 EvolDir 45

work). This project nicely complements our ongoing
research on threatened butterﬂy metapopulations.
Candidates should have excellent CV, with a back-
ground in ecology, conservation biology or evolution-
ary biology. Some research experience, and/or publica-
tions, in these ﬁelds are an asset.
You will work within a young research team at the Bio-

Dear Evoldir,

SECONDARY METABOLISM IN LICHENS - LINK-
ING GENES TO METABOLITES
Supervisors: Dr Daniel Barker, Dr Terry Smith and
Dr Shiela Unkles (University of St Andrews) and Dr
Rebecca Yahr (Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh)
Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or
cyanobacterium. Lichens form a major component of
many environments, particularly extreme environments
such as desert and arctic regions. Secondary metabo-
lites are chemicals produced by an organism that are
not directly involved in growth, but are beneﬁcial to its
well-being, for example through interactions betweenspecies such as competition and defense. Many sec-
ondary metabolites are useful to humans, for example
as antibiotics or dyes.
Secondary metabolites are particularly common in
lichen-forming fungi. An understanding of the biochem-
ical detail of secondary metabolism, its regulation, and
the evolutionary forces acting on these are often poorly
understood. The gene families involved in secondary
metabolism are often known, but the link between a
speciﬁc secondary metabolite and the gene coding for
the speciﬁc enzyme activity to make it, is often un-
known.
This proposal aims to link speciﬁc secondary metabo-
lites to their cognate genes. The project will focus on
investigating the evolution of the polyketide class of
secondary metabolites, and the underlying biosynthetic
and regulatory genes, in Porpidia. Porpidia is a lichen-
forming fungal genus in which secondary metabolites
vary both between, and within, species. The student
will carry out “wet” laboratory work and some ﬁeld-
work, and will develop and use novel bioinformatics al-
gorithms to integrate data on secondary metabolites
and genes.

PhD studentship, Experimental evolution in Chlamy-
domonas, University of Warwick, UK
We have recently been awarded Leverhulme Trust fund-
ing for an exciting new project to study the experimen-
tal evolution of resistance to herbicides in the unicellu-
lar chlorophyte, Clamydomonas reinhardtii. As part of
this 3-year project we are looking to recruit a postdoc-
toral researcher.
There is increasing recognition that human activities
are accelerating rates of global environmental change.
There is a concern that these changes are driving in-
creased rates of evolutionary change in the global biota.
The emerging and vibrant discipline of experimental
evolution oﬀers the possibility to study such ’evolution
in action’ to address fundamental and applied questions
in ecology and evolution. Our research uses Chlamy-
domonas as a model photosynthetic organism to study
the dynamics of evolution of resistance to herbicides.
This work addresses fundamental questions relating to
the evolution of tolerance/resistance to a novel stress
as well as practical issues surrounding the management
of a signiﬁcant constraint to global food production.
We are looking for enthusiastic and committed appli-
cants with a strong academic record in disciplines re-
lated to ecology and evolution. The project will start
in September 2009 and will be supervised by Dr Paul
Neve (Warwick HRI, University of Warwick) and Dr
Nick Colegrave (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, Uni-
versity of Edinburgh). The positions will be based at
University of Warwick, though it is expected that suc-
cessful applicants could spend some time in Edinburgh.
Indicative areas of research for the PhD student are:
evolution of resistance in simple (one herbicide) and
complex (multiple herbicide) environments, impact of
cycling diﬀerent herbicides on evolution of specialist
and generalist resistance types, impacts of simulated
gene ﬂow and habitat structure on resistance evolution.

Ubern: ﬁeld assistants bird evolutionary ecology
We are seeking 4 enthusiastic ﬁeld assistants inter-
ested in taking part in a ﬁeld study in Bern, Switzer-
land. Applicants will be part of the evolutionary ecol-
ogy team (Zoological Institute, Bern University). Our
study model is a passerine bird, the great tit. The tits
are a good model system as they are hole nesting birds,
breeding in forests near Bern, and as they can be easily
manipulated. We are part of a 10 people lab team, all
working with great tits in natural conditions. We work
with about 300 nest boxes for each, disposed in several
forests close to Bern. The study aims to investigate
the eﬀect of oxidative stress on sperm quality as well as
a potential heritability of these traits in the great tit.
This experiment will be conducted by Sylvain Losdat
(PhD).
We will require 2 ﬁeld assistants that will help with all
the aspects of the work, including checking nests, ring-
ing the birds, catching adults, performing treatments,
and more. Applicants with a Msc in Biology/Ecology
and/or with bird handling experience would have an
advantage. Supervising for potential Msc analysis andreport would be assured by PhD and Post-doc people
from the lab. Motivation will play a key role: the work
is hard and demanding, may take place in changing
weather and requires long hours at times. The study
will start at the end of March 2009 until the begin-
ning of June 2009. Fluent English or French speaking
is required as well as a valid European driving license.

INRA France InvasionDynamics
Permanent research position at INRA, the French Na-
tional Agricultural Research Institute
Population dynamics of invading populations
Description
The success or failure of biological invasions depends on
intrinsic demographic factors (demographic stochastic-
ity, Allee eﬀects), indirect demographic processes (the
eﬀect of population size on genetic variability and evo-
lution in the novel environment), or genetic processes
which reﬂect on demography (inbreeding depression).
In order to limit accidental invasions or to optimize in-
troduction strategies (biocontrol, reintroductions), it is
important to understand the nature and consequences
of such processes. In this perspective, we are recruit-
ing a research scientist with skills in population dy-
namics and a strong motivation to work on invasive
phenomena. We seek someone being able to develop
an approach based on experiments, but with a serious
theoretical background concerning processes at work
in small populations. One objective is to develop re-
searches combining academic approaches of invasion bi-ology - based on concepts from population biology and
evolutionary ecology - with the more applied research
ﬁeld of biological control. The recruited researcher will
bring a new competence in a team already involved
in population genetics and behavioral ecology (4-5 re-
searcher scientists, 4 research assistants and 4 PhD stu-
dents and postocs). There will also be some opportu-
nity to develop research programs with the technical
assistance of the local biological control research unit
(a dozen of research assistants including 3 PhD).
Practical Information
The position is open at the INRA Research Insti-
tute located in Sophia-Antipolis, South-East of France
(N43.612611; E7.077860). A PhD is mandatory, a post-
doc is a plus. The annual starting salary is 26000 32000
depending on experience. The deadline for submitting
the application (administrative) package is February
27^th 2009. Applications by non-French citizens are
welcome!

Mike Blouin is looking for a lab manager/head techni-
cian. The main projects in lab currently involve:
(1) DNA-based pedigree work on steelhead trout. In
particular, we are now studying why hatchery-raised
ﬁsh have lower ﬁtness than wild ﬁsh (includes study-
ing which traits might be under selection, and the loci
involved).
(2) Interactions between parasites and hosts. In partic-
ular, we are studying selection on loci that snails use
to defend themselves against infection by Schistosomes.
This is part of an NIH-funded project we do in collab-
oration with Chris Bayne’s lab.
The lab work will involve lots of genotyping (microsatel-
lites and other loci) and sequencing, and possibly some
gene expression work. Maintaining a large genotype
database error free will be an essential part of the work.

Species diversiﬁcation and coexistence in antbirds
A ﬁeld assistant is required to work with a PhD student
on a project investigating the roles of rivers and habitat
mosaics in driving population diﬀerentiation, by acting
as barriers to gene ﬂow, in populations of 3 species of
antbird. Based at the Los Amigos research centre, SE
Peru, the position requires extensive mist-netting and
bird ringing experience, and would suit someone with
an interest in avian ecology and evolutionary biology,
happy to live and work at a remote site in diﬃcult ﬁeld
conditions.
Day to day duties would include assisting in locating
birds using playback, mist-netting individuals for ring-
ing and bleeding, recording songs and subsequent indi-
vidual identiﬁcation. Therefore experience with iden-
tifying individuals based on colour rings would be ad-vantageous, as this is extremely challenging in the dense
forest understory.
The position would be for 2-4 months with dates to
be ﬁnalised (June-September 2009). Field station costs
will be covered but ﬂights would be the responsibility
of the assistant. Peruvian applications are encouraged,
and a basic salary will be oﬀered in these instances.

As is our practice, we have very broad deﬁnitions of
suitable areas of research:
Five New Academic Posts in Systems Biology at Exeter
The result of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise
conﬁrms Exeter?s position as one of the UK?s lead-
ing research-intensive universities. Almost 90% of our
research is at internationally recognised levels and ev-
ery single subject submitted was assessed as including
world-leading (4*) research. When adjusted for the
95% of staﬀ submitted, Exeter ranks among the top 15
in the UK for research out of 159 higher education insti-
tutions. The Times Higher Education described Exeter
as ’a rising star among research-intensive institutions’.
As 2007/08 THES University of the Year, Exeter also
rose four places to 13th in the Times league table of
UK universities and ranks 14 to 19 in tables published
by the Guardian, Sunday Times and Independent. Our
Streatham campus is widely regarded as one of the most
attractive in Britain, and the new purpose-built Corn-
wall Campus is superbly equipped to meet the chal-
lenges of the 21st century. In April 2008 the Univer-
sity of Exeter announced plans to invest £80 million in
science, engineering and medicine, building on existing
areas of excellence. An initial £30 million of existing
funds will be spent on new appointments, infrastruc-
ture and studentships in ﬁve groundbreaking interdis-
ciplinary research themes.
Systems Biology is one such theme. Our vision is for
a multidisciplinary approach to understanding biologi-
cal processes through the application of integrative and
predictive biology.
The Systems Biology Theme brings together the re-
search of over 50 academics in the disciplines of Ap-
plied Mathematics, Biosciences and Informatics across
both campuses. It will beneﬁt from synergies with the
recently announced Environment and Sustainability In-
stitute to be based on the Cornwall campus.
As part of this major research initiative in Systems Biol-
ogy, the School of Engineering, Computing and Math-
ematics (SECaM) and the School of Biosciences seek
highly motivated individuals for four new lectureships.

Field Assistants Required Columbian ground squirrels
Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada
We are looking for 3 volunteers to assist with ﬁeldwork
from April 01 to May 15, 2009, with the possibility ofextension to July 15. The project investigates the evo-
lutionary ecology of Columbian ground squirrels. As a
member of the study, assistants will be involved with
monitoring the phenology (when animals emerge from
hibernation), reproduction and survival of individuals.
Fieldwork will involve live-trapping and handling of an-
imals, behavioural observation and assistance with the
measurement of physiological (metabolism) traits on
free-ranging animals. This is an excellent opportunity
to gain experience working with a collaborative research
team on a long-term study of a wild mammal. All ﬁeld-
work is carried out in the spectacular Rocky MountainsMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 65
of western Alberta, Canada.
We will be staying at the University of Calgary?s
ﬁeld station in Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta.
You will interact with other researchers working with
ground squirrels on a diversity of projects in be-
havioural and population ecology. Additionally, the
ﬁeld station is home to a number of other researchers
working on a variety of projects, ranging from insects
to large mammals.
Food and accommodation costs are covered as are travel
costs to the ﬁeld station.
Training will be provided and no experience is neces-
sary, but candidates should have an interest in ecology
and evolutionary biology, enjoy the outdoors and be
optimistic.

BAC-end sequencing
Dear all,
I would like to sequence the ends of some BAC-clones
that are positive for a gene of interest. As I have un-
derstood this is a standard procedure, but I can’t seem
to ﬁn any good protocolls for this on the internet. I will
use both T7 and Sp6 primers, and I guess the idea is to
culture the positive clones over night, extract the DNA
(miniprep) and use this as a template for the Cycle-
Seq reaction for sequencing (we use Beckman Seq 8000
capillary sequencer).
Does anyone have any hands on tips and good proto-
colls for this? I’m particularly interested in knowing
how much template I will need for SycleSeq reaction
(otherwise I plan to use diﬀerent amounts to ﬁnd the
optimal). I guess the DNA extraction of the culture
will fragment the template, will this be a problem?
Thanks in advance!

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for my population and
whether they present Linkage Desequilibrium, using
GENEPOP. I would like to apply the sequential Bonfer-

Combining diversity indices
Dear Evoldir members,
I was wondering whether someone could be hav-
ing/knowing of an index combining diversity indices
(haplotype or nucleotide diversity), signals of expansion
(theta, tajimas D, Fu’s Fs etc), uniqueness of haplo-
types and the number of mutations between haplotypes
as determined from network analysis that could be com-
bined with archaeological dates (of bones for instance)
to provide an indication of the time of either arrival or
expansion of particular haplotypes/haplogroups/clades
in diﬀerent geographic regions of interest such as con-
tinents.
Any suggestions would be highly welcome
Thank you

Hi,
I have samples of very tiny parasitoid larvae (smaller
than 0.5mm) that I want to sequence. Most of them are
Tachinidae and some are Hymnoptera (probably Ich-
neumonoidea), and they were all obtained from Lepi-
doptera larvae. Some of the samples are three-years old,
but others are less than one-year-old. They are stored
in 100% ethanol, at 4o¯C, so I suppose that the DNA is
still good. Unfortunately I still didn’t mange to get the
right protocol for DNA extraction, specially in the case
of the Tachinidae. I have already tried one of Qiagen’s
extraction kits and also using promega extraction solu-
tions, but it doesn’t work. Since the larvae is so small,
I can’t even squash it, so I don’t know if this can also
inﬂuence the result. I would be very grateful if someone
could give me any suggestions on how to extract DNA
from such tiny insects.

DNA from schistosoma eggs
Dear Evoldir members,
I have a problem with extracting DNA from schisto-
soma eggs. The eggs of these ﬂatworm parasites are
passed out in the urine and faeces and if you expose
them to sunlight they will hatch to miracidia, the freel-
iving larva. We collected individual miracidia and eggs
on Whatman FTA cards. If you extract the DNA out of
the FTA punches, it yield good results for the miracidia
but not for the eggs. I have a feeling that the enzymes
which are released from the FTA card upon addition of
the sample (chemicals that lyse cells, denature proteins
and protect nucleic acids from nucleases), cannot pass
through the egg shell. We tried chitinase (2hrs at 42C)68 EvolDir March 1, 2009
but no result.
Does anyone has experience with this? Protocols for
DNA extraction of eggs stored in ethanol rather than
FTA are very welcome as well.

mth3@cornell.edu mth3@cornell.eduFrequency data software
Hi All,
Does anyone know of a software package that can take
allele frequency data, e.g. from multiple allozymes, and
use these to calculate Fst values? I am trying to make
use of data from some older papers that include a ta-
ble of allele frequencies in each population, but never
calculated pairwise Fst between populations. I know
that Arelquin takes frequency data, but the frequency
inﬁle format is not something I can ﬁgure out how to
use with mutliple loci as given in these types of tables.
Thanks for you thoughts, Amy
Amy Baco-Taylor <abaco@ocean.fsu.edu >
Frequency data software answers
Hi All,
Thanks to those who responded quickly. Just to clarify
on this (original post below), the data in the tables is
total allele frequencies for each population. There is
no information on which individuals had which alleles
or which alleles for a given locus occurred with which
alleles for another locus, so the types of inﬁiles used for
e.g. Fstat, Genepop and Genetix would not be possible
to make. Data example:
Locus Allele Pop1 Pop2 pgm A 0.5 0.3 B 0.5 0.7 Pgi A
0.3 0.5 B 0.7 0.5
Arlequin has a “frequency” data option, that takes fre-
quency data by population for a single locus, but to
enter mutliple loci, you need to know the multilocus
haplotypes, i.e. which alleles go together from diﬀer-
rent loci, e.g. the frequency of PgmA with PgiA is one
line, PgmB/PgiA the next, etc for all combinations.
Not something that can derived from these tables.
Thanks again for your thoughts and suggestions, Amy

Gel extraction advice
Hi evoldir
Can anyone recommend a really good kit for extracting
DNA from gels? The kits we have are frankly rubbish,
and we seem to lose way more of the DNA than we
should. I am interested in both info on kits that are
good for HMW DNA ( >20kb) and LMW DNA (100-
20kb) - they need not be the same kit of course.
Thanks in advance

Gel extraction advice answers
Dear Evoldir
A few weeks ago I posted a query on Gel extraction kits.
Thanks to all the replies, especially Robert Marra, Luiz
Marquez, Rossana Giordano, Karen Osborn, Will Fair-
brother, Violeta Munoz and Carla Hurt.
I promised several people a summary of what I found,
it follows right now,
Yours
Tom Gilbert
For DNA fragments <10kb:
QIAquick gel extraction kit - speciﬁcally one user found
80% recovery of a 1.5kb fragment and 60% of a 4kb
fragment.
Millipore Montage Gel Extraction Kit with Ultrafree-
DA centrifugal ﬁlter was recommended
Afurther reply indicated that a comparison of kitsshowed Zymoclean Gel DNA recovery kit was best,
Zymo Research Cat #D4001, for DNA from 75kb-23kb
There were a couple of more detailed replies that are
also of interest:
The enzyme Gelase was recommended. Speciﬁcally:
I used to use Promega gel puriﬁcation column kit
but recently I’ve switched to using Gelase followed by
ethanol/ammonium acetate puriﬁcation. The protocol
is very easy. You don’t have to change tubes or mess
with columns which is where much of the DNA loss oc-
curs. I ﬁnd that the yield is very good and usually very
clean so long as the digestion is complete. I’ve tried it
on DNA up to 2kb but I suspect it would work with
any size.
Modiﬁed protocol 1.)Melt the gel at 75 degrees 2.)Cool
it to 45 and then add the enzyme 3.)Let the gel digest at
45 degrees overnight (shorten the time by adding more
enzyme) 4.)Add 200ul 5M ammonium acetate and 800
ul absolute ethanol 5.)Centrifuge at high speed for 30
minutes 6.) Wash with 70% ethanol 7.) Evaporate the
ethanol and rehydrate in water .............
And then some useful insights followed in this message:
My experience is the lower percentage gel you can use
the better the whole thing works. But I can’t say I have
found anything that I am all that happy with. I like the
old school Crush n’ Soak method (Maniatis) - it gives
you about 50% recovery but the DNA is very clean.
The kits are not that great. I feel like I have tried many
and The Squeeze and Freeze (Biorad) is quick and easy.
It sometimes gives you 70% but is dirty. you have to
do a phenol chloroform precip afterwards. Make sure
you cut the gel into little pieces.
Invitrogen’s kit was bad. I found the quiagen gel ex-
traction kit better if the initial digestion is done longer
than the recommended time with lots of mixing.
Colleagues swear by electrophoresis based elution meth-
ods. There are combo UV boxes/horizontal elec-
trophoresis apparatus were you cut cubes out of gels
in front of the band, watch the DNA go in there, and
suck it out with a pipet and extract. In grad school
I cut out a cube with the band in it. Put the whole
thing in a dialysis tube and chucked it back in the gel
rig. That was eﬃcient and you could see the ethidium
stained DNA in a crease in the tubing but recovery
was a hassle. It was hard getting DNA out in a small
volume.

Guppy Genome Project
Dear all,
I looked around at NCBI if there is a guppy (Poecilia
reticulata) genome project, but did not ﬁnd it. Con-
sidering the many people who do research on this ﬁsh
I was irritated that there is nothing on it yet. I am
considering this ﬁsh as a model in a new proposal but
therefore I would like to know if there is at least a whole
genome sequencing project initiated, or will be initiated
soon.
I would be happy if anybody who know’s about any-
thing about a possible guppy genome project could con-
tact me.
Cheers, Robert

www.splitstree.org ) - To use any graphics software such
as Illustrator or Corel Draw - To use Network and im-
port the wmf ﬁle to Illustrator to touch it up/improve
the colour/resolution. Basic functions in Network are
free, though for more spiﬀy/eﬃcient things you need to
buy it. - To use Export the TCS network as a postscript
and improve with Illustrator, Inkscape, CorelDraw, etc.

LiCOR plates
Dear Evoldir
we have recently discovered, after months of painfulMarch 1, 2009 EvolDir 71
trouble-shooting, that there are multiple diﬀerent kinds
of glass for LiCOR 4200 and 4300 DNA analyzers, some
of which are useless with certain models of machine.
If you use the wrong plates or a mixture, you will get
focus errors, stalled runs after about 6 minutes, gels
that are focussed on one side but not the other and a
host of other incapacitating problems.
A brief summary:
1. Boroﬂoat glass plates come in two completely diﬀer-
ent kinds, pre-2003 and post-2003. They have the same
product name and same product number, yet the early
ones work well with 4200 machines, the latter ones are
USELESS. It remains a mystery why they would not be
given diﬀerent names and product codes. It has been
extremely debilitating for us.
The older and newer kinds of Boroﬂoat are distinguish-
able only by subtle diﬀerences in colour (the older ones,
which work on 4200, are yellowish, the newer ones,
which don’t work on 4200s, are nearly colourless).
2. Starphire glass plates are now the suggested ones
for 4200s. They probably do not work as well as old
Boroﬂoat, particularly in the 700 channel, on reactions
that are not very strong, but may be OK. Older Bo-
roﬂoat is not made any more, so even if they are bet-
ter, they are not really an option unless you have a
big stash. Starphire are bluish, and have two corners
dubbed (c.f. only one on Boroﬂoat).
3. ’New’ Boroﬂoat are suggested for the newest ma-
chines, the 4300s.
I have a summary document about all this, which in-
cludes a photographic ﬁeld guide to cryptic LiCOR
glass plates, which was not publicly released even
though it was intended to be, as far as I understand. I
will pass it along if you email me.
I would love to hear your stories if you have been on the
pointy end of these unhighlighted diﬀerences in glass
composition. At the least I would like LiCOR to have
a summary of the trouble it has caused to have good vs
useless versions of the same product, yet not have that
indicated and indeed highlighted in their materials.

Long term pedigrees
Dear Evoldir readers,
I would like to compile a list of long-term animal pop-
ulation datasets that include pedigree information. By
long-term I mean datasets that span 10 years or more.
If you know of any please can you let me know:
1) Species 2) Location (place name and lat/long) 3)
Start and (if applicable) end dates
It would also be useful if you could provide a reference
so I can read a bit about the project.

Measures of diversity Jost2008
Members of Evoldir,
I’ve written some software to calculate the new mea-
sures of diversity described in Jost 2008. It’s web acces-
sible at http://www.ngcrawford.com/django/jost/ and
takes ﬁles in GENEPOP format. I haven’t indepen-
dently veriﬁed my calculations, so if someone’s worked
them out by hand (e.g., in excel) and could let me know
if my calculations agree with theirs, that would be most
helpful.

Netherlands AvianRadioTracking
Field assistant needed for radio tracking Great tits
(Parus major) The Netherlands
In the end of February we will equipe 60 female great
tits (Parus major) with radio-transmitters. We will
follow them up until egg laying using radio tracking
equipement. Our main interest is where female great
tits forage in the period before egg laying. This is a
time consuming task and therefore I would like some
assistance. The main work will be radio tracking the in-
dividuals, however, we might also take branch samples
to ﬁnd out what they are eating. Fieldwork will take
place at 2 populations around Arnhem and Nijmegen.
Unfortunately there is no payment involved. We can
discuss about covering of costs of coarse.
Do you have nothing to do in March and the beginning
of April, and would you like to develop radio trackingskills?

R and F statistics question
Dear all,
I am working with plant microsatellites trying to know
about the genetic structure of a mangrove species.
I$B!G(Bve analyzed my data set using F and R statis-
tics. I’ve compared both Fst and Rst using spagedi
software in order to know which one is the best option
for my study. According to Hardy et al (2003) criteria,
I found that Rst explain better than Fst my data. So,
now I know that mutations have contributed to the ge-
netic diﬀerentiation in my species, which means that I
have to assume SMM. Assuming SMM model implies
that I have to work with Ris as a ﬁxation index. Could
someone tell me what software can I use to obtain Ris
per population (spagedi just does goblal Ris calcula-
tions)? Or could I continue using Fis taking into ac-
count that is calculated on Heterecigosity basis? I need

Redimensioned BIOSYS-2 software
Hi All
Many thanks to the EvolDir community for providing
me with the BIOSYS-2 software following my previ-
ous post. As it happens, my version was not corrupt
and merely needed to be redimensioned and recom-
piled. However, not knowing the second thing about
compiling, and unable to ﬁnd the suggested compiler
(Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler 5.1) or a living FOR-
TRAN expert, I have spent two months struggling with
it. Would anyone perhaps have a version of BIOSYS-2
that has already been redimensioned (essentially I need
the number of alleles it can handle to be increased from
10 to 22)? Appreciate anyone’s help (or a borrowed
copy of the compiler).
Many thanks!

Scoring MHC genotypes
I hope someone working with MHC genes in Salmonid
ﬁshes could help me with a mixture of protocol and
software problems.
I have been genotyping trout from infection challenge
experiments in three loci, which together code for clas-
sical MHC function of both MHCI and MHCII in rain-
bow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
Genotyping cDNA has generally gone well, although I
have trouble ﬁnding software that will align sequences
from the MHCI locus (onmy-UBA), since this locus
contains insertion/deletion heterozygotes. I am cur-
rently using CodonCode, but I end up doing very much
of the aligning and genotyping by hand, which takes
forever. I have also tried SeqScape from ABI and an
older version of Sequencher.
The gDNA genotyping has proven very diﬃcult in gen-
eral, with many individuals not producing readable se-
quence at all, although there is no reason my primers
shouldn’t work on gDNA.
I would very much like to discuss this with people
who have experience with software, which can align se-
quence with indel heterozygotes, or people who have
good experience with gDNA sequencing protocols for
MHC genes.
Thank you for any ideas or suggestions

SocIntegCompBiol boycott
NewOrleans
Witty article on the matter from New Orleans...
Mad scientists
Wednesday, February 18, 2009 James Gill
Perhaps you did not know that the Society for Inte-
grative and Comparative Biology had New Orleans in
mind for its 2011 annual meeting in New Orleans.
Perhaps you are not even familiar with the Society
for Integrative and Comparative Biology. Well, you’ve
missed your chance. Although New Orleans “has been
a popular venue of us in the past,” society president,
Richard Satterlie, has advised Gov. Bobby Jindal that
the 2011 meeting will go to Salt Lake City instead.
In his letter to Jindal, Satterlie says the society will be
urging other scientiﬁc organizations to “reconsider any
plans to host meetings in Louisiana.”
The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology is already committed to New Orleans for this
year, but that will be it. Its president Gregory Pet-
sko has declared, “No future meeting of our society will
take place in Louisiana as long as that law stands.”March 1, 2009 EvolDir 75
“That law” is the Louisiana Science Education Act,
which is named for what it is designed to destroy. Jin-
dal signed it last year, clearing the way for creationism
to be taught in biology class.
Satterlie wants Jindal to work for a repeal of the act in
this year’s session, but parting the Red Sea would be
child’s play by comparison. The bill received only three
nay votes in the House last year, and none at all in the
Senate, so even if Jindal were prepared to heed the voice
of reason, he could probably never twist enough arms
in the corridors of the Capitol to engineer a repeal.
But the voice of reason cuts no ice with Jindal anyway,
at least on this issue. He refused to veto the bill last
year, ignoring the pleas not only of Satterlie’s group,
but the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, a slew of other learned bodies and even his old
genetics professor from Brown University.
The force behind the bill was the Louisiana Family
Forum, a group of Christian soldiers that few politi-
cians would wish to cross, given that polls suggest a
startlingly high number of Americans refuse to accept
that mountains of scientiﬁc evidence prove the truth of
evolution.
While some politicians might kowtow to the forum out
of expediency, Jindal does not appear to be one of them.
He actually appears to believe this stuﬀ. Darwin or
Genesis? You pays your money and you takes your
choice, so far as the Louisiana Science Education Act
is concerned.
This legislation is straight out of the Dark Ages, but it
will remain on the books even if every scientist in the
land joins in the boycott.
The Family Forum has this administration in its
clutches. Not only has Jindal, in his ostentatious
Catholicism, voiced doubts about evolution, but his
chief of staﬀ, Timmy Teepell, is an old friend of Fo-
rum director, Gene Mills. Jindal’s labor secretary, Tim
Barﬁeld, is a founding member of the Forum.
Satterlie’s letter to Jindal included a somewhat heavy-
handed and superﬂuous reminder that conventions “can
contribute to the economic regime of any commu-
nity.” His society’s convention held in Boston this year
“brought over 1,850 scientists and graduate students to
the city for ﬁve days,” Satterlie wrote.
Dependent though this city is on the extravagance of
strangers, Forum zealots are not going to be deterred
by such mundane considerations. If the intellectual,
and therefore economic, health of the state were of any
concern, they wouldn’t be so eager to lumber us with
generations of scientiﬁc ignoramuses.Their own intellectual honesty may be measured
through their repeated denials that the Louisiana Sci-
ence Education Act had a religious purpose in allowing
the introduction of “supplemental materials” in science
class.
How they squawked when a Board of Elementary and
Secondary Education task force called their bluﬀ and
included a ban on “the teaching of creationism or intel-
ligent design” in rules it drew up to implement the act.
The board licked Mills’ hand and removed the ban.
So scientists are going to be thin on the ground around
here. What economic eﬀect the Louisiana Science Ed-
ucation Act will have, however, is hard to say, since
maybe there will be an inﬂux of fundamentalists to take
up the slack.
The city economy might still suﬀer a net loss anyway,
since, when it comes to cocktail time, one biologist is
probably worth at least six Bible literalists.

Software Nemo 2 1 released
Dear Evoldir members,
I am happy to announce a major update of Nemo,
version 2.1.0, available on SourceForge ( http://-
nemo2.sourceforge.net ).
Nemo is a forward-time, individual-based, genetically
explicit, and stochastic simulation program designed
to study the evolution of life history/phenotypic traits
and population genetics in a ﬂexible (meta-)population
framework.
The two major updates for this release are:
- Temporal parameter modiﬁers (change simulation set-
tings during a the course of a simulation) and popula-
tion ﬁssion/fusion, bottlenecks, etc.
- Data saving and loading from text ﬁles (e.g. FSTAT
ﬁles for neutral markers), allows to use ﬁeld genetic
data in simulations, for instance.
General presentation:
Nemo implements many diﬀerent life cycle events and
genetic traits. It also allows to model species interac-76 EvolDir March 1, 2009
tion between a parasite and its host (i.e. Wolbachia).
All this is framed within a ﬂexible metapopulation
model that allows for patch-speciﬁc carrying capaci-
ties, dispersal rates, and extinction/harvesting rates,
etc. Populations can be dynamically modiﬁed during a
simulation, allowing for population bottlenecks, patch
fusion/ﬁsson, and expansion, etc.
Nemo’s interface is a simple text ﬁle containing the sim-
ulation parameters and their values. It is run on the
command line. Each parameter can have several ar-
gument values thus allowing to run many simulations
from a single init ﬁle. Parameters can also be set with
temporal values that will automatically modify the sim-
ulation settings during its run.
Nemo is also intended as a C++ developing frame-
work. The complete code documentation and cod-
ing guidelines for the development of new evolution-
ary models using Nemo are available at <http://-
nemo2.sourceforge.net >. Binaries for Mac OS X
and Win32 are available for download at http://-
sourceforge.net/project/nemo2 . The complete source
code and user documentation are available at the same
address.
Nemo v2.1.0 includes the following features:
- customizable sequence of life cycle events (breeding,
dispersal, aging, selection, etc.)
- temporal parameter modiﬁers (in the conﬁguration
ﬁle, check the manual!)
- ﬂexible population model, from the Island Model to
explicit spatial structure with dynamic population sizes
- several mating systems: o random mating
(promiscuity) o polygyny o monogamy o selﬁng /
hermaphroditism o cloning
- the available individual’s traits are: o sex-speciﬁc dis-
persal o deleterious mutations o neutral markers (bi-
or multi-allelic) o cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing
endosymbiotic parasite (Wolbachia)
- lots of statistics for each trait and the population dy-
namic, including: o F-statistics (Gst, theta, heterozy-
gosities, etc.), Nei’s D o coancestry analysis for the
neutral trait o inbreeding load dynamics (mutation fre-
quencies, ﬁxation rate, heterosis, genetic load, lethal
equivalents, etc.) o dispersal rates o population de-
mography and kinship analysis o population ﬁtness and
survival o and more...
- data saving and loading in binary mode or from text
ﬁles (FSTAT ﬁles for neutral markers)
- please have a look at the user manual for more features
and detailsNemo allows to run simulations in batch mode by run-
ning several simulations from the same input param-
eters ﬁle or from several such ﬁles. Nemo also runs
in parallel computing environments by using the MPI
standard.
This is an open-source, free software project, so feel free
to contribute!
and enjoy...

SmallMammalEvolution
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
>From May 2009 onwards, especially for July/August
to December 2009
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons of group living, paternal care, communal nesting
and social ﬂexibility in the striped mouse. As this
species is diurnal and the habitat is open, direct be-
havioral observations in the ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able

Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld; maintenance of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
750 (around 65 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
170 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 250 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for two volunteers to start in April / May 2009 and
several volunteers that want to come during the period
July/ August to December 2009. Volunteers are ex-
pected to stay at least 2 months, but longer periods of
up to 6months are preferred.

Working as a ﬁeld assistant in Goegap Nature Reserve
A report by Romy H¨ oppli, student at the University of
Zurich, who staid in Goegap June to August 2008
Blue skies without a single cloud for six weeks - rocky
mountains with little vegetation - yellow, orange and
pink ﬁelds of ﬂowers in whatever direction you look
- small mammals, lizards and birds in our front yardand Mountain Zebras, Springbok and Ostrich right next
door...
This was my time at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-
tion in Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa! During
six weeks from the beginning of July until the middle of
August I’ve been living here, studying mice, experienc-
ing nature like never before and being part of a small
community where there was always something to laugh
and joke about!
After arriving in Goegap, right the next morning my
scientiﬁc adventure in South Africa began: Setting and
checking traps, nest observations and radio-tracking
were our daily routine. While I got bitten by the mice
quite often in the beginning and my right middle ﬁn-
ger was scarred all over, I improved quickly shaking the
mice out of the traps, weighing them and checking the
number of the ear tag. Other duties like cleaning the
cages of the mice in the captive colony, washing the dirt
from probably several months out of the traps, paint-
ing the new Wendy House and putting in a ﬂoor and
curtains quickly added to our daily ﬁeld work activities.
It was never boring in Goegap! There was always some-
thing to do: studying the striped mouse, listening to the
interesting and funny

Stenamma ant samples
Dear Evolutionary Biologists,
I am a graduate student at the University of California,
Davis and I work on the systematics of the ant genus
Stenamma. One of my goals is to produce a broad-scale
phylogeny of the genus. However, I have not been able
to obtain fresh specimens from Europe or Asia. If you
have any recently collected specimens perserved in 90-
100% etoh I would be very grateful if you could send
me a few. The genus is a cold hardy cryptic group,
whose members are most often ecountered in forest leaf
litter samples (Winkler or Berlese). Please let me know
if you can help in any way.

Dear Colleagues,
The Texas State Board of Education is considering sev-
eral changes to the state science curriculum that will
undermine eﬀective coverage of evolution in high-school
biology classes. Proposed anti-evolution language will
also put pressure on textbook publishers to incorpo-
rate creationist criticisms of evolution or else risk being
excluded from the monolithic Texas textbook market.
The board members are receiving thousands of emails
from creationists supporting the current curriculum
draft. To keep scientiﬁcally unfounded arguments out
of our schools’ biology classes, we need help from each
and every one of you. Please email the 15 members of
the State Board and urge them to
(1) adopt the scientiﬁcally sound curriculum standards
drafted by a working group of teachers and scientists in
December, and
(2) reject amendments to these standards that have
been proposed by anti-evolution members of the State
Board of Education.
Below, we provide instructions on how to contact State
Board of Education members. Although we include a
form letter below, we encourage you to personalize the
email. Below, we also provide a succinct explanation of
the current status of curriculum revision in Texas.

Please email members of the State Board Of Educa-
tion, encouraging them to adopt the original draft of
the standards proposed by working groups in Decem-
ber.
You can email the entire SBOE directly at
sboeteks@tea.state.tx.us.
Here is a template for an email to the SBOE (we en-
courage you to personalize this):
To the Texas State Board of Education,
As a scientist and active researcher and educator, I am
writing to urge you to support sound science education
in Texas. In particular, I request that you adopt the Bi-
ology and Earth Sciences TEKS draft as originally pro-
posed by the Working Groups. These working groups
are composed of educators and scientists with deep
expertise in science, and their proposed TEKS drafts
should be given unreserved support without amend-
ment.
In particular, I object to the recent changes made to
the highschool TEKS (subchapter C) section 112.34
(c) 7.B: “analyze and evaluate the suﬃciency or in-
suﬃciency of common ancestry to explain the sudden
appearance, stasis, and sequential nature of groups in
the fossil record;” This language inaccurately insinu-
ates that the fossil record supports long-standing cre-
ationist arguments that existing species were created as
they exist today. The present wording is misleading. I
also object to changes to section 112.36 (c) 8.A, which
now read: “evaluate a variety of fossil types, proposed
transitional fossils, fossil lineages, and signiﬁcant fos-
sil deposits and assess the arguments for and against
universal common descent in light of this fossil evi-
dence” ; Transitional fossils are not “proposed” - they
are clearly documented based on detailed anatomical
measurements. Also, the phrase “arguments for and
against universal common descent” is a common cre-
ationist phrase that inaccurately suggests that there is
credible scientiﬁc data arguing against common ances-
try.
In conclusion, please revert to the original working
group version of the science TEKS, and resist addi-
tional changes that are not approved by the working
groups of scientists and educators.
Sincerely,

Some suggestions for emailing the SBOE1. You can specify in your email to
sboeteks@tea.state.tx.us that you wish your mes-

tone depending on which members you are writing
to. For instance, the Science Supporters [Bob Craig;
Mary Helen Berlanga; Pat Hardy; Rene Nunez; Mavis

TEKS, and are being hammered by angry emails from
creationists. When emailing these members, please be

MaxPlanck Leipzig
PrimateEvolution
Researchers in the department of Primatology of the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
in Leipzig study various aspects of the evolution of so-
cial systems, culture, ecology, and behavior in primates,
with a particular emphasis on great apes. Apes live in a
variety of social systems, within which we can examine
reproductive strategies, aspects of cognition and cul-
tural variation, and behavioural diversity within and
among social units. Particularly interesting are the
diﬀerences between apes and humans in fundamental
social-cognitive processes involving communication, co-
operation, social interactions, behaviors used to resolve
conﬂict, and social learning.
Two post-doctoral research positions Or: One post-
doctoral research position and one assistant professor
position
are currently available. Ideal candidates preferably
should have research experience related to the topics
addressed in the department, but it is not necessary to
have previous research focused on primates, and should
be able to play an important role in consolidating and
linking theoretical approaches with empirical data. Ap-
plicants should have a Ph.D. in Biology, Anthropol-
ogy, Ecology or Mathematics and at least 2 years of
post doc experience. Prior experience with modeling

Post-doc: Genetic hitchhiking in spatially structured
populations
Supervision: Denis Roze (CNRS, Roscoﬀ) and Nicolas
Bierne (CNRS, Montpellier)
A post-doctoral position is opened at the Institut des
Sciences de lEvolution, (CNRS-Universit´ e Montpellier),
Montpellier, France, and at the Station Biologique de
Roscoﬀ (CNRS-Universit´ e Paris 6), Brittany, France.
The proposed work consists in the development of the-
oretical population genetics models to study genetic
hitchhiking in spatially structured populations. Recent
methods use measures of genetic diﬀerentiation (Fst)
at neutral loci in order to locate genes that are se-lected diﬀerently in diﬀerent regions of a species dis-
tribution range (genome scans). However, the theory
on the eﬀects of selection on linked, neutral variation
in spatially structured populations remains little de-
veloped. A combination of mathematical and simula-
tion approaches will be used to explore the eﬀects of
diﬀerent adaptive/demographic scenarios on patterns
of neutral variation (allele frequency spectra, linkage
disequilibrium...) in spatially structured populations.
These models will be used to identify whether some
statistics (if not at the level of a single locus, at the
level of a whole scan) may be used to discriminate be-
tween these scenarios. Genome scan data from diﬀer-
ent species of marine invertebrates will be available in
order to test these methods. Once this ﬁrst work ac-
complished, a second subject will be to develop models
of speciation in spatially structured populations, focus-
ing on the interaction between heterogeneous selection
and the evolution of endogeneous (Dobzhanski-Muller)
incompatibilities.
Candidates should have a strong background in theoret-
ical population genetics. Strong motivation, communi-
cation skills and commitment are expected. Although
knowledge of French is helpful in every day life, the
working language will be English.
The position starts with a ﬁrst period of 14 months at
the Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution (Montpellier-
S` ete, France, http://www.isem.cnrs.fr ), starting be-
tween April and September 2009, and will be expand-
able to a second period of 14 months at the Station Bi-
ologique de Roscoﬀ (Brittany, France, http://www.sb-
roscoﬀ.fr ). The salary will range from 1800 to 2500 per
month depending on the experience of the candidate.
Applicants should send a CV including summary of
past research, current interests and motivation for the
present project, as well as contact information for three

1 PhD & 1 Post-Doc Position in Evolutionary Ecology
of Plant Invasions, University of Fribourg, Switzerland
Rationale
The proposed project will be the ﬁrst one that considers
the importance of polyploidy and herbivores for inva-
sions simultaneously. Our leading hypothesis is that
herbivore pressure and assemblage will, at least par-
tially, explain the predominance of speciﬁc cytotypes
both in the native and introduced range. The Centau-
rea stoebe L. (syn. C. maculosa Lam.) (Asteraceae)
system provides an excellent model system to study
these interactions, and we take advantage of the large
knowledge already available on this plant and its her-
bivores. Native to Europe where it occurs as a diploid
(2x) and a tetraploid (4x) cytotype, the species is highly
invasive in North America, where nearly exclusively
only 4x plants have been found. Several specialist in-
sect herbivores have been introduced to North America
for its biological control, with only partial success so
far.
We seek two highly motivated researchers to help clar-
ifying underlying mechanisms of this most successful
plant invasion as a complement to various presently on-
going studies that we carry out in collaboration with
both national (through NCCR Plant Survival) and in-
ternational partners. We plan to (i) explore the rela-
tionship between type and amount of herbivory and the
occurrence of the two cytotypes of C. stoebe in its na-
tive range by a European-wide survey combined with
a replant/transplant experiment, (ii) carry out a series
of experiments to analyze interactions between two se-
lected specialist herbivores and the C. stoebe cytotypes,
and (iii) investigate more generally into the role of gen-
eralist herbivores for plant invasions (in collaboration
with Urs Schaﬀner, CABI Europe-Switzerland and our
US counterparts).
Requirements
- PhD position: Master Thesis in Biology, preferentially
in ecology and evolution
- Post-Doc position: doctoral degree in plant ecology
and evolution
For both positions, knowledge of, and experience in one
or several of the following areas of research is desirable:94 EvolDir March 1, 2009
experimental (ﬁeld) ecology and evolutionary biology,
invasion biology, plant-herbivore interactions, experi-
mental design and statistical analysis; furthermore, ﬂu-
ency in English and driverˆ as license will be required.
Salary and conditions
The positions are funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation, and start April 1, 2009. Salaries: PhD
c. 43ˆ a000 SFr/year for 3 years; Post-Doc dependent on
age and status, gross salary in the ﬁrst year about CHF
70’000, for 2-3 years.

UNottingham SnailChirality
We are looking for an enthusiastic postdoc, graduat-
ing PhD student, or highly competent RA to work on
a three year BBSRC post to “unwind snail chirality”.
The most essential skill is that the person should be an
excellent molecular biologist. It would also be a beneﬁt
if they have experience with RNA and/or mapping, but
neither are strictly necessary.
One bonus is that technological improvements mean
that the project is now easier than originally en-
visaged. A second bonus is that snails are of-
ﬁcially hot!!! (Grande & Patel 2008 Nature
doi:10.1038/nature07603)
Work will take place within newly refurbished labora-
tories in the School of Biology, and in conjunction with
colleagues in the Evolutionary Biology and Develop-
mental Genetics research groups. We are a friendly
research group on a green and spacious campus, with
suitable housing within walking distance. As the per-
son will gain experience in a wide range of techniques,
including extensive use of new sequencing technologies
via our collaborator Mark Blaxter (in beautiful Edin-
burgh), the post should be excellent training for a fu-
ture career in research.
[This is a readvertisement because the original can-
didate was forced to pull out at the last minute for
personal reasons. Previous candidates may wish to in-
formally contact me if they are considering applying
again].

Unwinding snail chirality
Applications are invited for the above post to work on
a project funded by the BBSRC to “unwind snail chi-March 1, 2009 EvolDir 97
rality”. A deep-seated theoretical problem has stoked
a burning interest in understanding the symmetry-
breaking event during development - how is one side of
an organism consistently distinguished from the other,
given that the side that is called ’right’ is essentially
arbitrary? Although most prior research has concen-
trated on models such as the mouse, chick and frog,
the coiling or chiral variation of the pond snail Lym-
naea may be crucial in coming to understand asymme-
try. This is especially so, since it has very recently been
discovered that a key asymmetry gene has a conserved
function in both molluscs and vertebrates, implying a
common origin (Grande & Patel 2008 Nature Advance
Online doi:10.1038/nature07603).
The objective of this project is to take advantage of the
latest advances in DNA sequencing technology to char-
acterise the maternally-inherited determinant of chi-
rality in snails. A parallel postdoctoral researcher in
Professor Mark Blaxter’s laboratory at the University
of Edinburgh will lead the bioinformatic analyses, and
there may also be collaboration with David Lambert’s
laboratory in Rochester, New York. As the person ap-
pointed will gain experience in a wide range of tech-
niques, including extensive use of new sequencing tech-
nologies, the post should be excellent training for a fu-
ture career in research. Work will take place within
newly refurbished laboratories in the School of Biology,
and in conjunction with colleagues in the Evolutionary
Biology and Developmental Genetics research groups.
Candidates should ideally, although not necessarily,
possess a PhD in molecular genetics or equivalent qual-
iﬁcation in a related discipline. Experience of working
with RNA and/or genetic mapping will be an advan-
tage, but is not essential.
Salary will be within the range £24,152 - £35,469
per annum, depending on qualiﬁcations and experience
(salary can progress to £38,757 per annum, subject
to performance) - ( £26,391, maximum without PhD).
This post, funded by the BBSRC, is available to start
as soon as possible and will be oﬀered on a ﬁxed-term
contract for a period of three years.

UOslo 2 Biosystematics
2 POSITIONS AS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW-
SHIPS in biosystematics/evolutionary biology avail-
able at National Centre for Biosystematics (NCB),
Natural History Museum, University of Oslo (UiO).
The National Centre for Biosystematics (NCB)
(http://www.nhm.uio.no/ncb/ ) is a strategic, inter-
disciplinary research centre at the Natural History
Museum (NHM), performing research in modern
systematics and biodiversity at a high international
level. The NCB integrates research groups working
on plants, fungi and animals, which to a large extent
utilize similar molecular genetic tools in their research.
The NHM has a modern DNA laboratory with all
necessary facilities and has access to a pyrosequencing
instrument at the UiO. The postdocs will work in an
interdisciplinary and stimulating research environment
together with other postdocs, Ph.D. students, and
guest researchers. The postdocs will work on the
following project, funded by the Research Council of
Norway: BarFrost V Reconstruction of past ecosys-
tems by barcoding DNA preserved in permafrost.
The objective of the project is to reconstruct past
ecosystems from molecular analyses of permafrost soils
and to assess ecological implications of the results by
1) developing new DNA markers for several groups of
organisms to be used for species identiﬁcation based on
degraded DNA, 2) constructing taxonomic reference
databases of the most common arctic species based
on sequencing of these DNA markers in ﬁeld and
recent museum collections, 3) identify species by py-
rosequencing environmental ancient DNA from dated
permafrost cores, and 4) to assess to which extent these98 EvolDir March 1, 2009
new reconstructions can be used to address species
turnover dynamics, niche stability, and backward
testing of predictive species distribution models. The
project includes vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi,
invertebrates, and vertebrates. It is connected to
a large, ongoing EC-funded project, ECOCHANGE
(http://www.ecochange-project.eu ), where one of the
main activities concerns similar analyses of vascular
plants. The postdocs will stay for periods in other
ECOCHANGE laboratories to develop expertise in
ancient DNA analysis, pyrosequencing, and bioin-
formatics. Applicants must hold a PhD degree (or
equivalent) in biology and have a solid practical and
theoretic background in molecular genetic methods.
Good knowledge of at least one of the groups of organ-
isms involved is preferable, as well as some previous
training in bioinformatics. Emphasis will be given
to the applicants academic competence and personal
abilities to carry out the project. The postdocs will
also participate in supervision of PhD and Master
students. Candidates whose thesis is accepted for
public defense are also able to apply. The postdocs will
initially be hired for 2 years, with a possible extension
for up to 1 year. The procedures for employments
are in general regulated by the rules for employ-
ment in post doctor positions/scientiﬁc positions

UWarwick ExperimentalEvolution
Postdoctoral position, Experimental evolution in
Chlamydomonas, University of Warwick, UK.
We have recently been awarded Leverhulme Trust fund-
ing for an exciting new project to study the experimen-
tal evolution of resistance to herbicides in the unicellu-
lar chlorophyte, Clamydomonas reinhardtii. As part of
this 3-year project we are looking to recruit a postdoc-
toral researcher.
There is increasing recognition that human activities
are accelerating rates of global environmental change.
There is a concern that these changes are driving in-
creased rates of evolutionary change in the global biota.
The emerging and vibrant discipline of experimental
evolution oﬀers the possibility to study such ’evolution
in action’ to address fundamental and applied questions
in ecology and evolution. Our research uses Chlamy-
domonas as a model photosynthetic organism to study
the dynamics of evolution of resistance to herbicides.
This work addresses fundamental questions relating to
the evolution of tolerance/resistance to a novel stress
as well as practical issues surrounding the management
of a signiﬁcant constraint to global food production.
We are looking for enthusiastic and committed appli-
cants with a strong academic record in disciplines re-
lated to ecology and evolution. Experience of tech-
niques in microbial experimental evolution would be
an advantage. The project will start in September 2009and will be supervised by Dr Paul Neve (Warwick HRI,
University of Warwick) and Dr Nick Colegrave (Insti-
tute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh).
The positions will be based at University of Warwick,
though it is expected that successful applicants could
spend some time in Edinburgh.
Indicative areas of research are: impacts of herbicide
dose on ﬁtness landscapes and rates of evolution, pop-
ulation size and mutation supply rate, ﬁtness costs asso-
ciated with evolution of herbicide resistance and the po-
tential for reversion of resistance and/or compensatory
evolution, the impacts of sex on the evolution of resis-
tance.

We are looking for a theoretical ecologist/modeler to
ﬁll (as soon as possible) a full three year PostDoc posi-
tion to work on evolutionary ecology of movement and
dispersal. The successful candidate will join the Theo-
retical Ecology group at the Field Station Fabrikschle-
ichach 60km east of Wuerzburg (Germany) and work in
an EU funded project addressing questions concerning
the evolution and ecological consequences of movement
rules (and the dispersal deriving from them) in hetero-
geneous landscapes. We are striving for an approach
to ﬁrst, identify individual movement rules, second to
integrate the consequences of such rules for population
level processes and third, to understand the inﬂuence
of these population level consequences for the evolution
of movement rules. The project is carried out together
with ﬁeld ecologists and theoreticians in France and the
UK. From the successful candidate we expect the ability
and an interest to work on conceptual and theoretical
issues in evolutionary ecology. We will certainly ap-
preciate experience in simulation programming and/or
development of numerical programs. A background in
dispersal ecology or other areas of spatial ecology will
be helpful. We are seeking a team oriented candidate100 EvolDir March 1, 2009

ESF workshop on evolutionary and physiological adap-
tation to climate induced environmental changes:
Dear all,
We would like to invite young scientists to submit ab-
stracts for oral and poster presentations for a workshop
on evolutionary and physiological adaptation to climate
induced environmental changes.
The European Science Foundation ﬁnances the work-
shop through the networking programs ConGen and
ThermAdapt. In the workshop, we will merge knowl-
edge from population genetics and molecular and evo-
lutionary physiology in a multidisciplinary fashion and
discuss possible approaches to get a deeper under-
standing of mechanisms behind adaptation to thermal
changes.
We have invited approximately twenty leading re-
searchers within the ﬁeld to give talks and have space
for additional 30-35 short presentations and/or poster
presentations. Priority will be given to young scien-
tists (PhD or post docs) from EU countries, particu-
larly from those countries that support one or both of
the ESF programmes (see www.esf.org/thermadapt and
www.esf.org/congen for a list of countries).
The workshop will be held in Bialowieza (Poland) from
28 June (date of arrival) to 2 July 2009 in the EU Cen-
tre of Excellence (MRI PAS) Mammal Research Insti-
tute (Polish Academy of Science). Accommodation and
food are covered by the ESF. Furthermore, after appli-
cation some young researchers may get covered their
travel expenses or parts thereof.

This is an announcement of:
PhD Summer School 2009 at Eawag in Kastanienbaum,
Switzerland: “Interactions between ecological and evo-
lutionary processes in aquatic systems”
July 5-18, 2009
The course will confront selected PhD students with the
challenge of integrating ecosystems ecology and evolu-
tionary biology, arguably the least well-integrated pair
of disciplines in ecology. Some have described this chal-
lenge as the last missing synthesis in ecology. We will
take a multidisciplinary look at lake ecology, ask how
nutrient ﬂuxes shape microbial and algal activity and
diversity, how these in turn exert ecological and evolu-
tionary pressure on organisms at higher trophic levels,
and lastly, how adaptive evolution at higher trophic
levels exerts ecological pressures at lower levels that
possibly change ecosystem dynamics. The 2009 course
will be built around diﬀerent aspects of ecological sto-
ichiomentry. The course will consist of theoretical and
conceptual lectures and practical research modules in-
cluding laboratory and ﬁeldwork that seek to demon-
strate experimental approaches. Lectures will be given
by our invited lecturers James Elser, Nelson Hairston,
Eric Triplett, Andrew Hendry and Eawag scientists.
Concepts taught include e.g. feedback between bio-
geochemical conditions and microbial ecology, micro-
bial structure and activity, food webs, adaptive evolu-
tionary dynamics of predator-prey relations, ecosystem
eﬀects of evolution at ecological time scales.
The Summer School course will be held at Eawag Kas-
tanienbaum, near Lucerne, in Switzerland. Eawag is
the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Tech-
nology, and the Kastanienbaum Centre for Ecology,
Evolution and Biogeochemistry (CEEB) is situated at

workshop is to introduce young researchers to the range
of modelling approaches used in speciation research and
to the principal results of recent theoretical work in
this area. The workshop consists of lectures given by
leading scientists in speciation theory (including Nick
Barton, Mark Kirkpatrick and Sander van Doorn) and
practicals where the participants learn to understand
and analyze the building blocks of speciation models.
The workshop will focus on three themes:
- Population genetics of speciation - Adaptive dynamics
of speciation - Sexual selection and speciation
Each day will be dedicated to one of these themes. In
the morning, the instructors will give two or three re-
view lectures, while the afternoons will be devoted to
practicals and paper discussions.
Detailed information about the workshop programme,
registration and accommodation in Groningen will
be available soon on the SPECIATION ITN website

Special Workshop: Synthesizing Ecology and Evolution
for the Study of Invasive Species
Organizers: Carol Lee, Kristina Schierenbeck, Robert
Holt
We have organized a workshop to promote the integra-
tion of ecological and evolutionary perspectives and ap-
proaches toward the study of invasive species. Our aim
is to create a venue in which discussion among partici-
pants would lead to novel synthetic research and papers
that reﬂect the novel syntheses. For example, the inte-
gration of population genetics and population dynamics
could yield insights into the lag period of invasions, evo-
lutionary responses to novel environments, and range
expansions, oscillations, and extinctions. Also, inte-
grating empirical data on ecological factors, such as
predation or competition, with genetic factors, such as
quantitative genetic variance or the genomic architec-
ture of critical traits, could enhance our understand-
ing on factors that limit invasions and improve the ef-ﬁcacy of predictive models, including those that might
aid in biological control. Invasive species provide an
ideal testing ground for many basic evolutionary theo-
ries, and we hope that this workshop will help expand
this potential.
This event will be held March 19-22, 2009 at North Lake
Tahoe, California, USA. The workshop will consist of
talks by invited speakers (listed below), group discus-
sions, and posters sessions. Conference attendance will
be limited to 100.
The workshop will take place during prime ski season
at the scenic Granlibakken Conference Center & Lodge,
which is nestled between trees, mountains, and Squaw
and Alpine Ski Resorts. The Reno-Tahoe International
Airport provides ready access to Lake Tahoe.
The all-inclusive meeting package of $799.00 (single-
occupancy) or $608.00 (double occupancy) includes
conference registration fees, three nights lodging

Special Workshop: Synthesizing Ecology and Evolution
for the Study of Invasive Species
Organizers: Carol Lee, Kristina Schierenbeck,

mywebspace.wisc.edu/carollee/web/Lee/ Invasion-
BiologyWorkshop.html
We have organized this workshop to promote integra-
tion of ecological and evolutionary perspectives and ap-
proaches toward the study of invasive species. Our aim
is to create a venue in which discussion among partici-
pants would lead to novel synthetic research and papers
that reﬂect the novel syntheses. For example, the inte-
gration of population genetics and population dynamics
could yield insights into the lag period of invasions, evo-lutionary responses to novel environments, and range
expansions, oscillations, and extinctions. Also, inte-
grating empirical data on ecological factors, such as
predation or competition, with genetic factors, such as
quantitative genetic variance or the genomic architec-
ture of critical traits, could enhance our understand-
ing on factors that limit invasions and improve the ef-
ﬁcacy of predictive models, including those that might
aid in biological control. Invasive species provide an
ideal testing ground for many basic evolutionary theo-
ries, and we hope that this workshop will help expand
this potential.
This event will be held March 19-22, 2009 at
Granlibakken Lodge, North Lake Tahoe, California,
USA. The workshop will consist of talks by invited
speakers (listed below), group discussions, and posters
sessions. Papers resulting from the workshop will be
submitted to the journal Evolutionary Applications for
a special issue.

summer
Undergraduate research experience at the Summer
School of Molecular Evolutionary Research (the
SoMER school) in Ireland.
The Department of Biology of the National Univer-
sity of Ireland, Mynooth is announcing its second sum-
mer School of Molecular Evolutionary Research (the
SoMER school). Our aim is to provide research training
and expertise to enthusiastic undergraduate students
with a special interest in molecular evolution, and more
generally evolutionary biology.
Every student will be integrated into an active re-
search group at the Department of Biology of the NUI
Maynooth, and will be assigned an individual research
project. A key focus of the school is that every stu-
dent should experience every one of the steps involved
in evolutionary research. The students will thus par-
ticipate in ﬁeld work where they will sample biological
specimens, they will extract and sequence DNA from
the samples they collected, and they will use bioinfor-
matics/computational techniques to analyse the data
they generated.
Other activities will include one day workshops carried
out by members of the Department of Biology and in-
vited external speakers (see our website for details).
The SoMER school will run for ten weeks, starting the
8th of June 2009, and will accept 10 students. It is open
to undergraduate students from every country and na-
tionality. The only requirement is that you must have
a strong interest in evolutionary biology, and an inter-
est in pursing a career in this research area. For every
student, funding will be available in the form of a - 300
per week salary. Travel expenses will also be covered,
up to - 300 for EU students, and up to - 800 for non-EU
students. On-campus, discounted self-catering accom-
modation will be provided for the SoMER students.
The SoMER school will be based in the Department
of Biology of the NUI Maynooth, which is very con-
veniently located in the Irish countryside, only 34 Km
(21 Miles) from Dublin City International Airport, and
28 Km (17 Miles) from Dublin city centre. Maynooth
is very well connected to Dublin through regular train
and bus services.
Maynooth is a picturesque village, which has hosteduniversities and colleges since 1795, and currently hosts
two independent universities: The National University
of Ireland, Maynooth, and a branch of the Pontiﬁcal
University (St. Patrick’s College). Maynooth’s cultur-
ally rich history is reﬂected in the architectural beauty
of the old campus, and if you are a non-Irish student it
is fair to say that Maynooth is probably the ideal place
to carry out a research experience, while experiencing
life in Ireland.
Visit our website http://bioinf.nuim.ie/ureka/ if you
are interested and would like to apply.
Alternatively send us an e-mail: ureka2009@gmail.com
The deadline to apply to the SoMER school is the 6th
of March.

The Workshop on Molecular Evolution has been the
ﬁnest course in the subject since it was started in
1988. The Workshop consists of a series of lectures,
demonstrations and computer laboratories that cover
various aspects of molecular evolution. A distinguish-
ing feature of the Workshop is a well-equipped com-
puter laboratory with Apple Macintosh computers and
servers for comparative analysis of molecular data. Au-
thors and experts in the use of computer programs
and packages such as AWTY, BEAST, Clustal W
and Clustal X, FASTA, FigTree, GARLI, LAMARC,
MAFFT, MrBayes, PAML, PAUP*, and PHYLIP pro-
vide demonstrations and consultations. This two-week
program is designed for established investigators, post-
doctoral fellows, and advanced graduate students with
prior experience in molecular evolution and compara-
tive genomics. Lectures and computer laboratories to-
tal~90 hours of scheduled instruction. An optional
all-computer laboratory of 54+ hours of independent
work with guidance and consultation of some faculty
and teaching assistants is oﬀered during the third week.
Admission is limited and highly competitive, with ad-
missions decisions determined by an international com-
mittee. Many participants ﬁnd the extended topics ses-
sion to be especially useful.
Topics to be covered include:
- Databases and sequence matching: database search-
ing: protein sequence versus protein structure; homol-
ogy; mathematical, statistical, and theoretical aspects
of sequence database searches - Phylogenetic analysis:
theoretical, mathematical and statistical bases; sam-
pling properties of sequence data; Bayesian analysis;
hypothesis testing - Maximum likelihood theory and
practice in phylogenetics and population genetics: coa-
lescent theory; maximum likelihood estimation of pop-
ulation genetic parameters - Molecular evolution inte-
grated at organism and higher levels: population bi-
ology; biogeography; ecology; systematics and conser-112 EvolDir March 1, 2009
vation - Molecular evolution and development: gene
duplication and divergence; gene family organization;
coordinated expression in evolution - Comparative ge-
nomics: genome content; genome structure; genome
evolution - Molecular evolution integrated at lower lev-
els: biochemistry; cell biology; physiology; relationship
of genotype to phenotype
2009 Fees: $2500 (room and board at no additionalcharge), plus an additional $900 for the extended top-
ics session.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
