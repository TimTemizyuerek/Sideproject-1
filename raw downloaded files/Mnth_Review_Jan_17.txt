CONFERENCE OVERVIEW:
The population genomics of fungal and oomycete
pathogens is a rapidly growing area of research. New
datasets, new sequencing methodologies and new an-
alytical methods are enabling a deeper understandingJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 3
of the evolutionary processes driving the emergence of
fungal and oomycete pathogens. This conference aims
to enrich our understanding of the processes driving the
evolution of plant, animal and human pathogens, with
an over-riding goal of identifying the genomic changes
responsible for adaptation to novel hosts and environ-
ments. A secondary goal will be to determine how the
relevant genes (and their underlying functions) vary
along ecological/agronomic gradients associated with
host specialization, including quantitative adaptation to
host resistance. The conference will be oriented around
genome-based approaches, including; 1) using popula-
tion genomics to understand pathogen emergence and
host specialization, 2) using genome-wide association
studies to identify key genes and genomic regions associ-
ated with pathogen local adaptation, 3) using population
genomics to understand pathogen divergence/speciation,
4) developing new analytical methods for population
genomic analyses.

We would like to announce the Ecological Immunology
Workshop 2017 on:
Insect immunity: genomics, microbiome, applications
28th August to 1st September 2017 in Blossin (close to
Berlin), Germany.
This workshop will bring together researchers interested
in ecological immunology with a focus on insects, and
with diverse scientic backgrounds ranging from molecu-
lar biology to ecology. The hallmark of these workshops,
started in 2001, is the open atmosphere fostering free
exchange by keeping it an aordable, small conference
(100 participants). The format consists of eighteen in-
vited speakers, contributed talks and a dedicated poster.January 1, 2017 EvolDir 5
Long breaks provide plenty of opportunity for informal
exchange. Past workshops have initiated new collabo-
rations and ideas focusing on frontier research that has
not been published. The premises are basic but in a
beautiful location conducive to the success of the meet-
ing. We will be located at a lakeside, which at this time
of the year oers great swimming and canoeing, and a
small private bar at the harbour [http://www.blossin.de]

Edinburgh WildlifeForensics Jun5-9
Dear colleagues,
The Society for Wildlife Forensic Science is an interna-
tional organisation promoting the use of forensics in law
enforcement across wildlife crime. I'm writing to draw
your attention to the Society's 2017 meeting that will
be held from 5-9th June in Edinburgh, UK, which may
be of particular interest to Evoldir subscribers working
on population genetics of species involved in the illegal
wildlife trade.
Forensics has been receiving increasing attention within
the wildlife law enforcement community, with inclusion
in numerous high level national and intergovernmental
strategies, as well as the development of new laboratory
facilities around the world.
The meeting will bring together the world's leading
wildlife forensic scientists and includes a special 1-day
International Symposium where we will bring together
Policy, Enforcement and Scientic experts to discuss the
use of forensics in relation to transnational crime, IUU
shing, illegal timer trade and national wildlife crime.
This event will be opened by the Scottish government
Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change
and Land Reform, Ms Roseanna Cunningham, with a
keynote address from the Secretary General of CITES,Mr John Scanlon.
Please visit the website for more information
and to register your attendance (https://-
www.wildlifeforensicscience.org/2017-meeting/),
discounts apply for early registration (until 31st
January 2017). Spread the word to colleagues you think
may be interested in this meeting.
Many thanks,

ESEB Symposium on \EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFI-
CANCE OF BIOLOGICAL CLOCKS"
Dear Colleagues,
we would like to invite you to attend or contribute to
the ESEB symposium
[S6] Evolutionary signicance of biological clocks at the
16th Congress of the European Society for Evolution-
ary Biology (ESEB), in Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25
August 2017.
INVITED SPEAKERS: Steven Reppert ( University of
Massachusetts) Takashi Yoshimura ( Nagoya University)
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Biological clocks are
found in almost all organisms and have evolved inde-
pendently many times, suggesting they must convey
considerable adaptive value. The adaptive value may
lie in (1) optimizing energy expenditure in a world full
of regular environmental changes, such as seasons, night
and day and tides, (2) synchronizing reproduction within
populations or with suitable environmental conditions
or (3) escaping predation. In surprisingly few casesJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 7
the adaptive value of biological clocks has been demon-
strated experimentally. However, there are a number
of examples where local adaptation of biological clocks
to environmental clines (e.g. latitudinal temperature
clines) gives indirect evidence for the adaptive value of
biological clocks. These cases often also allow to study
the evolutionary forces shaping biological clocks and
their target clock molecules. Our symposium will be
open to all evolutionary aspects of biological timekeep-
ing - from seasonal over diel to tidal and lunar rhythms.
We would like to showcase demonstrations of adaptive
values of biological clocks, but also oer a platform
for all other topics at the intersection of evolution and
biological timekeeping. We aim to initiate discussion
among evolutionary biologists and chronobiologists, in
order increase mutual understanding and to foster the
thinking about biological clocks in evolutionary terms.

mit abstracts online at http://www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-

tion strategies are at the core of consumer-resource
interactions: herbivores exploit plants, predators exploit
prey, and parasites exploit their hosts. Most theory on
the evolution of exploitation strategies has concentrated
on host-parasite interactions, modelling for example the
virulence-transmission trade-o or within-host competi-
tion between strains with dierent exploitation strate-
gies. However, this theory has rarely been applied to
other antagonistic interactions, such as plant-herbivore
or predator-prey interactions.
Recently, empirical work has made important progress in
identifying exploitation strategies outside host-parasite
systems. Herbivores, for example, not only express re-
sistance to plant defence, but have now been shown
to exploit their host through suppression of defence
in many systems. Within a community context, these
exploitation strategies have profoundly dierent con-
sequences: resistance aects competition with other
herbivores and apparent competition through natural
enemies, but suppression and induction of plant de-
fences directly aect food quality for others, such as kin,
competitors and even natural enemies. Given that sup-
pression of plant defences also benets other community
members, how could this exploitation strategy evolve?
This symposium aims to bring together empiricists and
theoreticians working on antagonistic coevolution in
parasite-host, predator-prey and plant-herbivore sys-
tems, addressing the evolution of exploitation strategies
in antagonistic ecological interactions.

Dear All,
Abstract submission is open for our symposium: \[S22]
Coevolution of hosts and their microbiome" planned for

Deadline for abstract submission : 10th January 2017.
http://www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-abstracts/abstract-
guidelines-/ Abstract:
The evolution of life-history traits in plants and ani-
mals has taken place in the midst of complex microbial
communities. Biology is undergoing a fundamental re-
shaping where the phenotypic expression of individuals
needs to be considered as the combined expression of the
host and its associated microbial genomes, dened as
the \holobiont" (i.e. the host and its microbiota). These
concepts have wide ranging implications and have led
to the realization that multicellular organisms coevolve
with their microbial symbionts. Although host-microbe
interactions can be understood by ecological processes,
much less is known about the signicance of evolution-
ary and eco-evolutionary processes. Given its complex
structure, understanding the specic roles, adaptabil-
ity, and functions provided by the microbiome is a new
scientic frontier. Recent developments in molecular
and statistical techniques have given holobiont studies
new impetus by allowing researchers to address novel
questions. We aim to discuss theoretical concepts and
empirical evidences on the role of the microbiota in
holobiont evolution. Specically: 1) How do microbiota
shape the holobiont phenotypic traits and their plastic-
ity? 2) Do we have evidence for coevolutionary processes
shaping the evolution of holobionts? 3) How can selec-
tion shape the evolution of the collective genomes of a
holobiont (the \hologenome")?

Symposium description
[S24] Eco-evolutionary dynamics
In recent years, the scientic community has embraced
the fact that evolutionary change can occur at ecological
time scales and thereby interact with ongoing ecolog-
ical dynamics. While theoreticians are exploring new
ways to simultaneously account for ecological and evo-
lutionary dynamics (e.g. demographic models, fast-slow
dynamics), empiricists are investigating the drivers of
eco-evolutionary feedbacks (e.g. environmental varia-
tion, evolutionary history, phenotypic plasticity, and
community structure). To advance this \newest syn-
thesis", we bring together theoreticians and empiricists
focusing on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of biologicalJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 9
interactions across three levels of biological organiza-
tion: 1) interactions among coexisting individuals with
alternative life-history strategies, including personali-
ties and tactics; 2) interspecic interactions, including
host-parasite, prey-predator and symbiotic interactions;
and 3) interactions between phenotypic variation and
community or ecosystem characteristics. We invite con-
tributions on eco-(co)evolutionary dynamics providing
mechanistic, empirical and theoretical insights into eco-
evolutionary feedback loops. In this way, the sympo-
sium will aim to advance conceptual understanding of
eco-evolutionary dynamics in coevolution, speciation
and life-history evolution. In addition to the invited
speakers (Jen Schweitzer and Jonathan Pruitt), we have
also invited Isabel Smallegange and Andrew Hendry to
contribute to the symposium.

http://www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-abstracts/abstract-

theory, with a long history in mathematics and
computer science, is starting to play an exciting role in
evolutionary biology across multiple levels of biological
organization, from cellular to ecological systems. Rele-
vant and timely examples include: the study of diseases
as perturbations in complex intracellular networks
rather than single-gene abnormalities (Barabasi 2011),
the spatial and functional interactions of microbial
communities over time (Baldassano & Bassett, 2016),
epidemic outbreaks in animal networks (Shrestha 2015,
Lofgren 2014), and dynamic interactions between
large-scale neural circuits (Shi Gu, 2015, Bassett 2011),
to name only a few. This symposium will bring together
scientists working at the interface of network science
and evolutionary biology with two primary aims: (1) to
highlight the empirical and theoretical advances made
by applying network topology and dynamics theory
to biological data and evolutionary questions, and
(2) to discuss the design of new evolutionary network
models and the integration of network theory with
classic evolutionary models to answer fundamental
questions in biology. As methodologies evolve, greater
scientic interaction at the interface of network theory
and biological systems will be essential for predicting
temporal, spatially embedded, multi-scale networked
evolutionary systems and establishing an integrative
approach to evolutionary population dynamics and
disease.

their environment. Hence adaptation to an environment
is highly inuenced by the abiotic environment as well
as the social interactions with community members. Ex-
perimental evolution provides a superb approach for
studying how social as well as abiotic environmental
interactions aect the adaptation to novel and hetero-
geneous environments. In addition, it aids our under-
standing of the intricate connection between the abiotic
environment, the individual organisms and their com-

structure signicantly inuences the evolution of social
interactions that could resolve in cooperation, mutualis-

sium at ESEB 2017: \Fitness and evolution in a social
environment: from theory to reality"
at the 16th Congress of the European Society for Evo-
lutionary Biology to be held in Groningen, The Nether-

sub/s9-tness-and-evolution-in-a-socia/ Symposium
Summary
Summary: An individual's tness will be shaped bymultiple aspects of social interactions, including eects
of competitive interactions, parental care and parent-
ospring conict, cooperative breeding and inbreeding.
Because variation in tness is the raw ingredient that
drives natural selection and consequent evolution, how
best to measure it in social environments poses a critical
challenge for evolutionary biology. This challenge has
been approached dierently by dierent elds. Social
evolution theory has well-developed models of inclusive
tness, but these often assume simplied genetic un-
derpinnings. Recent advances in quantitative genetics
have explored indirect genetic eects of con-specics on
phenotypic diversity, but the implications of variation in
inclusive tness for evolutionary dynamics are unclear.
Analyses of life-history trait variation reveal dierent
selection pressures if tness is assessed by contributions
across multiple generations, again with complex impli-
cations. Wish this symposium we hope to encourage
integrated conceptual and empirical means of estimating
tness that bring together currently disparate subelds.
The symposium will showcase recent advances in under-
standing variation in tness, and resulting evolution, in
social environments. Specically we aim to: (1) stim-
ulate discussion and communication between theoreti-
cians and empiricists working on a diversity of systems;
(2) evaluate alternative methods for measuring tness;
and (3) illustrate the causes and consequences of varia-
tion in tness in social environments for evolutionary
dynamics.

Fitness landscapes, big data and the predictability of
evolution
Evolutionary biology has become increasingly powerful
in inferring past evolutionary processes from patterns
in present-day genomes. However, forecasting evolu-
tion's future routes remains an exciting intellectual chal-
lenge with substantial implications for global health
and species conservation. The concept of the tness
landscape has been central to recent studies of the pre-
dictability of evolution, and has inspired evolutionary bi-
ologists and mathematicians alike. Combining microbial
experimental evolution with next-generation sequencing,
eorts have now been made to rigorously test for the
repeatability and dynamics of evolution. At the same
time, theoretical studies try to provide the necessary
navigational tools for exploring the terra incognita of
molecular evolutionary biology. This symposium aims
to identify the key issues and challenges { both method-
ological and theoretical - to advance our understanding
of the predictability of evolution, particularly in the
light of \big data". We anticipate that insights from
our symposium will stimulate and direct future studies
of the predictability of evolution. With next-generation
sequencing on board, tness landscapes are heading for
new shores: It's now time to check whether \there be
dragons"!

Abstract submission is open for our symposium: '[S19]
Evolution of gene expression regulation' planned for the
*European Society for Evolutionary Biology meeting in
Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25th August, 2017. *
http://www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-abstracts/abstract-
guidelines-/ More than four decades have passed since
it was rst suggested that gene expression regulation
variation could play a signicant role in the phenotypic
divergence between chimpanzees and humans. Ever
since, there has been an impressive and fruitful eort to
characterize the molecular basis of regulatory variation
within and between species. However, until recently,
'regulatory variation' has been used synonymously
with 'dierences in mRNA levels'. In recent years,
though, new high-throughput sequencing technologies
have oered us a window into fundamental questions
about the evolution of post-transcriptional dynamics.
With the introduction of methods such as ribosome
proling (RiboSeq) and mass spectroscopy (mass-spec),
we can now measure post-transcriptional regulation in
a variety of dierent conditions. These technologies are
now being used to study questions from how regulatory
variation evolves within and between species. Moreover,
there exist exciting avenues in applying these methods
to microbial evolution experiments to study how gene
expression regulation evolves during adaptation. Other
examples include new methods and insights into the
evolutionary role of non-coding RNAs, which have been
uncovered as key regulators of gene expression at the
post-transcriptional level, or the evolution of protein
post-translational modications that can inuence their
function, activity or stability. Together, these studies
have given us unprecedented insight into the evolution
of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
This symposium will bring together researchers that
develop and employ high-throughput, quantitative12 EvolDir January 1, 2017

the goal of understanding the molecular landscape of
complex phenotypes.

GenomicsOfAdaptation Aug20-25
Dear All,
We would like to invite abstract submissions for our
upcoming symposium on the Genomics of Adaptation
that will take place as part of the 16th Congress of the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB). The
conference will take place from August 20th - August
25th, 2017 in Groningen, the Netherlands.
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Genomics of Adapta-
tion [S16] Model organisms for life-history research are
mainly studied in the lab where functional genetics is
assessable. In general, however, knowledge about their
eco-evolutionary dynamics, such as biotic interactions,
is rare. By contrast, in organisms for which the ecology
and adaptation strategies in the eld are well known,
we typically lack the appropriate genetic tools to investi-
gate functionality. Advances in genomics and statistics
as well as investments in evolutionary model organisms
are now providing access to putatively adaptive genome-
wide variation within species from across the tree of life.
In this symposium, we focus on integrating life-history
biology, genetics and evolutionary ecology in the ge-
nomics era. We wish to (1) highlight the role of genetic
architecture of complex traits, such as adaptations to
biotic interactions or life-history traits; (2) contrast this
to morphological traits which are generally thought to
have a less complex genetic architecture; and (3) dis-
cuss the opportunities and drawbacks of specic model
systems.

Dear colleagues:
We would like to invite you to contribute to and/or

\ Evolution across the mutualist-parasite continuum "
[S31]
which will take place at the 16th Congress of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in
Groningen, The Netherlands, 20-25 August 2017.
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
Symbioses, and other close-knit species relationships, are
ubiquitous and important across all ecosystems. Such
species interactions vary widely, from costly relation-
ships which drive rapid antagonistic coevolution, to ben-
ecial relationships which facilitate functional diversi-
cation. Rather than two extremes however, these inter-
actions should be viewed as a continuum between mutu-
alism and parasitism. This conceptual framework unites
researchers studying host-parasite and host-mutualist
interactions and explores the potential for transitions
along the continuum. Our topic is timely and relevant
to the ESEB community. It has broad evolutionary rele-
vance for which many new insights have been generated
in the last few years. This symposium will bring to-
gether researchers studying the evolution of parasitism
and mutualism to: 1) highlight the role of these speciesJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 13
interactions in shaping an organism's evolutionary biol-
ogy; 2) emphasize the importance of linking phenotypic
and state-of-the-art genomics analysis in revealing these
eects; 3) bring together experimental evolution and
eld-based approaches in studying evolution across the
continuum and 4) assess the role of ecology in shaping
the evolutionary stability of these systems. Many im-
portant concepts in evolutionary biology will be covered,
from coevolution, genetic diversity, virulence, and sex,
to ecological networks. Our invited speakers are at the
forefront of research on both sides of the continuum
and use natural systems while combining genomics and
experimental evolution approaches.

INVITED SPEAKERS: Prof. Brandon Gaut (Univer-

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: It is now well known
that rapid evolution and adaptation to new environ-
ments is not solely driven by variation at chromosomal
gene loci, but that it is also inuenced by various cytonu-
clear factors and by non-genetic inheritance. Epigenetic
modications and cytoplasmic elements can directly
aect morphological, physiological and behavioural phe-
notypic variation across generations. Also, transpos-
able elements that are ubiquitous sequences in virtu-
ally all genomes may have a strong impact on host
gene regulation, which could be mediated by epigenetic
modications. The interaction between transposable
elements, epigenetics and the environment may consid-
erably increase the degree of phenotypic variation in
natural populations, thus allowing for rapid local adap-
tation. Yet, the mechanisms underlying non-genetic
inheritance and the eects of epigenetic modications
by transposable elements remain unclear. This sympo-
sium will bring together theoreticians and empiricists
who are interested in the interplay of environmental
factors, transposable elements, cytoplasmic components
and transgenerational epigenetic changes. The aim is to
better understand the nature of transposable elements
and non-genetic inheritance and their impact on evo-

is crucial to address fundamental questions in evolution-
ary biology. Empiricists have greatly benetted from
the continual ease of generating sequence data for phy-
logenetic inference and can now employ genome-scale
datasets to infer the evolutionary history of clades across
the tree of life. However, the availability of large phy-
logenomic datasets are not a panacea for all phylogenetic
issues and these large datasets often present new chal-
lenges. In particular, individual genetic markers can
have discordant phylogenetic histories due to processesJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 15
such as incomplete lineage sorting, introgression and se-
lection, potentially clouding the inference of organismal
relationships. Most contemporary species tree estima-
tion methods aim to model observed incongruence using
the multi-species coalescent but these approaches often
assume incomplete lineage sorting as the single source
of discord and are computationally exhaustive or rely
on the precision of individual gene trees. The devel-
opment of novel approaches to account for sources of
phylogenetic incongruence therefore remains a thriving
area of research. Given the vigorous state of the eld, it
is thus timely to discuss recent advances and remaining
challenges of species tree estimation in a symposium
where we invite both theoreticians and empiricists.

Groningen ESEB RapidEvol
Aug20-25
Dear Colleagues,
We extend an invitation to our upcoming ESEB 2017
[S23] symposium entitled Rapid Evolution Revisited.
The symposium will take place at the 16th Congress of
the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB),
in Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25 August 2017.
The deadline for abstract submission is 10 January 2017.
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Times are changing,
and our studies in evolutionary biology must change
along with it. Many studies now demonstrate that nat-
ural populations can evolve at ecological timescales (i.e.
across a few generations), which is particularly evident
in adaptation to environmental change. At the same
time, some of the best model systems to study evolu-
tion in action have demonstrated that predicting the
magnitude and direction of evolution from estimatesof selection is less than straightforward. The increased
availability of genomic and long-term data in non-model
organisms, and novel advances in statistical and techno-
logical methods, can provide new solutions to this puzzle.
These advances acknowledge that our ability to predict
evolution in natural populations can be improved by
considering determinants of the whole phenotype (from
genetic and plastic to transgenerational and epigenetic
eects), and also eco-evolutionary feedback processes.
Yet in many systems these novel frameworks and tools
remain under-used. The goal of this symposium is to
synthesize these into a more integrative framework for
the study of evolution in nature; a timely topic given
the pressing challenge of predicting responses to global
environmental change. .

Jyvaskyla), Andres Lopez-Sepulcre (CNRS-Universite

symposium exploring the causes and consequences of
variation in recombination rate in sexually reproducing
organisms.

SPEAKERS: Abraham Korol, University of Haifa, Is-
rael. (http://evolution.haifa.ac.il/index.php/people/-

hannes Kelper University, Germany. (http://-
www.jku.at/biophysics/content/e54633/e97350/)
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Recombination is para-
doxical, it can create novel genetic combinations that
natural selection can act on, and thus facilitate adapta-
tion, but it can also break apart favourable combinations
of alleles. In addition, recombination can play a critical
role during meiosis, with recombination events regu-16 EvolDir January 1, 2017
lated to ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes.
Thus, tight regulation of recombination is expected,
but variable rates of recombination may be favoured
in dierent environments or contexts. While the role
of recombination in the evolution of sex has been the
focus of much empirical and theoretical work, investiga-
tion on how conicting selection pressures are resolved,
how recombination rate evolves, and what impact this
has on evolutionary processes within sexually repro-
ducing organisms has received less attention. Recent
advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics has
provided unprecedented opportunities to characterise
variation in recombination rate. Now is a pertinent time
to highlight (i) rapidly developing approaches to esti-
mate recombination rate in the genomics era and (ii) our
growing understanding of the causes and consequences
of variation in recombination rates; including how re-
combination rate variation responds to selection, how
recombination varies between individuals, sexes, popu-
lations, species and in response to the environment, and
how recombination inuences the processes of speciation
and adaptation.

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
The deadline for abstract submission is 10 January 2017.
Submit abstracts online at http://www.eseb2017.nl/-
call-for-abstracts/ SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
Although dispersal is one of the four mechanisms of evo-
lutionary change, the explicit spatial context in which
evolution occurs is frequently ignored. In addition, the
dynamics of dispersal are important as well, as the abil-
ity to disperse itself may rapidly evolve and is subject to
eco-evolutionary feedbacks. A particularly potent tool
for elucidating spatial evolution is genomic data, which
can be used to accurately assess (ne-scale) spatial ge-
netic variation. Together with an improved understand-
ing of spatial evolution, this helps us better understand
applied processes such as biogeography, climate-change
related range shifts, biological invasions and the spread
of disease. Our symposium provides a platform for biol-
ogists studying evolution in a spatial context. We invite
contributions from theory, experiments and compara-
tive work considering all levels of organization, from
individuals to communities, and particularly encourage
studies incorporating multiple approaches. We will show-
case the diversity of approaches (statistical approaches,
modelling, experimental evolution, genetics, spatially
informed genomics) as well as model and non-model
organisms used in the study of spatial evolution (frommicrobes to vertebrates and digital organisms). This
inclusive approach is a major precondition for promot-
ing interaction and reaching synthesis in this quickly
advancing eld and designing future research avenues.

Italy Speciation Feb19-24
The full program is now available for SPECIATION
2017, a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) dedicated
exclusively to speciation research:
https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=16903 The
conference - the world's largest of its kind - will be
held at the Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort &
Spa in Italy during the week of February 19-24, 2017.
For the rst time, the conference will be preceded by a
two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), co-chaired by
Amanda Hund and Laurel Symes, which oers unique
opportunities for graduate students and early-careerscientists to learn and get involved at the forefronts of
modern speciation research.
The GRC conferences on speciation raise to a trans-
Atlantic level a tradition of international conferences on
speciation research that was initiated by the European
Research Networking Programme 'Frontiers of Speci-
ation Research'. The three conferences held thus far,
in 2010, 2013, and 2015, have helped facilitate bridge-
building between disparate approaches to speciation
research and have attracted hundreds of participants
from all facets of speciation research.
Registration for SPECIATION 2017 will continue until
the venue's capacity is lled. At the time of writing, we
can make only a few additional acceptances before we
have to waitlist applicants so please apply soon if you
are hoping to join us.

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
13th ANNUAL EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS SYM-
POSIUM
Ecology and evolutionary biology of phenotypic plastic-
ity
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Michigan invites nominations of out-
standing scientists early in their careers to participate in
an exciting international symposium about the ecology
and evolutionary biology of phenotypic plasticity. The
symposium events will take place from 10-12th of March
2017, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Eight early career scientists, alongside a keynote speaker,
will be selected to present their work and to participate
in panel discussions. We welcome nominations of early
career scientists who are studying topics in ecology and
evolution related to phenotypic plasticity. This sympo-
sium will highlight the work of up-and-coming scientists
whose research foci span a breadth of subelds and levels
of organization. We champion diversity and encourage
the nomination of members of groups underrepresented
in science.
Early career scientists are considered senior graduate
students (who stand to receive their Ph.D. within one
year), postdoctoral researchers, and rst- or second-
year faculty. A colleague or advisor must provide the
nomination.
The nomination consists of a brief letter of recommenda-
tion addressing the nominee's scientic promise and abil-
ity to give a compelling talk, the nominee's curriculum
vitae, and a brief abstract of the proposed presentation
(<200 words, written by the nominee). Nominations
may be sent electronically (in one le, please) to eeb-
ecss-nomination@umich.edu using the nominee's name
as the subject line (last name rst). Information about
Early Career Scientist Symposia held in past years canbe found at http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/ecss/ . Review
of nominations will begin on December 31, 2016.
Selected participants will be contacted in mid January
and will have all expenses covered
(registration, travel and accommodation). An ocial
announcement of the slate of speakers will be issued
soon thereafter.

Vienna EvolutionaryEpigenetics
Sep12-15
Dear all
Registration has opened for the 40th New Phytologist
symposium on the topic \Plant epigenetics: from mech-
anisms to ecological relevance" to be held in Vienna,
Austria, 12-15 Sept 2017.
Plant epigenetics has recently become a compelling re-
search eld. For an ecient integration of epigenetics in
ecological and biodiversity research, an interdisciplinary
and continuous ux of information is necessary, together
with close cooperation between related disciplines. To
this end, this symposium focuses on interdisciplinary dis-
cussion and aims to foster cooperation among research
groups.
The symposium format will include six non-concurrent
sessions on the following topics: Session 1: Population
epigenomics in natural systems Session 2: Epigenetic
regulation of plant phenotypes Session 3: Transgen-January 1, 2017 EvolDir 23
erational inheritance of epigenetic patterns Session 4:
Epigenetic regulation as a response to changes in envi-
ronmental conditions Session 5: Epigenetic regulation
of biotic interactions Session 6: Bioinformatic analysis
for plant epigenetics
Twenty-ve leading scientists are invited to speak at the
symposium. We hope that this will stimulate focused
discussion and the exchange of ideas at what will be
a relatively small (around 120 delegates) and informal
meeting. There will be also several selected talks and
poster sessions. As the symposium benets from gener-
ous support from New Phytologist and the symposium
venue is provided by the University of Vienna, registra-tion rates are low (120 for students and 240 for regular
registration) and include lunches, coee breaks, evening
receptions, conference dinner, a tour of the Botanical
Garden and a nostalgic tram tour through Vienna.
Places are limited, so please register early to avoid dis-
appointment. The registration will close as soon as
the maximum number of participants is reached. Ab-
stract submission will remain open to 13 July 2017.

BrookesU GeneDuplicateEvolution
Title of the project: Early Evolution of Gene Duplicates
Key words: gene duplication, gene dosage, gene regula-
tion, CRISPR/Cas9, 4C-seq
Gene duplication is a major evolutionary mechanism
leading to novel gene function and phenotypic diversity.
However, very little is known about the period shortly
after the duplication event. Molecular evolution studies
suggest that gene dosage is an important contributory
factor in determining whether new duplicates become
xed or not. However, in metazoans this evidence is
largely based on statistical inference based on extant
population data.
In this project, we aim to test the eect of gene dosage
on the fate of new gene duplicates in an experimen-
tal framework using Drosophila melanogaster. The re-
search project student will generate tandem gene du-
plications, deletions and non-functional mutants using
the CRISPR/Cas9 system and other transgenic tools to
target both genes likely to result in genes with dosage-
sensitive functions as well as genes that are expected
to display less sensitivity to dosage. The eect of the
newly generated transgenic alleles will be measured by
conducting tness assays and functional genomics to
quantify transcription (qPCR, RNAseq) and enhancer
interactions (4C-seq).

We are searching for a highly motivated scientist that

approach (DNA barcoding, microsatellites and next
generation sequencing) in the framework of the interdis-
ciplinary project
*Refugia and Ecosystem Tolerance in the Southern
Ocean (RECTO).*
Because of its long history and geographic isolation,
the Southern Ocean (SO) provides a natural labora-
tory for research on evolution and biodiversity. Con-
fronted with fast-paced environmental changes, biota
in Antarctic ecosystems are strongly challenged and
face three possible outcomes: adaptation, migration or
extinction. Past glaciation periods have already forced
marine zoobenthos of the SO into refugia, being either
ice-free continental shelf areas, the deep sea or sub- or
peri-Antarctic regions, followed by recolonization when
the ice retreated. In a multidisciplinary approach and
involving all major Belgian research groups studying
evolution and diversity of SO faunas, RECTO will strive
at understanding how such past events have driven di-
versication and adaptation in dierent animal groups
and how these can be applied as proxies to understand
the contemporary situation and predict future scenarios.
The Marine Biology Lab at the VUB specialises in re-
search on molecular ecology of marine fauna from the
poles to the tropics and from invertebrates to shes. In
the new collaborative research project RECTO the evo-
lutionary history of Antarctic sea stars will be studied.

PhD and MSc position in Evolution of sex chromosomes
in squamate reptiles
Two positions for a PhD and a MSc candidate is cur-
rently open in the research team of Dr. Lukas Kratochvil,
Department of Ecology, Charles University, Czech Re-
public. The successful candidates will join our current
projects on the study of the evolution of sex chromo-
somes in squamate reptiles with molecular and cytoge-
netic methods.
Project description: The aim of the project is to ex-
amine the evolution of sex chromosomes and their ho-
mology based on gene content in selected lineages of
squamate reptiles (eg. lizards and snakes). Squamate
reptiles possess lineages with either XX/XY, ZZ/ZW
or temperature-dependent sex determination. Despite
the recent advances in the eld, our knowledge about
their sex determination systems and sex chromosome
homology is limited only to few groups of reptiles (eg.
iguanas, advanced snakes), while the majority of reptil-
ian lineages remain unstudied. The successful candidate
will collaborate with the other team members and will
study the evolution of sex chromosomes in a multidi-
rectional approach, involving cytogenetics (eg. FISH,
chromosome painting), molecular genetics (eg. qPCR)
and bioinformatics (eg. transcriptomics). More informa-
tion about our current research activity can be found
in the following publications:

Qualications: For PhD candidates, the applicant
should possess Master degree (or equivalent title) and
has a proven expertise in a related eld of biology:
evolutionary biology, cytogenetics, phylogenetics,
genomics and/or bioinformatics. Previous experience
in herpetology is not necessary. The ideal candidate
should be scientically motivated, able to work bothJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 29

CzechRepublic PlantCytogenetics
For the project \Repeatome dynamics in the earliest
evolutionary stages of apomictic plants", funded by the
Czech Science Foundation, we seek to the earliest possi-
ble date a highly motivated
PhD student in Cytogenetics
The project (duration 3 years) is aimed at a better un-
derstanding of mechanisms underlying the transition
from sexual to apomictic reproduction. Apomixis is
tightly connected with hybridization and polyploidiza-
tion. Despite a great potential in agriculture, the genetic
mechanisms of apomixis are still poorly understood.
Hybridization causes genetic instability including a re-
structuring of the repeatome, the fastest evolving part
of plant genomes. Bursts of transposable elements due
to hybridization-induced genomic shock may trigger a
switch to apomixis. In the project, sexual and apomictic
Hieracium species will be investigated in an extensive
breeding program, comparing articial hybrids with
natural apomicts of the same parentage as a model of
hybrid speciation that may lead to the formation of
apomictic lineages.
An interdisciplinary and international team
of researchers from the Institute of Botany
(www.ibot.cas.cz/en/) of the Czech Academy of
Sciences and the Department of Botany of the Charles
University in Prague (www.cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html)
will tackle this complex biological question from
various angles (cytogenetics, genomics, embryology,
reproductive biology).
Responsibilities of the PhD candidate include karyotyp-
ing of plants, in situ hybridization (FISH, GISH) with a
main focus on the localization of parental-specic repet-
itive elements using probes derived from NGS data as
cytogenetic markers to investigate genome repatterning
following hybridization. Further tasks include data pro-
cessing and interpretation, presentations at international
conferences and publications in IF journals.
Experience with karyological and cytological techniques,
preferably in plants, is desired. The candidate should
have an excellent command of English. Personal features32 EvolDir January 1, 2017
should include reliability, patience, technical accuracy,
exibility, good social skills and the readiness to learn.
We oer creative work, the chance for personal
development, a pleasant working atmosphere in a
marvellous environment (Pruhonice Park, UNESCO
World Heritage Site, www.pruhonickypark.cz/en/the-
pruhonice-park/), and an excellent infrastructure at the

Ph.D. scholarship available Deakin University; Centre
for Integrative Ecology, Geelong, Vic Australia Stress,
song and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
Although the transgenerational eects of early life
stress have been well documented in a variety of non
model organisms, the underlying mechanisms are un-
clear. The PhD student will join a supervisory team
of Australian Research Council Future Fellow Profes-
sor Kate Buchanan, Professor Andy TD Bennett & Dr
Ondi Crino, who are seeking an outstanding, highly
motivated PhD candidate. Previous work has demon-
strated the fundamental impact of early life stressors
on vocal learning in songbirds. The aim of this PhD
research is to assess the extent to which such eects
occur across generations and test the possible mecha-
nisms for transgenerational eects using Zebra Finches
as a model systems. The PhD student will work with
experimentally bred generation of wild-derived zebra
nches in captivity, but opportunities for eld work on
wild populations of zebra nches in arid Australia arealso available.
The PhD student will be in a vibrant and productive
research team. They will test the role of early devel-
opmental stress for song learning, neural development
and behaviour. They will conduct behavioural tests,
bioacoustics analyses, neural sectioning and image brain
sections for gene expression. Fundamentally the student
will test whether early developmental conditions impose
inherited inuence on cognition, by assessing vocal learn-
ing in birds arising from control and developmentally
stressed parents.
Start date: from March 2017 onwards Stipend:
AUD $26,000 p.a. (tax exempt) for 3 years (for non-
Australian/NZ citizens waivers to overseas tuition fee
are potentially available)
It will build on our recent research, featured in the inter-
national leading journal Science, (and reported widely
including The ABC Science Show, BBC, Smithsonian,
New York Times) which showed transgenerational eects
in zebra nches of singing to eggs. Check out https://-
www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDg67kUPAc PhD Project
content: The student will join a productive ARC-funded
team testing the eect of early life stress on vocal learn-
ing, neural development and behaviour. The student
will have responsibility for carrying out behavioural play-
back experiments, recording and analysing avian song,
collecting neural tissue and imaging the brain for gene
expression. They will receive training in all these as-
pects, and as the research will involve collaboration with
the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany,
travel there may be possible. Although the project has
clear aims to meet the project objectives, we seek a
student who is keen to develop their own interests and
so nd their own individual niche within the project.

provide a full tuition fee waiver, a competitive living
stipend, and a considerable research allowance. For
more information about these projects and how to ap-
ply see https://sites.google.com/site/andreannajwelch/-
jointhelab/ phd-studentship-opportunities or contact Dr.
Andreanna Welch at a.j.welch@durham.ac.uk. Only the
best applicants will be asked to submit a full application.
Durham University is consistently rated as one of the
top 100 universities in the world. Located in northeast
England, the university is situated in a scenic town and
lies within a 15-minute train ride of the thriving city
of Newcastle. The department of Biosciences oers a
supportive research-driven environment with projects
ranging from the cellular to the ecosystem level.
AVAILABLE PROJECTS:
1) Reconstructing the evolutionary history of ecological
dynamics and extinction risk in seabirdsDuring their evolutionary history, birds have only rarely
colonized the open oceans beyond the continental shelves.
The Procellariiformes (albatrosses, shearwaters, storm-
petrels, etc.) are by far the largest and most diverse
group of oceanic birds, but their molecular phylogeny
is poorly known. As part of an international collab-
oration, the student will use capture enrichment and
next generation sequencing methods to collect a rich
genomic dataset and resolve the phylogeny of all extant
and recently extinct Procellariiformes, at and below the
species level. This will advance our understanding of the
evolution of oceanic avian predators, allow exploration
of the role of ecology in the process of diversication,
and inform conservation management of this globally-
threatened group. Beyond this, the theory, methods,
and skills learned while completing this project will be
widely applicable and prepare the student for future
success in academic, research, and non-governmental
positions.
Eligibility: All nationalities Letters of interest should be
received by 2 January 2017 If invited, full applications
(including 2 reference letters) are due 9 January 2017
2) Using ancient DNA to uncover historical disease dy-
namics in North American and British deer
Diseases can have dramatic impacts by limiting popula-
tion growth rates, producing strong selection pressures,
and potentially leading to adaptive responses. While
not infective to humans, chronic wasting disease (CWD)
is a fatal disease in cervids (deer, elk, and moose). Anal-
yses of the underlying Prnp gene suggest that particular
alleles may inuence susceptibility through decreased
infection rates and/or slower disease progression. We
will use ancient DNA techniques to examine changes
in the frequencies of Prnp alleles through time in two
deer species, European red deer (Cervus elaphus) and
closely related North American elk (Cervus canaden-
sis). For work on elk, the student will travel to the
US and be hosted in the lab of our collaborator for
three moths to study both infected and non-infected
populations. While CWD is not currently present in
the UK, evidence suggests that similar diseases may
have inuenced populations of red deer in the past, and
investigation of contemporary populations will provide
insights into current susceptibility, should CWD spread
to the UK. Thus the student will have multiple oppor-
tunities to interface with UK governmental agencies
working to prevent the spread of CWD to Britain.
Eligibility: UK citizens and EU citizens who have
resided in the UK >3 years Letters of interest should be
received by 9 January 2017 If invited, full applications
(including 2 reference letters) are due 16 January 2017
3) Evolutionary insights for engineering improved globin34 EvolDir January 1, 2017
oxygen carriers
Around 2 million red blood cell units at a cost of 120
GBP per unit are transfused annually in England alone.
These costs, together with a shortage of donors and
inherent infection risks have led to the drive for the
development of articial, haem-based oxygen carriers.
Our previous research has identied diving mammals
as a natural model system for the study of biochemi-
cal/biophysical factors that allow greatly increased ex-
pression yields of the oxygen-binding protein myoglobin,
a prototype for the development of haem-based oxygen
carriers. This large-scale evolutionary, bioinformatics
and phylogenetic analysis has revealed multiple conver-
gent pathways to increased protein expression capacity
by an order of magnitude in several mammalian lin-
eages. These were associated with distinct increases
in myoglobin net surface charge that presumably in-
hibit protein aggregation by electrostatic repulsion. We
have since identied multiple convergent increases in
myoglobin folding stability as another correlate of

DurhamU UngulatePhylogeography
NERC PhD studentship available at Durham Univer-
sity (in collaboration with the British Geological Survey
and the Natural History Museum) - full funding for UK
nationals only:
Phylogeography of European ungulates from the last
interglacial period and their subsequent evolution.
This project will involve ancient DNA and next genera-
tion sequencing to explore the genetic diversity of deer
and other ungulates from the Eemian interglacial period,
~120,000 years ago. A key aspect of the study will be
the integration of environmental data (including stable
isotope analyses in collaboration with the British Geolog-
ical Survey), so that any changes in demography or dis-
tribution can be interpreted in the context of changing
environments. The studentship competition is through
the NERC IAPETUS DTP. A detailed yer describing
the project is available at http://www.iapetus.ac.uk/
Application materials should include a c.v., academic
records and at least two letters of reference sent toa.r.hoelzel@dur.ac.uk. Advisory team: Rus Hoelzel,
Melanie Leng, Darren Grocke and Adrian Lister. Dead-
line is 20 January 2017

EvolutionaryGenetics
Graduate position: Evolutionary genetics at East Car-
olina University
Pending approval of funding, I will be recruiting a doc-
toral student to carry out research associated with a
project focused on the genetic underpinnings of color
pattern evolution in a mimetic radiation of poison frogs
in Peru (see abstract below). The position would for-
mally begin in the fall of 2017, but the student could
potentially participate in eldwork for the project in
Peru in the summer of 2017 before starting in the doc-
toral program. Desirable qualications for this position
include relevant coursework or experience with modern
approaches in evolutionary genetics and genomics, such
as RNA and DNA extraction, RNA and DNA library
preps, Next-generation sequencing (especially on the
Illumina platform), exome capture sequencing, analysis
of Next-Gen datasets including data clean-up, transcrip-
tome assembly, dierential expression analyses, popula-
tion genomic analyses of genomic reduced representation
(e.g. exome capture) datasets, and association analyses
using multi-generational pedigrees. Experience working
with amphibian breeding programs and/or eldwork in
Latin America would also be a plus. I encourage appli-
cations from minorities and under-represented groups of
all kinds. Please send a letter detailing your relevant ex-
perience and explaining your interest in the position, as
well as a current CV (including a summary of academic
coursework, grades and achievements) and GRE scores
(if available) to Kyle Summers (summersk@ecu.edu).

the doctoral program at ECU can be found at: http:/-
/www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/idpbs/ . Abstract of proposed
research The evolution of color pattern diversity in the
context of mimicry has been a focus of theoretical and
empirical attention, yet knowledge of the genetic ba-
sis of this diversity remains limited. Most work on
this topic has focused on a small number of systems
(e.g. Heliconius butteries), limiting the generality of
inferences. This project combines three research groups
with complementary skills and realms of expertise to
investigate the genetic basis and population genomic
processes underlying color pattern divergence in the
context of mimicry in the Peruvian mimic poison frog,
Ranitomeya imitator: Dr. Kyle Summers (East Car-
olina University), Dr. Rasmus Nielsen (UC Berkeley)
and Dr. Matthew MacManes (University of New Hamp-
shire). The project focuses on four specic aims: 1.
Identify key genetic factors involved in color pattern
development in R. imitator by investigating dierential
gene expression across developmental stages and color
pattern morphs. Next generation sequencing will be
used to produce developmental stage-specic transcrip-
tomes for each morph, which will be assembled and
used to investigate patterns of dierential gene expres-
sion. 2.Identify the causal gene(s) underlying dierences
in color pattern between morphs using genome-wide
marker arrays (exome capture sequences) to screen tran-
sition zone samples and enable admixture mapping. We
have identied three admixture zones in the mimetic
radiation that will be appropriate for these analyses.
3. Test the association of specic candidate loci with
color pattern using pedigree analyses of candidate genes
identied from Aims 1 and 2, using a multigenerational
pedigree. 4. Test specic hypotheses regarding selection
and demographic processes in the transition zones and
between mimics and models. These analyses will involve
the development of new analytical tools for analyzing
selection in admixture zones and targeted sequencing
of model species. Together these complementary, recip-
rocally illuminating approaches will begin to reveal the
genetic underpinnings and population genomics of color
pattern diversity in this mimetic radiation of poison
frogs.

regulating cyanobacterial blooms Project description:
Parasitic fungi of the order Chytridiales (i.e. Chytrids)
are able to infect a wide number of phytoplankton
species. Although overlooked for a long time, chytrids
are an important factor driving the dynamics of
phytoplankton. For example, Chytrids seem to be
involved in the decline of toxic cyanobacteria blooms,
by inducing direct mortality of parasitized cells and
indirectly by the mechanistic fragmentation which
weakens the resistance to grazing. On the other hand,
selection on host populations exerted by Chytrids is
also thought to be responsible for maintaining high
host diversity in nature. The candidate will use a
novel host-parasite system (based on a cyanobacterial
host and its chytrid parasite) for advancing in the
eld of parasitism in phytoplankton. The scope of the
project will address dierent questions related to the
physiology, molecular genetics and genomics (including
next-generation-sequencing) of the interactions and
their ecological and evolutionary implications.

EcoGeneticSpeciation
PhD on 'The ecological and genetic determinants of
speciation'
Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London
(Silwood Park Campus), UK
Competition-funded as part of the NERC Doctoral
Training Partnership in Science and Solutions for a
Changing Planet (SSCP).
Supervisor: Prof Tim Barraclough
Key words: speciation, evolution, adaptation, animals,
plants, theory, models, phylogenetics, genomics, experi-
mental evolution
Why does life diversify into multiple species? Why do
some taxa diversify into clearly distinct species whereas
others have blurred species boundaries? Does selectionfavour complete speciation or porous species bound-
aries? Or are species instead an incidental consequence
of long-term isolation of populations?
Answering these questions requires knowledge of the
rates and determinants of the multiple steps by which
speciation occurs. First, an existing species must en-
counter conditions that favour divergence into separate
species. Second, it must respond to those conditions and
evolve population dierences and restrictions to gene
ow. Third, the descendant species must coexist and
persist. Fourth, some of the descendant species must
encounter new conditions that favour further diversi-
cation, for example by expanding their ranges.
We currently have good understanding of some parts
(e.g. genetics of speciation, diversity patterns), but poor
knowledge of others - especially how ecological condi-
tions inuence each step of diversication. Experiments
that quantify key processes over multiple generations
have been lacking - much of our understanding comes
from observational evidence. In short, we lack the kind
of robust theory and evidence that is available for other
ecological and evolutionary processes.
The goal of this PhD is to build synthetic understanding
of speciation by assembling information on the multiple
steps in the process. The student will use several ap-
proaches to tackle the problem including 2 or more of
the following:
1) Mathematical or computational modelling, combining
macroevolutionary and population genetic approaches
to model speciation dynamics
2) Comparative population genetics to quantify the na-
ture of species boundaries and estimate the rates of
dierent stages in speciation. An existing system that
could be adopted is the owering plants of the Cape
region of South Africa
3) 'Speciation in action' in the laboratory - using exper-
imental evolution to determine the conditions aecting
selection on species boundaries. Existing systems that
could be adopted include wild yeasts or tree-hole bacte-
ria.
4) Meta-analyses of published data from a range of
animal, plant and/or microbial groups, including the
analysis of emerging whole genome data.
The balance of approaches will be exible based on the
student's interests and would be developed in discus-
sion to address current gaps in understanding. If you
have strong interests in evolutionary biology and you
are keen to develop theoretical, molecular, experimen-
tal, eld and/or molecular skills, then this is the PhD
for you! Motivation to develop your own ideas is more38 EvolDir January 1, 2017

which can be learned during the PhD.

EvolutionMicrobialCommunities
PhD on 'The evolutionary dynamics of microbial com-
munities'
Departments of Life Sciences and Mathematics, Impe-
rial College London, based at Silwood Park Campus,
UK.
Competition-funded as part of the NERC Centre for
Doctoral Training in Quantitative and Modelling Skills
in Ecology and Evolution (QMEE).
Supervisors: Prof Tim Barraclough (Life Sciences) and
Prof Mauricio Barahona (Mathematics)
Microbial communities underpin many ecosystem ser-
vices that human populations depend upon. Nutrient
cycling, waste-water treatment and the digestive sys-
tems of animals all depend on the combined actions of
hundreds or thousands of interacting species. Under-standing of microbial diversity has been revolutionised
by metagenomics. Yet, it remains extremely hard to
predict microbial dynamics in response to changing con-
ditions, such as climate change, pollution or a change
in diet. General theory for the dynamics of bacteria
embedded in diverse systems is lacking.
Current models of microbial ecosystem functions of-
ten treat the community as a black-box - ignoring the
fact that responses will depend on how metabolic func-
tions and traits are packaged among interacting species.
Critically, models and data are needed that incorpo-
rate evolution, since microbes can rapidly adapt to new
conditions. Ecological interactions alter evolutionary
responses and vice versa, but tracking evolution in di-
verse microbial assemblages is hard. Models are needed
to shape predictions and to develop new methods for
statistical inference from metagenome data.
In this PhD, you will develop new theory for predict-
ing evolutionary and functional dynamics of microbial
communities facing changing conditions. Over-arching
questions include: how predictable are evolutionary dy-
namics in systems with hundreds of species, does evolu-
tion of constituent species promote or disrupt ecosystem
functioning and stability and can we use evolutionary
theory to guide human interventions in microbial com-
munities, for example creating designer microbiomes?
The building blocks will be models that predict bacte-
rial growth (and consequently species interactions) from
their use of metabolites. In a decomposer community,
input resources are broken down successively by dierent
populations of bacteria into a set of output resources.
Depending on context, we might want to optimise the
breakdown of inputs (e.g. wood pulp waste), or produc-
tion of intermediates (e.g. short-chain fatty acids in the
human gut) or end-products (e.g. methane in biofuels).
You will develop mechanistic models of microbial com-
munities to predict dynamics and devise statistical meth-
ods for detecting evolutionary dynamics from omic
data, for example using network modelling (2). In-
teraction networks can be extracted from data using
graph-theoretical methods for geometric dimensionality
reduction as well as sparsication techniques from statis-
tics. Predictions and statistical methods will be tested
on real data - either from the literature or evolution
experiments (3), depending on your interests. Vali-
dated models will then be used to identify conditions
that promote particular dynamic outcomes and to de-
sign evolutionary strategies for improving functioning of
microbiomes that humans rely on. The project will com-
bine microbial ecology and evolution with mathematics
and statistics.

EvolutionSexualBehaviours
The evolution of sexual behaviours: developing and test-
ing biological models of non-reproductive sex, including
homosexuality
SUITABLE FOR STUDENT WITH EITHER MATH-
EMATICAL OR BIOLOGICAL STUDY BACK-
GROUNDSupervisor:
Professor Vincent Savolainen; Imperial College London,
Life Sciences
Co-supervised by: Dr Richard Everitt (University of
Reading; Mathematics and Statistics); Dr Jason Hodg-
son and Professor Emeritus Russ Lande FRS, Imperial
College; in collaboration with Dr Emily Bethell (Liver-
pool John Moores University)
Project summary:
Sexual behaviour takes multiple forms across organisms,
and although it has evolved for reproduction, it also
serves other social purposes. Across species, males usu-
ally have sex with females (heterosexuality), however
this is not always the case, and there are numerous
possible variations. For example, homosexual behaviour
is common throughout the animal world, and has often
been considered an evolutionary paradox. The existence
of the supposed paradox is likely a conuence of the
assumption that those who engage in homosexuality
fail to reproduce, coupled with cultural disapproval of
homosexual behaviour. Some of this confusion may also
stem from the fact that most researchers have considered
sexuality to be a binary trait with either homosexual
or heterosexual trait states. If sexual preference is a
continuous trait inuenced by many dierent genes of
small eect, or some epigenetic marks canalizing a 'mo-
saic' development, then the persistence of homosexual
behaviour is not particularly surprising. The seeming
Darwinian paradox of homosexual behaviour has led
to the development of several biological models to ex-
plain its prevalence. Most models fall into two broad
categories: genetic and epigenetic models. Genetic mod-
els typically explain the persistence of a hypothetical
homosexual gene variant (allele) through some indi-
rect evolutionary advantage for that variant (e.g. see
Savolainen & Lehmann, Nature 445:158, 2007). Epige-
netic models explain homosexual behaviour as a result
of heritable changes in gene expression patterns due
to chemical modications that occur to the DNA of
developing organisms (Rice et al., Quarterly Review of
Biology 87:343, 2012). These models each make clear
predictions, however, there is only limited support for
any of them. Also, these models may be too simplistic
to account for the complexity of behaviours found in the
wild. Furthermore, Savolainen & Hodgson (Encyclopae-
dia of Evolutionary Psychology, in press) have proposed
an alternative model, the bisexual advantage model,
whereby homosexuality is a quantitative trait controlled
by many loci. This bisexual advantage model is perhaps
the most conservative genetic explanation for the persis-
tence of homosexual behaviour because sexuality would
then follow the pattern of the vast majority of quantita-40 EvolDir January 1, 2017
tive traits where intermediate phenotypes are favoured
(Lande, Genetics Research 26:221, 1976). It may be the
case that some degree of bisexuality is actually an evolu-
tionary optimum phenotype in many species, including
humans. The student will formalize mathematically
models for the evolution of non-reproductive sexual be-
haviours depending on the ecology of species, and also
including the bisexual advantage model proposed above.
The student will make predictions using mathemati-
cal genetics, computer simulations and computing tools
such as machine deep learning. S/he will also use and/or
collect behavioural data in a well-established eld sys-
tem to test these predictions. This project will integrate
approaches from evolutionary biology, animal behaviour,
genetics and mathematical biology to disentangle the
evolutionary ecology of sexual behaviours in natural
environments, while addressing a problem with large
social implications in human societies.

SUPERVISORS:
Dr Matteo Fumagalli (Imperial College London, Life
Sciences), Professor Matthew Fisher (Imperial College
London, Infectious Disease Epidemiology), Dr Richard

tics)
PROJECT SUMMARY:
The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium den-
drobatidis (Bd) is responsible for hundreds of species'
extinctions (Fisher et al. Nature. 2012). The genetic
mechanisms that underpin Bd's virulence are not known
yet, although extreme chromosomal plasticity has been
suggested to play a role (Farrer et al. PLoS Genet.
2013). Large-scale genomic data from worldwide iso-
lates, coupled with appropriate computational methods,
will provide us with an opportunity to address how
virulent Bd strains spread around the globe.
This project will encompass three main aims: (i) the
improvement of computational methods for large-scale
high-throughput sequencing data from mixed-ploidy
genome, (ii) the development of a comprehensive bioin-
formatics platform, (iii) the extension of the methods
developed in previous aims to genomic data of Bd iso-
lates distributed worldwide.
HOW TO APPLY:
This project is suitable for students with either a quan-
titative or empirical background. Applicants should be
meet the UK NERC eligibility criteria.
To apply, please follow instructions provided at the
Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantitative and
Modelling Skills in Ecology & Evolution (http://-

biology and Paleobiology" (MGAP) at the Ludwig-
Maximilians-Universit at (LMU) Munich (Germany) for
international students until 31 Jan 2017*
The Master's program \Geobiology and Paleobiology"
(MGAP) is a consecutive, research-focussed, two-year
Master of Science program at the Faculty of Geosciences
of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at (LMU) Munich,
in collaboration with researchers of the Bavarian Natu-
ral History Collections and the GeoBio-Center @ LMU.
MGAP aims to provide students with a comprehensive
introduction into the interdisciplinary research elds of
geobiology and paleobiology to prepare them for careers
in science and beyond.
The MGAP program is based on interdisciplinary,
research-oriented courses in geo- and biosciences that
address patterns and processes of the evolution of life
and its habitats on our planet. Principal topics are
evolutionary and environmental geobiology and paleo-
biology, supported by courses in complementary areas
e.g., bioinformatics and statistics.
The module-based curriculum provides an integrative ap-
proach facilitated by experts in dierent areas of exper-
tise. Students will learn and acquire routines with a wide
range of scientic methods such as modern techniques
in molecular biology, eldwork, collection management,
comparative morphology & phylogeny, bioinformatics,
statistics and (paleo-) biodiversity assessments. Stu-
dents will learn independent scientic work in individ-
ual and intensively supervised research projects at early
stages of the curriculum.

Research in the Range lab deals with fundamental ques-
tions in animal evolution and development - how signal
transduction interactions control the gene regulatory net-
works that establish specic territories along the major
axes during early embryogenesis. Most of our research fo-
cuses on understanding how a network of three dierent
Wnt signaling branches (Wnt/Beta-catenin, Wnt/JNK,
and Wnt/Ca2+) coordinate the regulatory networks
that establish territories along the anterior-posterior
axis in sea urchin embryos. Remarkably, functional42 EvolDir January 1, 2017
and expression studies in other metazoans (vertebrates,
urochordates, hemichordates, echinoderms and cnidar-
ians) suggest that many aspects of this Wnt network
governing AP axis specication in the sea urchin might
have existed in the common ancestor of bilaterians and
cnidarians.
We are recruiting a talented PhD student to work on a
NIH funded project beginning in the Fall of 2017. The
project will focus on the role of the Wnt/JNK pathway
and the gene regulatory network it activates during AP
axis specication and patterning in sea urchin embryos.
A secondary focus will be on the conservation of this
mechanism during hemichordate AP axis specication
and patterning. The position oers training in a com-
bination of molecular manipulations, high-throughput
genome-wide assays and bioinformatics, gene regulatory
network analysis as well as classical embryology.
Interested applicants should contact Dr. Ryan Range at

Project summary: Colouration in animals can be shaped
by a multitude of factors, from chemical and physical
properties of the skin to higher-level drivers of colour
variation such as natural and sexual selection. While a
lot of the focus has been directed to the role of colour in

of techniques, this project aims to investigate the ther-
mal eects of coloured integumentary tissue in lizards
from both a proximate and ultimate perspective by 1)
characterizing thermal properties of dierently-coloured
integument, 2) elucidating form-function relationships
for dierent colour production mechanisms (including
iridescence) through optical and heat-transfer models
and 3) explore the role of thermal eects in the evolution
of animal coloration.

PhD Opportunity in Wildlife Disease Genetics - Trent
University/Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and
Forestry
We are seeking a graduate student (preferably a Ph.D
candidate) to perform research in the realm of bat ge-
nomics in relation to rapid changes in selective pressures
from disease.
Infectious diseases are critically important in species
adaptation, evolution, and persistence. However, cli-
matic changes are altering disease dynamics many sys-
tems by promoting the invasion of novel diseases and
disease vectors. We intend to investigate the capacity
of bats to adapt to rapid changes in pathogen-mediated
selection, and thus assess threats to their persistence.
One approach for understanding adaptation to disease
is to examine the correlation between the geographic dis-
tribution of host immunogenetic variation and of disease
variants, with these correlations interpreted relative to
demographic parameters that also inuence the distri-
bution of adaptive and non-adaptive genetic variation.
We are seeking a student to take an adaptive landscape
genomics approach to investigate contemporary evolu-
tion and demographic constraints on local adaptation
among coevolved and na ve disease vectors. This work
will take place within a collaborative group of Trent
University and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
and Forestry (OMNRF) researchers investigating bat
declines and White Nose fugus.
The successful candidate will also be encouraged to
develop/explore independent research within the frame-
work of existing funding. This research will be con-
ducted within the Natural Resources DNA Proling and
Forensic Centre (www.nrdpfc.ca). Applicants would
ideally hold a MSc in Landscape/Population Genetics
or Bioinformatics, and have experience processing large
data sets from massively parallel sequencing platforms.
There may also be an opportunity to participate in
eld work. Previous experience working with bats is
preferred but not required. Candidates must be willing
to be vaccinated against rabies. All candidates should
submit a letter of application and research interest, cur-
riculum vitae, and names and contact information for

==roject Description: It is generally assumed that adap-
tation drives genome evolution. But, there has not beenJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 49
an experimental system to study the evolutionary signif-
icance of non-adaptive processes, such as genetic drift,
mutation and recombination. Using a combination of
experimental and computational methods, this PhD stu-
dentship will identify how adaptive and non-adaptive
processes contribute to the evolution of gene regulatory
networks. Employing our well-established Pseudomonas
system, the project uses experimental evolution in con-
junction with molecular biology and genomics to assess
whether novel mutations aecting gene regulation are
adaptive or non-adaptive. Employing the University's
Balena system (a massively parallel architecture, high-
performance computing platform), the experimental
work will be complimented by simulations of gene regu-
latory network evolution to identify the processes driving
non-adaptive evolutionary patterns. The computational
biology component of the project may also stimulate the
development of techniques in machine learning, to train
computers to recognise patterns of gene networks which
contribute to adaptive and non-adaptive processes in
the context of network evolution.
== Location: This project will be conducted under the
direct supervision of Dr Tiany B. Taylor, and based
within the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at
the University of Bath (UK) in the new Milner Centre
for Evolution (http://www.bath.ac.uk/groups/milner-

== Requirements: We are looking for a biology graduate
who has a strong interest in genetics and gene networks,
or a computer science graduate with interests in evolu-
tion and evolutionary theory. Some practical experience
in microbiology and molecular techniques is highly de-
sired but training will be provided to strengthen these
areas. The successful candidate will be enthusiastic,
highly motivated, independent, have experience in mi-
crobiology, molecular biology or evolutionary biology
(or a combination), and have a relevant degree. The
applicant must meet the standard University of Bath
English language requirements. The applicant must be
a UK citizen or an EU citizen who has been residing in
the UK for 3 years prior to appointment.
== Training: The candidate will be trained to use the
University's Balena system and have the opportunity
to develop new approaches to machine learning to help
solve biological problems. In this unique project the
student will also develop laboratory skills in microbiol-
ogy, molecular biology and genomics. To achieve this,
the candidate will require access to the labs - laboratory
training will be provided by Tiany Taylor. They will
also need access to the Balena HC cluster - training
to be provided by Michael Tipping. And in order to
eectively design a computational simulation that is rele-

Genetics of speciation in house mice: Identifying molec-
ular and developmental mechanisms of hybrid male
sterility
Main supervisor: Dr Leslie Turner Second supervisor:
Prof Jason Wolf
Linking genotype to phenotype and tness in nature is
the ultimate goal of most evolutionary genetics research,
but is rarely accomplished in practice. The genes and
molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation and speci-
ation remain largely unknown. The goal of this project
is to determine genetic and developmental causes of
hybrid male sterility, a key reproductive barrier between
house mice subspecies. This research builds on previ-
ous studies identifying genetic variants associated with
reduced fertility in a laboratory cross and in hybrid
zone mice. Characterizing the mechanisms of a single
locus in natural or outbred populations is challenging
due to genetic variability among individuals. To over-50 EvolDir January 1, 2017
come this challenge, we will use a unique set of inbred
mouse strains bred from wild-caught hybrid zone mice
by Dr Turner over the last several years. Leveraging the
power of inbred strains, we can compare nearly iden-
tical wild-derived genomes in multiple individuals and
dierent developmental stages. This novel approach
has great promise for identifying pathways, genes, and
molecular mechanisms contributing to the evolution of
a reproductive barrier in nature.
The student selected for this project will integrate ap-
proaches from evolutionary genomics and reproductive
biology to (1) determine the nature and timing of defects
during spermatogenesis, and (2) functionally evaluate
candidate sterility genes. You will characterize defects
in hybrid lines across a developmental time course. Next,
to identify the most promising candidate genes, you will
combine your results with population genomics and data
mining of available 'omics and knockout data. Finally,
you will evaluate candidate genes using in vitro and in
vivo functional assays.
This project will be based within the Department
of Biology and Biochemistry at the University of
Bath (UK) in the new Milner Centre for Evolu-
tion (http://www.bath.ac.uk/groups/milner-centre-for-
evolution/). The student will gain expertise in both
experimental and bioinformatic approaches from genet-
ics, evolutionary genomics and reproductive biology and
have access to excellent research facilities (e.g., animal
facility, histology, imaging).
Requirements: We are looking for a biology graduate
with a strong background in genetics, evolutionary bi-
ology or reproductive biology. Experience in molecular
techniques is highly desired. The successful candidate
will be motivated, independent, and enthusiastic about
learning diverse skills for interdisciplinary research.
UK and EU students applying for this project may be
considered for a University Research Studentship which
will cover Home/EU tuition fees, a training support fee
of 1000 per annum and a tax-free maintenance allowance
of 14,296 (2016/17 rate) for 3.5 years.
Note: ONLY UK and EU applicants are eligible for the
studentship; unfortunately, applicants who are classed
as Overseas for fee paying purposes are NOT eligible for
funding. We welcome all-year round applications from
self-funded candidates and candidates who can source

Macroevolution Reduviidae
Graduate position: UC Riverside Macroevolution Reduviidae
The Heteropteran Systematics Lab @ UCR (http://-
heteroptera.ucr.edu/) is looking for a new PhD student
(starting fall 2017) who would be part of a research team
investigating the evolutionary history of Reduvioidea,
the assassin bugs. Candidates with strong background in
systematic entomology and phylogenetics are preferred.
Please contact christiane.weirauch@ucr.edu for more in-
formation and check UCR Entomology for details on
application procedures.
The project: an international research team led by the
Heteropteran Systematics Lab @ UCR will shed light on
the evolutionary history and diversication of a charis-
matic clade of predatory and hematophagous insects,
the speciose Reduvioidea or assassin bugs ( >6,822 de-
scribed spp.). Existing phylogenies of Reduvioidea are
inadequate to address many evolutionary questions, the
paucity of well-described fossils has made it dicult to
establish time-lines for events including the transition
from predatory to hematophagous life style, and the
classication of Reduvioidea is in disarray. We will:
1) test phylogenetic hypotheses with emphasis on the
poorly resolved Higher Reduviidae and contentious rela-
tionships of the hematophagous Chagas disease vectors
Triatominae, while maximizing taxonomic coverage and
integrating transcriptomic, anchored hybrid enrichment,
traditional molecular, and morphological datasets; 2)
describe and redescribe fossil reduvioids to bridge tax-
onomic and geological gaps in the fossil record and
test hypotheses on the timing of key biological events;
3) study diversication across Reduvioidea, focusing
on hypotheses of diversication rate shifts and corre-
lated key innovations, and morphological, physiological,
and ecological traits involved in the transition between
predation and hematophagy; 4) use the phylogenetic
information generated during this project to propose aJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 51
new classication of Reduvioidea.
Potential PhD projects: could focus on phylogenetic
and phylogenomic approaches to unravelling relation-
ships within Reduvioidea, comparative morphology and
morphological character evolution across the group, key
innovations in the evolution of hematophagy, or diversi-
cation analyses.

JumpingSpiderColorEvolution
Hi all,
I am recruiting two PhD students to join my research
group at the University of Cincinnati in the summer or
fall of 2017. I am particularly interested in recruiting
new students to join our research on the coevolution of
jumping spider color vision and coloration.
One available PhD position, funded through an active
NSF grant, will investigate the role of female visual
attention/gaze in driving the evolution of complex male
displays in the North American jumping spider genus
Habronattus. This research project combines inten-
sive eld work with lab-based video characterization
of male displays and eye-tracking of female gaze re-
sponses to video playback of displaying males (the latter
in collaboration with Beth Jakob at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst).
The second doctoral position will support a new research
initiative in my group to understand the repeated evo-
lution of color vision across jumping spiders. Thus far,
we have identied two independent and functionally dis-
tinct transitions from dichromacy to tri-/tetrachromacy
in jumping spiders, which are tightly associated with
subsequent rapid diversication of male color ornamenta-
tion. We are now interested in identifying any additional
evolutionary transitions in color vision, characterizing
when and why they occurred, and investigating their
\downstream" consequences for biodiversity in this group
of animals. This work will leverage international eld
work with molecular, microspectrophotometric, and hy-
perspectral imaging approaches.
In addition to these new research initiatives, we havea number of other research projects that could provide
opportunities for incoming students. I am currently
adding more information about these on my lab web-
site: www.morehouselab.com . Students interested in
joining the lab should contact me as soon as possible
to discuss their interests and t for the lab. Please
include a brief statement of your research interests, how
they connect with our current research, and your CV,
academic transcripts, and GRE scores if available.

PhD student positions in phylogenomics, host-symbiont
diversication in the Simon Lab (see also our postdoc-
toral ad)
The Simon lab at the University of Connecticut seeks
creative and motivated PhD students and Postdoctoral
candidates interested in phylogenetics, molecular phy-
logenomics, bioinformatics, and/or symbiont-host inter-
actions (endosymbionts and/or microbiomes) to begin in
the summer or fall of 2017. Experience in the preceding
subjects preferred but not required.
Applicants will participate in an NSF sponsored project
entitled: Exploring Symbiont Biodiversity and Com-
plexity in the Family Cicadidae. The major goal of this
proposal is to study the co-diversication and interac-
tion between cicadas, their primary \obligate" endosym-
bionts, their secondary \facultative" endosymbionts and
their gut microbiota. Cicada obligate endosymbionts
have recently been demonstrated to exhibit spectacu-
lar and unprecedented genome diversity. Since cicada
symbionts are largely unknown our work will result in
considerable biodiversity discovery. We hypothesize that
gain or loss of host-symbiont consortium members dur-
ing cicada phylogenetic history will be correlated with
internal or external environmental changes. We are
most interested in the timing of symbiont consortium
changes. For example, does the gain of a secondary
(facultative) endosymbiont facilitate the breakdown or
loss of primary (obligate) endosymbionts? Or does the
breakdown or loss of the obligate endosymbiont allow
invasion by a secondary endosymbiont? Similarly, we
ask whether the changes in the gut microbiota aect
primary endosymbionts (keeping in mind that gut mi-
crobiota are known to synthesize essential amino acids
for some hosts). Other hypotheses concern changes insymbiont consortium membership related to changes in
the biotic or abiotic external environment coincident
with the invasion of new biogeographic areas charac-
terized by dierent climates and host plants. Broader
impacts will involve teaching collaborations with team
members in the US, Brazil, China, India, NZ, and Fiji.
Field trips to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Fiji, and India
are planned.
Senior Personnel and collaborators on the project in-
clude: Thomas Buckley (NZ), David Marshall, John

hanya Hajong (IN), Cong Wei (CN), Hong He (CN),
Daniela Takiya (BR), Tatiana Ruschel (BR), and Peter
Lockhart (NZ, FJ), and numerous cicada researchers
around the world.
Interested and qualied PhD candidates should send an
email describing their motivation, skills, and research
experience/interests along with a CV, GPA, GRE and
TOEFL (if relevant) scores. Applicants should also ar-
range to have letters sent letters sent by three referees
who are familiar with the candidates work. Strong ap-
plicants will be contacted to schedule an informal Skype
interview. Applications to UCONN (early admission)
are due December 15th with rolling admission thereafter.
I recommend applying asap and prior to January 15th.
Financial support for Ph.D. students is available via
research assistantships from our NSF award, teaching as-
sistantships, and university fellowships, but applications
to outside funding sources are also strongly encouraged.
Send all material to chris.simon@uconn.edu
The successful candidates will join the EEB Department

of risk and survival times (Theme: Precision Medicine:
Pathology to Population Health). MRC IMPACT stu-
dentships are for 3.5 years which includes an initial 13
week Cohort Training Programme with the PhD project
commencing in January 2018.

Idiopathic pulmonary brosis: novel insights into the
genetic basis of risk and survival times
Supervisor: Dr Louise Wain (University of Leicester)
and Professor Gisli Jenkins (University of Nottingham)
Summary: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a
rare, chronic and progressive lung disease with a very
poor prognosis (median survival 3 years) and limited
treatment options and there is a need for new therapy
and approaches to treatment. The primary aim of this
project will be to discover novel genetic determinants
of IPF risk and survival. These will further our un-
derstanding of the disease processes involved in IPF
by identifying genes and pathways involved, and could
lead to the development of new IPF drugs. In addition,
inclusion of genetic predictors of risk and survival time
in clinical prediction models could improve clinical care
by facilitating approaches to stratify disease (\preci-
sion medicine"). The student will be based within an
internationally-recognised respiratory genetic epidemi-
ology group with close collaborations with leading IPF
clinicians and researchers. A broad training in geneticepidemiology will equip the student for a career in the
fast-moving and opportunity-rich eld of human dis-
ease genetics. Applicants should have a background in
bioinformatics, epidemiology, statistics or genetics (or
similar) with an aptitude for computing (prior experi-
ence of programming is advantageous but not essential)
and a keen interest in genetics and human disease.
2. Department funded studentship (3 years): The role
of complex genetic variation of immune system genes in
respiratory health and disease. Supervised by Dr Louise
Wain and Dr Ed Hollox (Department of Genetics) The
studentship is for 3 years and will commence in October
2017. The student will be based in the Department of
Health Sciences.
Respiratory disease is major public health concern and
the third leading cause of death globally. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identied multiple re-
gions of the genome associated with respiratory health
and disease and amongst these, one of the strongest sig-
nals of association is in the Human Leukocyte Antigen
(HLA) region gene cluster on chromosome 6 which en-
codes proteins with essential roles in the immune system.
However, the HLA region is complex and understand-
ing the mechanisms underlying the genetic signals of
association in this region requires sophisticated ana-
lytical approaches. Bespoke computational methods
which measure variation of the HLA region, and of
other clusters of functionally-related genes, at both the
genetic and protein level, have been developed. This
project will involve applying these methods to large
general population cohorts to explore both the direct
and interactive eects of variation at immune gene clus-
ters on respiratory traits and disease. The student will
develop research skills at the interface of genetics, statis-
tics and computer science which will equip them for a
career in the exciting and fast-moving eld of genetic
epidemiology. A background in bioinformatics, genetics
or statistics is preferred and a keen interest in develop-
ing further skills in all of those areas, and in the use
of high performance computing to analyse very large
data sets, is essential. Contact Louise Wain (louise-
wain@leicester.ac.uk) for further details. The deadline
for applications for this studentship are likely to close
~9th January 2017. The advert, and details of how to
apply, will become available shortly.

ULeicester KinshipDeductionForen-

Fully-funded BBSRC-iCASE PhD Project: Next-
generation kinship deduction for forensic and genealogi-
cal analysis
University of registration: University of Leicester
Project supervisors: Professor Nuala Sheehan (Depart-
ment of Health Sciences) & Professor Mark Jobling
(Department of Genetics)
Non-Academic partner: Dr Martin Blythe - DNA World-
wide Group
Project outline:
The use of DNA analysis to determine familial relation-
ships between human individuals is very well established.
For close (rst-degree) pairwise relationships as targeted
in the paternity test, a small number of polymorphic
markers (the short-tandem repeats [STRs] also used
in forensic individual identication) is analysed, and
probabilities of true paternity can be established with
near certainty. However, there is also a need in some
applications to estimate more distant kin relationships:
in forensic casework 'familial searching' exploits the fact
that a perpetrator and their relative(s) are expected
to share 'similar' DNA proles, which can provide in-
vestigative information when the relative(s) are in the
National DNA Database but the perpetrator is not;
in immigration cases a claim of relationship may need
to be validated in order to allow entry; in genealogi-
cal research participants may have specic hypotheses
about their relationships which they wish to support
via DNA evidence. The kinship estimation problem
is more dicult in these cases because with each ad-
ditional generation that separates two individuals, the
expected proportion of the genome shared identical by
descent (IBD) halves. Additional power can be gained
by increasing the number of DNA markers analysed, for
example by using genome-wide SNP chips.The project proposed here addresses these issues by
exploring the potential of NGS forensic multiplexes and
genome-wide SNP data in relationship estimation, us-
ing real-world data. Forensically-relevant data will be
generated by typing either the Promega Powerseq or
Illumina Forenseq multiplex on existing pedigree DNA
collections. Anonymised genome-wide SNP data will be
obtained from DNA Worldwide (consenting clients, and
a dataset of 72 individuals from 9 pedigrees). Both
the forensic multiplexes and the genome-wide data
(based on the HumanOmniExpressExome-8 chip) in-
clude uniparentally-inherited markers (Y chromosome,
mitochondrial DNA) as well as biparentally-inherited
(autosomal) markers. A novel feature of this project is
to investigate ecient incorporation of such data with
SNP-based likelihood estimates by considering haplo-
type frequencies and possible pedigree structures includ-
ing sex. A key issue will be to understand the sensitivity
of relationship estimation to allele frequencies, and a
number of approaches will be taken, including the use of
internal frequencies from the data themselves, data from
public resources such as HapMap, or our own datasets.
Detailed sensitivity analyses will be carried out through
extensive simulation studies.
In this industrially-sponsored iCASE project, the stu-
dent will spend a total of at least 3 months during the
PhD working at DNA Worldwide, in Frome, Somer-
set. Training will be given in the bioinformatic analysis
pipelines and databasing used to process, categorize
and manage the multitude of data generated through
consumer genotyping, and in essential business skills
involving public presentation, listening and communica-
tion, organisation, project management, marketing and
nances.

ULeicester SexSelection
Sex, selection and dierential gene expression: do
changes in the mode of sexual reproduction inuence
the magnitude and extent of sex-biased gene expression?
Competition funded PhD studentship at the University
of Leicester (UK) in collaboration with Africa Gomez
at the University of Hull (UK)
For more details: rh225@le.ac.uk
Females and males have almost identical genomes but
are exposed to conicting selective pressures. It is hy-
pothesised that these conicting selective pressures -
known as sexually antagonistic selection - are the expla-
nation for multiple independent evolutions of sex-biased
gene expression and also sex chromosomes [1]. However,
empirically testing the role of sexually antagonistic se-
lection has been hampered by the lack of suitable experi-
mental systems as sex dierences are often longstanding
[2].
Using a model system we have developed [3-5] - the tad-
pole shrimp, Triops sp. - this project will test whether
changes in the mode of sexual reproduction inuences
the magnitude and extent of sex-biased gene expression.
We have shown that tadpole shrimps (Triops) show
multiple transitions between separate sexes (dioecy)
and individuals with male and female function
(hermaphrodites) [3, 6]. Importantly such changes alter
the strength of sexually antagonistic selection [7]. We
therefore have a system where sexually antagonistic se-
lection diers so its role on sex-biased gene expression
to be tested. Furthermore, we have shown that sex
is genetic in Triops cancriformis and that sex chromo-
some regions are larger in dioecious populations than in
hermaphrodite populations, a pattern consistent with a
reduction in sexually antagonistic selection [5].
This PhD will investigate two species where
hermaphroditism has evolved independently and there
are both dioecious and hermaphrodite populations (Tri-
ops cancriformis and Triops longicaudatus).
The student will test whether: - genes with female bi-
ased expression in dioecious populations are less biased
in hermaphrodites - genes with male biased expression
in dioecious populations less biased in hermaphrodites -
There is an eect of genome position (e.g. within or out-side the sex chromosome region) of genes on the degree
of change in expression bias. - There are convergent
patterns of change in Triops cancriformis and Triops
longicaudatus.
Objectives: 1. To develop sex-specic genetic markers
for identication of males, females and hermaphrodites
in T. cancriformis / longicaudatus. 2. To identify genes
located within the sex specic region of males, females
and hermaphrodites in T. cancriformis / longicaudatus.
3. To test for a reduction in the dierential expression
of sex- associated genes in the transition from dioecy to
hermaphroditism in T. cancriformis / longicaudatus
The student will be based in the Department of Ge-
netics at the University of Leicester and supervised by
Rob Hammond (https://goo.gl/fhTYcg) in Leicester in
collaboration with Africa Gomez and the University of
Hull (https://goo.gl/Hfqgpn) and with Eamonn Mal-

Project Description:
Nanopore sequencing has the potential to free DNA anal-
ysis from the specialist laboratory and enable tests to
be performed at an aordable price when and where re-
quired. Hand portable third generation DNA sequencers
such as the MinION developed by the industrial sponsor
Oxford Nanopore Technologies are intended to make se-
quencing a commonplace activity by simplifying and au-
tomating as much of the process as possible with dispos-
able microuidic units ultimately performing the stages
manually performed by laboratory personnel. ^ a eWe
wish to explore the capabilities of nanopore sequencing
for capacity building in countries that lack easy access to
DNA analysis centres. A primary need for both the con-
servation geneticist and the wildlife protection agencies
is the ability to analyse mitochondrial DNA which en-
compasses not only the highly conserved barcode genes,
which vary characteristically between species allowing
condent assignment to a taxonomic group, but also the
hypervariable DNA regions. The latter can be used to
discriminate between dierent maternal lineages withina population as a result of their very high mutation
rate, whilst other regions of the mitochondrial genome
with intermediate mutation rates oer information at

PhD position: Ecology with emphasis in evolutionary
ecology of butteries and moths
The doctorate student will work within the research
project 'Evolutionary ecology of butteries and moths'.
The aim of the project is to investigate the causes and
consequences of genetic and phenotypic variation, using
butteries and moths as model systems. Part of the
research will be conducted in within the framework of an
ongoing project regarding the ecological consequences
for populations and species of variation in functionally
important traits, such as life-history characteristics and
color patterns. For this, we have at our disposal ecologi-
cal data for a large number of moth species that can be
used for comparative analyses to evaluate hypotheses
and test predictions. The research will also include initi-
ating a new project. Field studies and laboratory work
will be used to collect information on the distribution,
dynamics, genetic structure and composition of natural
(meta-) populations of selected moths and butteries,
likely on the island of ~Aland. Data will be used to
investigate how environmental heterogeneity impact on
ecological and evolutionary processes and shape patterns
of population-level diversity, and how population-level
diversity in turn may feed-back on ecological and evo-
lutionary processes. The successful applicant will be
part of EEMiS, a multidisciplinary center of excellenceJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 61
within Linnaeus University.
Linnaeus University was established when Kalmar Uni-
versity and V axj o University merged. The Department
of Biology and Environmental Science is part of the Fac-
ulty of Health and Life Sciences. The research activities
within the Department of Biology and Environmental
Science include the areas of aquatic ecology, cell and
organism biology, evolutionary biology, microbiology,

UManchester BirdSongEvolution
PhD Position: Understanding and controlling the evo-
lution of reproductive behaviour during ex situ conser-
vationMain supervisor: Tucker Gilman (https://-
manchesterbehaviouralevolution.wordpress.com/-
people/) University of Manchester
Human appropriation of land and resources is reducing
the habitat available to non-human species. As a re-
sult, many species are now being conserved ex situ. In
such cases, natural phenotypes and diversity must be
maintained in captive populations to allow for potential
rewilding in the future. Much attention has been paid to
the conservation of genotypes and genetic diversity, but
heritable behaviours can also evolve in captivity, and
the conservation of behaviours has received relatively
little attention.
Birdsong is one behaviour that can evolve in captiv-
ity. For example, the Bengalese nch is a domesticated
variant of the white-rumped munia, and during domesti-
cation its song has become more complex than that of its
wild ancestor. Because of its role in mate recognition,
birdsong is of particular importance to conservation
practitioners. If the songs of captive and wild popula-
tions diverge until the animals cannot recognise each
other as mates, it may be impossible to supplement wild
populations with releases from captivity. In addition,
if songs diverge among captive populations, it may be
dicult to maintain genetic diversity by transferring
animals among ex situ conservation facilities.
The Java sparrow is a congener of the Bengalese nch
and is a species of conservation concern. A formal ex-situ
conservation programme for the species is being devel-
oped. Despite its close relationship to the Bengalese
nch, nothing is known about how captivity aects the
song of the Java sparrow. Thus, population managers
do not know whether they should be concerned about
song conservation in this species. Moreover, if song con-
servation is important, practitioners lack evidence-based
tools for achieving it.
In this project, we aim to i) understand how and why
Bengalese nch song has evolved in captivity, ii) assess
whether Java sparrow song is also aected by captivity,
and iii) evaluate strategies for maintaining wild-type
birdsong in captive populations. The student will:
1. Use molecular approaches to reconstruct the popula-
tion history of the Bengalese nch in captivity. This will
help us to understand when and how Benaglese nch
song diverged from that of its wild ancestor.
2. Assess whether song has diverged among Bengalese
nch populations in North America, Europe, and Asia.
This will help us to understand whether songs have
evolved due to drift, or whether similar selective pres-
sures drive song evolution in dierent captive popula-
tions.62 EvolDir January 1, 2017
3. Use mate choice trials to determine whether diver-
gence among Bengalese nch populations, and between
Bengalese nch and white-rumped munia populations,
is sucient to inhibit mating and inuence gene ow.
4. Assess whether song has diverged among native, cap-
tive, and introduced populations of Java sparrows. If
divergence has occurred, assess whether this is sucient
to inhibit gene ow between populations.
5. Design and assess husbandry practices to slow or re-
verse song divergence in captive populations of estrildid
nches.
The student in this project will receive training in mod-
ern molecular genetic approaches for analysing popula-
tion history (e.g., whole mtDNA sequencing or haplo-
type sharing), statistical approaches for assessing sim-
ilarity and divergence between birdsongs, mate choice
trials and behavioural assays, and birdsong recording in
the eld and in the lab.
The project will be a CASE partnership with Chester
Zoo. The supervisory team will include Tucker Gilman
and Susanne Shutlz (University of Manchester), Leah
Williams (Chester Zoo), and Jakob Bro-Jorgenson (Uni-
versity of Liverpool). For more information, email

UNamur Belgium EvolutionRotifers
*A PhD position is available to study extreme stress
responses inthe notorious bdelloid rotifers, UNamur,
Belgium*
A PhD position is available immediately to start work-
ing on the oxidative stress responses of bdelloid rotifers
following desiccation and radiation within the group of
Prof. Karine Van Doninck (Laboratory of Evolutionary
Genetics and Ecology) and Dr. Florence Chainiaux at
the University of Namur (Belgium).
While several metazoan asexual lineages exist, the most
notorious and successful clade is the bdelloid rotifers
containing at least 460 morphospecies that seems to
have evolved for tens of millions of years without sexual
reproduction (including fertilization and meiosis with
pairing of homologous chromosomes). Besidestheir asex-
ual mode of reproduction, they are also well-known for
their extreme desiccation and radiation resistance. En-
tering a desiccated state is however harmful in most
animals and is expected to be accompaniedby the gener-
ation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), known to induceJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 65
damages at the DNA, protein and lipid level if not neu-
tralized by antioxidants. This PhD project will study
and characterize in detail the oxidative stress generated
during desiccation and radiation in the model bdelloid
species Adineta vaga and investigate their antioxidant
responses. Being funded by the European Space Agency,
this Phd will also investigate the impact of simulated mi-
cro gravity on oxidative stress responses and be involved
in space mission preparation.
This PhD position is for 1 year and can start as soon
as February 1 ^st 2017, being funded by two projects,
ESA (European Space Agency) and ARC (Actions de
Recherche Concertees). An extension of another 3 years
ispossible but the candidate will be encouraged to apply
for its own FRIA orFNRS Belgian PhD grant.
Prof. Karine Van Doninck recently acquired an ERC
Consolidator Grant to study the mechanisms of genome
evolutionin the absence of meiosis in bdelloid rotifers;
this ERC CoG will start in 2017. This PhD will join a
very dynamic research lab including nowadays 5 post-
docs, 2 PhD students and 3 technicians at UNamur.
We employ interdisciplinary approaches (cellular and
molecular biology, comparative genomics, bioinformatics
and community level) to study evolutionary processes
in the absence of sex andthe mechanisms of extreme
resistances. Our team obtained the rst draft genome
of the bdelloid rotifer A. vaga (Flot etal2013 Nature),
we have optimized desiccation and radiation protocols
(Hespeels etal2014 JEB) and recently we discovered
horizontal gene transfer between A. vaga individuals
sampled in the wild (Debortoli etal2016 Current Bi-
ology). Our laboratory works in close collaboration
with Dr. F. Chainiaux at UNamur, studying ageing
and oxidative stress in human, with Prof. S. Lucas at
LARN (UNamur)for the radiation experiments, with
Prof. B. Hallet at UCL (Belgium) specialized in DNA

PhD in Epigenetic Theory
A PhD position is available within the Department of
Zoology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New
Zealand. This position in the laboratory of Professor
Hamish G. Spencer is funded by the Marsden Fund of
the Royal Society of New Zealand. A scholarship cover-
ing fees plus a tax-free stipend of NZ $27,500 per year is
available for three years.
The project is part of a larger project entitled \Epi-
genetics and Evolutionary Theory." Just as natural
populations exhibit genetic variation, so too do they
harbour epigenetic variation, some of which is trans-
mitted from one generation to the next. This project
asks how we can explain this transgenerationally in-
herited epigenetic variation in natural populations and
what might be the consequences for evolution. The can-
didate will construct and analyse novel mathematical
models to investigate these matters, validating these
models with data from real examples, and using the
models to make novel predictions about the properties
of epigenetic variation in nature.
The successful candidate will have a strong interest in ap-
plying quantitative methods in biology. They will have adegree in biology and/or mathematics (or a related eld)
that included a research component (e.g., a dissertation
or a thesis). The degree (e.g., BSc(Hons), MSc) will
have been awarded with rst-class honours/distinction.
Our research group and the wider Department includes
world-class research sta, facilities and strong interna-
tional collaborations, oering excellent opportunities to
gain a variety of highly pertinent research and technical
skills.

(Brisbane, Australia), are looking for a motivated PhD
candidate to work on the short-term shape evolution
in the skeleton of marsupial mammals.The candidate
will be a central part of an Australian Discovery Project
grant project. The work will contribute to the develop-
ment of evolutionary baselines for morphological shape
evolution in marsupial mammals, with particular focus
on the question of how quickly morphological shape
changes in the evolutionary short-term. Expected out-
comes include improved understanding of short-term vs.
long-term morphological evolution, and a novel statisti-
cal framework for analysing morphological data, which
allows fossils to be merged into the tree of life.
Essential skills for this position are prociency in R
(particularly the phylogenetics and geometric morpho-
metrics packages). Good spoken and written English is
also essential. Experience in vertebrate morphology and
virtual 3D visualization (e.g. using Meshlab, Mimics,
or Avizo) is an advantage. Experience in the eld ofJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 69
vertebrate evolution is also desirable but not essential.
Acceptance for this PhD is contingent on a success-
ful application for PhD funding, with half the fund-
ing coming from the Weisbecker/Phillips labs and the
other half from the School of Biological Sciences at
the University of Queensland. OVERSEAS APPLICA-
TIONS ARE ENCOURAGED. The next deadline for
international scholarships is in on January the 27th
for starting in June 2017; applicants with at least one
publication have particularly good chances of being
accepted. International applicants can apply before
conferral of their degree if the degree is conferred soon

of dispersal and motility in cultured cell lines
== Main Supervisors: Dr Louise Johnson, Uni-
versity of Reading (https://www.reading.ac.uk/-
biologicalsciences/about/sta/l-j-johnson.aspx); Prof
James Bullock, CEH (http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sta/-

sity of Bath (http://www.bath.ac.uk/bio-sci/contacts/-
academics/tiany-taylor/)
== Project description: Dispersal and its evolution are
central to ecology, impacting processes such as specia-
tion, the maintenance of genetic diversity, and adapta-
tion to changing environments. Extensive theory sup-
ports this view, but robust empirical data is lacking,
partly due to practical diculties with current model
organisms (Duputie & Massol, Interface Focus 3:0028,
2013). However, dispersal theories can be tested in the
lab with microbial models (K ummerli et al. Evolution
63:939-49, 2009; Taylor et al. J Evol Biol 26:2644-53,
2013). Key questions in dispersal depend on a) the
genetic and epigenetic basis of dispersal phenotypes,
and b) the connections between dispersal and normal
movement patterns during an organism's life. We seek
a student to address the evolution and genetics of dis-
persal using data from a novel model system: cultured
cell lines derived from human cancers. Cell lines share
advantages with microbes (Taylor et al. Evol. Appl. 6:
535-548, 2013): they are small, tractable, clonal, and can
be frozen down. Lines are available with varying motil-
ity and hence dispersal phenotypes. However, unlike
bacteria, cancer cells exhibit complex epigenetic control
of phenotype, and appear to show plastic dispersal. Low
nutrient environments can result in increased motility
both in the short term, presumably due to plasticity,
and longer term, which may be the result of selection
(T. Taylor, unpublished data). By tracking cells and
their descendants, we have found a high broad-sense
heritability of motility within cancer cell populations
in vitro (Wass et al. in prep.), showing that cell lines
should rapidly respond to selection on motility. This
oers an easily identiable phenotype on which to track
the evolution of dispersal traits. Cell motility is also a
key component of metastasis, which has been analogised
to dispersal, although there is debate over the extent to
which this analogy is helpful (Arnal et al. Evol. Appl.
8.6 (2015): 541-544)). The aim of this project is to assess
the utility of cancer cells as model systems for under-
standing the evolutionary ecology of dispersal with the
potential for complex epigenetic control, and to use em-
pirical data to generate robust evolutionary models that
can be generalised to other organisms. This multidisci-
plinary project, using data from in vivo and in vitro cell
tracking, will involve analysis of large datasets of cell be-
haviour and lines of descent, and agent-based modelling
informed and parameterised by real data. Using video
and image analysis, we will quantify variation within
populations and correlations between cell relatives, mea-
sure population-level responses to environmental change,
and examine patterns of motility inheritance. Statis-70 EvolDir January 1, 2017
tical modelling will help disentangle the inuences of
ancestry and environment (e.g. cell-maternal eects) on
motility. Modelling will involve agent-based simulations
and analytical methods to represent the evolution of cell
motility under realistic, complex genetic control. Evo-
lutionary processes will be modelled under alternative
micro-environments to assess the conditions which drive
disparate evolutionary pathways. Insights will be gained
into the role of genetic architecture in the evolution of
dispersal.

UReading FungalPathogenEvolution
The University and Reading, with Imperial College Lon-
don, UK invites applications for a PhD position in:
**Fungal pathogen evolution in a warming world: con-
sequences for human health and biodiversity**
Supervisors: Richard Walters and Mike Shaw at the
University of Reading, and Matthew Fisher at Imperial
College London.
The PhD student will study the thermal adaptation of
various important fungal pathogens involved in human
and wildlife disease, namely Batrachochytrium dendro-
batidis, a global amphibian pathogen causing amphibian
chytridiomycosis (Clare et al. 2016), Aspergillus fumi-
gatus, an opportunistic pathogen of plants and animalsincluding humans (Meis et al. 2016) and Fusarium oxys-
porum, an emerging crop disease. Recent phylogenetic
analyses reveals virulence is associated with warmer en-
vironments, reinforcing the view that fungal pathogens
were the driving evolutionary force behind vertebrate en-
dothermy, homeothermy and (arguably) the extinction
of the dinosaurs (Casadevall 2012). The successful ap-
plicant will establish the thermal performance of fungal
isolates using a novel 'gradient plate' and will explore
the evolutionary potential of pathogens under climate
change through the development of computer models
(e.g. Walters et al. 2012).
The project builds upon evolutionary epidemiology
projects currently funded by NERC where several hun-
dred isolates of these pathogens have already been iso-
lated ready for use. Main project aims are to: 1) relate
genetic variance in thermal performance e.g. thermal
optima and critical maximum temperature, to underly-
ing thermodynamic constraints and the selective envi-
ronment, 2) validate model predictions by quantifying
genetic variance for thermal performance curve biophys-
ical variables using a novel gradient plate approach on a)
hundreds of readily available genome-sequenced isolates
for B. dendrobatidis, A. fumigatus and F. oxysporum
and b) strains subject to laboratory evolution under
various thermal regimes, 3) identify genes associated
with isolate variation and their possible relationships
to biophysical variables and 4) review and adjust the
assumptions of the theoretical models given empirical
evidence.
The student will develop several skill sets identied as
'most wanted' in the biological and environmental sci-
ences by UK Research Councils, including modelling,
data management, numeracy and risk and uncertainty.
Specically, training will be provided in the following
areas: 1) mathematical biology and its application to
population genomics, enzyme kinetics and epidemiol-
ogy, 2) computer programming and its application to
Individual-Based Modelling, simulations and scenarios
and 3) statistically robust experimental design and prac-
tice.
We are seeking a strongly motivated person with BSc,
and ideally MSc degree, in biology or a related discipline.
The applicant should have good English language and
presentation skills. We provide training in modelling
and quantitative skills but the applicant should highlight
evidence of their enthusiasm and aptitude to learn them,
such as the type of data analyses undertaken in their
previous research projects or their use of R, for example.
Previous experience with fungi and experimental design
is an advantage.
The position is funded for 3.5 years (competitive fund-January 1, 2017 EvolDir 71
ing is obtained through the QMEE CDT). Stipend and
conditions are based on NERC PhD studentships. UK
residents (3&#43; years) are entitled to full funding and
tuition, EU applicants are entitled to partial funding.
Starting date is 1 October 2017.
If you are interested in this position, please send your
CV, along with a letter of motivation and the contact
details of two references as a single PDF to Richard
Walters (r.j.walters@reading.ac.uk). Deadline for appli-
cations is 19 January 2017. For questions, please use
the same email address as above.
The University of Reading and Imperial College Lon-
don are strong advocates of equality and diversity in
research and teaching and particularly encourage women
to apply.

URhodeIsland
BiodiversityGenomics
The Lane Lab at the University of Rhode Island is invit-
ing PhD applicants to work on a recently funded NSF
GoLife project. The focus of the project is diversity
and genomics within the Stramenopiles, Alveolates and
Rhizaria - largely microbial eukaryotic taxa that are
underrepresented in traditional databases.The bulk of eukaryotic diversity is microbial and, when
compared to plants, animals and fungi, much of this
microbial diversity has been undersampled from the
standpoint of morphological, phylogenetic and genomic
data. This skew in data not only has consequences
for our understanding of the biodiversity of eukaryotic
life on Earth, but also how we interpret cellular and
evolutionary biology in the broadest sense. One of the
most diverse major clades of eukaryotes that has re-
cently emerged from phylogenomic analyses united the
Stramenopila, Alveolata and Rhizaria into the 'SAR'
group.
Initially this clade was controversial because it forced a
re-evaluation of the evolution of several characters, most
notably the spread of photosynthesis across eukaryotes.
However, additional data have robustly supported SAR
as an independent clade. Among the diverse lineages
within SAR, genomic-scale data are rare and concen-
trated in only a few areas, Apicomplexa (e.g. malarial
parasites), omycetes (e.g.
parasite 'water molds') and diatoms (e.g. ecologically
important phytoplankton). Despite their global ecologi-
cal importance, fewer than 50% of all SAR clades, and
only one third of non-photosynthetic SAR clades, are
represented by even a single genome in public databases.
This work will add at least 250 novel genomic-scale
datasets (transcriptomes, draft genomes, single-cell am-
plied genomes), focused primarily on capturing diver-
sity within SAR.

University of Sheeld
Closing date: 6th January
We are looking for a student with advanced numerical
skills and an interest in both biology and physics to
work on a project predicting genomic eects on struc-
tural colour. Structural colours, caused by diraction
or interference of light from nano-scale structures, are
some of the brightest and most impressive colours in
nature. There has been extensive interest in replicat-
ing structural colours, which are produced from simple
biological materials that are cheap and non-toxic, and
can also have unique properties such as angle dependent
colour (iridescence). However, very little is known about
how the patterning of such ne structures is controlled
in biological systems and the genetic pathways control-
ling this have yet to be identied in any system. This
project would use genomic data from Heliconius but-
teries from South America to predict how individual
genetic loci control specic aspects of structural varia-
tion. The project will involve computational modelling
approaches, rstly to predict ne structural characteris-
tics from small angle x-ray scattering data and secondly
to predict this morphology from genotype.
The candidate should have a background or training
in physics, maths or computer science; or advanced nu-
merical skills from a biology background (e.g. through
masters-level training). Some experience or training
in data analysis or programming would be ideal. The
student should have the enthusiasm to get to grips with
concepts from both biology and physics. Interested
candidates are encouraged to contact either of the su-
pervisors with informal enquiries.
This project is funded through The Leverhulme Cen-
tre for Advanced Biological Modeling (CABM). Stu-
dentships are fully funded for 3 years including fees (at
UK/EU rate) and a stipend at the standard RCUK
rate (currently pounds 14,296, rising slightly each year).
These projects are available to UK, EU and overseas
applicants, but funding for tuition fees will be pro-vided to successful applicants at the UK/EU rate. This
means that students from outside the EU will need an-
other source of funding to cover the dierence between

The genetics of how environmental uctuation ac-
celerates the ageing process Supervisors: Dr Mirre
Simons (University of Sheeld), Dr Sean Sweeney
(University of York) https://acce.shef.ac.uk/the-
genetics-of-how-environmental-uctuation-accelerates-
the-ageing-process/ Global warming has changed
the average environment experienced by organisms
but has also increased environmental variability.
Even if organisms are able to adapt to a sudden
change in average environmental conditions, rapidly
uctuating ecological conditions are predicted to impose
severe constraints on biodiversity. Indeed, we have
recently found that uctuating the diet content of ies
(Drosophila melanogaster) can dramatically speed up
the ageing process. This novel nding indicates severe
physiological costs of uctuations in the diet and opens
up the rst possibility to understand these costs in
detail. The powerful genetics readily available in ies
now allows a rapid and deep insight into these processes
with high relevance to understanding how diet impacts
on organisms.
You will use a combination of approaches in ies to
uncover the physiology responsible for the observed
vulnerability to uctuation in the diet. Through screen-
ing a large number of lines for the dietary phenotype,
genes regulating this physiology can be implicated us-
ing genome-wide association analysis. Such genes can
then be manipulated in ies to test whether they are
regulating causal physiology. Further experiments can
then elucidate the exact physiology responsible. The
wealth of dierent genetic lines of ies available in dedi-January 1, 2017 EvolDir 73
cated stock centres means that many intricate genetic
manipulations are only one or a few crosses away.
Recent work on the connection between ageing and diet
has suggested that the reward centre in the brain might
be key in regulating the valuation of diet and thereby
ageing. Such neuronal processes could, therefore, be an
important part of how organisms cope with uctuating
environments. You will test the involvement of these
brain areas in how ies respond to uctuations in their
diet. With the expertise oered by supervisor Dr Sean
Sweeney, you will be able to directly test the connections
between neuronal cell biology, accelerated ageing and
diet.
We seek a hard-working passionate student with a quan-
titative mindset and an interest in the biology of ageing.
Candidates with a diverse background in life science
will be considered. The broad scientic expertise of
the supervisors ensures a vibrant environment for the
student. We will empower the student to pursue his/her
own interests and acquire a wide array of skills. Your
research will not only have implications for how we un-
derstand a key process in evolution and conservation,
but also for biomedical science in which ageing research
and in particular the connection to diet is growing in
importance.

Adapt, move or perish? Identifying syndromes of popula-
tion structure to predict species' responses to a changing
environment
We are seeking a highly motivated individual to carry
out PhD research at the University of Stirling that will
bridge the research elds of population biology, global
change biology and macroecology.
Climate change is already having profound eects on the
spatial distribution of many species. To ensure broad
coverage, studies often treat species as uniform entities
and generate predictions of a species' overall ability to
adapt, move or perish. However, the population is the
unit that will respond to a changing climate, therefore
making robust predictions on emergent species-level re-
sponses should ideally involve consideration of how the
populations that make up a species' range are structured.
Population structure has been quantied for individual
species, but these data are rarely synthesised across
species to identify common syndromes: a main aim of
this project.
This is an ambitious PhD project that has the scope
to generate novel and signicant insights on the role
of population structure in determining species' range
dynamics. It will combine generation of a large and
unique cross-species dataset of measures of population
structure and its potential drivers (from existing litera-
ture) with sophisticated modelling techniques to identify
syndromes and make predictions on emergent species-
level responses. It will suit a quantitatively-minded
student with a biological background. For more in-74 EvolDir January 1, 2017

*Project description:*
Britain's forests oer key habitat for woodland species;
however, maintaining biodiversity under the demands
of timber production can be challenging. The highly
fragmented nature of British woodlands is a further
challenge because fragmentation leads to isolation, usu-
ally reducing genetic diversity of woodland dwelling
species, particularly in species with poor dispersal abil-
ities and exacting habitat requirements such as woodants (*Formica rufa* group). These species, threatened
across Europe, are key components of woodland ecosys-
tems and oer an ideal study system to explore the
impact of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of
a woodland species.
This study will clarify the conservation status of a ge-
netically unusual wood ant population in the North
York Moors (NYM) and will use wood ants to study
how dispersal and habitat fragmentation inuence the
formation of hybrids and new species. We will do this by
comparing the genetic diversity of the NYM population
to samples from across the UK and Eurasia. The data
will explain what creates the unusually high diversity
in the NYM and allow investigation of how wood ants
spread and diversied at the continental scale after the
last glacial period.
*Research team* The collaboration involves the Uni-
versity of York, CASE partner Forest Research, and a
project partner (University of Helsinki). The supervi-
sory team provide a range of skills, including genetic
techniques, eldwork skills, landscape analysis, and
expertise in forest management and invertebrate ecol-
ogy/evolution. This combination oers a challenging
and well-supported training environment and enables
the student to acquire a diverse skill-set with excellent
employment prospects.
*Applications* The results of our research will set the
NYM wood ant population in its broader European
context which will inform foresters, including Forestry
Commission practitioners, and DEFRA policy-makers,
in the development of appropriate management strate-
gies for the conservation and promotion of this key
woodland species group.

We are looking for a motivated student who is inter-

Population Epigenomics, Phenotypic Plasticity, and En-
vironmental Adaptation
Bernhard Schmid (EBES), Ueli Grossniklaus (IPMB)
Despite the heritability of epigenetic variation (EV),
its ecological and evolutionary signicance is largely
unknown and being controversially discussed [1-3]. In
plants, epigenetic changes can be heritable over genera-
tions [e.g. 4,5] and occur more frequently than genetic
ones [6,7]. Thus EV may allow rapid responses and
has the potential to play a key role in the adaptation
to environmental change. However, published results
are contradictory, possibly because very small samplenumbers were molecularly analyzed and experimental
replication is insucient [discussed in 3,8,9]. Over the
last years, we have collected experimental data demon-
strating a role for epigenetics in the response to changes
in the biotic and abiotic environment using Arabidopsis
thaliana as a model. We could demonstrate the selec-
tion of new, stable phenotypes in genetically uniform
backgrounds in independent, replicated selection experi-
ments, suggesting a role of EV in adaptation [see also
10]. The results, however, depended on the experimen-
tal set-up: while we found no evidence for a role in
adaptation when starting with seeds from a single indi-
vidual, stable phenotypes were selected when starting
with seeds derived from a population. Although mate-
rials and selection scenarios used where highly diverse,
this nding indicates that there is standing EV in ge-
netically uniform populations that can be selected upon
but that the rate of epigenetic change from generation
to generation is too low to generate sucient variation
when starting from an individual. We will test this
hypothesis in a highly replicated experiment involving
3 genotypes in 3 environments that should help to set-
tle the controversy on the ecological and evolutionary
signicance of epigenetic variation.

Tanzania 12mnths
PrimateProjectManager
The position requires a command of evolutionary theory
and behaviour given the scope of our work, but it is a
project manager position, so lots else is required as well.
Position Description: The Ugalla Primate Project is
seeking a project manager, to be based in a remote
eld site in western Tanzania for 12 months. Respon-
sibilities include overall Project coordination, manage-
ment of data collection for multiple ongoing studies

UPP administration concerning ongoing Project devel-
opments. Finally, s/he assists especially the logistics of
incoming collaborators/students, and often negotiates
complex relationships with government institutions and
local government ocials, e.g. Immigration.
If desired, the successful applicant may also conduct
an independent research project of his/her own design,
contingent on approval from UPP as well as Tanzanian
government research bodies.
Qualications: A successful candidate should have a
bachelor's degree in a related eld (evolutionary biology,
zoology, biological anthropology), with a strong com-
mand of evolutionary theory and behaviour, as well as
prior living or work experience in a developing country
(preferably in Africa), be extremely t, able to drive a
manual 4x4 vehicle, familiar with Microsoft Excel and
Word (GIS a plus), and willing to learn KiSwahili. Ad-
ditionally, the candidate must be responsible, organized,
independent, resourceful, and get along well and easilywith others, as the position requires long periods in the
forest with a team of Tanzanian eld assistants. The
landscape is demanding, and so extreme physical tness
is also critical. Previous experience with apes is sought,
but not necessary.
Duration: February 2017 - January 2018 (dates exible).
Compensation: USD300 per month, with in-country
& work-related expenses covered by the Project. Can-
didates must be prepared to pay international travel
and government research permits (USD2200) up front.

Full professor Population and Evolutionary Biology Fac-
ulty of Science - Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Dynamics
Level of education: PhD Salary indication: euro 5,260
to euro 7,659 gross per month Closing date: 11 February
2017 Hours: 38 hours per week Vacancy number: 16-593
The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynam-
ics (IBED) is one of the eight research institutes of
the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam.
IBED was founded in 2000 by merging research groups
with expertise in ecology, physical geography, environ-
mental microbiology and environmental chemistry. The
research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems func-
tion in all their complexity, and how they change due
to natural processes and human activities. At its core
lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiver-
sity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts
this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic
(soil and water quality) and biotic factors (presence,
population dynamics and functioning of plants, animals,
microbes), and the interplay between these ecosystem
components. The IBED vision includes that research
encompasses experimental and theoretical approaches
at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e.
from microbes and individual behaviour to patterns and
processes occurring at landscape scale. IBED oers
advanced and up-to-date research facilities, such as a
greenhouse, growth chambers, an electrophysiological
lab, a molecular lab, an analytical chemistry lab, a
soil erosion lab, a GIS studio, and high-performance
computing facilities.
IBED is in search of a new full professor for the depart-ment of Population and Evolutionary Biology (PEB).
We are looking for a scientist who has the ambition to
lead a diverse research group. Someone who inspires
the PEB team, represents the group and increases the
international academic visibility of PEB. Someone who
has a talent for, and a clear vision on university teaching
and research. We welcome a candidate who brings in
new approaches, research skills or model systems.
The department of Population and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Research of the new department of Population and
Evolutionary Biology aims at improved understanding
of how interactions between individuals and their bi-
otic and abiotic environment aect population dynamics
and evolutionary processes, which ultimately determine
speciation and biodiversity patterns. Research is in-
tegrative, combining insights from population ecology,
community ecology, and evolutionary biology. The Pop-
ulation and Evolutionary Biology department also per-
forms applied research on questions relevant for society.
At present, the department of Population and Evolu-
tionary Biology consists of 10 permanent academic sta
members, 10 Postdocs,18 PhD students and 4 techni-
cal sta. The department plays an important role in
teaching and coordinates a wide range of BSc and MSc
courses. The department will comprise the three cur-
rent chair groups of Population Biology, Evolutionary
Biology and Experimental Plant Systematics.
Current research of PEB is organized along 4 lines: -
chemical and molecular basis of adaptation and speci-
ation; - adaptive intraspecic variation in exploitation
strategies of herbivores and predators; - direct and in-
direct interactions among plants, predators and prey; -
biodiversity and conservation.
Members of the department of Population and Evo-
lutionary Biology collaborate extensively with other
research groups within IBED. Within the University
of Amsterdam, we work together with colleagues from
the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences and the
Center for Research in Experimental Economics and
Political Decision Making. The department of Popula-
tion and Evolutionary Biology also collaborates with
many other national and international institutes and
non-academic stakeholders. In particular, we focus on
increased collaboration with the related department of
Animal Ecology of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
Together, these two groups aim to become a leading
center for evolutionary and ecological research.
Job description The new full professor will chair the
department of Population and Evolutionary Biology,
will develop her/his own research program, and will
contribute to the teaching program. The full professor90 EvolDir January 1, 2017

as sh, birds, rodents, marine mammals and humans.
Our institute is the driving force of the Adaptive Life
Programme, one of four integrative focus research areas
of the FMNS.
To further strengthen Adaptive Life, the University of
Groningen and FMNS enabled us to hire for 5 new fac-
ulty and 25 PhD scholarship positions, as well as to
invest in large scale new facilities. This support also fa-
cilitated the establishment of the Sustainable Landscape
Competence Centre and the Brain and Behavioural Com-

funds and further organize our outreach.
GELIFES has a vacancy for a tenure track assistant or
associate professor in Evolutionary Ecology of Marine
Animals
Candidates are expected to set up an independent re-
search line within this eld, complementary to ongoing
research of the institute. The candidate is expected to
have an interest in strengthening the research program
and faculty theme called Adaptive Life in which bio-
logical adaptation is studied by integrating mechanistic
with evolutionary approaches. Candidates are expected
to attract funding for new PhD projects and attain a
leading international position in the eld. They are
excellent teachers who can attract students of dierent
disciplines and have an interest in teaching at both the
bachelor, master and PhD level.
Research on larger marine animal species that provide
opportunities for collaboration not only with ecologists
or evolutionary biologists of the institute but also with
its behavioural physiologists / neurobiologists is appre-
ciated but not a requirement.
The Netherlands border both the North Sea and the
Wadden Sea, the latter being relatively close to the
university. Research in the North Sea and Wadden
Sea currently provides good funding opportunities and
contributes to the regional impact of our university,
but researchers working on other ecosystems are also
encouraged to apply.
The University of Groningen has adopted an active pol-
icy to increase the number of female scientists across
all disciplines of the university. Therefore, female candi-
dates are especially encouraged to apply.

LabManager
Noninvasive Genetics Lab Manager at UW Seattle
The School of Environmental and Forest Sciences at
the University of Washington has created a new shared
genetics lab directed by Dr. Laura Prugh. We seek
an experienced individual to help get the lab up and
running, supervise and train lab users, and to carry
out noninvasive genotyping projects. Current projects
include studies of interactions among a variety of carni-
vores (wolves, cougars, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, shers)
and ungulates in Alaska and Washington using DNA
obtained from scats, puncture wounds, and snow tracks.
Other users of the lab may work on varied projects,
including those focused on soils, plants, microbes, or
other wildlife. We are currently setting up the lab with
new equipment, including a droplet digital PCR system
that will facilitate cutting edge eDNA work. The lab
manager will work independently to arrange equipment,
purchase supplies, train and supervise graduate and
undergraduate students while in the lab, run genetic
analyses, and lead or contribute to publications. The
lab manager will be fully integrated into the Prugh lab
wildlife ecology research group, with the possibility of
assisting with projects outside the lab (e.g., eldwork).
See http://www.prughlab.com/ for more about what
we do.

Isabelle Olivieri
Isabelle Olivieri has left us on Saturday 10 December
at 4 am. She passed away quietly after having fought
with an admirable courage against her cancer but also
against a paraneoplasic syndrome, which heavily handi-
capped her for the last years of her life. Isabelle would
have passed 60 years in March 2017. She entered the
Agronomic College (AgroParisTech) in Paris in 1977,
specialized in zoology and then oriented her research
towards evolutionary genetics. Her PhD work concerned
Mediterranean thistles. These plants were invasive in
Australia and one of the goals of the CSIRO where she
was based in Montpellier was to nd control agents.
She will come back to the question of plant-insect in-
teractions later in her life. She did her Post-Doc in
Paul Ehrlich's lab in Stanford in 1983 and there, further
developed her ideas on the importance of the metapop-
ulation concept for the understanding of the evolution
of migration mechanisms. The paper which she will
publish on this subject in American Naturalist (after a
more than 4 years debate with the editors) will provide
her with a congratulation letter from Ernst Mayr (this
letter is probably somewhere in her \records", Isabelle
has never been very gifted for ordering, her papers as
the rest!).
Hired at the INRA (Agronomic Research Institute) in a
laboratory near Montpellier on a programme concerningMediterranean Alfalfa, predominantly annuals, she de-
veloped her research on the evolution of genetic systems
by studying the evolutionary mechanisms determining
the lifespan of organisms according to their ecology. Her
DSc thesis will treat of the constitution of an integrative
approach of evolution uniting demographic and genetic
models on both migration and longevity characters.
Hired as full Professor at Montpellier, she became the
rst professor in Population Genetics at Montpellier
and set up high level courses. She carried on with her
quest of evolutionary mechanisms by coming back to
thistles and their insects. She studied habitat choice,
host specicity, realised a leading study on the Conser-
vation Biology of a local Centaurea, again in relation
with the metapopulation concept, and developed exper-
imental evolution studies . The list of questions which
she tackled with her team or with diverse collaborators
would be too long to be detailed here.
Isabelle also became a recognized actor of international
evolutionary biology. John Maynard Smith has once
said that she was the fth column[1] of the French evo-
lutionary biology into the anglo-saxon world. Indeed,
she will become president of the European Society of
Evolutionary Biology, vice president of the American
Society for the Study of Evolution, the Dutch Academy
of sciences will attribute her a comfortable grant allow-
ing her to come whenever and wherever she wishes in
any University to interact with local scientists, she will
belong to the editorial board of numerous journals, the
French Society of Ecology will give her its \grand prix"
and CNRS its silver medal. Despite all those recog-
nition proofs, Isabelle did not search for honours nor
for responsibilities. Actually, she would rather make
her best to escape from them. She however used all
opportunities to defend her convictions and transmit
messages. Invited by the French president to a lunch
with other female scientists, she gave an interview to a
newspaper criticizing his policy for scientic research.
In her national and international activities, Isabelle has
established sustainable and fruitful cooperative relation-
ships and tried to gather ideas and people together,
bring demography and genetics, ecology and evolution
together . It was undoubtedly one of the causes of her
charisma, of the fact that a number of us were ready to
follow her even on steep paths, just like the Corsican
ones she liked so much.
When she passed her DSc, Georges Valdeyron, who had
supervised her PhD and who was 45 older than her,
stated that the students he was interacting with were
a bit like his progeny but that his relation with her
was dierent; actually she had been more like a nursing
mother. From that point of view, in a way, we, French
evolutionary biologists, are orphans today. The one whoJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 107
dared say things which should not be told, who disputed
ercely, step by step let us admit it, it was sometimes
painful any opinion which she did not nd rational, the
one who oriented the research of a lot of us and who
was an example for many, has disappeared. If Isabelle
could be severe, brusque sometimes, all of those who
have known her have beneted from her exceptional
generosity and from her care for collective actions. Her
involvement at the collective level has led those who
worked with her to establish deep aective relations
with her and to build this large family, of which she is
the soul, and which will remain united now that she is
gone. Her house she shared with her companion was
widely open and innumerable

Modelling recombination in prokaryote phylogenomics
Xavier Didelot Imperial College London Monday, Jan-
uary 23, 2017, 9:00 AM PST
Recombination happens frequently in most bacterial
and archaeal species. Traditional phylogenetic tech-
niques do not account for this, which can greatly limit
their usefulness for the analysis of genomic data. The
coalescent with gene conversion accurately models the
ancestry process of prokaryotes, and this can be used
to simulate realistic data, but it is too complex to use
in an inferential setting. Approximations have therefore
been introduced, which are centred around the concept
of the clonal genealogy, that is the phylogeny obtained
by following the line of ancestry of the recipient of each
recombination event. I will review these mathematical
models and ongoing eorts to develop statistical soft-
ware to perform phylogenomic analysis in recombining
prokaryotes.

Seeking GBS facilities
Dear Evoldir members
In our group we seek to use GBS of restriction-enzyme
reduced genomes to nd SNPs for population genetics
of non-model organisms. We are aware of patent prob-
lems when using this technique, that's why I would like
advice about facilities or companies that are adequately
licensed and that oer the service of library preparation(with preliminary enzyme checking and selection) and
sequencing. Infos about prices are also welcome
Thanks for your answers, I will prepare a post with
them

WillametteU VolField
YuccaCoevolution
The Smith lab at Willamette University is soliciting
applications for volunteers to participate in eld re-
search studying the pollination biology and coevolutionof Joshua trees (*Yucca brevifolia*) and yucca moths
(genus *Tegeticula*) from mid March to mid April of
2017. Volunteers will assist in the completion of polli-
nation experiments in a plant hybrid zone located in
central Nevada, which will involve collecting ower and
leaf tissue samples, installing pollinator exclusion cages
over Joshua tree owers, collecting moths, and sorting
insects to species. All travel, food, and accommodation
costs will be covered by the project.
Participation will require living at a remote eld camp
continuously for approximately four weeks. Meals are
communal, prepared in a small RV kitchen, and evenings
are typically spent around the camp re. Many past
participants have returned for additional years, and
many have used the experience gained on this project
to secure other positions in agency, private conserva-
tion organizations, and graduate programs in ecology,
evolution, and entomology.
However, prospective participants should be aware that
conditions in the eld are challenging. The eld site has
no running water. Apart from personal tents and walks
in the desert there is little opportunity for personal
space and time, and there are no cell phone/internet
services at the eld site. (Wi and cell service are avail-
able in the nearest town, a 30-minute drive away). Daily
temperatures may drop below freezing or exceed 90 F.
Wind and sandstorms are very common. So, it is impor-
tant that prospective volunteers be enthusiastic about
living and working closely with others in challenging
conditions. Volunteers should also be capable of hiking
up to 6 miles per day while carrying heavy and awkward
loads, and able to climb a 6' ladder.
Prospective volunteers should submit a CV or resume,
the name and contact information for one or more profes-
sional references, and a letter describing their interest in
the project by email to csmith@willamette.edu . There
is no degree requirement, but a familiarity with and an
interest in ecology and natural history are necessary.
Please include the words 'Volunteer Field Assistant' in
the subject line of your message.
Screening of applicants will begin on January 15th, 2017,
and continue until all positions are lled.

Job description: A two years post doc position is avail-
able at UMR BIOGECO. Starting date as soon as pos-
sible or as agreed upon.
The general goal of the research will be to conduct
genome wide exploration of evolutionary changes that
occurred in recent times in European white oaks. Investi-
gations will be conducted on whole genome resequencing
data of extant populations sampled along geographic
gradients or known historical trajectories. The aim willJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 115
be to disentangle changes associated to demographic
events, admixture with other related species, and nat-
ural selection. Special emphasis will be given to the
detection of evolutionary changes over short time scales
(last 3-4 centuries). This research is part of a larger
ERC project investigating rates of genomic and phe-
notypic changes based on allochronic and synchronic
approaches (http://www.treepeace.fr/).

homology is limited only to few groups of reptiles (eg.
iguanas, advanced snakes), while the majority of reptil-
ian lineages remain unstudied. The successful candidate
will collaborate with the other team members and will
study the evolution of sex chromosomes in a multidi-
rectional approach, involving cytogenetics (eg. FISH,
chromosome painting), molecular genetics (eg. qPCR)
and bioinformatics (eg. transcriptomics). More informa-
tion about our current research activity can be found

Evolutionary and ecological processes driving parasite
speciation
Description of the project:
This is a project on how species radiations aect inter-
specic interactions, such as host- parasite associations.
Analogous to how a diverse habitat can support a di-
verse community of free-living species and lead to species
radiations, a species-rich or genetically divergent pool120 EvolDir January 1, 2017
of hosts may provide variable but resource-rich habitats
that may promote diverse parasite communities and in
some instances, parasite species radiations.
The aims of this project are: 1. to test general ecology
theory regarding whether parasite diversity follows the
habitat heterogeneity hypothesis 2. to develop general
theory for the interplay of ecological and evolutionary
processes promoting parasite diversication in an inter-
species interaction context
The model system used to address the theoretical frame-
work above will be whiteshes and their parasite com-
munities in Swiss and Scandinavian lakes.
A major part of the research will involve eldwork in
Norwegian and Swiss lakes, parasitological examination
of sh and morphological characterisation of parasites.
This will be followed by community ecology analyses,
extensive population genomic [single- nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs)] of parasites and phylogeography
analyses.
The position involves working closely with eld assis-
tants and students at dierent institutions.

We seek a theory-driven postdoc to join us to focus on
questions related to evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy and genomics including the genetic and epigenetic
basis of phenotypic change. We oer a highly interdis-
ciplinary group and generous funding support from a
recently awarded NERC Highlight topics grant to Dr
Kevin J. Parsons (PI), Prof. Neil B. Metcalfe, Dr Shaun
S. Killen and Dr Jan Lindstrom.
The project provides an opportunity to take evo-devo
and genomics in a new direction by investigating the
impact that long-term increases in temperature can
have on evolution. The postdoc will be in charge of
leading and applying large-scale population genomic
and QTL mapping approaches to sticklebacks that have
evolved within geothermally-heated and ambient tem-
perature locations in Iceland. A substantial portion
of this research will also involve the use of genomics
to understand patterns of methylation in response to
temperature in both wild and lab-reared populations.
While these genomic approaches will be used, the lab
is phenotype-rst orientated and works at the intersec-
tions of ecology, evolution, physiology, and development.
The postdoc will therefore also have the opportunity to
take part in the design of experiments used to assess
developmental changes in a range of phenotypes.
You will have previous postdoc experience or be near
to completing a relevant PhD and be experienced with
genomics, developmental genetics, and/or epigenetics.
Interest and experience with questions surrounding par-
allel evolution and phenotypic plasticity would be an
asset. As part of a team funded by this NERC grant, you
will work closely with another postdoctoral scientist who
will focus on running lab experiments and behavioural
assays, and a full-time technician who will aid in the
running of a breeding programme and lab work.January 1, 2017 EvolDir 121
Passion for research, team spirit and enthusiasm are
essential. Our team is multidisciplinary with additional
major projects funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (ERC) and NERC. Additional PhD student projects
in the lab of the PI involve collaborations with engi-
neers, statisticians, and physicists demonstrating the
highly active and collaborative research environment
in the University of Glasgow. Further information on
the post can be obtained from Dr. Kevin Parsons

evolutionary adaptation.
Monash University Melbourne Australia
The Opportunity
Research in Damian Dowling's laboratory is focused on
the role the mitochondrial genome plays in evolutionary
adaptation and in the evolution of sex dierences. Ma-
ternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome renders
the mitochondrial DNA vulnerable to the accumulation
of mutations that are harmful to males, but neutral or
benecial to females.
We seek a talented and highly-motivated postdoctoral
researcher to join our laboratory group, to study the con-tribution that mitochondrial genetic variation makes to
mediating sex-specic trajectories of life-history evolu-
tion. The project will integrate experimental techniques
in evolutionary ecology, genomics and evolutionary phys-
iology.
As the successful candidate, you will have a PhD degree,
a record of publication in international journals, and
strong quantitative or bioinformatic skills. You will have
opportunities to develop and pursue your own research
interests within the bounds of the advertised project,
and to co-supervise undergraduate and Master's level
research projects within the Dowling group.

Position summary:
The Evolutionary Genomics Unit is seeking for a post-
doctoral researcher with skills in insect ecology and
evolution, and with ability to analyze high through-
put sequencing data. The researcher will work around
on one or more of these promising topics: molecular
evolution of the symbiosis between insects and microor-
ganisms, molecular phylogenetic of insects, historical
biogeography of termites, and molecular mechanisms ofinsect defense.
Position:
The Evolutionary Genomics Unit is a research group
recently established at OIST with interests in evolution
of insects in general. Our main research topics include
molecular evolution of the symbiosis between insects
and microorganisms, molecular phylogenetic of insects,
historical biogeography of termites, and molecular mech-
anisms of insect defense. We address all these themes
using high throughput sequencing. We are looking for
a postdoctoral candidate with extensive experience in
high throughput sequencing and who is keen to work
on one of our insect models: cockroaches or termites.
The candidate is expected to work in collaboration with
members of the Evolutionary Genomics Unit, and she/he
will be given relative independence to develop her/his
own research within the frame of the Unit's research
agenda.
Some possible research topics include, but are not re-
stricted to:
- Studying the role of termite gut microorganisms in
soil-feeding termites using metagenomic analyses. Many
species of termites feed on soil but they are not studied
as intensively as wood-feeding termites. Metagenomics
can help us understanding the function of these microor-
ganisms.
- Studying the evolution of genome reduction in the cock-
roach endosymbiont Blattabacterium. Most cockroaches
are associated with Blattabacterium, a bacterium that
recycles nitrogen wastes and provides amino acid to their
host. The number of genes varies between strains of
Blattabacterium, and one question is therefore what are
the factors responsible of gene erosion in some strains?
- Studying the historical biogeography of termites using
molecular phylogenies. Termites are distributed world-
wide and often make up a large part of animal biomass
in the tropics. We are studying the origin of their dis-
tribution using mitochondrial genome phylogenies, to
determine the timing and direction of their spread across
the globe.

ModellingEvodevo
Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Modelling Evolution-
ary Processes (eco-evo-devo) (2 posts)
Dept Computer Science/Institute for Life Sciences Uni-
versity of Southampton, UK
We welcome applications for two postdoctoral re-
searchers in the area of 'evolutionary systems biology'
at the lab of Richard Watson at the University of
Southampton. Two positions are available, each for
a duration of two years, starting June 1st 2017.
The positions are part of a (7.7M) umbrella projectwhich aims to put to the test the predictions of the
extended evolutionary synthesis (Laland et al. 2015,
PRSB, 282:1813). The two positions available at
Southampton will build on recent developments uni-
fying evolutionary theory with learning theory (Watson
& Szathmary, 2016, TREE, 31(2), 147-157). This work
converts theoretical tools of learning systems, already
well-developed in computer science, to deepen and ex-
pand our understanding of natural evolution. Both
positions will use computational and/or mathematical
modelling to explore the adaptive capabilities of dif-
ferent functional processes and dierent assumptions
about the processes of and feedbacks within natural se-
lection: the selective conditions in which it takes place,
the variation on which it can act, and the heritability
of that variation. We focus on modelling how these
components of the Darwinian Machine (i.e. selection,
variation and inheritance) change over time as a func-
tion of past evolution. Themes addressed within these
projects include:
* The evolution of developmental organisations, plas-
ticity, and evolvability (evo-devo). * The evolution of
ecological organisations, collective function and niche
construction in ecosystems (evo-eco). * The evolution
of reproductive organisations and transitions in individ-
uality (evo-ego).
Co-investigators include John Odling-Smee (Oxford),
Michael Wade (Indiana), Andrew Gardner (St Andrews),
Charlie Cornwallis (Lund), Kevin Laland (St Andrews),
Gunter Wagner (Yale) and Tobias Uller (Lund). As a
part of this team, the candidates will also work closely
with several PhDs dedicated to this project and on
related projects.
The successful candidates will build mathemati-
cal/simulation models to develop our understanding
of how ecological, developmental and reproductive feed-
backs alter evolutionary dynamics and test the utility of
learning theory to characterise them. Appropriate skill
sets include gene-expression dynamics/gene-regulation
network modelling, ecological dynamics/community net-
work modelling, theoretical population genetics, math-
ematical modelling of biological evolution, social evo-
lution theory, comparative phylogenetics, theoretical
quantitative genetics, adaptive dynamics, evolutionary
game theory, computational individual-based modelling,
complex adaptive systems, algorithmic/functional mod-
elling of evolutionary adaptation.
Applicants must have a PhD in a relevant subject and
be capable of building bridges that link between evolu-

*Call for applications for a 17 months Postdoctoral Fel-
lowship on \Evolution of genomes in the genus /Rosa/"
at the Research Institute in Horticulture and Seeds
(Angers, France)*
//
A 17-months postdoctoral researcher position is
available at the University of Angers (France). The
project is a collaboration between the \Research
Institute of Horticulture and Seeds" in Angers, astride
two teams \Genetics and Diversity of Ornamentals"
(GDO, http://www6.angers-nantes.inra.fr/irhs eng/-
Research/GDO) and \Bioinformatics" (BioInfo,January 1, 2017 EvolDir 129
http://www6.angers-nantes.inra.fr/irhs eng/Research/-
BioInfo), and the group of Pr Thomas Debener from the
\Institute for Plant Genetics" at the Leibniz University
of Hannover (Germany; http://www.genetik.uni-
hannover.de/index.html?&L=3D1). The project will be
a bio-informatic analysis of the evolution of genomes
in the genus /Rosa/, at two levels: (/i/) the research
of structural variants (SVs), and (/ii/) the study of
the evolution of resistance gene families (see details
below). Applications are open for candidates who did
not have spent more than 12 months in France within
the last 3 years immediately prior to the expected date
of recruitment. The net salary (after taxes) is 2409.58
/month. The opportunity to apply for AgreenSkills
programmes (https://www.agreenskills.eu/) may allow
to increase this salary. The beginning of the contract is
expected for February or March 2017. The postdoctoral
researcher will be based in Angers, regularly cited
as the most pleasant city to live in France, and at
proximity to the Loire Valley. Travels are planned
between Angers and Hanover.
*Summary of the project: *The rose bush is the most
economically important ornamental plant and the model
plant for many studies about ornamental traits (ow-
ering, fragrance, disease resistance). The rose bush,
constituting the genus /Rosa/, has a complex evolu-
tionary history with interspecic hybridization events
and polyploidizations. Little information about these
events is presently available, mainly hypotheses drawn
from sparse molecular markers. Recently, as part of an
international consortium, co-coordinated by the GDO
team, the rst version of the genome sequence of a va-
riety of rose (/Rosa chinensis/ cv. 'Old Blush') has
been obtained. In this genomic context, we propose
to study the evolutionary history of the genus /Rosa/
by resequencing dierent species of the genus /Rosa/.
*The objective is to understand the evolution of genomes
in the genus /Rosa/*, and especially to focus on the
processes that led to the creation of wild species, includ-
ing polyploid ones, which are at the base of cultivated
modern roses. From short reads (paired-end) obtained
from dierent representative /Rosa/ species involved
in cultivated rose breeding, (/i/) the research of struc-
tural variants (SVs as insertions, deletions, duplications,
inversion, translocations ) , and (/ii/) the study of the
evolution of resistance gene families will be conducted.
//
*Mission of the postdoctoral fel-
low*://The//production of raw reads will be
done before the postdoc arrival. The hired postdoc
with a strong background in bioinformatics or genome
analysis will make a survey of the best methods to ana-
lyze structural variations in rose genomes. He/she//willthen be in charge of the computer bio-analyses to
research the structural variants and to study gene
family evolution.
*Expected skills: *The desired applicant is expected to
be a bioinformatician or a bioanalyst with an expertise
in genome assembly and genetics. Expertise in the detec-
tion of genomic rearrangements, identication of homol-
ogous relations within gene family and/or gene family
evolution study would be appreciated. Programming
skills for one or several languages are needed. Social
skills are also important for the success of interactions.
Applications should be sent by email to

A 3-year NERC-funded postdoctoral position in plant
ecological genetics and evolutionary rescue available
at the University of Bristol, UK We are looking for
an enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher for a NERC
project on \evolutionary rescue and the limits of pheno-
typic plasticity", beginning in April 2017. This project
will transplant ecologically divergent but closely related
Senecio ragwort species on the slopes of Mount Etna,
Sicily.
This project is a new collaboration between the Univer-
sities of Bristol, Oxford, Napoli (Italy), Catania (Sicily)
and CNRS Montpellier.
It will combine extensive eld transplant experiments

ing or hindering evolutionary responses at ecological
margins.
The successful candidate will be based in Sicily for the
rst 15 months of the project, and then at the University
of Bristol. A major part of the research will involve the
extensive propagation and transplant of large numbers
of Senecio seedlings along an elevational gradient, moni-
toring their tness, and quantifying variation in their
traits and phenotypes. This will be followed by exten-130 EvolDir January 1, 2017
sive ecological and quantitative genetic analysis, and
transcriptomic analysis of the genomic basis of adaptive

UChicago ComplexDiseaseModels
Our lab at the University of Chicago has an immediate
opening for an NIH-funded postdoc to contribute to
a study of complex disease models of misfolded stress
response and of diabetes in the y. This work is aJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 133
continuing collaboration between Martin Kreitman (De-
partment of Ecology & Evolution), Graeme Bell (De-
partment of Medicine) and Matthew Stephens (Human
Genetics/Statistics). We are now at the stage of re-
search where we are collecting large amounts of NGS
data (DNA and RNA-Seq) from synthetic cage popula-
tions for a variety of traits. We are looking for someone
with background and experience analyzing large complex
datasets to identify genetic modiers of disease.
Contact martinkreitman@gmail.com if interested.
Project Summary: Drosophila, can be genetically ma-
nipulated to recapitulate human diseases. We have
constructed a complex disease model of misfolded pro-
teins by expressing a mutant diabetes-causing human
proinsulin protein (INSC96Y) in the Drosophila eye and
other tissues. The severity of proteostatic disease phe-
notypes in this model varies when the mutant transgene
is placed in dierent wild-derived genetic backgrounds
and this genetic variation can be mapped with high
resolution by genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
bulk segregant analysis of extreme phenotypes, and gene
expression studies. Here we propose innovative experi-
mental approaches to enhance the value of Drosophila
as a model for investigating naturally occurring genetic
variation inuencing the severity of proteostatic disease
or other complex traits. The research has four specic
aims: (1) Map genetic variation and expression QTL's
that modify cellular response to proteostatic challenge in
two developing tissues, the eye and notum. We have de-
veloped a novel application of bulk segregant analysis of
extreme phenotypes in an array of 16 synthetic y popu-
lations to enhance the signals from both common SNPs
and rare variants with eect sizes not detectable by con-
ventional GWAS; (2) Screen the synthetic populations
to identify alleles that are suppressed by the inhibition
of apoptosis. The approach is a novel population ge-
nomic analog of a classical genetic suppressor screen;
and (3) Investigate the interaction between environmen-
tal and genetic inputs to the breakdown of proteostasis;
(4) Explore genetic modiers of diabetes-like symptoms
in the y induced by a high sugar diet.

Postdoc positions in molecular phylogenomics, host-

The Simon lab at the University of Connecticut seeks cre-

in phylogenetics, molecular phylogenomics, bioinformat-

and/or microbiomes) to begin in the summer or fall of
2017. Experience in the preceding subjects preferred
but not required.
Applicants will participate in an NSF sponsored project
entitled: Exploring Symbiont Biodiversity and Com-
plexity in the Family Cicadidae. The major goal of this
proposal is to study the co-diversication and interac-
tion between cicadas, their primary \obligate" endosym-
bionts, their secondary \facultative" endosymbionts and
their gut microbiota. Cicada obligate endosymbionts
have recently been demonstrated to exhibit spectacu-
lar and unprecedented genome diversity. Since cicada
symbionts are largely unknown our work will result in
considerable biodiversity discovery. We hypothesize that
gain or loss of host-symbiont consortium members dur-
ing cicada phylogenetic history will be correlated with
internal or external environmental changes. We are
most interested in the timing of symbiont consortium
changes. For example, does the gain of a secondary
(facultative) endosymbiont facilitate the breakdown or
loss of primary (obligate) endosymbionts? Or does the
breakdown or loss of the obligate endosymbiont allow
invasion by a secondary endosymbiont? Similarly, we
ask whether the changes in the gut microbiota aect
primary endosymbionts (keeping in mind that gut mi-
crobiota are known to synthesize essential amino acids
for some hosts). Other hypotheses concern changes in
symbiont consortium membership related to changes in
the biotic or abiotic external environment coincident
with the invasion of new biogeographic areas charac-
terized by dierent climates and host plants. Broader
impacts will involve teaching collaborations with team
members in the US, Brazil, China, India, NZ, and Fiji.
Field trips to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Fiji, and India
are planned.

Postdoc: 3 postdoc positions in diversication, host-
parasite interactions, and rapid evolution of seasonal
phenology
Animals and plants must synchronize their life-history
timing to exploit good times and avoid bad times of the
year. Synchronization among interacting species makes
seasonal responses a critical organizational component
of ecological communities. Adaptation in seasonal tim-
ing can create and maintain biodiversity. Reproduction
is often seasonal. Therefore, shifts in seasonal timing
can disrupt reproductive timing among populations, cat-
alyzing speciation. Moreover, formation of new taxa
creates opportunities for other, interacting organisms
to diversify in kind. Shifts in seasonal timing can have
reverberating eects generating new biodiversity \se-
quentially" through ecosystems. Contemporary climate
change is driving changes in seasonality. The capacity of
ecological communities to evolve in concert with chang-
ing conditions will impact whether interactions among
community members will be maintained or disrupted
under new climatic regimes.
Our research team, including Je Feder at Notre Dame,
Greg Ragland at University of Colorado-Denver, Tom
Powell at Binghamton University New York, and Dan
Hahn at University of Florida will investigate the role
of seasonal adaptation in the origin and maintenance
of insect biodiversity. Rhagoletis pomonella, the apple
maggot y, is a fruit-feeding agricultural pest that has
recently evolved (since the mid 1880's). Seasonality
drives diversication; apple ies evolved an earlier life
cycle than their hawthorn-feeing ancestors to feed on
earlier ripening apple fruits. Superimposed on seasonal
partitioning of plant-feeding ies are additional \sequen-
tial" radiations involving parasitic wasps. Three wasps
have similarly diverged in life cycle timing to match
the seasonal shift of their R. pomonella hosts to earlier
fruiting apples.
This multidisciplinary project will test whether the same
physiological, molecular, and genomic mechanisms un-
derlying the shift in life history timing allowing Rhago-
letis to attack apples are also involved in sequential
shifts and seasonal adaptation of the parasitic wasps
attacking apple ies. This project will also manipulate
environmental conditions to assess the potential for cli-
mate change to disrupt the y and wasp communityJanuary 1, 2017 EvolDir 135
or if sucient genetic diversity exists in populations of
these insects for them to rapidly respond and co-evolve.
One postdoc each will join:
Greg Ragland's lab at University of Colorado-Denver

AvianEvolutionSpeciation
The Winger lab in the Department of Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology and the Museum of Zoology at the
University of Michigan is accepting applications for a
postdoctoral scientist position in avian evolutionary ge-
nomics and speciation. We conduct research on diverse
topics related to avian evolution and evolutionary ecol-
ogy, including speciation, the evolution of geographic
range, the assembly of regional biotas, and avian move-
ment ecology (seasonal migration and dispersal). We are
particularly interested in topics that bridge one or more
of these themes. The primary focus of this postdoctoral
position is to test the historical and ecological factors
that regulate speciation in Neotropical montane birds.
Specically, the project seeks to develop a comparative
genomic framework to test how ecological and social
selection pressures interact with population history to
inuence trajectories of speciation in the Andes. Du-
ties may involve development of genomic libraries and
sample preparation in a molecular lab, assembly and
analysis of genomic data, project organization, training
of graduate and undergraduate students, and collabora-
tive grant and manuscript writing. \Wet lab" molecular
work will take place in a highly collaborative, multi-PI,
biodiversity-focused genomic laboratory in the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Depending
on expertise, the postdoc may also contribute to other
research endeavors in the Winger lab that involve ge-
nomic, phylogenetic, distributional or morphological
(specimen-based) datasets.
A successful applicant would have a PhD in evolutionary
biology, evolutionary or ecological genomics, population
genetics, phylogenetics or biodiversity informatics by
summer, 2017; demonstrated success in publication and
grant writing of original research; a passion for bio-
diversity and natural history of birds or other taxa;
and a track record of and interest in mentorship of un-
dergraduate students. Ideally, a successful applicant
would also have expertise in at least one of the follow-
ing areas: genomic and bioinformatic methods such
as whole genome sequencing and assembly, sequence
capture and/or short-read sequencing and assembly;
population genetic and/or phylogenetic analytical meth-
ods, particularly as pertains to genomic data; and/or
uency in scripting languages such as Python or R. This
Postdoctoral Fellowship is intended to be a two-yearposition, pending a successful performance review after
the rst year. Desired start date is September 1, 2017,
but may be negotiable. Applicants should send a letter
of interest, CV, and list of three references to Dr. Ben
Winger (wingerb@umich.edu) by December 9th, 2016.

Postdoctoral Fellow in Evolutionary Biology-1602140
Applications are invited for this full-time, xed-term
position of Postdoctoral Fellow in Evolutionary Biology
within the Department of Zoology at the University of
Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. This position in the
laboratory of Professor Hamish G. Spencer is funded by
the Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand
and is available for three years.
The project is entitled \Epigenetics and Evolutionary
Theory." Just as natural populations exhibit genetic
variation, so too do they harbour epigenetic variation,
some of which is transmitted from one generation to the
next. This project asks how we can explain this trans-
generationally inherited epigenetic variation in natural
populations and what might be the consequences for
evolution. The researchers will construct and analyse
novel mathematical models to investigate these matters,
validating these models with data from real examples,
and using the models to make novel predictions about
the properties of epigenetic variation in nature.
You will have a strong interest in applying quantita-
tive methods in biology. In addition, you will demon-
strate a good record of publication in peer-reviewed
journals, together with high quality oral and written
communication skills. Previous experience in modelling
population-genetic theory is desirable but not essential.
Our research group and the wider Department includes
world-class research sta, facilities and strong interna-
tional collaborations, oering you excellent opportuni-
ties to gain a variety of highly pertinent research and
technical skills.

Postdoctoral fellowship South Africa.
Success in an unpredictable habitat: geographic unpre-
dictability and social exibility146 EvolDir January 1, 2017
(University of the Witwatersrand, South Arica; Succu-
lent Karoo Research Station; CNRS Strasbourg, France)
A 24 month postdoc position is available in the
elds of Behavioral Ecology and Eco-Physiology in the
Striped Mouse Research Group www.stripedmouse.com
of Dr Neville Pillay https://www.wits.ac.za/apes and
Dr Carsten Schradin http://www.iphc.cnrs.fr/-Carsten-
Schradin-.html. The postdoc will be employed by the
University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, collect
data in the Succulent Karoo Research Station and possi-
bly do laboratory work at the Institut Pluridisciplinaire
Hubert Curien, Departement d'Ecologie Physiologie et
Ethologie (DEPE), France's largest eco-physiology lab-
oratory.
Research topic. The striped mouse is well known for its
social exibility: it can live either in groups or solitarily.
Previous long-term studies over 8 years revealed that the
lower the population density, the more striped mice live
solitarily. Now we want to test whether social exibility,
which is adaptive due to environmental variation over
time, is also an adaptation to geographic variation.
In the Succulent Karoo, striped mice live in relatively
small demes of several hundred to a few thousand indi-
viduals along dry riverbeds. These demes are isolated
from each other via habitat that is uninhabitable for
striped mice due to the lack of cover and food. Using ge-
netic markers, we found that striped mice disperse over
these unoccupied habitats to nd other striped mouse
demes several km away, travelling through hostile envi-
ronments. However, they are unaware of the prevailing
conditions in these dierent habitats. We know that it
is mainly striped mice of below average body mass that
disperse over these areas, possibly making the best of a
bad job.
The postdoc will study 8 demes of striped mice (Rhab-
domys pumilio) within the Goegap Nature Reserve in
the Succulent Karoo of South Africa simultaneously
during one breeding season, with the help of 8 research
assistants. We expect to nd signicant dierences be-
tween demes in 1) mean body mass of adult breeders; 2)
population density; and 3) social organisation, especially
the ratio of solitary vs. group-living individuals. The
main eld site is well established, and the population
has been permanently monitored by a team at the re-
search station for over a decade. Striped mice will be
trapped, marked, and observed, and blood samples will
be collected for hormone analyzes in Strasbourg.
Objectives
1. Relate geographic variation in population density to
social exibility.
2. Study the adaptive value of male dispersal.3. Study the endocrine modulators of emigration and
social exibility, with a focus on testosterone and corti-
costerone levels.
4. Analyse and publish long-term data in the rst year
Salary: This position is funded by the University of the
Witwatersrand with a very competitive salary of R 198
432/ year, which allows for a comfortable standard of
living in South Africa. In addition, medical aid is paid
by the University as well as relocation costs of R10 000.
Starting date: July to November 2017 (variable).
Time schedule: The postdoc will rst help with data
collection in Goegap to become familiar with all eld
techniques. Up until April 2018, she/he will analy-
size and publish existing long-term data. The topic of
this long term data will be discussed, but could be un-
derstanding the evolutionary, ecological and endocrine
reasons for the occurrence of bachelor (all male) groups
during some breeding seasons, or a project on socio-
genetics, using a 8 years pedigree database. From May
2018 onwards, the dierent eld sites will be prepared
and research technicians trained. Main data collection
will be from 1st July to 15th October 2018. Afterwards,
data will be analysed and published.
Prole and requirements for the candidate:
- Must have obtained your PhD within the last 5 years
- Enthusiastic about eld work with the willingness to
spend 9 months /year in the eld.
- Good organizational skills and the ability to work
independently.
- Good personal skills and ability to lead a research team
- You can produce outstanding academic results!
- Strong background in eco-physiology and/or behavioral
ecology.
- Very good writing skills proven by a good publication
record.
- Good technical skills.
- Strong experimental, analytical and statistical skills.
Applicants should send a cover letter detailing their mo-
tivation and expectations of this position, a CV, and con-
tact information of at least two referees combined into a
single PDF to Neville Pillay (Neville.Pillay@wits.ac.za)

Berlin ScienticWriting Mar28-29 2
Dear all,
we still have a few places available on our \Scientic
Writing: organization and motivation booster" Work-
shop, 28-29 March 2017 in Berlin Germany
http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course7/ In-
structor: Dr. Andrea Sanchini (Robert Koch Institut,
Berlin)
Overview
Scientic writing is hard. Young students have dicul-
ties in writing their articles or theses and at the same
time carrying out their research projects. Supervisors
and Professors have diculties to train younger scien-
tists in scientic writing. In addition, the standards for
the publication of research articles and other scientic
documents are increasing. This course is intended to be
very pragmatic: we will develop a set of how-to infor-
mation for writing research articles and for increasing
writing productivity. The aim of this course is to give to
participants the knowledge and the tools to change and
improve their routine writing activities. At the end of
the course the participants will became more organized
and motivated in scientic writing.
Teaching format
The instructor provides lectures and tips from own writ-
ing experience. Participants will do writing exercises in-
dividually and in groups in order to apply the knowledge
acquired during the lectures. The instructor provides
also practical examples on how to use software useful for
scientic writing. There will be enough time to share
feedback and challenges in group discussions.
Preparing for the courseDuring the course, participants can draft part of their
next writing project (one to two pages). This project
can be a research article or a thesis.
Therefore participants are asked to decide in advance
which writing task they want to do during the course.
Intended audience
The course is especially useful for PhD candidates of
Natural, Life and Social Sciences faculties at any stage
of their PhD. The course is also useful for young stu-
dents such as Bachelor and Master Students of the same
faculties in order to make them already familiar with
the process of scientic writing. More experienced sci-
entists and researchers can also take advantage of the
course, since they can improve their writing skills and
productivity.
Course Program
1st Day
Session 1: Challenges in scientic writing
In the rst session of the course participants will get fa-
miliar with the basic principles of scientic writing. The
instructor will show the common challenges and typical
blocks regarding scientic writing. The instructor will
also show misconceptions about scientic writing and
wrong habits that lead to write slowly and to produce
poor texts. The participants will then learn about the
dierent stages of the writing process, and how to eec-
tively organize their writing projects. At the end of the
session participants will also explore the most common
causes of unclear scientic writing.
Session 2: Structure of a research article
Here the instructor presents the main sections of a re-
search articles: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discus-
sion, References and Abstract. Particular importance
will be given to the paragraph structure, which can be
used as basic writing unit of a research article. The
instructor will also present how to manage the ow of
information in scientic writing.
2nd Day
Session 3: Figures and Tables
In this session the instructor will explain how to eec-
tively present the scientic information in gures and
tables in a clear and unambiguous way. In addition,
information on how to write gure and table legends
will also be provided.
Session 4: Writing productivity
Here the instructor shows the dierent types of writ-
ers and their respective advantages and disadvantages
for scientic writing. The instructor will show several150 EvolDir January 1, 2017
techniques, software and motivational tools to increase
the writing productivity and remove writers' blocks.
The aim is to show that writing productivity is a skill
that can be learned and mastered with discipline and
commitment.
Session 5: Self- and team-management of the writing
process
In the last session the instructor will focus on the man-
agement part of scientic writing. Specically the team
work among co-authors and supervisors, how to organize
the time eectively in order to reach the writing goals,
how to plan the writing projects and how to increase
eciency through self-assessment.
Further information:
The cost is 350 euros (VAT included) including refresh-
ments and course material. We also oer an all-inclusive
package at 460 euros (VAT included), including course
material, refreshments, accomodation and meals (break-
fast, lunch, dinner).

Overview:
Title: Genomics of Disease in Wildlife: A Workshop
Location: Lory Conference Student Center, ColoradoState University, Fort Collins, CO
Dates: June 3-11, 2017
Website: www.gdw2017workshop.colostate.edu Appli-
cation deadline: February 1, 2017.
Wildlife biodiversity can be drastically aected by the
outbreak and transmission of disease pathogens in both
natural habitats and ex situ populations. Recent tech-
nological advances in genomic sciences and increasingly
aordable Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay
costs have coalesced to result in powerful tools to moni-
tor, detect, and reconstruct the past, present and future
role of pathogens within wildlife biodiversity. This short
course will provide hands-on training for graduate level
and above researchers in wildlife disease related disci-
plines seeking to incorporate genomic data into their
projects. The course will be taught by a core group of
experts in genome data analyses with invited faculty
comprised of pre-eminent scientists performing cutting
edge of research in host-pathogen genomics in wildlife.
Why is the course needed?
Advances in genomic technology now provide an ex-
traordinary opportunity to rapidly assess the impact of
disease in wildlife biodiversity, management, and con-
servation. Wildlife researchers are uniquely positioned
to merge ecological, biological, and evolutionary studies
with genomic technologies to generate unprecedented
Big Data tools in disease research. The workshop will
provide a venue to accomplish this goal, will provide
networking opportunities for colleagues from intersect-
ing interests, and will advance genomic tools in wildlife
disease investigations.
How will the course address the need?
The course will provide essential training to wildlife
biologists, veterinarians, conservation managers, and
related experts to successfully incorporate NGS data
in wildlife research. Attendees will conduct hands-on
analyses of real world genomic data of both host and
pathogen. The course will provide: (1) an overview of
current bioinformatics developments and approaches;
(2) guidance to implement genomic tools in study de-
sign; (3) NGS data analysis and interpretation; and, (4)
opportunities for interaction with peers, core faculty,
and invited experts.
Workshop Syllabus
The workshop will cover a typical workow com-
monly used in NGS analyses starting with the initial
raw sequence through the nal stages of identifying
host:pathogen variants linked with disease. Each of
the eight days of the workshop will cover an essential
component of the NGS workow in succession.January 1, 2017 EvolDir 151
Morning sessions will be a series of instructional lec-
tures and demonstrations that will concisely present
the purpose, justication and implementation of the
specic workow unit. Short and exciting ash talks
presented by CSU faculty will present some of their on-
going investigations using genomic tools in wildlife dis-
ease. The afternoon sessions will be computer-intensive
labs in which attendees will perform hands-on analyses
with real-world genomic data for each workow topic.
Evening plenary lectures from invited faculty will con-
clude each days activities.
Teaching tools will include exercises using real-world
NGS data from a range of pathogens and host species.
Participants will learn the importance of integrating
NGS data from both host and pathogen in order to
better understand current epidemics in wildlife.
For the duration of the course, each attendee will be
provided with a MacBook Pro computer and peripheral
equipment, and prepared genome datasets from several
host species and associated pathogens. These datasets
will be organized into various les and formats prior
to the course, demonstrate key concepts, and be the
foundation for computer exercises and teaching tools.
Summary of Workshop Schedule
Day 1: Arrival, Registration and Opening Reception.
The workshop begins in the evening of Sunday June 3,
2017 at the Lory Conference Center. A welcome session
will introduce faculty and an overview of the workshop.
An informal welcome reception follows with faculty, sta
and participants.
Day 2: Optimizing NGS data and study design. Lec-
tures and computer labs will introduce the dierent
types of NGS data and how to best use these data in
the study of disease in wildlife. Topics will include the
latest advances in NGS technologies, NGS denitions,
examples, applications, and experimental design. Com-
puter lab will introduce host and pathogen datasets for
the workshop, methods in genome mining, and navigat-
ing genome browsers.

Erasmus Mundus Master Program in Evolutionary Bi-
ology (MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master program
for talented and motivated students who are interested
in understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four Euro-
pean universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands;
University of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,
Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA). Together, this consortium has put together an
attractive multidisciplinary program that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at (at least)
two partner universities, and they will receive a double
degree from two partner universities they have attended.
Being nanced by the European Community, MEME
has to satisfy the high quality standards imposed the
prestigious Erasmus+ Program. A limited number of full
scholarships is available for European and non-European
students and these will be awarded in a selective pro-
cedure. Details on the program and the selection pro-
cedure can be found on www.evobio.eu . Starting date:

This is a reminder for our workshop on zoonotic diseases,
host-parasite coevolution and ancient DNA (aDNA).
*Deadline is Dec 21 !!*
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and
the Robert Koch Institute are organizing the workshop
*One Past Health*
- Understanding past zoonotic events to predict future
ones -
from February 15th to 17th, 2017, at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen/Germany.
http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/OnePastHealth This work-
shop aims to foster the interdisciplinary dialog between
medical, veterinary and biological sciences, bringing to-
gether empirical and theoretical researchers interested
in disease ecology, epidemiology, host-pathogen coevolu-
tion, paleogenomics, and more. The resulting interac-
tions will promote interdisciplinary scientic progress
and may ultimately help uncovering ways to prevent
future zoonotic events.
Synopsis: Many infectious diseases that are of high154 EvolDir January 1, 2017
public health relevance today nd their roots in past
zoonotic events, e.g. the HIV-1 pandemics. Similarly,
for these infectious diseases involving recurrent transmis-
sion from zoonotic reservoirs, most transmission events
lie in the past, e.g. the historical pandemics of Yersinia
pestis. These past events are an immense, precious
and underexplored record of the processes leading to
zoonotic emergence.
We have some tools to indirectly frame the context of
zoonotic events. Historical outbreak records are such a
tool but unfortunately often reveal a very unclear source
of information. Over the last 2 decades, we took advan-
tage of major advances in molecular biology, statistics
and computational sciences to leverage the power of a
natural record of the evolutionary history: the genetic di-
versity of present-day pathogens. This information was
used to determine the origin in time and space as well
as the later spread of Ebola viruses or HIV-1. But what
if we could travel back in time and observe what really
happened? We could then directly test the hypotheses
we derive from present-day genetic diversity and catch
evolution red-handed at crucial steps of the emergence
process. Ancient DNA (aDNA) approaches are now
ripe to simultaneously investigate the evolution of many
pathogens (including zoonotic ones) and the evolution of
the immune system of their hosts. This maturity nicely
coincides with the development of modeling frameworks
that allow us to make the most of heterochronous data
and to describe individual pathogen trajectories in the
context of the microbial communities they belong to.

Course description Study methods in population ge-
nomics have been profoundly reshaped in the last few
years thanks to the growing availability of complete
genomic sequences at population level. The rapid and
recent growth of data and methods calls for new ap-
proaches to become routine in evolutionary genomics lab-
oratories. The objective of this EMBO Practical Course
is to give an overview of state of the art methods in pop-
ulation genomics combining lecturing from outstanding
experienced population geneticists and software devel-
opers. All conceptual innovation will be presented in
lectures and applied in practice both individually and
in group work. Practicals includes computer exercises
supervised by lecturers and training assistants. After
attending the course participants will be aware of up-to-
date concepts in population genetics, capable of running
analyses using software based on whole genome data
sequences and able to deal with basic aspects of any
population genomics project. This EMBO Practical
Course aims at evolutionary biologists who already have
bioinformatics skills. PhD students and Post-Doc re-
searchers will benet the most out of this course, but
applications from all candidates will be evaluated in
their context.

netics organized by Octavio Paulo jJanuary 30 -February
3 2017 @ Lisbon, Portugal
Objectives: Phylogenetics is one of the scientic areas
of Biology that has grown fast and evolved in method-
ological terms in the last years. Its applications go from
the studies of the evolution of species and populations
to the least expected, as the study of the origin of the
AIDS virus or seasonal cycles of the u. The course is
aimed at students and professionals that intend to get
started in phylogenetic analysis as well as researchers
already with some experience wanting to deepen or up-
date their knowledge in the eld. The course consists of
theoretical classes as well as hands-on practical sessions
using software. Participants are encouraged to bring
their own sequence data for analysis.

Evolutionary Biology Workshop in the Alps
(The previous posting contained a typo in an invited
professor's name, for which we apologize.)
The 2017 edition of the Evolutionary Biology Work-
shop in the Alps will take place on 17-23 June 2017 in
Riederfurka, Switzerland.
Target participants are PhD students in early stages of
PhD and advanced Master students.
The main goals of this annual workshop, based on a con-
cept developed by Stephen Stearns and John Maynard
Smith, are to develop the following skills: - developing
your scientic ideas through discussions in groups; -
thinking critically and expressing oneself clearly; - turn-
ing a general idea into a research project; - writing a
research proposal and defending it.
Faculty: Lynda Delph (Indiana University) Curt Lively
(Indiana University) Noah Whiteman (University of Cal-
ifornia Berkeley) Sergio Rasmann (University of Neucha-
tel) Tadeusz Kawecki (University of Lausanne)
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a re-
search project that will address it. The faculty will visit
the groups during the discussions to answer questions,January 1, 2017 EvolDir 157
provide coaching and give feedback on the projects, but
they will generally take the back seat. Additionally,
the faculty will give informal talks about their research
and be available for informal discussions with individual
students. At the end you will present your projects to
other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in Villa Cassel (http://-
www.pronatura-aletsch.ch/home-en), at 2000 m of alti-
tude, in a 110 year old villa where Winston Churchill
once stayed, amid the magnicent mountain landscape
of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a walking dis-
tance from the largest glacier of the Alps. This isolated
site will help you to concentrate on the course while
giving you also the chance to enjoy the views and the
alpine ora.
Fee: CHF 490.-
Participants will receive a course certicate for 3 ETCS
credits.
To apply, send a single le (pdf or rtf) containing a
short motivation letter including a brief summary of
your research interest, a cv, and the name of your scien-
tic advisor to Caroline Betto-Colliard <Caroline.Betto-
Colliard@unil.ch >, with Cc to tadeusz.kawecki@unil.ch
. Please put \Evolutionary workshop" in the subject.

Instructions158 EvolDir January 1, 2017
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
