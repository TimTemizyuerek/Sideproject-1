Dear biodiversity enthusiasts,
We are pleased to invite you to the Senckenberg Biodi-
versity Genomics Symposium on 21. April 2021.
This one-day virtual event is co-organised by the
LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics
(tbg.senckenberg.de/) at the Senckenberg Research In-
stitute, and PacBio. Scientists from Europe and else-
where will share their experiences in using PacBio long-
read sequencing techniques to generate reference-quality
genomes of taxonomically diverse organisms to address
key questions in ecology and evolution.
The event includes: - Presentations with a focus on
biodiversity - Live Q&A sessions - Poster presentations
- On-demand tutorials for those new to PacBio
We have a great list of conrmed speakers, presenting ge-
nomic insights from a broad range of eukaryotic species.4 EvolDir April 1, 2021

Online CIGENE Mar17
Dear EvolDir members,
We are pleased to announce the coming talk at the on-
line CIGENE seminar by Anneliese Mason (University
of Bonn) on 17th March 2021 at 12:00-12:50 (Oslo time).
He will talk about: \Making new crop species".
Abstract: By investigating how hybrid species form, we
hope to work out how to utilise these natural evolution-
ary processes for human agricultural benet, making
new Brassica crop types for food, oil and biofuel. Hy-
bridisation and genome doubling are processes which
often result in increased vigour and ability to exploit dif-
ferent environmental niches in nature. Hence, if we can
harness these processes to produce new hybrid species,
such species may have a wider tolerance of environmen-
tal conditions such as heat, drought and disease, which
would be benecial to human agriculture.

Dear EvolDir members,
We are pleased to announce the coming talk at the
online CIGENE seminar by Kentaro Shimizu (Univer-
sity of Zurich) on 24th March 2021 at 12:00-12:50 (Oslo
time). He will talk about: \Genome duplication aected
patterns of selection in polyploid Arabidopsis and wheat
species".
Abstract: In 1970, Susumu Ohno proposed that genome
duplication is an important source of novelty in verte-
brates. Recent advances in polyploid genomics enabled
population genomic studies of initial stages of genome
duplication. Our data supported that parental adap-
tive traits were combined thanks to allopolyploidization
in natural Arabidopsis and crop wheat allopolyploid
species.

I'm pleased to let you all know that registration and
abstract submission are now open for the Interna-
tional Society for Evolutionary Medicine and public
health (ISEMPH) annual meeting: https://isemph.org/-
ISEMPH-2021 Given that the conference will be online,
and the rates are very reasonable (especially for mem-
bers and students), now is the ideal time to try out an
ISEMPH meeting, if you've never attended one.
If you register to join us, I would also particularly
encourage you to consider taking part in the Evolu-
tionary Medicine and Public Health Grand Challenges
<https://isemph.org/Grand-Challenges-2021 >. The
Grand Challenges events will oer an excellent network-
ing opportunity, and will make the conference feel much
more interactive than an online conference would usually
be.

Online SexAsexuality Jun16-17
Dear all!
With this email we would like to announce an ESEB
online satellite meeting on \Genomic signatures and
consequences of sex and asexuality" to be held on the
16th and 17th of June 2021, 13:00 to 17:00 CET (each
day). We are delighted to already have been able to
recruit two excellent keynote speakers and will send out
a general invitation for registration and abstract sub-
mission in the coming weeks. In the meantime, please
see the abstract below and save the date!
Abstract: Sex, including outcrossing with meiosis, is by
far the most common form of reproduction in eukaryotes.
However, under similar ecological and genetic conditions,
an individual undergoing asexual reproduction without
outcrossing, will generate more ospring (each of which
is itself capable of generating ospring) than a sexual
sibling. It is thought that this cost of sex is oset by the
benets conferred by the exchange of genetic material,thus avoiding mutational meltdown (Muller's ratchet)
and genomic decay.
Sexual reproduction is realised in an impressive array
of dierent strategies. Still, asexual species are found
on terminal branches in many unrelated clades through-
out the eukaryotic tree of life. The availability of high
quality phased genomes only now allows us, to study
the genomic underpinnings of transitions in reproduc-
tive modes, to compare the long-term eects of sex and
asexuality on genomes, and to analyse the functional
mechanisms of the loss and even regain of sex.
In this two half-days symposium we will invite speakers
working on genomic aspects of sex and asexuality in
organisms across the eukaryotic tree of life and invite
talks on - genomics and genomic models of the drivers
of loss of sex/gain of sex - analyses of the consequences
of loss of sex on the genomic level - genomic changes
accompanying transitions in reproductive systems such
as from unisexual or hermaphroditic to separate sexes,
or from environmental sex determination to genetic sex
determination.
We are looking forward to your participation and great
talks and discussions.
All the very best,
Astrid Bohne and Philipp Schier

PorquerollesIsland France MCEB
Jun13-17
Dear all,
The 2021 edition of the MCEB conference will take place
on June 13-17 in Porquerolles, France:
https://mceb2021.sciencesconf.org/ We are aiming at
having a \regular" conference, with all participants
spending a week on the island. Yet, current restrictions
limit the number of attendees to 60. Other restrictions
(e.g., wearing masks, keeping physical distances between
two persons to at least one meter, etc.) will likely apply
too.
Submissions of posters and/or talks will open the 24th
of March and close the 9th of April. Notication of
acceptance or rejection will be sent by the 26th of April.Registration to the conference will open the following
day (the 27th of April). Registration fees (about 500 eu-
ros, refundable in case of cancellation of the event) will
cover accommodation plus breakfast, diner and supper.
The main focus of this year's edition will be on \Climate
Changes and their Impacts on Evolution", in particu-
lar the preservation of biodiversity, the conservation of
species, the study of ecosystems and their dynamics,
and the reconstruction of major past changes of climate
and living conditions on Earth.
We will also welcome contributions dealing with math-
ematical and computational techniques that improved
our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
design and application of integrative approaches that
incorporate genetic data along with other sources of
information (e.g., geography) in order to decipher the
processes governing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, will
be of particular interest.
The list of invited speakers for this year's edition is
given below:
- Bastien Boussau (Laboratoire de Biom etrie et Biologie
Evolutive,CNRS, Lyon, FR) - Lounes Chikhi (Insti-
tuto Gulbenkian, Lisboa and CNRS, Toulouse, FR) -
Christophe Dessimoz (University of Lausanne, CH) - Si-
mon Gravel (Mc Gill University, Montreal, CA) - Emma
Hodcroft (ISPM, University of Bern in Switzerland) -
Michel Milinkovitch (Universit e de Gen eve, CH) - Tandy
Warnow (University of Illinois , USA)

Department of Quantitative Genetics and Genomics
(QGG) PhD programme. The position is available from
1 August 2021 or later.Title: Method development in human statistical genetics
Research area and project description: The PhD will
be supervised by Professor Doug Speed, and based at
the Department of Quantitative Genetics and Genomics
(QGG) at Aarhus University. Dr. Speed's research
involves developing methods for better analysing data
from genome-wide association studies, with a partic-
ular focus on improving our understanding of human
complex traits (e.g., physical traits such as height and
BMI, or common diseases such as schizophrenia and
epilepsy). Dr. Speed has developed the software LDAK
(www.ldak.org).
The aim of the PhD is to develop new methods with
the following goals: to identify causal loci (i.e., nd
genetic variant that inuence phenotypes); to construct
prediction models (be able to predict an individuals
phenotypes from their genetic information); or to un-
derstand genetic architecture (investigate the biological
mechanisms underlying complex traits). These meth-
ods will then be applied to large-scale datasets (e.g.,
100,000s of individuals from UK Biobank). Please see

A Margaret Woolo funded PhD opportunity is avail-
able in the group of Dr Niall McKeown at Aberystwyth
University. The project title is \Understanding African
marine forests and developing sustainable livelihoods
for coastal communities". This exciting and impact-
ful research has been developed in collaboration with
the University of Namibia and there is considerable
exibility in project direction.
Project Description: Kelp are large multicellular al-
gae which often form extensive marine forests. These
forests are among the most productive habitats on earth
and shape diverse ecosystems that support socioeco-
nomically important industries. Over the last 50 years
climate change has driven substantial global declines
of kelp. Although the west coast of Africa represents a
climate change hotspot this region has been neglected
in kelp research to date. This knowledge gap may have
extreme negative environmental, social, and economic
consequences for the local communities that already ex-
perience disproportionate levels of poverty, drought, andabusive external appropriation of resources, culminating
in compromised food security and human health.
The proposed research has been developed with the
University of Namibia in response to these concerns. It
will combine genetics, ecology, and synthesis of local
knowledge to understand the diversity, productivity, and
resilience of marine forest ecosystem functioning and
services along the west coast of Africa. This will inform
prediction of responses to climate change and contin-
gency planning for existing kelp dependent industries
(e.g. subsistence sheries). It will also aid develop-
ment of sustainable kelp harvesting and aquaculture
activities which represent untapped livelihood/income
opportunities for the local communities.
The research also comprises exploratory bioprocessing
of alginates focused on identifying compounds with
drought alleviation properties. Broadly, this multidis-
ciplinary project in collaboration with African based
partners aims to obtain and communicate a greater un-
derstanding of the region's marine forests and serve as
an engine to enable the local communities to fully utilise

AustralianNatlU VenomEvolution
The diversity of venomous animals fascinates us both
on a scientic and cultural level. \Is it venomous?" is
an age-old question humans and other animals had to
quickly answer to survive. Ecologically, venom is a game
changer. It enables the acquisition of novel food sources
and strikes fear into much larger potential predators.
Surprisingly, the steps taking animal salivary glands to
venom glands remain poorly understood. Recent work in
my lab has shown that (a) reptilian and mammalian ven-
oms evolved from the ancestral salivary gene regulatory
network, and furthermore (b) key toxins evolved from
homologous ancestral genes that underwent sequence
and copy number changes in venomous organisms. I
am looking for a Ph.D. student who will build on this
work. The overall goal will be to examine whether the
evolution of venom has modied the ancestral salivary
gene regulatory network to accommodate the increased
demand for protein synthesis and folding.
The rst aim will be to take a comparative approach
to test the hypothesis that parallel origins of venom led
to parallel changes in gene regulatory networks. Venom
glands originated as salivary glands, which have con-
served gene regulatory networks, representing a consis-
tent set of initial conditions for subsequent evolution.
Remarkably, despite the sophistication of some venom
glands, such as those of advanced snakes, much of the
regulatory architecture has been preserved, albeit with
some modications, such as gene duplications in certain
core members. We will use repeated origins in reptiles
(lizards and snakes) and mammals (short-tailed and
water shrews). This is an ideal system to address a
key knowledge gap in evolutionary biology 'V how generegulatory networks evolve alongside phenotypes 'V be-
cause venom evolved at least twice in each group. At
the same time, at a genetic level, venom is a simple phe-
notype consisting of a relatively small number of toxin
genes, making their interactions with the rest of the
network possible to trace. Characterising the extent of
parallelism will reveal the role gene regulatory networks
play in trait evolution, as well as deeper mechanistic
insights into how phenotypic novelty arises.
This will be a fully funded Ph.D. student position at
the Australian National University. Applicants are ex-
pected to have at least one rst-author publication, or
something equivalent like a masters thesis.
Having traveled all over the world, I will vouch for the
fact that Canberra is a fantastic place to live in terms of
quality of life and climate. Furthermore, the Research
School of Biology, and particularly the Division of Ecol-
ogy and Evolution, oers dynamic and intellectually
stimulating environments, particularly for early career
researchers.

Barcelona PredictingEvolution
1.Basic job and project description:
The position is the Autonomous University of Barcelona
(UAB).
-The main project questions are:
Can we predict evolution? Or at least some aspects of
it?
How should gene networks and cell interactions be or-
ganized to lead to complex phenotypes?
How is such organization achieved in evolution?
How does gene network organization aect how the
phenotype evolves(e.g. evolvability)?
In our lab we think that there is a limited number of18 EvolDir April 1, 2021
ways in which gene and cell interactions can be orga-
nized to lead to robust and complex phenotypes. If
that is the case, we should be able to predict evolution?
Or at least some aspects of it under specic selection
pressures?
We will use computational models of the genotype-
phenotype map and computational models of evolution
by natural selection to study such questions for the
case of organismic complexity (e.g. anatomy). The
genotype-phenotype maps models we develop are based
on realistic gene network models of pattern formation
and morphogenesis that lead to realistic 3D multicellular
phenotypes.
The position is in Salazar-Ciudad's group and it entails
obtaining a PhD from the Autonomous University of
Barcelona (UAB).
2. Background of the project:
There is no consensus denition of complexity, yet it is
evident that organisms are complex and explaining such
complexity is one of the most fundamental questions of
biology. Morphological complexity has not increased in
the evolution of all lineages and, in general, it is unclear
whether there is a general trend of increasing complexity
in evolution. Yet, one may ask about the mechanisms
by which such complexity has increased in the lineages
where it has increased. How complexity increases dur-
ing evolution is necessarily related to development: any
evolutionary change in morphology is rst a change in
the development that produces such morphology.
It has been argued that, in spite of the remarkable mor-
phological complexity of organisms, their development is
achieved through a limited number of cell behaviors and
types of cell interactions. These cell behaviors would be
cell division, cell adhesion, cell death, cell growth, cell
contraction, extracellular signal and matrix secretion,
extracellular signal reception and cell dierentiation.
In addition to cell behaviors, development involves in-
teractions between cells, either mechanical or through
extracellular signalling.
The questions we want to approach in this study are:
how should these interactions and cell behaviors be co-
ordinated to produce complex and robust morphologies?
The question is, then, whether there are some logical
requirements that developmental mechanisms should
fulll in order to lead to complex robust morphologies.
Are there, for example, some requirements at the level
of gene network topology or at the level of cell behaviors
and their coordination during development?
If, as suggested above, pattern transformations in de-
velopment involve a limited set of cell behaviors and
cell interactions, then any mathematical model imple-menting those and intracellular gene networks should
be able to reproduce, to a large extent, the range of pat-
tern transformations possible in animal development. In
this project we will use one such model, EmbryoMaker
(Marin-Riera et al, 2015)^ a, to simulate a large number of
possible developmental mechanisms and try to discover
what, if anything, do the mechanisms leading to robust
complex morphologies have in common.
3. Job description
The main tasks of the student include using and mod-
ifying existing models of embryonic development (e.g.
EmbryoMaker) in order to simulate the development of
complex morphologies. These models will be combined
with models of evolution, in a population context with
mutation, genetic drift and natural selection on morphol-
ogy (see for example Salazar-Ciudad and Marin-Riera,
2013). he gene networks found to lead to the develop-
ment of complex and robust phenotypes in evolution
would be analyzed to extract general regularities, if any,
these gene networks need to fulll.
The main tasks, thus, consist in simulation, theorizing,
data analysis, coding, literature searching, writing and
presenting results in conferences. We seek candidates
highly motivated for theoretical work and data analysis
with a broad and deep understanding of the evolutionary
theory and/or developmental biology and/or modeling.
4. Requirements:
- Candidates should have a University Degree and a
Master's Degree in biology, or similar within the Euro-
pean Higher Education System (minimum 300 ECTS)
or equivalent by September 2019.
- Scientic programming skills or a willingness to acquire
them is required.
- The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.
5. Salary and conditions:
- The salary would be the standard one graduate stu-
dents in Spain.

BielefeldU BlackGrouseGenomics
Due to a limited response, we have extended the dead-
line for the following position until April 30th 2021. We
welcome applications for this exciting project!
PhD studentship: Genomics of sexual trait expression
in black grouse. With Prof Joe Homan (Bielefeld Uni-
versity, Germany), Dr Carl Soulsbury (University of
Lincoln, UK) and Prof Kees van Oers (Netherlands
Institute of Ecology and Wageningen University, the
Netherlands).
An outstanding opportunity is available for a PhD stu-
dent to work on the evolutionary genomics of sexual trait
expression in an iconic avian model system, the black
grouse (Lyrurus tetrix). The position is available in Joe
Homan' ^As research group (www.thehomanlab.com)
at the Department of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld
University and is fully funded for three years.
The PhD project Since Darwin rst coined the term
'^A ¥sexual selection' ^A to explain the evolution of exag-
gerated male traits, we have come to understand the
complex interrelationships among these traits, the infor-
mation they encode and the life histories of the animals
they are embedded into. Sexual selection is built on the
idea that individual quality is signalled by the expression
of these traits, yet a clear mechanistic understanding
of the genetic architectures of sexual traits and themechanisms regulating sexual trait expression remains
elusive.
We know that inbreeding is an important component of
individual quality, and several studies have documented
inbreeding depression for sexually-selected traits. More-
over, trait expression can be inuenced by dynamic
factors such as age and environmental variation, so epi-
genetic control mediated by body condition has been
proposed as a means of regulating genotype-dependent
sexual trait expression. Resolving long-standing evolu-
tionary questions about mate choice and sexual selection
therefore requires a fundamental understanding of the
genetic and epigenetic basis of sexual traits.
This project will combine the genomic inference of in-
breeding with genome-wide methylation analysis to in-
vestigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms aect-
ing sexual trait expression and reproductive success in
a classical lek model system, the black grouse. Genomic
estimates of inbreeding will be used to quantify the
impacts of consanguinity on multiple sexual traits and
to evaluate the ' ^A ¥genic capture' ^A hypothesis, which
argues that sexual traits are inuenced by the cumula-
tive eects of large numbers of loci distributed across
the genome. Finally, we will build upon a recent pilot
study linking heterozygosity to sexual trait expression
via dierential DNA methylation (Soulsbury et al. 2017)
by using a genome-wide methylation assay, epi-GBS, to
identify genome-wide epigenetic signatures associated
with inbreeding and sexual trait expression.
Overall, this project will tackle an important knowledge
gap by combining detailed data from multiple sexual
traits over individual lifespans with genomic and epi-
genetic data in a classical lekking species. The PhD
student will therefore have a fantastic opportunity to
tackle sexual selection using a number of innovative and
cutting-edge approaches.
Applicant' ^As prole We seek a bright and highly moti-
vated student who holds a good rst degree and an M.Sc.
or equivalent in a relevant topic (e.g. molecular ecol-
ogy, population genomics, bioinformatics). The ideal
candidate will have strong quantitative skills, including
prociency in working in R and writing custom scripts.
Practical experience of working with next generation se-
quence data (e.g. RAD sequencing, SNP array or whole
genome resequencing) would be advantageous, but full
training will be provided. The candidate should also
be able to work both independently and as part of a
multidisciplinary team. A high standard of spoken and
written English is required.
The working environment The PhD student will be based
at the Department of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld
University, Germany (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/-20 EvolDir April 1, 2021
vhf/index.html). The department is the oldest of its
kind in Germany and currently hosts seven principal in-
vestigators, nine postdocs and 15 PhD students. It oers
a stimulating, supportive and highly international envi-
ronment as well as an excellent research infrastructure.
The working language of the Department is English.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with an attrac-
tive historical centre and easy access to the Teutoberger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It is an af-
fordable and pleasant city to live in and is well connected
to most major European cities.
This project is lab based and is located at Bielefeld Uni-
versity, but the PhD will also spend some time at the
University of Lincoln (https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home)
and at the Netherlands Institute

JagiellonianU HGT PhageEvolution
| PhD student in the area of bioinformatics of bacteria-
phage interactions |
>General description We are inviting applications for
a PhD student in the area of bioinformatics of bacteria-
phage interactions. The successful candidate will join
the Microbial Genomics Group at Malopolska Centre
of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow
(https://mostowylab.com). This is a 4-year National
Science Foundation (ncn.gov.pl) funded position, avail-
able from October 2021, with the exact start date to be
agreed on.
The successful candidate will work on bioinformatics and
genomics of phages that infect opportunistic bacterial
pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae and interact with
their polysaccharide capsules. Bacterial polysaccharides
are known to be highly diverse, both structurally and
genetically, however evolutionary forces that drive that
diversity are not fully understood (Mostowy & Holt
2018, Trends Microbiol). Hence, to better understand
and quantify evolution of phages, we need tools that can
inform us how evolutionary process, like mutation and
horizontal gene transfer (HGT), shape phage diversity
at dierent levels, from domains, to proteins, to modules
and genomes.
As a successful candidate, you will work on a new gen-
eration of bioinformatic methods to study how HGT
impacts bacterial genome. Specically, you will com-
bine state-of-the-art approaches in the eld of microbial
genomics (e.g., pan-genome view of microbial diversity)
with those in phylogenomics (e.g., tree reconciliation
methods) to reconstruct how phage diversity emerges at
dierent levels and how it shapes evolution of bacterial
genomes. You will design new bioinformatic methods for
the phage biology community and apply them on large
datasets consisting hundreds of thousands of genomes of
both lytic and lysogenic phages. You will interact with
other members of our rapidly growing group working
on microbial genomics and work together as a team.
You will work in collaboration with other top research

We are seeking a motivated Masters student for a project:
Biological Clocks in the Wild: the eects of articial
light at night on circadian rhythms of a migratory bird
at the Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian
University (Poland)
What do we study: It is well established that biolog-
ical rhythms are fundamental drivers of biochemistry,
cell biology, physiology and behaviour. The regularity
of behaviours is governed by endogenous clocks, which
are adjusted and synchronised with environmental cues,
primarily light. Rapidly expanding anthropopressure
largely disrupts these cues. Yet, it is surprising how little
we know about the eects of disorders in the function-
ing of the internal time-keepers in free-ranging animals.
The project will aim at understanding the eects of
disturbance in environmental cues, i.e. light exposure,
on circadian clock of a wild migratory bird: collared
ycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We will employ an ex-
perimental setup introducing articial light at night in
nestboxes during breeding season, at dierent stages
of development and quantify its eects on circadian
clock, physiology and behaviour. As a result we will
try to build a comprehensive understanding of shifts in
circadian rhythms and their consequences in a natural
population.
Job description: The MSc candidate will actively par-
ticipate in eldwork (collecting phenotypic, biological
and environmental data), analytical and lab work. S/he
will be interacting with the PI and other team members,
collaborators in Poland and worldwide, and attend rel-
evant workshops and conferences. It is expected that
the candidate will learn a large ecological skill set that
will allow him/her to infer the evolutionary ecology of
disturbed photoperiods in wild ycatchers. Specically,
the thesis will focus on the behavioral part of the project
and the tasks will involve:
* active participation in eldwork across two breeding
seasons (ca. 2-3 months each year) on the Swedish island
of Gotland, * installation of cameras and light sources
in randomly selected nestboxes, * recording, and then
carefully viewing behavioral responses of birds in a ded-
icated software, * analysing the results in cooperation
with other team members.Salary: A National Science Centre stipend (2000
PLN/month, tax-free stipend) is available for 24 months.
Requirements:
1) Formal conditions:
* admission (or being already enrolled) to an MSc pro-
gram at the Jagiellonian University (for example pro-
grams in English: https://studia.eko.uj.edu.pl/en GB/-
ecoevo, https://studia.eko.uj.edu.pl/en GB/epm or pro-
grams in Polish)
2) Specic merit requirements for the project include:
* strong English language command, communication,
organizational and collaboration skills; * experience
with eld work (preferably with birds) is considered ad-
vantageous; * bird ringing/handling experience, ethical
permits to work with animals and driving license are a
plus.

ieu Joron, on the modes of diversication of an alpine
buttery species complex along the altitudinal gradient.
Application deadline: 11 April 2021.
Starting date: between June and November 2021.
Announcement and application details (CNRS por-
tal): https://bit.ly/3ltsIbK Information and enquiry:

ment:
The proposed work is part of a collaborative project
to investigate the modes of diversication of an alpine
buttery species complex along the altitudinal gradient.
Our goal is to identify the mechanisms underlying the re-
peated evolution of reproductive barriers among closely-
related species adapted to dierent altitudinal niches,
but still interconnected by gene-ow. Co-investigators
are Laurence Despres at University of Grenoble and24 EvolDir April 1, 2021
Claire Lemaitre at INRIA Rennes, and their associated
teams.
The student will be in charge of characterising phe-
notypic variation for traits involved in reproductive
isolation and in adaptation to altitude, in order to un-
derstand their role in the diversication of this complex.
Chemical, morphological, physiological or life history
traits can be assumed to play a role in this adaptive
radiation, and may be investigated using a combination
of experimental and analytical approaches. Another aim
is to identifying the genomic regions associated with
variation at those traits to understand the genomic and
genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation.
We are looking for a highly motivated student with
great academic achievement, a clear interest and top-
level education in evolutionary ecology and population
genetics, independent thinking and experience with eld
ecology and/or experimental approaches. Independence
and motivation are essential to successfully carry out
challenging eld and experimental work. The project
allows for much exibility in the questions tackled by
the student, depending on her/his interest, skills, and
ideas.
The studentship is funded by an ANR grant for col-
laborative research and the student will join a lively
consortium of teams whose research combines experi-
mental ecology, population genomics, and bioinformatics.
The student will be based at CEFE in Montpellier, with
summer eld work in the Alps.
The CEFE is the largest ecology lab in France and a
major institute for evolutionary ecology and genetics
worldwide. Our group focuses on buttery ecology and
genomes to decipher how diversity is shaped by natural
selection and other processes. Montpellier is a major
hotspot for evolutionary and environmental research

dred researchers in biological sciences and biodiversity,
and highly praised graduate programmes. The Univer-
sity of Montpellier ranked 1st worldwide in the 2018
Shanghai ranking in Ecology. Montpellier lies near the
Mediterranean region in the South of France and enjoys
pleasant weather, fantastic nature and great cultural
and city life.
Starting date should be as soon as possible but
no later than the end of 2021. Net salary is around

WHAT: Grad student (PhD),
Start date: Fall 2021
Members in the Department of Natural Resource Sci-
ences at McGill University are seeking highly motivated
applicants for graduate student and research technician
positions for the FISHSENS project for Fall 2021. Most
marine shes in Canada's Arctic are not well enough
known to assess how they will be aected by climate
change, information which is urgently needed to reduce
Arctic biodiversity loss and protect northern cultural
and food systems.
FISHSENS will combine genomics data with dietary
and movement assessments to develop tools needed by
federal and Inuit co-management partners to establish
Arctic marine sh monitoring strategies and assess their
sensitivity to climate change. Recruited candidates will
develop projects combining laboratory and data analy-
sis approaches and will collaborate with Canadian aca-
demic, government, and Inuit organizations in Nunavut
and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest
Territories.

The Evolutionary Ecology of Venus' ^A looking glass:
breeding system evolution, cryptic species, and climate
change.
Plant Biology Program, College of Science, Southern
Illinois University, Carbondale, IL.
The Weber Lab is actively recruiting MS and PhD stu-
dents to work on a wide range of research questions
in the plant genus Triodanis (and/or the sister genus
Legousia). These small annual plants exhibit fascinating
variation in breeding systems, intriguing biogeographi-
cal patterns, and established phenological responses to
climate change. We are seeking students with interests
in any aspect of the current research program. Projects
would be developed with input from the student, but
listed below are a couple of potential topics for graduate
research:
1. What are the consequences for climate change on
breeding system evolution and/or plasticity? Species in
the native North American genus Triodanis exhibit a
mixed mating system, with some owers specialized for
obligate self-fertilization. This breeding system varies
among populations, and this variation is associated with
environmental variation. With an extensive herbarium
record, access to hundreds of eld sites, and a tractable
growth protocol 'V this system is well suited for ex-
amining the consequences of changing climate on plant
breeding systems. As well, we can estimate the ge-
netic and phenotypic consequences of changing climate
with growth chamber, and molecular techniques. 2. To
what extent is phenological behavior driven by plastic-
ity and/or evolutionary history? Several species in the
genus Triodanis exhibit shifts towards earlier owering
associated with earlier and warmer springs. Relatively
few studies have examined patterns of phenological sen-
sitivity or phenological niche at the genus (or broader)
levels. We have extensive and detailed data of pheno-
logical patterns for both Triodanis and the sister genus,
Legousia. Combined with climate data, this provides
immense opportunity to examine the relative contribu-
tions of plasticity and genetics on phenological behavior.
In addition, this system is highly tractable for investigat-
ing the consequences of shifts in phenology for overall
impacts on plant life history (i.e., does earlier owering
increase the owering window, or does it lead to earlier
senescence?).32 EvolDir April 1, 2021

We are interested in understanding the diversity of
pathogen resistance within wild plant species. There-
fore we study dierent populations from a diverse and
geographically dierentiated tomato species, Solanum
chilense. We have shown that populations show dierent
levels of defence against a range of pathogens and have
identied patterns of dierential selection for defence-
associated genes. However, the implications of these
ndings on a molecular level remain unknown.
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD student to in-
vestigate the underlying molecular mechanisms and the
eects on plant defence mechanisms in an evolutionary
context, using a combination of genomics, transcrip-
tomics and metabolomics.

The Junior Research Group Global Change Ecology (Dr.
Jonas Jourdan) at the Institute of Ecology, Evolution
and Diversity of the Goethe University Frankfurt am
Main, is seeking one Research Assistant (f/m/d) (PhD
student) (E13 TV-GU, 65%-parttime) within the frame-
work of the research project \Convergent characteristics
of cryptic species along environmental gradients" funded
by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The posi-
tion is limited to a period of 3 years, starting on July
1st, 2021.
Project Rationale: The emergence of genetic methods
has led to the discovery of an increasing number of
species that previously could not be distinguished from
one another on the basis of morphological characteris-
tics. The family Gammaridae (Crustacea, Amphipoda)
is a prime example of a group that has recently seen
a high degree of genetic diversity uncovered. Some of
these genetic lineages have expanded their range in re-
cent times, while others continue to have very small
distributions. However, the reasons for this, as well
as general ecological dierences among these so-called34 EvolDir April 1, 2021
cryptic species, are poorly understood to date. The
PhD position includes a unique combination of eld
work in the Balkans, experimental work and labora-
tory work, combining evolutionary biology with aspects
of ecology and ecotoxicology. The overall goal of this
interdisciplinary project is to investigate the question
of ecological dierentiation of closely related cryptic
species under varying environmental conditions using
the species complex Gammarus roeselii as an example.
Your prole: The successful candidate holds a degree
(M.Sc.) in a relevant eld (e.g., biology, ecology, water
science, molecular biology, environmental sciences or ap-
plied mathematics/computer science) and has a sound
knowledge in molecular genetic methods (e.g., DNA
barcoding, metabarcoding) and experimental work. Ide-
ally, the candidate has the necessary practical skills to
conduct multivariate statistical analysis of ecological
data (preferably in R). Publication experience in scien-
tic journals is an advantage. Furthermore, a class B
driver's license, a high ability to work under pressure,
very good organizational and communication skills are
required. Excellent English skills, oral as well as written
are required. German language skills are helpful but
not mandatory.
We oer a creative, appreciative working environment
with a high degree of personal responsibility in a young
and motivated team. You will benet from a research
network of national and international cooperation part-
ners and can take advantage of further qualication
opportunities through the Goethe Research Academy
for Early Career Researchers (GRADE).

The water ea Daphnia is a popular model system to
study evolution, ecology, and development. DaphniaApril 1, 2021 EvolDir 37
are globally widespread in freshwaters, have short gen-
eration times, and clonal lineages can be maintained
in the laboratory, which facilitates experimental evo-
lution and laboratory assays of genes and traits that
drive evolution over time. Here we are employing an
existing mesocosm setup to study the eects of nutri-
ent availability and community composition on popula-
tion genetics and host microbiomes of Daphnia pulex
and Daphnia magna to better understand the dynam-
ics of abiotic and biotic factors on species success and
survival (in collaboration with Jelena Pantel, https:/-

types of both Daphnia species are exposed in combina-
tion and alone to increased/decreased nutrient levels
to assess how community composition aect patterns
of genotype diversity and the microbiome within and
between species. Importantly, this is a multigeneration
experiment where selection eects from one generation
to the next can be tracked. Further, the opportunity for
manipulative experiments is provided (e.g., provisioning
of selected microbes to assess probiotic eects, eect of
additional stressor, etc.). The project aims to measure
genotype/allele frequencies using whole genome pool se-
quencing, assess microbiome dynamics through marker
gene sequencing, and to collect a suite of physiological
parameters to assess how external factors shape species
survival/dynamics. The project is a collaborative eort
between the Becks, Meyer, and Voolstra labs, integrated
in the doctoral program of University of Konstanz and
the Research Training Group R3 (www.rtg-resilience.uni-

www.campusgotland.uu.se . Project description: Cod is
one of the most important sh species in the Baltic Sea,
but the Baltic cod population has collapsed during the
last decade. One of the main reasons for the population
collapse is high mortality at egg stage. Project ReCod, a
collaboration between Uppsala University and BalticWa-
ters2030 (www.balticwaters2030.org), aims to develop
the methodology to push the cod population through
the vulnerable egg stage by releasing hatchery-reared
yolk-sac larvae at carefully selected sites. This will be
done by producing large number of yolk-sac larvae under
optimal conditions in the hatchery. The ultimate goal
is to strengthen and rebuild populations of the top sh
predator in the Baltic sea. The project is led by Prof
Anssi Laurila (scientic leader) and Prof Gunilla Rosen-
qvist (head of Research station Ar) in collaboration with
the project leader from BalticWaters2030.

environmental surveys at the release sites to assess fac-
tors aecting the establishment success. You will also
conduct experimental studies to assess factor aecting
establishment success.
Position 2: Phenotypic and genetic variation in early
life history of the Baltic cod. The thesis focuses on the
role of environmental variation in the performance of
cod eggs and larvae and its potential on increasing sur-
vival through these stages. Another topic is phenotypic
and genetic variation within the eastern population of
the Baltic cod. You will use laboratory and eld ex-

We are looking for a PhD student to perform part of
a larger, lab wide project entitled: \Comparative stud-
ies on insects: a focus on body size" nanced by Es-
tonian Research Council (2020-2024) and carried out
at Estonia's leading research centre: the University of
Tartu (https://www.ut.ee/en). The lab wide project
focuses on reconstructing moth phylogenies based on
DNA sequences and performing various analyses of trait
evolution on the basis of these novel phylogenies. The
PhD thesis work advertised here will concentrate on
several sub-tasks, such as acquisition of nucleotide data
from a number of moth species either by anchored hy-
brid enrichment technology and/or more traditional
Sanger sequencing, and constructing phylogenies us-
ing both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phyloge-
netic inference. In addition, depending on the interests
of the student, there will be possibilities to take partin more ecology-oriented subprojects, primarily those
on phylogenetic comparative analyses of life history
traits. The work will be supervised by Dr. Erki ~Aunap
and Prof. Toomas Tammaru (http://www.ut.ee/ ~tam-
marut). The group has a solid background in evolu-
tionary ecology of insects, phylogenetic analyses and
taxonomy of Lepidoptera, as well as collaboration ties
with various universities across Europe. PhD studies
in Estonia last for 4 years and publishing research pa-
pers is a requirement; PhD students receive competitive
scholarships allowing them to work on their thesis full
time (alongside taking some relevant classes). A suc-
cessful candidate will have an excellent academic record,
experience with phylogenetic analyses and interest in
evolutionary biology. Some experience and/or genuine

SexDeterminationEvolution
Graduate position: Genomics of Sex Determination in
a viviparous reptile with genotypic and temperature-
dependent sex determination
Project theme:
Sex-determination controls the most signicant varia-
tion within animals- the division into males and females.
While the dierent systems of sex-determination involv-
ing genetic or environmental control are relatively well
understood, transitions between these systems remain
enigmatic in evolutionary biology. This project aims
to address this gap by revealing the genomic changes
required to transition between modes, using one of only
two known lizard species exhibiting both genetic and
temperature control of sex. This knowledge will have
important implications for species conservation, facil-
itating predictions of highly biased sex ratios under
climate change, plus potential commercial applications
for species where the production of one sex is favoured.
A PhD position is available to contribute to this re-
search. This student will conduct advanced genomic
research on species of Australian lizards to decipher theApril 1, 2021 EvolDir 41
changes accompanying transitions between genetic and
temperature-dependent sex determination.
This collaborative research project is funded by an
Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant
awarded to the University of Tasmania (Assoc Profs
Chris Burridge and Erik Wapstra), the University of
Canberra (Prof Tariq Ezaz), and the University of Aus-
tria (Prof Oleg Simakov). This PhD project will be
based at the University of Tasmania, but there is po-
tential for a remote start given current travel restric-
tions to Australia. The project involves a variety of
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and bioinformat-
ics, including assembly, annotation, and comparative
mapping.
The Ideal Candidate
The ideal candidate is expected to have knowledge in
genomics (e.g. NGS technology and bioinformatics).
Knowledge of chromosome biology and sex determi-
nation is also desirable. The candidate will be self-
motivated and well-organised, with a demonstrated ca-
pacity to learn and apply the broad skill set necessary
for the successful completion of a research project. The
successful candidate will be able to work alongside a
wide variety of people in multi-function and multicul-
tural laboratories. The successful candidate will also
have a strong commitment to excellence in research and
scholarship.
Scholarships
Financial support for domestic and international stu-
dents is available for a high achieving student through
a University of Tasmania scholarship (applications re-
ceived continuously, but earlier applications have greater
chance of success). These scholarships are highly com-
petitive. To be competitive, candidates should have a

Versailles FruitFlys
To Evolutionary Biologists,
Please consider the following funded Ph.D. opportunity,
Autumn 2021-2024, to be forwarded to any potential
candidates.
Ph.D. title: Molecular and functional evolution of
olfactory-guided attractive behavior in Tephritidae fruit
ies
Ph.D. topic: Fruit ies of the family Tephritidae are the
main pests of fruit and vegetable crops. Many species
are highly invasive and spread outside their region of
origin where they reduce or displace native populations.
The oriental fruit y (Bactrocera dorsalis), the melonfruit y (Zeugodacus cucurbitae) and the Mediterranean
fruit y (Ceratitis capitata) are among the most emblem-
atic species of this family. Agroecological management
of these pests integrates the use of attractants, includ-
ing food lures (which are not very specic and have low
attraction power) and male attractants. The latters
are pheromonal precursors that provide a reproduc-
tive advantage to the males that consume them. The
attractiveness of these compounds is variable among
Tephritidae species. The main objective of this thesis is
to identify and characterize the main receptors of male
attractants of several species of tephritids, opening the
way to the search for new agonists that will be potential
attractants. The Research will be subdivided into two
secondary objectives: (a) studying the neural coding of
attraction behavior and (b) testing hypotheses for the
evolution of insect olfactory systems.
Name of the scientic managers: Emmanuelle Jacquin-
Joly, DR, INRAE Vincent Jacob, PhD, CIRAD
Working environment: The applicant will alternately
integrate two laboratories that will co- supervise the
thesis. (1) At the Sensory Ecology department of UMR
iEES-Paris (https://iees-paris.fr/departements/ecologie-
sensorielle/), INRAE Versailles campus, France, the
applicant will have access to Drosophila genetic manip-
ulation, electrophysiological equipment, and expertise
in molecular phylogeny of insect odorant receptors (2)
At UMR PVBMT (CIRAD -Universit e de la R eunion),
Saint-Pierre, Ile de la R eunion, the applicant will dis-
pose of eight Tephritidae species of agronomic interest
routinely reared, as well as electrophysiological and be-
havioral testing equipment.
Application: Applicants should send a CV +
motivation+ two letters of reference to Emmanuelle
Jacquin-Joly : emmanuelle.joly@inrae.fr and Vincent
Jacob : vincent.jacob@cirad.fr before June the 1rst 2021
Candidate skills: We are looking for a candidate highly
motivated to study insect behavior and its physiological
and molecular mechanisms. The student will have the
opportunity to carry out part of his/her thesis on a trop-
ical island, Reunion Island, so adaptability is essential.
Preference will be given to candidates with experience
in insect behavior, electrophysiology or molecular phy-
logeny. Programming skills will be appreciated.

blackbirds (Turdus merula) to investigate the physiolog-
ical mechanisms of partial migration, with a focus on
the immune system. At present we have just under 200
colour-ringed birds in Lund that we monitor using radio
telemetry and eld observations. We use these data
in combination with measurements taken from blood
samples to assess whether immune function is a cause
or consequence of partial migration.
Job description: The eld assistant will work alongside
other team members to observe and recapture colour-
ringed blackbirds in/around Lund. Capture methods
will include mist-nets and snap traps. The eld assistant

ringed blackbirds in the eld, helping to set up and
monitor mist nets and/or snap traps, extracting and
processing birds and recording data.
Requirements: He/she must be condent with setting
up mist nets and handling/extracting a range of small
passerine species unsupervised. Experience with colour
ringing and taking more detailed biometric measure-
ments (e.g., tarsus length, moult score), as well as radio
telemetry is desirable but not essential. Ideally, the
candidate would be available full-time for a period of 3
months between April and July. Prociency in English
language (spoken and written) and the ability to ride a
bike are essential.

Working Groups: September 6 - November 19, 2021
During the 2021 BIOME Institute, participants will ex-
plore how pedagogy can guide students to see the forest
and the trees{we'll focus on practices and resources that
help learners incorporate detailed understandings into
a meaningful framework, a scientic worldview, that
will enable them to make predictions, solve problems,
and see science in a broader, interdisciplinary context.
The theme takes its cues from education research which
indicates that providing overarching concepts can help
students better retain and contextualize the details of
biological processes.
The Institute will have a parallel emphasis on how our
scientic worldviews are enriched by the diversity of our
communities. We aim to support faculty in incorpo-
rating more inclusive teaching practices, with the goal
of better preparing students to build a broad scientic
worldview that reects the interdisciplinarity of modern
scientic practice. We also want to help faculty empower
students to communicate scientic ideas eectively both
within and beyond the classroom.

Dear Colleague:
This is to announce a new, paid summer research op-
portunity for undergraduate students, at the University
of Cincinnati's Department of Biological Sciences - the
National Science Foundation-sponsored Research Ex-
periences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Sensory
Ecology. Our program is focused on research at theintersection of neurobiology, behavior, ecology and evo-
lution, and is directed at understanding how animals
use their senses to respond to their environment at func-
tional and evolutionary levels. Sophomore and junior
Biology major students will be chosen to join active
lab groups for the summer and conduct cutting edge
research over a broad spectrum of topics in sensory
ecology, including:
* Genomics and development of sensory systems * Neu-
ral mechanisms of sensory system function * Sensory
perception and behavioral inuences of the physical en-
vironment * Neuroethology * Animal communication *
Behavioral ecology of animal movement and dispersal
An educational program will develop student research
and professional skills and prepare them for graduate
school or careers.
*~10 weeks in summer (June 1 - Aug 6, 2021) * Stu-
dents will receive a summer stipend plus dorm and meal
expenses * Students will work in labs, interact w/ fac-
ulty mentors, post-docs and grad students * Weekly
group seminars and meetings for students (e.g., career
development, responsible research conduct, science com-
munication training) * Social events for students (e.g.,
trips to Cincinnati Zoo, Reds baseball) * Concluding

MolEcolPrize2021 Nominations
We are soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular
Ecology Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scientic
society, so there is no body that actively promotes the
discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial board
of the journal Molecular Ecology therefore created the
Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void, and
recognize signicant contributions to this area of re-
search. The prize selection committee is independent of
the journal and its editorial board.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to molecular ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previous
winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf, Louis Bernatchez,
Nancy Moran, Robin Waples, Scott Edwards, and Vic-
toria Sork.April 1, 2021 EvolDir 69
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words; longer submissions
will not be accepted) and the candidate's CV directly to
Scott Edwards (sedwards@fas.harvard.edu) by Friday,
April 16, 2021. Organized campaigns to submit multiple

PlantEvolutionaryEcol
Dear colleagues,
The Anderson lab at the University of Georgia is search-
ing for an enthusiastic undergraduate with a strong
interest in evolutionary ecology for eld research in
an NSF REU position (National Science Foundation,
Research Experience for Undergraduates) from June-
August 2021. We study the ecological and evolutionary
consequences of climate change for natural plant popula-
tions. We focus on research on Drummond' ^As rockcress
(Boechera stricta in the plant family Brassicaceae), a
mustard plant native to the Rocky Mountains. Our
studies take place around the Rocky Mountain Biolog-
ical Lab (http://www.rmbl.org/), which is located in
Gothic, Colorado near the wildower capital of Colorado
(Crested Butte). We quantify plant tness and traits to
ask whether climate change could disrupt long-standing
patterns of local adaptation, and to test whether pheno-
typic plasticity will enable populations to persist in the
short-term. We perform large-scale reciprocal transplant
experiments to examine patterns of adaptive evolution
and natural selection in contemporary landscapes. Since
fall 2013, we have planted >150,000 seeds and seedlings
into ve experimental gardens ranging in elevation from
2500 m to 3340 m (8202 feet to 11000 feet). Our summer
research involves intensive monitoring of these exper-
imental plants to record data on germination success,
survival, growth, reproductive success, as well as life
history and morphological traits. We conduct most of
our work in the eld, with a small proportion of indoor
lab work.
Undergraduate students are eligible for this REU po-
sition. If you will graduate prior to eld work, please
consider applying to our eld technician positions.
The successful candidate will assist with ongoing eld-
work. In addition, there are many opportunities for
students to develop independent projects associated
with our overall objectives, including studies on: 1)
population divergence in ecologically-relevant traits, es-
pecially drought, UV tolerance, and herbivore resistance;
2) phenotypic plasticity at multiple spatial scales; 3)
population density and species composition of the herbi-
vore community that attacks Drummond' ^As rockcress;4) ower color polymorphism; and 5) the importance
of maternal eects in biological responses to climate
change.
We are oering a stipend of $500/week for a full time
REU student (40 hours/week) for 10 weeks. The exact
start and end dates are exible. We will cover room and
board at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and
reimburse travel expenses up to $500. Fieldwork will
involve hiking to experimental gardens through rough
terrain (1-3 miles one-way daily).
The University of Georgia is committed to maintain-
ing a fair and respectful environment for living, work,
and study. We celebrate diversity in human iden-
tity, experience, and perspective. Collectively, we ex-
cel when we learn from each other and when we re-
main open to new points of view. We seek to cul-
tivate an inclusive lab culture, open to people of all
racial, socioeconomic, religious, cultural backgrounds,
family structure, gender identities, and sexual orienta-
tions, and to people with disabilities. To this purpose,
we encourage applications from individuals excited to
study evolutionary ecology in nature. Members of the
Anderson eld team are expected to be masked and

FieldworkVolunteers Snapdragons
Fieldwork volunteers wanted: Help us study plant evo-
lution in the Spanish Pyrenees!
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and Tech-
nology (IST) Austria https://ist.ac.at/en/research/-
barton-group/ is looking for volunteers to assist with
eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees (Spain)
this coming summer (late May - early August). This
is a great opportunity for anybody looking to obtain
experience in eld work relating to evolutionary biology,
speciation, plant ecology and plant-animal interactions.
The project: We study evolutionary dynamics and speci-
ation in snapdragons. The study'Xwhich has been run-
ning since 2011'Xinvolves eld work on natural hybrid
zones between two subspecies with dierent coloured
owers. The goal is to understand how dierent evolu-
tionary forces'Xlike natural selection'Xhave shaped this
diversity.
The eldwork: We are seeking volunteers to assist with
the eld work, which involves working in teams to map
the location of individual plants (GPS), tag and sample
them for leaves and owers, measuring traits, and pro-
cessing material for later DNA extraction. There may
also be opportunities to be involved in other projects
focusing on pollinator behaviour and plant-insect in-
teractions. Most of the work is outdoors, but we do
spend some time indoors processing samples. The work
is highly team orientated, typically in groups of 2-3 in
the eld and larger groups processing samples back at
the research station.
The location: is near Ripoll in a beautiful part of the
Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia). We stay
in comfortable apartments overlooking a picturesque
valley, with close access to hiking trails and small vil-
lages.April 1, 2021 EvolDir 73
The ideal applicant: is an enthusiastic, hardworking bi-
ology student with strong interest in working outdoors.
You must be meticulous with recording data and also
be comfortable working as part of a team. Experience
with eld-based projects and plants is helpful but not
essential. Climbing experience is useful as some work
is conducted on ropes. We are looking for volunteers
between the 29th May and the 1st of August. The
length of stay is exible but we ask people to commit
to a minimum 3 week stay. Applicants must be located
in the Europe or the UK.
What we cover: All food, lodgings and any travel within
Europe/UK are covered.
How to apply? By the closing date of April 10th, please
send (i) your CV, (ii) a short explanation about why
you are interested, and (iii) your availability between
the above dates to eldvolunteer2021@gmail.com
Please send any questions to the same address.
*A note about Covid19 Although we are planning the
eld season optimistically, the Covid19 pandemic may
force use to change/cancel our plans at very short notice.
We will give as much notice as possible regarding any
changes. Assuming the eld season proceeds normally,
all and volunteers will be required to present a negative
Covid test prior to their arrival in the eld.

VertebrateEvolution
Postdoctoral Fellow, Vertebrate Zoology, American Mu-
seum of Natural History. New York, USA
The American Museum of Natural History is recruiting
an exceptional postdoc to be part of a highly innovative
project to optimize techniques in isolating historical
DNA (hDNA), modeling DNA degradation, and an-
alyzing DNA from specimens in the herpetology and
ornithology collections at the (AMNH). This project
is funded by a National Science Foundation award to
Christopher Raxworthy and Brian T. Smith in the Di-
vision of Vertebrate Zoology, AMNH.
This NSF-funded project aims to develop ecient andopen-source protocols for yielding genome-scale molec-
ular data from typical traditional museum specimens,
based on rigorous experiments using time-series collec-
tions at the AMNH. Museum specimens of amphibians,
reptiles, and birds will be sampled for DNA across two
collecting periods of: 1) <1'V30 years for eld-frozen,
dry and uid preserved voucher tissues, all taken from
the same specimens for which alternative DNA prep
types will be directly compared; and 2) 30'V150 years,
for older traditional voucher specimens which lack frozen
tissue samples. This combined approach will determine
the optimal source and extraction methods for hDNA,
develop improved methods for reverse crosslinking with
formalin-xed DNA, and provide a much deeper un-
derstanding of how DNA degrades due to exposure to
formalin, alcohol, tissue buers, and archival storage
time. This project will also develop pipelines for bioin-
formatics processing of hDNA, to better detect contam-
ination, evaluate the eects of hDNA on phylogenetic76 EvolDir April 1, 2021
inference, and improve the utility of hDNA in all aspects
of comparative biology.
Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: con-
duct and co-design experimental tests of DNA extrac-
tion; prepare samples for molecular sequencing; analyze
molecular data; model DNA degradation across sample
types and time; manage project internet portal and
web pages; co-mentor undergraduate and high school
students; co-develop best-practices for bioinformatics
processing of hDNA; and prepare results for publication
as lead author. The postdoc will have opportunities to
present their work at conferences, attend various profes-
sional development activities, and get to participate on
an expedition to Madagascar to collect samples for the
project. Currently, this is a 2.5 year term position.
Required experience
Ph.D. or equivalent in evolutionary biology, computa-
tional biology, or related elds and demonstrated record
of productivity and publications. Experience with DNA
extraction, next-generation sequencing, wetlab meth-
ods (ideally including ' ^A ¥clean room' ^A DNA labs),
computer programming (e.g., python; R), genomics,
molecular evolution, and vertebrate biology.
For full details about this position please see: https://-
careers.amnh.org/postings/2397 Application review will
begin on March 29, 2021, with a desired start date
of July 1, 2021 Please contact Christopher Raxworthy

About the group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population ge-
netics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity.
We have previously demonstrated that coding sequences
of cancer tumors not only exhibit positively selected
mutations that drive cancer (www.nature.com/articles/-
s41588-019-0572-y), but that there exist genes that the
tumor cannot aord to lose to the mutational pres-
sure (www.nature.com/articles/ng.3987). In addition
to genes, we have also identied cancer driver loci in
the non-coding part of the genome (www.nature.com/-
articles/s41467-017-00100-x), which is another ongoing
research eort in the group.Our group is particularly interested in how the evolu-
tion and survival of cancer cell populations relies on
mutation inux as well as in the selection inference
from allele frequency information. To this end, we de-
velop mathematical and computational approaches to
estimate mutation rates and selection from the data.
Estimates of the strength of selection in cancer allow for
a prioritization of genes and non-coding regions by their
disease relevance, with the ultimate goal of promoting
therapeutic advances.
We have also studied mutation and selection in the
framework of human polymorphisms (www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3831 and academic.oup.com/mbe/article-
abstract/36/8/1701/5475505) and de novo variants
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17162-z). Here,
a particular focus of the group lies on the description
of purifying selection in humans and across species, ac-
counting for mutational processes as well as the eects
of genetic drift.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling lab was estab-
lished in October 2018 and is part of the Bioinfor-
matics and Genomics program at the CRG. Further

Krakow is a beautiful medieval city with a rich history
and a lively cultural life.
The project The maintenance of genetic variation, en-

one of the greatest puzzles in evolutionary biology, be-
cause ubiquitous directional selection should lead to
depletion of genetic variation in selected traits. This
is especially the case with sexually selected traits, in
which directional selection is particularly strong. Yet,
substantial genetic variance in these traits is maintained.
A potent force proposed to maintain genetic variation
is balancing selection, but cases of a detailed dissec-
tion of the mechanisms of that maintain balanced poly-
morphisms are extremely rare. The project will likely
provide a textbook example of balancing selection in
action.
We aim to investigate the maintenance of polymorphismApril 1, 2021 EvolDir 85
in Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6Pgdh), a sexually
selected gene associated with sexual conict in the bulb
mite Rhizoglyphus robini. 6Pgdh polymorphism (with
two alleles, S and F) is associated with dierences in
male reproductive success. The S-bearers have advan-
tage in male-male competition, but decrease fecundity
of their partners. Previous studies suggest that the
nonsynonymous polymorphism dening F and S alleles
is under (relatively) long-term environment-dependent
balancing selection. The project is aimed at identifying
mechanisms driving this selection and investigating its
molecular signitures.
Responsibilities A PostDoc will look for the molecular

expect a strong signal of long-term balancing selection
within the genomic region centered on the F/S dening
nonsynonymous polymorphism. The PostDoc will also
be involved in gathering/analyzing eld data to evaluate
the levels of 6Pgdh polymorphism in natural populations
and determine environmental factors aecting 6Pgdh
allele frequencies in the eld. This second task will be

Michigan State University
Position Summary: The Department of Fisheries andApril 1, 2021 EvolDir 87
Wildlife at Michigan State University invites applica-
tions for the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate,
under the supervision of Drs. Kim Scribner and John
Robinson in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife
at Michigan State University. The successful appli-
cant will join an established collaborative network of
researchers at Michigan State University, the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), and Michi-
gan Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy
(EGLE). The successful candidate will contribute to a
state-funded project focused on utilizing a large suite of
established Red Swamp Craysh SNP loci to reconstruct
pedigrees to characterize environmental features associ-
ated with aspects of the species' mating system, invasion
routes, historical demography, and colonization history
across Michigan landscapes. The appointment is for 18
months beginning in July 2021 through December 2022.
The successful applicant will be provided opportunities
to engage in a wide variety of professional development
activities, depending on their areas of interest (e.g.,
participation in scientic meetings, mentoring in pro-
gramming and scientic ethics, workshops in a targeted
area of study, guest lectures, participation in other col-
laborative population genomics research). Some travel
is possible to participate in eld collection activities
with project collaborators. Opportunities to participate
in planned outreach eorts associated with this project
are also available.
Background: Improved understanding of Red Swamp
Craysh population dynamics would greatly aid Red
Swamp Craysh control eorts in Michigan. Currently,
little is known about mating ecology and movement
dynamics among waterbodies across heterogeneous and
human-altered landscapes. The specic source popula-
tions, sexes, ages, and rate of dispersal and demographic
changes associated with colonization are unclear, partic-
ularly due to the recency of founding events, yet such
information is critical for targeted management actions.
The over-arching project goal is to utilize a large panel of
SNP loci established by our group to improve the under-
standing of Red Swamp Craysh population dynamics
in Michigan to improve control strategies. Specic ob-
jectives are to 1) use genomic methods to quantify gene
ow among infested waterbodies in Michigan, 2) iden-
tify landscape features associated with increased gene
ow, and 3) estimate eective number of breeders and
inter-individual variation in reproductive success.
Qualications: A doctorate in Genetics, Ecology, Evolu-
tionary Biology, or a related eld is required. Demon-
strated experience in population genetics and well-
developed computational skills are also required for
this position. In particular, experience with produc-
tion of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) data sets is required. Previous experience with
programming (R, Python, C++) and analysis of pop-
ulation genomic data (pedigree analysis, Approximate
Bayesian Computation, unsupervised clustering) is de-
sirable. Other desired qualications include a strong
work ethic, problem-solving and time management skills,
experience working with a team and communicating
scientic results. Applicants should demonstrate an in-
terest in joining an established interdisciplinary research
team working at the interface of population genomics,
landscape ecology, and natural resource management.
Application Materials: Interested applicants should sub-
mit a cover letter, statement of research interests, and
contact information for three references through the
Careers @ MSU website - careers.msu.edu (job posting
#: 694182). In addition to the required materials above,
code (e.g., link to a GitHub repository) and writing
samples (i.e., one or more recent publications) are also
strongly encouraged, and will be considered during re-
view. Review of applications will begin on 03/26/2021.

for publication; 5) build relationships with SNR sta
and collaborative partners; and 6) actively participate
in events with the St. Louis Ecology, Evolution, and
Conservation community.
MBG ^A1s Shaw Nature Reserve contains over 2000 acres
of re-maintained woodlands, grasslands, and glades.
Ecological restoration (i.e., selective tree thinning, re-
moval of invasive species, prescribed re) has been on-
going at SNR over the last 3 decades. The restorations
have also involved seeding of native species from local
and regional seed sources, and the successful candidate
will be expected to work on research projects related
to these restored populations of native plants at SNR
and other eld sites and natural areas in the region.
The postdoctoral fellow will be expected to develop a
research project involving testing how factors such as
seed source or life history characteristics (such as mating
system, pollinator, or seed disperser) aect the genetic
diversity and population dynamics of restored plant pop-
ulations. Candidates should have prior experience with
eld sampling techniques, next-generation DNA sequenc-
ing approaches, population genomics lab techniques (i.e.,
rad-seq, genotyping-by-sequencing), bioinformatics, and
statistical analysis of population genomic data. Candi-
dates who are interested in understanding the eects
of plant life-history traits or ecological factors on the
genetic diversity and structure of plant populations are
particularly encouraged to apply. The successful candi-
dates will have opportunities to collaborate with MBG
scientists active in conservation genetics, reintroduction
biology, restoration ecology, and community ecology.
Candidates with a completed Ph.D. or that will soon
graduate with a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology, Botany, Genetics, Restoration Science, Envi-
ronmental Science, Conservation Biology, or a related
eld are encouraged to apply. The ideal start time is
before summer 2021, but this is negotiable. The term
for this grant-funded position will be up to 2 years,with renewal in the 2nd year contingent on satisfac-
tory performance. Salary will be commensurate with
experience, and this position includes a comprehensive
benets package.
The position will be based in St. Louis, where a vibrant
community of ecologists, conservation practitioners, and
evolutionary biologists interact through partnerships
among MBG, Washington University, the University of
Missouri-St. Louis, Saint Louis University, plus other
area institutions. The position will be seated in the
CCSD, which explores and implements new, science-
based approaches to the conservation and sustainable
use of plant diversity. CCSD ^A1s strategies for conser-
vation are based on a sound, scientic understanding
of the occurrence and distribution of plants. CCSD
applies the knowledge of plant diversity accumulated by
Missouri Botanical Garden researchers over many years,
making that knowledge usable for conservation planning
and decision-making. Operating under the auspices of
the Garden and as part of its division of Science and
Conservation, CCSD builds upon the Garden ^A1s insti-
tutional expertise, scientic programs, inuence, and
resources.

3-year Leverhulme-funded Postdoc: \PREADAPT: re-
vealing the basis of whole genome duplication-mediated
adaptation"
Closing Date: Wednesday 24 March 2021
Context: Whole genome duplication (WGD) is an en-
gine of adaptation and speciation across kingdoms, but
the basis for this 'WGD-advantage' has been mysteri-
ous since Haldane considered it in the 1920s. Based
on our preliminary data, we hypothesise that specic
cellular adaptations to WGD itself preadapt certain
lineages to survive subsequent extracellular challenges.
We test this using our unique genomic dataset of thou-
sands of individually sequenced genomes (including ~200
long-read sequenced) from pre- and post-WGD lineages,
both before and after adaptation to challenging habi-
tats, providing the rst genomic assessment of WGD-
mediated adaptability. Further, we seek to determine
precisely what functional adaptive advantage WGD pro-
vides, addressing a fundamental mystery. See https://-
www.yantlab.net/ for more on our group.
Role: Primary activities will include leading large-scale
population genomic projects. This includes exhaustive
demographic and selection analyses. We seek candidates
who are not only motivated to run with these objectives,
but who can also propose new creative project contri-
butions. By the end of your postdoc with us, we expect
you to be able to, for example, begin your own group,
bringing along your project from our work together. We
also expect to engender the development of new direc-
tions as a result of discoveries in our group that can
spur independent trajectories for your future research.
Applicants passionate about evolutionary genetics or
population genomics are encouraged to apply. Candi-
dates must hold a PhD or equivalent in Genetics, Evo-
lution, Bioinformatics, or a closely related area. The
role holder must have demonstrable programming skills
(e.g. scripting in Python or extensive skills in R). Ex-
perience with large scale population genomic data in
HPC environments as well as practical experience of
applying population genomics to biological problems
is required. We are looking for a candidate with good
knowledge of population genetics and demonstrable use
of computational methods in an evolutionary context.Apply here: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/jobs/-

Project summary:
The foundations of modern evolutionary theory assume
that genetic information is transported through a germ
line isolated from the rest of an individual's body, as
a result of early germline segregation. However, this
pattern of early segregation is only observed in a sub-
set of animals, while other animals, all fungi, and all
plants presumably show late germline segregation. This
late segregation has important implications for modu-
lar organisms such as plants,especially in long-lived or
clonally propagated species, since with time individuals
acquire an increasing level of genetic mosaicism, due to
the accumulation of somatic mutations that are trans-
mitted directly to gametic cells. Consequently, older
individuals are expected to show greater intra-individual
genetic diversity, which aects both their contributionto the genetic diversity of the population and their own
reproductive capacities.Despite the clear ecological, evo-
lutionary and even agricultural implications of a late
segregation of the germ line in plants, to date studies
focused on this issue are very scarce. In this project,
we propose as general objectives to characterize and
contrast detectable intra-individual genetic diversity
along a range of life strategies and a mutagenic gra-
dient in natural and articial systems, and to analyze
the implications of early or late germline segregation
in the ecology, genetics and evolution of plant popula-
tions.Working under the general hypothesis that plants
show late germline segregation, we will model and test
the consequences of mutational load on individual ge-
netic variability and the resulting phenotypic variation.
If the observed results contradict the predictions derived
from an absence or late segregation of the germ line,
this would imply evidence in favor of the alternative
hypothesis that early segregation mechanisms exist in
plants. Our research program combines a theoretical ap-
proach for the inference of qualitative and quantitative
predictions, with a phylogenetically broad sampling of
the variation in pollen viability, a variable for which a
dierential response is expected depending on whether
germline segregation is early or late,complemented by a
detailed characterization at the molecular level of the
pattern of somatic mutations and their eects in in-
dividuals of grapefruit, a species of great productive
value. We hope that this project reinforces the current
knowledge about the diversity of germline segregation
strategies, and also generates knowledge with signicant
impact both in basic disciplines(Evolution and Ecology)
and in applied areas (agricultural production). {

introgression and adaptations) occurred in human
history, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how weApril 1, 2021 EvolDir 95
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomic
datasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.
Required qualications: Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics,
genomics, computational biology or related elds and
demonstrated record of productivity and publications.

Description:
The Department of Integrative Biology at the University
of California, Berkeley seeks applications for a Postdoc-
toral scholar in the Koskella Lab, in the area of disease
ecology and microbiome sciences, at 100 % time with an
expected start date of September 2021. Bacteriophage
viruses (phages) impact microbial communities across
habitats, including the host- associated microbiome,
structuring both microbial composition and function.
Since 2017, the Koskella lab has been developing a newurban disease ecology system that allows for temporal
sampling of microbial communities from healthy and dis-
eased tissues across a spatially structured population of
Callery ('Bradford') pear tree s infected with the agricul-
turally relevant pathogen Erwinia amylovora, the causal
agent of Fire Blight. The department is seeking a post-
doctoral researcher to lead a new NSF funded project
that combines culture-dependent screening and culture
- independent 'omics' approaches to explore bacteria-
phage dynamics over both short (monthly) and long
(yearly) time scales to better understand the ecology
and evolution of phage host range, the scale of phage
adaptation and bacterial counter-adaptation, and the
role phages play in shaping pathogen invasion and dis-
ease. The project is based around a tight integration of
research and teaching, and includes the development of a
four module undergraduate research program with high-
throughput, culture independent sequencing of both
bacterial and viral communities to examine the role
of phages in bacterial community turnover and disease
in this Pear Tree system. The work will take place in
the laboratory of Dr. Britt Koskella, at UC Berkeley,
and will include a combination of local eldwork and
bacterial viral community proling/'omics' approaches.
Responsibilities: Responsibilities include eld sampling
of trees, microbiological culturing, extraction and anal-
ysis of both amplicon and metagenomic datasets, sta-
tistical analyses, and preparation of manuscripts for
publication. In addition, the researcher will work with
the PI to lead a team of up to 12 undergraduate re-
searchers to isolate and characterize phages from the
phyllosphere. There also exists ample opportunity to
design and implement additional projects of mutual
interest.
Minimum/Basic Qualications required at the time of
application: PhD (or equivalent international degree)
or enrolled in a PhD degree program (or equivalent in-
ternational degree program) at the time of application.
Preferred Qualications: Given the undergraduate re-
search component of this project, the preferred candi-
date would have a keen interest in integration of teaching
and research and undergraduate mentoring. Moreover,
preference will be given to applicants with experience
in bioinformatics, microbial ecology, molecular biology,
statistics, and/or disease ecology, as well as excellent
writing and communication skills.

show substantial resistance variation to pathogens that100 EvolDir April 1, 2021
a species does not normally encounter in nature. This
resistance is often correlated, either positively or neg-

more frequently encountered. How do these correlations
evolve? And what are the consequences of resistance
correlations for invasion by a foreign pathogen? The
postdoc will work to develop general theoretical models
that examine the co-evolutionary processes that give rise
to resistance correlations between endemic and foreign
pathogens. The project is in collaboration with Michael

tion at the Research Institute on Insects Biology (IRBI)
located at the University of Tours, France, to work on
THE ROLE OF GUT MICROBIOTA IN THE EARLY
EVOLUTION OF INSECTS' SOCIAL LIFE
CONTEXT. A long-standing problem in biology is to
understand why and how animal social life has emerged
from a solitary state. We aim to address these ques-
tions by testing whether social life may not only emerge
due to its benets for the group members but also due
to its benets for their gut microbiota. The applicant
will design and conduct a series of standardized experi-ments with the European earwig Forcula auricularia
to identify which gut microbes are associated with host
sociality, test how these microbes can benet from and
increase the sociality of their hosts, and shed light on
the mechanisms allowing these gut microbes to modify
hosts sociality. The project mostly relies on metabarcod-
ing, behavioural experiments and/or RNA-seq analyses
(depending on candidate interests).
REQUIREMENTS. The position requires a PhD in bi-
ology or microbiology (or a related eld) completed at
the beginning of the contract. The successful candidate
will have experience in developing and implementing
DNA barcode approaches, ideally on insects' gut mi-
crobiota, as well as good practice in molecular biology
techniques and analyses. Strong interests in evolution-
ary biology and social evolution, as well as experience in
conducting behavioural experiments are advantageous,
but not required. The position is fully funded by the

funded project in the laboratory of Professor Carol Lee,104 EvolDir April 1, 2021
in the Department of Integrative Biology at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, Madison.
This project focuses on Rapid Evolutionary Responses
to Global Change using the copepod Eurytemora anis
species complex as a model system. With changes in
global climate, coastal high latitude waters are expe-
riencing rapid declines in salinity, due to increases in
ice melt and precipitation. We have found evolutionary
shifts in ion transport function, genome-wide gene ex-
pression, and population genomic signatures of selection
associated with changes in salinity (see pubs in the links
below). This postdoc project will entail conducting
comparative genomic and population genomic analyses
associated with temperature and salinity change in wild
and laboratory populations.
The E. anis complex presents an exemplary model,
with its short generation time (20d), ease of culturing
large numbers (thousands per population), and ability
to generate inbred lines. The Lee Lab is generating
multiple full reference genomes (PacBio and Oxford
Nanopore) from the E. anis species complex to the
chromosome level. Additionally, the multiple indepen-
dent environmental clines have enabled us to observe
exceptional cases of parallel polygenetic adaptation (to
the level of SNPs).
The ideal candidate should hold a Ph.D. and have pub-
lications in peer-reviewed journals. A background in
evolutionary genetics is required, especially in popula-
tion genetics/genomics or comparative genomics. Rele-
vant areas of expertise include molecular evolutionary
genetics, computational and programming skills, and
statistics.
Review of applications will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is lled. The appointment
could persist for up to three years. Interested candi-
dates should email their application to Prof. Carol Lee
(carollee@wisc.edu), including: (1) a CV, (2) a cover
letter describing qualications and relevant experience,
(3) a list of references (recommenders), and (4) samples
of rst authored publications. Enquiries regarding this
position are most welcome.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison oers a large
and intellectually vibrant community of evolution-
ary/population biologists, providing ample opportuni-
ties for interaction with excellent scientists (see https:/-
/evolution.wisc.edu/people/faculty/) and rst rate de-
partments of Statistics and Biostatistics, computational
facilities, and a Biotech Center. Madison is a culturally-
rich community, in relative close proximity to Chicago.

registrations are now open for the ONLINE Physalia
course \Inferring demographic history from population
genomics data": ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/demoinference/ )
Dates: 12th-16th July
Instructor: Dr Vitor C Sousa (Centre for Ecology, Evolu-
tion and Environmental changes, Department of Animal
Biology, Faculdade de Ci^ encias da Universidade de Lis-
boa, University of Lisbon, Portugal)
Teaching Assistants: 1) Dr B arbara Parreira (Centre for

dade de Ci^ encias da Universidade de Lisboa, University
of Lisbon, Portugal)
2) Dr Isabel Alves (INSERM/CNRS UMR-1087, Uni-
versity of Nantes, France)
This course will provide a comprehensive introduction
to population genomics data and methods to model and
infer the demographic history of populations/species.
It will focus on methods based on single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and the site frequency spectrum
(SFS), which can be obtained from whole genome or
reduced representation (e.g.,, GBS, RAD) sequencing
data from model and non-model species.
The course will take participants through all the steps
required for preparing the data, performing and in-
terpreting results from demographic history inference.
Specically, it will go from generating the SFS from VCF
les to formalize hypotheses in terms of demographic
models with parameters of interest (e.g., past eective
sizes, migration rates and times of split).
Participants will learn how to compare alternative mod-
els (model choice) and estimate parameters, as wellApril 1, 2021 EvolDir 107
as simulate data under dierent demographic history
scenarios. By combining lectures addressing key con-
cepts in population genomics with hands-on exercises,
participants will learn key approaches used in popula-
tion genomics that can be applied to several species
and types of data, including low coverage and ancient
DNA. After completing the course, participants should
be able to begin using NGS data to model and infer the
demographic history in their study system of choice.

Jun21-25
Dear all,
the 5th edition of the Landscape Genomics course will
be delivered remotely from the 21st to the 25th of June.
This course is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneti-
cists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evolu-
tionary biology and conservation.
Instructors: Dr St ephane Joost and Dr Elia Vajana
(EPFL, Switzerland).
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, the course
will discuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic
data and subsequently show how to study genetic vari-
ation and population structure across space in the R
environment. Students will be given an overview of the
dierent statistical approaches to study local adapta-
tion, and will be trained in using two of them, Sambada
and LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task
of the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-
nally, the workshop will consider the crucial aspects and
good habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).

Course overview
Transposable elements (TEs) can be major components
of eukaryotic genomes. Such repeated sequences, which
can make up very large proportions like about 50% of
mammalian genomes to more than 80% in the genomes
of some plants, can promote various types of muta-
tions, from gene interruption and expression alteration
to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. They can
also promote the formation of new genes. Despite their
deleterious eects, TEs are currently considered as ma-
jor actors in genome evolution due the genetic and
epigenetic diversity they can generate.
Even if they have a fundamental biological role, detec-
tion and analysis of TE sequences are still technologi-
cally challenging. The length and quality of sequenced
reads make their detection and annotation dicult (40%
detection error). Moreover, the presence of TEs in a
genome can also lead to important assembly errors due
to rearrangement and the merge of repeats, and to di-
culties in the identication of splicing events and in the
estimation of gene expression in transcriptomic analy-
ses. It is thus important to be able to identify these
sequences in genomic and transcriptomic data.
Since several years, a large number of bioinformatic toolshave been developed allowing a better identication of
TEs in genomes. New tools are released regularly to
follow the progress of sequencing technologies but also
to answer particular biological questions allowing to go
from the TE annotation in assembled or unassembled
genomes, to insertion polymorphism detection in natu-
ral populations. The result is a particularly large choice
for users leading to diculties in the determination of
the best tool(s) to use according to the case.
In this course, we aim at proposing an introduction of
selected bioinformatic tools for the detection and analy-
sis of TEs in genomic data (RepeatMasker, DnaPipeTE,
T-lex).

positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
