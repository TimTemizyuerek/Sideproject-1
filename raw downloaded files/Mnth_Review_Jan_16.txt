Biosphere2 Arizona PhenotypeRCN
Feb26-28
The Fifth Annual Summit of the Phenotype Ontology
Research Coordination Network will be held at the Uni-
versity of Arizona's Biosphere2, about 40 miles north of
Tucson, AZ, from February 26-28, 2016 (Friday through
Sunday noon).
The theme of this meeting will be 'Complex data inte-
gration with phenotypes' with a focus on the integration
of phenotype data with other data sets. We will summa-
rize where our phenotype community is at with respect
to integration with other data types, and we will high-
light active projects. We will be looking to the future {
what projects should be priorities for the future? Join-
ing us this year will be folks from the newly funded
'FuturePhy' (futurephy.org), who are interested in how
to integrate multiple data types, including phenotype,
with phylogenetic trees.
We estimate that the costs for this meeting (transporta-
tion to meeting from airport, lodging, food) will be
approximately $500, though we will be able to cover
expenses for a small number of participants, particu-
larly students and postdocs who have specic interests
in using phenotypic data associated with environmentin their research. Please contact one of us if you are
interested in attending. It should be a great meeting!

The Phenotype Ontology RCN (http://-
phenotypercn.org) was funded by the U.S. NSF
to establish a network of scientists who are interested in
comparing phenotypes across species and in developing
the tools and methods needed to enable comparisons.
In contrast to the many well-established eorts in
the molecular community, the representation of
phenotypic traits using ontologies is in its infancy.
Phenotype ontologies, however, have the potential to
integrate these data across all levels of the biological
hierarchy and to the environment. This RCN is
building a community that, because of its expertise,
fosters communications across disciplines to enable
co-development of interoperable community standards
and best practices for phenotype.

MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary
Biology 12-16 June 2016 - Hameau de l'Etoile, Montpel-

Webpage: http://www.lirmm.fr/mceb2016/ Pre-
registration deadline: February 25th Notication to
applicants: March 15th Final list of attendees: April

Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and con-
cepts form an essential basis for modern evolutionary
studies. The goal of the MCEB conference (at its 8th
edition) is to bring together scientists with diverse back-
grounds to present recent advances and discuss openJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 5
problems in the eld of mathematical and computa-
tional evolutionary biology. The theme of this year's
edition will be \forecasting evolution": while most anal-
yses are designed to reconstruct the past in order to
understand evolution, our modern society is in dire
need of anticipating the future using sound scientic
approaches. This is particularly true in the context of
global warming and more generally global changes. New
approaches that model future evolution are emerging,
for example to predict epidemics, evolution of cancer,
shifts in species/population distributions or species loss.
Evolutionary biology is thus widening its focus, try-
ing to predict future biological states and better dene
the range of applicability of these predictions. Making
progress in this new research area will involve cross-
disciplinary approaches, accurate statistical methods,
and powerful computational techniques. Beyond this
year's theme, general concepts, models, methods and
algorithms will be presented and discusse, just as in
the previous editions of MCEB. Keynote speakers will
introduce a eld of research and discuss their own work
in this eld. Afternoon will be for short presentations
and posters, with plenty of time for discussions and
outdoors.
Where and when: Hameau de l'Etoile, near Montpellier,
in the South of France, 12-16 June 2016.
Cost: Conference fees including accommodation for four
nights, meals, coee breaks, buses, etc., will be between
300 and 550, all inclusive, and will vary depending on
the room. PhD students and postdocs will benet of
the cheapest rooms.

Dear Colleague,
I'm writing to let you know about an exciting NEW
meeting to be sponsored by the Genetics Society of
America (GSA). After nearly 100 years of research in
Population, Evolutionary, and Quantitative Genetics
(PEQG), the time has nally come for a meeting to
be focused specically on PEQG. As with the many
other periodic meetings sponsored and managed by the
GSA, the plan is for PEQG to become the premier,
regular gathering of graduate students, postdoctoral
scholars, and established scientists in these central areas
of genetics.
Held in conjunction with The Allied Genetics Confer-
ence (TAGC), or what GSA President Jasper Rine is
referring to as the Totally Awesome Genetics Confer-
ence, PEQG will be part of a genetics conference which
will unite, for the rst time, most of the GSA-sponsored
model organism meetings at one venue. This large meet-
ing coincides with the 100th anniversary of the journal
GENETICS. TAGC Logo
The meeting will be in Orlando, Florida from July 13-17
at the Orlando World Center Marriott, which provides
a campus-like environment for unparalleled network-
ing. In Orlando you will nd inexpensive room rates
and abundant domestic and international ights. Your
meeting budget will stretch further here than at other
venues.
Yes, we know Orlando is hot in the summer - outside.
But inside, the AC will be working and if you want
GREAT science and access to the leaders of the eld,
Orlando is the place for you.
Orlando was chosen to ensure that all submeetings can
be under one roof, making accessible the best that each
eld has to oer, with the addition of a stellar line-up
of featured speakers for the joint plenary sessions tran-6 EvolDir January 1, 2016
scending all aspects of genetics. Check out the TAGC
Website for details, and mark it on your calendar now!
Our PEQG meeting, really a meeting within a meeting,
will present numerous opportunities for sharing research
results and forming lasting collaborations. PEQG will
provide graduate students with the opportunity to ex-
plore post-doctoral interests in other elds, and postdocs
the opportunity to network with faculty from other in-
stitutions. This meeting will also launch the rst James
Crow Award competition for young investigators. With
the promise of providing a breadth of perspective never
before possible at any model-organism focused meeting,
we hope to see you in Orlando this July. Michael Lynch

Conference Announcement: SMBE Satellite Meeting on
the Genetics of Admixed Populations
May 18-20, 2016
San Antonio TX
Studies of admixed populations and the admixture pro-
cess touch on topics central to evolutionary and molec-
ular biology, including the dynamics of gene ow and
hybridization, population expansions, and adaptation.
Admixed populations have been leveraged to detect dis-
ease and phenotypic associations, elucidate mechanisms
and timescales of speciation, and infer regions under
selection. Acting as a natural experiment, admixed
populations provide insight into unique adaptations of
their parental populations, and evolutionary processes
in related populations more generally. Admixture is also
intimately linked with the recombination process, which
shues segments of dierent ancestry, and is proven to
vary in rate and location based on ancestry.
The primary goal of this satellite meeting is to emphasize
the common theoretical and empirical underpinningsof the study of admixed human populations with the
study of hybridization in other animals and even plants,
opening up methods and study design from a specic
organism to a wider audience. We hope to bridge theo-
retical and data-driven approaches, starting a discussion
on the suitability of methods to various systems and
open questions that may be better resolved using an
interdisciplinary approach, as well as considering ethical
concerns associated with these studies.
Workshop sessions include:
Admixture as a dynamic process Novel Methods to
Untangle Admixture Empirical Studies of Population
History Admixture as a Mechanism for and Against
Speciation Admixture and Selection: Phenotypic and
Medical Implications Panel Discussion: Ethical consid-
erations and Sampling Schemes

Genetics and Development of Cooperation FUNDED
PLACES AVAILABLE
Dates: February 24-26 ^th 2016
The Ecology and Evolution group at University of Bern
will host a workshop in February 2016 on the genetics
and development of cooperative behaviour.
The two-day meeting aims to bring together scientists
working on a range of questions important to this area of
research, including quantitative genetics, molecular ge-
netics, transcriptomics, endocrinology, epigenetics, and
maternal eects. As an integrative approach is becoming
increasingly necessary to address these research ques-
tions, the ultimate goal of the meeting will be to discuss
new perspectives and techniques on the genetics and
development of cooperative behaviour. We would like
participants to summarise and synthesise recent progress
in these areas with what they feel are key emerging ques-
tions, conceptual issues, potential problems, and future
directions for research.
We plan for the workshop to be largely discussion-based,
but will include lectures and posters as a foundation for
discussion. The meeting will be a small-scale, intensive
workshop where all participants are encouraged to take
an active role, with particular emphasis on the inclusion
of early-career researchers. The venue will be an organic
farm/eco-retreat near the city of Bern.
Invited speakers include:
Jason Wolf University of Bath
Marta Soares CIBIO
Anna Lindholm University of Zurich

Deadline
Evolution of Mechanisms, January 28-31, 2016, Univer-
sity of Debrecen, Hungary
Please be reminded that the registration deadline for
our symposium \The evolution of mechanisms: a work-
shop on the integration of life history evolution and
physiology" is January 03, 2016.
Symposium summary:
In the past decades research in behavior and life his-
tory has been dominated by two dierent approaches:
molecular biologists and physiologists investigated the
ne-scaled mechanisms of how life history and behavioral
processes are regulated, while theoretical and organismal
biology provided an explanation for the adaptive value of
such traits and the evolutionary forces that shape them.
While both approaches have been extremely success-
ful, the proximate-ultimate dichotomy is not warranted
anymore: our next challenge is to integrate these ap-
proaches and to understand the evolution of the genetic,
endocrine mechanisms and signaling pathways that ulti-
mately lead to a bewildering diversity of life-forms.
In order to advance the discussion between these tradi-
tionally distinct areas, we organize a workshop where
we invite theoreticians and empiricists working in theelds of physiology, molecular biology and evolutionary
ecology to discuss the current state of the art and to
articulate a research agenda for the future, where they
identify the key challenges and approaches to study the
evolution of the integrated phenotype and physiological
underpinnings of life history evolution. Instead of the
dominantly unidirectional information ow of conference
symposia, we organize this meeting to promote discus-
sion and debate about ideas, concepts of how we can
understand the evolution of mechanisms that provide
the raw material for natural selection.
Participants are invited to give contributed talks that
advance the goal of the meeting. Additional poster
presentations will also be welcome.
Invited speakers:
Thomas Flatt (University of Lausanne): The mecha-
nisms underpinning life history evolution
David Gems (UCL): Role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in
the evolution of life histories and ageing
Laura Lavine (Washington State University): Endocrine
signaling and the development of the weapons of sexual
selection: insights from beetles
Pat Monaghan (University of Glasgow): Environmental
eects that shape individual life histories: mechanisms,
trade-os and time scales

BangorU PollenMetabarcoding
3.5 year, NERC ENVISION Doctoral Training Program
PhD Studentship ( ^A$14,057pa) - Pollen forecast 2020:
using DNA metabarcoding to assess aerial pollen mix-
tures and identify linkages to hay fever (Lead supervisor:
Simon Creer).
The School of Biological Sciences is currently advertising
for PhD opportunities to be hosted in the Molecular
Ecology & Fisheries Genetics Laboratory (MEFGL),
at Bangor University (http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/) to
commence in September 2016. The PhDs are part of
the NERC ENVISION Doctoral Training Programme
(http://www.envision-dtp.org/), a PhD consortium part-
nership between Bangor, Nottingham and Lancaster
Universities, alongside numerous environmental bodies,
aimed at equipping the next generation of Environmen-
tal Biologists with advanced skills.Project rationale: Approximately 20% of people dis-
play allergic reactions to combinations of tree and grass
pollen causing symptoms ranging from discomfort (e.g.
hay fever) to respiratory complications (e.g. asthma),
with associated costs to society and health services.
Identifying pollen from dierent species of tree can be
achieved using labour-intensive microscopy. Neverthe-
less, since most grass pollens look the same, an out-
standing challenge is to understand which species of
grass contribute to the allergic response. Aims: This
studentship has three components. The rst aims to
use dierent combinations of molecular genetic tools to
see how eectively we can assess aerial tree pollen mix-
tures. Secondly, to use modelling approaches to compare
and contrast the aerial transit of tree and grass pollens
and nally, to use a molecular ecology/environmental
epidemiology approach to identify which species of
grass pollen are most closely associated with hay fever
symptons. The PhD will form a distinct, but highly
complementary component within a larger ^A$1.2M
NERC funded study (now recruiting PDRA http://-10 EvolDir January 1, 2016
mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/news/3\25077) and provides an op-
portunity to work with an interdisciplinary team of
molecular ecologists, aerobiological modellers and envi-
ronmental epidemiologists from a range of UK Univer-
sities and the UK Met Oce. Co-supervision will be
provided by Natasha DeVere, Gareth Grith (Aberyst-
wyth), Carsten Skj ~Ath (Worcester) and Nick Osborne
(Exeter/Sydney).
Training will be provided in the main areas of molecular
ecology, genomics, taxonomy, bioinformatics, modelling;
multidisciplinarity skills; science communication and
environmental epidemiology complemented by a host of
additional opportunities for postgraduate development.
Fieldwork will occur within the UK, with opportunities
for travel/collaborations in Europe and Australia.
Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Hon-
ours Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in sub-
jects such as Environmental or Natural Sciences,
with a strong motivation to study biodiversity-
environment interactions. The ENVISION link is

DurhamU EvolutionaryEcology
A competitive four year PhD studentship opportunity
in evolutionary and ecological genetics is available at
Durham University, UK.
Title: The tness consequences of inbreeding in wild
ax.
Supervisory team: Dr Adrian Brennan, Durham Univer-
sity, UK, with the co-supervision of Prof Rus Hoelzel,
Durham University, UK, and Dr Kirsten Wol, Newcas-
tle University, UK.
Project description: This project aims to improve our
understanding of inbreeding and its relationship with
tness, a fundamental aspect of evolution. We will use
wild ax as a model to study this important relation-
ship, thereby raising the possibility of rapidly translating
results into sustainably enhancing agricultural produc-
tion via genetic improvement of crops. Our research
in wild ax will allow for the comparison of natural
populations exhibiting dierent levels of selng, thereby
revealing the extent to which natural selng leads to
purging and the development of a genome more resistant
to inbreeding depression. We will use new genotyping
by sequencing technologies to obtain an unprecedented
genome-wide perspective on inbreeding and its evolu-
tion, allowing the identication of relevant genes, and
therefore the consideration of molecular mechanisms. In-
breeding is widely understood to reduce tness through
both the expression of recessive deleterious alleles in
homozygotes, and through over-dominant allelic inter-
actions. Even naturally highly inbreeding organisms
cannot completely purge their genetic load by selection
because of faster drift at reduced eective population
size. For many crops, including ax, elite lines have
been intensively inbred to optimize the stable expression
of desirable traits. However, these same lines then suer
inbreeding depression. Studies of ax have found up
to 91 % heterotic increases in F1 seed yield following
controlled crosses. However, the agronomic potential of
heterosis has only been fully realized in hybrid varieties14 EvolDir January 1, 2016
of maize so far. Only recently have genotyping tech-
nologies advanced to a stage where it is possible to test
the long-held hypothesis that heterozygosity positively
correlates with tness using genome-wide data for many
individuals of non-model organisms. Initial results are
encouraging but more research is needed in organisms
showing a wider range of mating systems and population
structures to better understand the tness consequences
and genetic basis of inbreeding. The student will be
trained in next generation sequencing technologies, and
integrate studies of wild and glass-house populations to
test key hypotheses about inbreeding and tness.
Eligibility and Funding: For a UK-based applicant who
is successful in competition with other PhD projects,
the studentship will provide tuition fees, research funds
and a maintenance allowance. A successful European
economic area applicant will be provided tuition fees
and research funds only.
Application details: If interested in applying, please
contact Dr Adrian Brennan, a.c.brennan@durham.ac.uk

applications is 29th January 2016.

PhD position: Modeling ecology/evolution of a plant
pathogen, ETH Zurich
***The project***
will explore population dynamics of Zymoseptoria trit-
ici, an important fungal pathogen of wheat, using eco-
evolutionary modeling and eld/lab experimentation.
Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agricul-
ture. Current chemical and genetic technologies used to
manage plant diseases are highly vulnerable to pathogen
evolution and are not sustainable. Pathogen evolution
is facilitated by the genetic uniformity underlying mod-
ern agroecosystems. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop new, ecient and sustainable ways to control
plant diseases.
This PhD project intends to make an important con-
tribution towards achieving this goal. The rst phase
aims at comprehensive characterization of both epidemic
and evolutionary factors of the pathogen by combining
eco-evolutionary modeling, eld/lab experiments and
genome sequence analyses. In the second phase the
models will be used to predict the rate of pathogen adap-
tation to disease control and propose optimal spatio-
temporal patterns for applications of fungicides and
resistant host varieties that can disrupt pathogen adap-
tation.
***Working conditions***
Plant Pathology group at the Institute of Integra-
tive Biology, ETH Zurich oers a creative, collabo-
rative research environment and excellent infrastruc-
ture (www.path.ethz.ch). Salary is approximately 48000
Swiss francs per year. Zurich is a vibrant, international
and green city.
The PhD project is funded for three years by the Am-
bizione grant from the Swiss National Foundation with
a possibility of extension for the fourth year.
Unique training in mathematical modeling, bioinformat-
ics and eld/lab experiments increases chances to nd
a job in academia, industry or governmental agencies.
***Requirements***
|Master's/diploma in a quantitative discipline (e.g.
physics, mathematics or computer science), biology oragricultural/environmental sciences.
|Strong interest in mathematical/computational model-
ing in population biology
|Desire to link the models with real-world eld experi-
ments and spend about 40% of time doing experimental
work
|Excellent communication skills in English
|Programming skills, experience in mathematical mod-
eling or bioinformatics are important, but optional plus

MEME is a two-year research oriented master program
for talented and motivated students who are interested
in understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and16 EvolDir January 1, 2016

The Group \Ecology and Evolution of Molecular
Parasite-Host Interactions" of Juniorprofessor Emanuel
Heitlinger at the Humboldt University and the Leibniz
Institute for Zoo and Wildlife research, Berlin, Germany,
invites applications for a:
PhD position in population genomics of parasite-host
interaction
The position is oered for 3 years at the German 65%
TV-L E13 pay scale.
Research topic: We are establishing the house mouse
hybrid zone (HMHZ) close to Berlin as a system to study
host-parasite interactions. In the HMHZ two subspecies
of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus and Musmusculus musculus) meet and hybridize. We investigate
parasite specialization vs. generalism and recombina-
tion between strains of unicellular parasites of the genus
Eimeria. Eimeria spp. occur at high prevalence (around
30%) and dier in specicity for the mouse subspecies.
Requirements/Qualication of the PhD student: - Excel-
lent degree (Master or equivalent) in (molecular) evolu-
tionary biology or computational biology/bioinformatics
- Good communication skills in English - Some back-
ground in statistics and data analysis is required. -
Experience in programming (R/Perl/Python/C) is an
advantage, interest in it is required. - Experience in
genomics applications and next-generation sequencing
analysis is an advantage. - Background in evolutionary
theory and population genetics is an advantage.
The Heitlinger group works on ecology and evolution
of parasite-host interactions using tools from genomics
and transcriptomics. The PhD candidate will focus on
genome evolution of Eimeria spp. in two closely related
subspecies of the house mouse. Phenotypic aspects (im-
munology) of the same host individuals are investigated
in an ongoing project of another PhD student. A third
PhD project in the Heitlinger group is focused on gene
expression of both host and parsitized cells. The candi-
date is expected to closely collaborate with both PhD
students working on these ongoing projects and will be
directly supervised by Emanuel Heitlinger on genomics
data analysis.
The Heitlinger group provides a multidisciplinary work-
ing environment. Methods range from eld studies,
experiments \at the bench" to computational analyses.
The group is located at the Department of Molecular
Parasitology of the Humboldt University and has access
to laboratories and resources at the Leibniz Institute for
Zoo and wildlife research. This provides a diverse work-
ing environment allowing interaction with researchers
working on topics ranging from conservation ecology to
genetic manipulation of parasite biochemical pathways.
The student has the opportunity to apply for an asso-
ciation with the structured graduate training program

Project description
Project title: Role of parasitic chytrids in regulating
cyanobacterial blooms
Project description: Parasitic fungi of the order Chytridi-
ales (i.e. Chytrids) are able to infect a wide number
of phytoplankton species. Although overlooked for a
long time, chytrids are an important factor driving the
dynamics of phytoplankton. For example, Chytrids
seem to be involved in the decline of toxic cyanobacteria
blooms, by inducing direct mortality of parasitized cells
and indirectly by the mechanistic fragmentation which
weakens the resistance to grazing. On the other hand,
selection on host populations exerted by Chytrids is
also thought to be responsible for maintaining high host
diversity in nature. The candidate will use a novel host-
parasite system (based on a cyanobacterial host and its
chytrid parasite) for advancing in the eld of parasitism
in phytoplankton. The scope of the project will address
dierent questions related to the physiology, molecu-
lar genetics and genomics (including next-generation-
sequencing) of the interactions and their ecological and
evolutionary implications.
Language requirements: excellent English skills (uent
conversation and good writing skills)
Academic requirements: Master degree in biology or
bioinformatics. Solid background in ecology, evolution
and/or molecular biology.
Information of research group leader: We are a group
of evolutionary ecologists who study how rapid evolu-
tionary changes are being inuenced by environmentalchallenges. We have a long-standing experience working
with the Cladoceran model system: Daphnia and its mi-
croparasites. Recently, we also employ a Cyanobacteria-
Chytrid system to explore a number of ecological and
evolutionary questions.

On: Trans-generational tness consequences of chronic
stress induced by global change
Supervisors: Dr Julia Schroeder (Imperial College Lon-
don) and Prof Terry Burke (University of Sheeld)
Application deadline: 10 January 2016.
Project description: Human-induced global changes im-
pose chronic environmental stress on ever more natural
populations. The physiological symptoms of chronic
stress are changes in hormone levels that can lead to
stunted growth and increased risk of infection. Further-
more, the physiological mechanisms invoked by stressed
are similar to those in ageing individuals. Recent studies
suggest that chronic stress can lead to faster senescence
(measured in telomere shortening rates), not only in af-
fected individuals but also in their ospring. What are
the trans-generational tness consequences of a chronic
stress response, and how is it adaptive? Stress could
'prime' ospring to enable them to endure stressful con-
ditions in the future, by a 'life-fast die-young' trade-o.
This projects tests the hypothesis that chronic stress
primes the next generation. To test this, we make op-
portunistic use of an exceptionally well suited long-term
'natural experiment' in wild passerines and supplement
statistical analyses on existing long-term data with fo-January 1, 2016 EvolDir 19
cused experiments on captive birds.
The aim of this study is to quantify the tness conse-
quences of chronic stress to gain a better understanding
of the long-term tness costs and benets of chronic
stress in a wild population the consequences for popula-
tion viability. The student will utilise a unique long-term
study of a wild passerine population. The precise direc-
tion and emphasis of the project will be determined by
collaboration between the student and the supervisors.
Next to the traditional academic skills, the student will
also learn and improve key skills such as state-of-the-art
statistical modelling, data management, experimental
design and eld work. The student can expect to re-
ceive exceptional training in state-of-the-art analytical
methodology, as well as benetting from a well estab-
lished and rewarding eld project.

PhD Studentship (to start October 2016)
Assessing ecosystems diversity and function using envi-

Supervision: Professor Vincent Savolainen, Imperial

tion Thomson Ecology (Thomson Ecology are leading
Ecological Consultants, which expertise is in all ecosys-

Funded by NERC's Doctoral Training Programme 'Sci-
ence and Solutions for a Changing Planet'
Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been used predomi-
nantly in conservation biology for monitoring the ab-
sence/presence of one particular individual focal species
of conservation concern (e.g. the great crested newt).
However, the methodology has the potential to revolu-
tionise the entire eld of ecosystem assessment.
eDNA is being advocated increasingly in this role, as, in
theory, it simply requires a sample of water or soil to be
sequenced to give a comprehensive picture of the species
which are present, levels of abundance, an ecosystem's
biodiversity and, by extension, ecosystem functioning
and services. It has the potential to supersede current
biomonitoring approaches, although there are several
knowledge gaps for this approach. Here, we propose to
resolve some of the issues. Specically the PhD thesis
will comprise four main parts:
(i) Using focal species of interest for biomonitoring in
the UK, such as craysh, water vole and otter, the
student will rstly investigate the applicability of the
eDNA technique for determining absence/presence of
these species. The student will develop a standard sam-
pling protocol for the reliable detection of the chosen
species.
(ii) For the same species, the student will model how
eDNA detection correlates with animal density. Prelimi-
nary work in Savolainen lab demonstrated that detection
of craysh eDNA from lotic environments was feasible,
albeit only from high density populations. Savolainen
also found that craysh and newt densities also cor-
related signicantly with their eDNA concentrations
under controlled settings. These ndings will be tested20 EvolDir January 1, 2016
using more sensitive techniques that qPCR (e.g. droplet
digital PCR). The objective here will be to determine
whether the eDNA technique can usefully be employed
to indicate relative abundance from site to site or year
to year.
(iii) It is unclear how the use of the eDNA technique com-
pares to traditional biomonitoring techniques that are
in widespread use. Therefore, the student will compare
the performance of eDNA over traditional bioassess-
ment metrics in freshwater, marine and/or terrestrial
ecosystems. The study will make use of traditional
assessments undertaken by CASE partner Thomson
Ecology in these ecosystems, with the same samples be-
ing tested using eDNA-derived metrics (concentrations,
phylogeny-based, etc). The objective here will be to
determine whether the eDNA is as eective a technique
as conventional methods.
(iv) In support of (iii) above, testing of traditional vs
eDNA techniques will also be done in experimental, con-
trolled conditions e.g. in large glasshouses or water-lled
tanks. The aim will be to calibrate species diversity
estimates. This work has the potential to revisit current
estimates of species diversity, while providing new tools
for monitoring function or biodiversity more eciently
than has ever been performed in the past.
It is expected that the student will published the results
of the PhD in high-prole scientic journals

Masters + PhD Studentship (October 2016 start)
Evolution of species under environmental stress: ecolog-
ical genomics in island palms
Building on our decade-long evolutionary research on
Lord Howe Island (LHI, pictured), the student will use
this emerging model system to disentangle the genomic
underpinning of stress tolerance in plants. Uniquely,
we have identied a pair of closely related palm species
that have evolved on the minute LHI by adapting to
dierent soil types. One of the species, Howea forsteri-
ana, evolved on calcareous soils deposited by the sea one
million year ago, which lead to water, salt and metal
stresses whilst aecting owering phenologies. The stu-
dent will look at the underlying genomics of the species
split. S/he will attempt to validate candidate genes by
(i) rescuing wild-type phenotypes in Arabidopsis mu-
tants by introducing orthologous palm genes; and (ii)
attempting to transfer Howea genes into oil palms, the
latter having a generation time much more tractable for
such functional conrmation experiments. This research
is highly interdiscipliary and will help identify genes of
interest for agriculture (oil palm, coconuts, crops) and
horticulture, thereby contributing to ensure food secu-
rity under global change. The student will start with a
1-year MRes followed by 3-year PhD at the Silwood Park
Campus (Savolainen Lab, in collaboration with Dr Colin
Turnbull), combining genomics, statistics, eldwork and
greenhouse experiments.
The studentship is funded by BBSRC's doctoral training

The mechanisms and evolution of social inuence
Jordan Lab
The production, perception, and cognitive processing
of social cues can have far reaching eects on the so-
cial structure and behaviour of individuals within ani-
mal groups. Studying how the nature, frequency, and
ne-scale detail of these interactions leads to emergent
properties at the level of the collective is essential for
understanding social and collective behaviour generally.
An aspect of social interaction that is commonly over-
looked in studies of collective systems is that interacting
nodes within social networks are not of equal status - a
hierarchy exists that aects the nature and frequency
of interactions among individuals, and ultimately the
inuence an individual will have in its social network.
This hierarchy may be based on size, sex, familiarity, or
reputation, and has the potential to inuence numerous
aspects of sociality and collective behaviour.
In this project, we seek to understand how relationships
among group members can mediate the ow of informa-
tion within natural groups of either Lake Tanganyikan
cichlid sh or colonial spiders in Central America. We
aim to characterise social inuence at numerous levels
- from behavioural interactions in the lab to studies of
massive populations in the eld, examining the neuro-
biological basis of social inuence and socio-cognitive
abilities that facilitate social interactions.
We seek students who wish to employ multidisciplinary
approaches to explore their own research questions
around this central theme. In our department, students
have access to cutting edge digital tracking of animal
behaviour and leading molecular techniques, which can
be combined with in-depth lab and eld experiments
examining the adaptive signicance and mechanisms of
social inuence.
Collective Animal Behaviour
Couzin Lab
Abstract Understanding collective action in biological
processes is a central challenge, essential for achieving
progress in a variety of elds including the coordinated
communication among cells, or animals, to the dynamics
of information exchange among sophisticated organisms,
and the emergence of complex societies. ConsequentlyJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 25
the study of collective behaviour naturally spans scales,
from how neural circuits control individual behaviour
in a social context, to the analogous issue of determin-
ing the structure and function of the communication
network among organisms that gives rise to emergent
group, and population-level, behaviour.
We seek multiple PhD candidates to join our highly in-
ternational, collaborative and interdisciplinary research
group to investigating the behaviour and evolution of
collective animal behaviour in the lab and/or eld. We
are interested in both invertebrates (e.g. locusts) and
vertebrates (e.g. sh, birds) and those applicants who
wish to apply and/or develop modern technologies (e.g.
in automated tracking, virtual reality, GPS, drone-based
imaging, machine learning, neurobiology, genetics, com-
putational modelling) to understand how animals sense
their world and make decisions in the face of uncertainty
and risk.
Given the broad nature of this search it will be extremely
helpful if applicants can clearly state what excites them
about collective animal behaviour, and what they may
want to work on. Our positions are fully funded for 4
years to allow students time to develop their own ideas
and to follow ambitious and creative research directions.
Collective behaviours and social structure in animal
populations
Farine Lab
How do collective behaviours and social structure emerge
in animal populations? Seemingly simple mechanisms
can often be amplied to produce remarkable group-
level behaviours or population-level patterns. For exam-
ple, highly cohesive collective movement patterns can
emerge when animals respond to the movement cues
of nearby neighbours. Similarly, groups of animals can
solve complex problems, such as sensing their environ-
ment or nding cryptic new food sources, by eavesdrop-
ping on information being generated by nearby individ-
uals. While natural selection acts on the behavioural
phenotypes of (often selsh) individuals, collective be-
haviours are a group-level, or sometimes population-
level, property that themselves can shape selection, and
therefore form part of a complex evolutionary process.
To understand how collective behaviours evolve or so-
cial structure emerges, one must understand (1) the
mapping between individual phenotypes and collective
behaviour, (2) the link between collective behaviour, the
environment (both social and physical), and individual
tness, and (3) how selection arising from ecological or
social conditions drives the expression of the phenotypes
that are linked with collective behaviour or particular
decisions that lead to consistent social structure.We are seeking one or more PhD students to join an ex-
citing new group investigating the ecology and evolution
of social and collective animal

vated Ph.D. student to work on a NSF-funded projectexamining the role of natural selection in the evolution
of novel duplicate gene functions.
The project involves developing and applying compu-
tational and statistical approaches for examining the
types and strengths of natural selection acting on du-
plicate gene functions. In particular, the project will
incorporate sequence-based analyses and mathematical
modeling of gene expression evolution. The major ob-
jective of this project will be to elucidate the role of
natural selection in the functional evolution of duplicate
genes, and to study dierences in selective forces act-
ing on duplicates in populations of dierent sizes, over
evolutionary time, and with varying levels of functional
divergence.
Note that our lab is solely computational. While prior
knowledge of a programming language is not necessary,
candidates should have strong quantitative skills and
the drive to learn how to program.
If you are interested in joining the lab, please email
Raquel Assis ( rassis@psu.edu) a current CV and de-
scription of your research interests.
In addition, candidates must submit a formal
application to one of the following three Ph.D.
programs: Biology ( http://bio.psu.edu/graduate-
portal/join-our-program), Bioinformatics and Ge-
nomics ( http://www.huck.psu.edu/education/-

SamNobleMuseum UOklahoma
Ornithology
Potential PhD positions in in avian genomics, Sam Noble
Oklahoma Museum of Natural History and Department
of Biology, University of Oklahoma Matthew J. Miller
(http://mj-miller.net)
I anticipate adding 2V3 PhD students to my lab over
the next 21 months. I am particularly interested in
recruiting 1-2 students for all 2016. Students should
be willing to take a creative leadership role in one of
three principal research areas in our group: i) compar-
ative genomics of secondary contact in Mesoamerican
lowland birds, ii) comparative genomics of hybridization
in Great Plains birds, or the iii) ecology of emerging
vector-borne diseases in Panama.
A student working on secondary contact in Mesoameri-
can birds should expect to spend considerable time dur-
ing the rst two years of the project leading collecting
expeditions in multiple locations in Mexico and Central
America in collaboration with local and regional part-
ners. Thus, the ideal student will have previous Latin
American ornithological eld experience collecting mu-
seum voucher specimens, as well as the ability to under-
stand and speak Spanish. Students from Latin America
are particularly welcome. However, all potential stu-
dents with strong eld, lab, or collections ornithological
skills are encouraged to contact me. This student will
ultimately perform comparative genomic analyses using
datasets that she/he developed using massively-parallel
sequencing resources at the University of Oklahoma, so
NGS experience is a plus.
A student working on the hybridization in Great Plains
birds should be motivated to lead collecting expeditions
in Oklahoma and adjacent states, and should have famil-
iarity with population genomics theory and NGS library
techniques (or be able to demonstrate an aptitude for
learning these skills). This student will combine dis-
tributional records and genomic data from historical
and contemporary museum specimens to illuminate how
hybrid zones and bird distributional dynamics in the
face of climate change.
Pending NIH and collaborator funding, opportunities
to work on the ecological dynamics of vector-borne dis-
eases in Panama may also exist in our lab. A stu-
dent joining our group in disease ecology will be ex-pected to work closely with Panamanian collabora-
tors (especially Dr. Jose Loaiza, INDICASAT-AIP,
https://www.researchgate.net/prole/Jose Loaiza), on
mosquito and vertebrate interactions. Specic research
projects will be guided by secured and pending funding,
but typically will involve a combination of mosquito
genomics, screening bird blood for viral presence, and
modeling invertebrate and vertebrate dynamics across
a landscape land-use gradient.
My research group is based in the bird collection of
the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.
SNOMNH (http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/collections-
and-research/ornithology) is a world-class university
natural history museum; as such, students should be
motivated to participate in collection growth and cu-
ration as part of their research program. The mu-
seum has a modern genetic laboratory shared with Dr.
Cameron Siler (http://cameronsiler.com), SNOMNH
Curator of Herpetology. Genomic library prepa-
ration, sequencing, and data analysis will be con-
ducted in the under-construction genomics core lab at
the on-campus Stephenson Research Center (http://-
srtc.ou.edu/index.php). Resources in this lab will in-
clude Illumina Mi-Seq and Hi-Seq platforms, as well as
supercomputing resources for analytics.
The SNOMNH and the University of Oklahoma have
exceptional resources for ornithology students. Ad-
ditional faculty with ornithological expertise include
Eli Bridge (http://faculty-sta.ou.edu/B/Eli.S.Bridge-
1), Je Kelly (http://www.animalmigration.org), and
Michael Patten (http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/patten/-
Patten%20CV.pdf). Additional research opportunities
are available in collaboration with the Sutton Avian
Research Center (http://www.suttoncenter.org). Also,
the biology department is making a strategic commit-
ment to Geographical Ecology (http://ge.ou.edu), which
would encompass our groups research interests, and will
provide world-class collaborative resources in ecological
modeling of species distributions and interactions.
Graduate students in my group receive degrees in either
Biology or the EEB program which is aliated with
the Biology department. Students are supported by
Teaching Assistantships with a base salary of 17,000

StellenboschU LizardAdaptation
A PhD studentship is available in the Botany and Zool-
ogy department at Stellenbosch University in the West-
ern Cape of South Africa. The project is funded by
the South African National Research Foundation and
focuses on the evolutionary responses of lizards to cli-
mate change. The student will be supervised by Su-
sana Clusella-Trullas (Stellenbosch University), Michael
Logan (Stellenbosch University), and Jerey Streicher
(Natural History Museum, London).
Global climate is changing rapidly and the degree to
which natural populations respond to temperature vari-
ation is essential for predicting the impacts of climate
change on biodiversity. Individuals can adjust to tem-
perature variation through behaviour, acclimation re-
sponses and/or evolutionary mechanisms. While much
work has focused on behavioural compensation and plas-
tic responses, less emphasis has been placed on evolu-
tionary adaptation. Furthermore, the links between be-
haviour and evolutionary adaptation have rarely been ad-
dressed, although theory predicts that behaviour could
either inhibit or promote evolutionary processes. This
project will combine physiological ecology and genetics
to examine the evolutionary paths by which populations
adapt to climate variability. This project should gen-
erate a powerful predictive framework for how climate
change drives evolutionary adaptation, and how this is
mediated by behaviour in terrestrial ectotherms.
In addition to collecting measurements of locomotor
performance and metabolic rates in the lab, the student
will conduct an ethological eld study. Further, the
student will travel to the Natural History Museum in
London to receive training in high-throughput DNA
sequencing techniques. Ideal applicants will have an
exemplary academic record and prior research experi-
ence. All project running costs have been secured and
successful candidates will receive a bursary for 3 years
starting in 2016. For more information, or to apply,
please send a CV and academic transcripts to Susana
Clusella-Trullas: sct333@sun.ac.za. Review of applica-
tions will begin from the 20th of January 2016 onwards

WheatComparativeGenomics
Dear Evoldir'ers
Last chance to apply for this comparative genomics PhD
focussing on alternative splicing in hexaploid wheat.
http://www.tgac.ac.uk/studentships/dtp-studentships/-
revealing-the-alternative-splicing-landscape-of-wheat-
through-comparative-transcriptomics/ Alternative
splicing (AS) is a mechanism that enables multiple
distinct mRNAs to be formed from a single gene.
Recent studies suggest that over 60 per cent of intron-
containing genes in plants undergo AS, generating a
vast repertoire of transcript isoforms.
While the importance of AS in contributing to protein
diversity in plant and animal genomes is now well es-
tablished few studies have examined AS in polyploid
species. Polyploidy is the possession of more than two
complete sets of chromosomes and is especially com-
mon in plants. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an
allohexaploid (AABBDD) with the three subgenomes
A, B and D derived from three diploid species within
tribe Triticeae. Dierential regulation of AS between
the subgenomes may allow more regulatory exibility in
duplicated genes, AS has therefore potentially played an
important role in the evolution and adaptation of culti-
vated crops to dierent environmental conditions and
niches. This proposal aims to investigate the immediate
and long-term eects of polyploidy on AS, examine the
importance of AS in the evolution of duplicated genes
and its potential role in domestication.
The successful student will apply the latest computa-
tional approaches and sequencing technologies to iden-
tify how much variation in AS exists in synthetic wheat
hybrid lines and between wheat and its progenitor
species. This will provide for the rst time a detailed
view of the role AS has played in the evolution and adap-
tation of wheat and its relationship to hybridisation and
polyploidy. The student will have access to a high-
performance computing environment and the opportu-
nity to learn about gene regulation, transcriptomics,
genome analysis, transcript assembly, bioinformatics
and software development.

MathematicalPhylogenetics
A PhD Scholarship in Mathematical Phylogenetics is
available at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
Background. Inferring the evolutionary history of all
life on Earth has long been a fascinating problem in
biology. Traditionally, evolutionary (phylogenetic) trees
are used to represent ancestral relationships between or-
ganisms. However, recent investigations into horizontal
gene transfer and hybridization, which are processes that
result in mosaic patterns of relationships, challenge the
model of a phylogenetic tree. Indeed, it is now widely ac-
knowledged that graphs with cycles, called phylogenetic
networks, are better suited to represent evolutionaryhistories. Phylogenetic networks pose many interesting
mathematical challenges and have become a vivid area
of research since the beginning of the 21st century.
Project. This PhD project is an exciting opportunity
to develop combinatorial and algorithmic approaches
to analyze and reconstruct phylogenetic networks. For
example, a better understanding of the mathematics
that underlies the space of all phylogenetic networks is
fundamental to the reconstruction of phylogenetic net-
works from biological data. In short, the PhD project
aims at the development of new mathematical tools and
algorithms to analyze and search spaces of phylogenetic
networks.
Requirements. The successful applicant has a Mas-
ters or Honours degree in mathematics or computer
science and, preferably, a strong background in graph
theory and/or theoretical computer science. An interest
in biological questions is desirable, but not a require-
ment. Candidates must also be eligible for admission
to the PhD program at the University of Auckland.
For more information on postgraduate studies at the
University of Auckland, see the following link: https://-
www.auckland.ac.nz/en/for/future-postgraduates.html .
Scholarship. The PhD scholarship is funded by the New
Zealand Marsden Fund and available from March 2016.
A later starting date is negotiable. The scholarship is
for three years. It covers tuition fees and provides an
annual tax free allowance of NZ$27,500. The success-
ful candidate will be based within the Department of
Computer Science at the University of Auckland, New
Zealand, and supervised by Dr Simone Linz.
Application. To apply, please email your CV and aca-
demic transcript, a short statement of research interests,
and names and contact details of two referees to Simone
Linz (s.linz@auckland.ac.nz). Informal inquiries can
be directed to the same address. Applications will be
accepted until the position is lled.

Project description
Project background
The Pink Pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri) is an endangered
species native to Mauritius. The population has re-
covered from just 10 to ~400 birds today, but is still
threatened by introduced pathogens, predators and habi-
tat loss. This project will study the genetic structure
of the Pink Pigeon population, prior to and post, the
population bottleneck, to investigate the eect of popu-
lation decline on genomic diversity and its implications
for conservation.
Research methodology
The successful applicant will learn how to perform DNA
extractions on historical (1800's) Pink Pigeon skins and
NGS library preparation at the ancient DNA laboratory
at the Natural History Museum (London). Sequencing
will be carried out at TGAC followed by extensive qual-
ity control of reads and alignment to the Pink Pigeon
reference for variant discovery. Using these resources
the candidate will perform temporal population genetic
analyses: estimate eective population size prior to the
bottleneck; quantify the loss of genetic variation due
to the bottleneck; compare the loss of genetic variation
against those predicted by population genetic statistics;
estimate dierentiation between the modern and his-
toric populations; perform statistical tests to determine
whether allele loss was random during the population
decline or if the population underwent directional selec-
tion; infer historical population sizes prior to the 1800's
by using Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent
(PSMC analysis).
Training The successful candidate will work at the34 EvolDir January 1, 2016
Genome Analysis Centre in collaboration with the Uni-
versity of East Anglia and the Natural History Museum.
During this multidisciplinary project the student will
gain skills and experience in genetics, evolution, molecu-
lar biology and bioinformatics including statistical anal-
ysis. The student will also receive a broad training in
all aspects of science delivery and dissemination, as well
as in transferrable skills.
Personal specication
Essential: First or upper second-class degree or Mas-
ter's in a life or computational science discipline; A
self-motivated researcher with an interest in, and un-
derstanding of population genetic studies and evolution,
willing to develop their technical and analytical skills
with strong presentation and written communication
skills. Desirable: Experience with bioinformatics tools
and/or the ability to write scripts with Python, Perl or
similar programming languages.
Shortlisted applicants will be invited to an interview
day on the 17th or 18th February 2016.
Funding Successful candidates who meet RCUK's eli-
gibility criteria will be awarded a NERC studentship.
In most cases, UK and EU nationals who have been
resident in the UK for 3 years are eligible for a full
award. In 2015/16, the stipend was ~A^A$14,057.

data. Extant whole-genome data have given insights
into gene ow between groups and population struc-
ture, with population isolates showing high genetic drift(particularly in mountain gorillas), which has important
implications for conservation genetics. Pathogens such
as Ebola virus are decimating wild populations and im-
posing high selective loads that will lead to adaptation.
There is a clear need to better understand the structures
of wild populations in their existing environments.
The genetic diversity of wild populations is strongly
inuenced by mating patterns and sex-biased dispersal,
including the inuence of sperm competition. Analysis
of DNA variants in the male-specic region of the Y
chromosome (MSY) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
has contributed much to understanding these factors
in many mammalian species. Until recently, typing
of multiple short-tandem repeats (STRs) has been the
only practical way to assess MSY diversity in the great
apes. We have sequenced several megabases of MSY
DNA in great-ape males via next-generation sequencing
(NGS), deriving a detailed MSY phylogeny containing
thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
In our small zoo-based sample this distinguishes well
between (sub)species and reveals dramatic dierences
that hint at diverse sex-biased processes.
This project aims to expand the MSY tree by NGS
analysis of additional great-ape individuals, to properly
understand the STR/SNP haplogroup relationships, and
to develop methods to type MSY SNPs and STRs, as
well as mtDNA, in non-invasive samples such as faeces
and hair collected from wild populations. As well as
allowing a large-scale approach to gene ow, demogra-
phy and sex-biased processes in non-invasive samples
from natural environments, such methods will be also be
adapted for in-eld application for analysis of samples
connected to the bushmeat trade in order to combat
a major threat to wild ape populations, and to aid
conservation.
The project will envolve the initial establishment of
conventional methods for assessing diversity, including
building uorescent PCR multiplexes, analysis via cap-
illary electrophoresis, set-up of software for automatic
allele calling, PCR primer design, SNP typing, and
Sanger sequencing.
PCR-based and sequence capture (Agilent) approaches
will be established for next-generation (Illumina MiSeq)
and third-generation sequencing platforms (MinION;
Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Methods will be
adapted and validated for non-invasive samples from
the wild, and MinION methods established for in-eld
analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences and population-
genetic statistical analysis will be undertaken to illumi-
nate the population structures and evolution of great
ape (sub)species, to understand the roles of sex-biased36 EvolDir January 1, 2016

Project 1 \Control and conservation of endemic species
in the UK and Hawaii"
Dr. Angus Davison and Dr Sara Goodacre, School of
Life Sciences, University of Nottingham
Invasive snails and slugs are causing worldwide prob-
lems, both in terms of direct damage to crops, and as
intermediate vectors for diseases of farm animals. Yet,January 1, 2016 EvolDir 37
snails and slugs are dicult to identify and we have
little idea of what inuences their distributions, hinder-
ing appropriate control and conservation eorts. In the
UK, modern molecular phylogenetic knowledge of these
species - terrestrial and aquatic - and their potential as
vectors of disease is relatively limited. In Hawaii, we
have recently characterised an aquatic Lymnaeaid snail
that has cryptically colonised the archipelago. This
snail is endangering the local endemic species, and po-
tentially acts as an intermediate vector for the liver uke
parasite.
The aim of this project, therefore, will be to study
the process of invasion, using representative species in
the UK and Hawaii (with collaborators in the Bishop
Museum, Hawaii and Howard University) to under-
stand the evolution of these snails and their para-
sites, and including methods that may help rene
the identication of the invasive species and species
of conservation concern. Although much of the work
will be lab-based, with a concomitant bioinformatics
element, eld collection will be a necessary compo-
nent. https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/graduateschool/-

Project 2 \Extreme strength from biomineralisation in
molluscs"
Dr. Angus Davison, School of Life Sciences and Dr
Nicola Everitt, Faculty of Engineering, University of
Nottingham
Nature has inspired some of our greatest inventions,
from biomimetic Velcro to sea-water desalinating bio-
logical membranes. In this project, we will explore the
potential for biomimicry in the design features of mol-
luscs, focussing on their mastery of biomineralisation.
For instance, snail teeth are the strongest biological
material, and have outstanding mechanical properties,
due to their multi-layered structure; also, so-called \love
darts" are unique drug-enlaced delivery vehicles that
vary markedly between species, yet at present we are
quite ignorant of how the function of these organs relates
to their microstructure.
In this project, we will use nanoindentation methods to
investigate the mechanical behaviour of specimens at
a microstructural length scale. Simultaneously, we will
investigate the development of the organ(s), through
gene expression studies, also combining ecological and
phylogenetic information to construct an evolutionary
framework which links the microstructure to the me-
chanical properties. Ultimately, the project will seek
to use the information gained to inspire, inform and
improve the production of new technologies, perhaps
especially with regard to microparticle design, drug
delivery and nanocomposite materials, and will of neces-sity seek out of commercial partners, as discoveries are
made. https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/graduateschool/-

MacroEvolutionPaleobiology
GradStudentPositions:UPenn.MacroevolutionPaleobiology
A PhD fellowship in Paleobiology is available in the
Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the
University of Pennsylvania, starting in Fall 2016. Prof.
Lauren Sallan seeks a graduate student to address ma-
jor questions about the evolution of life. These include:
how global change has aected life over time, how life
evolves at high levels (macroevolution), the relation-
ships of living and dead animals (phylogeny), and the
origins of living biodiversity. While research in the lab
has focused on shes, any suitable group of fossils may
be used.
Potential thesis topics include, but are not limited to:
the long-term eects of mass extinctions (e.g. the end-
Devonian and end-Ordovician), the roles of predation
and competition in marine ecosystem evolution, traits
of adaptive radiations and living fossils, the eects of
long-term climate and environmental changes (e.g. the
Late Paleozoic Ice Age) on biodiversity, and major tran-
sitions in early vertebrate evolution (e.g. origin of jaws,
invasion of land). The student can also develop a novel
project that addresses similar questions using quantita-
tive, phylogenetic and/or descriptive methods.
Applicants are encouraged to contact Prof. Sallan (lsal-
lan@sas.upenn.edu) for more details. Additional infor-
mation on the fellowship is available on the departmen-

Evolution and development of shark skin teeth inspired
surface design for global CO2 reductionThe deadline for submission of applications is Monday
11th January 2016.
A Ph.D studentship is available for an interdisciplinary
project focused on evolutionary developmental biology
of shark skin teeth and engineering shark-inspired sur-
face geometries for reduced drag leading lower CO2
emissions across several industries. This is an ideal op-
portunity for an ambitious candidate to work at the
interface of evo-devo and engineering. This project aims
to explore novel methods to understand the evolution
and development of shark tooth patterning and how
these data can be modelled in silico for more energy
ecient surface design that can be 3D-printed for func-

The genomics of ecological speciation in an endemic
plant genus
This SPITFIRE project will analyse the speciation ge-
nomics of an endemic genus in the Canary Islands. Sev-
eral species are endemic to these islands, showing eco-
logical speciation (the origin of species by adaptation to
novel environments) within and between islands. The
genome of one species is being sequenced at UoS, and
the SPITFIRE project will generate sequencing data
from multiple individuals of all the endemic species plus
mainland congeners. First, phylogenetic analyses will
resolve the process of speciation throughout the Islands.
Second, the strength of intrinsic reproductive isolation
between species pairs will be measured through crossing
experiments in situ on Tenerife. Third, through the
analysis of linkage disequilibrium, DNA polymorphism
and selective sweeps, the genomic regions and candidate
genes underlying ecological speciation will be uncovered.

Vienna SymbioticSpeciation
PhD Position in Symbiotic Speciation, Genetics & Mi-
crobiology at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria
A PhD position funded by the Austrian Science Fund
(FWF) is available to study the impact of the endosym-
biotic bacteria Wolbachia on physiology, sexual behavior
and de novo speciation of the model system Drosophila.
This intracellular bacterium is well known as the prime
reproductive parasite of insects by causing cytoplasmic
incompatibilities, feminization, parthenogenesis or male
killing, but depending on their evolutionary stage, it
also can provide adaptive tness benets to insect hosts,
such as nutritional provisioning or pathogen protection.
We recently found that in some Drosophila species Wol-
bachia specically colonize dened host brain regions
that orchestrate sexual behavior of male and female ies.
Furthermore we found that even slight perturbations
of this intimate host-symbiont homeostasis can foster
de novo speciation of Drosophila in the wild plus under
experimental conditions in our laboratory.January 1, 2016 EvolDir 43
In this newly started FWF research project we aim
to decipher the temporal and functional dynamics of
this Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis in two dierent
Drosophila systems, which are currently under specia-
tion in the Neotropics.
The successful candidate will be embedded in the highly
multidisciplinary and collaborative environments at the
Department of Cell and Developmental Biology of the
Medical University of Vienna.
Applicants should hold a master's degree in biology,
genetics, microbiology, or a related discipline. We are
looking for enthusiastic scientists with procient com-
munication skills, who are good team players. Previous
experiences with DNA & RNA techniques, sequence
analyses, y work, FISH assays, immunocytochemistry
and/or microscopy techniques are advantageous.
Please send applications (including CV, a letter of intent
and contact information of at least two referees) to the
address below.

mal enquiries are welcome. Contact:Wolfgang Miller,

*Tenure-Track Position Announcements: Pollination
Cluster Hire* ** Bee Health ** Pollinator and Plant
Interaction Networks ** Evolutionary Ecology of Polli-
nation Mutualisms from the Plant Perspective **
The University of California, Riverside seeks outstand-
ing candidates for three faculty positions in various
aspects of pollinator and pollination biology to be lled
at the Assistant, Associate or Full Professor rank. This
cluster hire currently seeks collaborative biologists ex-
amining issues related to (1) bee health (Open rank),
(2) pollinator and plant interaction networks (Assistant
rank) and (3) evolutionary ecology of pollination mu-
tualisms from the plant perspective (Assistant rank).
The majority of crop systems and over a third of global
food production relies on animal pollination, and the
value added by managed pollination to US agricultural
production exceeds $20B per year. California is home
to many of these crops with intensive pollination needs,
and accounts for the majority of paid pollination con-
tracts in the US. Research funding for pollinator health
is available from a number of national research agencies,
and well as a variety of commodity boards. Recogni-
tion of the importance of funding research in pollinator
health and pollination services has been growing among
these agencies in reaction to colony collapse disorder
and declining wild bee populations. Maintaining agri-
cultural productivity and natural plant communities
will require enhanced knowledge of the pollination in-
teractions in these systems, and solutions to health and
management problems facing pollinators. These indi-
viduals will build on existing strengths in fundamental
and applied research in pollination biology and social
insects. Research to maintain agricultural productivity
and natural plant communities will require enhanced
knowledge of the pollination interactions in these sys-
tems, and solutions to health and management problems
facing pollinators.
The University of California at Riverside (UCR) is em-
barking on a major new hiring initiative that will add
300 tenure-track positions in 33 cross-disciplinary areas
selected through a peer-reviewed competition (cluster-
hiring@ucr.edu). Over the next three years, we will
hire multiple faculty members in each area and invest
in research infrastructure to support their work. Thisinitiative will build critical mass in vital and emerging
elds of scholarship, foster truly cross-disciplinary work
and further diversify the faculty at one of America ^As
most diverse research universities. We encourage ap-
plications from scholars committed to excellence and
seeking to help redene the research university for the
next generation.
The successful candidates will hold an academic ap-
pointment in a department selected during the recruit-
ment, with the option of a secondary cooperating faculty
appointment if appropriate. Depending upon the de-
partment of appointment, the position may include an
appointment in the Agricultural Experiment Station,
which includes the responsibility to conduct research
and outreach relevant to the mission of the California

Bootstrapping Trees
Hi,
I'm creating a tree from a distance matrix using phylip
neighbor and phylib drawgram. I would like to have
bootstrap values for the branches but all I have is this
one distance matrix. Is this possible?
The distance matrix is calculated from a Genotyping by
Sequencing (GBS) dataset with a few thousand SNPs.
For each individual pair, the distance is basically the
proportion of genotypes that dier for loci where both
individuals are genotyped.
I could easily create dierent distance matrices by ran-
domly sampling only some of the SNPs to calculate the
distances, but that would not make much sense. For
example, if I use a low proportion of the SNPs (ie: 5%),
the bootstrap values will end up being lower because
the matrices will be more dierent from one another
than if I use a high proportion of the SNPs (ie: 50+%).
It feels like I can control the bootstrap values articially,
so that is not a good avenue.
Is there a way, given a single distance matrix, to create
a tree with bootstrap values?
I'll be happy to summarize the answers and post them
back on EvolDir.

Hokkaido Japan VolResAssist
SeabirdEvolution
Behavioural Ecology of seabirds by using bio-logging
techniques.
Location: Teuri and Rishiri Islands, Hokkaido, Japan.
Duration: 3 months. Job Type: Volunteer.
We use bio-logging devices (e.g. geolocators, GPS
recorders) on two species (Rhinoceros Auklets and Black-
backed Gulls) to study behavioural ecology of colonial
seabirds. Most work will involve assisting a long-term
monitoring project and behavioural studies of post-doc
fellows and graduate students from Hokkaido Univer-
sity coordinated by Yutaka Watanuki, with the daily
monitoring breeding birds and their chicks, and the
deployment and retrieval of tracking devices. It will
also involve entering data collected in the eld into
databases.
We are looking for an enthusiastic, hardworking young
biologist to work as a voluntary Research Assistant to
help with our seabird research on Teuri/Rishiri Island,
Hokkaido, Japan, between May and July 2015. Previous
experience in the eld or in harsh conditions is desirable,
but not essential. Work on Teuri/Rishiri requires long
hours (with some work at night and at dawn) spent in
a cold and wet environment and considerable manual
work. A successful candidate should be able to work
independently and have a reasonable level of tness.
Planning to embark on further research degrees in the
future would be preferable. It is also important that the
assistant feels comfortable sharing sometimes crowded
accommodation with a number of colleagues over long
periods of time, and can cope with the occasional un-
tidiness inevitably associated with eldwork.
Unfortunately we cannot provide a stipend but accom-
modation (shared and basic) on Teuri/Rishiri will be
covered. However, the project is a great opportunity
to gain valuable experience in modern eld ornithology,
with bio-logging techniques. There will also be oppor-
tunities for the assistant to learn some analytical tech-
niques applied to animal movement data. Teuri/Rishiri
has mobile coverage and some access to Internet, how-
ever movements to and from the mainland are limited
because of unpredictable wind conditions. Teuri/Rishiri
is an inhabited island and there are small restaurants
and grocery stores. There is a small community ofother researchers, ringers and volunteers at our shared
accommodation.
If you are interested, please email a CV and a state-
ment of interest and arrange for two letters of ref-
erence to be emailed to akikosho@gmail.com (with
ywata@sh.hokudai.ac.jp in cc). The deadline for sub-
mitting applications (including reference letters) is the
31st January 2016. We will interview the shortlisted
candidates (on Skype) shortly after and we expect to
make a decision by late February.

faced the same problem with their species or subspecies
form or know a similar case where a widely distributed
species has several subspecies form and has not assessed
accordingly under IUCN.
I look forward to hear you. Thanking you.

IUCN subspeciesListing answers
*Subspecies diversication and its importance in conser-
vation*
Dear all,
This is in reference to the issue I raised last week whether
the subspecies should be considered as a conservation
unit for the assessment under IUCN Vred list. I empha-
sise this particularly for those species whose mulitple
forms (subspecies) exists and they have not accorded
separately instead lumped to a species complex under
IUCN.
The responses I received are overwhelming and some of
you were also experiencing the same problem that I am
facing here in India. I have seriously considered each of
your response/reply to compile my view point for the
species of my concern.
thanking you so much for writing, sharing your expe-
riences, views and suggesting me the possible way to

Get some population geneticists involved. We are just
starting to get a glimpse of what a genetic load is for
a population. My take is that all endangered species
should be classied and managed by sub species. The
evolutionary facts of life are that nearly all the sub
species are going to go extinct for one reason or another.
We are just getting data on what the genetic load is
for a population in terms mutations in the genome. It
may be that some populations will survive their genetic
load upon population reduction and most will not. The
more populations the better the chance that one will
survive. If you start mixing the populations articially
to increase current reproductive success you may be
dooming the species to extinction by just making all
the populations the same in terms of their chance at
ultimate survival.
Trying to maintain the largest eective population maybe the simplest to manage, but it may not be the best
solution in terms of ultimate survival of that lineage.
We only see the survivors in the current biosphere and
the survivors have been few and the failures have been
many.

Dear Mukesh,
Thank you very much for raising this very important
IUCN issue.
On a separate but related concern related to marine
shrimp populations in their natural range in the Pacic
coast of Latin America, I have not succeeded in encour-
aging IUCN leaders to take action to review the penaeus
taxon.
The natural populations of the Pacic whiteleg shrimp,
*Litopenaeus (Penaeus) vannamei,* from northern Peru
to northern Mexico, may be at risk. The unregulated
international trade threatens food safety, food security
and national security. There are no international author-
ities, or concerned veterinarians, in charge of addressing
the lack of supervision for the massive translocation of
a subspecies from one continent to another -without
quarantine!. Nobody seems to take responsibility for
this.
The severe *Vibrio* spp-causing disease (AHPND/EMS)
of fast growing SPF *L. vannamei *from US, which rst
appeared in China in 2009 and quickly spread to other
countries in Asia and then to Mexico in April 2013, is
of concern to conserve healthy biodiversity in light of
climate change.
My requests to international agencies and governments
to protect the natural populations of *L. vannamei*
have received no replies, not from IUCN, FAO, World
Bank, US authorities, or the authorities of the leading
shrimp producing-countries (Ecuador, India and Indone-
sia), that claim to be EMS-free (unconrmed - we are
checking into these claims).
My requests to AVMA leaders and US government's
health ocials in charge of protecting our food sup-
ply have gone nowhere. Nobody seems to care, in
spite of my repeated calls for action at meetings of
the World Aquaculture Society (https://www.was.org/-
meetingabstracts/ShowAbstract.aspx?Id=32080). A
group in France, supported by IUCN, is actually work-
ing on an industry-sponsored project to 'address the
safety and nutrition of current feeds used in shrimp
aquaculture'.
Can I do something to help you *bring together the
basic researchers on population genetics and the leaders70 EvolDir January 1, 2016
of IUCN?*, to address the issues of concern to both of
us?
Would you be interested in *organizing a Biodiversity
Conservation meeting, *to invite the IUCN leaders to
address our issues of concern?. Friends of the FUCOBI
Foundation of Ecuador, of which I was the Founder and
rst President, would be very happy to support an inter-
national meeting like this, *if *you include collaborators
from our 'ONE HEALTH Epigenomics Educational Ini-
tiative (OHEEI)' in India and Nigeria. Indeed, we just
sent a message out to a 'ONE HEALTH' list, oer-
ing travel awards to pay for expenses of speakers and
students to attend conservation meetings

KluaneYukon RedSquirrelVolunteers
SpringSummer2016
Field Assistants Required-North American red squirrels
Kluane, Yukon, Canada
We are looking for volunteers to assist with eldwork
for a number of dierent time periods: (a) 1 March-30
April/15-May (b) 1 May-15 July, and (c) 1 September-
15 October. We will also have two positions that extend
from 1 March to 15-Aug.
The positions are part of a long-term study of red squir-
rel ecology, evolutionary biology and physiology. As a
member of the study, assistants will be involved with
monitoring the reproduction and survival of individu-
als. Fieldwork will involve live-trapping and handling of
animals, radio-telemetry, behavioural observation, and
climbing trees to nd young in nests. Some positions
will also require handling for physiological assays (e.g.,
blood sampling) This is an excellent opportunity to gain
experience working with a collaborative research team
on a long-term study of a wild mammal.
All eldwork is carried against the beautiful backdrop
of southwestern Yukon, Canada. We will be staying at a
rustic eld station two hours from Whitehorse, and ~30
min to the nearest town (Haines Junction). Food and
accommodation are provided. Volunteers are required
to provide for their own travel to Edmonton, Alberta;however, travel from Edmonton to the eld station (and
back again!) is provided.
Training will be provided and no experience is necessary.
An on-site head technician will coordinate the project,
in coordination with the PIs. Candidates should have
an interest in a number of the following (the more the
better!): ecology, evolutionary biology, wildlife, eld bi-
ology, and animal behaviour. The eld camp is remote
and low tech (no showers, cell phone service, or internet),
so successful applicants must enjoy the outdoors and
be able to remain a positive and responsible team mem-
ber under relatively isolated and demanding conditions.
Candidates must be in good physical condition, be will-
ing to climb trees, and have an enthusiasm for learning.
We work on 'squirrel time', which often involves long
work days; as such, applicants must have a strong work
ethic. That said, the atmosphere at squirrel camp is
friendly and inclusive, and this area is one of the most
beautiful in Canada. All nationalities are welcome.
If you wish to apply for one of these posts then please
send a CV with a cover letter and contact details for
three references (with e-mail addresses), by email to

recording equipment. Experience with monitoring ani-
mals, especially birds, is desirable. Applicants should
also be highly motivated and well organised, with capa-
bilities of working both in a group and independently.
Work will be 5-6 days per week starting early in the
morning and potentially continuing into the evening.
The working language at the Institute is English, so
good knowledge of the language is required. A basic
working knowledge of the Spanish language would be
advantageous. Eligibility is sadly restricted to UK and
EU students. The Max Planck Institute for Ornithology
employs a dynamic, dedicated, and international group
of researchers who are focused on exploring the elds of

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
I just noticed that I have packed an outdated Nuc-
SubMat.BIN le (dated 2003) with DAMBE. This le
contains a collection of nucleotide score matrices for
sequence alignment in binary format. The new function
for phylogenetics with pairwise alignment uses a matrix
that is not in that le, resulting in wrong output for
nucleotide sequences (amino acid and codon sequence
alignment will be ne). I have uploaded a new version
with the correction.

Postdoctoral Fellow on robust and ecient dairy cows
Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG
<http://mbg.au.dk/forskning/forskningscentre/center-
for-quantitative-genetics-and-genomics/ >), at the De-
partment of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus
University, is seeking a creative, motivated and produc-
tive Postdoctoral Fellow to conduct research on dairy
cattle phenomics and genetics.
Project In dairy cattle breeding, denition and measure-
ment of new phenotypes like rumen microbial composi-
tion, feed intake, and methane emission, is important
in order to continuously improve the genetic potentialand management of the dairy cattle population and to
accommodate for new breeding goals. However, an im-
portant issue regarding many of these new phenotypes
is how to measure them in large scale in commercial
dairy cattle herds as they are dicult and expensive to
measure. Therefore, measurement techniques need to
be further developed and validated. In this post doc
project, the successful candidate will work on data col-
lection, analysis and validation of phenotypes related to
robustness and eciency on a large scale in commercial
farms and in our research farm. The project will be
very industry oriented, but have a high scientic focus
on novel phenotypes. The genetic evaluation of the new
phenotypes will give us insight in the underlying biol-
ogy of complex traits like feed eciency and methane
emission.
The position is open for 2 years with a possibility to
extend for another year and the expected starting date
is the 1st of March 2016.
Qualications and competences * PhD or equivalent
in quantitative genetics, statistical genetics, or related
elds * Documented experience in multivariate statis-
tics. * Preferably experience working with unix/linuxJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 75

at Bangor University. Closing date 1st Feb.
We are looking for a dynamic researcher to full a leading
role in a new Leverhulme Trust-funded project aimed at
developing a linkage map of the gerbil genome. Desert-
dwelling rodents have great potential to provide insight
into the genetic basis of physiological adaptation to
restricted diets and lack of water, and can inform un-
derstanding of human diseases such as diabetes. The
primary objective of this project is to develop a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based linkage map of
the gerbil genome to reveal gene order and provide a
scaold for data from whole genome sequencing eorts.
Duties will include maintenance and breeding of Mongo-
lian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus); RNA-Seq analysis
of multiple tissues and developmental stages; genera-
tion and development of SNP markers via genotyping
by sequencing (GBS); and the creation of high-density
genetic linkage maps.
Candidates should be educated to PhD standard (or
equivalent) and have previous experience in relevant
techniques, including the development of genetic mark-
ers and linkage analysis in plant or animal systems.
Familiarity with bioinformatic tools for analysis of RNA-
Seq experiments is desirable, but not essential.
The successful candidate will be expected to commence
1st April 2016 or as soon as possible thereafter.

We are looking for a dynamic postdoctoral researcher to
full a leading role in a multidisciplinary team working
at the interface between the molecular genetic anal-
ysis of aerial pollen composition and human health
(http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/news/3{25077). Approxi-
mately 20% of the UK population suer from summer
allergies and the primary outdoor allergens are grass
pollens. Nevertheless, there is currently no easy way of
discriminating dierent species of grass pollen using tra-

Collective Cognition in Animal Groups
We seek a postdoctoral scientist to explore experimen-
tally how perception, learning and strategic decision-
making enhance the capabilities of group-living animals.
Due to their diversity of cognitive capabilities and social
organisation, and their suitability for both laboratory
and eld studies, this study will focus on sh, which
oer a powerful opportunity to explore the relationship
between individual-level cognition and eective collec-
tive response in a wide range of ecologically-meaningful
contexts. The successful candidate will have access to
brand new state-of-the-art experimental facilities, in-
cluding our sophisticated computational tracking, body
posture and visual eld reconstruction system. Embed-
ded in a multidisciplinary research team, the candidate
will have the opportunity to work closely with experts
in computer vision and machine learning, as well as
in biology, to explore sensory integration and decision-
making in animal groups. The successful candidate will
work both at Princeton University (where experiments
will be conducted) and at the Department of Collective
Behaviour at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology,
Konstanz, Germany.
Information Processing and Computation in Fish
SchoolsWe seek an outstanding scientist for a postdoctoral po-
sition that brings together dynamical self-organisation
and information-theoretic analyses to probe how collec-
tive intelligence emerges within animal groups, using
sh schools as a model system. Rather than assume
an ad-hoc model and tune it to ^ areproduce' group be-
haviours, in this project we will employ data-driven
dimensionality-reduction and probabilistic models from
neuroscience, combined with state-of-the art automated
tracking and visual eld reconstruction to investigate
the computations performed by group members when
making decisions under conditions of uncertainty and
risk.
Investigating the Social Behavior of Fish Using Immer-
sive Closed-Loop Virtual Reality
We seek an outstanding scientist for a postdoctoral
position to develop, and employ, immersive 3D closed-
loop virtual reality (VR) environments to investigate
visually-mediated social behaviours in sh. Like other
group-living vertebrates sh must respond rapidly to
changing visual cues in order to eectively employ social
information when making movement decisions. Conse-
quently they are an excellent system for investigating
the process by which complex, high-dimensional visual
information is translated into low-level movement de-
cisions. Candidates must hold a Ph.D. in computer
science, robotics, biophysics, neuroscience, physics, or
a related eld. Expertise in developing closed-loop VR
environments is not essential, but applicants must be
skilled in C++ and/or Python and have experience with
computer vision / 3D computer graphics.
Open Postdoctoral Fellowships
We seek outstanding postdoctoral candidates from any
background to conduct research in experimental and/or
theoretical studies of collective animal behaviour. We
are particularly interested in quantitative studies of eld
and laboratory systems, although purely theoretically
focused applicants are also encouraged to apply. Our
department is a vibrant and highly international and

New York University Center for Genomics and Systems
Biology
A post-doctoral position at NYU's Center for Genomics
and Systems Biology - in the laboratory of Dr. Gloria
Coruzzi - is available as part of our newly awarded 5
year DOE Grant entitled: EvoNet: A phylogenomic and
systems biology approach to identify genes underlying
plant survival in marginal, low-N soils.
The successful applicant will have skills and experience
in Genomics, Bioinformatics and Phylogenetics. The
position will include experimental/informatic analysis
on NextGen datasets (e.g. overseeing laboratory work,
planning, leading and conducting analyses on RNASeq
data). Skills in R, Perl, Python or other program-
ming language are strongly preferred. This position
also includes Project Management duties, which involve
coordinating scientic activities at six participating in-
stitutions, organizing group meetings, writing grant
reports, paper writing and communicating our work in
conferences and meetings.
This project involves the collaboration of plant sys-
tematists, molecular biologists, genome scientists and
bioinformaticians. PI: Gloria Coruzzi (NYU Center for
Genomics and Systems Biology); Co-PI(s): Rodrigo
Gutierrez (Chile); Robert DeSalle (AMNH); Dennis W
Stevenson (NYBG); W. Richard McCombie (CSHL);
and Jean-Michel Ane & Heidi Kaeppler (UW-Madison).
Project description: This collaborative project exploits
the genomes of extreme survivor plants adapted to thrive
in marginal, extremely nitrogen (N) poor soils in the
arid Chilean Andes. It uses a previously validated phy-
logenomic pipeline we previously developed (Lee et al
2011) and a paired species sampling strategy, to identify
the genes that distinguish these extreme survivors in
Chile from their related species adapted to similarly dry
regions in California (CA) that are not constrained by
N. These ~A^ a:Aextremesurvivor ~A^a: ?`12species coverJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 87
the main branches in owering plants. To maximize
our ability to separate the trait-relevant signature from
overall speciation events, the paired species sampling
will cover multiple independent origins of the low-N
adaptive trait. Our project aims are:
Aim 1. Paired-species collection and sequencing: Use
a paired-species sampling strategy to capture genes in-
volved in adaptations of extreme survivors which grow
on dry, N-poor soils (Chile) compared to their paired
species from California adapted only to drought.
Aim 2. Phylogenomic and Network Analysis: (A) Per-
form phylogenomic analysis of the extreme survivors in
a paired-sampling strategy to identify genes supporting
evolution of adaptations to marginal, low-N soils. (B)
Perform gene network analysis based on gene expression
and interactions.
Aim 3. Integrate Phylogenomic and Network signatures:
Combine phylogenomic signals and gene networks to
prioritize candidate genes associated with adaptations
to marginal, low-N soils.
Aim 4. Functional validation of candidate genes: Func-
tionally validate top-ranked candidate genes for low-N
adaptations in the model plants Arabidopsis and Brachy-
podium.
This project presents an excellent opportunity to work
with scientists from a broad range of expertise. It also in-
cludes opportunities to develop new methods and algor-
tihms for integrating phylogenetics with systems biology
approaches. Therefore, the ideal candidate would have
excellent communication skills and would be motivated
in developing novel analyses methods.

post-doctoral-research-fellow We are seeking a Postdoc-
toral Research Fellow to contribute to the project \Syn-
ergising ecology and evolution: discovering patterns of
functional and phylogenetic diversity of New Zealand's
marine shes versus depth", funded by the Marsden
Fund, Royal Society of New Zealand. Applications close:
19 January (11:45pm, New Zealand Standard time).
Project Overview Biologists know least about the largest
habitat on earth - the deep sea. Fundamental patterns
of functional and phylogenetic biodiversity, from coastal
waters to the abyss, have never been quantied. Do
biodiversity trends in the ocean follow the patterns in
alpha and beta diversity seen in the terrestrial environ-
ment? New Zealand ^As latitudinal range and nearshore
continental shelf oers a unique opportunity to address
trends in biodiversity and community structure and to
disentangle the evolutionary and ecological drivers of
these patterns. This project will complement an existing
stratied and replicated depth by latitude dataset de-
scribing sh community composition. Specically, this
project aims to combine phylogenetic and functional in-
formation with knowledge of community composition for
the shes of New Zealand and to understand the ecolog-
ical and evolutionary drivers of community composition
from the sub-tropics to the sub-antarctic, and from the
shallows to the abyss. The results of these analyses will
have a major impact on the interpretation of the ecology
and evolutionary history of New Zealand ^As sh commu-
nities and biodiversity patterns in the ocean, and will
contribute novel methods of analyses for biodiversity
research.88 EvolDir January 1, 2016
Position Overview We are seeking a motivated and inno-
vative researcher, keen to make their mark in the eld of
quantitative biodiversity research. The ideal candidate
will have a PhD in biology and will have experience
in phylogenetics, diversication analyses, biogeographic
analysis, comparative methods, trait-based analyses,
ecological modeling, multivariate statistics, macroecol-
ogy, and community ecology. Applicants with only a
subset of these skills are encouraged to apply. A track
record of publication in international journals and rele-
vant statistical, computational and programming skills
are expected. The appointed Fellow will conduct phylo-
genetic analyses of new and data-mined sequence data,
and will combine these data with existing community
data, and functional trait data to describe biodiversity
patterns. The Fellow will contribute to the development
of statistical methods to help test explicit hypotheses
that will disentangle evolutionary and ecological drivers
of diversity and turnover. The Fellow is not expected to
have any prior experience in marine eldwork, molecular
genetic benchwork, or ichthyology. The appointee will
be encouraged to supplement the primary research goals
of the project with their own research objectives, in
consultation with the wider research team that includes
Prof. Marti J. Anderson (co-Primary Investigator, Chair
in Statistics, Massey University), Dr. Clive Roberts (co-
Primary Investigator, Head Curator of Fishes, Museum
of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa), Dr. Libby Liggins
(mentor/supervisory role, Lecturer in Marine Ecology,
Massey University) and a recruited PhD candidate (re-
sponsible for functional trait analysis, Massey Univer-
sity). The Fellow will be expected and supported to
publish and present their ndings to international peers.
Prociency in written and spoken English is required.
Position specics The position is three years, start-
ing March 2016 (a later start date may be negoti-
ated for an exceptional candidate). The Fellow will
be based in the Institute of Natural and Mathemati-
cal Sciences (INMS) at Massey University ^As campus
in Auckland, New Zealand. INMS is a recently formed
multi-disciplinary research and teaching Institute incor-
porating Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Math-

Postdoc: Applied Evolutionary Biology
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Selsh genetic elements have been studied for over a cen-
tury, and as far back as the 1960's researchers became
interested in using the power of selsh genetic elements
to drive genes into pest species to suppress their im-
pacts (Gould et al. 2006). Until recently, the focus of
applied work was on naturally occurring elements. In
the past decade some progress was made on developing
synthetic elements that mimicked natural meiotic drive
and selective embryo-killing, but de-novo creation of a
gene-drive system in a pest species was elusive. With
the harnessing of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system in
the past few years there has been a revolution brewing in
this eld (Esvelt et al. 2014, Oye et al. 2014). In March
2015 a pivotal article by Gantz and Bier (2015) came
out in Science demonstrating a CRISPR-Cas9 construct
in Drosophila with strong gene drive.
In the past month, two empirical papers came out that
demonstrate CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive in the mosquito
that transmits malaria and the mosquiot that transmits
dengue (Gantz et al. 2015, Hammond et al. 2015). Not
everyone is comfortable with these developments and
there has even been a call for a moratorium on certain
experiments. There are also concerns about nefarious
use of the technology.
The bottom-line is that progress in molecular biology is
ahead of the population genetic work needed to build
systems that are less risky but accomplish changes in
the public interest.
We have been funded by the NIH and the W. M. Keck
Foundation to conduct this kind of population genetic
research. Our focus has been on mosquitoes that trans-
mit dengue and malaria, but we are also interested in
other biological systems (There is hope that these self-90 EvolDir January 1, 2016
ish genetic elements can save endangered species like
Hawaiian honeycreepers and specic seabirds (Gould
2008, Esvelt et al. 2014).
The postdoc in this position will build a set of simple
to complex models to examine the expected dynamics
of gene drive systems in mosquitoes and other taxa.
The most detailed model that we have developed simu-
lates the population dynamics and population genetics
of Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, in a city on the
Amazon river, Iquitos, for which there are rich data sets
on both mosquito dynamics and dengue epidemiology
(e.g. Magori et al. 2009, Okamoto et al 2014). An
accompanying epidemiological model is currently under
development. The goals of two other postdocs in our
group are to expand the mosquito model and the hu-
man epidemiology model to encompass the entire city of
about 400,000 people. The postdoc in this new position
will collaborate with the other postdocs to use these
detailed models to test gene drive systems, but will also
develop more generic models (e.g. Huang et al. 2010).
In addition to working on model development and analy-
sis, the person in this position will have the opportunity
to collaborate in an interdisciplinary research group
composed of mosquito ecologists, disease epidemiolo-
gists, molecular biologists, biomathematicians, ethicists,
and scientists from disease-endemic countries. We are
dedicated to taking seriously the ethical and political
issues surrounding this technology.
DESIREABLE SKILLS: A background in population
genetics and the ability to program in C++ (or knowl-
edge of a related programming language), and training
in evaluation of mechanistic models.

Postdoc position: \Origin of insect metamorphosis: dis-
section and evolution of themetamorphic gene toolkit"
OUR RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: Insects have un-
dergone radical evolution in their development since
theirorigination from arthropod ancestors, such that
three types of metamorphosis haveemerged: ametaboly,
hemimetaboly and holometaboly. These three
forms ofmetamorphosis represent an evolving sequence
from the primitive ametabolous(direct-developing) to
hemimetabolous (incomplete metamorphosis) to the
mostderived holometabolous type of metamorphosis
(complete metamorphosis).Unfortunately, the nature of
the changes underlying the appearance ofHolometaboly
remains a puzzling problem in evolutionary and develop-
mentalbiology. To this aim, the main goal of the Evol-
MeT project is to characterize themolecular mechanisms
underlying the origin of complete holometabolanmeta-
morphosis.
ELIGIBILITY The successful applicant will hold a PhD

EvolutionaryGenomics
A two-year postdoctoral position in evolutionary ge-
nomics funded by a grant from the Norwegian Research
Council to Assistant Professor Arild Husby is available
at the Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), De-
partment of Biology, <http://www.ntnu.edu/biology
>NTNU, Norway.
Job description The aim of the project is to examine eco-
logical adaptation at the molecular genetic level using
already available SNP genotype data from 4000 individ-
uals genotyped on a 200k SNP array. The data has been
collected in a long-term study of a house sparrow model
system consisting of insular populations at the coast of
Norway, with extensive pedigrees and individual-level
data on phenotypic trait values and tness. The two
main goals of the post doc holder will be to use the SNP
data to test for signs of selection on the genomic level.
This work will be combined with ongoing GWAS work
to link signs of selection in the genome to the genetic
variants underlying phenotypic traits, thereby provid-
ing a link between population genomic approaches and
quantitative genetic work. The second aim is to use
recently developed statistical methods (Ovaskainen et
al. 2011, Genetics 109), Berg & Coop 2014, PLoS Genet
10) to test for polygenic adaption examining correlated
changes in allele frequencies in traits known to be under
divergent selection on dierent islands (Holand et al.
2011, Genet Res 93). Hence, the overall aim of the
project is to provide insights into the molecular genetic
basis of trait variation in natural populations. The suc-
cessful candidate will have the possibility to develop
his/her own ideas to approach the above issues, includ-
ing opportunities for eldwork and laboratory work.
The work will be carried out primarily in the research
group of Assistant Professor Arild Husby, but will be
in close collaboration with Associate Professor Henrik
Jensen, and Professor Otso Ovaskainen. Ass. Prof.
Husby and Prof. Ovaskainen are jointly based at the
Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), NTNU, andJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 95
the Metapopulation Research Centre (MRC), Univer-
sity of Helsinki, whereas Ass. Prof. Jensen is based at

at CBD (Department of Biology, NTNU) but will be ex-
pected to spend considerable time at MRC. The working
language at both institutions is English.
For further information about the postdoctoral posi-
tion please contact Assistant Professor Arild Husby
(Arild.Husby@helsinki., phone no. +358294157691).

ment expertise in statistical/quantitative genetics and
population genomics. Experience with handling data
from next-generation sequencing and/or high-density
SNP genotyping techniques and statistical analyses of
such data is strongly desired and will be considered
an advantage. The successful candidate must be able
to work eciently and goal-oriented both when work-
ing independently and when collaborating with others.
We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic
candidate.
What we oer We can oer an exciting postdoctoral

project is to understand evolution and diversication
of Ctenophora using cutting-edge genomic analyses and
the deep-sea habitat as the generating force of novel
adaptations. We are collecting and generating transcrip-
tomes and genomes from many ctenophore species with
habitat depths down to 4000 meters below the surface.
The postdoctoral associate will use these molecular data
in a phylogenetic context to identify specic genetic
events that underlie physiological tolerances and adap-
tations to the unique selective pressures of life in the
deep sea.
Candidates should have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D.

Skills in programming, phylogenetics, statistical genet-
ics, and/or the application of computational methods
to genomic data are desired. Familiarity with detecting
episodic diversifying selection using techniques such as
branch-site models is highly desirable. Candidates from
groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the
sciences are strongly encouraged to apply.

Post-doctoral position in the phylogenetics of the Corei-
dae (leaf-footed bugs)
A post-doc position is available at the University of
Florida (Gainesville, Florida) to work with Drs. Chris-
tine Miller and Rebecca Kimball on the phylogeny and
evolution of the Coreidae. There are more than 2000
species of these insects worldwide, and male hind femurs
(a sexually-selected weapon) are impressively diverse in
size and shape. Males in many species use their hind
legs as weapons to wrestle over access to females and
territories. A major goal of this project is to examine
the evolutionary interplay between ghting style and
weapon diversication.
This project will involve sequence capture and next-
generation sequencing of 1000's of loci from morpho-
logically diverse members of the Coreidae, along with
morphological dierences in limb morphology, and be-
havioral assays of ghting styles. The phylogeny will
then be used to test hypotheses about the evolution of
morphological traits. The postdoc will be responsible
for helping to develop sequence probes, obtaining spec-
imens for analysis, library construction and sequence
capture, sequence capture, phylogenetic analyses, and
testing hypotheses about trait evolution. In addition,
the postdoc will help in behavioral assays and microevo-
lutionary studies to understand the incipient stages of
weapon diversication.
Integration of research and education is an important
element of the post-doctoral position. The postdoc
will receive training in innovative teaching methods, in-
cluding bringing authentic research into the classroom
through CURE (Classroom-Undergraduate Research
Experience) courses. These courses have the potential
to engage dozens of undergraduates in the scientic pro-
cess including data collection and interpretation. The
post-doc should expect to co-teach one of these CURE
courses each year. Further, the post-doc will engage
in broader impact activities including public outreach
through Bug Fest at the University of Florida and public
speaking in other venues.
Candidates should have completed a PhD (or will very
soon) and have a good knowledge of phylogenetic theory,
analyses and molecular techniques. Ideal candidates will
also have experience in bioinformatics, computational
phylogenetics, managing large phylogenetic datasets,102 EvolDir January 1, 2016
comparative methods and/or animal behavior studies.
Questions and applications should be addressed to Chris-
tine W. Miller, cwmiller@u.edu. Applications should
include: 1) a cover letter outlining your research experi-
ences, interests and career goals; 2) a C.V. including the
names and contact information for at least 3 references;
and 3) copies of up to 3 publications or manuscripts

will receive the highest consideration but applications
through January 1, 2016 may also be considered. The
position could begin as early as March 1, 2016.

lying parallel habitat adaptation in distinct salamander
species
Abstract In a continuously changing world, adaptation
to new or altering environmental conditions is one of
the most elementary and important biological processes.
Although we have much data on the consequences of
habitat adaptation at the phenotypic and population
structure levels, we are currently missing, with a few
exceptions, deeper insights into the genetic architecture
of habitat-dependent adaptation. The study of parallel
adaptive evolution can illuminate underlying processes
and mechanisms. Unlike any other vertebrate group,
amphibian species can show a fascinating breadth of
habitat-specic adaptations to aquatic and terrestrial
habitats. The research teams of this proposal have stud-
ied parallel ecological adaptation to larval reproductive
habitats in two distinct species of re salamanders -
Salamandra salamandra in Germany and Salamandra
infraimmaculata in Israel. By integrating a strong eco-
logical context with genomic approaches, this research
proposal aims at extending the ecological-genetic frame-
work of parallel habitat adaptation to the level of the
transcriptome in order to simultaneously screen a large
number of genes for patterns of evolutionary divergence.
We will design species-specic oligonucleotide microar-
rays based on EST sequences of the larval transcrip-
tomes for each species. These microarrays can then be
used to analyze gene expression patterns under fully
natural conditions and in experimental setups, whereby
analyses are inspired by eld studies that analyze the
ecology of salamander larvae. As salamander larvae are
accessible in large numbers and can be easily manipu-
lated in common environment experiments, this study
system is suited to explore gene-expression responses to
habitat-specic cues or selection pressures in dedicated
experiments reecting distinct larval habitat types and
ecological parameters. The resulting data will reveal
whether plastic phenotypes contribute to adaptive phe-
notypic change and whether they are enhanced by the
emergence of genetically xed traits. In addition to tra-
ditional computational methods, we shall use a newly
developed individual-centered approach, using a new
vector-correlation measure to identify genes that are
co-expressed in individuals as opposed to dierential
expression of genes across populations.

UIowa InsectEvolution
The Forbes Lab in the Department of Biology at the
University of Iowa is seeking a highly motivated evo-
lutionary ecologist with an interest in tropical insect
diversity and expertise in population genomics for a 2-3
year postdoctoral position funded by NSF's Dimensions
of Biodiversity Program.
Job Summary: The aim of the project is to examine
patterns of present day and historical gene ow among
species in the tephritid fruit y genus Blepharoneura
and the same for the Bellopius parasitoid wasps that
attack Blepharoneura ies. These ies and wasps are
highly host-specic, incredibly diverse, and many species
often overlap in their apparent niche space. A major
goal is to understand why these insects are so diverse.
The postdoc will develop and score double-digest RAD
markers for several existing y and wasp collections from
across Central and South America, use those data to
model gene ow and migration within each y and wasp
species, and collaborate with other project participants
to test hypotheses regarding species interactions and the
origin of reproductive isolation in these hyper-diverse
insect systems. More information about this system can
be found in the following two publications:
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5878/-
928.short http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/-

MultispeciesMutualisms
A postdoctoral position is available to work in Elizabeth
Pringle's lab on the chemical and evolutionary ecology of
plant-ant-hemipteran interactions. Our aim is to under-

across scales of ecological organization, from organism to
ecosystem. To do this, we combine greenhouse and eldexperiments with chemical and molecular approaches,
including evolutionary genetics and metabolomics. A
particular area of interest is determining the extent and
character of genetic variation in plant phloem chemistry
and its eects across multiple trophic levels.
The start date is September 2016, with some exibility
in either direction. Applicants should have a PhD in bi-
ology or a related eld. The ideal candidate would have
training in LC/MS metabolomics and/or evolutionary
genetics. A strong interest in the ecology of plants and
arthropods is required.

USouthDakota PhenoscapeProject
Postdoctoral fellow: Bioinformatics, Phenomics
The Phenoscape project (http://phenoscape.org) is re-
cruiting a postdoc with training in bioinformatics and/or
developmental biology who is interested in analyzing ge-
nomic and developmental data in relation to phenotypic
data, with a focus on the vertebrate n/limb.
The problem of how organismal phenotypes have evolved,
are constrained, and acquire novelty, is one of the grand
challenges in biology. The Phenoscape group has devel-
oped ontology-based methods for representing species
phenotypes so that they can be integrated with model
organism developmental and genetic data. The projects
Knowledgebase (KB; kb.phenoscape.org) contains over
500,000 vertebrate species phenotypes that are linked to
~16,000 genes associated with 320,000+ phenotypes and
37,000 genes with in situ expression data from model
organisms (zebrash, mouse, Xenopus human). These
data present a tremendous opportunity for integrationwith other data types to address questions about the
evolution of phenotype.
We are seeking an individual with expertise in develop-
mental biology and/or genomics, to (1) help evaluate
results of bioinformatics methods being developed by
Phenoscape and (2) leverage the Phenoscape Knowledge-
base to study whole-organism phenotype and functional
genomics in non-model organisms. The purpose of the
methods is to improve prediction of the genetic basis of
evolutionarily novel phenotypes by incorporating seman-
tic similarity, homology, and phylogenetic propagation.
Vertebrate n and limb phenotypes and genes are en-
riched in the KB, and we are thus seeking candidates
who ideally have knowledge of genes and networks in-
volved n/limb development. Further, this position
presents a unique opportunity to leverage the linked de-
velopmental and genetic data in the Phenoscape KB for
large-scale analysis of patterns of phenotypic evolution.
a
The postdoc will work under the direction of Paula
Mabee (University of South Dakota) in association with
Todd Vision (University of North Carolina), as part
of a distributed, multidisciplinary team that includes
evolutionary and model organism biologists, computer
scientists, and bioinformaticists. Ideally the applicant
will be based in South Dakota (with opportunities to
travel to other sites), but we will consider qualied
applicants who are available remotely and/or half-time.
Starting date: This full time postdoctoral position is
available to be lled as early as January 2016 (one year
with potential to renew).
Required qualications:
* Ph.D. degree with strong background in bioinformatics;
previous experience with ontologies preferred * Experi-
ence in functional genomics or developmental biology,
with preference for candidates with a background in
vertebrate n and/or limb developmen * Demonstrated
communication and writing skills in English * Demon-
strated ability to work in a team setting
How to apply: Please contact Dr. Mabee

be directed to Dr. Mabee and include a cover letter,
CV, a brief statement detailing your research interests
and career goals, and three letters of reference. For

Post-doc position on ageing patterns in Asian elephants
A postdoctoral position focused on ageing patterns in
Asian elephants will be available in Prof. Virpi Lum-

versity of Turku, Finland. The position is part of Prof.
Lummaa's ERC-funded project to study the patterns
of mortality and reproductive senescence and identify
their underlying health correlates, using a large longi-
tudinal dataset on life-histories of a semi-captive popu-
lation of Asian elephants in Myanmar (Burma). More
information about the project is available at http://-

doc will take advantage of exceptional lifelong health
data recorded for the Myanmar timber elephants com-
bined with newly collected data on a range of correlates
of health, condition and reproductive status to conduct a
comprehensive study on the links between reproductive
investment and proximate correlates of reproductive and
survival senescence. The postdoctoral researcher will
supervise the digitalisation of bi-monthly health assess-
ments and disease history of the population, and lead
research on investigating changes in annual health status
and specic disease prevalence of individual elephants,
and how these link to growth, physiological measures of
health, breeding success across life and longevity. Asian
elephants are endangered and both wild and captive pop-
ulations are predicted to vanish from Myanmar unless
the vital rates improve. Understanding health correlates
of reproductive and mortality rates thus aids developing
management and conservational policies. The successful

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to work on
landscape genomics and transcriptomics of Tasmaniandevils and Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease. This
NSF -funded international collaboration builds on over
15 years of research tracking the spread of this unique
infectious tumor across Tasmania and consequent en-
dangerment of the iconic Tasmanian devil. Reference
genomes are available for both tumor and devil and
population genomic data have already been collected
for>3500 Tasmanian devil individuals. The successful
applicant will have an unprecedented opportunity to
analyze thousands of devil genotypes and hundreds of
tumor samples taken both before and after epizootics to
test for selection throughout both genomes, coevolution,
patterns of resistance, etc, across Tasmania. We will
then use these data to predict the course of disease in
uninfected populations. The position is centered in the
lab of Dr. Andrew Storfer (www.wsu.edu/ ~storfer) at
Washington State University, in close collaboration with
Dr. Paul Hohenlohe at the nearby University of Idaho

ComparativeEmbryology
Jun13-Jul15
Hello all, Applications are now being accepted for the
Comparative Invertebrate Embryology course at the
Friday Harbor Labs (June 13 - July 15, 2016).
It is a great course for anyone interested in the evolution
of development, developmental mechanisms, animal evo-
lution, or the ecology or physiology of early life stages.
The focus of the course is hands-on observation of living
embryos and larvae from over a dozen animal phyla.
The Friday Harbor Labs gives access to an extraordi-
nary variety of organisms from diverse marine habitats,
all in a beautiful setting, and provides opportunities to
interact with a broad community of biologists from all
over.
I will be co-teaching the course with Dr. Sally Leys, an
expert on the development of sponges and the evolution
of animal body plans. My own research focuses on theJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 113
roles of biomechanics in development-environment in-
teractions. In addition, we will have guest lectures from
experts on diverse topics and taxa.
For the course description, please
see: http://depts.washington.edu/fhl/-
studentSummer2016.html#SumA-2 . Be sure to
check out some of the other exciting courses oered at
the Friday Harbor Labs too.
Please share with students who might be interested.

ogy June 13 - July 15, 2016
This course will be taught by Dr. Megan Schwartz
(University of Washington, Tacoma) and Dr. Kevin
Kocot (University of Alabama and Alabama Museum
of Natural History). The course takes advantage of the
rich marine biota of the Friday Harbor region to teach
the principles of animal organization and biodiversity.
It emphasizes comparative study of form and function,
and of complexity and diversity in phylogenetic and en-
vironmental contexts. It focuses on the study of living
animals in the laboratory and eld in the diverse marine
habitats surrounding San Juan Island.
The course reviews the diversity of animal life in an
evolutionary and ecological context, focusing on the
comparative study of form, function and life history.
We will review all animal phyla, and also explore diver-
sity within phyla based on available exemplars.
Biodiversity is one of the most topical subjects in biology,
partly because of its accelerating erosion as a result of
increasing human pressures and global change. Having a
working knowledge of the diversity of life is fundamental
to the study of any subject in biology. FHL is arguably
the best location in the US for such a course, given the
wealth of local diversity and accumulated knowledge of
the local fauna built over a century of investigations.
Applications are welcome from advanced undergraduate
students, post-baccalaureates, and graduate students.
Prior coursework in invertebrate biology or animal di-versity will be useful; if in doubt, please contact one of
the instructors.
Enrollment is limited to 20 students. No textbook is
required for this course.

plication instructions) please see the course

Genialis is a bioinformatics company that shares the in-
house knowledge by organising bioinformatics courses.
BioBash workshops are intensive hands-on trainings
where you actually do bioinformatics rather just attend
lectures and watch demonstrations. Designed by bi-
ologists for biologists, they are ideal for life scientists
who are starting to implement bioinformatics into their
research as well as those eager to upgrade their data
analysis skills. Be it Linux, Python or R, our workshops
focus on putting the newly acquired skills immediately
into practice.
We have just announced two workshops that will be held
in Ljubljana, in February 2016, and registrations are
now open -https://www.genialis.com/events/ BioBash
R: 1. - 5. February BioBash R Workshop will teach the
participants how to eciently explore their data. Start-
ing from the very beginning, learn how to summarize
and reshape data, discover patterns in the data, and cre-
ate meaningful as well as beautiful graphical summaries.
Moreover, a full day introduction into BioConductor will
teach you how to analyze next-generation sequencing
data with R.
BioBash Essentials: 15. - 19. February BioBash Essen-
tials is aimed at life scientists with little or no knowledge
of basic bioinformatic skills. Common and general tools
such as Linux command line and regular expressions
are explained through practice, and more work is put
into building solid programming foundations in Python.
The participants learn how to tackle many everyday
tasks that come up regardless of their actual scientic
question, for example automating repetitive tasks such
as querying online databases or extracting information
from endless text les. Moreover, a full day introduction
into the NGS data analysis will be given, covering in
practice the logic behind the ltering, assembly and
mapping of short reads.
All our workshops in 2015 were full of enthusiastic
trainees who left much better prepared to tackle their
data challenges. Let us invite you to read their feedback
-https://www.genialis.com/biobash-customer-reviews/ .

TIME SERIS MODELS FOR ECOLOGISTS AND CLI-
MATOLOGISTS
This course is being delivered by Dr Andrew Parnell, It
will run from 9th - 12th of May 2016 at SCENE (the
Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environ-
ment), Loch Lomond National Park, Glasgow.
Course overview: This course will cover model-based
time series analysis with a particular focus on applica-
tions in ecology and climatology. All methods will be
illustrated using the free, open-source software package
R. Time Series data are ubiquitous in the physical sci-
ences, and models for their behaviour enable scientists
to understand temporal dynamics and predict future
values. Participants will be taught a wide range of
suitable time series models for both discrete and con-
tinuous time systems. The course takes a foundational
Bayesian approach, which will enable participants to
have a deeper understanding of the models being tted,
and to estimate all unknown quantities with uncertainty.
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data sets
for discussion with the course tutors.
This workshop is aimed at research postgraduates, prac-
ticing academics in ecology, climatology, evolution, me-
teorology, conservation and environmental management,
and environmental professionals in government and in-
dustry.
The workshop is delivered over 8 half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). The session will consist
of Introductory lectures on the concepts and refreshers
on R usage. Intermediate-level lectures interspersed with
hands-on mini practicals and longer projects. Finally,
round-table discussions about the analysis requirements
of attendees (optional - bring your own data).
Assumed background: A basic understanding of statis-
tical concepts. Such as regression modelling and gener-
alised linear models. Some understanding of Bayesian
Statistics is recommended but will be covered during
the introductory sessions. Familiarity with R. Ability to
import/export data, manipulate data frames, t basic
statistical models & generate simple exploratory and
diagnostic plots.
Curriculum: Day 1: Basic conceptsClass 1: Introduction; some example time series datasets;
prediction vs explanation
Class 2: An introduction to Bayesian Statistics.
Class 3: The AR(1) model
Practical: revision on using R to load data, create plots
and t statistical models

\Spatial analysis of ecological data using R"
Delivered by Prof. Jason Matthiopoulos
This course will run from 11th - 17th April 2016 at
Mileport Field Station, Isle of Cumbrae, Scotland
The course will cover the concepts and R tools that
can be used to analyse spatial data in ecology covering
elementary and advanced spatial analysis techniques
applicable to both plants and animals. We will investi-
gate analyses appropriate to transect (e.g. line surveys,
trapping arrays), grid (e.g. occupancy surveys) and
point data (e.g. telemetry). The focal questions will
be on deriving species distributions, determining their
environmental drivers and quantifying dierent types of
associated uncertainty. Novel methodology for generat-
ing predictions will be introduced. We will also address
the challenges of applying the results of these methods
to wildlife conservation and resource management and
communicate the ndings to non-experts.

Dear Colleagues
The 2016 edition of the Evolutionary Biology Workshop
in the Alps will take place on 21-27June 2016 in Arolla,
Switzerland.
Target participants are PhD students in early stages of
PhD and advanced Master students - please pass the
info to potential participants.
The main goals of this annual workshop, based on a con-
cept developed by Stephen Stearns and John Maynard
Smith, are to develop the following skills: - developing
your scientic ideas through discussions in groups; -
thinking critically and expressing oneself clearly; - turn-
ing a general idea into a research project; - writing a
research proposal and defending it.
Faculty: Bill Rice (University of California Santa Bar-
bara) Dolph Schluter (University of British Columbia)
Tanja Schwander (University of Lausanne) John Pannell
(University of Lausanne) Tad Kawecki (University of
Lausanne)
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you willchoose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back
seat. Additionally, the faculty will give talks about their
research and be available for informal discussion with
individual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in the 100-year old ho-
tel Kurhaus http://www.hotel-kurhaus.arolla.com/, lo-
cated in a small alpine village at an altitude of 2000 m,
which will help you to concentrate on the course while
giving you also the chance to enjoy the views, small
hikes, marmots and the alpine ora.
Fee: CHF 450.- (this covers part of the cost for room
and board, the rest being subsidized by the Herbette
Foundation).
Participants will receive a course certicate for 3 ETCS
credits.
To apply, send a single le (pdf or rtf) contain-
ing a short motivation letter including a brief sum-
mary of your research interest, a cv, and the
name of your scientic advisor to Caroline Betto-
Colliard <ecologie-evolution@cuso.ch >, with Cc to
tadeusz.kawecki@unil.ch . Please put \Evolutionary
workshop" in the subject. Application Deadline: Febru-
ary 14, 2016.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoralJanuary 1, 2016 EvolDir 121
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
