Aug14-19 CallAbstracts
Dear all,
We are very happy to announce abstract submission
is now open for our ESEB 2022 symposium \Revisit-
ing chromosomal speciation in the genomic era". The
meeting will take place in Prague, Czech Republic
from August 14-19. 2022 and abstracts can be submit-
ted here https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-
page. The deadline is April 15. 2022.
Our symposium asks to what extent major chromo-
somal rearrangements may act as intrinsic barriers to
gene ow, especially in the context of recent genomic
advancements. Are they by themselves sucient to
result in speciation, or do they promote speciation by
interacting with other barriers? How do chromosomal
rearrangements evolve in the rst place and why are
some taxonomic groups more variable in their karyotype
than others? Do higher rates of chromosomal evolution
result in higher rates of speciation? Do the evolutionary
processes and mechanisms dier between species whose
chromosomes have localised centromeres, and those who
are holocentric? Do chromosomal rearrangements have
a dierent evolutionary impact depending on whether
autosomes or sex chromosomes are involved?
We aim to address these open questions from a broad
perspective and aim to bring together both theoretical
and empirical researchers .
Our keynote speakers are Marcial Escudero (Univer-
sity of Seville) and Petr Nguyen (University of SouthFebruary 1, 2022 EvolDir 5
Bohemia).
We are looking forward to your abstracts and to meeting
you in Prague!

Dear all,
Abstract submission is now open for our ESEB 2022 sym-
posium, \Evolutionary ecology of chemically-mediated
species interactions in plants". The meeting will be held
in Prague, Czech Republic from August 14-19.
Interactions between plants and other organisms occur
in every terrestrial biome and have long been a focal
point of the eld of evolutionary ecology. These in-
teractions have spurred the spectacular structural and
chemical complexity in owering plants, such as oral
volatiles that attract pollinators and leaf metabolites
that deter herbivores. While most research to date has
considered how these traits structure interactions among
species and mediate reproductive isolation, a critical
prerequisite is the existence of intraspecic variation
in chemical traits. Recent advances in analytical and
computational methods have allowed the eld to move
towards untargeted metabolomics approaches, while
facilitating rigorous investigations of long-standing ques-
tions. By investigating intraspecic variation across
populations, tissue types, or time points, studies have
begun to identify how genomic and environmental fac-
tors shape the diversication of these traits and connect
intraspecic variation to larger scale macroevolutionary
studies. The purpose of this symposium is to bring to-
gether researchers studying variation in plant mediated
interactions from across scales of biological organization
from between individuals, populations and species. This
symposium will attract researchers across career stages
and study systems who are increasing our understanding
plant species interactions through studying patterns or
drivers of variation in chemical traits.
The two keynote speakers for the session are Dr. James
Buckley (University of Plymouth) and Dr. MarjorieWeber (Michigan State University).
We especially encourage submissions from early career
researchers and from researchers from historically un-
derrepresented groups. ESEB has funding opportunities
to support meeting attendance, including conference
travel awards for early career researchers (https://-
eseb.org/prizes-funding/conference-travel-award/) and
attendance aid grants for caregiving women and others
who incur additional costs when attending meetings
(https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/equal-opportunities-

Dear Evoldir Communtiy,
We are very happy to announce our ESEB 2022 Sym-
posium \TUG OF WAR BETWEEN THE SEXES:
THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC ARCHITECTURE OF
SEX-LINKED TRAITS". ESEB2022 will take place
in Prague (Czech Republic), 14-19th of August
2022https://www.eseb2022.cz/ . Abstract submis-
sions is now open https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-
abstracts-page(deadline: 15 April 2022).
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:Sexually dimorphic- and
in their most drastic form- sex-limited phenotypes re-
sult from sexually antagonistic selection and are largely
realized via dierential gene expression. Since the sexes
share a genome, the same set of genes can be subject
to dierent, even opposing, selection in the two sexes.
In this symposium, we investigate the transcriptomic
architecture of sex-linked traits including morphologi-
cal, physiological as well as behavioral sex-dierences.
We encourage submissions that apply new sequencing6 EvolDir February 1, 2022
technologies, functional assays and analyses that con-
tribute to our understanding of how sex-linked traits
are build up, how they evolve under particular selec-
tive constraints and how sexual conict is traceable and
probably resolved on the molecular level. This sympo-
sium will target core questions of evolutionary biology
such as the interplay of natural and sexual selection and
the costs of non-adaptive trait evolution. Contributions
will shed light on evolutionary paths of genes that have
a dierent function in each sex and aims to tackle how
sex-specic traits are build up from a common genome.
With this topic, the symposium will contribute to a next
step in evolutionary biology aiming to connect models
of sequence evolution and predictions of the power of
selective forces with functional data. The invited speak-
ers for this symposium are Tanja Schwander (University
of Lausanne) and Armin Moczek (Indiana University
Bloomington)

Dear Colleagues,We are very happy to announce our ESEB 2022 Sympo-
sium \PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS IN ADAPTA-
TION GENOMICS".
WHERE & WHEN? The symposium will be held at
the ESEB 2022 conference in Prague (Czech Republic),
14-19 August 2022 (https://www.eseb2022.cz/).
ABSTRACT SUBMISSIONS Abstract submissions is
now open at: https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-
abstracts-page (deadline: 15 April 2022).
THE TOPIC The overarching aim of our symposium is
to bring together evolutionary biologists interested in
using genomics to understand adaptive processes and
evolutionary history and to discuss recent progress and
future prospects in this eld. Population genetics deals
with three fundamental questions: (1) How much ge-
netic variation exists in populations? (2) How is this
variation maintained? (3) What is the genetic basis of
evolutionary change? While population genomics has
answered the rst question, the second and third remain
incompletely understood. We plan an exciting diversity
of talks on cutting-edge topics in adaptation genomics,
including on the importance of temporally and spatially
varying selection in maintaining variation; on the im-
portance of history, hybridization and introgression in
patterning such variation; on appropriate null models
of evolutionary change that incorporate demography;
on selective sweeps versus polygenic adaptation; and
on identifying and validating targets of selection. We
encourage contributions from both empirical and statis-
tical / theoretical population geneticists, especially from
early career researchers. Apart from fostering in-depth
discussion, a tangible outcome of this symposium will
be a targeted review submitted to JEB. This sympo-
sium is organized on behalf of the European Drosophila
Population Genomics Consortium (DrosEU; https://-
droseu.net/), a consortium funded by a ESEB Special
Topics Network (STN) grant.

EvolAntibioticResistance Aug14-19
We are very happy to announce our ESEB 2022 Sym-
posium \Evolution of antibiotic resistance: from lab to
clinic" (S36).
*WHERE AND WHEN* The symposium will be held
at the Congress of the European Society for Evolution-
ary Biology in Prague, 14-19 August 2022 (https://-
www.eseb2022.cz/).
*MOTIVATION* Laboratory evolution experiments are
a powerful tool for addressing fundamental evolution-
ary questions under controlled conditions. They are
also increasingly used to address applied problems, such
as the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance.These studies have revealed important novel insights
about the mechanisms and evolvability of antibiotic resis-
tance and their dependence on bacterial stress-responses,
metabolism and drug combinations, which may inform
new therapies. However, results from laboratory evo-
lution experiments under articial conditions are often
not directly relevant for the clinical problem of antibi-
otic resistance, due to dierences between laboratory
and clinical strains and conditions. Researchers have
therefore begun to study the evolution of antibiotic re-
sistance in animals and patients. In this symposium, we
bring together researchers working on both sides of the
 >1
2laboratory-clinic divide', as well as those that start
to bridge the gap. Our specic aim is to identify perti-
nent questions and caveats in the translation between
lab experiments and the clinical problem of antibiotic
resistance. How can laboratory experiments under ar-
ticial conditions complement analyses in animals and
patients and inform new drug therapies? A more gen-
eral aim of our symposium is to discuss the relevance of
evolutionary biology for our health and wellbeing.

Nacional de Biotecnologia ' CSIC, Madrid) Robert A.

Dear colleagues,
Our ESEB 2022 symposium \Eco-evolutionary dynam-
ics in changing environments: insights from models,
experiments and case studies" (S10), is now open for8 EvolDir February 1, 2022
submissions (see https://www.eseb2022.cz for further
details).
Eco-evolutionary dynamics is fundamental to our under-
standing of processes that shape species' distributions
and their capacity to adapt. Notably, due to the unabat-
ing climate change, environmental conditions change at
an unprecedented speed and often exhibit higher uc-
tuations. These can increase the selective pressures on
the populations and may drive major shifts in species
composition. In this context, an improved understand-
ing of eco-evolutionary processes is not only relevant to
grasp the conditions for the maintenance of biodiversity
but is also essential to provide informed management
policies.
Necessarily, experiments and theory develop in tandem:
without theory, one does not know what to measure;
and without experiments, no theory can be corrobo-
rated and assumptions may go seriously astray. The
proposed symposium aims to foster the dialogue between
theory in evolutionary ecology and assessment of the eco-
evolutionary dynamics in both natural and experimental
evolution. The focus will be on evolution with spatial
and/or temporal variation, where eco-evolutionary pro-
cesses are especially important. For modelling contribu-
tions, it will be required that the theory is formulated
in a way which makes it in principle testable in natural
or experimental populations. Extension to coevolution
and macroecological theory are welcome.
Our two keynote speakers are Jason P. Sexton (Uni-
versity of California) and Ruth A. Hufbauer (Colorado
State University).
Abstracts can be submitted on: https://-
www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-page. Deadline
is April 15 2022.

IntegrativeBiogeography Aug14-19
Dear all,
We are excited to welcome submissions to our sympo-
sium at ESEB 2022:
* S08. INTEGRATIVE BIOGEOGRAPHY: PAST,
PRESENT, FUTURE *
Biogeography, the distribution of species over space and
time, is a dynamic eld inuenced by geology, ecology,
evolution and the environment and it requires truly
integrative investigation. Biogeographic processes are
intimately linked with evolutionary change through vi-
cariance and peripatry, gene ow, drift, and ecological
opportunity arising during colonization and promoting
adaptive radiations. Moreover, researchers are increas-
ingly uncovering ways that a species' biogeographic his-
tory can aect its potential for evolutionary rescue under
contemporary change. Thus resolving biogeographical
patterns and associated evolutionary dynamics, both
within and among species, is essential for understanding
mechanisms of species adaptation and for predicting
future eco-evolutionary dynamics against the backdrop
of environmental change. Recent work integrates in-
formation from paleontological and phylogenetic data,
genomics, experimentation, and modeling to reconstruct
ancestral ranges, investigate evolutionary consequences
of contemporary distributional shifts, and predict fu-
ture resilience and spread. These diverse approaches
ultimately provide a holistic understanding of the micro-
and macroevolutionary causes and consequences of bio-
geography. In this symposium, we aim to showcase
these advances by bringing together researchers who use
integrative methods to investigate reciprocal eects of
biogeography and evolutionary processes across tempo-
ral and spatial scales. We will also use this opportunity
to discuss future ideas and perspectives for the eld.

Dear Colleagues,
We are very happy to announce our ESEB 2022 Sympo-
sium \*LIMITS TO ADAPTATION: LINKING EVO-
LUTION, ECOLOGY AND GENETICS*" (S31).
*WHERE AND WHEN* The symposium will be held
at the Congress of the European Society for Evolution-
ary Biology in Prague,  >1
214-19 August 2022 (https://-
www.eseb2022.cz/).
*ABSTRACT* Adaptation to environmental change
has been studied for decades, yet adaptation and mal-
adaptation in nature are still only partially understood.
One probable reason for this is that the factors limiting
adaptation ' demography, genetic constraints, ecolog-
ical instability, etc. ' are mainly studied in isolation.
In real adaptive processes, however, these evolutionary
constraints occur and interact simultaneously. Focusing
on evolution, ecology, and genetics independently can
therefore give a biased view of the adaptive process.
This symposium aims to improve our understanding
of adaptation to environmental change by synthesizing
and linking recent studies on multiple evolutionary con-
straints. We welcome empirical and theoretical studies:
- that examine single constraints on adaptation; - that
test or discover the eects of interactions between con-
straints. Limits to adaptation are a crucial aspect of
evolutionary responses to any natural or anthropogenic
change. Because research is currently scattered across
disciplines, we hope that this symposium will be anopportunity to unite researchers studying e.g. ecological
specialization, evolutionary rescue, and eco-evolutionary
dynamics. We will synthesize our understanding of in-
teracting evolutionary constraints and stimulate new
integrative research.

Prague ESEB RapidEvolution
Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
Our symposium S12 \Resurrection ecology as a tool
for the study of rapid evolution" at the ESEB 2022
conference is now open for submissions.
link for submissions and other key information are be-
low.
Invited speakers: Niek Scheepens, Goethe-Universit at
Frankfurt, Germany Luc De Meester, KU Leuven, Bel-
gium
Abstract
It is now accepted that rapid evolution (within a dozen
generations) can occur, contrary to the classical Dar-
winian view that assumes slow pace of evolution. Rapid
evolution is particularly frequent in response to contem-
porary anthropogenic modication of the environment10 EvolDir February 1, 2022
(e.g. climate change, pollution), although demonstrating
its adaptive character remains challenging.
Resurrection ecology (RE) is an inventive approach to
study evolution based on the ancestral populations re-
viving (decades old) from dormant forms (seeds, spores,
cysts). Comparing ancestral and current genotypes is a
powerful methodology for demonstrating adaptive rapid
evolution, although often limited by the fortuitous avail-
ability of ancestral material in sediments or seed banks.
Being at its beginnings, it is important that good RE
practices are established to set up the premises for future
studies.
This symposium covers various challenges and innova-
tions of RE: 1) practical issues such as constituting or
recovering appropriate propagule banks, their conser-
vation, and the limits of available model organisms in
relation to their life history traits, 2) analytical method-
ology (population and quantitative genetics) disentan-
gling selective from stochastic evolutionary processes,
and 3) case studies in various organisms illustrating the
power of RE to demonstrate rapid evolution. We thus
aim at providing insights into RE possibilities, but also
inspiring actions for future RE studies.

Prague MatingSystem Aug14-19
CallForAbstract
Dear all,
Our ESEB 2022 symposium, \The Evolutionary Ecology
of Mating Systems", is now open for submissions (seehttps://www.eseb2022.cz for further details).
Mating system research has been the subject of both evo-
lutionary (e.g., how outcrossing and sex promote more
ecient selection) and ecological studies (e.g., plant-
pollinator interactions, studies of species invasiveness).
Nevertheless, interactions between the two elds remain
rare, despite recent approaches that blur traditional
boundaries. This symposium will unite speakers from
dierent disciplines to facilitate ideas on how to suc-
cessfully integrate both ecological and evolutionary ap-
proaches into the study of mating systems, and discuss
what challenges need to be overcome.
The meeting will be held in in Prague, Czech Republic
during the 14-19 August. The two keynote speakers are
Dr Diala Abu Awad (Universit e Paris-Saclay) and Prof.
Laura Galloway (The University of Virginia).
ESEB also proposes a grant in order to ensure equal
opportunities. The grant aims to achieve this by
increasing the attendance of underrepresented groups,
primarily, but not solely, caregiving women (who due
to higher costs of childcare are often prevented from
attending)*, *through positive discrimination. The
grant provides stipends of nancial aid for scientists
to help with the additional costs borne privately due
to responsibilities for dependents when attending the
meetings. The stipend will contribute to covering
expenses for care of dependents, but also for travel. See
https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/equal-opportunities-
initiative/congress-attendance-aid-grant/ for further
details.
We invite all interested contributors to submit their
abstracts!

Symposium S22 <https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/-
symposia >: Phenotypic plasticity's importance in evo-
lution: Same old dog or new tricks?
The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has been
debated for over a century, but there is still no consensus
about its general eects on processes such as adaptation
and speciation, or more importantly, whether plasticity's
causal impact on the evolutionary process is comparable
to factors such as direct environmental change, ecol-
ogy, selection, genetic mutation, etc. Arguments for a
strong role in evolution have been given renewed atten-
tion recently, and form an important basis for calls to
\extend" basic evolutionary theory. However, these ideas
have attracted considerable criticism. Is the substan-
tial research attention paid to the role of plasticity in
evolution warranted by its actual importance? We will
address this question by undertaking a critical synthe-
sis based on recent theoretical advances and empirical
ndings. With this symposium we will bring together
scientists studying evolutionary causes and consequences
of phenotypic plasticity from a wide variety of research
traditions, with emphasis on narrowing the data-theory
gap. The symposium and a potential associated target
review in Journal of Evolutionary Biology are intended
to re-focus this subeld of evolutionary biology, and
identify research priorities for the future that capital-
ize on advances in genetics, behaviour and theoretical
modelling.

person and live-streamed followed by three consecutive
Fridays from March 25- April 8, 2022. Eight early career
scientists will be selected to present their work, and two
keynote speakers will be featured. The symposium will
kick o with an in-person and live-streamed event on
March 19th. The symposium will move to a virtual
format in the following weeks, with two to three partic-
ipants presenting each week, followed by a moderated
discussion.
For the symposium, we consider early career scientists
as senior graduate students (who stand to receive their
Ph.D. within two years), postdoctoral researchers, fac-
ulty or sta scientists within their rst or second year,

BOKU-Vienna 3 BeetleEvol
Graduate position, bark beetle life-cycle regulation,
BOKU Vienna: The University of Natural Resources
and Life Sciences, Vienna, BOKU (Department of For-
est and Soil Sciences; Institute of Forest Entomology,
Forest Pathology and Forest Protection) is oering a
3-year PhD position to study life-cycle regulation and
host plant adaptation of the pine bark beetle, Ips acumi-
natus.
One aim of the project is to study the eects of environ-
mental conditions, particularly temperature and pho-
toperiod, on the development of I. acuminatus. Under
lab and eld conditions, we will evaluate the inuence
of dierent abiotic conditions on the beetle's develop-
mental time, to infer various thermal parameters. The
ndings will increase our understanding of the eects
elicited by environmental parameters on the life history
of this widespread insect.
Furthermore, I. acuminatus colonizes dierent conifer
species, mostly pines but also Douglas r. Under lab
conditions, we will assess its preference for certain tree
species and evaluate its breeding performance, i.e. re-
productive success, in dierent host species, with the
aim to understand patterns of host plant adaptations.
We are looking for a candidate who has strong interest
in hands-on experimental work with insects, in statis-
tical analysis of data, and is passionate in writing. A
MSc degree in Biology, Ecology, Zoology, Entomology,
Forestry or related elds is desired. Furthermore, in-
terest in molecular work, knowledge in statistics (e.g.
using R) and excellent writing and communication skills
would be an advantage.
The 3-year project will be conducted in Vienna, one of
the most-livable cities worldwide. BOKU Vienna has
about 12,000 students with focus on life sciences. The
institute deals with various entomological and mycolog-
ical topics in forest ecosystems, with numerous PhDs,
Postdocs and research sta. Gross salary is 2,294 EUR
(14 times per year, plus ination adjustment each year).
The project starts in March 2022, applications will be
accepted until the position is lled. Please send a CV,
if available a list of publications, a letter of motivation,
and contacts of two references to the project PI Mar-
tin Schebeck, martin.schebeck@boku.ac.at. In case you
have any questions don't hesitate to send an e-mail.

BristolU AdaptationViaImprinting
We encourage applications for a funded Master's by Re-
search opportunity to study the role of larval imprinting
in the success of insect crop pests. The project will use
both comparative and experimental approaches, and
is jointly supervised by Dr Sinead English (evelab.org)
and Steve Montgomery (www.shmontgomery.co.uk) at
the University of Bristol (UK), in collaboration with
Dr Kwasi Asante (CSIR, Ghana) and Richard Merril
(University of Munich, Germany).
Project description:
Insect crop pests are a major challenge to global food se-
curity. A potential mechanism underlying insects' ability
to infest new plants is through larval imprinting, where
host plant preferences of an adult are determined by the
plant they experienced as a larva. However, whether
such imprinting facilitates the success of crop pests at
adapting to new agricultural host plants is unclear. In-
deed, there has yet to be a general comparative study
on the prevalence and eectiveness of larval imprinting
in plant-feeding insects in general.
In this project, the student will produce the rst com-
parative study of larval imprinting across plant-feeding
insects - focusing on which characteristics of crop pest
species make them more amenable to using imprinting
to switch to new host species. The student will also con-
duct their own experimental study to test predictions
raised by this comparative approach and use insights
from evolutionary ecology and developmental neurobiol-
ogy to establish why and how such larval imprinting is
retained across life stages.
Understanding host plant switches in crop pests and
non-native species will help establish why some species
rapidly move onto new hosts, and help determine which
ecological characteristics predict this ability, providing
red ags for monitoring pest invasions.Funding:

CambridgeU TransmissibleCancers
Transmissible Cancer Group, Prof Elizabeth Murchi-
son University of Cambridge Department of Veterinary
Medicine Research Assistant / Research Associate - Evo-
lution of transmissible cancers
Limit of Tenure: 36 months.
The Transmissible Cancer Group at the University of
Cambridge, Department of Veterinary Medicine, is seek-
ing to appoint a Research Assistant or Postdoctoral
Research Associate to join a dynamic team studying the
evolution and host interactions of transmissible cancers
in dogs and Tasmanian devils. This is a xed-term
3-year position supported by a Wellcome research grant.
This post is expected to start on 1st May 2022 but there
is some exibility for an earlier or later start date.
Transmissible cancers are long-lived clonal lineages of
malignant cells that operate as infectious parasites,
spreading between individuals by the physical transfer
of living cancer cells. Among mammals, such diseases
have been described in only two species: dogs and Tas-
manian devils, and are spread by mating and biting,
respectively. These extraordinary cell lineages provide
an opportunity to study cancer evolution over the long-
term, and to investigate the interaction between cancer
cells and the allogeneic immune system. Furthering our
knowledge of these diseases may also shed light on their
transmission dynamics and inform conservation work.
This position is suited for someone with skills in com-
putational biology and an interest in cancer evolution
and tumour immunology. The role-holder will analyse
genome, transcriptome and single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) data from tumours belonging to transmissi-
ble cancer lineages. We will annotate genetic variants16 EvolDir February 1, 2022
and use these to understand past and ongoing muta-
tional and evolutionary processes, including the impact
of mutation on gene expression and tumour phenotypes.
Using scRNAseq data, we will seek to understand the
contribution of host cells to the tumour microenviron-
ment. By integrating data from hundreds of tumours,
our goal will be to understand how cancers exploit a
transmissible niche, and how the interaction between
cancer and immune system controls disease outcome.
Applicants should hold a Masters degree (Research As-
sistant) or PhD (Postdoctoral Research Associate) in
computational biology or a related discipline, and expe-
rience in genome analysis is preferable. The candidate
must value teamwork and collaboration, have good or-
ganisational and interpersonal skills, and should be able
to eectively manage their time. They will have the
opportunity to make their own original contribution to
the eld of study within the framework of the project.
If applying at the Research Assistant level it may be
possible for the role-holder to register as a PhD student.
More information about the Transmissible Can-
cer Group can be found on our website at
www.tcg.vet.cam.ac.uk, and information about the De-
partment of Veterinary Medicine can be found at
www.vet.cam.ac.uk. Informal enquiries should be di-
rected to Prof Elizabeth Murchison (epm27@cam.ac.uk),
and enquiries about the application process should
be directed to Deborah Collett (dc748@cam.ac.uk).
Further particulars for the role can be accessed at
www.vet.cam.ac.uk . Applicants should submit a
CHRIS/6, CV, covering letter outlining suitability for
the role and contact details for two referees. Please note
that shortlisted candidates will be expected to make a
presentation at interview.
Please ensure that you upload your Curriculum Vitae
(CV) and a covering letter in the Upload section of the
online application. Any additional documents, which
have not been requested, will not be considered as part
of your application.

RiceGenDiversityAdaptation
Characterising rice genetic diversity in the Mekong Delta
to sustain future crops
This project is based in the Jose De Vega Group at
the Earlham Institute and the Rafal Gutaker Group at
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
Project Summary Rice is a versatile carbohydrate es-
sential to diets worldwide and a staple for over 50% of
the human population. Rice production in Vietnam is
of enormous value, both as an export commodity and a
daily food staple for more than 96 million people in Viet-
nam. However, climate change is threatening rice's wide
availability. In Vietnam, the highest rice production
areas are in the low-lying deltas of the Mekong and Red
rivers which are particularly exposed to drought and
increased salinity from seawater due to climate change.
Plant genetic resources provide the reservoir of adap-
tive and productive genes free of deleterious mutations
needed to develop the improved cultivars that help en-
sure future crop production. Vietnam's rice diversity
constitutes a signicant and precious genetic resource.
The highly productive Mekong Delta is a cultural and
agricultural hotspot in Southeast Asia, where a unique
and rich diversity of rice landraces developed through
centuries (Gutaker et al. 2020; Higgins et al. 2021a).
These locally adapted and inherited rice varieties con-
stitute a highly valuable genetic resource for breeders
to address increasing threats from climate change in
the Mekong Delta. However, the growing adoption for
high-yielding rice varieties in the Mekong Delta in the
last ve decades has driven the progressive replacement
of locally adapted landraces.
This PhD aims to understand better the changes in rice
genetic diversity in the region and the extent of potential
genetic erosion from the loss of adapted local landraces.
The student will quantify the genetic diversity in local
landraces and admixed accessions, investigate their ge-
netic make-up, and quantify deleterious mutations that
hinder the further improvement of rice and its adap-
tation to future climates. The introduction and later
widespread displacement of local landraces left us with
a limited understanding of the extent of loss in genetic
diversity and adaptive potential available to breeders in
admixed elite varieties that retain local adaption.February 1, 2022 EvolDir 17
The project will be based at De Vega's lab at the Earl-
ham Institute (Y1 and Y2) and Gutaker's group at RBG
Kew (Y3 and Y4). The combined expertise across the
team will provide mentorship and guidance in genomic
and bioinformatic approaches to the study of plant di-
versity and evolution. The student will have access to
Earlham Institute's and RGB Kew's state-of-art high-
performance computing, horticultural infrastructure,
herbarium and seed collections.

3 years PhD studentship: Does behaviour drive evolu-

Supervisors:|Dr Isabella Capellini|&|Dr Domhnall
Jennings|(Queen's University Belfast, UK) Although
behaviour is believed to be an agent of selection, few
studies have demonstrated that behaviour can drive evo-
lution. This project will test whether behaviour drives
evolution focusing on social conict in the context of
reproduction. Reproductive traits, such as the struc-
ture of the mammalian placenta, are highly diverse,
evolve rapidly and are supposed to be a major target
of selection caused by dierent forms of social conict
- parent-ospring conict, sibling competition and sex-
ual conict. The project will exploit diversity among
species and take advantage of state of the art phylo-
genetic comparative methods to investigate whether
behaviour drives rapid evolutionary change in reproduc-
tive traits at large comparative scale.

RMIT Classication: Trusted
Our lab is seeking a highly motivated student to un-
dertake a fully funded three-year PhD project through
RMIT University (Melbourne, Australia) .
PROJECT TITLE: Evolutionary drivers of niche dy-
namics in invasive weeds
BACKGROUND: Many invasive species are known to
exploit novel ecological niches, which are not part of their
ancestral niches. When and why do invasive populations
expand their niches? This project explores ecological
and evolutionary hypotheses of niche expansion in in-
vasive capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) in Australia.
The invasive Australian capeweed is broadly distributed
from wet southern coast to dry inland. We found, so
far, that the capeweed populations are adapted to their
local aridity environments, and that they have genet-
ically diverged in several morphological, phenological,
physiological and chemical traits that mediate drought
resistance. This capeweed system is highly amenable to
manipulative experiments in the eld and greenhouse,
and provides an ideal opportunity to explore a range of
questions related to adaptation in novel environments,
including: 1) Does aridity drive parallel patterns of cli-
nal divergence between native and invasive populations?
2) Does local adaptation drive niche shifts in the invasive
range? 3) Do invasive populations have adaptive (evo-
lutionary) potential for further niche expansion? The
PhD project may involve: 1) eld seed collection, 2)
greenhouse and eld transplant experiments, 3) plant
physiology and chemical analyses, 4) quantitative genet-
ics analyses, and 5) molecular analyses.
Applicants should have research experience equivalent
to research honours or masters with a rst-class grade to
be eligible. A strong background in evolutionary biology
and ability to work independently in the eld setting
is desirable. The student will be supervised by Akane

Evolution of molluscan adaptations (apply with ref.
#01-21053)
This project will use a series of case studies, from across
the diversity of Mollusca, to assess the role of the biomin-
eralization toolkit in phenotypic evolution. A funded
PhD student will be trained in specialist lab techniques
to describe the anatomy of the focal species, visualised
using 3D techniques. These descriptive studies will pro-
vide a new comparative context to interpret the function
of special structures and adaptive novelties. The PhD
project will focus on morphology, but combined with
collaborative phylogenomic analyses from other work
in our research group, to test the phylogenetic place-
ment of these target species with novel body plans, and
related \normal" groups.
Phylogenetic systematics of polyplacophoran molluscs
(apply with ref. # 01-21056)
The aims of this project are to improve taxon sampling
for molecular phylogenetic analysis of total-group Poly-
placophora, to conduct a systematic revision of a major
clade within the class based on phylogenetic analyses
supported by morphological diagnoses, and to describe
new species using an integrative approach combining
molecular and morphological data. The molecular as-
pects will be conducted in collaboration with colleagues
from the LOEWE Translational Biodiversity Genomics
center, using cutting edge techniques especially to gather
data from historical museum samples.
Diversity of deep-sea holothurians (apply with ref. #01-
21058)
Although namako are frequently seen in video footage
captured by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) con-
trolled from deep sea research vessels, they are often20 EvolDir February 1, 2022
dicult to identify reliably. It is not clear how large
the natural ranges are for these species, with some re-
cent evidence indicating that species may be distributed
worldwide, in contrast to the typical pattern of region-
ally segregated species complexes. With this project,
deep sea holothurians (class Holothuria) will be stud-
ied using a combination of genome sequencing, DNA
barcoding, and morpho-anatomical descriptions. This
project will draw on material from the IceAGE and
IceDIVA cruises and the research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr Saskia Brix-Elrig and other col-
leagues at Senckenberg am Meer based in Hamburg and
Wilhelmshaven.

Applications are invited for a PhD fellow-
ship/scholarship at Graduate School of Technical
Sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark, within the
Ecoscience programme. The position is available from 1
May 2022 or later.
Title Plant Evolutionary Ecology: How plant chemicals
aect plants response to climate change
Research area and project description A three-year PhD
position in plant evolutionary ecology is available at De-
partment of Ecoscience (ECOS) section for Terrestrial
Ecology with an expected start 1st of May 2022.
The PhD will work on adaptation in aromatic plants,
and study the importance of plants chemical variation
for tolerance and adaptation to climate stress. Mediter-
ranean aromatic plants show spatial variation in the
chemical composition of their essential oil. This vari-
ation is associated with variation in temperature and
drought stress. The PhD project will test whether spe-
cic chemical phenotypes confer adaptation to these
abiotic environments, and in turn how variation in local
abiotic conditions acts as selective agent for maintaining
spatial variation in chemical phenotypes. The project
consists of performing experimental work in the green-
house, and in the lab at AU, and includes eldwork in
the Mediterranean region. In addition, based on the
experimental results the PhD will work on climatic niche
modelling in collaboration with international partners
(I. Chuine, CNRS, Montpellier). The PhD is part of a
larger project (AromAdapt) funded by the Independent
Research Fund Denmark (DFF).
Who we are The Department of Ecoscience is engaged in
research programmes, teaching and advisory work cov-
ering the major biological subdisciplines. We conduct
world-class research in the areas of ecology, biodiversity
and conservation biology, arctic environment and ecosys-
tems, and aquatic biology. The Department currently
employs approximately 275 academic and technical sta,
as well as many PhD students.
The PhD will work at the Section Terrestrial Ecology.
This section is composed of sta doing research and
teachings on both fundamental and applied research.
They also consult for the Danish Ministry of Environ-February 1, 2022 EvolDir 23

EvolutionInfectionsBirds
PhD position on Ecology of Borrelia infections in
wild birds, Evolutionary Ecology Group, University of
Antwerp
A crucial factor to predict the persistence and spread of
infections in natural systems (and potential spill-over to
humans) is the capacity of reservoir hosts to maintain
the infection and transmit it to others. This is known
to vary greatly between species, but also within species
and through time, although this part of the variation
is often less well understood. Great tits are among the
most important reservoirs of Borrelia garinii, a major
causal agent of Lyme disease. In this project you will
study how the capacity of birds to transmit these bacte-
ria to their tick vectors varies between individuals birds,
how it varies through the annual cycle, and whether
stressful episodes may reactivate infections. This will
be done through a combination of targeted eld and
lab experiments using birds from an intensively studied
wild population. Infection status will be determined by
xenodiagnosis (capacity of the bird to infect naive ticks)
and molecular diagnoses.
You will work in the Evolutionary Ecology group that
has strong expertise in studying ecology of infections in
wild vertebrates and oers a dynamic and international
working environment (www.uantwerpen.be/eveco). We
seek applicants with a Master degree in Biology, Biomed-
ical Science, Veterinary Science or a related eld, with
a basic background in ecological concepts, and a strong
interest in studying the ecology of infections in a nat-
ural system. Experience with handling animals is an
advantage but not strictly required. You are willing to
combine intensive eldwork with lab-based experimental
work and data analysis.
We oer a doctoral scholarship for an initial one-year
period. Following a positive evaluation, this will be re-
newed for an additional three years. The planned start
date is 1 April 2022 or as soon as possible after that date.
You are supervised by a multidisciplinary team includ-
ing Prof. Erik Matthysen (University of Antwerp), Dr.
Dieter Heylen (Institute for Tropical Medicine, Antwerp)
and Dr. Hein Sprong (RIVM, Netherlands).24 EvolDir February 1, 2022

Application for PhD scholarship on Avian Personality
and Infection Ecology
Erik Matthysen, University of Antwerp
Our research group has studied host-tick-pathogen in-
teractions for 15 years, with a particular focus on the
biology of bird-associated ticks and the contribution of
wild birds to transmission ecology of Borrelia, the agent
of Lyme Disease. In a new project starting in 2022 we
will monitor infections with Borrelia in a wild popula-
tion of great tits, combining intensive eld work with
targeted lab experiments. Primary questions include
the drivers of individual variation in Borrelia infections
in birds, and factors causing temporal relapses of in-
fectiousness in birds. This project oers an excellent
opportunity to further investigate the role of bird be-
haviour including personality, which we have studied
intensively in previous projects in the same study popu-
lation.
We therefore are looking for candidates interested in
applying for an externally funded PhD scholarship on
the link between bird behaviour and infections with
ticks and tick-borne pathogens, notably Borrelia garinii.
The candidate should be willing to prepare an extensive
proposal to be submitted to the FWO Research Coun-
cil (www.fwo.be) with a deadline of March 1st 2022.
The selection will be done by FWO and if successful,
the four-year scholarship will start on November 1st
2022. Candidates should have a strong background in
behavioural ecology or evolutionary ecology, preferably
with experience or extensive knowledge on personality
research and/or ecology of infections in wild populations.

The Behavioural Ecology and Ecophysiology research
group (Department of Biology, University of Antwerp,
Belgium) is looking for a full-time (4 year) doctoral
scholarship holder in the eld of Behavioural Ecology.
Position * Project description: Aggression and signalsused during aggressive competition (e.g. song, orna-
ments...) have historically been considered as character-
istics of male animals. Conversely, female competitive
traits are understudied even though there is increasing
evidence that they are common across a wide variety
of taxa. Using nest box populations of individually-
marked free-living songbirds (great and/or blue tits),
the aim of this PhD is to study the costs and benets of
female competitive trait expression within a life-history
and behavioural syndrome framework. Observational
and experimental approaches will be used to link ag-
gressive traits (including song) to reproductive tness
and survival, and/or to study proximate mechanisms
underlying variation in aggressive traits.
Prole * You hold a Master degree recognized by the
EU (or you will have obtained it by the time you start
to work) in Biology (by preference) or in Biomedical or
Veterinary Sciences (provided you have a strong back-
ground in behaviour, ecology and evolution). * You
can demonstrate excellent study results. * You have
excellent writing and communication skills; excellent
command of written and spoken English is mandatory.

use these data to reconstruct colors and color patterns
of fossil mammals while addressing hypotheses aboutthe diversication of melanosomes and melanin-based
color. The student will likely learn and/or use electron
and light microscopy, chemical analyses (Raman and
mass spectrometry, etc.), spectrophotometry, phyloge-
netic and/or optical modeling. We encourage anyone
with an interest in multidisciplinary research to apply,
including those trained in elds outside biology. The
position will be based in Ghent, but will involve some
time at Naturalis and, if Covid allows, trips to China for
collaboration with our palaeontologist colleagues. The

Research Project / Research Group Description
Vocalizations in many species are learned behaviours
acquired based on auditory experiences early in life.
Although many questions about the evolution of vocal
learning could be better addressed with knowledge of the
genetic changes driving vocal dierences among individ-
uals and species, a complete chain of causality between
gene and phenotype has rarely been achieved. This
project aims to identify genes controlling the geneticpredisposition of individuals for learning and produc-
ing specic vocalizations by exploiting variation exis-
tent in articially selected canaries that exhibit distinct
songs. To map phenotype onto genotype, the candidate
will apply an integrative approach applied to breeds
of domesticated canaries that leverages techniques and
expertise in the elds of genome sciences, animal be-
haviour, and neurobiology. The approach is divided in
four aims: (1) phenotypic analyses of brain and song
to elucidate the nature of the observed dierences in
vocal behaviour of breeds under study; (2) genetic map-
ping using population genomics and pedigrees generated
using laboratory crosses to identify genomic regions un-
derlying these dierences; (3) molecular and functional
genomic tools for experimental validation and identi-
cation of specic genes/mutations; and (4) comparative
genomics to assess evidence for adaptive convergent evo-
lution among several clades of vocal learners, including
humans, either at the protein and regulatory levels. The
proposed research therefore provides a unique opportu-
nity to identify networks of genes controlling dierences
in vocal learning behaviour and can signicantly expand
our understanding of complex and fascinating biological
phenomena such as birdsong and human speech. The
candidate will be integrated in the Evolutionary Genet-
ics and Genomic group (EVOLGEN) at CIBIO, which
brings together people broadly interested in the genetic
determinants underlying phenotypic diversity in nature,
including learned behaviours.
| Job position description
The candidate will be a part of an international collab-
orative group, which includes the EVOLGEN group at
CIBIO led by Dr. Miguel Carneiro, Dr. Malgorzata
Gazda (Department of Genomes & Genetics, Institute
Pasteur), and Dr. Tracy Larson (Department of Biology,
University of Virginia) The team members, recognized
specialists in evolutionary biology and neurobiology, will
supervise the process of learning and applying of state-
of-the-art genomic tools and behavioural assays in order
to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of song pheno-
types. The PhD student will be mostly involved in
applying functional genomic tools to establish explicit
genotype/phenotype associations with a high standard
of evidence and to unravel specic molecular mecha-
nisms driving vocal behaviour divergence. Many re-
sources have been already generated in the lab, including
improved, chromosome level reference genome and an-
notation, together with the whole-genome resequencing
data, will be used to screen candidate genes (e.g. genes
implicated in motor learning and the development of neu-
ronal circuits) and potential causative mutations (single
nucleotide polymorphisms, small indels, and structural
variants). The PhD student will help to conduct exper-February 1, 2022 EvolDir 29
iments that allow for an in-depth investigation of the
functional impact of genes or mutations. Depending
on the nature of the ndings, experiments will include
a variety of techniques to assess gene expression (In
Situ Hybridization, Immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq),
identication of tissue-specic regulatory elements and
assessment of cis-regulatory activity (ChiP-seq, ATAC-
seq, CRE-seq), and enzymatic assays for evaluating bio-
chemical function. In this way, we aim to map genotype
onto cellular and molecular phenotype. The student is
expected to contribute towards results communication
in form of oral presentation

Project Description It is now well documented that
related species often exchange genetic material in thewild. Interspecic genetic introgression is thus a po-
tentially important player in biodiversity evolution, yet
poorly quantied and characterised. Modern genomics
oers unprecedented opportunities to ll this gap and
address several questions of great importance for our
understanding of evolution: under what conditions does
introgression occur, what is the role of natural selection
in promoting or impeding it, and the origin selection?
The project will focus on three species of south European
hares (genus Lepus) that were aected by introgression
from an arctic/boreal species that they replaced in this
region during the current deglaciation. Analysing a
collection of full genome sequences and additional popu-
lation genetics data, this project will aim to detect and
quantify all factors modulating introgression, related
for example with sex-linked transmission and behaviour,
the interplay between recombination rate variation and
genetic incompatibilities, positive natural selection, and
coadaptation between genomic regions. This project
will allow the acquisition of skills in bioinformatics and
sophisticated cutting-edge population and evolution-
ary genomics, by handling large-scale genomic datasets.
This work is expected to have a general impact on the un-
derstanding of speciation and evolution through genetic
exchange, broadening our understanding of biodiversity
beyond species inventories.

UppsalaU Comparativegenomics
A PhD student position in evolutionary genetics is avail-
able at the Department of Ecology and Genetics, Evo-
lutionary Biology.
The Department of Ecology and Genetics is an inter-
national environment with sta and students from all
over the world. Our research spans from evolutionary
ecology and genetics to studies of ecosystems. For more
information, see www.ieg.uu.se . The Evolutionary Bi-
ology Centre (http://www.ebc.uu.se/?languageId=1) is
one of the world's leading research institutions in evolu-
tionary biology. It is part of Uppsala University, which
has been ranked very high among all European Univer-
sities in the subject of evolutionary biology. Our lab
is part of the Program of Evolutionary Biology that
excels in many aspects of genetics and evolution and
oers an inspiring international atmosphere. There are
ample opportunities for interaction with PhD-students,
PostDocs and researchers working on related topics.
We are tightly linked to the Science for Life Laboratory
(https://www.scilifelab.se/) and have access to advanced
laboratory infrastructure, high performance computing
resources and bioinformatics support.
Project description/duties: Phenotypic plasticity is one
of the most important mechanisms used by plants and
animals for adapting to changing environmental con-
ditions and thus of major evolutionary interests. This
project will combine eldwork, laboratory experiments
and comparative transcriptomic work and functional
assays (using RNAi) to study how photoperiod aects
plasticity in wing polyphenism in dierent species of
waterstriders. Waterstriders are a well-known group
of insects that show wing polymorphism both between
species as well as within species, and plasticity is largely
due to variation in photoperiod. Several dierent species
of waterstriders will be studied and nymphs raised in
the laboratory during dierent photoperiod for sampling
of transcriptomic information followed by RNA seq ana-
lyzes to identify dierentially expressed genes. Genetic
crossing experiments as well as articial selection ex-
periments will also be set up to investigate inheritance
patterns under dierent environmental conditions. Func-
tional genetic work on dierentially expressed genes of
interests will be performed using established RNAi pro-tocols developed and optimized for waterstriders. The
overall goal of the project is to identify the gene regula-
tory network that is responsible for wing polyphenism
and how it interacts with photoperiod and how this has
allowed plasticity in wing development to evolve in the
dierent species. The PhD student position includes
research, courses and literature studies.
Qualications required: To be eligible for a PhD-student
position the applicant must hold a master degree (or
equivalent) in evolutionary biology, cell and molecular
biology or developmental biology or related elds. Can-
didates must be able to express themselves uently in
spoken as well as written English.
Qualications desired: The ideal candidate is highly
motivated and enthusiastic about evolutionary biology,
particularly in population genomics and/or developmen-
tal biology. Experience with bioinformatic analysis and
programming is advantageous.
Type of employment: Temporary position according
to the Higher Education Ordinance chapter 5  c 7.
The graduate program covers four years of full-time
study. The position can be combined with teaching
or other duties at the department (maximum 20%),
which prolongs the employment with the correspond-
ing time. The salary will be set according to local
agreements. Rules governing PhD candidates are set
out in the Higher Education Ordinance Chapter 5,

EcoEvolutionMicrobeEukaryotes
A PhD student position is open in the lab of Fabien
Burki at the Department of Organismal Biology, Upp-
sala University (Sweden).
Multidisciplinary project in marine microbiology with
emphasis on symbiosis
See full description and how to apply here: https:/-
/uu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:464881/type:job/-
where:4/apply:1 Closing date: February 14, 2022
Project description: The position is associated with
an ongoing project on characterising an enigmatic
marine endosymbiosis in the micro-eukaryote genus
Meringosphaera. These are single-celled eukaryotes that
are globally distributed and are considered photosyn-
thetic based on consistent observations of autouores-
cent 'green bodies' and absence of feeding behaviours.
Interestingly, we recently showed that Meringosphaera
belongs to the group of heterotrophic protists centrohe-
lids. The overarching goals of this four-year PhD project
are to identify the closest free-living relatives to the en-
dosymbionts, and to characterize the levels of cellular,
genetic, and metabolic integration of the endosymbionts
to pinpoint the nature of this endosymbiosis. A suite of
single cell methods will be employed, including single-
cell genomics and metagenomics, as well as confocal
scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
and focused ion beam-secondary electron microscopy
(FIB-SEM). The position is based in the laboratory of
Fabien Burki at IOB at Uppsala University, but includes
a strong collaborative component with the laboratory
of Rachel Foster at Stockholm University and the lab
of Tom Delmont in Paris.
Duties: The position involves sampling, cell isolation,
imaging with advanced microscopy, and attempts for
cultivation of Meringosphaera cells in enrichment cul-
tures. Additionally, managing the sample preparations
for single cell genomics, and a strong bioinformatic com-
ponent, will be required. Training will be provided when
necessary.
Requirements: Completed university education of 240
university points (h ogskolepo ang, hp) out of which 60
hp on advanced level corresponding to master degreein relevant eld to the project. The selected candi-
date must possess expertise and knowledge in microbial
sampling as well as identifying and handling small eu-
karyotic plankton. Experience in culturing of microbial
eukaryotes, background in eukaryotic diversity and pho-
tosymbiosis will be seen as highly valuable. A suite of
methodologies will be used as described in the project
description and are desirable attributes of the candidate.
In particular, proven expertise in bioinformatics (e.g.
phylogeny, genomics) and use of a scripting language
(Python, R) are essential. Great emphasis is placed on
personal qualities such as planning and organizational
skills, high-motivation, problem solving and good collab-
orations and communication skills with other researchers.
The applicant must have documented experience and
prociency in oral and written presentation in English.
Additional qualications: In lling this position, the
university aims to recruit the person who, in the com-
bined evaluation of competence, skills and documented
qualications, is judged most suitable to carry out and
develop the work-in-hand and to contribute to a positive
development of the department.
Application: The application should include 1) a letter
of intent describing yourself, your research interests and
motivation of why you want to do a PhD, 2) a short
description of your education, 3) a CV, 4) a copy of
your master degree and course grades, 5) the names and
contact information (address, email address, and phone
number) of at least two reference persons, 6) relevant
publications (including master thesis). The application
should be written in English.

USaskatchewan SquirrelLifeHistory
M.Sc. or Ph.D. position on integrative biology of wild
hibernating Columbian ground squirrels.
I am currently advertising one graduate student (either
M.Sc. or Ph.D.) opening in the Evo-Eco-Energetics Lab
(PI: Dr. Jerey Lane) in the Department of Biology,
at the University of Saskatchewan. Start dates of May
or September, 2022 are possible, with an earlier start
being preferred. There is also the potential for a stu-
dent to complete a eld season as part of the eld crew
prior to enrolling in the graduate program at the UofS.
The student will need to be successful in either external
(e.g., NSERC post-graduate scholarships for Canadian
citizens) or internal funding competitions (scholarship
or teaching assistantship).
The Project: Integrative biology of hibernating
Columbian ground squirrels.
Since 2008, we have been developing a wild population
of hibernating Columbian ground squirrels in Alberta's
Rocky Mountains as a system in which to integrate
energetic physiology, ecology and evolutionary biology.
Individuals in this population hibernate for 8-9 months
each year, and we have learned that hibernation is phe-
notypically plastic, heritable and associated with tness.
Current, graduate student-led, work on the project is
investigating energy allocation to reproduction, abiotic
(e.g., weather) and biotic (e.g., food abundance) inu-
ences on hibernation biology, and between-population
variation in energetics and phenology. We are excited
to advance these lines of investigation over the coming
years, and are looking to recruit at least one student
with interests in: climate change biology, evolutionary
ecology, life history evolution and/or energetic physiol-
ogy.
To support this project, the student will have access
to dedicated research infrastructure, including a mo-
bile laboratory trailer (housing a quantitative mag-
netic resonance analyzer (to measure body composition)
and a eld portable respirometry system (to measure
metabolic rates), necessary eld equipment (e.g., live
traps and handling equipment). We have recently re-
ned protocols for individual food-supplementation, en-
abling targeted feeding experiment. The student will
have access to those protocols and equipment. The
student will also have full access to the 14 year data
set to address their research questions. All eldworkwill be based out of the University of Calgary's R.B.
Miller Research Station (https://research.ucalgary.ca/-
biogeoscience-institute/facilities/rb-miller-station).
The successful applicant will have a GPA 80 % (con-
verted to the UofS' 1-100% scale) over the past two
years of schooling, and a degree in a relevant discipline
(e.g., ecology, environmental biology, physiology, evo-
lutionary biology or zoology). In addition, a passion
for eldwork, wildlife ecology, and academic research as
well as excellent scientic communication skills (both
written and oral), statistical prociency (or a willingness
to gain it) and the ability to work productively as a
member of a team (both in the eld and oce) is neces-
sary. Evidence of scientic productivity (manuscripts
published or in preparation, conference attendance and
presentations) will be viewed favourably. This position
is open to both Canadian and international students.
We believe equity, diversity, and inclusion strengthen
the community and enhance excellence, innovation and
creativity. We, therefore, encourage members of the
underrepresented groups in STEM (e.g., women, In-
digenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, members of
visible minorities, and diverse sexual orientation and
gender identities) to apply.
If you are interested in applying, please submit a cv
(including names and contact details of references), a
short ( 1 pg) description of research interests and a
copy of your transcripts to (unocial or ocial) to Jef-
frey.lane@usask.ca. Applications will be evaluated as
they're received. To ensure full consideration of your ap-
plication, therefore, please submit ASAP. Any questions
can also be directed to the same email address.
Thank you in advance for your interest in this position,
however, only those selected for an interview will be
contacted.

New PhD Position: Evolutionary genomics of butter-
ies in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Please, feel free
to distribute to all potential candidates) Closing date:
February 28, 2022
You will be part of an exciting research project study-34 EvolDir February 1, 2022
ing species diversication and distributional patterns
of Lepidoptera (butteries and moths) of the Brazilian
Atlantic Forest. The goal of the PhD position is to
infer macroevolutionary drivers of extant ecological pat-
terns along altitude and latitude, and to test competing
hypotheses for understanding parapatric speciation on
tropical mountain ranges.
You will generate new data using whole-genome rese-
quencing to infer species-level phylogenies and to com-
pute metrics of genomic regions of divergence between
parapatric, sister species. It is expected that this frame-
work will allow you to test the roles of abiotic factors
(temperature, altitudinal gradients) in shaping the ex-
tant species and genetic diversity of butteries in a
tropical biodiversity hotspot.
Priority will be given to candidates who have co-
authored at least one scientic publication (including
submitted and accepted manuscripts). Experience with
molecular phylogenetics, population genetics and/or
analysis of high-throughput DNA sequencing data using
bioinformatic pipelines is advantageous.
The results will be part of a larger multidisciplinary
research aiming at determining the evolutionary mecha-
nisms that shaped current Lepidoptera biodiversity pat-
terns (centers of endemism and species richness) in the
Atlantic Forest. This is a bilateral research project that

PhD position; Fruit y evolutionary ecology, Hawkes-
bury Institute for the Environment, Western SydneyUniversity, Australia
One PhD scholarship is available for a highly motivated
and enthusiastic candidate to investigate life history
traits of Queensland fruit y (Qy) from both ecological
and evolutionary perspectives. Qy is Australia's most
signicant horticultural pest. Pupation and complete
metamorphosis are key evolutionary innovations of in-
sects, with massive changes in morphology, physiology,
microbiomes and behaviour. In nature, late instar Qy
larvae leave infested fruit and pupate in the soil from
where adult ies emerge. In the soil, individuals are
exposed to many biotic (e.g. pathogens) and abiotic (e.g.
suocation) challenges. Knowledge about Qy pupation
biology and ecology is scarce. For SIT, mass-rearing
requires a pupation substrate, optimal environmental
conditions and careful processing of pupae. This project
will study Qy pupation biology and ecology in natu-
ral environments, assess optimal densities and climatic
conditions in controlled environments, and test dierent
pupation substrates to evaluate their impact on Qy
life history traits, performance and health.
The PhD project is based at the Hawkesbury campus of
Western Sydney University in Richmond (NSW) in the
Sydney Basin and at the foothills of the Blue Mountains.
Our collaborating partners are Primary Industries and
Regions South Australia (PIRSA), the national SIT
Qy facility in Port Augusta and other research part-
ners. Since its foundation HIE has rapidly built a strong
research reputation in ecology and evolution, and a vi-
brant team of over 50 academic research scientists and
80 PhD students with access to a unique suite of world-
class research facilities and laboratories.

TransmissibleCancer
Transmissible Cancer Group, Prof Elizabeth Murchi-
son University of Cambridge Department of Veterinary
Medicine Research Assistant / Research Associate - Evo-
lution of transmissible cancers
Limit of Tenure: 36 months.
The Transmissible Cancer Group at the University of
Cambridge, Department of Veterinary Medicine, is seek-
ing to appoint a Research Assistant or Postdoctoral
Research Associate to join a dynamic team studying the
evolution and host interactions of transmissible cancers
in dogs and Tasmanian devils. This is a xed-term
3-year position supported by a Wellcome research grant.
This post is expected to start on 1st May 2022 but there
is some exibility for an earlier or later start date.
Transmissible cancers are long-lived clonal lineages of
malignant cells that operate as infectious parasites,
spreading between individuals by the physical transfer
of living cancer cells. Among mammals, such diseases
have been described in only two species: dogs and Tas-
manian devils, and are spread by mating and biting,
respectively. These extraordinary cell lineages provide
an opportunity to study cancer evolution over the long-
term, and to investigate the interaction between cancer
cells and the allogeneic immune system. Furthering our
knowledge of these diseases may also shed light on their
transmission dynamics and inform conservation work.
This position is suited for someone with skills in com-
putational biology and an interest in cancer evolution
and tumour immunology. The role-holder will analyse
genome, transcriptome and single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) data from tumours belonging to transmissi-
ble cancer lineages. We will annotate genetic variants
and use these to understand past and ongoing muta-
tional and evolutionary processes, including the impact
of mutation on gene expression and tumour phenotypes.
Using scRNAseq data, we will seek to understand thecontribution of host cells to the tumour microenviron-
ment. By integrating data from hundreds of tumours,
our goal will be to understand how cancers exploit a
transmissible niche, and how the interaction between
cancer and immune system controls disease outcome.
Applicants should hold a Masters degree (Research As-
sistant) or PhD (Postdoctoral Research Associate) in
computational biology or a related discipline, and expe-
rience in genome analysis is preferable. The candidate
must value teamwork and collaboration, have good or-
ganisational and interpersonal skills, and should be able
to eectively manage their time. They will have the
opportunity to make their own original contribution to
the eld of study within the framework of the project.
If applying at the Research Assistant level it may be
possible for the role-holder to register as a PhD student.
More information about the Transmissible Can-
cer Group can be found on our website at
www.tcg.vet.cam.ac.uk, and information about the De-
partment of Veterinary Medicine can be found at
www.vet.cam.ac.uk. Informal enquiries should be di-
rected to Prof Elizabeth Murchison (epm27@cam.ac.uk),
and enquiries about the application process should
be directed to Deborah Collett (dc748@cam.ac.uk).
Further particulars for the role can be accessed at
www.vet.cam.ac.uk . Applicants should submit a
CHRIS/6, CV, covering letter outlining suitability for
the role and contact details for two referees. Please note
that shortlisted candidates will be expected to make a
presentation at interview.
Please ensure that you upload your Curriculum Vitae
(CV) and a covering letter in the Upload section of the
online application. Any additional documents, which
have not been requested, will not be considered as part
of your application.
Closing date 25 February 2022 Interviews will be held
on 16 March 2022

Pathogens Directory of Pathogen Biorepository
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
(EEB) and the Michigan Center for Infectious Disease
Threats (MCIDT) invite applications for a full-time
tenured or tenure-track position at the intersection
of ecology, evolution, and epidemiology of zoonotic
pathogens. The anticipated start date will be August 29,
2022. The successful applicant will maintain a thriving
research program and serve as the Director of a new
Pathogen Biorepository (M-PABI). M-PABI is part of

disease ecology and evolution, relationships between
environmental health, host biodiversity and epidemiol-
ogy, host-pathogen interactions, and related areas. We
specically seek individuals with strengths in developing
research coordination networks, acquiring and utilizing
collections-based pathogen surveillance data, and quan-
titative methods for integrating such data with models
for monitoring and predicting zoonotic emergence. Suc-
cessful applicants will present a clear vision for the role
of the new biorepository in studying emerging infectious
diseases. The successful candidate, as a member of the
EEB Museums, will have opportunities for curation and
research using world-class biodiversity collections in a
modern facility.

seeking a Research Assistant to join the Blaxter group
in the Tree of Life programme to work in our nematode
and meiofaunal genomics team. You will join a friendly
and productive group working on the genomics of the
smallest of animals - mostly nematodes, but also other
meiofauna.
About the Team: The Blaxter group is using high vol-
ume genomics to understand the evolution and biology
of a wide range of taxa. One key project is to sequence
to high quality the genomes of hundreds of free living
and parasitic nematodes (roundworms) and other meio-
faunal species. We also work on a wide range of other
animals, plants, fungi and protists.
About the Role: You will be responsible for maintenance
and processing of nematode cultures for genomic anal-
ysis, including many free living taxa and new isolates
from the wild. You will be responsible for shepherding
strains from acquisition through to genome sequencing,
working with others in the team to set priorities and de-
velop procedures. You will participate in wild sampling
of nematodes and other meiofauna.
About you: We are seeking a graduate biologist, good
with their hands in the laboratory - and preferably with
some experience in handling Caenorhabditis or other
nematode cultures - and with an enthusiasm for sci-
ence that can see beyond the detail of the day to day
work in the lab to new discoveries. You will be careful,
meticulous and have a strong work ethic.

Oceanography. Depending on chosen specialization, stu-
dents may learn about DNA extraction and sequencing
and/or how to read and analyze data to characterize
marine environments.
The program may involve hands-on eldwork to investi-
gate coral reefs or to deploy and retrieve oceanographic
instruments while working at the UOG Marine Labo-
ratory. Graduate students will also receive support for
their individual thesis defenses.
The program seeks to increase the number and diversity
of students who choose careers in STEM (Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering, and Mathematics). All qualied
students are encouraged to apply, in particular women,
minorities, and students with disabilities.
The deadline to apply is 5 p.m. CHST on February 18,

Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce a new monthly online semi-
nar series, launching on the 11th of January 2022 . This
series is organised by a Special Topic Network called
\Integration of speciation research" (IOS), funded by the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB). The
network aims to establish a framework for integrative
speciation research, by developing tools for comparative
analyses (e.g. a publicly available speciation database)
and organising activities (seminars, workshops) to fa-
cilitate discussion and knowledge exchange between all
corners of speciation research. More information can be
found on the IOS network website .
The seminar series will centre around the broad aims of
the network, which are: i) To understand the relative
importance of dierent barriers to gene ow and outline
best practices to measure them. ii) To survey the role of
interactions and coupling between barriers in increasing
reproductive isolation. iii) To seek common genomic
patterns underlying barriers as reproductive isolation
increases. iv) To bridge the knowledge gap between
what is known of speciation mechanisms at a microevo-
lutionary scale and the knowledge of speciation rates &
their determinants at a macroevolutionary scale.
The rst instalment of the IOS seminar series aims at
bridging the gap between macroevolutionary patternsand microevolutionary mechanisms, with a focus on big-
ger questions in speciation research. We will welcome
Leonie Moyle (Professor, Department of Biology, Indi-
ana University) and Daniel Matute (Assistant Professor,
Department of Biology, University of North Carolina) as
speakers. The session will take place on 11th of January
2022 at 5 pm CET, lasting 1.5 hours. The rst hour
is dedicated to talks and questions, and the nal 30
minutes is dedicated to a discussion session. To attend
the sessions live, please follow the links below.

Talks (but not discussion sessions) will be recorded and
made available on the IOS .
The IOS network does not only aim at scientic inte-
gration, but also integration of the community. A main
objective on this front is to foster diversity and inclu-
sion across the eld. The seminar series and subsequent
discussion is open to everyone, from students to estab-
lished researchers and non-scientists alike. In order to
maximise the geographic diversity of attendees, we will
alternate between two time slots every other month:
5 pm CET (January) and 8 am CET (February) etc..
Please help us to circulate this email to anyone who
may be interested, especially those in countries that are
typically underrepresented in scientic discourse.
The seminar series programme will be announced by
email, on Twitter (@Speciation net) and on the IOS
network website. People who wish to automatically
receive the programme and other news from the network
can sign up to the IOS network mailing list [ https:/-

and we wish you a very pleasant end to the year in
the meantime. If you have questions, please contact

Sequencing Costs
Dear all,
Recently, the iconic NHGRI plot of sequencing cost since
2000 ( https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-
sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data) got me thinking
about the cost of sequence data acquisition since, say,
1960.
As I understand things, the super-Moore's-Law decline
in sequencing costs starting in 2007 corresponds to the
end of Sanger sequencing for bulk work. But what
about earlier shifts in DNA technology? For example,
what happened when ABI uorescent-labeled ddNTPs
replaced radiolabeled? Ditto Sanger sequencing vis  >1
2
vis RFLPs? RFLPs vs protein sequencing? Did the
(exponential) slope change at those moments as well?
Does anyone have any data on that? Or know where I
might look?
Thank you! Dan Weinreich

CzechAcademy EvolutionaryBiology
Postdoc in Evolutionary Biology: phylogenetic regional-
ization of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot
Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sci-
ences
The position is available from February 2022 to Decem-
ber 2022
Topic: Biogeographic phylogenetic regionalization of the
Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot, using small
mammals as a model animal group.
The goal of the project:
The revolution in phylogenetic systematics has gener-
ated an unprecedently high number of cladograms at
a very ne spatial scale. They can be used to discover
natural \monophyletic" biogeographic areas, which have
great explanatory power as they represent natural re-
gions formed by biological and geological evolutionary
processes (sensu Ebach & Parenti 2015). Recently devel-
oped approaches for the so-called phylogenetic region-
alization (e.g. Daru et al. 2017) can signicantly help
to reveal the spatial and evolutionary structure of bio-
diversity and identify centres of evolutionary radiation,
museums of diversity and extinction hotspots.
The post-doc researcher will use already collected phylo-
genetic/phylogenomic data for phylogenetic regionaliza-
tion of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot.
She/he will follow a widely suggested pipeline, using
genomic trees as the main input data (see Daru et
al. 2017). (i) In the rst step they will quantify the
phylogenetic beta diversity (PBD) - this can be done64 EvolDir February 1, 2022
by a variety of approaches (Leprieur et al. 2012), e.g.
PhyloSor, UniFrac or Simpson ^As phylogenetic index.
Especially the latter is commonly used in biogeographic
regionalization because it is insensitive to dierences
in species richness. (ii) The second step includes the
selection of a clustering algorithm that best describes
the site x site PBD matrix. The performance of par-
ticular algorithms will be evaluated e.g. by using the
cophenetic correlation coecient or Gower ^As distance.
(iii) The last step is the determination of the optimal
number of clusters (bioregions) - we will use more ob-
jective approaches based on transition zones, e.g. the
\elbow" method implemented in R package VEGAN.
Application deadline: 28. January 2022

with diverse scientic expertise and backgrounds, con-
nected by the goal to understand biodiversity. We study
the mechanisms that shape biodiversity patterns across
spatial and temporal scales - in both terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems and their response to global changes.
To make these connections, we collect data through
biological monitoring, environmental DNA methods, re-
mote sensing, and eld sampling, and use these data to
answer questions with statistical and process-based mod-
els of biological diversity. We are further committed to
translating basic science ndings and novel technologies

JagiellonianU AmphibianSpeciation
Postdoc: Jagiellonian University in Krak >1
2w, Poland
Mitonuclear co-adaptation and speciation in amphibians
We seek a motivated PhD interested in pursuing a post-
doc focused on mitonuclear co-adaptation and its role
in amphibian speciation.
Mitochondrial protein complexes involved in aerobic
respiration are encoded in mitochondrial DNA and nu-
clear DNA, a condition necessitating co-adaptation be-
tween the two genomes. Mitonuclear co-adaptation is
broken up by recombination when individuals from di-
vergent lineages (such as dierent species) mate and
produce hybrid progeny. Mitonuclear incompatibilities,
i.e. the mismatch between gene products encoded by
the mtDNA of one species and nDNA of another, may
constitute important postzygotic reproductive barriers.
However, several basic aspects of this potentially uni-
versal reproductive isolation mechanism remain poorly
known. The goal of this project is to evaluate the role
of mitonuclear co-adaptation in amphibian speciation.
The post-doc will participate in attaining one or more
of the following aims of the project: (1) assess the con-
cordance of patterns of sequence divergence in mtDNA-
and nDNA-encoded genes involved in mitochondrial
metabolism across the contact zones of hybridizing am-
phibian species, (2) evaluate the causes of widespread
mtDNA introgression in amphibians, (3) assay the func-
tional and tness consequences of mitonuclear incom-
patibility in tadpoles.
The post-doc will join a team of researchers led by Ma-
ciej Pabijan (http://zap-uj.pl/pabijan en.html) at the
Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research at Jagiel-
lonian University in Krak >1
2w. The position involves
molecular lab work (targeted sequencing), demographic
modelling and participation in an experiment on tadpole
tness and function in relation to mitonuclear discor-
dance. Depending on his/her interests, the candidate
may also contribute to eld work (amphibian sampling)
in Poland and beyond. The project is funded by the
National Science Centre of Poland. The post-doc posi-
tion is for 30 months with a salary of ~7 000 PLN ( ~1
550 Euro) per month, which is reasonable considering
the lower living costs of Krak >1

*Context: *A post-doctoral researcher position is open
at Le Mans University (France) and University Laval
(Qu >1
2bec, Canada). It is to be lled as soon as
possible for a period of one year. This contract is
in support of the European H2020 project \GHaNA"
(http://ghana.univ-lemans.fr/en/index.html ), which
aims at exploring the diversity of diatoms from the
genus/Haslea/and its blue marennine-like pigments.
The postdoctoral research project aims at analyzing
omic data (genomes and transcriptomes) from dier-
ent strains and species of the genus/Haslea/, already
generated in the partner laboratories. The exploitation
of these data will have important outputs at both fun-
damental and application levels (for instance in blue
biotechnology).
*Problematic and objectives: *Diatoms from the genus
/Haslea /are//marine, mostly benthic or epiphytic or-
ganisms. The type species of the genus, /H. ostrearia
/(Gaillon) Simonsen, produces the very specic blue
pigment marennine, responsible for the greening of ma-
rine invertebrates, especially bivalves. So far, the genus
/Haslea/encompasses /ca/. 40 taxa as listed in /Algae-
Base/(Guiry & Guiry 2021) distributed all over the
world, mostly in temperate, waters, but also tropi-
cal as well as polar species. Less than 20% of these
species produce marennine-like blue pigments. There-
fore, /Haslea/is a good model for exploring evolutionar-
ily relevant ecological adaptations of diatoms in general,
as well as adaptation with polar and temperate dis-
tributions. Currently, six /Haslea/species, including
two arctic ones, have been sequenced by both labora-
tories, some of them using a combination of long and
short reads (ONT and Illumina). These sequencing ef-
forts have revealed relatively small genomes, from 60
to 100Mb, with probable high density gene content and
high level of repeats. The aim of this project is to ex-
ploit all available genomic data of /Haslea /species in
order to comprehend adaptation in dierent benthic
and pseudo-benthic environments, in particular between
temperate and polar regions. This will have important
outputs both for fundamental research (diatom genome
evolution, specic biosynthesis pathways) and biotech
applications (strain selection, added value and bioactive
compounds).

LundU Sweden ProtistSymbiosis
DeadlineFeb1
Dear colleagues,
Please see below a brief description of a post-doc posi-
tion to study symbiotic interactions in protists at Lund
University, Sweden.
In the microbial world, symbiotic interactions based on
syntrophy (i.e., a type of mutualistic symbiosis where
nutrients are exchanged between organisms to allow for
metabolic division of labour) are common, especially
between prokaryotic organisms in anoxic environments.
Such interactions are essential drivers of biogeochemi-
cal processes like global carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur
cycling. Whether similar roles can be attributed to
single-cell eukaryotes (protists) occupying these environ-
ments remains unclear owing in large part to our limited
understanding of the biology, syntrophic potential, and
metabolism of anaerobic eukaryotes.
We're looking for a post-doctoral fellow who will de-
velop single-cell sequencing techniques to investigate
the genomic and transcriptomic potential of individual
eukaryotic cells and their resident microbial partners
isolated from anaerobic environments. These data will
be used to approximate metabolic interactions between
the organisms. The candidate will have the opportu-
nity to develop new microscopy techniques to moni-
tor cell:cell interactions in collaboration with with Drs.
Ryan Gawryluk (U. Victoria, Canada) and Edith Ham-
mer (Lund University) as part of an international multi-
disciplinary research initiative
The prospective post-doctoral fellow will be hosted by
Dr. Courtney Stairs with support of the Carl-Tryggers
Stiftelsen in the Biology Department at Lund University,
Sweden.

Duration:
3 years
Postdoctoral position in Bioinformatics (m/f/d)
The Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich is one of
the largest and most renowned universities in Germany.
Working environment:
The established group \Genome Plasticity and Compu-
tational Genetics" managed by Korbinian Schneeberger
is focused on plant genomics, specically on the devel-
opment of novel computational and biotechnological
methods for the analysis of genome sequences. The
group is located at the Faculty of Biology at the LMU
in Munich, with a part of the group working at the
Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in
Cologne, Germany. We are currently searching for a
postdoc for our location at the MPI in Cologne.
Our group analyzes genomic changes on dierent levels.
We compare the genomes between species, populations
and articial crosses. We do this using latest technolo-
gies (including third generation as well as single-cell
genomic technology) to get insights into how and why
genomes change over time. Current projects include
genetic experiments and the establishment of compu-
tational methods for the analysis of multidimensional
genome data to study the natural diversity of mutations
and recombination.
We are a multi-disciplinary group including bioinfor-
maticians, biologists and biotechnologists (schneeberg-
erlab.org). Our approach to science is curiosity-driven,
and is closely aligned to our interests in new genomic
technologies. Scientic support comes from a wide range
of facilities (genomics, microscopy, high performance
compute clusters) and lab technicians. Salaries will
be based on previous experience according to TV-L
guidelines.
Project Description
We have recently developed a new method to assemble
the individual haplotypes of tetraploid genomes based
on the combination of long-read sequencing and the anal-
ysis of single pollen genomes (Sun et al, 2021, biorxiv).
We applied this method for the reconstruction of the
rst fully haplotype-resolved assembly of a cultivated
potato genome.
Following up on this work we now would like to make
use of the individual haplotypes and develop genotypingmethods for a simplied analysis of even more complex
genomes. The method should then be applied to geno-
typing recombinant pollen genomes (which will allow us
to analyze the inheritance on the individual haplotypes)
as well as other potato cultivars. While applied in the
context of plant genomics, such haplotype-type based
genotyping would be applicable across many dierent
species including even humans.
Qualications
We are searching for highly motivated applicants with a
PhD in bioinformatics or a similar eld in computational
biology. Applicants should be procient in programming
(Java, C/C++ etc.) or scripting and should have experi-
ence in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data
and in the use of a high-performance compute cluster.
Good oral and writing skills in English are essential.
We are particularly looking for open-minded, creative
and critical minded candidates who like to work in an
international team.
Disabled people with the appropriate qualications will
be considered preferably.

2-year Postdoc position - Habitat choice evolution in
microcosms
Theoretical and Experimental Ecology Station (SETE,
Moulis, France)
We are welcoming applications for a funded 2-year Post-
doc position beginning around May-June 2022 (start
date exible) as part of the ANR project CHOOSE,
to study the environmental drivers of habitat choice
evolution using ciliate microcosms. The oer will stay
open until the position is lled.
Individuals that choose to leave a habitat to join an-
other are often phenotypically dierent from those that
stay in this habitat. The major consequences of non-
random dispersal decisions that are both phenotype- and
context-dependent have been recently developed under
habitat choice theory. Compared to random dispersal,
this theory predicts that habitat choice based disper-
sal should generate spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes
and thus lead to drastically dierent consequences for
a variety of ecological and evolutionary dynamics such
as range distribution, metapopulation dynamics and
local adaptation. However, our comprehension of what
drives the evolution of habitat choice and its ensuing74 EvolDir February 1, 2022
consequences remains weak, especially because of the
lack of experimental approaches dedicated to testing
theoretical predictions.
The postdoc project specically aims at testing exper-
imentally theoretical predictions about the conditions
required for habitat choice evolution, and its interactions
with local strategies like phenotypic plasticity. The hired
postdoc will join a dynamic team whose research inter-
ests range from understanding the genetic mechanisms
underlying individual phenotypes, including dispersal,
to the consequences of variability in phenotypic strate-
gies for populations, communities and ecosystems, using
both theory and experiments.
The position will be supervised by Staan Jacob, and
will closely interact with Bart Haegeman (Theoretical
and Experimental Ecology Station, CNRS, France) plus
other membres of the team involved in the project. We
are looking for a highly motivated and dynamic can-
didate with deep conceptual interests in evolutionary
ecology. Previous experience in microbiology is not
mandatory.
Applicants should send a cover letter and a CV to Staan
Jacob (staan.jacob -at- sete.cnrs.fr).

TexasTechU EvoDevoAntSterility
Texas Tech University: Postdoc in developmental genet-
ics and evolution of obligate sterility
The Linksvayer Lab in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Texas Tech University in collaboration with
Arjuna Rajakumar (McGill University) is seeking a post-
doctoral researcher for a new four-year funded NSFproject: Evolutionary developmental systems genetics
of obligate sterility in ants. This project is funded
through the US NSF Enabling Discovery through GE-
nomic Tools (EDGE) - COMPLEX MULTIGENIC
TRAITS TRACK and seeks to understand the de-
velopmental genetics and comparative genomics of an
exciting and tractable complex phenotype: obligate
sterility in ants (see https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID=2128304).
The evolution of eusociality is a major evolutionary
transition, where once solitary organisms become devel-
opmentally integrated and live in colonies. Eusociality is
characterized by a reproductive division of labor between
queen and worker castes. In most species, the worker
caste has reproductive organs and can reproduce under
certain circumstances, while in some species, workers
are obligately sterile. Such obligate sterility, where the
worker caste loses its ovaries early in development, has
evolved 14 times independently in ants. Our project
seeks to understand how obligate sterility evolved us-
ing an integrative evo-devo approach that combines
developmental genetics, comparative transcriptomics,
comparative genomics, and functional genomics.
We are especially looking for candidates with pre-
vious experience in developmental biology and with
molecular techniques (e.g., cloning, in situ/immuno,
RNAi/CRISPR). Knowledge of insect development and
advanced knowledge of microscopy are assets.
The start date is very exible but could be as early as
February 1, 2022.
Salary will be commensurate with experience, with
the NIH NRSA postdoc stipends as a starting guide-

We seek a creative Postdoctoral Research Associate with
experience in mechanistic modeling of ecological systems
and evolutionary dynamics to work in the laboratories
of Dr. Regis Ferriere and Dr. Scott Saleska. The posi-
tion is part of a new Biology Integration Institute (BII),
the EMERGE Institute, funded by the National Science
Foundation. This year-to-year position will be based at
the University of Arizona and will work closely with re-
searchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
and other collaborators of the EMERGE Institute.
The candidate will develop new, cutting-edge models to
analyze eco-evolutionary feedbacks and dynamics in mi-
crobial communities exposed to changing environments,
e.g. climate warming. Specic models will be tailored
to arctic wetland ecosystems and analyzed to evaluate
soil carbon-climate feedbacks.
This project is part of an innovative broadly interdis-
ciplinary eort to advance our understanding of the
microbial and genetic mechanisms by which ecosystems
respond to climate change. Of particular interest is
detecting and quantifying adaptive evolution and dis-
entangling evolutionary responses from ecological ones,
such as changes in community composition or species
abundance.
The broader eort is the new Biology Integration Insti-
tute (BII) EMERGE, designed as a multi-disciplinary
collaboration to integrate studies of microbial and plant
communities and ecosystem function that have been
monitored for more than a decade at Stordalen Mire, in
Arctic Sweden. The wealth of -omics and biogeochemi-
cal observations and experimental data from incubations

*Post-doc position in Plant Sciences *
*/Genetic and functional basis of plant tolerance to
multiple stresses./*
*Two (+1) years position supported by Bordeaux Plant
Science (BPS) research program is available in the
/Fruit Biology and Pathology research unit /in Bor-
deaux, France*.
This post-doc position is one of 19 oered positions as
part of Bordeaux University excellence BPS program,
which will provide access to many scientic events and
resources. The successful candidate will work in close
collaboration with two others post-docs in the Work
Package PROMISE which goal is to study plant re-
sponses to multistress and trade-os between tolerance
and productivity.
*Job description*
Plant health is of primary importance to improve and se-
cure food supply of a growing human population. Virus
infection is one of the most alarming biotic threats due
to the impact of climate change on the spatial and tem-
poral distribution of vectors and viruses. Furthermore,February 1, 2022 EvolDir 83
it has been shown that heat stress largely suppresses the
defence responses produced by the plant during a virus
infection. Plant tolerance can be dened as a trade-
o between stress response and growth maintenance.
In order to be able to propose new tolerant varieties,
this project proposes to nd the genetic and functional
bases of tolerance to combined viral and thermal stress.
To answer this question, the project uses two comple-
mentary plant species: /Arabidopsis thaliana/, as a
model, and /S. pimpenillifolium/, as an ancestor and
source of diversity for tomato. The project will provide
a detailed description of the trade-o between response
to combined stresses and growth using phenotypes of
disease traits, growth, tness and metabolic variables
in /Arabidopsis/ and /S. pimpenillifolium, /and will
help to understand the genetic architecture of tolerance
through GWAs strategies. In the last year of the project,
the post-doctoral candidate will also participate in a
meta-analysis of tolerance in a variety of plants sub-
jected to dierent stresses (thermal, hydric, biotic) in
the framework of the PROMISE WP.
*Environment*
The 'Virology' (V. Schurdi-Levraud), 'FDFE' (F. Del-
mas) and 'Meta' (P. Petriacq) teams of the /Fruit Biol-
ogy and Pathology/research unit are jointly responsible
for this project and are recognised for their expertise
in plant genetics, physiology and metabolism. We are
located on the plant science campus of the Bordeaux
INRAE (French National Research Institute for Agri-
culture, Food and Environment), France.
*Bordeaux*is an easy-going and enjoyable UNESCO
world heritage french city with many cultural, social,
sportive events, famous for its vineyards and only one
hour away from marvellous sand beaches.
*Applicants*
We are looking for highly motivated applicants with a
good publication track-record and a strong commitment
to research. Skills in quantitative genetics, biostatistics
and English communication are expected. Skills/interest
in plant pathology and metabolism would be a plus. Ap-
plicants should include a cover letter describing their
intellectual interests, background, and career goals, as
well as a CV and contact information for three recom-
menders.

We are accepting application for two postdoctoral re-
searcher positions to work with Alexander Kirschel in
the Behavioural Ecology and Evolution Lab at the Uni-
versity of Cyprus. One position is for a bioinformatician
focusing on RNAseq, IsoSeq and genome-wide associa-
tion studies of avian traits associated with behaviour.
The second is for a researcher with expertise in popu-
lation genomics, demographic inference and statistical
analyses. The successful applicants will work on two
new projects involving collaborations with Dr. Brid-
gett vonHoldt at Princeton University and Dr. Andrea
Fulgione at Max Planck Institute of Plant Breeding
Research.
The positions are for an initial 12 months, extendable
up to 24 months, with a gross annual salary range of
euro 26,563.92 - euro 36,208.92 per annum.
The positions will each work on two projects funded by
the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF):
1. Leveraging ancestry to investigate the genomics of
song and colour in birds
This project focuses on a hybrid zone in South Africa
and Eswatini between yellow-fronted and red-fronted
tinkerbirds in which it aims to identify genes and reg-
ulatory regions associated with key phenotypic traits,
including feather colour and song. It involves admixture
mapping, genome-wide association studies and RNAseq
and IsoSeq based studies to investigate gene expression
and expertise in some of those methods as well as in
genomic library preparation would be desired.
Some experience with analysis of avian genomes would
be helpful but not essential. The position is based at
the University of Cyprus, in Nicosia, but is planned to
involve a month-long visit to Princeton to work closely
with Dr. vonHoldt.
2. Continent-wide genomics of hybridisation and specia-
tion

UCyprus SandBeetleMetabarcoding
A postdoctoral research position in DNA metabarcoding
of sand-dwelling beetle assemblages is available at the
University of Cyprus.
POSITION: Two-year postdoctoral position at the
Molecular Ecology & Evolution Lab of the University
of Cyprus, starting 1st of March 2022. The project is
coordinated by Dr. Anna Papadopoulou (University
of Cyprus) and will be developed in collaboration with
Prof. Alfried P. Vogler (The Natural History Museum,
London).
PROJECT DESCRIPTION Coastal sand dune ecosys-
tems are highly dynamic environments, due to their un-
stable substrate and their constant change in response
to wind, waves, tides and sea-level uctuations. Habitat
instability has been proposed to aect dispersal propen-
sity and/or extinction-recolonisation rates, and thus to
play an important role in population dynamics, but em-
pirical evidence remains limited. Previous research of
our group has identied low genetic diversity and shal-
low phylogeographic structure in sand-obligate beetle
lineages, in contrast to their close relatives inhabiting
inland stable habitats (see Papadopoulou et al., 2009;
Molecular ecology 18: 2503-2517). This project will
aim to assess the demographic eects of habitat insta-bility at the assemblage level. For this purpose, we
will sample systematically ten sand dune ecosystems of
dierent sizes and grades of disturbance along the coast
of Cyprus and we will apply whole-organism community
mtDNA metabarcoding with rigorous read ltering pro-
tocols (see Noguerales et al., 2021; Molecular ecology
doi:10.1111/mec.16275) to obtain haplotype-level data
(i.e., Amplicon Sequence Variants; ASVs) for each of the
sampled beetle taxa. Based on the ASV data, we will
estimate intrapopulation genetic diversity and metrics
of population dierentiation for each species and we will
apply comparative phylogeographic analyses to test for
concerted demographic responses (see Papadopoulou
& Knowles, 2015; PNAS 113:8018-8024) across sand-
dwelling taxa of dierent traits (e.g., sand-obligate vs.
habitat generalists, ightless vs. winged taxa).
RESPONSIBILITIES: 1. Participation in eld sam-
pling of sand-dune ecosystems and sample processing.
2. Sanger sequencing for selected voucher specimens.
3. DNA metabarcoding library preparation from bulk
Coleoptera samples. 4. Bioinformatic analyses of
metabarcoding data at the species (OTUs) and hap-
lotype levels (ASVs) 4. Comparative phylogeographic
and population genetic analyses based on the generated
ASVs dataset. 5. Publication of results.
REQUIREMENTS: Applicants are required to have:
1. PhD in Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Ecology
or related elds. 2. Experience in DNA metabarcod-
ing methods, including relevant wet-lab protocols and
bioinformatic analyses. 3. Experience in Linux/Unix
and common statistical environments (e.g., R, Python).
4. Excellent oral and written communication skills in
English.
Additional desirable skills: 1. Previous work on insects
(preferably Coleoptera). 2. Experience in eld sam-
pling. 3. Experience in phylogeography and population
genetics.
APPLICATION: Applicants should provide the follow-
ing documents (preferably as a single pdf le): 1. letter
of interest (up to 1 page) 2. short CV (up to 2 pages) 3.

UEdinburgh EvolutionaryGenetics
A 3-year postdoctoral research position based at the
University of Edinburgh is available in the labs of Jar-
rod Hadeld, Darren Obbard and Ben Longdon on the
NERC-funded project 'The Additive Genetic Variance
of Fitness in Semi-Natural and Laboratory Environ-
ments'. We are looking for an enthusiastic and moti-
vated postdoc interested in evolutionary population and
quantitative genetics.
The project will focus on a large experiment con-
ducted on eld and laboratory populations of Drosophila
melanogaster. The aim is to estimate the additive ge-
netic variance in tness under semi-natural conditions,
providing the rst eld-based estimate of this impor-
tant parameter in an invertebrate. By conducting a
replicate experiment under laboratory conditions, we
will also be able to estimate the genetic correlation be-
tween tness in the lab and the eld, allowing us to
test the evolutionary and ecological relevance of lab-
based tness estimates. Unlike standard approaches
that require measuring survival and fecundity of pedi-
greed individuals, estimates will be obtained directly
from next-generation sequencing using a combination
of newly developed theory and new statistical method-
ology. The approach will also allow us to decompose
genetic variation in tness into genome regions (e.g. sex
chromosomes versus autosomes) or genomic functions
(e.g. coding versus regulatory) illuminating the genetic
architecture of tness, evolution's most important trait.
Applicants should have a strong background in evolu-
tionary or statistical genetics (population and/or quan-
titative) and a PhD in a relevant subject area (genetics,
evolutionary biology, statistics, or similar). Experience
working with genomic data and good bio-informatics and
statistical skills would be benecial, as would a strong
track record of independent and creative thinking.

Postdoctoral position in Viral Landscape Phylogeogra-
phy University of Brussels (ULB), Belgium Start date:
as soon as possible (and no latter than the 1st of July,
2022) Application date: 30 January 2022
A 2-year post-doc position is open at the Spa-
tial Epidemiology Lab (SpELL) of the University
of Brussels (ULB) to work on landscape phylo-
geographic approaches (https://spell.ulb.be/subject/-
landscape-phylogeography). The position is available
immediately and should start no later than July 1, 2022.
The researcher will work on a research project funded
by an Incentive Grant for Scientic Research awarded
by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientique (FNRS, Bel-
gium).
The ght against high-impact viral diseases would ben-
et from a better understanding of the drivers of virus
spreads, which could in turn help designing intervention
strategies. There is a need for analytical approaches
allowing to formally test the impact of environmental
(e.g. ecologic, climatic or anthropogenic) factors on the
dispersal of viruses. Recent advances in genomics, math-92 EvolDir February 1, 2022
ematical modelling and computational biology have led
to evolutionary approaches becoming key methods to in-
vestigate the spread of infectious diseases. In particular,
the development of a spatially-explicit phylogeographic
method has enabled to reconstruct dispersal history of
epidemics on a continuous space, using only a relatively
limited number of viral sequences sampled from known
locations and times. At the Spatial Epidemiology Lab
(University of Brussels, ULB), one of our main research
projects consists in exploiting such spatially-explicit phy-
logeographic to unravel the impact of external factors
on the dispersal history and dynamics of viral spreads.
Specically, we aim to develop, test, compare, apply,
and share novel approaches to analyse the impact of envi-
ronmental factors on the dispersal history and dynamic
of viral lineages.
The researcher will work on the development, test, and
application of new methodological approaches to com-
bine phylogeographic inference and analyses of the im-
pact of environmental factors. Once tested with simula-
tion procedures, the best methodologies will be applied
on several case studies associated with notable wildlife
and socio-economic impacts (e.g. West Nile virus, Lassa
virus, avian inuenza viruses, and rabies virus).
The researcher will be aliated and work within the
Spatial Epidemiology Lab (SpELL, http://spell.ulb.be),
which has a recognised expertise in spatial and molecular
epidemiology. Globally, the Spatial Epidemiology Lab
aims to study the eect of spatial factors on the emer-
gence, spread, persistence and evolution of diseases, as
well as invasive species. The understanding of key spatial
factors, such as environmental or anthropogenic vari-
ables, and their integration into spatial models is used to
predict the geographical distribution of risk, which can
contribute to better targeted prevention, surveillance
and control measures.
The candidate should hold a Ph.D. in evolution-
ary biology, molecular epidemiology or phylogeogra-
phy/population genetics, should have a strong interest
in epidemiology and ecology, and should have demon-
strated computational, communication and writing skills
(English). Knowledge and use of the programming lan-
guage R is required.
Applications should include a cover letter, a curriculum
vitae, PDFs of the three most representative publica-
tions, and a list of three references with e-mail contact
information. Applications should be submitted as soon
as possible.

** DEADLINE EXTENDED **
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate for
a three-year post doc position as part of this excit-
ing collaborative research project between the Univer-
sity of Oslo, University of Nottingham (UK) and the
Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW). The
researcher will help develop our understanding of the
evolutionary origins of human-commensalism in Passer
sparrows. The project will focus on two key questions;
1) does human commensalism have a single origin within
the house sparrow? and 2) has adaptation to a human-
commensal niche occurred in parallel in the tree spar-
row?
We aim to combine morphological and genomic data
from existing datasets, museum samples and ongoing
eldwork to address the core aims of the project. The
successful candidate will be allowed to choose aspects of
the larger program as best ts their skills and research
interests. They will also be encouraged to develop
additional, complementary avenues of research. The
researcher will oversee population-level whole genome
resequencing from the wet-lab to data interrogation
and will be expected to be procient in bioinformatics
(R/Unix/Python) with documented skills in genomic
analyses. A PhD in population genetics/genomics, evo-February 1, 2022 EvolDir 95
lutionary genomics, evolutionary biology or a related
subject is necessary. Experience with working with birds
and bird genomes would be helpful but is not a require-
ment. The researcher will be based at the Centre for
Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis at the University
of Oslo but will also be expected to visit the University
of Nottingham (UK) for additional training and support
with research visits to the Netherlands. There will likely
be opportunities for eldwork in Central and Southern
Asia. The working language of the research group is
English.
It is becoming exceedingly clear that humans have been,
and still are, drastically altering the planet. Although
human activity typically has a negative eect on bio-
diversity, some species have rapidly adapted to novel
niches opened up by human activity. The house sparrow
(Passer domesticus) is a successful human commensal
that thrives in human created niches. It has adapted to
urban and agricultural habitats on every continent ex-
cept Antarctica. Intriguingly, a number of other Passer
sparrows are also human commensals having likely ex-
perienced similar selective pressures; one of the most
striking is the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus),
which is an obligate commensal across much of East Asia.
The overarching aim of this newly funded project (Nor-
wegian Research Council) is to determine the evolution-
ary causes and consequences of human commensalism
in Passer sparrows using whole genome resequencing,
high resolution phenotyping and extensive eldwork.

Title: Post-doctoral position to investigate evolution of
novel species interaction using an experimental evolution
approach
Location: Uppsala University, Sweden
Duration: Time-limited postdoc scholarship
(stipend,100%) for a period of 2 years (starting
date will be as soon as possible).
We are seeking to hire a post-doc to investigate the
ecological conditions that result in evolution of novel
species interactions. To determine these conditions the
project will employ an experimental evolution approach
and will make use of multi-species systems of bacteria.
The research is led by Dr. Omar Warsi and will be
carried out at the Department of Medical Biochemistry
and Microbiology at Uppsala University, Sweden.
Project description: Ecological interactions are ubiq-
uitous in nature and have been a focus of study for
ecologists and evolutionary biologists for over a century.
These studies have increased our understanding about
the mechanistic basis of these interactions. However, ex-cept for interactions involving competition for a common
resource, very little work has been done to investigate
conditions that either cause or result dierent species
to interact in either antagonistic or synergistic manner.
Two key questions in this regard are i) How impor-
tant are the environmental conditions and the genetic
make-up of the interacting species in determining the
emergence of novel ecological interaction, and ii) can we
predict the factors resulting in emergence of dierent
types of interactions, or that lead to a switch between
dierent interactions? The aim of this project is to ll
in this gap by making empirical predictions about the
emergence of novel interactions between co-occurring
bacterial species in dierent ecological conditions, and
by testing the ecological factors that aect these predic-
tions using an experimental evolution approach.
Qualications: We are looking for a postdoc that has
a PhD in evolutionary biology or evolutionary ecology,
where the PhD work was focused on bacterial systems.
Experience of work with experimental evolution and
knowledge of ecological theories of species interactions
are desirable. The successful candidate should demon-
strate excellent analytical and practical skills, an ability
to independently plan experiments, and be enthusiastic
to supervise Master's students. They should have high
skills in written and spoken English and the ability to
work in a multi-disciplinary team.
Instructions for application: To apply, please
send your application to Dr. Omar Warsi at
omar.warsi@imbim.uu.se.
and include in your application as a single pdf:i)A
cover letter briey describing your research interests
and a motivation for why you would be suitable for
this position (maximum 2 pages)ii)Curriculum vitae

UppsalaU PlantGeneticsGenomics
Position for one Postdoc in Ecological Plant Genet-
ics/Genomics at the Evolutionary Biology Centre, Upp-
sala University, Sweden
We seek a Postdoc to join a project examining the
genetic and ecological mechanisms behind adaptive pop-
ulation dierentiation in plants, and the capacity for
adaptive evolution in natural populations of the plant
model organism Arabidopsis thaliana in response to
environmental change. The research will be conducted
within the framework of an international research col-
laboration. The goals are to identify QTL (quantitative
trait loci) contributing to local adaptation and to key
traits involved in adaptation, to characterize the eects,
genetic basis and geographic distribution of QTL alle-
les, and to examine whether adaptive evolution in local
populations is constrained by trade-os and pleiotropy,
and/or the xation of deleterious mutations. One focus
will be on the genetic basis and adaptive signicance
of variation in owering time. Duties include the estab-
lishment and monitoring of experiments in the eld and
under controlled conditions in the lab, QTL-mapping,
data analysis, and the preparation of manuscripts for
publication. Specic subprojects can be tailored to the
skills and interests of the successful candidate.
We are looking for a candidate with a keen interest in
population genetics, genomics, QTL-mapping, evolu-
tionary ecology and/or ecophysiology. Prociency in
English is a requirement.
The successful postdoc candidate should have a PhD
completed within 3 years of the application deadline
(reasons such as prolonged periods of illness and parental
leave can motivate a longer period). The postdoc posi-
tion lasts for two years.

synthesis to study the genetic and molecular basis of
cellular life and its diversity. We have developed ap-
proaches for capturing segments of natural chromosomes
and reassembling them into synthetic chromosomes in a
programmable manner in yeast. These synthetic chro-
mosomes can be substituted for natural chromosomes
and used to address fundamental questions in genetics,
evolution, and systems biology, some of which are dis-
cussed inhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-
19753-2 . We are presently focused on the minimal
genetic requirementsfor eukaryotic chromosomes and
genomes; the phenotypic consequences of changes in
gene order and chromosome architecture; the genetic
basis of isolation and phenotypic dierences between
species, if not genera; and the origin and evolution of the
mitochondrial compartment. We are also constructing
a yeast strain with all transcription factors relocated to
a common neochromosome, which will enable minimiza-
tion and global rewiring of trans gene regulation, as well
as a myriad of other basic and applied projects. The-
seprojects are funded by NIH, NSF, Agilent, and USC,
with a number of additional proposals pending. New
project ideas are welcome and the successful candidate
will be supported in developing their own trajectories.
Candidates from diverse backgrounds are encouraged
to apply. Ideal applicants will likely have expertise in
molecular biology, genomics, and computational anal-
ysis,as well as compelling intellectual questions about
evolution and inheritance that can be answered using
chromosome synthesis. Strengths in working with others100 EvolDir February 1, 2022
and mentoring graduate students and undergraduates
are highly desirable. Salary and benets will be competi-

is available for at least two years,if not longer. The
successful candidate will be expected to apply for post-
doctoral fellowships after starting, but the position is
not contingent on obtaining a fellowship.
Please direct applications and/or questions to Ian Ehren-
reich (ian.ehrenreich@usc.edu). Applicants should in-
clude a cover letter describing their intellectual interests,

UUmea 2 EvolutionaryModeling
Two Postdocs in Mathematical Modeling of Microbial
Evolution
We are happy to announce two Kempe-funded post-
doctoral fellowships available for a start date sometime
in 2022. Each position is available for two years and
will be based at Ume ~A¥University's interdisciplinary
center IceLab in the research group of Eric Libby and
also aliated with the Department of Mathematics and
Mathematical Statistics at Ume ~A¥University. Can-
didates should have a quantitative background with
an interest in analyzing mathematical models of bio-
logical systems. Below we provide descriptions of the
two postdocs and the required qualications, which are
quite similar. Importantly we note that these calls are
completely open and interested candidates can apply to
both.
Postdoc position 1: \Predicting the coevolutionary tra-
jectories of simple microbial communities"
Overview:
The evolutionary fate of microbial communities can be
dicult to predict. Even simple systems consisting of
only a few species or strains can abruptly shift course,
e.g. cooperating bacteria can gain mutations that cause
them to compete. While experiments have started to
probe the evolutionary trajectories of simple microbial
communities, the ndings are often idiosyncratic|either
due to dierences in the specic setup or the fact that
evolution relies on chance events. We lack general un-
derstanding and, importantly, null models that shape
our expectations and allow for predictions. This project
addresses these signicant gaps in our understanding by
harnessing a unique database of metabolic models that
the PIs have established to identify broad statistical
patterns concerning the nature of putative ecological
interactions. The postdoc will simulate eco-evolutionary
dynamics with an aim to uncover simple predictive rules.
We anticipate the postdoc's work to open up many ad-
ditional avenues of exploration that will result in future
collaborative ventures both within the team and with
IceLab and the broader academic community. This
postdoc will be supervised by a team of researchersat Ume ~A¥University: Eric Libby, Peter Lind, Ludvig
Lizana, and Bj orn Schr oder.
Application deadline: January 31st
Postdoc position 2: \A theoretical framework for the
evolution of benecial endosymbioses"
A pivotal event in the evolution of life on earth was
the endosymbiosis that gave rise to mitochondria and
eukaryotes. It is unparalleled in terms of its signicance
as it is thought to have fueled the evolution of all large,
complex life. Yet, unlike other major transition in evolu-
tion, we lack model systems or theoretical frameworks to
understand its origin and evolution. The central aim of
this project is to address this signicant knowledge gap
by developing theoretical models to study a key step in
the evolution of life: the endosymbiosis that led to the
mitochondria and the eukaryotic lineage. To this end,
we welcome applicants keen to model the evolutionary
dynamics of nascent endosymbioses. This is a broad
area with multiple directions and possible types of mod-
eling, e.g. dierential equations, computer simulations,
metabolic models, etc. The appointed candidate will
have the opportunity to carry out collaborative research
according to a mutually agreed research plan. This
postdoc will be supervised by Eric Libby.
Application deadline: February 15th
Qualications:
To qualify for the fellowships, the candidate should have
a PhD degree, or a foreign degree that is deemed equiva-
lent, in one of the following elds: Evolutionary biology,
Computational Biology, Mathematical Biology, Micro-
biology, Molecular Biology, or other related disciplines.
A candidate who has not completed their degree prior
to this may be considered if special circumstances exist.
Special circumstances include absence due to illness,
parental leave or clinical practice, appointments of trust
in trade unions or similar circumstances. The ideal can-
didate should have strong skills in implementing and
analyzing mathematical models.
The applicant needs additionally to have excellent skills
in modern computer programming languages such as
C++, Python, MATLAB or R so as to simulate evo-
lutionary dynamics Personal qualities such as collab-
oration, communication, strong drive and motivation,
critical thinking abilities, creativity and analytical skills
are essential. The applicant should be able to perform
research independently and as part of a team. Good
knowledge of oral and written English is required.

Biodiversity and Integrative Taxonomy of Invertebrates
Location: Friday Harbor Laboratories Instructors: Drs.
Gustav Paulay & Kevin Kocot Dates: July 18 to Au-
gust 19, 2022 (Summer B) Credits: 9 Designation:
FHL/BIOL 536
This course will cover methods for documenting and
describing species-level diversity of invertebrate animals
and applications of these methods in evolution, ecology,
resource management, etc. Emphasis will be placed
on small and often overlooked taxa (e.g., meiofauna),
but the content of the course will be broadly applica-
ble to the study of diverse invertebrates. Typical ma-
rine ecosystems hold thousands of multicellular species;
metazoan diversity around FHL is likely between 3-5,000species. A large proportion of marine species are com-
plexes of previously undierentiated taxa. Many species
are identied incorrectly in regional checklists because
of a history of tting local species into named taxa from
other regions, ubiquity of cryptic species complexes, and
limitations of past approaches. Thus, the taxonomy of
most major marine taxa needs to be reevaluated and
often redone.
The objectives of this course are to train students
broadly in morphological and molecular approaches in
invertebrate biodiversity and taxonomy. This course
will help train the next generation of researchers who
will use integrative taxonomic approaches to document
and improve understanding of invertebrate biodiversity.
Students will learn the crucial considerations of study
design in the eld, lab, and bioinformatic stages of this
eld.
We will be joined by ~10 guest mentors who are world
experts in invertebrate taxonomy. These individuals will
give guest lectures and work one-on-one with students
in the lab.
This course is supported by National Science Founda-
tion grants to the instructors and signicant nancial
aid is available!

Course overview:
This course will provide attendees with the basics to
understand and implement age-depth models for par-
tially dated stratigraphic data. The focus will be on
radiocarbon dating but the approach extends to many
other forms of dated information, and will be relevant to
those who have a wide variety of palaeo-environmental
reconstruction problems. As is common in age-depth
modelling, the Bayesian paradigm will be used to cre-
ate the age-depth models, though no prior experience
with Bayesian software or methods is required. The
course will cover the use of multiple dierent R pack-
ages though the focus will be on the author's own Bchron
software.Attendees are encouraged to bring their own
data sets and explore them using the tools covered dur-
ing the course.106 EvolDir February 1, 2022

In this course, we will teach the use of popular GSEA
tools, both for online-based tools and those implemented
as R packages. We will give a detailed introduction on a
varietay of methods of GSEA analysis, including overrep-
resentation analysis, univariate methods, multivariate
methods, as well as extensions of GSEA analysis, such as
network-based GSEA, and single-sample GSEA. Finally,
you will also learn downstream processing of GSEA re-
sults, including eciently visualizing the massive GSEA
results, clustering, and simplifying GSEA results via
various methods. In the course, we will cover some other
topics that are tightly related to GSEA analysis, such
as multiple hypothesis testing. You will also learn how
to implement GSEA methods completely from scratch
in R.
The course is aimed at students and researchers with
limited statistical knowledge and they should have a
basic knowledge of R programming, e.g. basic data
structures (vectors, data frames, lists).

Online MorphologicalPhylogenetics
Feb14-25
Dear colleagues,
Registration is open for Transmitting Science on-
line course: MORPHOLOGICAL PHYLOGENETICS:
PRINCIPLES, APPLICATIONS, AND TECHNIQUES
- 5th edition.Dates: February 14th-25th, 2022
This course will be delivered ONLINE: 35 hours of on-
line live lessons. A good internet connection is required
to follow the course.
Max number of students: 18, slots will be allocated in
rst come, rst served basis.
Course Overview:
An accurate reconstruction of evolutionary relationships
among species is the cornerstone of evolutionary bi-
ology. Building phylogenetic trees thus provides the
fundamental framework upon which systematic, biogeo-
graphic and evolutionary research operates. Morpholog-
ical phylogenetics provides a unique toolkit for inferring
relationships, considering that the vast majority of the
species that have ever lived are now extinct and can
only be assessed based on morphological data. Addi-
tionally, combining fossils and morphological data with
molecular data from extant species is becoming the most
comprehensive method of assessing phylogenetic rela-
tionships on deep time and the time of origin of major
evolutionary lineages.
In this course, we will focus on the analysis of morpho-
logical data (and combining morphological data with
molecular data) using multiple optimality criteria for
phylogenetic inference. We will discuss the best avail-
able approaches to construct morphological data sets
and their impact on phylogenies. We will follow with
theory and hands-on practice of phylogenetic programs
using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and
Bayesian inference. Participants will learn how to com-
bine morphological and molecular data for total evidence
analyses, how to conduct time-calibrations using tip and
node dating, dierent birth-death models, morphological
clocks and combined evidence relaxed clock analyses.
Softwares: Mesquite, TNT, RAxML, IQTree, Mr. Bayes
and BEAST.

Tempe Arizona UrbanEvolution
May20-21
Dear colleagues, we want to bring your attention to
a call for participants (from all career stages) for an
NSF-supported, DCL-LTER urban evolution workshop
entitled, Multifaceted mechanisms of metropolis: Inte-
grating society, ecology, evolution, and plasticity (SEEP)
to advance urban evolutionary ecology.
We invite you to attend a 2-day, hybrid (in-person and
virtual) workshop, May 20 &21, 2022 in Tempe Arizona,
the site of the NSF CAP-LTER. Our focus is on the
intersection of evolutionary biology, physiological, and
behavioral ecology to ask to what extent do organisms
respond to the altered climate and resource availability
of urban areas via phenotypic plasticity, genetic adapta-
tion, and/or the evolution of adaptive plasticity? This
workshop will hone our mechanistic understanding of thegenetic, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms that
scale up to population- and community-level changes in
the abundance and distribution of animals in metropoli-
tan regions, as well as the human drivers, outcomes,
and feedbacks that shape these changes across hetero-
geneous urban landscapes and over time (see Figure
attached). Our focus on mechanistic drivers will center
on ve human-altered resources and selective agents
associated with urbanization: heat, food, water, pollu-
tion, and species interactions. Importantly, synergistic
and inclusive frameworks that integrate well-being and
equity for both human and non-human populations will
be necessary for advancing positive ecosystem outcomes
and social-ecological solutions.
If you like to think about urban evolution, socio-
environmental justice, long-term data, ...{ consider join-
ing us for this workshop. If interested please visit our
website at:
Seepworkshop.com
And ll out a statement of interest at:
https://forms.gle/yYEJUVcjyVa19yDe9 to tell us more
about yourself, your research interests, career stage, tax-
onomic focus, and whether you are applying for travel

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct categoryFebruary 1, 2022 EvolDir 113
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
