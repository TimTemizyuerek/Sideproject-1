FINAL CALL FOR SYMPOSIA PROPOSALS
***Respond by 28 FEBRUARY for full considera-
tion***
Please email Victor A. Albert (vic-
tor.albert@nhm.uio.no) with concrete plans for
symposia, including a 1-2 paragraph description, and
a list of proposed speakers and their topics. These
symposia proposals will be assessed in light of other
proposals registered.
SYMPOSIA PROPOSALS SHOULD FOCUS ONTOPICS OF PHYLOGENETIC OR PHYLOGE-
NOMIC INTEREST, THEORETICAL AND/OR EM-
PIRICAL.
Symposia may be tightly or loosely circum-
scribed, but must center on an overarching theme.
Student/postdoc/principal-investigator presentations
may be mixed. All abstracts (each ISI listed) will be
published in the journal CLADISTICS, and symposium
proceedings proposals will be entertained.
This conference on PHYLOGENETIC BIOLOGY
(both theoretical and empirical) will be held at the

html/en-gb72665.jsp ) in the beautiful mountains just
north of Oslo, Norway.
Single or double rooms with a full pension package will
be available, as will cheaper options for youth hostel
bookings with or without full pension at the nearby
Quality Fagernes Hotell. Package rates have been ne-
gotiated to rather reasonable costs, and all sessions will
be held on-site at the hotel.
Presentations are invited within pre-planned symposia
(above), or as selected from contributions (e.g., from
poster submissions) as time permits. All poster presen-
tations are welcome. The Willi Hennig Society strongly
encourages participation from students and postdocs on
their developing research, either theoretical or empiri-
cal. There are several cash student prizes that will be
awarded.
Please check back on the Evoldir web site for full reg-
istration information, or for preliminary details, email

BACKGROUND Bioinformatics and statistical genet-
ics, twin themes of the long-running series of an-
nual MASAMB meetings (see the archive at http:/-
/www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/masamb ), have gained
huge impetus from large-scale genome sequencing
projects and development of high-throughput biological
assay systems, including gene-expression microarrays.
These immense data resources, and the underlying com-
plexities of molecular and cell biology, provide exciting
research opportunitities for numerate scientists.
With typically around 60-80 participants from math-
ematics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics,
biology and related ﬁelds, the MASAMB meetings
provide an intimate setting for exchange of ideas in
methodological and applied research. Research stu-
dents and scientists newly entering the ﬁeld of genomic
and/or post-genomic research are particularly welcome.

RoyalSocietyLondon SexualConﬂict
May9-10
A Royal Society discussion meeting on ’Sexual conﬂict:
a new paradigm?’ is taking place in London on Monday
9 and Tuesday 10 May 2005. This meeting is organised
by Dr Tracey Chapman, Dr Tom Tregenza and Dr Nina
Wedell. A synopsis follows:
Sexual reproduction is fraught with conﬂict. The po-
tential for mates to exploit one another leads to diver-
gence in sex roles and two very diﬀerent types of indi-
vidual being built by the same genes. Knowledge of the
conﬂicts between genes in males and females is shaping
how we understand the evolution of mating systems, of
sex ratios and of sex itself.

uate students. This conference provides an informal
venue for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral
students interested in ecology to present their research
to an audience of their peers, fostering an environment
of collaboration and communication between future sci-
entists.
This year, MEEC will be hosted by Southern Illinois
University in Carbondale, Illinois, and held at the Car-
bondale Civic Center from March 11-13, 2005. The con-
ference will feature a keynote address by Dr. Robert E.
Ricklefs, Curators’ Professor of Biology at the Depart-
ment of Biology, University of Missouri at St. Louis,
and a plenary presentation by Dr. Jerry O. Wolﬀ, Pro-
gram Director for the National Science Foundation.
In addition to contributed sessions on topics in ecology
and evolution, invited and contributed papers will be
considered for two special
symposia:(1) Paleoecology, and (2) Conservation and
Climate Change. Manuscripts submitted from presen-
tations will be considered for publication in a special
issue of the American Midland Naturalist.
Deadline for submission of abstracts and early regis-
tration is February 1st, 2005. Early registration fee is

UOregon Zebraﬁsh Sept9-10
Dear Zebraﬁsh Community,
This is an announcement for the Third Biennial West
Coast Zebraﬁsh Meeting, to be held September 9-10,
2005 at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Follow-
ing the tradition of successful meetings held in Seat-
tle in 2001 and Salt Lake City in 2003, we look for-
ward to hosting another great conference. Please mark
your calendar! These dates do not overlap with theSDB meeting, the European Zebraﬁsh Meeting, or the
Woods Hole Zebraﬁsh Course and early September is a
beautiful time of year to visit Oregon.
The ﬁsh labs here in Eugene (Cresko, Darimont, Eisen,
Guillemin, Kimmel, Postlethwait, Varga, Washbourne,
and Westerﬁeld) would be delighted to have you and
your lab come and visit. While we anticipate that most
attendees will be from the West Coast, everyone is wel-
come, and we hope that many U of O alumni will use
this meeting as an opportunity to visit their old stomp-
ing grounds and reunite with friends.
Our intent is to have a fun, informal, and interactive
meeting. We hope to attract researchers in all areas
of zebraﬁsh biology, as well as those working in re-
lated systems such as stickleback and medaka. We are
particularly interested in providing a forum for grad-
uate students and postdocs to present their work and
to promote more discussion than is sometimes possi-
ble in the packed schedule of larger meetings. We also
intend to keep this meeting aﬀordable. There are di-
rect ﬂights from many West Coast cities to Eugene.
Cheaper fares can sometimes be obtained by ﬂying into
Portland, which is an hour and 45 minute drive from
Eugene. Rooms will be available at several motels in
easy walking distance of the conference for ~$80/double
occupancy. We expect that registration fees will be in
the range of ~$150, which will include all meals during
the conference (two breakfasts, two lunches, and two
dinners) as well as coﬀee breaks and refreshments at
the opening reception. We encourage people to stay
over the weekend and will have planned outdoor activ-
ities for Sunday.
We hope that you will join us for the Third Biennial
West Coast Zebraﬁsh Meeting and we ask that you
spread the word to other colleagues who might be in-
terested. By the ﬁrst of May we will post informa-
tion about registration and abstract submission on our
meeting website ( http://www.uoneuro.uoregon.edu/-
wczm/wczm.html ). In the meantime, please feel free
to email with comments, questions, or suggestions to:

UOxford HapMap Mar15-18 TravelFebruary 1, 2005 EvolDir 9
Two important things to note about the forthcoming
conference on the HapMap and its applications.
1) NHGRI is making travel awards for young investiga-
tors, and
2) The deadline for submitting abstracts is January
28,2005
The conference announcement and details regarding
travel awards follow below for ease of reference.
Conference: Genomic Studies and the HapMap Univer-
sity of Oxford, UK March 15-18, 2005
The deadline for submitting an abstract is January 28,
2005. The deadline for registration/lodging reserva-
tions is February 25, 2005.
By March 2005, Phase I of the HapMap (600,000 com-
mon SNPs typed in 270 individuals) will be complete
and Phase II (an additional 3-4M SNPs in the same
samples) will be well underway. But there remain many
unresolved questions about how best to utilize this in-
formation in genetic research. This conference will be
hosted by the Department of Statistics at the Univer-
sity of Oxford, and supported in part by the Wellcome
Trust, and its primary focus will be the use of the
HapMap resource in genomic studies: human disease
studies, and other population genetic and evolutionary
analyses.
“Genomic Studies and the HapMap” will provide an
important opportunity for a diverse community of
investigators-those involved directly in the Interna-
tional HapMap Project, those in the broader analysis
community, and those whose focus is disease studies-
to come together to deﬁne and discuss a range of is-
sues related to the use of the HapMap resource. It will
also provide up-to-date assessments of the progress and
results from the project. Invited speakers from out-
side the HapMap project include Andy Clarke, David
Clayton, David Cox, Mark McCarthy, Rasmus Nielsen,
Jonathan Pritchard, Matthew Stephens, and Simon
Tavar´ e. This conference follows a successful meeting
held in the spring of 2004, which brought together well
over 100 participants interested in methods and analy-
sis related to the International Haplotype Map Project.
The National Human Genome Research Institute is pro-
viding travel awards of $750 to up to 13 young investi-
gators from U.S. institutions (deﬁned as completion of
doctoral training within the last 6 years). U.S. citizen-
ship is not a requirement. Qualiﬁed persons requesting
consideration for a travel award must submit the follow-
ing items to melindaagray@comcast.net, no later than
January 28:
1) current CV2) formatted abstract (please refer to the abstract sub-
mission guidelines on the conference Web site)
3) conference registration and lodging form (please re-
fer to the registration page on the conference Web site,
and note that your credit card will not be billed until
early March)
Awards will be made based on the research submitted in
the abstract and the academic promise of the candidate
with some priority given to applications from women,
underrepresented minorities, and applicants with dis-
abilities. Submitted material will be reviewed, and
funding decisions made, by the conference programme
committee.
Complete instructions for abstract submission and
registration, and further details of the confer-
ence, can be found at the conference Web ite,

Marie Curie Research training network (MRTN) SEX-
ASEX 2 positions available
Students and researchers interested in the paradox of
sex in evolutionary biology are strongly encouraged to
apply for a research position in the European Union
Marie Curie Research Training Network SEXASEX,
which is co-ordinated by Prof. Dr. Koen Martens,
RBINSc, Brussels. Criteria of eligibility include: EU
citizenship, less than 4 years of research experience for
Young Researchers (YR), less than 10 years for Experi-
enced Researchers (ER), and a willingness to work in a
European country other than the country of origin. We12 EvolDir February 1, 2005
seek candidates who are enthusiastic about evolution-
ary biology, travelling and living abroad, learning in a
multidisciplinary research environment and working in
teams. All appointments will be for 3 years, YR are
oﬀered PhD positions, ER post-doc positions. YR will
be expected to obtain a PhD at the end of the project.
The application of female candidates is especially en-
couraged; detailed information on child care facilities
at the diﬀerent institutions will be provided upon re-
quest. Aid can be sought if accompanying spouses also
require employment abroad.
Project overview: Sex is the queen of evolutionary
problems. It will be tackled by SEXASEX in a mul-
tidisciplinary approach, providing training and trans-
fer of knowledge for a total of 360 person-months. 10
network researchers (6 young researchers (YR) and 4
experienced researchers (ER)) will receive training in
9 institutions across as many countries. A wide ar-
ray of research tools will provide excellent training op-
portunities, for example through individual career de-
velopment plans, individual tutoring and secondments,
which will be supplemented by participation in courses
and external workshops. Network-wide training will ex-
ploit the extensive experience of the partner institutions
through ﬁve courses and summer schools for all network
researchers. Complementary skills such as management
and communication (verbal, written) will be developed,
and gender awareness will be raised, in two network-
wide meetings. The networks theoretical and empiri-
cal research will apply 13 major approaches, including
novel genomic and karyological approaches, intraspe-
ciﬁc phylogeography, ecology, behavioural studies, GIS
analyses and theoretical modelling. With this mul-
tidisciplinary toolkit, SEXASEX will investigate why
sex exists at all, given its evolutionary costs, using the
model organism Eucypris virens, a non-marine ostra-
cod species with both sexual and asexual reproduction.
What determines its gender, what are the genomic con-
sequences of long-term asexuality, what is the cohesive-
ness of a species with mixed reproduction, how do asex-
uals and sexuals compete and what is their historical
zoogeography? The pluralistic approach of SEXASEX
is unique and timely, using highly novel methodologies
and dealing with cutting edge science based on Euro-
pean excellence and tradition. Please refer to http://-
www.naturalsciences.be/EVIRENS/ for more informa-
tion.

GRADUATE STUDIES IN EVOLUTIONARY ECOL-
OGY AT CALGARY
I am seeking to recruit graduate students interested in
community and evolutionary ecology into my research
group for September 2005. Calgary is a thriving, young
city located a little over an hour away from the beautiful
Canadian Rockies. Research in the lab focuses on the
evolutionary consequences of interactions between nat-
ural enemies (e.g., predators, parasitoids, herbivores)
and their prey, although I am also interested in the fac-
tors that aﬀect oviposition decisions in phytophagous
insects and understanding correlations between ecology
and breeding system in ﬂowering plants.
I am especially interested in students with experience
with/genuine passion for insects to conduct research
in one of two areas: (1) examining how the presence
of parasitoid wasps aﬀects competition and coexistence
between sympatric strains and species of bruchid seed
beetles, and (2) examining how predaceous dragonﬂy
larvae aﬀect community structure of dytiscid diving
beetles. Project 1 will take place in the lab, and Project
2 will involve ﬁeldwork and extensive sorting and iden-
tiﬁcation of samples in the lab.
Research support will typically be provided by teach-
ing assistantships during fall and winter terms and
a stipend during the summer. Ample opportuni-
ties exist for candidates with strong academic back-
grounds to supplement base income/research support
through external scholarships and research funding
<e.g., http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/biodiversity/-

MSc/PhD in the EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE &
COGNITION One year taught Masters & PhD pro-
gramme
University of Edinburgh, UK
What is it that makes us human? How did our brains
evolve? What are the origins of human language? Why
do we think the way we do? What are the mechanisms
of biological, cultural and linguistic evolution?
The University of Edinburgh is now in the second year
of a successful Postgraduate Programme in the Evolu-
tion of Language and Cognition. Students tackle the
key questions that are at the heart of the recent renais-February 1, 2005 EvolDir 17
sance in the scientiﬁc study of the origins and evolution
of human language and cognition.
The programme consists of two components: an inter-
disciplinary 1 year taught Masters degree, and a su-
pervised PhD. Students will apply for one or the other
degree, depending on background and experience. The
MSc year can be used as preparation for the PhD.
Human evolution is a topic for cognitive scientists, psy-
chologists, linguists, archaeologists, anthropologists, bi-
ologists, and computer scientists. Because of this, the
postgraduate programme will suit students from a wide
range of backgrounds. If you are interested in learning
more about the evolution of human cognition and lan-
guage, and about the many disciplines that contribute
to its study, we’d like to hear from you.
We are now accepting applications for entry to the MSc
in September 2005, and for entry to the PhD at any
time.
To ﬁnd out more about the course, and what it will be
like to live and work in Edinburgh, go to our website.
Here you will also ﬁnd full details about how to apply.

We are inviting applications from students with a MSc
degree to study the systematics and evolution of Myr-
mica ants for four years, starting in spring 2005, as a
fulﬁlment of a PhD degree at the Department of Biolog-
ical and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki,
Finland. The project is funded by the Academy of Fin-
land, and the supervisors are Drs Riitta Savolainen and

The PhD projects will be expanded around the fol-
lowing topics: (1) Molecular systematics and social
parasite-host relationships of Myrmica, and (2) Phy-
logeography and speciation of Myrmica rubra and itssocial parasite M. microrubra; for background infor-
mation, please see PNAS 100:7169-74, 2003. The ﬁrst
project will include, among others, supervised collect-
ing of Myrmica in the Holarctic region and sequencing
of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The second project
involves supervised collecting of phylogeographic sam-
ples of Myrmica rubra and its social parasite M. mi-
crorubra in Europe, DNA sequencing, microsatellite
analyses, and behavioural mating experiments.
We seek candidates with a background in ecology and
evolutionary biology. Experience in generating DNA
sequence and microsatellite data and analyzing them is
of great advantage but not necessary to qualify for the
positions. We expect strong commitment to the work
by the selected candidates.
The monthly salary will be ca. 1700 euros, equivalent
to the present Finnish graduate school salary.

2 PhD studentship positions: in Symbiosis, Evolution,
Evolutionary and Population Genomics- University of
Lausanne, Switzerland
We are seeking 2 highly motivated students who are
interested in Evolutionary Biology and Symbiosis to
join our group working on mechanisms of evolution in
symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. These important fungi
form mutualistic symbioses with plant roots and form
large underground hyphal networks, where one individ-
ual connects plants of many diﬀerent species. The fungi
help plants to grow by providing essential nutrients. Al-
though the fungi grow clonally, they have a highly un-
usual genome organization, harbouring genetically dif-
ferent nuclei that are passed from one generation to
the next (see Hijri & Sanders, Nature 2005; Kuhn, Hi-
jri & Sanders, Nature 2001). The goals of our research
are to understand how this unusual organization of the
genome aﬀects their evolution and their adaptation to
the diﬀerent environments oﬀered by the roots of diﬀer-18 EvolDir February 1, 2005
ent plant species. Other than their unusual genome or-
ganization, the fungi have formed symbioses with plants
ever since they colonized land over 400 million years
ago and are thought to be the oldest putative ancient
asexuals.
We hope to recruit one PhD student with an evolution-
ary or population biology background and the other
should be familiar with molecular biology and have
an interest in applying this knowledge to evolution-
ary questions. He/she should also be able to inter-
act with the other group members who have lab-based
projects on evolution and population biology of mycor-
rhizal fungi (see list of recent papers and our web site).
The successful candidates will be located in the De-
partment of Ecology and Evolution at the University
of Lausanne (Switzerland). The Dept. of Ecology and
Evolution in Lausanne is situated on the shores of Lake
Geneva and provides a pleasant & exciting research en-
vironment and a strong PhD program. It is also one of
the largest institutions in Europe for research in ecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology, comprising 17 diﬀerent
research groups. A genomics research centre has also
been recently established at the same site.
The 2 PhD studentships are funded by the Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation for a period of 3 years. Start-
ing date is negotiable. Applicants should contact Ian

land.:
PhD. Position in behavioural ecology
I’m oﬀering a PhD position on the behavioural ecol-
ogy of free living European mammals, to be based at
the Institute of Zoology, Department of Biology at the
University of Neuchˆ atel, Switzerland, starting April,
1st. 2005. Neuchˆ atel is a beautiful little city in the
French speaking part of Switzerland, at the foot of the
Jura mountains, with a big lake, and the Swiss Alps in
the background. The major Swiss cities Z¨ urich, Bern,
Basel, Lausanne and Geneva are all within 90 min dis-
tance. The salary will be at 30,000 SFr per year for aperiod of 4 years. The behavioural ecology group has
been set up very recently in 2004, and we are currently
developing our research proﬁle. As a consequence, I do
have two potential topics for the successful applicant to
do his/her research (see below) but own suggestions by
applicants will be considered as well. In any case, the
successful candidate will have freedom in developing the
project him/herself.
First I am interested in life history decisions and tactics
of Alpine marmots, a cooperatively breeding animal. A
research focus would be to test some of the claims about
the importance of helpers experimentally. Further I am
interested in the link between parasites (possibly in col-
laboration with the parasitology group) and costs of re-
production in this species. A second possible research
topic is on feeding behaviour and sociality of Alpine
ibex. In this study the main focus would be on the link
between sociality and group decision making/group co-
hesion with respect to foraging behaviour/ruminating
of diﬀerent age and sex (body size) classes.
The successful applicant is expected to help tutoring
behavioural practicals and excursions during terms.
Knowledge of the French language would be an asset
but not mandatory. Since both projects take place in
the mountains the candidate should be ﬁt and feel com-
fortable working in a harsh environment. Further it
would be an advantage if the applicant had some expe-
rience in studying wildlife. Applications including CV,
ﬁelds of interest and bibliography can be sent by e-mail,

Graduate Research in Evolutionary Physiology of
Stalk-Eyed Flies
I have an opening for a Ph. D. graduate student inter-
ested in research on the performance and ﬁtness conse-
quences of elaborate secondary sexual characters in in-
sects using stalk-eyed ﬂies as a model. Stalk-eyed ﬂies
provide the ideal model system to test for costs and
tradeoﬀs related to male ornamentation. All species
in this extraordinary family display exaggerated head
morphology, with eyes and antennae displaced at the
end of long stalks, and interspeciﬁc variation in eye span
can be more than ten-fold. Furthermore, all available
evidence indicates that eye stalks are critical sexual sig-
nals used in both male-male competition and female
choice. This study will examine the eﬀects of elon-
gated eye stalks on ﬂight performance and survivor-
ship of stalk-eyed ﬂies to assess whether these eﬀects
run counter to the eﬀects of sexual selection. The po-

The research unit Biogeco (Biodiversity, Genes and
Ecosystems) at INRA-University Bordeaux I oﬀers a
permanent position (CR2 INRA) in epidemiology.
Research theme Because of their relative simplicity (of-
ten involving an interaction between two species only),
host-parasite systems are stimulating biological models
for theoretical research in ecology. Yet their functioning
may be crucial because of their possible negative impact
on human, or human related, activities (forestry, agri-
culture.). As a consequence of high levels of human
interference, these systems evolve in a rapidly changing
environment at both local (changes in silvicultural prac-
tises, for example) and global (increase of exchanges
and introductions of pathogens, climate change, etc)
scales. In order to understand and forecast the evolu-
tion of forest pathosystems (interactions between trees
and pathogens, mostly fungi) the objective of this new
position is to strengthen theoretical work in evolution-
ary ecology and modelling and to complement ongoing
research focused on the development of an experimental
approach to understand the functioning of these biolog-
ical systems. The candidate is expected to have an in-
terest in theoretical (community ecology, evolutionary
ecology of parasitism) as well as applied (risk analysis)
ﬁelds of research.
Scientiﬁc environment The successful candidate will
work in close collaboration with the researchers in
the pathology group (3 epidemiologists, 1 popula-
tion geneticist, 1 modeller in ecology/theoretical biol-
ogy), have opportunities to interact closely with ge-
neticists and ecologists in the research unit, Biogeco,
and will become integrated into a local network for
modelling in epidemiology, genetics and ecology (UMR
Biogeco, UMR Sant´ e V´ eg´ etale (Plant Health), INRA-
ENITAB, Laboratory of Applied Mathematics in Uni-
versity of Bordeaux I). http://www.pierroton.inra.fr/-

Discussion lists
Dear friend,
Do you know about a good discussion list on evolu-
tionary biology ? I interested in a list to discuss the
evolutionary mechanisms, the history of evolutuionary
biology, creation versus evolution and also about teach-
ing material !
Also, I am interested in real articles (not websites) dis-
cussing the creation X evolution debate! I need real
published material to use with my students.
Could you help me plase ?
Thanks !!

Evol Meeting ProposalsDear Colleagues,
- Have you long dreamed of a grand enterprise that can
only be addressed by large-scale collaboration? - Would
the results from other ﬁelds be greatly more relevant to
your work if they you could make a slight change to
their research program? - Is there a group of scientists
that you are dying to get in a room and pepper with
questions? - Would you like to make the case to in-
dividuals in another ﬁeld that your work can advance
theirs?
The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NES-
Cent) announces a call for meeting proposals, with a
deadline of March 15, 2005 http://www.nescent.org/-
nescent/Meetings.html Cross-Disciplinary Network
Catalysis Meetings
These one-time meetings of ?30 scientists from diverse
disciplines to focus on a major question or research
area. These meetings are intended to identify avenues
for synthesis, and classes of primary data that must be
collected before grand-scale synthesis is possible. These
meetings are intended to increase the scale and ambi-
tion of our scientiﬁc vision. By allowing interaction
beyond the “usual suspects”, these meetings will facil-
itate the assembly of networks to collect the primary
data needed for synthesis, and networks that will apply
for funding such as NSF Research Coordination Net-
works or NESCent’s “working groups” (see below).
Working Group Meetings
Working Groups involve small groups of scientists (10-
12 participants) collaborating intensively on the anal-
ysis or synthesis of data, models or both, to address
a major question in evolutionary biology, or to solve
a particular analytical problem.? The working groups
will typically meet 3 times over two years (a 4th meet-
ing can be requested later). Each meeting may last
between 4-10 days.? NESCent will not fund collection
of new data or ﬁeld research, but encourages the mining
of public and private databases. Products from working
groups might include (but are not restricted to) - Syn-
thetic papers and reviews - Databases allowing others
to build on the foundation you lay - Software or math-
ematical tools that solve a major analytical problem

Evolution games
I’m a computer science PhD student working on an edu-
cational software project centered around natural selec-
tion/evolution. As a ﬁrst step, we’re trying to gather as
much information about *existing* games in this vein
as we can. We’re aware of GenScope and MIT’s Live
Long and Prosper, but we were wondering if there are
other examples out there that you’re aware of. Mind
you, we’re just as interested in “bad” examples as “good
examples” - we’d rather not reproduce the mistakes of
others, if possible! If you’re moved to make a com-
mentary on the game(s) with respect to their accu-
racy/educational utility, that would be appreciated as
well. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help us
with this!

evolution/index.html The new Monkey Trial
By persuading the Dover, Pa., school board to teach
creationism, Christian zealots have provoked a show-
down over the status of not just evolutionary theory,
but science itself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - By Michelle Goldberg
Jan. 10, 2005 |DOVER, Pa. – It was an ordinary
springtime school board meeting in the bedroom com-
munity of Dover, Pa. The high school needed new bi-
ology textbooks, and the science department had rec-
ommended Kenneth Miller and Joseph Levine’s “Bi-
ology.” “It was a fantastic text,” said Carol “Casey”
Brown, 57, a self-described Goldwater Republican and
the board’s senior member. “It just followed our cur-
riculum so beautifully.”
But Bill Buckingham, a new board member who’d re-
cently become chair of the curriculum committee, had
an objection. “Biology,” he said, was “laced with Dar-
winism.” He wanted a book that balanced theories ofevolution with Christian creationism, and he was will-
ing to turn his town into a cultural battleﬁeld to get
it.
“This country wasn’t founded on Muslim beliefs or evo-
lution,” Buckingham, a stocky, gray-haired man who
wears a red, white and blue cruciﬁx pin on his lapel, said
at the meeting. “This country was founded on Chris-
tianity, and our students should be taught as such.”
Casey Brown and her husband, fellow board member
Jeﬀ Brown, were stunned. “I was picturing the head-
lines,” Jeﬀ said months later.
“And we got them,” Casey added.
Indeed, by the end of 2004, journalists from across the
country and from overseas had come to Dover to re-
port on the latest outbreak of America’s perennial war
over evolution. By then, Buckingham had succeeded
in making Dover the ﬁrst school district in the coun-
try to mandate the teaching of “intelligent design” –
an updated version of creationism couched in modern
biological terms. In doing so, he ushered in a legal chal-
lenge from outraged parents and the ACLU that could
turn into a 21st century version of the infamous “Scopes
Monkey Trial.”
The Dover case is part of a renewed revolt against evo-
lutionary science that’s been gathering force in Amer-
ica for the past four years, a symptom of the same
renascent fundamentalism that helped propel George
Bush to victory. Since 2001, the National Center for
Science Education, a group formed to defend the teach-
ing of evolution, has tallied battles over evolution in 43
states, noting they’re growing more frequent.
After 1987, when the Supreme Court declared the
teaching of creationism in public school unconstitu-
tional in Edwards vs. Aguillard, the doctrine seemed
to be shut out of public schools once and for all. In
the last few years, though, intelligent design has given
evolution’s opponents new hope. Now, emboldened by
their growing political power, religious conservatives are
once again storming the barricades of science education.
The same month Bush was reelected, the rural Grants-
burg, Wis., school district revised its curriculum to al-
low the teaching of creationism and intelligent design.
After a community outcry – including a letter of protest
from 200 Wisconsin clergy – the district revised the pol-
icy but continued to mandate that students be taught
“the scientiﬁc strengths and weaknesses of evolutionary
theory,” a common creationist tactic that fosters the il-
lusion that evolution is a controversial theory among
scientists.
Other anti-evolution initiatives have aﬀected entire38 EvolDir February 1, 2005
states. In the November election, creationists took over
the Kansas Board of Education. The last time the
board had a majority, in 1999, it voted to erase any
mention of evolution from the state curriculum. Kansas
became a laughingstock and the anti-evolutionists were
defeated in the next Republican primary, leading to
the policy’s reversal. Now, newly victorious, the anti-
evolutionists plan to introduce the teaching of intelli-
gent design next year.
Similarly, this past December, the New York Times re-
ported that Missouri legislators plan to introduce a bill
that would require state biology textbooks to include
at least one chapter dealing with “alternative theories
to evolution.” Speaking to the Times, state Rep. Cyn-
thia Davis seemed to compare opponents of intelligent
design to al-Qaida. “It’s like when the hijackers took
over those four planes on Sept. 11 and took people to
a place where they didn’t want to go,” she said. “I
think a lot of people feel that liberals have taken our
country somewhere we don’t want to go. I think a lot
more people realize this is our country and we’re going
to take it back.”
Right-wingers in Congress, on talk radio and on cable
TV, are stoking the anti-evolution rebellion, insisting
that academic freedom means the freedom

Dear Colleagues,
I am nevertheless pleased to announce here that El-
sevier/Academic Press has released “The Evolution of
the Genome”, a book edited by T.R. Gregory and con-
taining chapters by numerous prominent genome re-
searchers. I post the announcement here because I
believe the subject matter of the book will be of con-
siderable interest to many EvolDir members and their
students.
In brief, the volume covers most of the major issues in
genome evolution, reviews these topics in an integra-
tive manner, provides important conceptual and his-
torical context in addition to prospects for future re-
search, and is written in such a way as to make the
material accessible to young researchers, postdocs, ad-
vanced grad students, and researchers in related ﬁelds.
I also did my best to ensure that, despite the length
(740pp), the price would remain accessible to postdocs,
students, and others who can’t write it oﬀ as a grant
expense!
For your interest, I include the chapter and au-
thor list below, and invite you to visit http://-
www.genomesize.com/rgregory/book for additional de-
tails.

index.html Judge: Evolution stickers unconstitutional
Markers in science textbooks violated church-state sep-
aration
Thursday, January 13, 2005 Posted: 12:22 PM EST
(1722 GMT)
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) – A federal judge in At-
lanta, Georgia, has ruled that a suburban county school
district’s textbook stickers referring to evolution as “a
theory not a fact” are unconstitutional.
In ruling that the stickers violate the constitutionally
mandated separation between church and state, U.S.
District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled that labeling evo-
lution a “theory” played on the popular deﬁnition of the
word as a “hunch” and could confuse students.
According to The Associated Press, the stickers read,
“This textbook contains material on evolution. Evo-
lution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of
living things. This material should be approached with
an open mind, studied carefully and critically consid-
ered.”
The disclaimers were put in the books by school oﬃcials
in 2002.“Due to the manner in which the sticker refers to evo-
lution as a theory, the sticker also has the eﬀect of un-
dermining evolution education to the beneﬁt of those
Cobb County citizens who would prefer that students
maintain their religious beliefs regarding the origin of
life,” Cooper wrote in his ruling.
Cooper said he was ruling on the “narrow issue” of the
case, brought against the Cobb County School District
and Board of Education by four parents of district stu-
dents, was whether the district’s stickers violated the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
His conclusion, he said, “is not that the school board
should not have called evolution a theory or that the
school board should have called evolution a fact.”
“Rather, the distinction of evolution as a theory rather
than a fact is the distinction that religiously moti-
vated individuals have speciﬁcally asked school boards
to make in the most recent anti-evolution movement,
and that was exactly what parents in Cobb County did
in this case,” he wrote.
“By adopting this speciﬁc language, even if at the direc-
tion of counsel, the Cobb County School Board appears
to have sided with these religiously motivated individ-
uals.”
The sticker, he said, sends “a message that the school
board agrees with the beliefs of Christian fundamental-
ists and creationists.”
“The school board has eﬀectively improperly entangled
itself with religion by appearing to take a position,”
Cooper wrote. “Therefore, the sticker must be removed
from all of the textbooks into which it has been placed.”
Five parents of students and the American Civil Liber-
ties Union had challenged the stickers in court, arguing
they violated the constitutional separation of church
and state.
The case was heard in federal court last November.
The school system defended the warning stickers as a
show of tolerance, not religious activism as some par-
ents claimed.
“The Cobb County school board is doing more than
accommodating religion,” Michael Manely, an attorney
for the parents, argued during the trial, according to a
report from The Associated Press. “They are promot-
ing religious dogma to all students.”
Lawyers for Cobb County, however, argued in court
that the school board had made a good-faith eﬀort to
address questions that inevitably arise during the teach-
ing of evolution.
“Science and religion are related and they’re not mutu-40 EvolDir February 1, 2005
ally exclusive,” school district attorney Linwood Gunn
said in an AP report. “This sticker was an eﬀort to get
past that conﬂict and to teach good science.”
According to the AP, the schools placed the stickers af-
ter more than 2,000 parents complained the textbooks
presented evolution as fact, without mentioning rival
ideas about the beginnings of life.

Hampton L Carson 1914-2004
With great sadness I pass on the news that Professor
Hampton L. Carson died December 13, 2004, about ﬁve
weeks after his 90th birthday. He is perhaps best known
for his work on chromosomal evolution and speciation,
particularly the founder principle, which arose from his
deep knowledge of the Hawaiian Drosophila. The range
of his contributions to evolutionary genetics is found in
his over 250 publications produced over a period of 70
years, the most recent appearing in 2003. Many of his
ideas were the subject of a symposium held in honor of
his retirement (1).
Many of Hamp’s papers (1921-1993) are in the

ety, Philadelphia <www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/-

Human mitochondrial database
mtDB
mtDB is a database for complete human mitochondrial
genomes and is intended for use in both human pop-
ulation genetics and medical genetics. This site has
been up for 4 years now but there seem to be plenty of
researchers that don’t know about it.
http://www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB Of the more than
2000 complete, or near complete, mitochondrial
genomes that have been published to date, less than
half are available through GenBank. As far as I know,
our website is the only place online where many can
be obtained. Not only are all the sequences available
here but also a compilation of all variable sites among
these (currently 2056) sequences. It is also possible to
identify which sequences vary at each site. We have
recently added a search function where one can input
up to 10 criteria of site/variant and output a list of
sequences that match. This can be useful, for exam-
ple, for identifying sequences that fall in to a particular
haplogroup.

Isolation by distance
Dear all,
I wish to test for isolation-by-distance amongst popu-
lations of a stream- dwelling salmonid. In many pub-
lished papers this is approached by testing for a pos-
itive correlation between Fst and distance. However,
other authors perform this test using 1/(1-Fst) instead
of Fst, following Rousset (1997). Can someone advise
me which is the correct test statistic, and why?
Thank you.

LongnoseDace samples
Hi.
I am a PhD student working on a phylogeography of
the longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), a common
cyprinid of North American rivers. I have performed
an extensive sampling of the Quebec rivers (Quebec,
Canada) and in order to conﬁrm the post-glacial ori-
gin of those populations, I need samples from Mis-
souri/Mississipi or Great Lakes watersheds, from the
northeastern part of Ontario as well as from the At-
lantic region (Canada and/or USA).
I would be grateful if anyone would be able to pro-
vide me with DNA and/or conserved tissue/specimen
(preferably in 95% ethanol) from those localities. If you
are able to provide me with any of the above samples
or know of anyone that might be able to help, I would
appreciate your feedback.
Please contact me to the address given below.
Thank you very much for your help!

MapMarker 1000
Dear evoldir list,
We are considering using the MapMarker 1000 size
standard made by Bioventures to score microsatellite
loci with alleles larger than 500bp on the ABI 3130.
Has anyone had experience using this product or an-
other size standard that will score alleles up to 600bp?
Thank you, Caren Goldberg
gold0191@uidaho.edu gold0191@uidaho.eduMapMarker1000 answers
Dear evoldir list,
Below are the responses to my inquiry about Map-
Marker1000 ladder. Thank you to everyone who re-
sponded, your comments were very helpful. I am now
trying a free sample of MapMarker on our new 3130xl.
In summary, some researchers are pleased with the re-
sults of this size standard while others are unsatisﬁed.
Speciﬁc advice was to increase the run time on the ma-
chine and to check every lane for correct size calling.
There were also suggestions for other size standards for
scoring >500bp fragments.
Thanks again, Caren
We use Mapmarker 1000 routinely on the MJ Basesta-
tion (a gel based sequencer) to size microsatelllite alleles
and it works great.
Hi Caren,
My lab uses a custom ladder from Bioventures to score
large fragments for T-RFLP. We really like their prod-
uct: nice consistent, even peak heights and no double
peaks. We’ve run them on a 377 and a 3100.
Lee
I haven’t used MapMarker 1000, but you the attached
reprint details how to make your own size standard that
will allowing scoring of alleles up to 1000 bp...
Good luck,
Andrew DeWoody (DeWoody et al. 2004 was attached)
Caren,
I used MapMarker 1000 to score microsats sized be-
tween 500 and about 900 bp. However, it turned out to
be a major pain because the analysis software consis-
tently made incorrect calls for the size standard peaks.
Therefore, for every LANE I had to check to see if the
size standard had been scored correctly and then cor-
rect the samples that had not been correctly scored. If
the analysis software has been updated and can now
make the correct calls, then I would suggest you go for
it. On the other hand, if the analysis software still can-
not consistently call the peaks of the size standard then
you want to ﬁnd an alternate marker.
-Eric
Caren,February 1, 2005 EvolDir 43
Bioventures markers are very good. I have used them in
the past and they are reliable and consistent. The prob-
lem with marker sets that go up to 1000 basis is that
you get poor resolution and sizing is no longer linear
after 500 basis when using denaturing electrophoresis
conditions. ABI software will not score the fragments
well. If you run the samples on non-denaturing con-
ditions, your migration becomes sequencing dependent
instead of purely based on the size of the fragment. The
3130 (we have one) have not been design with denatur-
ing run in mind. Either way, it might take you a lot of
eﬀort to ﬁne tune things if you need good accuracy on
allele discrimination, specially if they are very close in
size. In the past I have tried working on the issue for
couple of diﬀerent projects but we did not ﬁnd the re-
sults to be satisfactory. I confess we did not spend a lot
of time on it, though. We opted to change marker sets
or redesigning primers, if possible. We got acceptable
results only when overall peak pattern was needed for
AFLP projects and not accurate size calling.
I would appreciated if you would let me know if you
hear from anybody who has consistently been successful
genotyping larger than 500 bp frags on a ABI capillary
machine.
Best wishes,
Helaman
Hi Caren, I’ve had some success using ABI’s ROX dou-
ble stranded 2500bp ladder. I usually label the left
hand peak under denaturing conditions and you’ll have
to contact tech services for sizing as the fragments mi-
grate diﬀerently using this application. I usually change
the default module and run for a further 20 mins using
our ABI3100 machine. I can reproducibly size frag-
ments up to about 2kb. Obviously ABI won’t support
this application so I do this work when the array is at
the end of its lifespan.
Hope this helps you. Jake
Caren,
We have not tried the MapMarker size std, but I have
several pieces of relevant advice for you (size stds are a
frequent topic of discussion in our lab).
I highly recommend The Gel Company’s size stan-
dards. They make a 50-1000 bp std, available in
Rox (MRK1000) or Tamra. We tested their MTK500
(Tamra) and found it to be high quality, very clean,
with sharp peaks, comparable to ABI’s T500XL but a
fraction of the cost. It’s the best size std we tested. The
Gel Co. is very customer-service oriented, too, which
is a bonus.
STAY AWAY from GenSize! We followed instructions,tried multiple gels, and still it looked awful, absolutely
unusable. I can’t believe they sell that stuﬀ!
If making your own size std is an option, see DeWoody
et al. 2004, BioTechniques 37: 348-352 for primer seq
and protocol. We tried this and it worked quite well,
with clean peaks, though it is somewhat labor-intensive.
Posts range from 79-1007 bp but we just used 79-560
because we didn’t need the larger rungs.
Good luck! I would be interested to see other replies to
your query.
Libby
dear Caren,
we successfully used MapMarker 1000 to size microsats
in Cepaea nemoralis, that partly were >600 bp on a

Microsat cloning answers
Dear all,
Thanks everyone who sent comments and suggestions
regarding the microsat cloning problems. Please ﬁnd
the answers below.
John
Hi there,
One way to increase your chance of getting micros with
good ﬂanking sequence is to select for bigger genomic
inserts. Have you tried using diﬀerent restriction en-
zyme combinations? It may be that the particular com-
bination you are using at present is giving you a lot
of small inserts. I would suggest trying other enzyme
combos and/or using a smaller number of restriction
enzymes to increase the size of your gemomic inserts.
There may well be another reason why you are getting
this pattern but looking enzyme choice is a relatively
easy thing to play with when trying to solve problems
like this.
Good luck Andy Given
Hi John
I am not sure if that post was our lab or not, but we did
have similar questions. I t has been awhile since I’ve
done that procedure, and my responses are not much
more then semi-educated guesses, but here goes. First
are your inserts relatively short on average? We are
working with copepods, and qualitatively the genomes
are probably fairly diﬀerent at times, but I noticed thatmany of our msats were surrounded by other imperfect
msats, or what might be called ’simple sequence’. It is
highly repetitive DNA, but not perfectly repetitive. I
did not test it directly but it was obviously fairly far
from random at times. This could restrict the number
of restriction sites to less (or more) then we might ex-
pect by chance, and since everything was fairly repet-
itive primer design was a nightmare. Also there are
a great number of selective steps in that enrichment
process; multiple PCR ampliﬁcations, and the cloning
itself are going to be selective for products or inserts
of a smaller size. Hence, small fragments will amplify
more in the genome ampliﬁcation and any ampliﬁca-
tion after enrichment. During cloning it seems smaller
fragments will be taken up preferentially, as well as the
possibility that clones with larger fragments, that tend
to be repetitive, could grow slower.
Some or none of these situations may be occurring, and
I am sure we could all keep on guessing about why, so
here a few of the things we did.
The key for us was increasing average insert size that
we sequenced and just doing a lot of enrichments. We
tried diﬀerent enzymes ﬁrst judging just by the amount
of digestion, and if that went well, then by the quality
of the fragments we were getting back. Second, we no-
ticed that we got more large fragments from freshly
transformed cells. The frequency of large inserts went
down each day they waited in the fridge before they
were grown up and prepped. Third, and I think one of
the most important was we began to screen our clones
before we sequenced them. By screening I mean for size.
When picking colonies we put one toothpick stab in LB
to be grown up over night and another stab from the
same colony was put into water agitated then boiled,
spun down, chilled, and a few microliters added to a
PCR rxn with M13 primers. We then only chose to
prep the clones with fragments over 700 bp, about 200
bp were plasmid so 500 bp or more was our target. We
did 650 or 600 if we were desperate. There are prob-
ably many things you could do within the protocol to
address your situation, and someone will probably men-
tion some of them who knows more then I. However
our approach was to clone like mad, prep them early,
and only prep and sequence the biggest ones. Once
you have the enrichment dialed in for your organism, it
seemed more time and cost eﬃcient to just keep making
libraries, using the ones that seemed to have a better
return and using only the largest fragments. Our best
looking msats were undoubtedly butted up to the re-
striction site or comprised only a short almost repetitive
bit of sequence to work with for designing primers.
Dennis L. PetersonFebruary 1, 2005 EvolDir 45
Dear colleague
I am just leaving town for a couple of days , and I dont
have time to look into your protocol, but it look similar
to the ones I have used. I had that problem also. It
was solved after using a probe in the enrichment step
modiﬁed in the 5’ so that it could not work as a primer
in the PCR at th end of the enrichment step.
This is well described in the by Kobl´ ızkov´ a et al .
(1998), see the reference in the primer note I am send-
ing in attach. This solved the problem for many people
out there. What you are getting is sequences that start
in the mast region because in the PCR step the probe
(the probe should not reach that step but it does!) is
working as a primer annealing to the msat region of
your sequences and thus starting the sequence rihgth
there!

PCR ampliﬁcation answers
Hello,
Here are the ﬁrst replies on my question considering pcr
ampliﬁcation using ﬂuorescent labelled primers. Ap-
parently a lot of people experience the same problem!
Thank you very much for all the response!
MY QUESTION:
I work with microsatellites and have managed to get
ampliﬁcation for three diﬀerent primer pairs (based on
agarose + EtBr visualisation). Now I wanted to switch
to ﬂuorescent labelled primers (the 5’ of the forward
primer is Hex labelled), and I don’t seem to get any
ampliﬁcation using the same pcr conditions. I havechecked (and doublechecked) and there are no mistakes
in the primer sequence. I also tried diﬀerent primer con-
centrations, but still no ampliﬁcation. I wonder what
could be the cause of my problem, since I have already
had good results with other ﬂuorescent labelled primer
pairs.
Thanks and best wishes
Anja
THE RESPLIES:
Hi Anja – I have just ﬁnished converting 12 loci from
P33 labelling to ﬂourescent labelling. I used a few PCR
reaction mixes when testing each loci to start and found
that tweaking the MgCl2 and TAQ concentrations was
necessary for a few of them. In these cases less TAQ and
a smaller amount of MgCl2 usually increased the PCR
product. All of them that exhibited a nice product on
agarose gels are working ﬁne upon genotyping. These
microsats range in size from about ~100bp to ~250bp.
Good luck. Cheers, Stephanie
——
Dear Anja,
Have you checked your PCR-product using ﬂuorescent
labelled primers on an agarose + EtBr visualisation?
At least you can check whether you have a product or
not. Sometimes primers are not synthesised correct or
cleaned properly.
Best wish
Bo
——
Hi Anja, I never use HEX labelling. The dye gives a
very week signal and I think the ﬂuorescent moiety may
aﬀect the stereo-speciﬁcity of the PCR reaction. If you
need a ’green’ dye try VIC. It performs like 6-FAM and
isn’t problematic. You can run VIC labelled fragments
with ABI’s dye set G5 (LIZ 500-250 ladder) and also D
(ROX 400HD, high density ladder). Hope this helps.
Jake
——
Dear Anja, maybe the ﬂuorescent tags on your primers
are faulty. Can you see any ﬂuorescent signal from them
at all (like primer dimers or left over primer)? If not,
then the tags probably don’t work. Have you tried get-
ting new ones? Good luck, Barbara
——
Dear Anja.
I am sorry that I can’t solve the mystery in order to
help you. I just want to tell you, that I experienced a46 EvolDir February 1, 2005
similar problem for one pair of my primers. In my case
the unlabbeled primer pair performs much better than
do the labelled ones. So, if someone can give you an
answer to that trouble, maybe you can send it to the
EvolDir members as well, thanx very much in advance.
And all the best for your work.
S´ ebastien
——
Dear Anja,
I cannot help you solve the problem, but I would like
to inform you that this also happened to me. I asked
the company which made the labelled primers to send
me new ones (free of charge), but it didn’t help. I just
gave up with these primers.
All the best,
Sophie
——
Hi Anja,
in response to your Evoldir question, apparently ﬂuo-
rescently labelled primer is a diﬀerent molecule (car-
rying label) so indeed it may happen that a ﬂuores-
cently labelled primer may not work as it had as non-
labelled. I don’t really have solution better than re-
design primer. However, sometime there are also man-
ufacturing problems other than primer sequence itself,
e.g. quality of the primer, so perhaps try to re-order
primer. I’ve dealt with a similar problem: my ﬂuores-
cent primers were not as eﬃcient as non-labelled, but
still produced a bit of products. I didn’t have time to
re-design and test new primers, hence, I run PCRs with
non-labelled primers ﬁrst and then these products used
for a few additional PCR cycles with labelled primers
to get it labelled. It worked. I’m uncertain whether it’s
of any use to you, but it may give you an idea perhaps...
good luck
Monika
——
Hi Anja,,
I have had the exact same problem. I was also us-
ing primers tagged with HEX.....I had great PCR re-
sults with my non-ﬂuoresecnt primers and then when
I switched to using the ﬂuorescent primer I saw noth-
ing at all. I’m not sure if something was inhibiting
the reaction or not. I tried everything....changed the
annealing temp, used more taq, changed the concen-
tration of magnesium etc. but nothing worked until I
called the company and they sent me a new ﬂuorescent
primer!! Then it worked ﬁne! I was surprised becausethe sequence was not incorrect...so it must have had
something to do with the ﬂuorescent tag. I would deﬁ-
nitely call them and tell them your problem and likley
they’ll replace it. I am happy to hear that I was not
the only one with this problem. Perhaps HEX is extra
sensitive? They told me to be sure that I resuspended
my HEX primer in 1XTE pH of 8, but I

PCR plates
Does anyone have a recommendation for a 96 well PCR
plate that has wells that have ’etched’ inside surfaces?
To clarify, we are using a protocol to ’clean up’ sequenc-
ing reactions prior to running them through our CEQ
8000 (automated sequencer).
The protocol uses an ETOH precipitation and requires
the plates to be spun, inverted to spin oﬀ the ETOH.
In all of the PCR plates we have tried so far the insideFebruary 1, 2005 EvolDir 47
surface of the tubes is smooth and the DNA pellet does
not remain stuck to the bottom of the tubes (i.e. its
lost with the ETOH).
Ideally these plates would also ﬁt into the sequencer
(that means semi-skirted, chimney topped, notched out
at the A1 corner of the plate).
The sequence manufacturer can provide a plate with
these exact specs but they are incredibly expensive so
I am looking for a cheaper alternative.
Please reply to me directly and I will forward the replies
to anyone that expresses an interest.
Best,

Sankoﬀ wins WeldonMedal
Congratulations to Prof. David Sankoﬀ. He has been
awarded the Weldon Memorial medal for 2004.
This prize was established through the eﬀorts of Karl
Pearson and others almost 100 years ago in memory of
W.R.F. Weldon. It is presented by Oxford University
every year (previously every three years) “without re-
gard to nationality or membership of any university”,
to the person who in the judgment of the Electors has
in recent years published the most noteworthy contri-
bution to Biometric Science (the development of math-
ematical or statistical methods applied to problems in
biology).
Among the previous 35 winners are statisticians and
geneticists RA Fischer, ES Pearson, JBS Haldane, P
Mahalanobis, Sewell Wright, Frank Yates, JD Finney,
Motoo Kimura, MS Bartlett, DG Kendall, LL Cavalli-
Sforza, Robert May, David Cox, John Maynard Smith,
Joe Felsenstein and Warren Ewens. The board of elec-
tors is currently chaired by Robert May.

Golding@McMaster.CASoftware BAPS 3 1
I’d like to inform evolutionary biologists about the re-
lease of BAPS 3.1 upgrade software for analysis of ge-
netic population structure. Main improvements in the
software compared with the earlier version 3.0 are:
1. Better usability, several estimation runs can now be
processed simultaneously, by providing a vector input
to ﬁeld where the maximum number of clusters is spec-
iﬁed. 2. Algorithm improvement, several new search
steps have been added. 3. Possibility to use training
data for specifying the prior for allele frequencies. 4.
Program output has been enhanced.
Please, check the manual for details. The software is

Software Prottest
Dear colleagues,
We have implemented a new program called ProtTest
for the selection of empirical models of amino acid sub-
stitution, which can be downloaded from
http://darwin.uvigo.es ProtTest reads protein align-
ments in Phylip and Nexus formats and calculates AIC,
AICc and BIC values, obtaining a rank of model ﬁts,
model-averaged parameter estimates, or measures of
parameter importance. It is available for Mac OSX,
Linux and Windows, and it can be run in three ways:
using a GUI, at the command-line, and through a web
server.

Software TreeFinder 2
Sorry folks,
I just discovered an error in the November-
TREEFINDER: There is a switch missing in the fron-
tend, which is necessary to estimate the codon po-
sition rates. Those interested in this feature should
get the December version, which is now online at
www.treeﬁnder.de .
By the way - I would like to do a little survey measur-
ing the discontent among scientists. If you like, you can
send me the following data:
(1) Your name.
(2) Your country.
(3) The duration of your professional scientiﬁc career
so far.
(4) The amount of money that you feel that whatever
organization is owing to you for your unpaid work, after
taxes, and summing over your whole scientiﬁc career.
If you feel overpaid, then you may send me a negative
value. In order to make debts comparable in diﬀer-
ent economic environments, please relate your amount
to the price of a house that you would buy in your
country. For example, the Deutsche Forschungsgemein-
schaft is owing me 0.86 houses for my unpaid work on
TREEFINDER. Be as exact as possible. If you have
worked in more than one country, please send me (3)
and (4) for each country separately.
If there is enough response, I will publish the distribu-
tion of these ’felt debts to the average scientist’ on my
webpage. I will not publish your name, it is just toensure that everybody is counted only once. Please tell
all your colleagues about the survey!
I wrote the world’s fastest maximum likelihood phy-
logeny program. I did, what the established bioinfor-
matics community was unable to achieve for years. And
still, nobody feels responsible to support the further
TREEFINDER development by oﬀering me an ade-
quate position in Munich. Look at them! They are
sitting on well-paid and everlasting positions and pre-
vent innovation by keeping young competitors outside.
Am I ridiculous? Or is it the established science? Is
’biologist’ a serious profession or is it just a hobby
for the rich? Is idealism a reliable basis for scientiﬁc
progress? Or does it keep the intelligent people away
from science? Is saying ’yes’ all the time a good strat-
egy in life? Or is it the cause of ridiculous payment and
stupid funding regulations? Should students be warned
against starting a scientiﬁc career? Can anybody tell
me why I should continue this project?
Happy New Year 2005!

Tetraploid SSRdata50 EvolDir February 1, 2005
Dear evoldir,
I am working with microsatellite marker for autote-
traploid plant species. I encountered 1-4 alleles per
individual. Since the genotyping on the basis of al-
lele dosage not working I scored each individual on the
basis of allele presence e.g. one band (150), two band
(150, 154), three band (150, 152, 154) and four band
(150, 152, 154, 156).Last year I put this problem in
this forum for calculating genetic diversity from such
data and the suggestions i got were useful. But now, I
want to perform gene ﬂow study and paternity analysis
from such type of allelic information. For that I have
a population of about 100 trees and all of them were
investigated. From that,10 trees were sampled for har-
vesting seeds (30 seeds per tree). The seeds are half-sib
family and each seed was scored like above example to
perform paternity analysis. The genotypes (allelic in-
formation) of mother trees are known. I would highly
appriciate if any one can suggest me whether there are
some computer software to do gene ﬂow and paternity
analysis from such data sets. Thank you in advance for
your help. Sincerely yours,

old polymer
Hello,
We have a pretty large quantity of polymer for the ABI
3100 on our hands and it’s about to expire. I’m wonder-
ing that if the concern over polymer quality is because
of crystallization, has anyone tried ﬁltering it, much like
you would standard acrylamide?
I’ll be happy to distribute any recommendations I re-
ceive.

MicrobialGenomics
A one year postdoctoral position is available in the
group of Dr. Bernard Labedan “Molecular Evolution
and Genomics”, (see complete address below) on the
following theme. Studying the ﬂuidity of microbial
genomes and reconstructing minimal genomes. The
advent of the complete sequence of numerous micro-
bial genomes has underlined an unexpected variabil-
ity in the panoplys of genes between closely related
species. We have compared exhaustively more than
one hundred genomes of various bacteria, archaea and
fungi and we have built a suite of informatic tools to
identify all orthologues and paralogues. The project
will be to analyse these data in order to identify the
genes which are omnipresent at diﬀerent phylogenetic
and taxonomic levels and those which are speciﬁc to
organisms or groups of organisms. This would allow to
uncover the essential genes which were present in more
and more distant ancestors and to reconstruct the cor-
responding minimal genomes. The expected results will
be important to understand (i) the molecular processes
crucial to gene and genome evolution, (ii) the mecha-
nisms of adaptation to various environments and life
styles, (iii) the process of speciation in microorganisms.
The candidate (under 35) must have a good experience
in Microbiology and a solid knowledge of the informatic
tools used for sequence analysis. He (she) is supposed
(i) to have never worked in France up to now, (ii) to
defend his (her) Doctoral Thesis (PhD level) before the
end of summer 2005. Position is for 12 (minimum) -
18 (maximum) months. The targeted starting date isSeptember 1, 2005, but is ﬂexible. It is part of a special
program provided by the French Ministry of Research
and accordingly any visa procedure will be accelerated.
The salary will be 1830 per month. A Social Security
cover will be provided by the University of Paris-Sud.
There will be no funding for travel expenses. Knowl-
edge of the French language is not required. Any people
interested must contact me ASAP and before the 24th
of Feb. 2005. I need a detailed CV and a short intro-
duction letter.

Our group plan to apply for a post doc position
available at the french ministery research http://-
www.recherche.gouv.fr/appel/2005/acpostdoc.htm the
dead line is the ﬁrst of March
To apply to such project we need a candidate with
bioinformatics /comparative genomics back ground
This is a quick overview of the lab project, note that
the post doc will focuse ine the genome reconstruction
part. For more information see our web site .
http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/evol The project proposed
here is included in the general goal of ou laboratory
To trace back the life story, taking into account the
Earth History. We are focusing on bilaterian metazoan
evolution as well as their genome reconstruction. This
project will allow evidencing the plesiomorphy, the apo-
morphy and the convergence of characters between ac-
tual species. Furthermore, this work will allow better
knowledge neo biology (biology of species living today).
The comparison as well as the evidence of ancestral
organisation will be investigated at several levels: ge-
nomic and post genomic, proteome, interactome, tran-
scriptome and at long term at anatomical and physio-
logical level. In a ﬁrst place we are redrawing the bi-
laterians story by data base and bibliography mining.54 EvolDir February 1, 2005
It will be followed by new analyses, using novel phylo-
genetic tools. We will complete data by cloning of new
markers from phylogenetic new informative species not
well represented in data bases (Rotifer, Gastrotrich&.).
We will also, as far as we can, determine the Urbila-
teria proteome and genome organisation by decipher-
ing the orthologues clusters in the diﬀerent sequenced
(even partially) species (including out group species :
Cnidarians..) and by comparing their genomic organi-
sation. The duplication events in the diﬀerent available
bilaterian lineages will be identiﬁed. Biochemical func-
tional shift of non duplicate orthologues or duplicate
orthologues will be deciphered by phylogenetic analy-
sis. One of the aspects of the biochemical function bee-
ing the protein interaction; the biochemical shift could
be evidence at the interactome level. Deduction of the
ancestral interactome and its evolution in the diﬀer-
ent lineage in regards to duplication will be realized
from known interactome. The deciphering of ancestral
transcriptomes as well as their evolution will be per-
formed by expression analysis of the diﬀerent cluster of
urbiorthologues. We will perform data mining of tis-
sues and cell Expressed Sequence Tags data bases, as
well as micro arrays experiments data bases. Finally,
we will reinvestigate comparisons between Bilaterians
at anatomic and morphologic level. Informations com-
ing out from this project will help to decide new infor-
mative species that kept as much as possible ancestral
character of ancestral state bilaterians model. In turn
these new species will allow us to pursue our quest.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN EVOLUTION-
ARY GENETICS / GENOMICS Three postdoctoral
positions are available in the laboratory of Michael
Lynch, Department of Biology, Indiana University,
Bloomington, Indiana: Molecular evolutionary conse-
quences of recombination and asexuality in Daphnia.
This project takes advantage of the burgeoning set of
genomic tools available for Daphnia pulex (including a
complete-genome sequence, high density genetic map,
microarrays, etc.), as well as the widespread distribu-
tion of asexual and sexual lineages in the study species,
and a ?living-fossil? record that can be extracted from
lake sediments. Numerous subprojects related to this
system are available, as part of a larger NSF FIBR grant
on the role of recombination in evolution. Among other
things, this work is intended to establish Daphnia as a
major model organism for ecological / evolutionary ge-
nomics. Candidates must have strong molecular skills,
and background and/or interest in population genet-
ics. Characterization of spontaneous-mutation proper-
ties in eukaryotes. Taking advantage of several sets
of long-term mutation accumulation lines of several
species (including C. elegans, Daphnia pulex, and S.
cerevisiae), we are attempting to quantify the entire
mutational spectrum at the molecular level, with a
long-term goal of establishing generalities across eu-
karyotes. Other species lineages may be developed for
these purposes, and we are concerned with extending
this work to quantify the transcriptional error rate (i.e,
the proliferation of errors at the mRNA level). Can-
didates must have strong molecular skills. Evolution
of spliceosomal introns and eukaryotic gene process-
ing mechanisms. The goals here are to shed light on
a number of unanswered questions regarding eukary-
otic genes, including those concerned with the origin
and proliferation of introns, the evolution of untrans-
lated regions (UTRs) of genes, and nonsense-mediateddecay and other aspects of mRNA processing. Can-
didates must have strong skills in the area of bioin-
formatics / computational biology and a good work-
ing knowledge of molecular and/or population genet-
ics. All three openings are immediately available and
will remain open until suitable candidates are located.
For immediate consideration, please send email applica-
tions (including a cover letter outlining your interests,
complete CV, and contact information for three indi-
viduals willing to supply evaluations) by 1 March 2005

ASEX 1 position available
Students and researchers interested in the paradox of
sex in evolutionary biology are strongly encouraged to
apply for a research position in the European Union
Marie Curie Research Training Network SEXASEX,
which is co-ordinated by Prof. Dr. Koen Martens,
RBINSc, Brussels. Criteria of eligibility include: EU
citizenship, less than 4 years of research experience for
Young Researchers (YR), less than 10 years for Experi-
enced Researchers (ER), and a willingness to work in a
European country other than the country of origin. We
seek candidates who are enthusiastic about evolution-
ary biology, travelling and living abroad, learning in a
multidisciplinary research environment and working in
teams. All appointments will be for 3 years, YR are
oﬀered PhD positions, ER post-doc positions. YR will
be expected to obtain a PhD at the end of the project.
The application of female candidates is especially en-
couraged; detailed information on child care facilities
at the diﬀerent institutions will be provided upon re-
quest. Aid can be sought if accompanying spouses also
require employment abroad.
Project overview: Sex is the queen of evolutionary
problems. It will be tackled by SEXASEX in a mul-
tidisciplinary approach, providing training and trans-
fer of knowledge for a total of 360 person-months. 10
network researchers (6 young researchers (YR) and 4
experienced researchers (ER)) will receive training in
9 institutions across as many countries. A wide ar-
ray of research tools will provide excellent training op-
portunities, for example through individual career de-
velopment plans, individual tutoring and secondments,
which will be supplemented by participation in courses
and external workshops. Network-wide training will ex-
ploit the extensive experience of the partner institutions
through ﬁve courses and summer schools for all network
researchers. Complementary skills such as management
and communication (verbal, written) will be developed,
and gender awareness will be raised, in two network-
wide meetings. The networks theoretical and empiri-
cal research will apply 13 major approaches, including
novel genomic and karyological approaches, intraspe-
ciﬁc phylogeography, ecology, behavioural studies, GISanalyses and theoretical modelling. With this mul-
tidisciplinary toolkit, SEXASEX will investigate why
sex exists at all, given its evolutionary costs, using the
model organism Eucypris virens, a non-marine ostra-
cod species with both sexual and asexual reproduction.
What determines its gender, what are the genomic con-
sequences of long-term asexuality, what is the cohesive-
ness of a species with mixed reproduction, how do asex-
uals and sexuals compete and what is their historical
zoogeography? The pluralistic approach of SEXASEX
is unique and timely, using highly novel methodologies
and dealing with cutting edge science based on Euro-
pean excellence and tradition. Please refer to http://-

University. The successful applicant will participate
in a USDA funded research project involving 960 F2
pigs generated from a Duroc Pietrain resource popula-
tion established at Michigan State University. The re-
search project has a rich and comprehensive database
containing growth, carcass merit, meat quality and sen-
sory phenotypes as well as genetic marker data on F0,
F1 and F2 pigs. In addition, gene expression microar-
ray data comparing within-litter phenotypic extremes
for loin muscle area and backfat based on a selective
phenotyping experimental design will be available. Ex-
cellent training in statistical genetics is required, par-
ticularly with respect to quantitative trait loci (QTL)
analysis. Experience with multiple trait QTL analysis
and linkage disequilibrium mapping is highly desired.
The ultimate objectives of the project will be to esti-

The position is a one year stipend of 230000 SEK (appr.25000 EUR), with possible extension to another year. It
is funded via grants from the Swedish Research Coun-
cil. The starting date is ﬂexible.
Phenotypic polymorphism is a widespread phe-
nomenon, with examples like males and females in sex-
ual species, and winged and wingless individuals in cer-
tain insects. Variation in so-called personality between
individuals of social species could also be regarded as
phenotypic polymorphism. The project deals with the
the evolution of the alternative phenotypes and, in par-
ticular, with the evolution of systems of phenotype de-
termination. Examples of such systems are genetically
controlled polymorphisms, phenotypic plasticity, and
stochastic (randomizing) polymorphisms. The focus of
the project is on the basic, conceptual issues of the evo-
lution of systems of phenotype determination.
Applicants should have a PhD in a ﬁeld like evolution,
ecology, population genetics, or possibly applied math-
ematics.

ButterﬂyColourPatterns
I am looking for someone to ﬁll a BBSRC-funded
postdoc, to study the genetic basis of colour pat-
terns in mimetic Heliconius butterﬂies. This is a re-
advertisement of a post that has become vacant, and
will be for up to 27 months, starting as soon as possi-
ble.
Project description: This is an exciting opportunity to
investigate the molecular genetic basis of a classic evo-
lutionary system. Heliconius erato and H. melpomene
have evolved over 20 distinct geographic races that are
convergent between the species due to mimicry. This
project aims to identify genes controlling the radiationof H. melpomene and conduct a comparative analysis
with the co-mimic H. erato. We will develop ESTs from
wing tissue sampled at diﬀerent stages in development,
and identify regions of the genome involved in pattern
formation using linkage mapping. Population genetic
analyses and studies of gene expression will then be
used to investigate candidate loci. There is the oppor-
tunity for genomics, population genetics or evo-devo
approaches to this problem that could depend on the
interests of the candidate.
The project will involve collaboration with Mark Blax-
ter and the bioinformatics group at the University of
Edinburgh; Owen McMillan in the University of Puerto
Rico and Richard ﬀrench-Constant at the University of
Bath.

University of Helsinki, Finland
A one-year postdoctoral position is available to study
the evolutionary ecology of territoriality in birds, us-
ing both data analysis and modelling. The starting
date is ﬂexible, as is the ratio of either type of work.
The task is to examine how strategies of breeding site
choice create and modify density dependence and other
population-level phenomena. The position is in the lab
of prof. Hanna Kokko (see www.helsinki.ﬁ/˜hmkokko/-
LEED.html ), where several postgraduate & postdoc-
toral researchers work on combining theoretical devel-
opments and empirical datasets to gain insight on both
evolutionary and ecological processes. This provides a
very good environment for developing theoretical skills
for an interested empiricist, or alternatively, a chance
for a theoretician to learn to apply modelling results to
large datasets.February 1, 2005 EvolDir 61
The main dataset available is a long-term ( >20 years)
collection of breeding records for hundreds of individ-
ually marked guillemots Uria aalge, and this part of
the work will be done in collaboration with researchers
in Scotland (prof. M. Harris and Dr. S. Wanless;
see Kokko et al. 2004 J. Anim. Ecol. 367-376).
There are also possibilities to develop models of mi-
gration and breeding strategies of black-tailed godwits
Limosa limosa that migrate between England and Ice-
land, based on a collaboration between prof. Kokko and
Drs. Jenny Gill and Tomas Gunnarsson and Prof. Bill
Sutherland (University of East Anglia, UK), as well as
to analyze breeding site choice of blue-footed boobies
Sula nebouxii (collaborative partner: Dr. Roxana Tor-
res, UNAM, Mexico).
Successful applicants should have a Ph.D. in evolu-
tion, ecology or a related ﬁeld. We expect someone
with strong analytical skills, with an emphasis on ei-
ther modelling or data analysis. Review of applications
will begin immediately and continue until a candidate
is selected. The annual salary is 31320 EUR.

A postdoctoral position is available to study the behav-
ior and ecology of the western harvester ant, Pogon-
omyrmex occidentalis. The position is in the lab of
Blaine Cole and Diane Wiernasz in the Department of
Biology and Biochemistry and is part of an NSF-funded
project to examine the relation of genetic diversity in
colonies and colony performance in the lab and in the
ﬁeld. The project involves linking physiology, behavior
and colony genetic variability. The research for this po-sition requires making behavioral observations of ants
in laboratory colonies and combining observations of
behavioral tempo and variation with controlled tem-
perature changes. Familiarity with ant behavior is an
advantage, but not a requirement. The research will
be a part of the long-term population study of this ant
in western Colorado, USA and there will be opportu-
nities to develop independent projects. We envision
that the applicant will be involved in all phases of the
project including data collection, analysis and writing
of manuscripts. More information about the project
can be obtained at: www.bchs.uh.edu/˜bcole/pogo/
Successful applicants should have a Ph.D. in evolution,
ecology or a related ﬁeld. We expect someone with
strong analytical skills. The position is available for two
years pending satisfactory progress. The position can
begin as early as May 1, 2005. Review of applications
will begin immediately and continue until a candidate
is selected.

TWO POSTDOC POSITIONS: EVOLUTIONARY
FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS OF HUMANS
Two EU-funded positions will be available starting May
1 (2005) in the group of Henrik Kaessmann at the re-
cently founded Center for Integrative Genomics, Uni-
versity of Lausanne, Switzerland.
We focus on the origin and evolution of primate genes
and gene structures. We are particularly interested
in characterizing the (adaptive) evolution of young
genes in the human genome that originated recently
on the primate lineage and therefore may be relevant
with respect to human/hominoid-speciﬁc phenotypes.
To this end, we explore available data from genomic62 EvolDir February 1, 2005
databases and generate complementary data by exper-
imental analysis.
For more information on the group and our institute
more generally, see the website: http://www.unil.ch/-
cig/page7858 en.html For one of the positions, we are
seeking highly qualiﬁed and motivated applicants with
a background in molecular evolution, who have strong
experimental lab skills in molecular biology, because we
want to functionally characterize newly emerged genes.
However, dedicated biochemists or molecular biologists
with an evolutionary interest are encouraged to apply
as well.
The other position focuses on bioinformatics (data min-
ing) and evolutionary analyses of available genomic
data, which may be complemented by data generated
in our lab. Thus, we seek highly motivated appli-
cants for this position with a background in molecu-
lar evolution and with strong skills in computational
biology (bioinformatics, preferably with experience in
data mining and comparative genome analysis). Statis-
ticians and/or population geneticists with strong pro-
gramming skills and an interest in human evolutionary
genomics are also encouraged to apply.
The positions are available for three years. The salary
is approximately 45,000 Euros per year.
The language of the institute is English, and its mem-
bers form an international group that is rapidly expand-
ing. The institute is in Lausanne, a beautiful city at
Lake Geneva amidst an impressive alpine scenery.
Informal inquiries may be addressed to: Hen-
rik.Kaessmann@unil.ch
Applications including a CV, statement of research in-
terest, copies of relevant publications, and two letters
of recommendation should be emailed or mailed to me
at the address below. Review of applications will begin

UOxford PlantEvol
Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Plant EvolutionDepartment of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford,
UK
“The quantitative genetic architecture of sex allocation
and the selection of combined versus separate sexes in
an annual plant”
Research grant holders: John Pannell (Plant Sciences)
and Robert Freckleton (Zoology)
This is a 3-year research project funded by NERC with
ideally a start date of 1st April 2005, although there
is some ﬂexibility. The successful candidate will join
a small research team in John Pannell’s lab that is di-
recting its eﬀorts at understanding the evolution and
maintenance of plant sexual diversity, largely using as
a model the plant species Mercurialis annua. M. an-
nua displays outstanding variation in its sexual system,
including monoecy, dioecy, and the rare androdioecy.
Much of the recent and ongoing research in the lab
is focused on addressing the importance of population
subdivision and metapopulation dynamics for sexual-
system diversity in the species complex, combining phy-
logenetic and phylogeographic analyses, glasshouse and
ﬁeld experiments, the analysis of population demo-
graphic data at a range of spatial scales in Spain and
north Africa, and population genetic, ecological and
evolutionary modelling. A central aim of the research is
the integration of demographic and ecological research
with population and quantitative genetics, from both a
theoretical and empirical perspective.
The successful applicant for the postdoc position will
work on the quantitative genetic basis of natural vari-
ation in sex allocation in Mercurialis annua, using tra-
ditional approaches (the species is not yet amenable
to marker-based QTL analysis), as well as of variation
in experimental populations under directional selection.
There will be scope for collaboration on other related
projects underway in the lab.
Informal enquiries should be directed to
John.Pannell@plants.ox.ac.uk. For particulars about
the research lab and the current focus of work being
conducted in it, see John Pannell’s website under
’People’ at http://dps.plants.ox.ac.uk/external/
Candidates should have completed, or be about to
complete, a PhD or equivalent in plant population
genetics, ecology and/or evolution. Candidates will
ideally have experience in empirical and/or theoret-
ical research on mating systems and sex allocation,
preferably with respect to plants, and be familiar
with the design, execution and analysis of ﬁeld and/or
glasshouse experiments with plant populations. Expe-
rience of experimental quantitative genetics would be
an advantage.February 1, 2005 EvolDir 63

UQueensland PopEcolGenetics
Postdoc in Population Ecology with an interest in
metapopulation modeling (statistical and process-
based), population genetics and ﬁeld work.
We are very likely to have funds available for a three
year postdoc to work in the Ecology Centre at The Uni-
versity of Queensland www.ecology.uq.edu.au . The po-
sition is tied to a 3-year Australian Research Council
(ARC) Linkage grant part funded by industry (WMC
Pty Ltd). The grant written by Dr Chris Wilcox,
Dr Jessica Worthington Wilmer (Queensland Museum),
Prof Hugh Possingham and Mr Darren Niejalke (WMC
Pty Ltd) was for Dr Wilcox however he now has a job
with CSIRO. The short summary of the grant is:
A Bayesian framework for metapopulation dynamics of
species in endangered communities: integrating demo-
graphic, environmental and genetic data.
Biodiversity conservation is a spatial and temporal
problem. Populations change in time, constrained by
the structure and spatial division of their habitat. This
study will develop a tool that can be used to assess the
inﬂuence of environmental ﬂuctuations and landscape
heterogeneity on the persistence of endemic species in
the mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin. Using
a Bayesian framework to integrate data from diverse
sources, we will develop models for the biodiversity im-
pacts of groundwater withdrawal and climate change
in central Australia. These tools are essential for man-
agement of this ecosystem, which has been listed as
an “endangered community” under the Environmental
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999.
We need to identify an outstanding person so we can
transfer the grant to this person. Dr Wilcox will re-
main involved in the coordination of the grant. We
would prefer someone who:
1. can lead two to four weeks of fairly intense ﬁeld workon Mound Springs snails in the Australian desert 2. can
build, run and test metapopulation models 3. has an
interest and familiarity with the generation and appli-
cation of population genetic data to ecological problems
(speciﬁcally using microsatellite data)
Interested applicants should send the following,
by email, to Prof Hugh Possingham (hposs-
ingham@zen.uq.edu.au) and Dr Chris Wilcox
(c.wilcox@uq.edu.au): 1.Full CV 2.One paragraph

University of California, Davis
Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
playing an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecosystems. The construction of phylo-
genetic trees is becoming a methodology that is well-
deﬁned, with broad agreement on the central issues and
questions. A nearly standard set of topics is now taught
as part of the curriculum at many colleges and univer-
sities. On the other hand, applications of phylogenetic
methods to interesting problems outside of systematicsis an area of special excitement, innovation, and con-
troversy, and perspectives vary widely.
In May, 2005, for the sixth year, we will teach a work-
shop for graduate students interested in applying phylo-
genetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The one-
week course will be an intensive exploration of prob-
lems to which modern phylogenetic tools are being ap-
plied, including topics in biogeography, ecology, con-
servation biology, phylogenomics, functional morphol-
ogy, macroevolution, speciation, and character evolu-
tion. The course leads oﬀ with recent advances in phy-
logenetic methodology, and then turns to methods and
tools that can be brought to bear to address these “ap-
plied” issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held entirely at Bodega Marine Lab
on the Northern California coast, which has extensive
computing resources and on-site housing. The course
format will involve equal parts of lecture, discussion,
and training in software and internet tools. One after-
noon during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips to
local natural areas.
Speciﬁc topics to be covered in the course include:
* Finding, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees; phylogenetic databases * Recent advances in
tree reconstruction: Bayesian inference; stochastic op-February 1, 2005 EvolDir 67
timization strategies; divide-and-conquer methods *
Analysis of character evolution–theory: parsimony,
likelihood and Bayesian approaches; null models and
statistical testing * Analysis of character evolution–
form and function of complex character systems *
Phylogenetic biogeography and phylogeography; coa-
lescent methods for inferring migration rates and pat-
terns * Phylogenetic comparative methods * Phylo-
genetic perspectives on biodiversity and conservation
biology * Data mining of sequence databases for phylo-
genetic analysis * Estimation of divergence times from
sequence data

Prerequisites. Students should have some familiarity
with phylogenetic methods through previous course-
work. Some experience with PAUP, PHYLIP, or other
programs for phylogeny reconstruction will be assumed.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $375. This includes
room and board at BML for the duration of the course.
UC Davis students may take the course for credit and
can apply for a partial waiver of this fee.

GeneticProgramming
A 3-credit hour graduate course on Genetic Program-
ming is being oﬀered online through the University of
Hawaii Outreach College for Spring 2005:ICS 691: Genetic Programming (Topics in Software)
Faculty: Lee Altenberg <altenber@hawaii.edu >De-
partment of Information and Computer Sciences, Uni-
versity of Hawaii at Manoa.
Genetic Programming (GP) is a developing ﬁeld at the
nexus between computer science and evolutionary biol-
ogy. The elements of Darwinian evolution are applied
to populations of computer programs as a method of
automatic programming. Fitness is deﬁned by a high-
level speciﬁcation of the program’s purpose, and varia-
tion is produced by program mutation and recombina-
tion operators. Genetic programming exhibits higher-
order evolutionary phenomena such as robustness and
the evolution of evolvability, and thus may serve not
only as an engineering technique, but as a model evo-
lutionary system for theoretical work.
The course is designed to prepare and engage the stu-
dent as quickly as possible in original research in the
ﬁeld of genetic programming. The subject is presented
at a depth necessary for the student to become familiar
with and evaluate controversies within the ﬁeld, appre-
hend open areas for new research, and engage in orig-
inal research with the goal of publication. The course
is entirely on line and asynchronous.

UVirginia EcolWildlifeDiseases
Dear colleagues:
We could like to announce a summer ﬁeld course on
the Ecology of Wildlife Diseases at the Mountain Lake
Biology Station (May 31-June 24, 2005). This course
will focus on the ecology and evolution of parasites in
wild animal populations. We will emphasize hands-on
experience with ﬁeld and laboratory techniques, includ-
ing capture and examination of insects, birds, amphib-
ians, small mammals and other wildlife near MLBS.
The Mountain Lake Biological Station is a dynamic
research and teaching environment formally aﬃliatedwith the University of Virginia, and located in the Ap-
palachian Mountains.
Please see the attached PDF ﬂyer for more information
on this course, and post or forward to both graduate
and advanced undergraduate student who might be in-
terested in this experience.
Tuition scholarships and service awards that cover room
and board are available. For more information on tu-
ition, fees and an online application see: www.mlbs.org
.
Thank you for helping us advertise this opportunity!

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.70 EvolDir February 1, 2005
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
