The Qbio initiative in Institut Pasteur (Paris) is organ-
ising a fully hybrid symposium that willl take place
in Institut Pasteur on Monday and Tuesday December
12th and 13th.
MeMoDEvo: Mechanics Morphogenesis Development
and Evolution
How can mechanics constrain the evolution of shape or
be a source of morphogenetic innovation ? The Qbio
initiative at Institut Pasteur is organising a two-day
symposium in the campus on December 12th and 13th
2022 which will cover the interplay between mechanics,
evolution, morphogenesis and development. This inter-
disciplinary symposium will combine a large range of ap-
proaches (morphometric analysis, modeling, soft-matter
physics, comparative morphogenesis, epistemology) and
diverse organisms (plants, yeast, algae, cnidarians, in-
sects and vertebrates) with diverse and excellent speak-
ers. This symposium is meant to be an open platform
for discussion between physicists, mathematicians and
biologists on relevant biological questions, and to fos-
ter interactions between topics/systems which normally
have few occasions to interact.
The meeting will be in a fully hybrid format, with an
in-person audience and speakers, as well as a virtual
audience and virtual talks.
Two morning sessions will be dedicated to open dis-
cussions in sub-groups on site while afternoon seminar
sessions will be fully hybrid.
The full program can be found on our website https://-
neuroanatomy.github.io/MeMoDEvo .
Registration is free but mandatory (before November14th): https://forms.gle/TTLdHmJf1Ajr8bvr9 If you

methods in phylogenetic systematics. This is one of the
most relevant meetings in the eld, and for the rst
time will be held in Latin America.Most of the activities will take place at the main cam-
pus of UNAM, which is a UNESCO World Heritage
site. The opening reception will be held at the National
Biodiversity Pavilion, a newly inaugurated, one-of-a-
kind venue that combines public museum exhibits with
state-of-the-art research in biodiversity. The closing
ceremony will be held at the Palace of Medicine, at the
Historic Center of Mexico City, which housed the School
of Medicine in the XIX century, and represents one
of the best examples of architecture from the colonial
period.
Contributions for the meeting will be in two categories,
lightning talks and posters. During the meeting forums
and keynote talks on cutting edge phylogenetics will be
presented, and pre- and post-meeting workshops will be
held.

Online CIGENE CodEvolution
Oct26
Hi all,
The next CIGENE seminar is in just one week and we
are pleased to welcome Helle Tessand Baalsrud, who
will tell us about \The evolution of genomic structural
variation in Atlantic cod populations"
Abstract: Genomic structural variants (SVs) can have
profound evolutionary consequences in a species through
gains, losses and rearrangement of DNA. In Atlantic cod
four large chromosomal inversions have been identied
and shown to act as supergenes linked to dierences in
migratory behavior and physiology between co-occurring
populations. However, it is unknown to which extent
structural variation in general facilitates local adapta-
tion in Atlantic cod. To answer this question, we have
sequenced the whole genome of 885 individuals from
across the range of this species and characterized SVs,
including inversions, duplications and deletions. We
demonstrate extensive structural variation in Atlantic
cod, including complex nested SV loci. By scanning the
genome for dierentiated SVs between populations we
identify several candidate SVs linked to local adapta-
tion. Furthermore, we have investigated how SVs shape
the evolution of dierent genomic regions, from coding
sequences to putative regulatory regions. This bringsNovember 1, 2022 EvolDir 7
us closer to reveal how structural variation underpins
genome evolution in the enigmatic Atlantic cod.
Time: Wednesday, Oct 26th, 12-13PM in Norway time.

Online CIGENE Oct12
Hi all,
The next CIGENE seminar is in just one week and we
are pleased to welcome Justin Merondun, who will tell
us about \Population and evolutionary genetics of host
specialization in common cuckoos"
Abstract: Coevolutionary arms races are often respon-
sible for generating extreme phenotypic diversication.
Fueled by positive feedback between highly specialized
parasites and their attuned hosts, avian brood para-
sites provide an excellent system to understand the
coevolutionary pressures generating phenotypic diver-
sication. Common cuckoos, an obligate brood para-
site, exhibit striking egg diversity across Eurasia which
closely mimics their hosts. Here, we examine population
and evolutionary genetic patterns perpetuating host spe-
cialization in common cuckoos and quantify the selective
forces underlying egg diversication, allowing them to
exploit hosts across the continent from the British Isles
to the South China Sea. Time: Wednesday, Oct 12th,
12-13 CET For more information, check out the semi-
nar website: https://cigene.no/cigene-seminar-series/

CoralPopGen
Hi all,
The next CIGENE seminar is in just one week and we
are pleased to welcome Kenji Takata, who will tell us
about \ Population genetic analysis for deep-sea corals
(mesophotic and continental shelf area) in Japan using
genome-wide SNP data "
Abstract: While corals play an important role in increas-
ing biodiversity by providing complex habitat structures
for other species, they are highly threatened due to var-
ious factors (ex. climate change and over-shing). We
examined spatial genetic structure of two types of corals
(precious corals and reef-building corals) aiming for their
conservation. First, we applied a genome-wide SNP anal-
ysis called MIG-seq to reveal spatial genetic structure
and species boundaries in precious corals that can be
found at depths of 100 to 300 m in Japan. Secondly,
we examined 3 dimensional genetic structure of reef-
building coral, Seriatopora hystrix that inhabits up to
50 m depth in Ryukyu Islands.
Time: Wednesday, Oct 19th, 12-13 CET. For more

This year's conference will include a satellite workshop
on how to apply the STRANGE guidelines (https://-
doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-01751-5), a new framework
for animal behaviour research that will help to avoid
sampling bias and to improve data reproducibility. An
extra (free) registration is necessary to participate in this
workshop: https://forms.gle/7MneWBULxqicR1W96.
From these registrations, we will pick several partici-
pants willing to take part in the discussion with the
STRANGE authors about the issues our community
often faces when reporting animal behaviour and what
can be done about it. Let us know in the form if you
would like to be chosen to act as one such representative
of our community and interact live with the authors.
Our organisation is small (we are 7 early career re-
searchers working on a voluntary basis) and the success
of this event is based on the support of our community.
For this reason, we would be particularly grateful if
you could spread the word about this event to your
colleagues and collaborators who you think may benet
from participating in the congress. If you have a twitter
account, you can also follow us (@AnimalBehavLive)
and RT our announcement about the congress.
We would like to thank you for your help and hope to
see you at the Animal Behaviour Live: Annual Online
Conference 2022.

CrustaceanEvolution May22-25
Hello fellow evolutionary biologists,
On behalf of Kareen Schnabel, I want to share an ex-
citing conference for 2023. Do you love crustaceans?
Do you love New Zealand? Why not combine these
and attend the 10th International Crustacean Congress
where the two will converge to bring together carcinolo-
gists at the National Museum of New Zealand Te Papa
Tongarewa in Wellington.
Please consider attending this exciting event and to
learn all about the congress please visit this website
here: *www.ICC10.org* Need funding? Opportu-
nities for travel awards are available here: http://-
www.thecrustaceansociety.org/scholarship.php (please
note the message below.)
Due to the International Crustacean Congress 10 (ICC)
starting at May 2023 in New Zealand, the deadline ofthe student travel awards applications to this meeting
is shifted to the end of January 2023 (NOT 15 March
2023). After the TCS committee meeting, we decided
the number of awards is increased from 5 to 10, and the
amount for each award is increased from 500 USD to
1000 USD, due to the long distance travel. We encour-
age student members to apply for this travel award to
support the travel costs to New Zealand.
Look forward to seeing you all there,
Heather Bracken-Grissom (North American Governor
for the Crustacean Society)

We are now accepting applications for our Ph.D. in
Comparative Biology Program and Graduate Fellow-
ships Program at the American Museum of Natural
History's Richard Gilder Graduate School for Fall 2023.
Deadline: December 15, 2022.
The AMNH Ph.D. Program in Comparative Biology is
training the next generation of biologists through an in-
tegrative approach focused on the history, evolutionary
relationships, and interactions among species. It builds
on the Museum's strength and experience in research
and training, educating a new generation of scientists to
become leaders in understanding the history and diver-
sity of life on Earth and in disseminating their work in
ways that will support advances in biological research,
human health, biodiversity conservation, and other re-
lated elds. This is an accelerated program, designed
for students to complete their degrees in four years. The
Richard Gilder Graduate School will typically provide
full nancial support to students matriculating in the
Comparative Biology Ph.D. Program.
We also oer Ph.D. Graduate Fellowships for students
interested in earning a Ph.D. at one of our partner in-
stitutions. The AMNH Graduate Student Fellowship
Program is an educational partnership with selected uni-
versities, dedicated to the training of Ph.D. candidates
in those scientic disciplines practiced at the Museum.
Our current collaborations are with Columbia University,
City University of New York (CUNY), Cornell Univer-
sity, Stony Brook University, and New York University
(NYU). The host university in which the student enrolls
exercises educational jurisdiction over the students andformally awards the degree. In these partnership pro-
grams, at least one Museum curator must serve as a
graduate advisor, co-major professor or major professor,
and adjunct university faculty member. Each student
benets by having the sta and facilities of both the
university and the Museum to support his/her training
and research. To be eligible for the AMNH Graduate
Fellowship, students must apply to both the host Uni-
versity's Ph.D. program and to the AMNH Graduate
Student Fellowships Program. Students already matric-
ulated in a Ph.D. program are not eligible to apply; only
new, rst-time Ph.D. applicants will be considered.
Students who plan to apply to both the RGGS Com-
parative Biology Ph.D. Program and to the Graduate
Fellowship Program complete one single application,

PredictingAdaptiveEvolution
Graduate (PhD) position
Predicting evolution in complex adaptive landscapes
1.Basic job and project description:
- Paid 4 year position to do a PhD in the Autonomous
University of Barcelona (UAB).
- Topic: Mathematical modeling of evolution in complex
adaptive landscapes. This implies modeling evolution,
gene network dynamics, quantitative genetics, develop-
ment and population genetics.
- This position is ideal for those biologists with an inter-
est in theory and in the evolution of complex phenotypes.
This includes also students interested in evo-devo, quan-
titative genetics, population genetics and development.
- Although some computational methods will be used,
this position is for a biologist (or similar) No experience
in bioinformatics is required.
2. Introduction to the topic of research
How is it possible that complex structures like the hu-
man brain or the molecular machinery within cells have
evolved? Current evolutionary theory provides the basic
principles to understand such evolution but its theo-
retical core, population genetics, does not incorporate
models of how genes interact or on how they interact
with cell and tissue properties. This is a bit of a limita-
tion since, clearly, complex phenotypes are built through
complex networks of gene and cell interactions. Besides,
although mutation is random, the structure and dynam-
ics of these networks determine how phenotypes change
when there are mutations in some of their genes. In
other words, these networks determine the which pheno-
typic variation is possible and likely (i.e. the directions
of phenotypic variation). Current evolutionary biology
does not understand well which types and directions of
phenotypic variation arise in populations. Having such
understanding is crucial to understand the direction of
evolution since natural selection can only act on phe-
notypes that have arisen in each generation (i.e. the
possible directions of variation). Understanding how the
networks that construct the phenotype determine, to-
gether with natural selection, the direction of evolution
is one of the main current challenges in evolutionary
theory.- The research will be in any of these three related lines:
2.1. Models to predict evolution.
The networks determining possible phenotypic varia-
tion are complex. However, by understanding some
aspects of their dynamics, we can understand which
phenotypic variation they can produce. For example, by
computational models of gene networks during embry-
onic development we have obtained an understanding of
the directions of variation most likely to occur in specic
phenotypes (mammalian teeth, see Salazar-Ciudad and
Jernvall, 2010). In a way these models describe the
space of phenotypes within which a population would
evolve over time. If information about natural selection
is available, then these models can be used to predict
how phenotypes evolve. This is literally a prediction on
how traits in a phenotype (e.g. a wing shape) will change
over generations. Our research consists in building such
prediction approach in general and also applying it to
specic cases of evolution. By specic cases of evolution
we mean actual experimental evolution. We are doing
articial selection experiments in which we select ies
based on specic aspects of their wing morphology. We
also have a computational model of wing development
and we are adapting it into an evolutionary model with
which we try to predict how wing morphology evolved
in these experiments.
2.2 Evolutionary theory under complex genotype-
phenotype maps.
Most of evolutionary theory developed at a time when
not much was known about which directions or types
of phenotypic variation are possible from gene networks
and development nor about the genotype-phenotype
map. As a result, its main mathematical models and
concepts are based on the assumption that this latter
map is simple or by ignoring it all together. The aim in
here is to build general models of evolution that realisti-
cally consider the networks that construct the phenotype
and its variation. These models will then be used to
explore how, or whether, many of the ideas and con-
clusions of current evolutionary theory change (or not).
These models will also be used to address questions that
current evolutionary theory cannot explain, does not
aim to explain or that, simply, could be explained better
by considering gene networks and development, such as:
the evolution of development and gene networks, the
direction of evolution in the short and long term, how
evolution in complex adaptive landscapes is possible,
how complex phenotypes can evolve, etc.
2.3 Any other question of the applicant's interest that
is related to the previous questions.
3. Requirements:November 1, 2022 EvolDir 17
- Candidates should have a University Degree and a Mas-
ter's Degree in biology or related topics within the Eu-
ropean Higher Education System (minimum 300 ECTS)
or equivalent by September 2022.

PhD Position at the University of Guyana, Cayenne,
French Guyana in collaboration with Paris Saclay,
France and the Medical University of Vienna, Austria
We are searching for a highly motivated PhD student to
join an IRD-funded research project studying the role
of the microbiome in facilitating the successful spread of
invasive Drosophila species in natural populations of the
Amazonian rainforest. The PhD research project will
be tightly embedded and supervised in joint guardian-
ship between the University of Guyana and University
of Paris-Saclay by Mathieu Chouteau (LEEISA) and
Aur elie Hua-Van (EGCE), and will benet from the
co-supervision of Wolfgang Miller of the Medical Uni-
versity of Vienna. The PhD student will be mainly
based in French Guiana in the LEEISA laboratory, in
the EEBA team of Mathieu Chouteau, but may be re-
quired to spend time in the European laboratories in
Paris and Vienna which are tightly associated with the
project. He/she will have access to the CNRS cam-
pus of Montabo, Cayenne (DNA laboratory, equipment,
server), and will be able to use the vehicles of the site20 EvolDir November 1, 2022
for his/her collection missions. The successful candi-
date will be embedded in a collaborative research team
mainly at the University Guyana, South America, but
also at the University Paris Saclay, France, and the
Medical University of Vienna, Austria. She/he will need
to apply a multilevel experimental approach to address
the project's research goals.
Project Background and Signicance: The Amazon rain-
forest is one of the richest areas of the planet in terms
of biodiversity, but in great danger due to human activi-
ties, global warming, or the expansion of invasive species.
These invasive species compete with native species and
their success can be accompanied by the transmission
of the microbiome (bacteria, viruses) that they har-
bor. This microbiome, which may have a benecial role
(protection, speciation) in their usual hosts, may aect
the tness of new hosts at various scales (reproduction,
physiology, nutrition), thus massively weakening local
biodiversity and increasing the risk of extinction. While
the microbiome is well studied mainly in model species
in the laboratory, we have little information on its com-
plexity and dynamics in nature. Drosophila represent a
model of choice for the study of microbiome dynamics,
due to the promiscuity of species that share their feed-
ing and oviposition sites. In French Guiana, which is
mainly covered by primary rainforest, the high diversity
of endemic Drosophila species is endangered severely
by the regular arrival of potentially invasive challengers
from metropolitan France via human activity.
Thesis topic: This thesis is aimed to uncover the diver-
sity and dynamics of the microbiome in endemic and
invasive Drosophila species, and the risks of their re-
ciprocal transfer and trans-infection in (i) their natural
conditions (eld), (ii) semi-natural (eld cages), and (iii)
controlled laboratory conditions. In a rst step, the PhD
student will collect systematically Drosophila specimens
at dierent seasonal times and locations (reecting an
anthropic gradient). The collected species will be iden-
tied via COI barcoding, which will allow to describe
the diversity of this group of species. The microbiome
will be identied by DNA or RNA sequencing of spec-
imens grouped by species. This will allow to evaluate
the introgression rate of the microbiome from invasive
species. In a second step, the PhD student will set
up experimental evolution experiments in semi-natural
conditions (population cages) in order to measure the
relative tness of native and invasive species under dif-
ferent conditions and to specify the transfer rates of
the microbiome under controlled conditions. Finally,
the eect of microbiome deletion or exchange will be
tested in the laboratory on wild-derived isofemale lines
stripped of their natural microbiome and brought into
contact with the feces of other species.Your qualications: Applying candidates should have a
keen interest in eld as well as laboratory work using
the model system Drosophila, microbiology, genomics,
population genetics, plus a high degree of scientic cu-
riosity. An excellent background in molecular biology,
very good experimental skills and an MSc degree in
molecular life sciences, or a related eld are required as
well. Earlier experience in any of the mentioned eld
will be an added advantage. Good communication skills,
uently speaking French and English, independence,
and a high sense of responsibility are required. The suc-
cessful PhD candidate will be enrolled in the Doctoral
school program: ED 577 Structure and Dynamics of
Living Systems from the Universit e Paris-Saclay, and
ED of the University of Guyana in joint guardianship.
The salary will be de 2.765 euro monthly for 3 years.
The starting date is December 1st, 2022.

LMU Munich AvianCompetition
Social competition within- and among-species: drivers
of pace-of-life in wild passerine birds? PhD-position in
Behavioral Ecology at LMU Munich
Application deadline: 15.11.2022
Project description. The eld of behavioural ecology
increasingly focuses on why individual animals dier
in suites of behavioural and morphological traits, and
whether those dierences are associated with life-history
variation. A key question is whether life-history trade-
os explain the evolutionary maintenance of this varia-
tion in \pace-of-life syndromes". There is much debate
on this issue because life-history trade-os cannot by
themselves maintain variation. This project will test pre-
dictions of a novel eco-evolutionary explanation that has
great potential to resolve this debate. The framework
explains variation among species, populations, and indi-
viduals alike. We propose that variation in pace-of-life
results from trade-os between intrinsic rate of density-
independent reproduction and competitive ability. This
incorporates ecological variation required to maintain
variation as faster (vs. slower) paces-of-life are favoured
when competition for resources is relaxed (vs. intensi-
ed). We will test this idea by combining behavioural
ecology and quantitative genetics, and by using experi-
mental and population comparative approaches.
The PhD-student will (1) manipulate intra- and inter-
specic competitive regimes as drivers of selection on
pace-of-life syndromes within and among sympatric nest
box populations of blue and great tits. (2) Use DNA
metabarcoding of faecal samples to estimate relative
abundances of arthropods in the tits' diet to study
whether habitat selection and dietary specialisation
mediate pace-of-life-related adaptations to intra- and
interspecic competitive regimes. (3) Study whether
competition-related selection on pace-of-life can explain
variation in behaviour, morphology, and life history
among and within species.Research and Project group. The PhD-student will work
in the Behavioural Ecology Group at LMU. The group
works broadly on individual behaviour and life-history,
and consists of 5 PhD-students and 3 postdocs, oer-
ing a dynamic social environment. The PhD-student
will collaborate closely with the project's postdoc (Dr.
Barbara Class), who will focus on social selection and
indirect genetic eects analyses of long-term pedigreed
datasets of >40 European tit populations with members
of SPI-Birds as part of this project. The PhD-student
will collaborate with Prof. Kees van Oers (NIOO, Wa-
geningen) and Prof. Both (University of Groningen)
on metabarcoding, with Dr. Culina (Ruder Boskovic
Institute), Prof. Visser (NIOO) and SPI-Birds members
on collaborative SPI-Birds projects, and with various
other international partners.
Requirements. The successful candidate should have
background training in quantitative genetics, evolution-
ary biology, and/or behavioural ecology. We are looking
for candidates that have experience with eldwork, bird
handling, are able to work independently, and coordinate
large teams. The candidate should be trained/interested

LMU Munich AvianEpigenetics
PhD Position in Evolutionary Epigenetics
A PhD position investigating the relevance of epigenetic
variation in natural populations to evolution is available
in the research group of Jochen Wolf at Munich Uni-
versity, Germany This project is part of a collaborative22 EvolDir November 1, 2022
eort involving several avian research groups in Europe.
Background
Since the merger of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian
hereditary principles at the onset of the 20th century,
genetic variation has been at the core of evolutionary
research. Genome-wide scrutiny of genetic variation
segregating in natural populations has provided funda-
mental insights into the evolutionary processes under-
lying adaptation and speciation. Yet, calls for incorpo-
rating epigenetic modications of the DNA blueprint
into an extended evolutionary synthesis have repeatedly
been made. And indeed, epigenetic variation consti-
tutes an important modier of phenotypic variation and
may promote plastic responses allowing populations to
explore novel niche space. Evolutionary relevance of
epigenetic modication, however, will depend on the re-
lationship between environmental inducibility and trans-
generational stability independent of the underlying
genetic variation. Comprehensive data on both of these
aspects are scarce.
The Project
The research program proposes to ll this knowledge
gap using a broad geographic sampling regime of several
thousand individuals from pedigree-informed natural
populations of two avian species as a model: the great
tit, Parus major, and the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus.
The experimental setup is suited to characterize the
intrinsic and external forces shaping diversity in 5mC
DNA methylation across various scales of integration.
WBGS and RRBS data extracted from all individu-
als allows quantifying the inheritance patterns of these
epigenetic marks within families (broods) leveraging
additional power from extra pair young. It is also suited
to determine the extent of population-level epigenetic
variability across diverse environments. In addition,
evolutionary rates of epigenetic proles can be assessed
across larger evolutionary timescales by comparison to
5mC datasets of more distantly related avian species.
Qualications The successful applicant holds a mas-
ter degree in a relevant subject and is skilled in bioin-
formatic analyses with large genome-wide data sets.
Previous experience with epigenetic work, quantitative
genetics and/or statistical modelling (e.g. linear mixed
models) is a clear asset.
Research environment of the host lab The Wolf lab
applies an integrative approach to explore micro-
evolutionary processes and genetic mechanisms under-
lying species divergence, adaptation and genome evo-
lution (1, 2). Using large-scale genomic approaches
combined with eld based experiments, we characterize
genetic diversity within and between populations andassess its relationship to phenotypic divergence (3-6) -
sometimes interpreting the data under a conservation
angle (7, 8). In addition, we explore methodological
aspects of data analyses (9, 10) and investigate the
evolutionary forces shaping genomes (11, 12). Empiri-
cal systems currently include birds (swallows, cuckoos
and corvids (4-6, 13, 14)), marine mammals (pinnipeds
and killer whales) (8, 15) and ssion yeast (16, 17).
More information on the research activities in the lab
can be found at http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/-

sistently ranked among the top Universities worldwide,
in particular the life science branch with its life sci-
ence campus oering excellent technical facilities and
many interaction possibilities including the Gene Cen-
tre, several Max-Planck-Institutes and the Helmholtz
Centre (http://www.campusmartinsried.de/en/336-2/-
#). With the highest concentration of supercomputing
in Germany the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre and
its local partners provide access to state-of-the art com-
puting facilities (https://www.lrz.de/english/). Munich,
Bavaria's capital, is a vibrant, yet relaxed city with
many traditions still alive, a high quality of living and
the Alps nearby.
How to apply Applications including a CV, a state-
ment of motivation and the contact details of at least
two references in a single .pdf should be sent to evolu-
tion@bio.lmu.de with subject header 'epigenetic posi-
tion'. The position remains open until lled, starting

>From humid tropics into the arid zones: phylogenomic-
sof Amaranthaceaesensu stricto(Caryophyllales)
The Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae alliance comprises
twomorphologically and physiologically variable clades
that arose through ancient,rapid diversication. Al-
thoughAmaranthaceae and Chenopodiaceae are nowrec-
ognized as a single plant family (Amaranthaceae s.l.),
there is a starkcontrast between these two taxa. Amaran-
thaceaes.s.has its highestspecies diversity in the tropics
andsubtropics, underwent at least three polyploidiza-
tion events, and has markedly fewerC4species than
Chenopodiaceaes.s.In contrast,Chenopodiaceaes.s.is rich
in C4species that radiated rapidly in semi-arid, arid
and saline habitats worldwide,and did not undergo any
signicant polyploidization events. The evolutionary-
history ofChenopodiaceaes.s.hasbeen thoroughly inves-
tigated in recent years, but evolutionary studies inAma-
ranthaceaes.s.are less complete. This uneven situation
precludescomparativestudies of these two major taxa
within Amaranthaceaes.l.that could yield key insights
into theevolution of their clear physiological and ecolog-
ical dierentiation.
The successful applicant will perform a phylogenomic-
study using a target enrichment sequencing approach
with a custom bait setdeveloped in the Kadereit lab,
and apply it on arepresentative sample of Amaran-
thaceaes.s.taxa. The aimsof this project aremani-
fold, and include: a) placing the evolutionary history
of Amaranthaceaes.s.into time and space; b) recon-
structing tropical-xeric biome transitions and anyas-
sociated morphological and/or physiological characters,
and c) comparing the evolutionary history of Amaran-
thaceaes.s.with that of former Chenopodiaceae, espe-
cially with respect to C4photosynthesis evolution.

LateralGeneTransferInPlants
The Dunning lab is recruiting a fully funded PhD stu-
dent to investigate the mechanics of lateral gene transfer
in plants.
Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a widespread phe-
nomenon in grasses that has moved functional genes
across the family into domesticated and wild species
alike. Key crops such as maize, wheat and rice have
dozens of lateral acquired genes in their genomes, but
how they got there and the eect they have is unknown.
The student will investigate the mechanics of LGT in key
crops using a combination of cutting edge experimental,
genetic and computational approaches.
The three main fundamental evolutionary questions are:
[1] How is this foreign DNA inserted into the genome
of the recipient? Are the genes randomly inserted into
the genome, or are there specic target sites that might
hint at the mechanisms behind the transfers[2] How are the transferred genes actually used by the re-
cipient plant? Just because you have the recipe doesn't
necessarily mean you know how to express it.
[3] Do LGTs in crops play a role in environmental adap-
tation or certain agronomic traits?
The outcomes of this project have the potential to alter
our understanding of how plants can rapidly adapt to
environmental change through trading genetic secrets,
with potential impacts on future crop generation and

Dear colleagues,
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD-student to
join the long-term research on the ecology and evolution
of interactions between plants, insects & microbes, with
a focus on the food web surrounding oak trees.
For more information see the project description (below)
and the following link:

and don't hesitate to contact me directly by email, (clos-
ing date is November 4)
My best,
Ayco Tack
ayco.tack@su.se
Some more info: Questions that the project aims to an-
swer are: Where do the microorganisms associated with
plants come from? Are they inherited from the mother
plant through the seeds, or are they acquired from the
environment? How will plant-associated microorganisms
aect the assembly of the insect community? What are
the drivers that structure plant-associated multitrophic
food webs, and do the structuring forces dier between
microorganisms and macroorganisms?
To answer these questions, we have to link studies onthe micro- and macrobiome across spatial and temporal
scales. One useful approach is to focus on a diverse
community associated with a keystone species. In this
project we will use the pedunculate oak Quercus robur.
The PhD-student will be located at DEEP with Ayco
Tack as main supervisor, but with complementary sup-
port by a group of co-supervisors with other compe-
tences.

The Delmore Lab at the University of Texas A&M is
looking for a PhD student to join our group in Sept
2023.
We study speciation using hybrid zones and work at
both the micro and macroevolutionary scale.
One of our research stream focuses on behaviour - how
variation in behavioural traits contributes to speciation
and the genetic basis of these traits. Two of the be-
haviors we study are seasonal migration and courtship
behavior in thrushes and hummingbirds, respectively.
Another research stream takes a more comparative ap-
proach, focusing on processes that generate genome-wide
variation in estimates of dierentiation during speciation.
We use both genomic data and computer simulations to
address this question.
Students can pursue degrees in Biology (https://-
www.bio.tamu.edu/), EEB (https://www.eeb.tamu.edu)
or Genetics (https://www.genetics.tamu.edu). All of
these programs have collaborative, enthusiastic and sup-
portive environment. They include students from many
dierent international backgrounds and you will be able
to develop knowledge in evolution and substantial ge-nomic and computational skills while you're here.

UAuckland NZ WineMicroEvol
PhD Opportunity at the University of Auckland,
New Zealand in collaboration with Lincoln University,
Christchurch and Bragato Research Institute, Blenheim.
Microbial community and vine responses to climate
change and potential consequences for NZ wine styles
We are seeking an enthusiastic and highly motivated
PhD student with interests in both the fundamental
and applied aspects of microbial community ecology
and population biology to join our group. Funding has
been obtained to support a PhD stipend and fees to
investigate the impact of increasing temperatures as a
result of climate change on microbial communities asso-
ciated with vines and wines and potential implications
for regional wine styles. The student will be based at
the School of Biological Sciences at the University of
Auckland (under the supervision of Dr Sarah Knight,
co-supervisor AP Gavin Lear) and work in collaboration
with Lincoln University in Christchurch (co-supervisor
Dr Amber Parker) and the New Zealand Winegrowers
Bragato Research Institute in Blenheim.
Microbial communities play a core role in the quality of
agricultural products with measurable eects on nutri-
ent availability, and plant disease resilience. The wine
industry is particularly dependent on the role micro-
bial communities play during fermentation, transforming
grapes to wine, and how they contribute to the quality of
wine produced. Previous research has shown microbial
communities correlate with wine chemical properties. In
combination with microbial community dierentiation
by geographic region there is now compelling evidence of
a microbial aspect to wine regionality, or terroir. There
have been a few studies looking into the direct or in-
direct impact of temperature on microbial community
composition for grape and wine production with little
knowledge on how climate change will aect microbialNovember 1, 2022 EvolDir 31
communities of signicance for wine style. We predict
that changes in temperature will in turn change the
composition of microbial communities in New Zealand's
vineyards and are interested in the interaction with vine
physiology and the eects on wine characteristics. By
understanding changes in microbial communities and
plant phenotypes in response to climate change, the
New Zealand Wine Industry will be better prepared to
implement strategies to adapt to potential unwanted
changes to their regional wine styles because of it.
A combination of eld and laboratory-based experiments
will be devised to evaluate aspects of microbial commu-
nity ecology and population biology to understand how
temperature shapes microbial communities associated
with vines and winemaking, and how these dierences
might aect wine chemical composition. Such a project
will produce quality academic outputs and valuable in-
formation for growers and winemakers regarding the
potential eects of climate change on vineyard ecosys-
tems and the quality of the wine deriving from these
changes. The student will be expected to liaise with
industry contacts and design and implement vineyard
trials to test robust experimental hypotheses. Micro-
biology and molecular biology techniques, including
next-generation DNA sequencing will be used to analyse
microbial communities and populations. Hypotheses
of interest will be tested using community ecology and
population genetic analyses. The student will also be
expected to measure and evaluate changes in grapevine
physiology in response to modied temperature condi-
tions, and investigate potential relationships to changes
in microbial communities. A strong background in ecol-
ogy and molecular genetic approaches is recommended,
along with some experience in microbiology and a basic
knowledge of plant biology. The student needs to be
prepared to spend time in the eld and in the laboratory.
This project includes the cost of fees and a tax-

necessary, applicants eligible for a prestigious https:/-

GullSpeciationGenomics
4-year PhD position \Unraveling the genomic origin of
species in the large white-headed gull radiation"
A PhD position for four years (100%) is available at the
Natural History Museum Basel and the Department of
Environmental Science, University of Basel, Switzerland.
Our project investigates the genomic basis of specia-
tion in one of the fastest diversifying bird lineages, the
Holarctic radiation of large white-headed gulls (Larus
spp.) that produced 16 species and 35 subspecies in less
than a million years. The PhD student will have the
opportunity to investigate the genomic architecture of
reproductive isolation across the speciation continuum
and to reconstruct how the entire radiation of large
white-headed gulls unfolded. We will investigate the
speciation continuum using natural variation in the spe-
ciation process (Stankowski & Ravinet 2021) present in
this fantastic bird system, by comparing whole genome
population genomic data of several species with varying
degrees of divergence, geographic overlap and reproduc-
tive isolation, including transects across two independent
hybrid zones (Gay et al. 2009). We will further use
whole genomes of all known taxa to reconstruct the
origin, route, timing and the role of gene ow in this
rapid bird radiation (Marques et al. 2019a, b). The
position will involve eld, lab and museum-based work
and genomic data analysis using population genomic
and phylogenomic approaches. A Postdoc in our team
will simultaneously generate state-of-the-art genomic
resources in collaboration with the Wellcome Sanger
Institute, Cambridge, UK.
This project is a collaboration between David Mar-
ques (principal investigator, Natural History Museum
Basel, Switzerland), Walter Salzburger (University of
Basel, Switzerland), Joana Meier (Wellcome Sanger In-
stitute, UK), Pierre-Andr e Crochet (CNRS Montpellier,
France), Manuel Schweizer (Natural History Museum
Bern, Switzerland) and Magdalena Zagalska-Neubauer
(University of Wroc ^A3aw, Poland). The PhD position
will be supervised by David Marques at the Natural
History Museum Basel and associated with the group of32 EvolDir November 1, 2022
Walter Salzburger at the University of Basel, Switzer-
land.
I am looking for a highly motivated person eager to ad-
dress big questions in evolutionary biology with whole
genome data. In particular, I seek candidates with a
strong foundation in evolutionary biology and interest in
speciation, genomics and evolution in general, preferably
(but not necessarily) with some experience in program-
ming and genomic data analysis. Candidates for this
position are required to hold a Masters degree in Biology
or Bioinformatics from a higher education institution
recognized by the University of Basel. In my mission to
build a diverse, inclusive and highly collaborative lab, I
am looking for a kind person that is both eager to work
independently and to actively contribute to an interac-
tive and supportive team and therein to a positive lab
environment.
Both the Natural History Museum and the University
of Basel harbor a friendly and welcoming community
of MSc, PhD and Postdoc researchers and are located
within 10 minutes walking distance from each other in
the heart of Basel city. Basel is the third largest city
of Switzerland, bordering France and Germany, is rich
in historical buildings and with lively traditions, has a
cosmopolitan ambience and a world-renowned art and
museum scene. Strong public transport in the city and
Switzerland allowing for easy train access to the Jura
mountains and the Swiss alps add to the experience,
letting Basel rank among the global top 10 cities for
quality of living.
The position is available from between January and
April 2023, the application deadline is November 30,
2022. The PhD salary will be according to Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation standards (approx. CHF
47,000-50,000 annually before taxes for four years of
100% employment).
Please send an application letter (outlining your mo-
tivation and what your skills will add to this project),
CV and contact information of two references to
David Marques (david.marques@bs.ch) until the dead-
line on November 30, 2022. For any inquiries re-
garding the position, please contact David Marques

Graduate Positions in Sexual Selection/Parasite-Host
Biology
The Polak Lab at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio,
USA, is recruiting graduate students to work in the
areas of sexual selection and host-parasite evolutionary
ecology, and to join a growing research team pursuing
these themes. The questions students would pursue are
exible within the broader scope of these disciplines.
Our main systems involve ectoparasitic mites and par-
asitoids of insect hosts. The mites are sexually trans-
missible and there is exciting potential to explore both
pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection mediated by
these parasites; both \good genes" and direct tness
models apply. Students will be able to develop skills
that are strongly multi-disciplinary, involving study of
natural host-parasite systems, behavioral ecology, insect
mating systems, reproductive physiology, quantitative
genetics, bioinformatics and functional genomics. Suc-
cessful applicants will be highly motivated to pursue
graduate research in the above theoretical areas, and
eager to develop their creativity and science competency.

UEdinburgh FrogSpeciation
Inferring the role of sexual and natural selection in spe-
ciation through genomics of colouration in strawberry
poison frogs
Funding Status: Funding is in competition with other
projects and students through Doctoral Training Pro-
grams (NERC and BBSRC DTPs)
Project Description Animal populations that use dif-
ferent adaptive strategies are an ideal study system to
uncover processes involved in early stages of speciation.
The aim of this study is to understand the interplay
of natural and sexual selection in generating biological
diversity by using strawberry poison frogs as a study
system. Theses amphibians are widely distributed in
the Bocas del Toro archipelago in Panama and show a
remarkable colour polymorphism, with up to 18 dier-
ent colour morphs occurring in sympatry and allopatry.
To avoid predation, the frogs adapt one of two strate-
gies: aposematism (conspicuous warning colouration) or
crypsis (inconspicuous colouration that blends in with
surroundings). Because strawberry poison frog morphs36 EvolDir November 1, 2022
mate assortatively, dierences in coloration driven by
natural selection (the predator avoidance strategy) may
interact with sexual selection (preference for morphs
of the same colour as oneself) and promote population
dierentiation. Thus, this study system oers a unique
opportunity to investigate evolutionary forces that are
at play in the early stages of speciation.
This project will make use of genomic and transcriptomic
data to study demography, population dierentiation,
and the genomic basis of colouration in multiple cryptic
and aposematic strawberry poison frog populations. Re-
search questions include: - What is the genomic basis of
crypsis and aposematism? Is colouration determined by
a few loci or does it require changes in many genes? The
genomics of colouration will determine the complexity of
switching between predator avoidance strategies. - What
are the underlying changes in gene expression involved
in generating colour polymorphism within the dierent
strategies? How is the colour perceived and processed? -
Does population history/demography play a role in the
predator avoidance strategy? Previous studies suggest
that the variation in colouration among populations
have occurred through repeated loss of aposematism.
Could this loss be associated with population bottle-
necks? Drift (particularly if colouration is based on few
loci) or negative selection in small populations where ed-
ucating predators is not successful, could be the driving
forces.
Methodology The project relies on a comprehensive
transcriptomic dataset of several frog tissues and shot-
gun DNA data generated from muscle. This is pri-
marily a computational project that will use publicly
available and newly generated genomic resources to
study population dierentiation, population history,
and gene expression. It will be conducted in collab-
oration with researchers in the UK, Sweden, Germany
and the United States of America. The project will be
jointly supervised by Katerina Guschanski (University
of Edinburgh), Anna Qvarnstr om (Uppsala University),
Carolina Segami (Duke University) and Simon Martin
(University of Edinburgh).
Candidate requirements To be eligible for a PhD-student
position the applicant should have at least an upper
2.1 degree in evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, or
a related eld. In the British system, candidates who
have successfully nished their undergraduate degree
(Honours) are eligible to apply. The technical skills of
the candidates will be evaluated based on the experience
with large-scale sequencing analyses and bioinformatics
prociency. Experience with transcriptomics will be
an advantage. The ideal candidate will have a strong
interest and documented knowledge in evolutionary bi-
ology, with a drive to understand processes involved inspeciation. Perseverance and high intrinsic motivation
are necessary to successfully complete a PhD project
and overcome the unavoidable obstacles with data and
analyses. You will be highly reliable, driven and well-
organised, curious and willing to think outside the box,
with the ability to quickly acquire new skills, and a
person who enjoys working both independently and as
part of a team.
The position will begin Fall 2023. Interested
students should send a current CV and a brief
letter of interest to Dr. Katerina Guschan-
ski (Katerina.Guschanski@ed.ac.uk) and get
in contact for more details. More information

UFlorida EvolutionaryPhysiology
Dan Hahn's Lab is looking to recruit a new PhD student
to work in the areas of evolution of phenotypic plastic-
ity, mechanisms of plasticity, and climate change in fall
2023. The student will be encouraged to work broadly
in one of four overlapping areas: 1) testing predictions
from theoretical evolutionary ecology models about the
roles of spatial and temporal variation in the evolu-
tion of seasonal thermal plasticity and/or dormancy
phenotypes using insects as models, 2) identifying the
underlying genetic and physiological architectures of
plasticity in thermal and dormancy traits in insects,
3) testing hypotheses about how insects may use chro-
matin modication to mediate plasticity responses both
within and between generations, and 4) testing the ex-
tent to which plastic responses can induce greater male
competitiveness in sexual selection.

A PhD position for three years (100%) is available at
University of Iceland, Reykjavik Iceland.
University of Iceland seeks a highly ecient and moti-
vated candidate for a new and exciting project. The
project is funded for three years by RANNIS (The Ice-
landic Centre for Research) Technology Development
Fund.Background: Roseroot (Rhodiola rosea) is in high
global demand in the natural medicine industry where
it is marketed as an antidepressant and for relieving
stress and fatigue. It is also used for hair products and
cosmetics. Collection has depleted wild populations andNovember 1, 2022 EvolDir 39
roseroot is now red listed in several countries. In this
project, partners with dierent expertise unite to nd an
optimal way to sustainably cultivate roseroot in Iceland
for marketing as a high-quality product.
Field of work
The project: Roseroots from three habitats (lowland
clis, highland tundra and mountain tops) will be com-
pared with respect to ecological characteristics, genetic
diversity, active compounds, rhizome biomass and seed
quality. Transplanted individuals will be cultivated in
experimental plots and after two growing seasons, scored
for growth rate, biomass allocation and active rhizome
compounds. We will then select the best population
and compare options on product preparation for sale to
food supplement, herbal medicine and cosmetic markets.
One product will be a guide to the cultivation of rose-
root in Iceland. We hope that the project may make
the sustainable cultivation and sale of roseroot products
an attractive sideline for traditional farmers in Iceland.
The project includes partners from dierent arenas. Par-
ticipants from the University of Iceland come from the
Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences and the
Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The farming part-
ners will be responsible for cultivation and experimental
plots. The nal partner is a company on the cosmetics
market.
The Ph.D. project addresses three aspects: 1) the ecol-
ogy of the three wild populations 2) their genetic di-
versity and divergence 3) The Ph.D. candidate will be
responsible for the assessment of the performance of the
transplanted individuals after 2 years cultivation. Two
professors in biology will be responsible for the ecologi-
cal and genetic parts of the project and will supervise
the Ph.D. candidate.
Qualication requirements
* M.Sc. degree in Biology, Ecology or Molecular Biology
* Valuable experience of statistical analyses and bioinfor-
matics or population genetics * Excellent English, both
written and spoken * Good planning and organization
skills * Ability to work both independently and in a
team
The selected candidate must send a formal application
for PhD studentship at the University of Iceland within
one month after being oered the position.
Application process
The PhD student position starts in April 2023.
Applications should include: i) a cover letter stating
the candidate`s research interests and experiences in the
eld of the project, ii) a CV, iii) copies of university
diplomas (BS and MS), iv) names and full contact in-formation of two professional referees (including their
relationship to the applicant).

EvolAdaptiveMaternalEects
The neuro- and epigenetic mechanisms of adaptive ma-
ternal eects in Drosophila melanogaster The Kohlmeier
lab at the Department of Biological Sciences, University
of Memphis, TN is recruiting a bright and motivated
PhD student to start 08/15/2023 to unravel the neuroge-
netic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate adaptive
maternal eects and to identify the evolutionary drivers
that facilitated their evolution.
Background: Temperature is an important regulator
of biochemical and biological processes. Thus, uctu-
ations in temperature can select for mechanisms that
enable females to anticipate future temperatures and
to adapt their ospring to the predicted environment.
While the adaptive values of such anticipatory maternal
eects have been suggested theoretically and recently
been demonstrated empirically, the molecular and cel-
lular mechanisms via which females monitor tempera-
ture and induce transgenerational adaptations and how
these adaptations modulate ospring gene expression
and physiology is poorly understood. Preliminary data
produced by our lab suggest that signaling of tempera-
ture sensing cells modulates the ovarian epigenome and
by that, inuences the maternal mRNA populations
deposited into the developing oocyte.
The project: The goal of this project is (i) to identify
the mechanisms via which temperature sensing modies
the ovarian epigenome and maternal mRNA popula-
tions, (ii) to reveal how maternal mRNA populations
deposited into the egg dier in response to dierent
temperatures, (iii) to dissect how those maternal mR-
NAs inuence ospring temperature adaptation, and
(iv) to understand how these mechanisms could have
evolved. For this, we will integrate the neurogenetic
toolkit exclusively available in Drosophila melanogaster
with opto-/thermogenetic manipulations of individual
neurons, RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics, transgenet-
ics, standardized high throughput physiological and
behavioral experiments developed in our lab to quan-
tify temperature adaptation, analytic chemistry, and
uorescent microscopy.
Requirements: For this project, I am seeking a bright
and motivated student with a passion for interdisci-
plinary work that integrates mechanistic and evolution-
ary approaches to understand the evolution of adaptivetraits. Besides an organizational talent to handle ies of
multiple genotypes in parallel, the ideal candidate has
experience in performing behavioral experiments, molec-
ular genetics, and statistics. Skills in bioinformatics (R,
bash) or a high motivation to acquire these skills are
essential. Experience in handling fruit ies is benecial
but not required.
About the city and the department: Memphis is a cultur-
ally rich city famous for its music, food and its historic
importance. Situated at the Mississippi river and in close
proximity to several State parks, Memphis combines city
life with close-by natural habitats for recreation. The
University of Memphis is a leading metropolitan research
institution with over 30 faculty members specializing

Application Deadline: October 27, 2022
A PhD student position is available in the newly-
established laboratory of Professor Vaishali Katju in
the Evolutionary Biology program at the Department
of Ecology and Genetics, Uppsala University (Sweden).
Project description We are seeking a Ph.D. student
interested in combining the power of experimental evo-
lution using Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic and
high-throughput genomic approaches to investigate fun-
damental questions in evolution. Our research program
is diverse and includes multiple ongoing projects inves-
tigating (but not restricted to) (i) the tness eects
and evolutionary dynamics of spontaneous mutations,
especially copy-number variants, (ii) the tness conse-
quences of selsh mitochondria and the genetic basis
of mitonuclear adaptation, (iii) genomic conict and
compensatory evolution, and (iv) the genetic basis of
adaptation following tness decline and recovery. The
successful candidate will be involved in analyzing both
whole-genome sequence and transcriptome datasets of
experimentally evolved C. elegans populations but will
also have opportunities to design and initiate novel
projects of choice that fall within the umbrella theme
of our expertise.
Duties The position will both involve both wet-lab and
computational components. The wet-lab component
will involve experimental evolution projects with C. el-
egans and standard molecular procedures (DNA and
RNA extraction, PCR, sequencing, gel electrophoresis,
genomic library preparation, among others). Addition-
ally, there is scope for incorporating genome editing
using CRISPR/Cas9 approaches and employing stan-
dard genetic backcrossing techniques. All projects are
expected to involve a strong bioinformatic component in-
volving analyses of DNA-Seq and/or RNA-Seq datasets.
Training will be provided when necessary.
Qualications required To be eligible for a PhD-student
position the applicant must hold a Master's degree in
evolutionary biology and well-versed with fundamental
principles/theory of population genetics, quantitativegenetics, and molecular evolution. Applicants lacking
a Master's degree in evolutionary biology will not be
given further consideration. Great emphasis is placed on
personal qualities such as planning and organizational
skills, strong motivation and ability to problem-solve,
strong interpersonal communication skills and an ability
to work collectively with other group members while fos-
tering a collaborative work atmosphere. The candidate
must possess documented experience and prociency in
both spoken as well as written English.
Qualications desired Candidates having experience
with experimental evolution, C. elegans husbandry,
molecular biology and bioinformatic/statistical analyses

Evolution and genomics of exaggerated sexual orna-
ments
Deadline for applying: Jan 13th 2023 Lead supervi-
sor: Dr Alison Wright (University of Sheeld) Co-
supervisors: Prof Jon Slate (University of Sheeld),
Prof Steve Paterson (University of Liverpool), Prof An-
drew Pomiankowski (UCL)
The Project Sexual selection is a powerful agent of evo-
lution, responsible for some of the most striking traits
in the animal kingdom. Many of these sexual traits
are highly exaggerated, particularly in males, and are
thought to have evolved as honest signals of male qual-
ity in response to female preference. Establishing how
these traits and preferences arise is vital to understand-
ing how and why the diversity of life is established and
maintained.
This project will study the evolution and genomics of
exaggerated male ornaments and female preference us-
ing new single-cell sequencing data and stalk-eyed ies
as a model system. Stalk-eyed ies are a classic model
of sexual selection as they exhibit highly-exaggerated
eye-stalks, with males often having an eye span greater
than their body length. The specic questions and ap-
proaches taken can be tailored to the particular interests
of the student.
This work would suit a highly motivated student with
strong analytical skills and an enthusiasm for evolution
and genomics. Prior experience with bioinformatics is
welcomed but certainly not required. The project will
involve computational and laboratory work, and the
successful candidate will receive high quality training in
computational programming, wet-lab skills and insect
husbandry. Additionally, there will be ample oppor-
tunity for the student to develop their own research
interests over the course of the project.

SexualTraitsEnvironChange
Understanding the links between animal sexual traits
and environmental change
Overview:
The Cooney lab is seeking a motivated and enthusiastic
PhD student to study the links between animal sexual
traits and environmental change.
Deadline for applying: 13 Jan 2023 Start date: 01 Oct
2023 Lead supervisor: Dr Chris Cooney (University
of Sheeld) Co-supervisors: Dr Liam Dougherty (Uni-
versity of Liverpool), Dr Gavin Thomas (University of
Sheeld), Prof David Edwards (University of Sheeld)
The project:
Humans have brought unprecedented changes to envi-
ronments worldwide. A major priority for conservation
is to understand how organisms will respond to envi-
ronmental change, both in terms of the vulnerability of
species to extinction and how populations may evolve
when faced with novel pressures.
Species' traits have long been at the forefront of eorts
to understand population responses to environmental
change, with existing research focusing on the impor-
tance of biogeographic and ecological factors. However,
a key outstanding goal is to understand the interactions
between environmental change and species' sexual char-acteristics. There are good reasons to expect that traits
related to mate choice, sexual signalling, and repro-
duction may aect species' vulnerability to extinction
and/or their evolutionary responses to novel environ-
mental conditions.
The aim of this PhD is to understand the relationships
between animal sexual traits and environmental change,
and to shed light on the factors inuencing extinction
risk and the contemporary evolution of species' sexual
traits.
Specic objectives include: (1) assessing the importance
of sexual traits for determining extinction risk; (2) in-
vestigating whether and how environmental change is
driving contemporary evolution of sexual traits; (3) in-
vestigating the consequences of environmental change for
the future of animal sexual trait diversity in the Anthro-
pocene. The project will make use of large unpublished
datasets of avian sexual traits, including high-quality
measurements of plumage colouration and song: two
traits that act as important sexual signals for mates and
rivals in birds.
We welcome applications from candidates with broad
interests in ecology, conservation and evolution to tackle
this novel and exciting opportunity. Training will be
provided in specic analysis techniques and the success-
ful applicant will acquire advanced computational and
communication skills that are highly transferable. There
will be ample opportunity for the successful applicant
to develop specic research questions over the course of
the project.
The team:
The PhD student will be embedded within Dr Chris
Cooney's lab (www.cooneylab.co.uk) in the School of
Biosciences at the University of Sheeld. All super-
visors are currently working on research projects that
directly complement this studentship, providing an ex-
cellent research environment. The student can expect
to work closely with supervisors and their respective
collaborators around the world.

UTasmania Two sedaDNA
Please see below the advertisement for two PhD posi-

sedaDNA at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic
Studies (IMAS), University ofTasmania, Australia. The
positions are open to Australian and international ap-
plicants, with a scholarship application deadline on the
10th of October 2022. Applicants who are interested
but may not make the application deadline are encour-
aged to contact Linda before the 10th of October to
discuss interest in and application for either position
(linda.armbrecht@utas.edu.au).
Southern Ocean sedaDNA The inuence of palaeo-
climatic changes on Southern Ocean biodiversity
Comparative palaeoecological studies are a valuable
source of long-term data on biodiversity responses
to environmental change that can provide impor-
tant insights into future climate change responses.
Palaeoecological studies of marine taxa have been
challenging, however, with recent technological advances
in sedimentary ancient DNA research (sedaDNA), such
studies can now be realised. This computationally
focused project will utilise genetic sequence data
extracted from sediment cores collected at various
sites in the Southern Ocean. These sedaDNA datasets
were generated using metagenomic shotgun and/or
RNA based hybridisation-capture techniques to capture
degraded and fragmented sequences. The project will
focus on (1) developing bioinformatic approaches for
analysing and validating metagenomic sedaDNA, and
(2) reconstructing millennia-scale records of biodiversitypresence at key sites in the Southern Ocean and placing
these into context with palaeoclimatic records to
identify key environmental drivers associated with shifts
in biodiversity. This research will provide new insight
into the past eects of climate change on biodiversity
in the Southern Ocean, and will result in advances in
bioinformatic approaches for ancient DNA analyses.

Probing ancient Antarctic krill populations Antarctic
krill are vastly abundant crustaceans in the Southern
Ocean, where they are a critical ecosystem compo-
nent linking plankton to predators and contributing
to biogeochemical cycles. Climate change, and in
particular, winter sea-ice habitat reduction and ocean
acidication, as well as an increasing krill shery, could
lead to a population decline of this keystone species.
To assess the potentialimpacts on krill population
sustainability and resilience, studies investigating past
records of environmentally driven krill population
dynamics are crucial. To date, such paleo-studies
targeting krill have been impossible as krill leave no
fossil record for microscopic investigation, however, with
recent technological advances in sedimentary ancient
DNA research (sedaDNA), such studies can now be
realised. In fact, the application of sedaDNA analyses
to reconstruct Antarctic marine ecosystems has already
been shown, including the possibility to extract ancient
DNA from crustaceans. Thisresearch will build on
these already existing sedaDNA techniques and target
Antarctic krill specically. The latter will be achieved
by applying an RNA based hybridisation-capture
technique, a method that has been commonly used
in ancient DNA research to capture very degraded
and fragmented sequences. The capture approach
will target krill for the rst time, to investigate their
dynamics over thousands of years. This research will
ll an important gap in our understanding of how
Antarctic krill responded to past environmental change
- knowledge that will improve predictions about future
adaptation to ongoing climate change. Supervisors: Dr

UTennessee Knoxville
FunctionalMolEvol
The Gilchrist lab in the Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at the University of Ten-
nessee Knoxville (UTK) is recruiting M.S. and Ph.D.
level graduate students interested in studying functional
molecular evolution and genomics.
The lab's primariy focus is on building, tting, and re-
ning mechanistic models of translation in order to (a)
better understand the evolution of codon usage at the
gene and genomic levels and (b) improve interpretation
of publically available empirical datasets of gene expres-
sion (RNAseq, RibosomeSeq, etc). The lab's secondary
focus is in the area of phylogenetics. Specically, func-
tional phylogenetics where models of protein function
and expression are integrated into models of protein se-
quence evolution and models of Ultraconserved Element
(UCE) evolution where selection varies with position
inside a UCE.
The ideal student would have a strong interest and expe-
rience in one or more of the following areas: computer
programming and software development, statistical in-
ference, mathematical modeling, population genetics,
and molecular evolution. Students need not have math-
ematical training beyond calculus, but an anity for
mathematics is a must.
The EEB department at the UTK is ranks amongst the
best in the country. In particular, it is known for its
dynamic and collaborative graduate program with out-
standing senior and junior faculty members. Previous
students from the Gilchrist lab have collaborated exten-
sively with faculty within EEB and other departmentsat UTK. In addition, students have an opportunity to
work with experimentalists and computational biologists
at the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Knoxville is located in beautiful Eastern Tennessee, near
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a biodiversity
hot spot. It features everything from rock climbing
to brewpubs to whitewater kayaking to arcades, and
is in easy driving distance to Chattanooga, Nashville,
Atlanta, and Asheville.
For more information contact: Michael Gilchrist at
mikeg@utk.edu.
All qualied applicants will receive equal consideration
for employment and admission without regard to race,
color, national origin, religion, sex, pregnancy, marital
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical
or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status,
and parental status. In accordance with the require-
ments of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title

Ph. D. Graduate Assistantship
Epigenetics and rapid evolution of insecticide resistance
Insect Agroecology and Evolution Lab
Dr. Yolanda Chen, Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences,
University of Vermont52 EvolDir November 1, 2022
Position availability: Fall 2023
Funding: USDA AFRI grant and teaching assistantship
funds
Collaborators: Dr. Sean Schoville (Univ. of Wisconsin),
Dr. Stephanie McKay (Univ. of Vermont), Dr. Russell
Groves (Univ. of Wisconsin), and Dr. Joe Gunn (Univ.
of Vermont)
Position Description: Agricultural insect pests show a
remarkable ability to evolve resistance to insecticides;
however, the evolutionary processes remain poorly un-
derstood. One possible explanation is that insecticide
exposure may alter epigenetic modications, which alter
heritable patterns of gene expression without actually
changing the underlying DNA sequence. The Colorado
potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, has
been extraordinarily successful at adapting to all in-
secticide classes, including the neonicotinoid insecticide
imidacloprid. As a research group, we are interested in
understanding how epigenetics can contribute to rapid
evolution of insecticide resistance in CPB.
Within the broad framework of epigenetics and insec-
ticide resistance evolution, the student will be able to
develop a unique research program at the intersection
between ecology, evolution, and agricultural entomol-
ogy. Potential topics could include transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance, parent-of-origin eects, the re-
lationship between DNA methylation and gene expres-
sion, germline stress and the mobility of transposable
elements.
Requirements:^ a eB.S. in biology, evolution, ecology, ge-
netics, or related elds. A Master's is helpful but not
required. Previous experience with entomology, molec-
ular genetics, and bioinformatic programming is also
helpful but not required. Excellent written and oral com-
munication skills are expected. Applicants must meet
the requirements of the Graduate College at University
of Vermont.
Lab environment: The Insect Agroecology and Lab
strives to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the
sciences. We welcome all students that are interested in
contributing to those goals.
To apply: Potential applicants should email the follow-
ing: 1) a letter detailing why you are interested in the
position, 2) a CV, and 3) an unocial transcript to Prof.
Yolanda Chen, (Yolanda.Chen@uvm.edu) by Dec. 1 for
full consideration. The applications will be reviewed

Dr. Yolanda Chen, Dept. of Plant and Soil Sciences,
University of Vermont
Position availability: Fall 2023
Funding: USDA AFRI grant and teaching assistantship
funds
Collaborators: Dr. Sean Schoville (Univ. of Wisconsin),
Dr. Stephanie McKay (Univ. of Vermont), Dr. Russell
Groves (Univ. of Wisconsin), and Dr. Joe Gunn (Univ.
of Vermont)
Position Description: Agricultural insect pests show a
remarkable ability to evolve resistance to insecticides;
however, the evolutionary processes remain poorly un-
derstood. One possible explanation is that insecticide
exposure may alter epigenetic modications, which alter
heritable patterns of gene expression without actually
changing the underlying DNA sequence. The Colorado
potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, has
been extraordinarily successful at adapting to all in-
secticide classes, including the neonicotinoid insecticideimidacloprid. As a research group, we are interested in
understanding how epigenetics can contribute to rapid
evolution of insecticide resistance in CPB.
Within the broad framework of epigenetics and insec-
ticide resistance evolution, the student will be able to
develop a unique research program at the intersection
between ecology, evolution, and agricultural entomol-
ogy. Potential topics could include transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance, parent-of-origin eects, the re-
lationship between DNA methylation and gene expres-
sion, germline stress and the mobility of transposable
elements.
Requirements:^ a eB.S. in biology, evolution, ecology, ge-
netics, or related elds. A Master's is helpful but not
required. Previous experience with entomology, molec-
ular genetics, and bioinformatic programming is also
helpful but not required. Excellent written and oral com-
munication skills are expected. Applicants must meet
the requirements of the Graduate College at University
of Vermont.
Lab environment: The Insect Agroecology and Lab
strives to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the
sciences. We welcome all students that are interested in
contributing to those goals.
To apply: Potential applicants should email the follow-
ing: 1) a letter detailing why you are interested in the
position, 2) a CV, and 3) an unocial transcript to Prof.
Yolanda Chen, (Yolanda.Chen@uvm.edu) by Dec. 1 for

ClimateChangeButteryGenomics
The Dasmahapatra lab is recruiting a fully funded PhD
student to investigate the genetic consequences of cli-
mate change-induced range shifts in butteries is being
advertised at the University of York (UK) as part of the
NERC-funded ACCE Doctoral Training Partnership.
The evolutionary consequences of climate change are
likely to be widespread, but are little understood. In
particular, what happens when closely related species
which used to be geographically separated come into
contact as a result of climate-driven shifts to their dis-
tributions?
This PhD will research a model system of hybridisation
due to climate change - as it happens. The brown ar-
gus buttery (Aricia agestis) has moved northwards in
Britain since the 1980s and has recently colonised parts
of the distribution of the northern brown argus (Aricia
artaxerxes). This studentship will examine the extent
to which hybridisation between the two Aricia species
is taking place, the evolutionary consequences of this,
and ultimately assess the likelihood of survival of the
northern species.
The project will involve eldwork in Britain, lab work,
and the bioinformatic analysis of genome sequences. You
will benet from using high quality genome assemblies
from the Darwin Tree of Life Project and ecological
data from the UK Biological Records Centre and But-
tery Conservation. You will benet from access to
York's dynamic research centres, the Leverhulme Cen-
tre for Anthropocene Biodiversity and the Stockholm
Environment Institute.
Natural England is a CASE partner for this project,
and will provide supervision, additional resources for
eldwork, and policy or conservation-based placement
opportunities.
A background in evolutionary genetics and conservation
would be useful, together with an interest in understand-
ing the evolutionary consequences of global change.
Application deadline: January 13, 2023 Interviews: mid-
February 2023 PhD Start Date: 1st October 2023

UZurich BehaviourEvolution
We are seeking a PhD student to join us (Prof. Anna
Lindholm <https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/-
behaviour/behaviour.html >& Dr. Andri Manser) in
a research project at the University of Zurich studying
the ecological and evolutionary impact of a naturally
occurring selsh genetic element (called t haplotype)
on wild house mouse populations. The t haplotype is
a supergene in house mice with two key characteristics.
First, males that carry two copies of the gene (t/t ho-
mozygotes) are sterile. Second, males that carry only
one copy of the t (+/t heterozygotes) pass the gene on
to 95% of their ospring rather than the 50% expected
under Mendelian inheritance (gene drive). As a result,
we expect t haplotypes to genetically propagate despite
its sterility inducing eect, which may have far-reaching
consequences for the populations that harbour them
and which could have implications for the control of
invasive mouse pests.
What will you be doing?
You will study the impact of the t haplotype on mouse
behaviour and reproduction, as well as its ecological
and evolutionary consequences in various experimental
settings, from laboratory experiments, to enclosure pop-
ulations, to a free-living population. Additionally, you
will have the opportunity to contribute to analysis of
relevant large datasets and/or modelling.
What are we looking for?
You are motivated by \why" questions, enjoy working
with animals as well as designing and implementing
experiments to test your ideas. You are collaborative,
enjoy communicating your research and learning new
skills. Experience with data analysis, modelling, andNovember 1, 2022 EvolDir 55
publication experience will be viewed as a bonus. You
are trained in evolutionary biology and bring a relevant
MSc degree or equivalent.
What we oer
The University of Zurich oers a highly international
largely English speaking environment. We oer a
friendly working environment, excellent facilities, great
collaborators, and strong support in developing your
scientic skills and abilities. The project has four years
of funding with a generous salary. Zurich oers great
quality of life, consistently ranking in the top three cities
worldwide.
How to apply
Please submit applications as a single pdf le, including
a letter of motivation that highlights your interest in and
suitability for the project, your CV, and recommenda-
tion letters or contact details of 2 references, by email to
Dr Anna Lindholm (anna.lindholm@ieu.uzh.ch). Screen-

KillishGenomics
Ph.D. and Master's opportunities: The Genomics of
Eco-Evo-Devo in Killishes:
We are seeking highly motivated Ph.D. and Master's stu-
dents to begin research on comparative and functional
genomics of annual and non-annual killish adaptations
to extreme environments. Killishes are part of a highly
diverse group of vertebrates that have evolved the ability
to live in ephemeral ponds via developmental dormancy
(diapause), and environmentally cued hatching. They
also have skewed sex ratios and are thus emerging mod-
els for Eco-Evo-Devo and understanding the integration
of developmental gene regulation and changing environ-
ments. The projects are led by the P.I. Andrew (Drew)
Thompson in the Department of Biological Sciences at56 EvolDir November 1, 2022
Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Students will conduct research on the following topics:
How can vertebrates regulate growth and suspended
animation of multiple, complex organ systems?
How do extremophiles integrate environmental and ge-
netic cues to control hatching?
How do changing environments modulate sexual dier-
entiation?
More specically, the students will investigate the ge-
nomic basis and evolution of killish developmental dor-
mancy, environmentally-cued hatching, and/or sex de-
termination. The students will apply functional genetic
tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis and/or
bioinformatic tools to understand gene, genome, and
chromatin dynamics associated with the aforementioned
developmental phenotypes. Students will also be ex-
pected to undertake an experimental approach to un-
ravel how these genotypes integrate with dierent, ex-
treme environmental conditions to produce phenotypic
diversity and developmental plasticity.
Applicants should have interest and experience in some
of the following: comparative genomics/transcriptomics,genetics, chromatin dynamics, genome annotation, gene
editing (e.g. knockout, transgenesis, etc.), bioinformat-
ics, sh husbandry, sh evolution, and phylogenetics.
The student will work under the supervision of Dr. An-
drew Thompson and will begin the fall of 2023. Please
send any inquiries and notication of interests to Dr.
Andrew Thompson (Andrew.Thompson@wmich.edu).
Please provide a CV and a message describing your
research interests and reasons for considering joining
the Thompson Lab at WMU.

BinghamtonU Two PlantBiologist
ConservationEcol
Dear Colleagues,
We have two tenure track openings at Binghamton Uni-
versity (SUNY) that we hope will attract applications
from evolutionary biologists. Please see description
below for both an Integrative Plant Biologist and a
Conservation Ecologist search.
The Department of Biological Sciences at Bingham-
ton University (SUNY: State University of New York)
invites applications for two tenure-track Assistant Pro-
fessor positions in the area of Integrative Plant Biology
and Conservation Ecology.60 EvolDir November 1, 2022
The ideal Integrative Plant Biology candidate will de-
velop an original research program that addresses fun-
damental questions in plant biology with an emphasis
on plant biotic interactions. The successful candidate
could have areas of specialization that include: genetic
and physiological mechanisms of symbiosis, factors in-
uencing shifts between mutualistic, commensal, and
parasitic relationships, the impact of microbial sym-
bionts on plant responses to biotic and/or abiotic stress,
and/or biochemical communication between plants and
their symbionts.
The ideal candidate in Conservation Ecology will develop
an original research program that addresses fundamen-
tal questions in ecology that apply to issues surrounding
anthropogenic impacts and conservation. We encourage
applicants who incorporate eld and experimental ap-
proaches, consider interactions between ecological and
evolutionary processes, and leverage local natural sys-
tems, including freshwater ecosystems.
For both positions, priority will be given to applicants
whose research program complements and strengthens
interactions between established departmental strengths
in Genetic and Molecular Interactions, Global Change,
and Infectious Disease Biology. Successful candidates
must have a Ph.D. in Biology or a related eld and
will join a diverse biology department with over 30
tenured/tenure-track and teaching faculty members.
They will be expected to develop a vigorous, exter-
nally funded research program that contributes to our
designation as an R1 institution through the training
and mentorship of PhD and MS students, and will also
contribute to the department's teaching mission by in-
structing both undergraduate and graduate courses in
their area of expertise.
The University is committed to encouraging interdis-
ciplinary collaborations on campus through initiatives
and centers, including the Transdisciplinary Area of
Excellence in Data Science, the Center for Integrated
Watershed Studies, and the Transdisciplinary Area of
Excellence in Sustainable Communities. The E. W.
Heier Research and Teaching Greenhouses provide both
controlled-access research space, as well as a public
botanical collection for teaching, outreach, and commu-
nity engagement. In addition, the university's natural
areas for teaching and research cover 600 acres of un-
developed land, including the Nature Preserve and an
outdoor Ecological Research Facility.
The Department of Biological Sciences is committed to
equity and inclusion and is actively working to increase
diversity amongst its faculty. Members of groups his-
torically underrepresented in biology and those from
non-traditional backgrounds are strongly encouraged toapply. Additionally, evidence of a commitment to ad-
vancing equity and inclusion through research, teaching,
or service will be valued.
Review of applications will begin on December 1, 2022,
and continue until positions are lled. Applicants must
have received a Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree by the
anticipated start date (August 15, 2023). Applicants
must submit a cover letter, CV, teaching statement,
research statement, and diversity statement, along with
the names and contact information for three references.

ProgramCoordinator
We seek a program coordinator to support a new post-
baccalaureate program at Oklahoma State University
in Stillwater, OK. Dr. Michael Reichert and Dr. Eliza-
beth McCullagh have recently received funding from the
National Science Foundation (NSF) to create a research-
intensive program for postbaccalaureates at Oklahoma
State University. This program is focused on research
involving anthropogenic impacts on biological processes
(including evolution).
Mitigating the extensive and dramatic eects of human
activities on biological processes is one of the major chal-
lenges facing the STEM workforce in the 21st century.
Therefore, training and capacity building in research on
anthropogenic eects is critical for society and increasing
diversity in these elds is essential both for increasing
opportunities for participation, and to provide the di-
verse set of approaches and experiences necessary to
address these problems. The objective of this proposal
is to build a diverse network of scientists to provide
mentorship and training in cutting-edge research on an-
thropogenic eects on biological processes. Our specic
goals are to foster a scientic community with the focus
on broadening participation and developing a sense of
belonging in the sciences, and to build the capacity to
develop solutions for one of the most pressing scientic
challenges of our time.
We will address these goals through a structured men-
torship program for post-baccalaureate scientists from
underrepresented groups, hosted at Oklahoma State
University, which will be supported by faculty members
Dr. Michael Reichert, Dr. Elizabeth McCullagh, and

***ESEB GLOBAL EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY INI-
TIATIVE (GEBI) - Call for projects***
ESEB aims to foster the development and integra-
tion of local evolutionary research communities from
regions outside of the traditional strongholds of the
discipline and their links with the evolutionary bi-
ology community in Europe. To address this need,
we recently transformed the Global Training Initia-
tive, mainly focused on supporting training activities,
to the Global Evolutionary Biology Initiative (GEBI)
which can provide nancial, organisational and strategic
support as required (https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/-
global-evolutionary-biology-initiative/).
GEBI now welcomes applications to support new
projects in line with its aims (examples include meetings
to establish or strengthen local researcher networks, con-
ducting hands-on workshops to disseminate new tools
or methods, or developing curricula for teaching).
THE DEADLINE FOR THE CALL IS NOVEMBER
25th, 2022.
Applications should include a concise (up to two pages)
description of the proposed activity and a detailed bud-
get (in particularly specifying how the requested GEBI
contribution will be used). Actions fostering evolution-
ary biology in the long term are particularly appreciated,
and applicants are encouraged to describe how their pro-
posals may reach this long-term objective. Maximal
allowance is 10,000 euros/project.
Actions based in Western and Northern Europe, USA,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan are not
eligible for support by GEBI. Actions that are al-
ready covered by other ESEB initiatives/committees,
e.g. outreach activities or travel grants to individual
students/researchers for attending workshops or confer-
ences are not eligible for support by GEBI.
Proposals should be addressed to oce@eseb.org (sub-
ject: GEBI call for proposals 2022). We will acknowl-
edge receipt of all applications within a week. If you118 EvolDir November 1, 2022
have not received our conrmation by then, please con-
tact the ESEB oce again!

Cayenne FrenchGuiana
PoisonDartFrogsGenomics
Postdoctoral position in Cayenne - French Guiana (30
months): Dissection of the genetic basis underlying the
radiation of warning signals in poison dart frogs
Start date: December 1st, 2022
I am looking to hire a postdoctoral researcher (PDR) to
investigate the genetic basis underlying the impressive
diversity of vivid color pattern in the Peruvian Ranit-
omeya poison dart frogs as part of the funded project
RANAPOSA. The identication of these genomic re-
gions will enable to test original hypothesis regarding
the evolution of mimicry convergence between unrelated
species and better understand how warning colorations
can diversify so extensively and yet be maintained at
very small spatial scale. This study investigates three124 EvolDir November 1, 2022
M ullerian mimetic species, Ranitomeya variabilis, R.
imitator and R. fantastica and genetic samples available
includes Mendelian crosses, wild individuals from multi-
ple populations with distinct warning colorations, and
both genome and transcriptomes are already available.
Supervision: The PDR will be based in Cayenne (French
Guiana at the Laboratoire Ecologie, Evolution, In-
teraction des Syst emes Amazonien (LEEISA https:/-
/www.leeisa.cnrs.fr/) and will be advised by Mathieu
CHOUTEAU from the Centre National de la Recherche
Scientique (CNRS). In addition, the PDR will inter-
act with other members of the Ranitomeya consortium:
Kyle Summers (East Carolina University), Adam Stuck-
ert (University of Houston) and Rasmus Nielson (UC
Berkeley).
Requirement: Strong expertise in advanced genomic:
Association mapping, genome scans, detection of intro-
gression and genomic rearrangements, the use of capture
baits, short- and long-reads sequencing, good knowledge
of demographic inferences tools, linux system, statistics
with R.
Good understanding of molecular laboratory techniques:
optimization of DNA extractions, genomic libraries and
sequencing design.
Solid organizational and computational skills: curation
of the genetic samples, DNA extractions and associated
genomic data, handling of genomic datasets generated
using dierent sequencing technologies.
Interest for ecology and evolution: especially in the
processes leading to adaptive radiation, including niche
specialization, reproductive isolation and population
dynamic.
Scientic independence: Excellent analytical and writing
skills, good relational abilities and capacity to innovate,
interest in developing its own research.
Broader context: French Guiana is an overseas depart-
ment of France located between Brazil and Surinam.
Working in Cayenne provides a privilege access to the
living laboratory that is the Amazon but also to an
inexhaustible number of outdoor activities. A large in-
ternational community of ecologists and evolutionary
biologists are involved in research projects in French
Guiana, and many Research institutes interested by
the Amazonian biodiversity are locally present (CNRS,
CIRAD, INRAE, IRD, Institut Pasteur, Universit e de

DukeU PlantGenetics
POSITION: I am seeking a postdoctoral scholar inter-
ested in investigating the evolution the genetic and devel-
opmental evolution of oral color patterns in the genus
Clarkia. Please see references listed below for work our
lab has published on this project. I am particularly inter-
ested in someone who can bring innovative approaches
to identifying the genes controlling the expression of
various pattern elements such as spots, speckling and
white patches. While the transcription factors responsi-
ble for activating the anthocyanin enzyme-coding genes
that produce these elements (e.g. R2R3Mybs) are well
understood, the genes regulating those transcription
factors are largely unknown, as is true generally for
the anthocyanin pathway. Identifying genes involved
in this second level of regulation will be key for un-
derstanding how the regulatory networks controlling
pattern formation evolve. In addition, because Clarkia
is a non-model organism, development of tools such
as permanent or transient transformation, in situ hy-
bridization, and/or viral induced gene silencing (VIGS)
will facilitate progress on this project.
POSITION DETAILS: The position is a full-time ap-
pointment initially for one year, with the possibility
of extension depending on grant funding. The post-
doc will have the opportunity to participate in writing
a grant proposal for additional funding. The salary
is$54,840/year with benets. Target start date is 1
January 2023, but there is exibility.
QUALIFICATIONS: Candidates for this position should
have obtained, at the time of the position start date,
a Ph.D. degree in the biological sciences. They should
have a record of rst-author publications demonstrating
competence in critical scientic thinking and research
creativity. Experience with one or more of the following
is desirable: transcriptomic assessment of gene expres-
sion, including associated bioinformatic skills; single-cell
or small-scale RNA sequencing; experience with planttransformation, VIGS, and/or in situ hybridization;
training in population genetics, evolutionary biology
or evolutionary developmental biology (EVO-DEVO).
DUTIES: The primary duty is to investigate the develop-
mental processes that determine the spatial expression
domain of oral pattern elements and how those do-
mains evolve. The successful candidate will be given
latitude in deciding which oral pattern elements to in-
vestigate. Opportunities for mentoring undergraduates
will be available. There will be signicant opportu-
nities for professional growth and career development
activities.
APPLICATION: Applications should be sub-
mitted to Academic Jobs Online at https://-
academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/23269 and should
include the following :
* Cover letter that describes your interest in the po-
sition and your experiences relevant to the project *
CV * Copies of up to 3 published papers demonstrating
your skills and preparation relevant to this position *
Names and contact information for three professional
references * A detailed description (not more than 1
page) explaining how you would address the following
problem:
Clarkia xantiana petals have a red spot surrounded by
a white (non-pigmented) halo against a more lightly
colored background. The background and spot are con-
trolled by separate R2R3Myb pigment initiators. There
are three naturally occurring mutants: (1) lacking halo,
but with spot and background pigmentation present;
(2) lacking both spot and halo, but with background
pigmentation throughout the petal; and (3) spot present,
background pigmentation absent. The owers are small,
the spot being 3-5 mm in diameter and the halo being
another 2-4 mm wide. Explain how you would attempt
to determine the developmental basis of the halo and
how it evolved as a novel character in this species.
Applications will be considered as they arrive and must
be submitted by 15 December 2022.

MitonuclearCoAdaptation
Postdoc opportunity Jagiellonian University in
Krak >1
2w, Poland
Mitonuclear co-adaptation and speciation in amphibians
We seek a motivated PhD interested in pursuing a post-
doc focused on mitonuclear co-adaptation and its role
in amphibian speciation.
Mitochondrial protein complexes involved in aerobic
respiration are encoded in mitochondrial DNA and nu-
clear DNA, a condition necessitating co-adaptation be-
tween the two genomes. Mitonuclear co-adaptation is
broken up by recombination when individuals from di-
vergent lineages (such as dierent species) mate and
produce hybrid progeny. Mitonuclear incompatibilities,
i.e. the mismatch between gene products encoded by
the mtDNA of one species and nDNA of another, may
constitute important postzygotic reproductive barriers.
However, several basic aspects of this potentially uni-
versal reproductive isolation mechanism remain poorly
known. The goal of this project is to evaluate the role
of mitonuclear co-adaptation in amphibian speciation.November 1, 2022 EvolDir 129
The post-doc will participate in attaining one or more
of the following aims of the project: (1) assess the con-
cordance of patterns of sequence divergence in mtDNA-
and nDNA-encoded genes involved in mitochondrial
metabolism across the contact zones of hybridizing am-
phibian species, (2) evaluate the causes of widespread
mtDNA introgression in amphibians, (3) assay the func-
tional and tness consequences of mitonuclear incom-
patibility in tadpoles.
The post-doc will join a team of researchers led by Ma-
ciej Pabijan (http://zap-uj.pl/pabijan en.html) at the
Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research at Jagiel-
lonian University in Krak >1
2w. The position involves
molecular lab work (targeted sequencing), demographic
modelling and participation in an experiment on tadpole
tness and function in relation to mitonuclear discor-
dance. Depending on his/her interests, the candidate
may also contribute to eld work (amphibian sampling)
in Poland and beyond. The project is funded by the
National Science Centre of Poland. The post-doc posi-
tion is for 30 months with a salary of ~7 000 PLN ( ~1
550 Euro) per month, which is reasonable considering
the lower living costs of Krak >1

LinkpingU
QuantGeneticsPigmentation
A two year post-doctoral position looking a the genetic
basis of pigmentation and in relation to behavioural
and other life history traits is available at Link??ping
University Biology dept, Sweden. The postdoc will work
with Prof. Dominic Wright (PI). This topic will be in-
vestigated using two distinct model systems. The rst
system involves assessing the genetic basis of structural
iridescence as part of an ERC-funded project study-ing feralisation in chickens. Structural colour is one of
the three main forms of coloration in animals, often
manifested as iridescence. Iridescence is a phenomenon
that produces a vivid metallic colouring depending on
viewing angle. Layered or otherwise periodic arrange-
ments in feathers, cuticle and scales cause these striking
interference eects. To fully understand these functions
and trade-os it is necessary to dissect their genetic
basis. However, whilst the genetics of pigment-based
colour have been investigated for almost a century, al-
most nothing is known about the developmental basis
and the gene-regulatory mechanisms underlying struc-
tural colour. Structural colour is far more complex
than its pigment-based counter-part, and involves the
organization of cells in layers to form periodic keratin
complexes often in the form of multilayers. Detailed
3D measurements will be performed using Transmission
and Scanning Electron microscopy on already sampled
feathers in combination with genome wide mapping to
identify the components to structural colour. These
birds have previously been phenotyped for a variety of
behavioural and life history traits, allowing analysis of
pleiotropy and linkage between these trait types.
The second study system using an Asellus aquaticus
crustacean model. This system is based on comparing
a cave-adapted population with nearby stream and lake
populations. The cave-adapted loss of pigmentation
is also mirrored in the dierent lake ecotypes in the
surrounding region, depending on the lake substrate.
We have previously mapped pigmentation loci using
a lab-based inter-cross (Bakovic et al 2021, Molecular
Ecology), but this will now be broadened to mapping
pigmentation loci in the surrounding lake ecotype pop-
ulations using a GWAS approach, also allowing the si-
multaneous mapping of other ecotype traits to ascertain
how these are regulated and also whether simultaneous
selection is acting on these traits.
This post doctoral position requires a candidate with
knowledge of quantitative genetics/ evolutionary genet-
ics, with genomic mapping experience a plus. Working
with R and bioinformatics knowledge is also benecial.
This will be a two-year post doctoral position, paid via
a stipendium, at Link??ping University. Please contact
Dominic Wright (dominic.wright@liu.se) for further in-
formation or to submit a CV and cover letter. The
position will start in the beginning of 2022, with some
exibility regarding the exact start date. Closing date
is the 4th November 2021.

Postdoctoral position in historical DNA, extinction risk,
and a genetic time series
A postdoc position is available to work on historical
DNA from bird museum skin specimens and fresh sam-
ples to develop a novel real-time assessment of genetic
response to anthropogenic environmental change across
multiple bird species following rst human arrival in
a pristine environment. The time series is designed to
examine the long-term processes leading to variation in
extinction risk between closely related species, compar-
ing dierences in demographic and selective responses
to common environmental changes. The position is part
of a project funded by the French National Research
Agency (ANR), that links competences of two research
centres in France. In Toulouse, the UMR CAGT is
among the leading laboratories worldwide in ancient
DNA studies, and will be the postdoc's base for the
historical DNA guidance and wet-lab work.
In Paris, the French National Museum of Natural His-
tory (MNHN) houses important specimens for the study,
and is also home to expertise in genome-wide demo-
graphic analyses and method development, as well as in
links between extinction risk, evolutionary history, and

Evolutionary history is expected to play a major role
in determining which species decline in population size
to extinction in response to environmental change, but
the processes by which this comes about are poorly un-
derstood. Although population genetic studies provide
much promise to understand the microevolutionary pro-
cesses behind macroevolutionary patterns of extinction
risk, inferences can be limited by our condence in the
timescales inferred, and by the scale of such studies,
which frequently include only one lineage. As a key-
player in project ANR Suscept-Ext, the postdoc will
tackle both of these issues, applying ancient DNA meth-
ods to museum samples to obtain a genome-wide time
series for multiple Mascarene island bird lineages that
dier in abundance and other biological traits. Islands
in the Mascarene archipelago (Mauritius & R >1
2union),
Indian Ocean, are unusual among sizable and biologi-
cally diverse landmasses worldwide, in that they had no
human population until European arrival 400 years ago.
Therefore, there exist museum samples and subfossils
spanning the full duration of anthropogenic environmen-
tal change, allowing a real-time assessment of genetic
response to environmental changes of known timing and
across multiple species following rst human presence.
We are looking for candidates suitable for one or both
of the following goals:
1)Applying existing protocols to obtain shotgun genomes
and/or hyRAD data from museum skin samples (toe-
pads), complementing hyRAD data already obtained
from sub-fossils. Work to be conducted at the University
of Toulouse, CAGT lab.
2)Analysing the resulting genetic time series (modern
and historical genome- wide data of varying complete-
ness) to track temporal changes in demography (and/or
selection) since rst human arrival in the Mascarenes
~400 generations ago. Work to ideally be conducted
at the Paris Museum (MNHN, ISYEB research centre),
interacting with the Paris- based team.
We have approximately 1 year and 7 months of postdoc
contract remaining (depending on experience), to be
allocated according to suitability for the above goals,
starting between the Early Spring and Summer of 2023.
A PhD student who began in January 2022 will work
alongside the postdoc involved in data analysis, and has
already developed the primary bioinformatic pipeline
for data alignment.
Candidates should have a strong interest in the broad
theme of the study - understanding the role of evolution-November 1, 2022 EvolDir 133
ary history in determining which species decline towards
extinction in response to environmental change. Fur-
thermore, those applying to work on the analyses should

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Bioinformatics and Compar-
ative Genomics
A postdoctoral training position is currently available
in the Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch
(CSGB) of the National Human Genome Research In-
stitute (NHGRI). The position is in the laboratory of
Andy Baxevanis, Ph.D., whose research group uses com-
parative genomics approaches to better-understand the
molecular innovations that drove the surge of diversity
in early animal evolution. The overarching theme of
Dr. Baxevanis' research program is focused on how non-
traditional animal models can be used to convey critical
insights into human disease research, in line with the
NIH Intramural Research Program's renewed emphasis
on developing new animal models for the study of basic
biology.
With this translational context in mind, Dr. Baxe-
vanis' group is currently leading international eorts
to sequence two cnidarian species: Hydractinia and
Podocoryna. The regenerative abilities of these colonial
hydrozoans make them excellent models for the studyof key questions related to pluripotency, allorecognition,
and stem cell biology, work that will be signicantly ad-
vanced by the availability of high-quality whole-genome
sequencing data from these organisms. The success-
ful applicant will have the opportunity to develop and
apply bioinformatic approaches to these and other large-
scale genomic data sets, focusing on the evolution of
specic protein families and biological pathways that
have putative roles in disease causation.
Candidates should have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D.
or equivalent degree in bioinformatics, computational
biology, computer science, molecular biology, or a closely
related eld. Candidates with a background in compar-
ative genomics or evolutionary biology are particularly
encouraged to apply. Programming skills and experience
in the application of computational methods to genomic
data are highly desirable. Applicants must possess good
communication skills and be uent in both spoken and
written English. The ability to learn how to use new
software and quickly become expert in its use, critical
thinking, problem-solving abilities, and the ability to
work semi-independently are required.
The NIH Intramural Research Program is on the
Bethesda, Maryland campus and oers a wide array of
training opportunities for scientists early in their careers.
The funding for this position is stable and oers the
trainee wide latitude in the design and pursuit of their
research project. The successful candidate will have ac-
cess to NHGRI's established and robust bioinformatics
infrastructure, as well as a Top 500 high-performance
computing resource available through NIH's Center for
Information Technology.
Interested applicants should submit a curriculum vitae,
a detailed letter of interest, and the names of three poten-
tial references to Dr. Baxevanis at andy@mail.nih.gov.
Postdoctoral traineeships are not available to scientists
who have more than ve years of relevant research ex-
perience since the receipt of their most recent doctoral|
degree.

Good afternoon,
We are looking for a creative evolutionary biologist to
lead genomic analyses of sap-feeding insects, e.g aphids
etc. Chromosome-level assemblies, transcriptomes, pro-
teomes and population genomics data for many species
are already available
Postdoctoral Researcher Salary: 33,050 - 40,750 per an-
num depending on qualications and experience. Con-
tract: 3 years, full time Location: John Innes Centre,
Norwich, UK. Closing date: 26th October 2022 Refer-
ence: 1004338
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Researcher
to join the group of Prof Saskia Hogenhout <https:/-
/www.jic.ac.uk/people/saskia-hogenhout/ >(twitter:
@SaskiaHogenhout) at the John Innes Centre (JIC) to

The overall aim of the project is to identify key evolution-
ary events that enabled sap-feeding hemipteran insects
and their microbial symbionts/pathogens to colonize
plants.
Our established systems include a range of sap-feeding in-
sect species, such as aphids, psyllids, whiteies, leafhop-
pers and spittlebugs/froghoppers, and knowledge of
their microbiomes, plant host ranges and feeding be-
haviours. We have generated annotated chromosome-
level genome assemblies, transcriptomes, proteomes
and/or population genomics data for 40 hemipteran
species. See for example Mathers et al. (2022) <https:/-
/doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5908005 >, Biello et al. (2021)
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3368385 >and Biello
et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4681171
>.
The successful applicant will be able to creatively ex-
plore these -omics data to elucidate key evolution-
ary events that enabled plant colonization of sap-
feeding hemipteran insects and their microbial sym-
bionts/pathogens. They will conduct comparative

riety of approaches to identify genes involved in plant
colonization, feeding and the modulation of plant pro-
cesses. Additional genome and transcriptome data may
be generated as appropriate. The candidate will be
encouraged to publish their ndings as preprints, public
data repositories and open access peer-reviewed publica-
tions and develop ways to make genomes and associated
data easily accessible to a wide audience.
The post holder will possess at least an PhD or equiv-
alent experience in Evolutionary Genomics, Bioinfor-
matics, Genetics or related elds and has experience in
the processing and analysis of next-generation sequence
data and conducting population genomic analyses. Theywill have a solid understanding of statistics in biology,

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION IN FLO-
RAL EVOLUTION
The Schenk Lab at Ohio University is looking for a Post-
doctoral Researcher to start an NSF Funded project
in January 2023. The position will be in person in
Athens, Ohio for two years and includes travel support
for research and conferences.
Brief Project Overview: Flowers have experienced ex-
traordinary morphological changes through evolutionary
time that includes multiple origins of novel, non-fertile
structures. Because owers are a complex network of
interconnected parts, they provide an ideal system for
studying integrated-trait evolution in response to func-
tional cooption. We are investigating coopted oral
structures called staminodes, which are sterile stamens
that can perform novel functions, such as nectar produc-
tion, pollinator attraction, or enhanced pollen dispersal
or deposition. Staminodes provide an exceptional op-
portunity for revealing the evolutionary consequences of
functional cooption in an integrated system. The project
will study staminodes in Mentzelia (Loasaceae) to an-
swer the question: Is there an evolutionary response to
compensate for the loss of reproductive function when
a structure is coopted to perform a novel function?
Research tasks: The postdoctoral research associate will
be expected to conduct experiments, including genomic
library preparation and sequencing, phylogenomics, phy-
logenetic comparative approaches, morphological char-
acterization of oral traits, oral manipulation exper-
iments with natural pollinators, and eld work in the
western U.S. The successful candidate will have the op-
portunity to attend and present work in national and
international meetings and publish research results. The
postdoctoral research associate will co-mentor under-
graduate students and collaborate with a Ph.D. student,
research associates, and the PI.
Qualications: The Postdoctoral Scholar must have
earned their Ph.D. in Botany, Biology, or a closely re-
lated eld before the hiring date. Successful candidates
are preferred to have research experience in plant evolu-
tion, phylogenetic comparative approaches, oral mor-
phology and evolution, and/or pollinator ecology.
Application process: Please submit a cover letter that
outlines your previous research experiences, CV, contactinformation (name, phone number, email, and mailing
address) for three professional references, and one publi-
cation that best represents your qualications to https:/-
/www.ohiouniversityjobs.com/postings/43426. Applica-
tions received by Oct. 31st, 2022 will receive full consid-

PopulationGenomics
Dear EvolDir mailing list members,
The Kraemer lab (@PlantAdaptation) is looking to re-
cruit a postdoctoral researcher in population genomics
for 3 years (contract can be extended by another 3 y or
more, based on performance) to complement our inter-138 EvolDir November 1, 2022
disciplinary team that studies the genetic basis of trait
diversication in Arabidopsis halleri (ANR 1089). In
addition, a one-year postdoc position is open for appli-
cations for a \Data Steward" from 1st January 2023
(ANR 1093). Deadline for applications is 31 October
2022. (Ads below)
At present, we are particularly interested in demographic
modeling in the diploid outcrossing perennial species
A. halleri and in the use of coalescent simulations for
the timing of genomic events, such as specic structural
mutations in the genome of A. halleri that we identied
as candidates for major phenotypic divergence in heavy
metal tolerance or hyperaccumulation in the species, or
the introgression of specic genes (gene sets) into the
sister species A. arenosa.
In addition, we have lineage- and population-specic
chromosome-scale long-read genome assemblies, and
their analysis, annotation, and examination at specic
loci of interest is of high priority for us, as well as
completing additional long read-based assemblies, with
the aim to understand how structural variation arises
and how it contributes to adaptive variation in extreme
physiological traits in Arabidopsis halleri.
We have re-sequenced the genomes of ca. 900 individuals
of A. halleri from all across Europe, as well as of about
100 A. halleri and A. arenosa individuals from an area
where metal hyperaccumulation was introgressed from
A. halleri into A. arenosa. We have already completed a
lot of analyses including GWAS, some genome scans for
introgressions, and others, and we have highly promising
results to build on.

networks. The successful candidate will make substan-
tial contributions to one or several ongoing projects
addressing the genetic basis of local adaptation and
rapid evolution in the extremophile plant species Ara-
bidopsis halleri (1, 3). Activities could include, for
example, population genomics and demographic analy-
ses, genome assembly, genome annotation and genome
analysis (e.g. structural variation), or the analysis of
large-scale transcriptome data and transcriptional net-
works in A. halleri.
The work will take advantage of the enormous within-
species trait diversity among ca. 850 eld-collected A.halleri accessions in our lab, which originate from 165
well-characterized eld sites and were edaphically and
ionomically indexed in the eld (2). Large-scale datasets
from short-read and long-read genome re-sequencing,
transcriptomic and phenotypic data are available and
under analysis in our lab through ERC Advanced Grant
LEAP-EXTREME. The successful candidate will have
excellent programming skills using R/bioconductor,
Python or Perl, and will have demonstrated the ability to
manage and work with large-scale biological datasets, to
cooperate and communicate within an interdisciplinary
research team and to work independently. We oer a
long-term contract with a possibility of extension, the
opportunity for professional development towards an
independent career, and a salary at TvL-E13 or E14

*Evolution of a classic supergene   ^A>^A1
2\ Carl Tryggers
Postdoctoral Fellowship*
A two-year Carl Tryggers Postdoctoral Fellowship is
now available to work on supergene evolution in the
Slotte lab at Stockholm University.
*Project* Supergenes control complex phenotypic poly-
morphisms under balancing selection through the preser-
vation of advantageous allelic combinations. Distyly in
owering plants is an iconic example of a multi-trait
polymorphism controlled by a supergene. In this project,
we aim to study the evolution of the distyly supergene
in Linum (wild axseed species), a plant system that is
ideal for this purpose. We have recently discovered and
characterized the distyly supergene in the species Linum
tenue (Guti errez-Valencia et al. 2022, Current Biology;
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.08.042). Building
on this discovery, the postdoc will test hypotheses on
the evolution and loss of the Linum distyly supergene
in a comparative framework, using genomic data from
a larger set of Linum species.
*Main responsibilities* The main responsibility of the
Carl Tryggers postdoctoral fellow will be to lead and con-
duct evolutionary genomic analyses of the evolution of
the distyly supergene and its repeated loss. Depending
on the applicant's interests, there are also opportunities
to study the genomic impact of mating system shifts
associated with breakdown of distyly in Linum. For this
purpose, the postdoc will be able to draw on high-quality
genome assemblies, population genomic data and expres-
sion data for a larger set of Linum species, generated as
part of the ERC-funded project SuperGenE.
*Qualications* The position is for two years, funded by
a stipend from the Carl Tryggers foundation. According
to the rules of the Tryggers foundation, the PhD degree
must be less than six years old, and applicants must
receive nal approval by the foundation.
Applicants are required to hold a PhD, preferably in
evolutionary genetics, population genetics, comparative
genomics, bioinformatics, or related topics. The candi-140 EvolDir November 1, 2022
date should have proven experience in genomic analyses,
ideally with an evolutionary genetic focus. Candidates
should have strong writing skills, be able to work in-
dependently as well as together with team members,
and exhibit drive and motivation for the research task.
Excellent prociency in English (the working language
of the group) is required.
*Environment* The Carl Tryggers postdoctoral fellow
will be based in the international research group of
Prof. Tanja Slotte (http://tanjaslottelab.se), consisting
of PhD students, postdocs and technical sta with a
common interest in plant evolutionary genomics. We of-
fer a friendly working environment and access to training
in both subject-specic skills and soft skills. The group
is part of an active population genetics and genomics
research community at Stockholm University and has
full access to facilities for molecular genetic lab work
and plant work, as well as high-performance computing
infrastructure. The Stockholm University campus is
located only four metro stops from the centre of Stock-
holm, one of the most beautiful and dynamic European
cities (https://www.visitstockholm.com). Stockholm
University strives to be a workplace free from discrimi-
nation and with equal opportunities for all.
*Application* To apply for the fellowship, please email
a pdf with a cover letter motivating your interest and
suitability for the fellowship, a CV including contact
information to 2-3 references, a publication list and a
copy of your PhD diploma directly to tanja.slotte@su.se.

Applications are invited for a Temporary 3 yearpost of a UCD Post-Doctoral Research Fellow Level
1 within UCD Biology and Environmental Science.
Atlantic salmon is aected by aemoebic gill disease
AGD that causes signicant losses to the aquaculture
industry. The overall aim of the proposed work is to
increase understanding of gill disease in salmon and
provide targeted therapies for treatment. The amoeba,
Neoparameoba perurans, and the associated eukaryote
symbiont, Perkinsela sp., cause AGD and is associated
with signicant mortality in, primarily, the Atlantic
salmon farming industry, but also cause disease in other
farmed sh species. The Post-Doctoral Research Fellow
will undertake de-novo whole genome sequencing of both
the amoeba and the symbiont as well as establishing
the microbiom of the amoeba. Further, dierent strains
of the amoeba will be resequenced to detect genetic
variance among strains. Finally, a strain specic
environmental DNA assay will be developed to assist
in early detection of the disease. The Post-Doctoral
Research Fellow will also work with other aspects and
partners within the Science Foundation Ireland funded
GIDAS project that is a collaboration between The
Atlantic Technical University and University College
Dublin. The successful candidate will be expected to
be based in Dublin but will also spend time at The
Atlantic Technical University in Galway. This is a
research focused role, where you will conduct a specied
programme of research supported by research training
and development under the supervision and direction
of a Principal Investigator. The primary purpose of
the role is to further develop your research skills and
competences, including the processes of publication in
peer-reviewed academic publications, the development
of funding proposals, the mentorship of graduate
students along with the opportunity to develop your
skills in research led teaching. Fixed Salary euro 39,522
per annumAppointment on the above range will be
dependent upon qualications and experience. Closing
date: 17:00hrs (local Irish time) on 7th November 2022.
Applications must be submitted by the closing date
and time specied. Any applications which are still in

RedDeerGenomics
We oer a 2-years post-doctorate position (expected
starting time on 2023 February 1st) to quantify and
understand the relative eects of the environment and
sport hunting on the dynamics, genetics and genomics
of red deer populations. The red deer is of particular
interest in Europe and France, both from a sociological
and a hunting point of view. The main objective of the
post-doc fellow is to analyse and publish scientic papers
from historical demographic data on the long-term ( ~
30 years) monitoring of individual red deer at La Petite
Pierre (Bas-Rhin, France) and Chambord (Loir-et-Cher,
France). Another component of the post-doc work re-
lates to the genetics of these populations for which we
need to estimate the genetic population parameters (ge-
netic diversity, eective population size, genes under
selection, genomic basis of individual heterogeneity ^A^A')
using both classical molecular genetic and genomic ap-
proaches. We nally aim at linking the genetic charac-
teristics of the red deer populations living in contrasting
environments (closed vs open populations) or hunting
policies (trophy hunting vs. population control) with
the observed population dynamics (demo-genetics).
The post-doctorate fellow will contribute, with LBBE
teams, to the framing of the scientic questions from
which wildlife managers and the French Oce for Biodi-
versity will derive management policies and advices for
a better control of red deer populations. Although most
demographic data are readily available, please consider
that some time is needed to understand the structure
and limitations of the data sets. Abundance, hunting
bags, body mass, reproduction and survival data will
serve to describe the long-run population dynamics of
the 2 red deer populations. Density-dependence, re-
sponses to weather and its interaction with hunting
will be investigated into details. An important goal
of this work will be the generalisation of the results /
model to other red deer populations for which we only
have partial demographic data. Ultimately, we should
provide wildlife managers with clear and applicable man-
agement policies for such a sexually dimorphic species.
We envision an integrated approach (joined analyses of
dierent data type) for statistical analyses given the
heterogeneity of the data we have at hand. We expect
the post-doctorate fellow to have a strong will and mo-
tivation to dig into genetic genomics concepts and toolsto complete the second part of the project. Beside the
description of standard genetic measures (genetic diver-
sity, eective population size ^A^A'), we will identify genes
under selection in dierent ecological contexts in order
to uncover the genomic bases of individual heterogeneity
in life history traits (e.g. reproduction, survival ^A^A')
and to infer the evolutionary history of the studied pop-
ulations. The candidate will receive help and support
from the bioinformatic and biotechnology teams of the
LBBE, in addition to a master student in spring 2024.
The ultimate goal of the project is to build a conceptual
model to describe and understand the interaction be-
tween genetics and population dynamics (demo-genetic
modelling).
This project is implemented in two study territories of
the French Oce of Biodiversity (OFB) with long-term
deer monitoring oering contrasting quasi-experimental
conditions: - La Petite Pierre: mid-mountain forest en-
vironment, open territory, - Chambord: lowland forest
environment, closed territory. These two territories oer
an exceptional history of deer population monitoring:
- La Petite Pierre: hunting and biometric and demo-
graphic data by CMR since 1975, counting data since
1978, genetic data (tissue samples) since 2006, - Cham-
bord: hunting and biometric data, since 1980, count
data since 1985, and demographic data by CMR and
genetic data (tissue samples) since 2014.
Work context The host lab is the Biometry and Evolu-
tionary Biology Lab (LBBE, UMR CNRS 5558: https:/-
/lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/) from the University of Lyon 1,
CNRS and VetAgroSup, located in the outskirt of Lyon,
France. Almost 200 people contribute to the research at
the LBBE that brings together mathematical modelling
and IT to answers questions in ecological, evolutionary
and health (humans, animals) sciences. The LBBE is
among the most important ecology lab in France, with
a long history of scientic collaborations with partners
in charge of studies and research on wildlife such as the
French Oce for Biodiversity and with wildlife managers
(national park services, Game and Wildlife services).
The post-doc will work in close collaboration with Mary-
line PELLERIN (French Oce for Biodiversity, Conser-
vation and sustainable management of exploited species
department), Christophe BONENFANT (Evolutionary
demography Team at the LBBE), S ebastien DEVIL-

UNevada Reno
PlantGeneticManagement
The Leger and Parchman labs within the Department of
Biology at the University of Nevada, Reno are recruit-
ing a postdoctoral scientist to work collaboratively on
initiating a genetic management plan for plants used in
ecological restoration, rehabilitation, and reclamation,
focusing on the western US. Because plant species dif-
fer in evolutionary history, distribution, degree of local
adaptation, ease of seed collection or agricultural pro-
duction, and restoration methods, there is no \one size
ts all" approach to seed source decisions that will work
for all plant species or all restoration projects. With
this project, we plan to create the scaolding needed
to consider how to best collect, preserve, and deploy
plants with dierent evolutionary histories and life his-
tory characteristics, for dierent uses. This project
will involve collaboration with researchers in state and
federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service Rocky
Mountain Research Station (RMRS), Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS), or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
state wildlife agencies, as well as non-governmental or-ganizations. A candidate with a background in eco-
logical or molecular genetics, experience in ecological
restoration or native plant ecology, strong leadership,
organizational, and interpersonal skills will be needed to
eectively communicate information to a diverse back-
ground of people representing the restoration commu-
nity.
Initial work will be to outline and describe the ideal
format and content of a genetic management plan, using
literature reviews and conversations with agency person-
nel, researchers, and seed growers. We envision develop-
ing multiple case studies using focal species and real-life
restoration scenarios, and using these case studies to fa-
cilitate discussion about the types of decisions that man-
agers might make under dierent circumstances. These
discussions could happen at a virtual meeting, where
the post-doctoral researcher would facilitate discussion
among scientists, or could happen as one-on-one discus-
sions with agency personnel and genetic researchers. We
expect a peer-reviewed publication to come from this
work, along with a working guide for managers; there
are also opportunities to collaborate in ongoing research
in the Leger and Parchman labs, as well as opportunities
to develop side-projects related to ecological restoration
or restoration genetics. Ultimately, our goal is to begin
to create a framework to inform the genetically respon-
sible collection, agricultural increase, and use of native
seeds based on the best available science.
This is a full-time, two-year position oered at an annual
salary of up to $57,000, and the selected candidate will
work in a friendly and collaborative environment at the
University of Nevada, Reno.

UOxford WildPopulationEvolution
A postdoctoral position is available to work on a NERC
funded project titled \Linking climate variability and ex-
treme events to demography and evolution in replicated
wild populations" led by Prof Ben Sheldon, together
with Dr Eleanor Cole and Dr Charlotte Regan, based at
the Edward Grey Institute in the Department of Biology
at the University of Oxford. The position is funded for 3
years from 1 Dec 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter.
The main responsibilities of the post are to conduct
research using long-term data from studies of wild great
and blue tit populations to understand the implications
of climatic variability, and increases in climatic variabil-
ity, on selection, evolutionary dynamics and demography.
Much of the focus will be on the long-term population
studies based in Wytham Woods near Oxford, now in
their 75th year, but the project will also broaden the
focus to include other populations with individual-level
data studied through the SPI-Birds framework (https:/-
/spibirds.org/en). In recent years these populationshave been exemplars of how populations respond to
changes in mean climate, but recent analyses show that
both within- and between-year variance in key climatic
drivers is increasing.
The key questions to be addressed by the work include:
(1) To understand how within- and between-year vari-
ance in key climatic drivers inuence natural selection
and demographic variation within populations. (2) To
understand the implications of changes in climatic vari-
ance for tness within and between generations. (3) To
link analyses of variation in demography and selection
to micro- geographic environmental variation. (4) To
conduct cross-population analyses of selection and de-
mographic dependence on climatic variance, and seek
to understand between-population variation in their
eects.
The post is supported by eld technician and eld assis-
tant posts, and resources to enable collection of ne-scale
environmental data, and based in an active research
group of ~15 graduate students and postdocs.
The University of Oxford is committed to equality and
valuing diversity. All applicants will be judged on merit,
according to the selection criteria.
This post is full time and available from 1 Dec 2022,
or as soon as possible thereafter. The closing date for
applications is 12.00 noon on 9 Nov 2022, interviews are

Postdoctoral position in evolutionary ecologyNovember 1, 2022 EvolDir 159
https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/details/-
?positionId=550546 A position as a postdoctoral
researcher in evolutionary ecology/biomechanics is
available at the Department of Ecology and Genetics,
Plant Ecology and Evolution Program.
his postdoctoral position forms part of the Human Fron-
tier Science Program project \Bridging robotics and
buzz pollination: Reconstructing a bee's buzz through
microrobotics" (2022-2025). It represents a collabora-
tion between the research groups of Dr. Mario Vallejo-
Marin (Uppsala University, Sweden) and Dr. Noah
Jaeris (University of Massachussetts, Lowe, U.S.A.).
Our project exploits new advances in micro-robotics to
study a fundamental interaction between bees and ow-
ers during buzz pollination, a phenomenon that includes
thousands of plant and bee species around the world.
During buzz pollination, bees from as many as 11,000
species use their indirect ight muscles to generate vi-
brations to shake pollen out of owers. Buzz pollination
captures one of the most striking and widespread ex-
amples of oral convergence, occurring in more than
20% of owering plant families, including crops, such as
tomatoes, which depend on vibration-producing bees.
Our project's main goal is to develop new micro-robotic
approaches combined with experiments in laboratory
and eld settings to study the vibrations produced by
diverse bee species and their eect on pollen release. We
will address the central question of how diversity of bee
vibrations translates to functional variation in pollen
release of buzz-pollinated owers.
The postdoctoral researcher based at Uppsala will work
on measuring bee vibrations in both eld and laboratory
settings, growing buzz-pollinated owers, and testing
the dynamics of pollen release triggered by micro-robots
developed by the U.S.A. team. Both teams will work in
close collaboration with each other to develop and test
the micro-robots and compare them with bee vibrations
on owers.
The multidisciplinarity of the project makes it suitable
to highly motivated candidates from a variety of research
backgrounds and interests, from pollination, botany, be-
haviour, and evolution to biomechanics and biophysics,
among others. The project has opportunities to expand
the research directions in conjunction with the research
team.
Duties These include plant growth and care, animal
(bees) maintenance and behavioural observations, eld-
work locally and overseas, laboratory work with mechan-
ical and electronic devices, computer work (e.g., data
entry, analysis, programming), manuscript preparation,
supervision of students, participation in lab activities
such as journal clubs, discussions, attendance to confer-ences, and presenting the results of the study in talks
and posters.
Qualications required To qualify for an employment
as a postdoctoral researcher you must have a PhD de-
gree or a foreign degree equivalent to a PhD degree
in a relevant eld (e.g., evolutionary biology, biology,
botany, entomology, biomechanics). The PhD degree
must have been obtained no more than three years prior
to the application deadline. The three-year period can
be extended due to circumstances such as sick leave,
parental leave, duties in labour unions, etc. Ability to
work with plants and bees, ability to travel and conduct
eldwork overseas during the summer months, and ex-
perience with statistical analyses (e.g., R) are required.
We attach great importance to personal qualities such
as independence, initiative, exibility, ability to coop-
erate, creativity, and problem-solving analytical skills.
Candidates must be able to express themselves fully in
spoken as well as written English.
Qualications desired Knowledge of programming and
scripting languages (e.g., MatLab, LabView, Mathe-
matica, Python), and expertise in one or more elds
including evolutionary biology, botany, ecology, entomol-
ogy, biophysics, biomechanics, and electrical engineering
are highly desirable. Expertise with working with bees
and plants in eld and lab settings is also desirable.
Experience on biomechanics or a willingness to learn
are welcome.

Dates: May 10-19, 2023 Location: Dauphin Is-
land Sea Lab, Dauphin Island, AL Cost: Free!
Application deadline: February 10, 2023 Web-
site: https://www.kocotlab.com/2022-disl-meiofauna-
diversity-and-taxonomy.html The overarching goals of
this course are to help train the next generation of
marine invertebrate taxonomists and to improve the
availability of DNA barcode data for expert-identied
marine meiofauna in public databases. The course will
familiarize students with the vast biodiversity of marine
meiofauna through eld and laboratory work and pro-
duce a collection of expert-identied specimens that will
be used for whole-genome amplication for DNA barcod-
ing and other potential future uses such as genomics. We
will take a taxon-survey approach to emphasize practical
skills essential for collection, identication, characteriza-
tion, preservation, and molecular analysis of meiofauna.
Sampling of diverse habitats on Dauphin Island will
provide a wealth of specimens of diverse taxa for our
investigations.
World experts (see website for list of mentors) will give
lectures on their taxa of interest and other areas of ex-
pertise. Morphological laboratory work will emphasize
the preparation of specimens for microscopic examina-
tion and identication to the level possible with light
microscopy. We will not conduct molecular work dur-
ing the course, but students will learn about sampling
and preservation of specimens for molecular techniques
and cutting-edge molecular approaches being applied to
marine meiofauna. In parallel to the course, we will be
conducing sampling for DNA metabarcoding of meio-
fauna communities around Dauphin Island. Participants
will be expected devote signicant eort to collection,identication, and preservation of specimens for molec-
ular work as well as help with compilation of species
lists, images, and metadata that will be released public
databases to broadly benet the community. Partici-
pants will have the opportunity to collect specimens for
their own research.
Due to space constraints, the course is limited to just 10
students. We use the term \student" broadly and will
consider applicants at diverse career stages interested
in studying meiofauna. The course is free, but students
will be responsible for travel expenses. Housing in the
DISL dorms and meals at the DISL cafeteria will be
provided for students.

Online MorphologicalPhylogenetics
Nov28-Dec9
Dear colleagues,
Registration is open for Transmitting Science's course
Morphological phylogenetics: principles, applications,
and techniques. 6th Edition. This course will be held
live online (synchronous). Max 18 participants.
DATES: November 28th - December 9th, 2022
INSTRUCTORS:
Dr. Tiago Sim >1
2es (Harvard University, United States
of America)
Dr. Nicolas Mongiardino Koch (University of California
San Diego, Unites States of America)
COURSE OVERVIEW
An accurate reconstruction of evolutionary relationships
among species is the cornerstone of evolutionary bi-
ology. Building phylogenetic trees thus provides the
fundamental framework upon which systematic, biogeo-
graphic and evolutionary research operates. Morpholog-
ical phylogenetics provides a unique toolkit for inferring
relationships, considering that the vast majority of the
species that have ever lived are now extinct and can only
be assessed based on morphological data. Additionally,
combining fossils and morphological data with molecular
data from extant species is becoming the most compre-
hensive method of assessing phylogenetic relationships
on deep time and the time of origin of major evolution-
ary lineages. In this course, we will focus on the analysis
of morphological data (and combining morphological
data with molecular data) using multiple optimality cri-
teria for phylogenetic inference. We will discuss the best
available approaches to construct morphological data
sets and their impact on phylogenies. We will follow
with theory and hands-on practice of phylogenetic pro-
grams using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood
and Bayesian inference. Participants will learn how to
combine morphological and molecular data for total ev-
idence analyses, how to conduct time-calibrations using
tip and node dating, dierent birth-death models, mor-
phological clocks and combined evidence relaxed clock
analyses. Customized course materials will be provided.
Software: Mesquite, TNT, RAxML, IQTree, Mr. Bayes
and BEAST.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
