CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT
The 2017 ASAB Winter meeting (Thursday 7th and
Friday 8th December 2017):
Sexual selection: do we still need to test the alterna-
tives?
Organised by Professor Nina Wedell and Dr David
Shuker
ABSTRACT SUBMISSION NOW OPEN
The 30 years since the publication of Bradbury and
Andersson's landmark \Sexual selection: testing the
alternatives" has seen a wealth of new empirical data on
the mechanisms and patterns of sexual selection, along-
side major theoretical advances. However, some key
concerns remain, including what drives the evolution of
mate choice and how sexual selection and natural selec-
tion interact. Moreover, the very denition of sexual
selection remains contested. In this meeting, we will
explore the latest ndings in sexual selection, in terms
of both theory and experiment, to chart our progress
in understanding this most beguiling of evolutionarymechanisms, and to map the way forward for the next
generation of sexual selection researchers.
Our invited speakers are Suzanne Alonzo, David Hosken,
and Hope Klug, and we are also delighted that Chris-
tine Nicol will be presenting the 2017 Tinbergen Lecture
during the meeting. We invite spoken and poster pre-
sentations encompassing the widest range of current
work on sexual selection. Please note that due to space
constraints, poster space will unfortunately be limited.
The meeting will be held at the Zoological Society of
London, Huxley Lecture Theatre, London Zoo. As is
traditional for the ASAB winter meeting, there is no
registration and delegates need to organise their own
accommodation and main meals. Tea and coee will
be provided both days, along with a wine reception on
the evening of the 7th. We welcome those wishing to
indicate their likely attendance however, and we are very
pleased to announce that abstract submissions for spo-
ken and poster presentations is now open (deadline 1st
October 2017). An abstract submission form is available
on our website: http://asabwinter2017.weebly.com/ and
only submissions using this form will be accepted. Pre-
sentations will be chosen blind to author(s) and host
institution(s).

asabwinter2017.weebly.com/) or contact us on our dedi-
cated conference email: asab2017@st-andrews.ac.ukSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 3

Asilomar AmNaturalist Jan5-9
Come celebrate 150 years of The American Naturalist!
The American Society of Naturalists is celebrating the
150th anniversary of the founding of The American Nat-
uralist with a conference at the Asilomar Conference
Center on the Pacic coast on 5-9 January 2018. Please
visit http://amnat150.org . Registration will open on
Tuesday, 1 August 2017. Because of the venue size, we
can only accept 200 registrants for the conference, so
don't delay. Submission of titles and abstracts for talks
and posters must be made at the time of registration,
so please have that information ready when you go to
the registration webpage.
The American Society of Naturalists strives to advance
knowledge of unifying biological principles by uncover-
ing processes that generate and maintain patterns of
biological diversity. These patterns and processes nec-
essarily involve complex interactions between ecology,
evolution, genetics, behavior, and physiology. Conse-
quently, ASN emphasizes the value of interdisciplinary
research and collaborations between diverse biologists
to achieve conceptual unication across the biological
sciences. This meeting will bring together a diverse
array of biologists who might not normally encounter
one another at separate discipline-specic meetings.
Come celebrate 150 years of The American Naturalist
with us!

19th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
Friday, 1 December 2017, 9:30 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre,
Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists' Forum represents anexciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE.
Send applications by e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com , supply-
ing your name, contact address and stating whether
or not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English and
in Word format no later than Friday 3 November 2017.
The body text should not exceed 150 words in length.
Title, authors, and their professional aliations should
be included with the abstracts. If the presentation is co-
authored, the actual speaker (oral) or presenter (poster)
must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

First Annual Wildlife Trade Symposium: Evolving per-
spectives on demand for illegal wildlife products
This three-day event is being organised by the Oxford
Martin Programme on the Illegal Wildlife Trade and
co-hosted with generous support from San Diego Zoo
Global and TRAFFIC. The rst day of the Sympo-
sium, September 25th will set the scene for subsequent
days, showcasing a series of invited presentations, panel
discussions and an open poster session themed on:
Diverse approaches to illegal wildlife trade research
Linking the supply and demand for wildlife products
Changing wildlife consumption onto a legal, sustainable
path
September 26th & 27th will consist of in-depth inter-
active sessions covering a range of methodological and
conceptual challenges of the illegal wildlife trade more
broadly. Delegates will have the opportunity to select
and register in advance for sessions in which they wish
to participate, customising their schedule for both days.
Sessions will be conrmed closer to the date and sign-up
will be on a rst-come rst-served basis.
September 26th will feature an evening debate on the
Illegal Wildlife Trade chaired by BBC journalist John
Simpson.

TITLE: Predator-Prey Interactions Gordon Conference:
Registration now open BODY:
Third Gordon Research Conference on Predator-Prey
Interactions
January 28 - February 2, 2018, Ventura, California
http://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=16781 2018
Theme:\Scaling Across Space and Time"
Gordon Research Conferences are recognized as the
\world's premier scientic conferences", where leading
investigators from around the globe meet biennially
for a full week of intense discussion of the frontier re-
search in their eld. We have an outstanding list of
conrmed speakers and contributors (below). Our meet-
ing is capped at 200 people, and lling up fast; so please
register soon!
The neurobiology of responses to risk in individual prey
can, when aggregated across a population, profoundly
aect surrounding ecosystems. Similarly, researchers
are increasingly aware of how quickly selection and epi-
genetic forces can shift prey phenotypes and alter future
interactions with predators. In both cases, the connec-
tions between small-scale (within an individual or at
a single point in time) and large-scale (across ecosys-
tems or generations) processes illustrate how exploring
the 'linkage map' of predator-prey interactions across
scales can identify new elds of research and synergize
the collaborations necessary to address them. We have
targeted the most exciting advances in predator-prey
work across multiple elds, with each speaker agreeing
to share their latest unpublished ndings. In order to
encourage active participation from everyone at the con-
ference, all attendees are strongly encouraged to present
a poster on their work.
The complete program is available, along with further
details concerning registration, at our website (http://-

AlpinePlantPhenotypicPlasticity
PhD positions in alpine plant evolutionary ecology
We are seeking highly-motivated PhD students for
projects on the evolutionary ecology of Australian alpine
plants, based at the Research School of Biology in the
Australian National University. The projects will suit
students with interest and knowledge in plant evolution-
ary ecology, environmental physiology and/or ecological
and evolutionary genetics.
Project descriptions: 1. The epigenetic and ecophysio-
logical basis of plasticity in an Australian alpine herb
in response to warming. Phenotypic plasticity, or the
ability to change phenotype with environment, is the
most important process determining the immediate re-
sponse of natural populations to environmental change,
and yet our mechanistic understanding of the process is
limited. Using large-scale temperature-manipulation ex-
periments an Australian alpine herb, the waxy bluebell
(Wahlenbergia ceracea), these PhD projects will identify
the (epi)genomic and ecophysiological mechanisms driv-
ing phenotypic plasticity in a range of phenotypic traits
in response to temperature. Supervisors Prof Adrienne
Nicotra (ANU), Prof Loeske Kruuk (ANU) and A. Prof
Christina Richards (Uni South Florida, USA).
2. The adaptive potential of woody plants in the Aus-
tralian Alps How do shrubs disperse and spread across
the landscape and how is this reected in their evolu-
tionary genetic history? These projects combine cutting
edge population genomic and classic plant ecology ap-
proaches and to assess patterns of genetic structure in
several key alpine shrub species and assess how these
patterns reect underlying ecological processes. Projects
will make use of next generation sequencing techniques
and bioinformatics in the Genome Discovery Unit at
the Biomolecular Resources Facility (ANU), as well as
eldwork in Australia's Snowy Mountains, Kosciusko
National Park. Supervisors: Dr Susanna Venn & Prof
Adrienne Nicotra (ANU) and Prof Ary Homann (Univ
Melbourne).
Suitable applicants need to be highly motivated with
strong academic and research backgrounds; some back-
ground in plant evolutionary ecology, environmental
physiology and/or ecological and evolutionary genetis
is required. Demonstrated ability to conduct eldwork
and independent research experience are highly desir-
able. Interested students must apply for admission and
scholarship online at the Australian National University.Successful applicants will receive scholarship stipend, tu-
ition fee waiver, and research funds including computer
and travel grants.
Location: We're based in the Division of Ecology &
Evolution in the Research School of Biology, Australian
National University, Canberra, Australia. The facilities
and intellectual environment are outstanding and the
Nicotra and Kruuk labs are lively, hard-working and in-
quisitive places. We strive to do excellent, fundamental
research that is relevant in the context of rapid global
change.
Application deadline: Applications for international stu-
dents are due by August 31 and for Australian citizens
and permanent residents or New Zealand citizens are
due October 31, for an early 2018 start.
To apply, please contact Adrienne.Nicotra@anu.edu.au
or Loeske.Kruuk@anu.edu.au, including a CV, a brief
letter outlining your research interests, and details of
two academic referees. For further information on

AustralianNatlU InsectGenomes
A molecular view of Australian biodiversity - exploring
insect genomes for major shifts in functional genes
Use CSIRO's collection resources in combination with
DNA barcodes, Whole Genome Shotgun sequences and
600 recently sequenced transcriptomes to build the tree
of life for selected Australian insect groups, exploring
genomes for functional genes within this evolutionary
context.
With over 1 million named and many more undescribed
species, insects provide more than 80% of the biodiver-
sity of life on earth. Insects have adapted to almost
every terrestrial habitat on the planet, which is reected
by their vast morphological diversity. Far less well stud-
ied, yet even greater and crucial for adaptation, is their
diversity at the molecular level.
New DNA sequence data are generated worldwide at
an unprecedented scale, and exploring their diversity12 EvolDir September 1, 2017
in the context of an evolutionary framework could help
answer many important questions: - How did the great
diversity of insects evolve in Australia? - Are shifts in
insect biology correlated with major changes in genomes,
e.g., changes from host specialists to generalists with
the expansion of gene families? - Can we use genomic
information to predict the potential of a species to de-
velop into a pest? - How many new species are probably
hidden in our collection and still await discovery?
The Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC) is
home to 12 million specimens and is the by far largest
repository of Australia's biodiversity. As part of
CSIRO's Environomics Future Science Platform, the
ANIC has started to generate low coverage whole genome
sequence data for selected groups for the purpose of
species identication and discovery. This will be feasi-
ble in a high-throughput fashion due to robotics and
cutting-edge technology like Acoustic Liquid Handling
in our lab.
You will be part of a collaborative team at CSIRO
and ANU (Research School of Biology) and have access
to our lab infrastructure, supercomputers, collection
and molecular data, which will include unpublished low
coverage whole genome shotgun (WGS) data for sev-
eral thousand species, unpublished transcriptomes of
600 species and published data (e.g. 1,000 transcrip-
tomes of 1KITE). By combining and analysing these
data phylogenetically, you will reconstruct branches of
the Australian 'Tree of Life'. Based on this tree, you
will have the opportunity to explore transcriptomes and
genomes for major changes in functional genes. To fol-
low promising leads, you will also generate your own
genome and transcriptome data as needed.

The summary and objectives of the project
Posthitis (necrotic inamation of the prepuce) is a se-
vere disease of the European bison, which aects approx.
6 % of males a year. The disease is incurable and the
aected animals are usually eliminated or otherwise
the disease leads to penis autoamputation and death.
The etiology of posthitis is unknown but recent studies
on European bison using cattle tools indicated signif-
icant associations between certain cattle markers and
the occurence of the disease. A study by Ole ~A"ski et al.
(2015) has shown the existence of genetic background of
posthitis in the European bison but the cross - species
character of their study did not allow to either indicate
the genes and their variants involved in the disease or
explain the mechanism if its inheritance.
Sequence - Based Genotyping (SBG) technique will al-
low to achieve an extensive amount of species-specic
data from the whole genome. European bison specic
markers will undergo genome wide association analysis
(GWAS) to identify markers, regions of chromosomes
and genes and their variants aecting susceptibility bi-
son on posthitis. The results will enable to design simple
genetic tests of the 20 - 30 most informative SNP mark-
ers detected. These tests will allow rapid and reliable14 EvolDir September 1, 2017
genotyping of bison susceptibility to posthitis and the
carriers of unfavourable genetic variants.
The aims of the project are:
1. identication of the species specic SNPs (single
nucleotide polymorphisms markers) associated with pos-
tithis in the European bison
2. indication the genes and their variants, underlying
the development of posthitis in the European bison,
3. developing the model of the disease inheritance,
4. verication of the potential role of the Y chromosome
in the pathogenic process,
5.designing informative and cost-eective SNP -chip
based genetic test that allows verication of suscep-
tibility to posthitis as well as carriers of unfavorable
variants
We provide:
1. participation in an interesting scientic project;
2. work in a friendly research team, in a well-equipped
and organized biological laboratory with a support and
supervision of competent colleagues;
3. the possibility of eective scientic development
through cooperation with the best world research cen-
tres in the world;
4. possibility of extension the scholarship for subsequent
2 years;

Fully funded PhD position in evolutionary genomics
is available to join the ERC 'GENECLOCKS' project
(http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/207593 en.html)
headed by Gergely Szollosi (http://ssolo.web.elte.hu) .
The positions is oered for 3 years with the possibility
of extension of one year. The position comes with a
salary of EUR 15,000 per year, as well as a travel and
research funds.
We are looking for an individual who is highly motivated
and is exited by the possibility of pursuing a PhD in
Evolutionary Biology with a strong quantitative focus.
A M.Sc. providing a strong quantitative background,
such as physics, mathematics or computer science, is
essential as well as experience with data analysis (e.g.
in R) and/or computer programming.
A central theme of GENECLOCKS is disclosing new
sources of information for dating the rst three-quarters
of Earth's evolutionary history that are independent
from both fossils and molecular clocks. Life's early his-
tory has remained terra incognita until now, because
the fossils needed to calibrate standard evolutionary
timescales are simply not available for microbial life.
Microbial fossils are scarce and dicult to interpret in a
phylogenetic context with condence. In previous work
we have shown that patterns of lateral gene transfer
inferred from modern genomes encode a record of co-
existing lineages throughout the history of life, and that
we can use this record to reconstruct the relative ages
of microbial groups from the three domains of life in
deep time.
This discovery is a game changer for anyone interested
in the history of life, from either a geological or genomic
perspective. It demonstrates the existence of a new
and abundant source of dating information that is in-
scribed in the genome of any organism, provided a gene
transfer occurred in its ancestry. This constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the diversity of life.
The PhD student will develop with, and undertake a
project under the supervision of Dr. Gergely Szollosi
and will have to possibility to work together with and
visit international collaborators (in Lyon, Bristol andSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 15
the KTH in Stockholm).
To be considered, please send a single merged PDF to
ssolo@elte.hu that contains your CV including, academic
transcripts, a statement of research interests (3 pages or
less) as well as three academic references. Please include
'GENECLOCKS PHD' in the subject of your email.
The GENECLOCKS research group is lead by
Dr. Gergely Szollosi (https://scholar.google.hu/-
citations?user=3DsPrYT-oAAAAJ) and is hosted at
Eotvos Universities Institute of Physics in Budapest.
The Institute of Physics has been included in the Excel-
lence Group of European Universities, and has achieved
top placement in the number of citations, the number
of ERC grants, the time available for PhD research and
the gender balance of master's students in the CHE

Work plan:
The project investigates the ecological and evolutionary
processes involved in shaping the Mediterranean Basin
as one of the world's richest biodiversity hotspots, us-
ing amphibians and reptiles as a model system. This
will be done by combining phenotypic data to phyloge-
netic hypotheses about each group of interest to test
hypotheses on the evolutionary processes driving diver-
sication of circum-Mediterranean herp taxa. The work
of the fellowship holder will be to infer phylogenies for
various groups of amphibians and reptiles based on pub-
lished sequence data. For this purpose, the grant holder
will need to conduct a bibliographic search on available
publications, access public databases to download the
necessary data, and conduct all analyses of phylogenetic
inference. The grant-holder must be available for trav-
elling to the MNCN, Madrid, Spain, in order to discuss
the analyses with a member of the project team (Dr.
Mart ~Ane-Solano).

FUBerlin EcoEvoInsectImmunity
Freie Universit at Berlin, Institute of Biology
2 PhD positions: eco-evo-immunology of Drosophila
bacteria interactionsApplication deadline: 18th September 2017
Applications are invited for 2 PhD positions at the
Freie Universit at (FU) Berlin, Institute of Biology. The
positions are funded by the German Research Founda-
tion (DFG). The principle investigator is Dr. Sophie
Armitage (https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/-
animalevolecol/armitage.shtml), who will start a DFG
Heisenberg Fellowship at the FU on the 1st October
2017. The PhD positions will start on the 1st December
2017, or as soon as possible thereafter. The group will
collaborate with the evolutionary biology group of Prof.
Jens Rol (http://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/biologie/-
arbeitsgruppen/zoologie/ag rol/index.html). The
projects are for three years each and the salary is accord-
ing to the scale for public servants (TV-L E13/65%).
The working language of the group is English.
Project background: Our research lies in the eld of
eco-evo-immunology, with a focus on host resistance
and tolerance. Pathogens can have substantial negative
tness eects on their hosts. This creates a strong selec-
tion pressure on a host to have ecient immune defences.
A host can counteract an infection by directly reducing
its pathogen load, i.e., resistance, or by reducing the
harm that the infection does to its tness, i.e., tolerance.
Given that resistance can be costly and involve autoim-
mune damage, a more resistant host is not always the
ttest. Tolerance is therefore an interesting concept be-
cause it describes how well hosts are able to ameliorate
the tness costs of a given pathogen load. Resistance
and tolerance are predicted to give contrasting perspec-
tives on host-pathogen evolution and infectious diseases,
therefore it is important to understand infection in the
light of these two concepts.
The rst PhD project will utilise experimental evolution
to understand more about the evolution of resistance
and tolerance strategies. Previous pathogen experience,
so-called priming in invertebrates, can increase host sur-
vival when it is subsequently infected with the same
pathogen, and is likely to be a signicant route to im-
mune defence. The second PhD project will thereby ask
how previous pathogen experience aects tolerance and
resistance.
Drosophila melanogaster will be used as the host, and
dierent bacterial species will be used as pathogens.
The projects will include tness and resistance assays as
well as molecular work (depending upon the project).
Requirements: Master's degree in biology, evolutionary
biology or related elds.
Desirable: We would like applications from enthusiastic
and highly motivated students with a background / in-
terest in evolutionary ecology. The candidates shouldSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 17
have good communication skills and be happy to work
independently as well as in a team, and be able to write
prociently in English. Knowledge of statistics would
be a plus.

IGB Berlin FunctionalGenomics
PhD position in Functional genomics for aquaculture -
growth, sex determination and disease resistance
at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and In-
land Fisheries (www.igb-berlin.de)
Since 1996, the IGB has been committed to research
on sturgeon aquaculture, remediation and restoration,
including several national and international projects and
programmes.
Within EU ERA-Net, the COFASP project STURGEo-
NOMICS involves France, Romania, and Germany (here
subject to nal approval of the Federal Oce for Agri-culture and Food, BLE).
At the IGB, the Research Group Applied Fish Physiol-
ogy and Aquaculture, led by Dr. Sven Wurtz, is looking
for a hard-working, enthusiastic
PhD student: Functional genomics for aquaculture -
growth, sex determination and disease resistance, from
now on for a 3 year period
Within STURGEoNOMICS, whole genome-based ap-
proaches will be explored to improve sturgeon aqua-
culture, working on two species of sturgeon. The PhD
candidate will experimentally extract candidate genes re-
lated to target traits (growth, disease resistance, sex de-
termination) for an optimization of management strate-
gies as well as breeding. During the project the candi-
date will be able to work collaboratively on high quality
genome information and transcriptomics to determine
the genetic basis of variability in disease resistance and
growth during early development as well as sex deter-
mination and early sex dierentiation. This work is
an essential prerequisite for future selective breeding in
order to improve rearing in aquaculture (aiming at max-
imized growth and disease resistance, as well as early
determination of sex and subsequent selection of females
for caviar production). The candidate will spend up to 6
months in the facilities of the other partners, which will
enhance multidisciplinary training of the student, and
give him/her important experience of both academic
and non-academic sectors (sturgeon farming).
Applicants should have a 2.1 degree or equivalent in a
relevant life science (bioinformatics, molecular biology,
sheries sciences, aquaculture). Excellent communica-
tion skills in English are required. Experience with
molecular techniques (e.g. genome and transcriptome
analysis, next generation sequencing) and sh rearing
is highly preferred. Candidates with a background in
aquaculture will be deemed highly competitive.
Salary will be according to TVoD (50%). In keeping
with the IGB's policy regarding gender equity, female
applicants are particularly encouraged. Among can-
didates of equal aptitude and qualications, a person
with disabilities will be given preference. This posi-
tion is subject to approval of the responsible funding
body (Federal Oce for Agriculture and Food, BLE).
Review of applications meeting the required standards
will start immediately and continue until a candidate is
appointed.
Please send your application and further inquiries
to work leader Dr. Sven Wurtz (wuertz@igb-

herbivorous capability
(a part of NCN OPUS project Experimental evolution
of physiological and behavioral adaptations in the bank
vole: molecular background and alimentary system bac-

Task descriptionSymbiotic evolution played an important role at all
stages of evolution of diverse life strategies. Accord-
ing to the \hologenome" concept, natural selection acts
on the holobiont (host and associated microbes) rather
than on animals alone. A unique opportunity to test
the concept is oered by our articial selection experi-
ment on bank voles (Myodes glareolus). We observed
that voles from lines selected for improved \herbivorous
capability" had an altered composition of gut bacte-
rial symbionts, even if the particular individuals had
no contact with the special diet. We ask whether a)
the dierence in gut bacteria composition occurred in
response to the short change of diet in parents, and
was merely transmitted to ospring or b) the selected
voles evolved genetically-based modications allowing
preferable hosting a modied bacterial community. The
project consists of two main stages: 1) experiments on
the voles (manipulation of diet, cross-fostering, measur-
ing physiological traits and the size of internal organs,
and collecting gut contents samples), and 2) molecular
analyses of bacterial DNA in the samples, leading to
description of the bacterial community and statistical
analyses of its composition.

AvianCulturalEvolutionEcol
We are seeking two PhD students to join an exciting
new research group studying the ecology and evolution
of animal culture (supervisor. Dr Lucy Aplin), based at
the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, in Radolfzell,
Germany. The PhD positions are 3.5 years fully funded
with a competitive stipend, and open for applicants
from any nationality.Background:
Traditional views of Darwinian evolution focus on se-
lection acting on genetically underpinned variation as
a means of adaptation. However this may neglect the
potential contribution of the over-generation transmis-
sion of information (cultural inheritance) as a source of
locally adaptive behaviour - this might be particularly
important in long-lived species and when facing novel
or changing environments. For example, the capacity
for innovation, social learning and cultural inheritance
is thought to be vitally important in the success of hu-
mans as a species, facilitating our colonization of almost
every terrestrial habitat on Earth. But has the cultural
transmission and inheritance of behaviour been simi-
larly important in the success of some other species?
We investigate these questions using a combination of
laboratory experiments and eld studies in birds, uti-
lizing state-of-the-art automated tracking technologies
and analytical techniques.
Project 1: \Laboratory Experiments of Cultural Evolu-
tion"
How are the emergence, establishment and persistence
of cultural behaviours inuenced by social and envi-
ronmental conditions? Can culture evolve over time,
and if so, is this process 'Darwinian'? We will test the
link between cognition, social structure and emergent
cultural phenomenon in large-scale laboratory experi-
ments similar to 'experimental evolution' studies, with
the longitudinal observation of groups of captive birds in
a large aviary complex on site. The project will involve
some local eldwork with wild tits (Parus major), as
well as captive work with small parrots.
Project 2: \Cultural Ecology in Urban Parrots"
Can social learning and the cultural inheritance of in-
formation be a source of behavioural exibility to novel
environments? This project will investigate this question
in sulphur-crested cockatoos, Cacatua galerita. Sulphur-
crested cockatoos have repeatedly colonized urban ar-
eas, both within their native range and as an invasive
species. They are also highly social and relatively long-
lived, with an extensive repertoire of vocalizations and
foraging behaviours. In this project, our group will use
a combination of citizen-science, GPS tracking technolo-
gies, eld observations and experiments to a) describe
the social ecology of this species, 2) test socio-cognitive
mechanisms for urban adaptation, and 3) make within
and between population comparisons in foraging and
vocal behaviours to identify potential cases of 'wild cul-
tures'. This project will involve eldwork in Australia,
and is co-supervised by Dr. John Martin at the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Australia, in collaboration
with the Australian Museum. Position Details: Suit-September 1, 2017 EvolDir 21

to develop projects that explore any one of the following
eco-evolutionary processes.
1) Sexual antagonism and the evolution of health and
tness. Exploring how new mutations arise and inu-
ence dierent aspects of an organism's health. Can
blend together both theory and empirical approaches
to exploring genetic architecture as interests dictate
(together with Tim Connallon at Monash, http://-

2) Energy ux and the spread of disease. The rate at
which organisms use, transform, and expend energy de-
nes not only an organism's \pace of life", but also how
readily that can be exploited by a pathogen. Advances in
high-throughput metabolic assays oer opportunities to
incorporate energy ux into studies of host-pathogen co-
evolution (together with Dustin Marshall and the Centre
for Geometric Biology at Monash, https://cgb.org.au/).
3) Demography and host-pathogen interactions. Pop-
ulations are rarely stable and dierent densities or
growth trajectories can feed back into the spread of
disease within and between patches. Experimental meso-
cosms oer opportunities to explore infectious disease in
light of dierent demographic dynamics (Together with
Ben Phillips at the University of Melbourne, https://-

A stipend (living-allowance) scholarship of ~ $26,288 per
annum is provided tax free (the equivalent of approx.
$33,000 before tax) with no teaching requirements for
3.5 years (the length of a PhD in Australia). We also
oer travel and establishment allowances to help in your
move and our tuition scholarships cover the cost of
tuition fees (normally $38,900 per year). Guaranteed
funding of project costs and research support, including

Museum BonnGermnay 2 Ricesh
There is an exciting opportunity for talented, motivated
and independent applicants to join the Ricesh project
at the Zoological Research Museum Koenig (ZFMK)
in Bonn, Germany. The Project is associated with the
Ichthyology section and the Centre for Molecular Biodi-
versity Research (zmb) of the ZFMK and funded by the
Leibniz Association. The main focus is to connect state
of the art morphological with genomic research to under-
stand complex adaptive traits, here a unique breeding
strategy in Sulawesi Riceshes (Actinopterygii: Adri-
anichthyidae), called pelvic brooding. The study will
integrate state-of-the-art morphological and genomic
methods as well as eldwork in Sulawesi (Indonesia)
and will give applicants the possibility to participate in
each part of the project and gain experience in a young
team of researchers.
In Riceshes from Sulawesi (Indonesia) a new mode of
reproduction evolved at least twice in independent lin-
eages. In pelvic brooding species, females carry the eggs
in an abdominal concavity until they hatch. Studying
pelvic brooding from dierent angles will help to gain a
holistic understanding of the evolution of this adaptiveSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 23
trait. Riceshes are an ideal model to study adaptive
genomics as phenotypic changes can be compared in par-
allel evolutionary lineages and as substantial genomic
resources are available from the closely related model-
organism Oryzias latipes (Medaka). Located at one of
the large German natural history museums, the group
will link the invaluable material of scientic collections
with the new opportunities for advanced evolutionary
biology studies in the age of genomics.
We are seeking highly motivated applicants, ideally
trained in evolutionary biology, and preferably with
a sound background in genetics and/or morphology.
Experience in rearing sh, good laboratory and bioinfor-
matics skills will be considered a plus. One PhD student
will mainly focus on the morphological characterization
of pelvic brooding based on state of the art morphologi-
cal methods, like micro-computed tomography ( ^I1
4-CT),
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) as well as
histology. The second PhD student will mainly focus
on the characterization of candidate genes for traits re-
lated to pelvic brooding via the analysis of tissue related
gene expression and QTL mapping based on RNAseq,
RADseq and whole genome resequencing. Field studies
in Sulawesi (Indonesia) are planned as part of the rst
PhD project but can also be accomplished by the sec-
ond PhD student or both. Projects should complement
each other and tasks can be divided based on personal
interest and expertise. The candidates should be able
to work in a team and should have very good written
and oral communication skills in English.
Salary and benets are according to a public service
position in Germany (TV-L E13, 50%), with payscale
grouping depending on professional experience.
Please submit your application with the usual doc-
uments (letter of interest, CV, complete publication
record, copies of relevant certicates and supporting
documents) to Mrs. Heike Lenz: h.lenz@leibniz-zfmk.de
until 15th September 2017. The positions will remain
open until lled. Questions concerning the position may

Start date: Late 2017
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to be
part of a group to investigate the disease genomics of
the New Zealand snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) and
trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus).
Supervisors Dr. Maren Wellenreuther, Plant and Food
Research (PFR), Nelson, New Zealand Dr. Steve Bird,
Waikato University, New Zealand
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food-production sec-
tor and New Zealand has the potential to develop a range
of locally grown nsh species to meet this increasing
demand. New genomics-based selective breeding pro-
grams are needed to help develop recently domesticated
sh species into premium products. Plant and Food
Research (http://www.plantandfood.co.nz) is known
worldwide for its innovative breeding and genomics re-
search, and it is leading the development of New Zealand
seafood genomics.
This PhD project will involve working alongside a group
of experienced researchers to study the genomes of the
New Zealand snapper and trevally to identify and char-
acterize immune genes, screen for genome-wide disease
markers using a pedigree from domesticated populations,
evaluate the bacterial disease metacommunities and
conduct gene expression analyses using transcriptomics
and qPCR. This will involve using high-throughput
sequencing approaches, coupled with automated and
error-reduced phenotyping. The overall goal is to char-
acterize the immune systems of both sh species to
better understand disease resistance in domesticated
populations, facilitating a rapid and ecient selective
breeding programme.
PhD Project Aims 1. Use whole genome assemblies and
transcriptomes to identify immune genes and pathways,
2. Use genomic information to improve detection of
novel disease QTLs, 3. Assess stress and disease re-
sistance of hatchery individuals, and understand their
bacterial disease communities.
This PhD project will provide an excellent opportunity
to learn the latest interdisciplinary technologies and24 EvolDir September 1, 2017

Abstract: The tawny-bellied cotton rat, Sigmodon ful-
viventer dalquesti, is a poorly understood Texas endemic
that is listed as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need.
S. f. dalquesti is only known from a single opportunistic
sampling 26 years ago; 20 individuals were collected
approximately 18 miles southwest of Fort Davis (Chi-
huahuan Desert Ecoregion; Stangl 1992a). The pop-
ulation was found to be viable, as the 20 individuals
included juveniles as well as reproductively active males
and females. Formal subspecic status of S. f. dalquesti
was based on morphological comparisons to a New Mex-
ican subspecies, S. f. minimus, in which S. f. dalquesti
was found to be craniometrically larger and have dis-
tinct pelage characteristics (Stangl 1992b). Based on
proximity of distribution, it was hypothesized that S.
f. dalquesti is most closely related to S. f. minimus,
yet the single known locality of S. f. dalquesti is about
200 km separated from the eastern edge of the S. f.
minimus distribution. Subsequent phylogenetic work
on the genus Sigmodon included comparison of S. f.
dalquesti to a central Mexico subspecies, S. f. fulviven-
ter, using the full mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene
(Peppers et al. 2002). These subspecies were found
to be a little more than 1% genetically divergent (i.e.
12 base pair dierences across 1140 base pairs). Based
on an accepted mammalian molecular clock, this level
of genetic dierence roughly equates to 100,000 years
of divergence and at least 200,000 generations. Thus,
limited existing data indicate that S. f. dalquesti is a
genetically and morphologically distinct Texas endemic.
However, Bradley and Schmidly (2016) remarked thatthe range and population size of this subspecies remains
unknown, and the above cited publication is the only
known detection of S. f. dalquesti. This perspective, as
well as its state abundance rank of S1, indicate the need
to develop an improved understanding of S. f. dalquesti
biology.
Proposed eld work will help to clarify S. f. dalquesti
occurrence and distribution, and will help inform best
conservation plans for this population. In addition to
eld eorts to more accurately dene S. f. dalquesti dis-
tribution, morphological and phylogenetic analyses will
be used to establish evolutionary relationships among
subspecies. This important missing information will
conrm S. f. dalquesti morphological and genetic ani-
ties, and will explain distinctness of S. f. dalquesti
in comparison to all geographically proximate lineages.
A clear understanding of S. f. dalquesti evolutionary
distinctness is essential to conservation action. For ex-
ample, the presumed rarity of S. f. dalquesti, along
with its apparent genetic and morphological uniqueness,
contrast sharply with the current Global Rank of G5
(i.e. secure- common; widespread and abundant). Work
proposed herein will provide the data necessary to form
an accurate conservation assessment.

Toulouse DemographicInference
Dear colleagues,
we are looking for an ambitious and independent PhD
student to work with us (Olivier Mazet and Lounes
Chikhi) on questions related to the demographic history
of species in a context of genomic data and fragmented
landscapes.
The PhD project is entitled \Global change, fragmenta-
tion and genomics : can we estimate the demographic
history of populations from genomic data in a context
of global environmental change"
The PhD candidate could have either of the following
backgrounds: (i) training in maths/statistical stochastic
modeling and programming, with an interest in ques-
tions related to population genetics, (ii) alternatively,
training in population genetics/biology with a strong
interest and demonstrated experience in scripting, pro-
gramming or modeling. Potential candidates who are
not sure to t any of these two descriptions should
contact us as we are more interested in independent-26 EvolDir September 1, 2017
thinking students than in specic backgrounds.
The PhD candidate will develop theoretical and com-
putational work particularly (but not only) around the
work on the IICR recently introduced by Mazet and
collaborators (see references below). The aim will be to
develop methods to infer complex demographic histories
using genomic data from non model organisms.
The PhD student will be at the Institute of Mathematics
of Toulouse, and based at INSA Toulouse, an engineer
school where Olivier Mazet is a Assistant Professor.
The PhD will be co-supervised by Lounes Chikhi, who
works at the Evolution and Biological Diversity Lab in
Toulouse and at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci^ encia in
Lisbon, Portugal. The candidate will work in close col-
laboration with Willy Rodr guez, a post-doc in Olivier
Mazet's lab, and other members of the team working on
the IICR (Simona Grusea and Didier Pinchon at INSA,
and Simon Boitard, at INRA Toulouse).
Keywords: structured coalescent, Markov processes, sim-
ulation, estimation, inference, demography, fragmenta-
tion, spatial processes, genomics, non model organisms.
Due to funding constraints the PhD contract must start
before the 31st December 2017.

quencing data sets (e.g., RNAseq, RADseq, and others)
for species complexes of European amphibians, such
as newts and salamanders (Triturus, Salamandra) and
frogs (Rana, Discoglossus), and comparatively test the
performance coalescence-based approaches of species
delimitation on this variety of markers. Eventually, the

UHaifa CircadianClockMolEvol
Scholarships for graduate students are now available at
the Tauber research laboratory for *Biological Clocks
*at the University of Haifa, Israel. Research in the lab
focuses on molecular evolution of genes of the circadian
clock: a fascinating system that drives daily rhythms
in physiology, metabolism and behaviour, and is evo-
lutionary conserved. We study *Drosophila,* whose
clock genes are well conserved in humans. We employ a
broad range of techniques, including molecular cloning,
transgenics and imaging, as well as quantitative genetics,
behavioural analysis, and bioinformatics.
In the last few decades, the molecular basis of the clock
has been elucidated. The fruit-y Drosophila has been
a major model system for identifying circadian clock
genes, which are well conserved in human. By inducing
mutagenesis and screening for Drosophila mutants that
show aberrant light response, various proteins were iden-
tied to be involved in light transduction. Our research
focuses on natural genetic variation related to clock
function. We aim at identifying natural variants that
have been evolved in wild populations, serving as molec-
ular adaptations under dierent light and temperature
conditions. We use broad range of techniques, including
molecular cloning, transgenics and gene knockdown as
well as quantitative genetics, behavioural analysis, and
bioinformatics.
Potential Research Projects:
1) Study how natural genetic variations in clock genes
modify the clock function in dierent environments.
2) Study the role of the circadian clock in deylength
measurement (the photoperiodic clock), which is im-
portant for timing seasonal responses (for this area of
research we are also using the Jewel wasp Nasonia as a
model system).
3) Study the genetic basis that underlies preference for
either diurnal or nocturnal activity in animals.

PhD position in biology, Institute of Life and Environ-
mental Sciences, University of Iceland
A full PhD position in biology is open for applications, at
the Institute of Life and Environmental Sciences for the
project: Evolution of reproductive barriers in sympatric
Arctic charr morphs.
How is phenotypic integrity maintained in the face of
gene ow? What is the eect of hybridization on develop-
ment and tness? What are the molecular mechanisms
behind hybrid incompatibilities? These and related ques-
tions will be addressed by a team of researchers, and a
capable PhD student responding to this advertisement.
The project The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) of
Lake Thingvallavatn is ideally suited to address these
questions. The Lake was formed at the end of the last
glacial epoch just 11-10 thousand years ago and despite
its young age it now harbors four morphs of Arctic
charr, whose distinct variation in life history character-
istics, behavior and trophic morphology suggest rapid
adaptive diversication, possibly followed by or caus-
ing build-up of reproductive barriers. The focus of
this project will be on the two smaller Thingvallavatn
morphs, planktivorous- (PL) and small benthic-charr
(SB), which have diverged along the limnetic - benthic
ecological axis, and inhabit dierent parts of the lake.
Breeding populations of both morphs are large and their
spawning overlaps spatially and temporally seemingly
presenting ample opportunities for cross-mating. Yet,
population genetic studies show that they constitute
distinct populations, which suggests eective reproduc-
tive barrier(s). We intend to cast light on the nature of
these barriers. The central hypothesis underlying our
investigation is that reproductive isolation between SB
and PL Arctic charr is partly due to strong negativeselection against hybrid ospring and/or dierences in
the exact timing of spawning (i.e. time of the day),
precise spawning location and/or mating behavior. The
Ph.D. project's aims are to: i) Assess hybrid survival
and tness during embryonic and early larval develop-
ment ii) Study gene expression during development of
hybrid and pure morph crosses iii) Study the spawning
behavior of the two morphs and their interaction in the
wild and in the lab. The applicant must have completed
an M.Sc. degree in Biology or related elds from a
University approved by the University of Iceland's Grad-
uate School. Those with an advanced degree including
at least a 60 ECTS credits thesis project will be given
precedence. Diving experience is a plus.
We are seeking a student with dedication, drive and
good theoretical background in evolution, developmen-
tal and molecular biology and an interest in animal
behavior. The work involves planning and executing
sampling in the eld, acquisition and analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data and numerical analyses,
designing laboratory experiments. The position will
be at the University of Iceland and the work will take
place there. Experts at the University of Aberdeen,
Scotland and the Holar University College, Iceland, will
also participate in the project. Application deadline
is 1st of August 2017. The PhD study should be com-
pleted within four years of full time study. The PhD
student may be involved in teaching, for two semesters
maximum. The selected candidate will have to formally
apply for PhD studies at the University of Iceland in due
time. Applications should be submitted here: https://-
ugla.hi.is/radningar/index.php?sid=2448&starf=192 ac-

the PhD studies and what makes them suitable for this
project ii) CV, iii) transcripts of university diplomas, iv)
courses taken at bachelor and masters level, v) degree
project thesis and vi) names and contact information of
two persons that could provide letters of references.
The student will join the Arctic charr group at the In-
stitute of Life and Environmental Sciences, under the
supervision of Sigurdur S. Snorrason, Arnar Palsson
and Zophonias O. Jonsson. The Arctic charr group
consists of several PhD students and senior person-

UQueensland UExeter
EvolGenomicsNutritionAgeing
A unique joint institution graduate position is available
in the labs of Steve Chenoweth (U Queensland) and
Alastair Wilson (U Exeter). This Exeter-UQ collabo-
rative research project seeks to address fundamental
questions about the causes of ageing in a way that com-
bines both mechanistic and evolutionary factors. It will
take an experimental approach to understanding why
individuals and genders dier in the speed with which
they age.
Specically, the project will dissect relationships be-
tween dietary intake, DNA sequence variation and age-
ing rates. To achieve this, the student will use a powerful
experimental genomic system developed at the Univer-
sity of Queensland in the lab of Steve Chenoweth. A
comprehensive set of genomic resources are now available
for an model insect system that permits experimental
investigations of ageing. These include panels of more
than 100 sequenced living genomes, and a large panel of
matched mutation accumulation lines. This will allow
the student to investigate how new mutations shape
individual ageing trajectories, and critically, determine
whether harmful mutational eects can be oset through
targeted dietary interventions. These genomic tools will
be combined with an evolutionary approach, rooted
in life-history models that give clear and general pre-
dictions about when, why and how senescence should
occur. To test these predictions, genomic and genetic
data will be investigated using modelling and analysis
techniques developed in the group of Alastair Wilson at
the University of Exeter.
This project oers students a rare opportunity to ac-
quire a broad understanding of evolutionary biology
and life-history theory, a well as specic skills in sta-
tistical genetics, bioinformatics and the experimental
techniques used in nutritional research. The student
will divide their time between experimental design, the-
oretical modelling and data analysis at the University
of Exeter (Wilson), and experimental genomic work at
the University of Queensland (Chenoweth).
The award includes a full living allowance, fee waivers,
and a generous annual travel grant permitting frequent
travel between the UK and Australia. The award has
no specic nationality restrictions.Applications close: 11 September 2017 for an anticipated
start in January 2018

UTokyo PlantEvolutionaryEcol
The Sheerson lab at the University of Tokyo is recruit-
ing graduate students at both the MS and PhD levels
with interests in plant evolutionary ecology, for entry
into the Graduate Program in Environmental Sciences
(GPES, online at http://gpes.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in Sept
2018. We specialize in evolutionary demography and
plant/microbial evolution, with particular interests in
rapid evolution and eco-evolutionary dynamics. We are
particularly hoping to recruit students to work on the
following funded research projects:
1) *Deep demography*: Demographic patterns are
strongly inuenced by both evolutionary history and
geography, but a mechanistic understanding of these
relationships is still lacking. We hope to unravel it using
a number of large-scale projects focused on herbaceous
perennial plant species.
2) *Evolutionary origins of plant-microbial symbiosis*:
We seek to understand the rst steps in the evolution-
ary process leading to the development of widespread
symbioses, such as the mycorrhiza.
3) *Eco-evolutionary impacts of individual history*: We
hope to understand how long-term experience inu-
ences evolutionary processes, particularly at the micro-
evolutionary scale.
In addition to these projects, we seek students generally
interested in the following topics:
1) Micro-evolutionary interactions between symbiosis
and population dynamics, with a focus on the mycor-
rhiza.
2) The micro- and macro-evolution of senescence-related
life history patterns and life history costs, with a focus
on herbaceous plants and terrestrial fungi.
3) Interactions between community structure and phy-
logeny at diering timescales, with a focus on the myc-34 EvolDir September 1, 2017
orrhiza.
4) Eco-evolutionary impacts of conservation problems
and associated management.
Students applying to work in the lab may focus on
these topics, or choose other research themes in plant
and microbial evolutionary ecology. Research methods
typically involve *in situ* monitoring and experimenta-
tion, combined with modeling and analysis based in R
and/or C++. We typically work with plants and their
symbiotic microbes, and students should generally be
interested in these study organisms. The Sheerson lab
has active eld sites in the Japan, USA, and Estonia,
and also regularly conducts eld work in China, Central
America, and Western and Central Europe.
The Sheerson lab is located within the University of
Tokyo, Komaba Campus. U Tokyo is home to some of
the nest scientists in Japan, including ecologists and
evolutionary biologists, and more Nobel laureates than
you can shake a stick at. Komaba in particular has a
particularly large community of ecologists and evolu-
tionary biologists working on plants, animals, and fungi.
The GPES program conducts all graduate education
in English, although students have the opportunity to
learn Japanese and take courses from throughout the U
Tokyo curriculum. Our campus is only 15 minutes' walk
from Shibuya, one of the most vibrant parts of Tokyo.
Applications to join the lab MUST be received by *24
November 2017*, and students MUST INCLUDE a cur-
rent, ocial GRE transcript. Please note that GRE
scores are only valid for 5 years, so students with tran-
scripts older than this need to re-take the GRE. Appli-
cants with high scores, high grades, and strong recom-
mendations will be considered for a competitive, full-ride
scholarship.

A PhD contract is available at the laboratory of Rafael
Sanju an (University of Valencia, Spain).
Starting date: end 2017.
Place: recently created Institute for Integrative Systems
Biology (I2SysBio), Valencia, Spain.
Project title: Collective Infectious Units and the Social
Evolution of Viruses.
Funding: ERC Consolidator Grant, 2017-2022.
Goal: understand how multi-virion infectious units de-
termine social-like interactions in viruses (cooperation
versus conict). We will baculoviruses as model systems.
Candidates should have a background in molecular/cell
biology and virology (preferably with baculoviruses).
ERC project summary:
A widely accepted view in virology is that virions func-
tion as independent infectious units. However, recent
work by us and others indicates that viruses are often
transmitted as more complex structures, such as virion
aggregates, lipid vesicles or protein matrices harbour-
ing multiple infectious particles. This demonstrates
that viruses can be transmitted as \collective infectious
units", in contrast with the current paradigm. Criti-
cally, these recent discoveries now set the stage for the
evolution of social interactions, a previously unappre-
ciated facet of viruses. We propose to investigate how
collective infectious units drive virus social evolution
using state-of-the-art tools from the elds of virology,
genetics, structural biology, and nanotechnology. The
eects of collective infectivity on viral tness will be
tested directly using experimental evolution and geneticengineering, and conrmed in vivo. Three widely dier-
ent viruses will be used to achieve generality: human
enteroviruses, a vector-borne rhabdovirus, and a bac-
ulovirus. Furthermore, the implications of virus social
interactions for the maintenance of genetic diversity,
evolvability, virulence evolution, and the emergence of
drug resistance will be investigated. New processes such
as the putative extracellular fusion of viral particles will
be also explored. We expect that infectious units consti-
tuted by viruses from dierent species will be uncovered
as well, with far-reaching implications for epidemiology.
It is becoming increasingly recognized that parasite so-
ciality is a disease determinant, and our results may
therefore inspire new antiviral strategies. Beyond their
practical importance viruses will also provide a simple
and tractable system that will help us to establish more
general principles of social evolution.

UWollongong EvolutionFishSociality
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to join
an on-going research project on the evolution of so-
ciality in coral reef shes, based at the University of
Wollongong, NSW, Australia.
Overview: This is an exciting opportunity to join an
interdisciplinary team of researchers to understand the
causes and consequences of sociality in reef shes. The
project will combine eld experimental investigations
at multiple sites along the Great Barrier Reef with
laboratory genetic analysis based at the University of
Wollongong. Research funding for this project is se-
cured, and we currently seek a motivated and talented
student to undertake this project.
The project supervisors are: University of Wollongong:
Dr. Marian Wong and Prof. Mark Dowton University
of Technology Sydney: Dr. Selma Klanten Project
Outline: Sociality is a common and taxonomically
widespread phenomenon in tropical marine shes. In
spite of this, comparative analyses of sociality to date
have been focused on birds, mammals and insects.
Coral-reef shes are an ideal group with which to
test the generality of hypotheses for social evolution
because: i) they exhibit considerable inter-specic
variation in social organization, ii) species-level
phylogenetic relationships have already been resolved
for some key groups of coral-reef shes, and iii) they
inhabit shallow coral reefs facilitating eld observa-
tions, experiments and collections (for summary see:
https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/6/-
453/226119/Social-Systems-in-Habitat-Specialist-Reef).
As the ecology and life-history of sh dier in major re-
spects to birds, mammals and insects, this comparative
analysis of sociality will likely yield novel and transfor-
mative results that will signicantly advance the eld
of social evolution (see: DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2017.00100).
This PhD project will investigate the causes andconsequences of sociality in one particular group of
coral-reef shes known as \habitat-specialists". These
species reside permanently within discrete patches of
reef habitat, including corals and anemones.
Mentorship: This project is supervised by Dr.
Marian Wong, a behavioural ecologist and Se-
nior Lecturer (http://smah.uow.edu.au/biol/contacts/-
UOW135217.html; http://marianwong.wixsite.com/-

ney (http://www.selmaklanten.com/). The University
of Wollongong oers excellent scholarship, career de-
velopment and supervisory support for post-graduate
students in a friendly and collegiate setting.
Applicant Requirements: The applicant is expected
to have completed a recognised undergraduate degree
in Biological Sciences with an Honours degree (or
equivalent) in marine biology and/or ecology, and
possess a demonstrated interest in animal behaviour.
The successful applicant must also be SCUBA qualied.

Two PhD positions - Evolutionary Ecology of Ambrosia
Beetles
Research Group Insect-Fungus Symbiosis, Zoology 3,
University of W urzburg, Germany
Application deadline: 30.9.2017
Two 3-year PhD positions in \Evolutionary Ecology of
Sociality and Fungiculture in Ambrosia Beetles"
We seek highly motivated biologists with a keen interest
in the ecology and evolution of insect social behaviour
and/or fungiculture to join our newly established re-
search group at the University in Wuerzburg, Germany
(www.insect-fungus.com).
Description: Our main models are bark and ambrosia
beetles (AB), which live in subsocial to eusocial soci-
eties within wood, where they cultivate fungi on walls
of their tunnels. Both sociality and fungiculture evolved
in several independent lineages under dierent ecolog-
ical conditions, levels of relatedness and ploidy. They
remained poorly studied although they are excellent
models to test pending evolutionary questions.
Possible projects: - Is it possible to articially se-
lect for/against sociality in AB? - How is division of
labour regulated in AB societies? - How do AB su-
press pathogens and promote cultivars in their fungus
gardens? - How does AB social evolution aect the
evolution of fungiculture and vice versa? - What are the
factors that repeatedly selected for obligate fungiculture
in AB? In our work we combine eld studies with lab
experiments and apply an interdisciplinary approach,
combining selection experiments, experimental assays,
and culturing methods with state-of-the-art molecular
(e.g. qPCR, next-gen-sequencing) and biochemical (e.g.
GC-MS) techniques.
We require: - MSc degree in (Forest) Entomology, My-
cology, Evolutionary Biology, Chemical Ecology, Micro-
biology, Molecular Biology or Bioinformatics - Due to
the interdisciplinary nature of the projects, successful
candidates must be willing to become acquainted with
methods from the elds above. - Experience working
with insects or microbes. - Prociency in English and
a good team spirit are a must. - Knowledge on ba-
sic molecular methods, statistics (R skills), chemical
ecology and bioinformatics are a plus.We oer: - An exciting research project to build on a
scientic career. - A cooperative and highly ambitious
young research group, as part of a vivid department. -
Opportunities to visit collaborating labs worldwide. -
Salary according to public service positions in Germany
(TVL E13: 65%) for three years. The University of
W urzburg is an equal opportunity employer, i.e. female
scientists are particularly encouraged to apply and dis-
abled applicants will be preferentially considered in case
of equivalent aptitude.
The Host: We are one of a few labs in the
world to study AB. For details on our projects see

Sex chromosome evolution in liverworts
Abstract: Evolution of sex chromosomes is well-studied
in organisms in which sex is expressed in the diploid
phase. In such organisms the lack of recombination and
the asymmetry in haploidy are assumed to lead to the
progressive decay of the Y chromosome. In organisms
in which sex is expressed in the haploid phase both U
and V chromosomes are equally devoid of recombination
and show no asymmetry in recombination suppression.
This provides a unique opportunity to tease apart the
eect of this two factors on the evolutionary trajectory
of sex chromosomes. We are using a combination of38 EvolDir September 1, 2017
classical genetic and comparative genomic approaches
to test hypotheses concerning sex chromosome evolution
in haploid dioecy using liverworts as a suitable model
system (Marchantia polymorpha, Preissia quadrata and
many more).
Job Description: The goal of this project is to (1) de-
velop a new methodology for capturing and sequencing
complete sex chromosomes in plant model systems and
(2) to reconstruct their evolutionary history both at
the gene and structural levels. Therefore, this posi-
tion involves molecular laboratory work to develop and
optimize capturing and sequencing protocols; bioinfor-
matics work to analyze and interpret the generated
next-generation sequencing data; and evolutionary and
functional genetic analysis of the evolution of sex chro-
mosomes in the model plant Marchantia polymorpha
and other liverwort species. This project is aimed at
addressing one of the fundamental questions of evolu-
tionary biology, the genetic makeup of sex chromosomes
in a haploid plant model organism, via developing a new
cutting-edge method for third-generation sequencing.
The successful candidate will have a M.Sc. degree
in plant molecular systematics, plant evolution, plant
molecular biology/genetics as well as strong analyti-
cal skills and excellent skills in plant molecular biology.
Experience in generating, handling, and analysing next-
generation sequencing data including programming skills
in R/Python/Perl is highly recommended. Procient
oral and written English skills are expected.
The successful candidate will be matriculated at Uni-
versity of Zurich and work 18 months at University of
Zurich, Switzerland. The other 18 months at BaseClear,
The Netherlands. Peter Szovenyi, University of Zurich;
Prof. Elena Conti, University of Zurich, Prof. Michael
Lenhard, University of Potsdam; Dr. Walter Pirovano,
Dr. Adalberto Costessi and Dr. Dani el Duijsings, Base-
Clear BV, The Netherlands will jointly supervise the
successful candidate. The fellowship period includes fre-
quent periods of trans-national mobility. The complete
36 months will be under 100% working contracts.
Application documents: 1) Curriculum Vitae with list of
publications (if applicable); 2) transcripts of University
courses with grades and grading scale applied at the
respective degree-granting University; 3) certicate of
language prociency in English (if available); 4) motiva-tion letter explaining why the applicant is suitable for
the position and indicating preferred starting date; maxi-
mum length: one page; 5) two letters of recommendation
sent DIRECTLY to peter.szoevenyi@uzh.ch by each ref-
eree. Send the application documents listed above (1-4)

Caatinga Brazil FieldAssist
MarmosetCommunication
MSc student/ eld assistant: common marmoset com-
munication - Caatinga, Brazil
What:
Which roles did socio-ecological factors play during the
evolution of human language? Which syntactic abil-
ities are present in cooperatively breeding primates?
Non-human primates are capable of combining calls into
sequences but we don't know yet if this also results in
combing call meanings. As marmosets and tamarins live
in cooperatively breeding social systems, probably simi-
lar to ancestral humans, their communicative abilities
are of prime interest. To investigate these questions this
project will examine the complexity of call combinationsand their related contexts and potential functions in
free-living common marmosets, a New World monkey
species.
Work in the eld will consist of focal individual obser-
vations recorded on audio and video, supplemented by
opportunistic recordings, as well as pilot experiments.
For another project on potential within-call variation
linked to hormones we will also collect faecal samples.
Working hours are mainly in the morning (starting early)
and afternoon, with time for a break and computer work
at midday. I am looking for someone to assist me in
the eld and to carry out part of the eld work by
him/herself under my supervision. This could either be
a MSc student who would like to use this opportunity
for an internship (including the preparation of a thesis)
or a eld assistant.
Where: Baracuhy Biological Field Station, Caatinga
area, Brazil (Para ba)
When: Fieldwork October 2017 - January 2018 (4
months), for a MSc student: project start September
2017 (6-7 months in total)
Requirements:
- Motivated MSc student with an interest in vocal com-
munication, primate behavior or syntax studies
- For an assistant: at least a BSc in a relevant eld,
ideally also a MSc or previous eld experience with
habituated animals
- Willingness to work in a semi-arid climate under eld
conditions and to adjust to a dierent culture and
lifestyle
- Fluent in English, German or Dutch, ideally some basic
understanding of Portuguese
Funding/support:
As I am a PhD student and have limited funds, I can-
not oer a proper salary or cover travel costs to Brazil.
However, I am happy to assist in applying for a student
travel grant! I might be able to pay a small salary for
a eld assistant based on the rate of undergraduate
research assistants in Brazil. Travel from Recife to the
eldsite and back might be covered depending on the
travel dates. Lodging will be provided without any costs
(incl gas/water/electricity/limited internet), meals will74 EvolDir September 1, 2017
be self-cooked, grocery shopping costs will be shared.
How to apply:
If you're interested, please send me a CV and a cover

GBS-RADSeq services
Hi
I am searching for the best possible option for genomic
sequencing services, available for an academic research
entity (Mexican University), thus it will be of great help
to get dierent suggestions.
We need to obtain polymorphic SNPs, data that will be
used for population and landscape genomics, annotation
for loci under selection, and the sort.
The GBS or single/double RadSeq service we need in-
cludes library preparation; we will provide the appropri-
ate DNA samples of dierent animal species (initially
rodents). We wish to obtain the raw data (fasta les)
from which to perform the Bioinformatics (no need the
service companies to do it).
I have already contacted these companies: Data2Bio
and Floragenex (they already gave me some quotes);
Genewiz and HudsonAlpha (still waiting to hear from
them); and GenScript and Edinburgh Genomics (do not
provide such services).

GBS-RADSeq services answers
Hi
I truly thank so many people that provided sugges-
tions and information regarding my inquire about
'GBS/RADSeq services companies' (which is at the bot-
tom of this message), it was of enormous help!!!
I have compiled the information in some order, and
included only those companies that I have checked al-
ready or that their web page indicate they perform such
services. Some companies were mentioned that I do
not include here because I know they do not provide
GBS services anymore (Cornell), do only sequencing but
not library construction (Macrogen) or do other kind of
jobs, like Ultra conserved elements (UCEs) (e.g., Rapid
Genomics).
Highly recommended and mentioned by several: a) The
Elshire Group: https://www.elshiregroup.co.nz/ (based
in New Zealand). Rob Elshire invented GBS sensu
stricto (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=-
10.1371/journal.pone.0019379). He and Robyn John-
ston are fantastic to work with, their oer high-quality
services, and their prices are globally competitive.
b) Diversity Arrays Technology: http://-
www.diversityarrays.com (based on Australia but
with partners in other parts). Service provider for the
joint generation of thousands of polymorphic SNPs and
dominant markers for non- model organisms. Their
technique is called DArTSeq. We had very good
experience with them and they can provide results from
SNP tables till raw FASTQs if requested, including
a BLAST/annotation of all markers against various
genomes.
c) SNPSaurus: http://snpsaurus.com costs similar to
Floragenex, on the high ranges
d) Novogene (www.novogene.com), Chinese company,
indicated as cheaper than Floragenex
e) LGC (http://www.lgcgroup.com/services/-
dna-sequencing/genotyping-by-sequencing-
(gbs)/#.WYVtSYHTXqA); indicated as slow inanswering inquires and long project times
Others: f) GenoScreen (in France) https://-
www.genoscreen.fr/en/ g) TexasAMU Genomics http:/-
/www.txgen.tamu.edu; http://genomics.tamucc.edu h)
Genomix4life (in Italy) http://www.genomix4life.com/-
en/ i) IGATech (in Italy) http://igatechnology.com
j) Center for Anchored Phylogenomics at FSU run
by Emily Moriarty Lemmon and Alan Lemmon
(http://anchoredphylogeny.com). Partnership between
researchers and the Center (from organization of the
project to publication of the study).
k) Genohub: https://genohub.com/ They don't do the
work themselves but rather contact a number of com-
panies which then place bids to do the work you want
them to do. If you accept the low bid, then the com-
pany contacts you and you make arrangements to send
of your DNA. I've used them 3x now and it's always
been cheap, I've got good quality data, and the turn
around was fast.

tionary Life Science) Field work close to Santiago de
Chile, in collaboration with Universidad de Chile
I am looking for a eld assistent with experience bird
catching and handling. Due to an accident, I can not
perform these activities by myself and need help on very
short notice. In september, I will study the incubation
behaviour of the small passerine thorn-tailed rayadito,
Aphrastura spinicauda. This bird breeds in nest boxes
which makes it convenient to study.
The eld assistent would catch the birds with mist nets
during the nest building stage (cautious to prevent aban-
doning), ring them with PIT tags, to follow the incuba-
tion behaviour later on. Another responsibility would
be the measuring and bleeding of the nestlings (mass,
wing length, skull length, etc.).
Travel and housing will be paid for. Successful candi-
dates should have experience in the above mentioned
tasks and should be independent workers. As daily
working hours can be long, the candidate should be
highly motivated and have a hard-working mentality.
Free hours and days depend fully on the bird behaviour
and will be scheduled spontanously.
The candidate would work closely together with me,
a newly started PhD researcher. I am a hard worker
myself, however temporarily limited by my injury. I like
to have a good atmosphere while working and having a
good laugh. The working language in Chile is Spanish.
Spanish skills would be a plus but no obligation.
Interested? Contact me through mlmbirker@gmail.com,
so we can set a Skype meeting for further information.

ProgramInMentoredPeerReview
Dear colleagues, We're now recruiting the rst group
of senior graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and
junior faculty to take part in a pilot peer review train-
ing program: http://www.genetics-gsa.org/careers/-
training program.shtml Peer-reviewers are vital to sci-
ence. Yet early career scientists in genetics rarely receive
formal training in how to be a good reviewer. This un-
even training means we're often failing to prepare the
next generation of reviewers. But it also means many
students and postdocs miss the chance to develop skills
central to their success in science: understanding the
mindset and expectations of peer reviewers and editors,
critical thinking, evaluating research, and providing
constructive feedback on scientic projects not directly
related to their own.
The GENETICS Editorial Board and the GSA Publi-
cations Committee are addressing this deciency with
a program that gives early career GSA members real-
world peer review experience. Participants will receive
training and one-on-one mentoring in peer review from
GENETICS editors, while reviewing manuscripts sub-
mitted to GENETICS that are within their areas of
interest and expertise.
To pilot this program, we invite applications from GSA
members who are senior graduate students and those
within seven years of receiving their PhD degree. Ap-
plicants from anywhere in the world are encouraged to
apply. We particularly welcome applications from mem-
bers who lack opportunities to receive peer review train-
ing in their home labs or departments. For this pilot,
we are seeking applicants able to review manuscripts
for any of the following journal sections: - Cellular
Genetics - Developmental and Behavioral Genetics -
Population and Evolutionary Genetics Applications are
due August 14, 2017: http://www.genetics-gsa.org/-
careers/training program.shtml To learn more about
the development of the program please visit http:/-
/genestogenomes.org/learning-to-peer-review/ Please
help us develop this important program by spreading
the word to your colleagues.

QUBES TeachingEvolution
The QUBES (Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Ed-
ucation and Synthesis) project is announcing two new
opportunities for faculty to learn eective and fun ap-
proaches to teach math and modeling to biology stu-
dents.
These opportunities are Faculty Mentoring Networks, in
which small groups of faculty from around the country
meet online to learn, share, implement, test, and rene
new educational approaches. QUBES Faculty Mentor-
ing Networks provide faculty with \extended duration,
low intensity" mentoring and peer interactions during
the challenging classroom implementation stage of in-
structional reform, not just beforehand in a summer
workshop.
Erin Bodine from Rhodes College is hosting a faculty
mentoring network on using student- friendly (non-
calculus) models in biological applications ranging from
population growth and species interactions to natural
selection and population genetics. The focus will be on
discrete dierence equations and other approachable but
useful mathematical model types. Learn more and apply
here: https://qubeshub.org/gro ups/discretefmn f2017
(Application Deadline September 30).Second, Holly Ga from Old Dominion University is
hosting a faculty mentoring network on using manip-
ulatives and physical models to help learners break
through prior fears and develop an appreciation for how
mathematical reasoning informs problem solving, in-
ference, and precise communication in biology. The
focus will be on hands-on, active learning approaches
to introducing modeling. Learn more and apply here:
https://qubeshub.org/groups/beanbagbiology (Applica-
tion Deadline September 15).
In both cases, participants will earn recognition from
a national educational initiative (i.e. a letter for your
faculty annual report/ line for your CV), and have op-
portunities for professional products to result from their
work (e.g., educational publications or presentations at
biology education conferences). Both networks will fea-
ture lots of biological applications of modeling. Neither
network requires or presumes mathematical or modeling
expertise, and both will provide instructional approaches
suitable for introductory biology or ecology/evolution
courses. High school and community college instructors
are encouraged to apply.
Check out these faculty mentoring opportunities and
other quantitative biology education resources and ideas
at https://qubeshub.org . Best,

Second call for postdocs in evolutionary genomics
and phylogenomics are available to join the ERC
'GENECLOCKS' project (http://cordis.europa.eu/-
project/rcn/207593 en.html) headed by Gergely Szollosi
(http://ssolo.web.elte.hu) . Two positions are oered
for 2 years with the possibility of extension up until
the 2022 end date of the GENECLOCKS project. The
position comes with a salary of up to EUR 43,200 per
year (approx. up to EUR 2,400-2,900 net per month
after taxes), as well as a travel and research funds.
We are looking for an individual who received his or
her PhD preferably within the last six years, who is
highly self-motivated and can work independently on aproject that he or she will help develop in the context
of GENECLOCKS.
A central theme of GENECLOCKS is disclosing new
sources of information for dating the rst three-quarters
of Earth's evolutionary history that are independent
from both fossils and molecular clocks. Life's early his-
tory has remained terra incognita until now, because
the fossils needed to calibrate standard evolutionary
timescales are simply not available for microbial life.
Microbial fossils are scarce and dicult to interpret in a
phylogenetic context with condence. In previous work
we have shown that patterns of lateral gene transfer
inferred from modern genomes encode a record of co-
existing lineages throughout the history of life, and that
we can use this record to reconstruct the relative ages
of microbial groups from the three domains of life in
deep time.
This discovery is a game changer for anyone interested
in the history of life, from either a geological or genomic
perspective. It demonstrates the existence of a new
and abundant source of dating information that is in-
scribed in the genome of any organism, provided a gene
transfer occurred in its ancestry. This constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the diversity of life.
Postdocs will undertake projects together with interna-
tional collaborators with the goal of either i) developing
new methods that systematically extract information on
the pattern and timing of genomic evolution by explain-
ing dierences between gene trees, or ii) apply existing
methods to resolve the timing of microbial evolution and
its relationship to Earth history and answer long stand-
ing questions. Possible collaborations and associated
projects include:
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Bacteria in collab-
oration with Vincent Daubin at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing and implementing bayesian methods for the
species tree aware reconstruction of gene trees with
Nicolas Lartillot at the LBBE in Lyon.
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Eukaryotes includ-
ing their position within Archaea in collaboration with
Tom Williams at the University of Bristol.
Developing and implementing new methods for species
tree reconstruction in the context of hierarchical gene
tree-species tree methods with Jens Lagergren at the
Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm.
Implementing and applying methods to include trans-
fer derived relative age constraints in molecular clock
estimates with Bastien Boussau at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing novel gene tree-species tree reconciliation
methods that model correlated gene histories with EricSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 81
Tannier at LBBE in Lyon.
Research visits of up to several months are foreseen as
part of potential collaborations.
To be considered, please send a single merged PDF to
ssolo@elte.hu that contains your CV including publica-
tion list, preferably with a link to your google scholar
prole, academic transcripts, a statement of research
interests (3 pages or less) as well as three academic
references. Please include 'GENECLOCKS17' in the
subject of your email. Applications will be considered
until October 1st, 2017, or until the position is lled.
The position is available from the fall or winter of 2017.
The research group is lead by Dr. Gergely Szollosi
(https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=3DsPrYT-
oAAAAJ) and is hosted at Eotvos Universities Institute
of Physics in Budapest. The Institute of Physics has

Postdoc position in Evolution of sex chromosomes in
squamate reptiles
One postdoc position is currently open in Department
of Ecology, Charles University, Czech Republic. The
successful candidate will join our current projects on the
study of the evolution of sex chromosomes in squamate
reptiles with molecular and cytogenetic methods.
Project description: The aim of the project is to
examine the evolution of sex chromosomes and their
homology based on gene content in selected lineages of
squamate reptiles (eg. lizards and snakes). Squamate
reptiles possess lineages with either XX/XY, ZZ/ZW
or temperature-dependent sex determination. Despite
the recent advances in the eld, our knowledge about
their sex determination systems and sex chromosome
homology is limited only to few groups of reptiles
(eg. iguanas, advanced snakes), while the majority of
reptilian lineages remain unstudied. The successful
candidate will collaborate with the other team members
and will study the evolution of sex chromosomes in
a multidirectional approach, involving cytogenetics
(eg. FISH, chromosome painting), molecular genetics
(eg. qPCR) and bioinformatics (eg. transcriptomics).
More information about our current research ac-
tivity can be found in the following publications:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27037610
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26702042
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433436
Qualications: The ideal candidate would have a
Ph.D. diploma and proven expertise in cytogenetics.
Experience in phylogenetics, genomics and/or bioin-
formatics would be desirable. Previous experience in
herpetology is not necessary. The applicant should
be scientically motivated, have good communication
skills and demonstrate publication record in reputable
journals. High standard of spoken and written English
is required.
Application: The applicant should send a short let-
ter explaining his/her background and motivation, full
CV and contact information for two references to Dr.
Michail Rovatsos (michail.rovatsos@natur.cuni.cz).
The position could be either short-term (3-6 months)84 EvolDir September 1, 2017
or long-term (2 years) with possibility to expand, as it
is in the framework of two major 3-year long research
grants. Suitable candidates will be interviewed imme-
diately, and preferably the candidate should be able
available to start in September-October 2017. For any
additional information, do not hesitate to write an email

Postdoc position in Amphibian Evolutionary Genomics
(3 years)
A postdoctoral position in amphibian evolutionary

Babik at the Institute of Environmental Sciences,
Jagiellonian University, Krak ow, Poland (http://-
www.molecol.eko.uj.edu.pl/en GB/zespol/pracownicy/-
wieslaw-babik). The position is within the recently
awarded National Science Centre (NCN) grant \Do
antigen-processing genes coevolve with MHC class I
genes in salamanders?"
Background. Understanding the mechanisms driving
evolution of the genes underlying adaptive immunity
is of major scientic importance and has implications
for conservation. In this project we will test whether
Antigen Processing Genes (APG) coevolve with Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I genes in
salamanders. Coevolution has been suggested as the
ancestral vertebrate condition, potentially limiting the
eciency and exibility of adaptive immunity. Selection
pressure to remove this constraint is therefore expected
in multiple evolutionary lineages. Limited information
available for salamanders reveals intriguing patterns of
MHC I and APG variation, making this group ideal
for testing the coevolution hypothesis and providing
fundamental insights into the evolution of the adaptive
immunity.
Job description. The postdoc will test predictions of
the coevolution hypothesis. More specically (s)he will:
i) resequence the focal genes in multiple species from
several families, ii) perform bioinformatics analysis of
resequencing data, iii) test for correlation between APG
and MHC variation iv) look for signatures of adaptive
evolution. (S)he will work together with the PI and
other team members, including a network of interna-
tional collaborators.
Requirements. The suitable candidate will have a PhD
degree obtained not earlier than in 2010 (extensions
for parental leave apply), be uent in English and have88 EvolDir September 1, 2017
strong interest in evolutionary genomics. The candidate
should have Linux/scripting language skills, experience
in bioinformatics analysis of DNA sequence data and
background in population genetics; background in molec-

MaxPlanck Germany
AvianCulturalEvolutionEcol
We invite applications for a postdoctoral position to join
an exciting new research group studying the ecology and
evolution of animal culture, based at the Max Planck
Institute for Ornithology, in Radolfzell, Germany. The
postdoc is available initially for 2 years, but can be
extended contingent on progress, and will start in early
2018.
Background:
Traditional views of Darwinian evolution focus on se-
lection acting on genetically underpinned variation as
a means of adaptation. However this may neglect the
potential contribution of the over-generation transmis-
sion of information (cultural inheritance) as a source of
locally adaptive behaviour - this might be particularly
important in long-lived species and when facing novel
or changing environments. For example, the capacity
for innovation, social learning and cultural inheritance
is thought to be vitally important in the success of hu-
mans as a species, facilitating our colonization of almost
every terrestrial habitat on Earth. But has the cultural
transmission and inheritance of behaviour been simi-
larly important in the success of some other species?
We investigate these questions using a combination of
laboratory experiments and eld studies in birds, uti-
lizing state-of-the-art automated tracking technologies
and analytical techniques.
The postdoctoral researcher will be part of a team work-
ing in two avian systems: rstly laboratory experiments
of cultural evolution will test the link between cogni-
tion, social structure and emergent cultural phenomenon
in captive birds. Secondly, wild eldwork will be con-90 EvolDir September 1, 2017
ducted on urban-living Sulphur-crested cockatoos (Ca-
catua galerita), using a combination of citizen-science,
GPS tracking, eld observation and experiments. This
will test socio-cognitive mechanisms for urban adapta-
tion, and identify the form and patterning of naturally
occurring cultural behaviours. The postdoc will work
alongside graduate students and research assistants to
develop these systems, but will also have the opportu-
nity to focus on a specic area of interest within the
larger project. The position will include opportunities
for laboratory and eld-based work in Radolfzell, and
eldwork in Australia.
Position Details:
Suitable applicants should have should have a PhD in
a related area. Candidates will ideally have experience
either undertaking independent eldwork or running
laboratory experiments, and will have demonstrated an-
alytical skills and evidence of research output. High self-
motivation and the ability to work both in a team and
independently are also important. Finally, applicants
with experience in programming and with prociency
in R are particularly encouraged.
The working language in the group is English, and
candidates should have prociency in both written and
spoken English. No German language skills are required.
We are an inclusive and diverse group, and encourage
applications from women, people with disabilities, and
all under-represented minorities.
Location:
The lab is based at the world-leading Max Planck for
Ornithology (MPIO), in Radolfzell, Germany: http://-
www.orn.mpg.de/3190/Location Radolfzell. The MPIO
is an internationally renowned research institution with
more than 200 employees working in four departments
and across 10 research groups. The postdoc will also
have the opportunity to interact with collaborators at
the University of Konstanz, the Royal Botanic Gardens
Sydney, and the Australian Museum.
Application Process:
Interested applicants should send a short summary
of their research interests, a CV, and the name and
contact details for at least one referee complied in a
single pdf to Dr. Lucy Aplin at laplin@orn.mpg.de.
Applications will be received until 6 October 2017,
with interviews conducted from October-November
2017.The position will ideally start in January 2018,

EvolutionaryGenomics
Computational / Experimental Postdoc Position
The Research Group \Computational Biology and Evo-
lutionary Genomics" at the Max Planck Institute in
Dresden, Germany has a Postdoc opening.
Project description:
The postdoc will utilize numerous sequenced mammalian
genomes to discover the genomic basis of repeatedly
evolved phenotypic dierences. By focusing on natu-
ral phenotypes that resemble human diseases, we aim
at connecting basic evolutionary with translational re-
search to identify novel genes associated with genetic
disorders.
The postdoc will apply and further develop our genomics
methods, and analyze the results by integrating biomed-
ical knowledge and functional genomics data. Promising
candidate genes will be tested experimentally, either by
the Postdoc or in collaboration. The Postdoc will work
closely with other members of the lab and our insti-
tute on the computational and experimental aspects.
Funding is according to the German TV oD scale.
Our group:
We combine computational biology, comparative ge-
nomics and experiment to investigate how nature's fas-
cinating phenotypic diversity evolved and how it is en-
coded in the genome. On the computational side, we
generate high-quality genome alignments, apply compar-
ative methods to discover key dierences in genes and
regulatory elements, and use statistical approaches to
associate genomic to phenotypic dierences. On the ex-
perimental side, we use RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, functional
assays and CRISPR-Cas9 to reveal the molecular func-
tion of genomic regions and to test causality between
genomic and phenotypic dierences.
Our group is located at the Max Planck Institute of
Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) and
we are jointly aliated with the Max Planck Institute
for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPI-PKS), both
in Dresden. Both institutes are highly interactive and
interdisciplinary workplaces, provide an international
atmosphere with English as working language and access
to cutting-edge computational and experimental infras-
tructure and facilities. The MPI-CBG was awarded oneSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 91
of the \Best Places To Work for Postdocs" in 2011.
Requirements:
Applicants with a background in both computational
and biological sciences are encouraged to apply. Appli-
cants with a computational background should have a
strong interest in integrating experiments in their re-
search and a desire to deeply understand the biology
underlying mammalian phenotypes and human disease.
Applicants with a biological background should be ex-
perienced in using text le processing tools in a Linux
shell environment and should have good programming
skills, for example in a scripting language. Excellent
communication skills and a strong publication record
is expected. Previous experience in large-scale genomic
data analysis is an advantage.
How to apply:
If interested, please email - your CV including publica-
tion list and contact information for at least two refer-
ences - a summary of previous research experience (max
1 page) to Michael Hiller (hiller@mpi-cbg.de). Further

PopGenomics
The Meek Lab at Michigan State University is looking
for a highly motivated postdoctoral scholar to study
population and conservation genomics in sh and other
species. The lab uses eld studies and next-generation
sequencing to address fundamental ecological questions
that are directly relevant to the conservation and man-
agement of threatened species. We study biodiversity at
the level of the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome.
Some major questions being addressed in the lab are:
1. What is the genomic basis for thermal tolerance and
local adaptation? We aim to understand if there are
dierences in gene expression patterns among sh from
populations with dierent thermal histories, and if so,
what are the regions of the genome associated with dif-
ferences in phenotypic response to thermal stress. The
information gained from this study will be invaluable for
understanding the molecular basis for local adaptation
and its relation to climate change resiliency planning,
and in designing management actions that sustain im-
periled species into the future.
2. How do human activities aect genetic diversity andlocal adaptation? We are interested in understanding
how anthropogenic forces, such as hatchery propagation,
shery stocking, and habitat alteration, are inuencing
diversity patterns and tness in the wild. This un-
derstanding will allow us to better design propagation
techniques and target habitat restoration activities to
protect the genetic diversity needed for populations to
persist into the future.
3. What controls complex life history patterns?
Salmonids are an excellent model for looking at the
molecular control of life history, due to their variation in
migration timing and propensity to migrate. We are in-
tegrating across genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic
pathways in steelhead and Chinook salmon to under-
stand the molecular basis for this life history diversity.
Please look at our website (meeklab.com) to get a more
complete picture of the work we do. The post-doc will
have the opportunity to work on one or several of the
ongoing projects in the lab, based on interest and t.
There is also potential for developing new projects, based
on the candidate's interests. We are a very interactive
lab and are looking for an excellent scientist, who cares
about conservation, and is a good collaborator. The
Meek lab strives to be a safe space and support diversity
in STEM.
The initial hire is for one year with an additional year
of funding contingent upon satisfactory progress. The
position will be based in the Department of Integrative
Biology at Michigan State University. Start date is
negotiable and position is open until lled.
*Qualications*
Applicants should have a PhD in ecology, evolution, ge-
netics, bioinformatics, or related elds. We are looking
for a creative and talented scientist with a good publica-
tion record and excellent organizational and communi-
cation skills. We are especially interested in candidates
with a strong computational background and previous
experience with next-generation sequencing data anal-
ysis. Experience working in the Unix environment is

The evolution of camouage in stone plants
A postdoc position is available in the Dept. of Botany
and Zoology at Stellenbosch University in South Africa
studying the evolution of camouage in stone plants
(Lithops). While their name reects their striking re-
semblance to stones, the hypothesis of stone-mimicry in
Lithops has not been tested, nor has visual camouage
received much attention in plants generally. The projectSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 97
involves using NGS approaches to build a phylogenetic
hypothesis for the genus, a combination of multispec-
tral image analysis and visual modelling to explore the
visual components of camouage and their evolution
across gravel types, and eld experimentation to mech-
anistically test the tness implications of camouage
phenotypes. The candidate would be involved in all
these aspects of the project. Previous experience with
NGS would be an advantage. The candidate would also
work closely with another postdoc working on crypsis
in stone-mimicking grasshoppers that share the gravel
plain habitats with Lithops, with the ultimate goal of
exploring convergence of camouage phenotypes in these
groups across the mosaic of lag gravel types that charac-
terise the arid parts of southern Africa. The project is a
collaboration between Tommi Nyman (UEF, Finland),
Tony Verboom (Univ. Cape Town) and myself, Allan
Ellis (Stellenbosch Univ.).
Interested candidates can contact me (Prof Allan Ellis
- agellis@sun.ac.za) directly for more information (also
see http://www.biointeractionslab.com/prof.-allan-g.-
ellis.html and http://www.lithopsproject.org/).
A tax-free Fellowship (R200 000 per year) is available
for one year and can be extended for a second year
depending on the candidates progress. The candidate
would be expected to start as soon as possible.
Applications including a motivation letter, a CV and de-
tails of three contactable references should be sent to me
directly at the above email address. Applications will
close on 30 September 2017 or once a suitable candidate

ProteinEvolutionBioinformatics
Postdoc position: long-term trends in protein evolution
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna Masel
(http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at the Uni-
versity of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist des-
tination surrounded on all four sides by mountainous
national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city of
nearly a million people with an attractive climate. The
EEB department was ranked in the top 10 by US News
& World Report.
We recently found that genes of dierent ages encode pro-
teins with dierent computationally predictable struc-
tural properties, forming an extraordinarily long-term
trend. This project will use bioinformatics techniques
to discover whether these long-term trends are really a
consequence of evolution by descent with modication
that continues for long periods of time in a consistent di-
rection. More details of the project, including preprints
of preliminary ndings, are available upon request.
Techniques used may include phylostratigraphy (assign-
ing ages to gene families), ancestral sequence recon-
struction, and porting macroevolutionary techniques
for studying speciation and extinction to the study of
gene duplication and loss. A high level of statistical
sophistication is required throughout.
Excellent computer programming skills are strongly pre-
ferred, ideally with bioinformatics / genomics and statis-
tics experience. Exceptionally strong candidates who
come from a more experimental background within evo-
lutionary biology, and who now wish to retrain as bioin-
formaticians, will also be considered. A background
in evolutionary biology is also strongly preferred, al-
though again, exceptionally strong computational sci-
entists from highly quantitative backgrounds outside
evolutionary biology will also be considered. Statistical
knowledge, and knowledge about protein structure and
folding, are advantages. Start date is negotiable, and
the position is renewable, with funding secured through
July 2020.

behavior of transgenes with gene drive that might be
introduced into natural mosquito populations. The ap-
plication of gene drives for the control of mosquito-borne
diseases, in this case dengue, Yellow Fever and ZIKA,
has been at the center of attention since the development
of the CRISPR/Cas 9 method. This project will deal
with the application of this technology to real mosquito
populations. There is a great deal of uncertainty about
how these systems will behave in nature. This project
aims to provide insights into this problem.

since spread across the state (although its distribution
is very patchy). This mosquito poses a signicant threat
to human health worldwide being the primary vector of
dengue, Yellow Fever, Chikungunya and ZIKA viruses.
The goal of this project focuses on collecting genetic
data (WGS data) describing populations of A. aegypti
in California and that relates to the prediction of how
well-characterized transgenes that include gene drive
will behave if introduced into these populations.
Job Description. We are seeking a person with a strong
background in population genomics, an interest in the
genetics of invasive species and experience in the analy-
sis of whole genome sequencing data. The person lling
this position will have the opportunity to participate in
eld work throughout the state in collaboration with
state-wide mosquito abatement district personnel. Sup-
port is available for two years with the possibility of
extension beyond. This position is available starting

UExeter ArcticConservation
1+1 year postdoctoral research position Context Mer-
cury (Hg) still raises high environmental concerns in the
Arctic.
This toxicant is indeed found in high concentrations
in Arctic marine food webs and these concentrations
might keep on increasing in some Arctic regions under
the eect of global change.
In that context, understanding impacts of Hg on the
Arctic wildlife, and especially on top-predators which
are among the most vulnerable organisms to environ-
mental pollution, is a major objective. Toxic eects of
Hg have been widely investigated, including on Arctic
species. However, in polar seabirds, a very few studies
have assessed long-term population eects of Hg and
almost nothing is known about eects of the parental
mercury contamination on ospring phenotype and sur-
vival prospects. This is unfortunate as chick body con-
dition, growth and ultimately survival will play a role in
the dynamics of these vulnerable populations and their
future distribution around the Arctic.
Telomeres are long repetitive noncoding sequences of
DNA located at the end of linear eukaryotic chromo-
somes. These telomeres inexorably shorten through lifeSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 105
and this rate of shortening can be modulated by envi-
ronmental conditions and exposure to environmental
stressors such as pollutants. A couple of studies recently
demonstrated in Arctic seabirds how telomere dynam-
ics is linked to bird contamination by some persistent
organic pollutants (OCPs and PFASs). Exposure to
stressors is also well known to have transgenerational
eects, with stress levels in the parental line having long-
term negative consequences on ospring health. Recent
studies have shown that these transgenerational eects
might be mediated, at least in part, by telomere attri-
tion. For instance, birds experimentally stressed during
egg production produced chicks with shorter telomeres
than controls. Hg, as a major environmental stressor,
could therefore impact stress and telomere length of
both parents and their chick, with potential subsequent
consequences on chick phenotype and survival.
Position We are seeking for an enthusiastic postdoctoral
researcher to work on a project aiming at understanding
the long-term eects of Hg accumulated by adult Arc-
tic seabirds on the next generation. More specically,
by focusing on a little auk (Alle alle) population from
Greenland, the postdoctoral researcher will in a rst
step study how adult Hg contamination impact their
chick's Hg contamination and ecophysiological condition
(telomere length, oxidative stress, growth, body condi-
tion) and ultimately survival capacity. In a second step,
the role played by adult movements and distribution
during the non-breeding period on Hg concentrations
accumulated by females prior the laying period and
subsequently on chicks will be investigated.
The position will involve some lab work as the postdoc-
toral researcher will be in charge of analyzing telomere
length from little auk blood samples at the CEBC insti-
tute. Oxidative stress data will be provided as well as
ecological data.
Qualications - PhD in evolutionary biology, ecotoxi-
cology or ecophysiology - Experience with lab work -
Knowledge of Arctic marine ecosystems and/or seabird
ecophysiology will be an asset
We oer a 1-year contract starting at the latest on 1

monthly salary is 2500 euros. The postdoctoral re-

Background Nottingham Research Fellowships (NRF)
and Anne McLaren Fellowships (AMF) target outstand-
ing early career researchers across the University.
The aim our competitive fellowship schemes is to at-
tract and retain exceptional early career researchers to
deliver world-leading research. These independent re-
search fellows will be the next generation of outstanding
research leaders, and enable a step change in research
performance.
Our internally funded fellowships include: three years'
salary costs (R&T 4 and 5 - current oers tend to be
at R&T bottom level 5 dependent on experience) up to
25,000 per annum research expenses up to 5,000 per an-
num taxable childcare costs link to permanent academic
appointment (subject to performance and the right to
work in the UK).
The Anne McLaren Fellowship scheme is targeted at
women in STEM subjects, and the Nottingham Research
Fellowship is available across all participating schools.
Enhanced recruitment - recruiting 100 fellows over the
next 5 years The University recognises the value and
contribution of early career researchers in delivering our
ambitious research vision. As such, we will recruit 100
Nottingham and Anne McLaren Research Fellows by
the end of 2020.
This represents a signicant increase on the traditional
recruitment model, which appointed on average eight

UPerpignan France Metabarcoding
*POSITION AVAILABLE * Postdoctoral Research Fel-
lowship Metabarcoding, Trophic ecology
Duration: 24 Months
The post-doctoral position will be based at the CRIOBE
in the core laboratory on the University of Perpignan
Campus (France). Some eld trips are planned in French
Polynesia. The post-doc will work mainly with Vale-
riano Parravicini (EPHE-CRIOBE) and Serge Planes
(CNRS-CRIOBE).
*KEY REQUIREMENTS & QUALIFICATIONS* The
ideal candidate should demonstrate a background in
the employment of metabarcoding from next generationsequencing and experience in the analysis of complex
ecological networks. The candidate will be in charge
of developing analysis of the trophic niche of reef sh
species employing a mixed approach based primarily
on DNA metabarcoding of gut and intestinal contents,
but also on stable isotopes analysis. The overall goal is
to reconstruct the trophic interactions among species
based on the identication of exact food consumption.
Metabarcoding will mix plants (algae) and animals sur-
vey to evaluate the complexity of the diets and introduce
the level of admixture on the species diets. The suc-
cessful candidate will work within the frame of two
larger and already funded projects in collaboration with
several other international leaders in coral reef ecology.
*GLOBAL PROJECT CONTEXT AND OBJEC-
TIVES* Trophic interactions among species provide
the basis of ecological and evolutionary dynamics as
all species have to acquire the resources necessary to
survive and reproduce. These constraints tend to orga-
nize biodiversity into complex food-webs where species
interact directly, via the classic resource-consumer in-
teraction, or indirectly via multiple resource-consumer
interactions linked to one another. Therefore, the topol-
ogy of food-webs determines synergies, competition and
antagonism among species, mediates the eects of ex-
ternal disturbances and is a key property of ecosystems.
However, the empirical characterization of trophic net-
works is generally limited to simplied architectures (e.g.
bi-trophic predator-prey relationships, plant-pollinator
and host-parasite interactions). Detailed information
on food-web architecture for coral reefs relies mainly on
data from the Caribbean, Cuba and simplied Pacic
food-webs. These architectures are based mainly on gut
content analysis, literature or expert opinion and their
level of detail is limited to broad trophic guilds (e.g.
herbivores, detritivores, invertebrate feeders). This raw
resolution impairs our ability to understand the com-
plexity of coral reefs and to evaluate the disturbance
potential to propagate through the interaction network.
The main goal of this project is to combine metabarcod-
ing analysis based on the existing global DNA-barcode
library (cf. BIOCODE project) and stable isotopes
analysis to assess reef shes dietary preferences in the
Insular Pacic.
*HOW TO APPLY* Interested applicants should send
a cover letter, a statement of research goals and a CV
to valeriano.parravicini@gmail.com. Applicants will re-
ceive an e-mail conrming their application has been
received.
*CLOSING DATE* All applications should be submit-
ted by 30 September 2017. However, until the position
is lled, we will continue to accept application materials.
The position aims to start early 2018 at the latest.114 EvolDir September 1, 2017

proaches to answer fundamental questions in evolution-
ary biology, especially those with practical conservation
applications. Some major questions being asked in the
lab are:
§How do humans inuence the evolution of wildlife?
We study the ways in which climate change, habitat
alteration, and introduced diseases impact the distribu-
tion of genetic variation, the rates of gene ow, and the
probability of adaptation.
§What is the genomic basis of rapid adaptation to novel
pathogens? We examine the demographic and environ-
mental constraints to adaptation and whether genomic
architecture of rapid adaptation diers from that of
more gradual adaptation (e.g., to climate).
Please visit the lab website for more details on current
projects: www.cassinsackett.com The postdoc will be
involved in a project that uses genomic approaches to
analyze genetic diversity in prairie dogs and investigate

Madison.
This project focuses on Rapid Evolutionary Responses
to Global Change using the copepod Eurytemora anis
as a model system. With changes in global climate, the
coastal oceans and estuaries at high latitudes are expe-
riencing rising temperature along with rapid declines
in salinity, due to increases in ice melt and precipita-

function, gene expression, and population genomic sig-
natures of selection associated with changes in salinity.
This postdoc project will entail conducting population
genomic analyses along temperature and salinity gra-
dients in the wild, and during selection experiments in
the laboratory.
A key advantage of the E. anis system is its short
generation time (20d), ease of culturing large numbers
(thousands per population), and ability to generate in-
bred lines. We have a full genome sequence of E.
anis and several reference transcriptome sequences.
Additionally, the multiple independently-derived envi-

PlantVirologyBioinformatics
Postdoctoral Position to Explore the Expanding Field
of Plant Virology
Scientic context Sequencing and assembling the
genomes of eukaryotes can help elucidating the evo-
lution of viruses. Indeed, genomes of plants, animals
and protists can contain viral sequences that have been
inserted either by active or by passive integration mech-
anisms and in many cases retained there over extended
periods of time, sometimes millions of years. The study
of endogenous viral elements (EVEs), coined \paleovi-
rology", does allow the evolution of viruses to be traced,
much like a fossil record (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis,
2015). For example, the study of endogenous retro-
viruses has enabled to uncover their hidden diversity
and host range, and has provided evidence that retro-
viruses have a marine origin, and that they developed
in parallel with their vertebrate hosts more than 450
million years ago (Hayward et al., 2013) (Hayward et
al., 2015) (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis, 2017). The
Caulimoviridae is one of the ve families of reverse-
transcribing viruses or virus-like retrotransposons that
occur in eukaryotes (Pringle, 1998), and is the only
family of viruses with a double-stranded DNA genome118 EvolDir September 1, 2017
that infects plants. Unlike retroviruses, Caulimoviri-
dae do not integrate their DNA in the genome of their
host to complete their replication cycle. Nevertheless,
caulimovirid DNA can occasionally integrate their host
genome passively. Using paleovirology approaches, we
have determined that EVEs from several Caulimoviridae
genera are found in virtually all vascular plant genomes,
including ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms, often
at high copy number (Geering et al., 2014) (Diop et al.,
2017). A major conclusion stemming out from previous
work is that, instead of representing a single element,
endogenous Caulimoviridae often appear to dene com-
plex networks of related sequences with structural and
genetic variants. For instance, Caulimoviridae EVEs
can be re-organized in plant genomes into sequences
capable to generate episomal infection (Gayral et al.,
2008). In addition, several Caulimoviridae genera have
bipartite genomes (Geering et al., 2014) - each viral
genome is dened by two \chromosomes" - but it is
unclear whether this genomic organization has emerged
once or repeatedly. Furthermore, in the oak genome,
we found a very high number of short Caulimoviridae
segments with movement protein domain relative to
the number of full length viral genomes (Plomion et
al., submitted), suggesting that they represent satellite
sequences and so that their duplication relies on the
production of proteins by autonomous entities, either
from exogenous Caulimoviridae, or from endogenous
elements.
Proposed work Combining information from several
endogenous copies enables reconstructing consensus se-
quences that closely determine native elements. To
disentangle the genetic relationships and functional in-
teractions dening these networks, we will perform an
accurate reconstruction of Caulimoviridae and related
EVE sequences in several plant genomes, starting with
species such as oak, vine, and citrus, for which we
have collected exemplary data. The acquired method-
ology will be automatized and transposed to dozens
of plant genomes to identify, characterize and com-
pare Caulimoviridae sequence networks. Comparing
Caulimoviridae networks across plant families with high
EVE content and for which a substantial set of genomes
are publicly available (e.g. Solanaceae) or to which we
have access in the context of collaborations (e.g. Ru-
taceae) will allow determining the time of emergence
and performing detailed co-evolution analyses to gain
further insights into the evolution of this complex plant
pathosystem.
Prole §The successful applicant will have a Ph.D in
bioinformatics and substantial experience in the elds
of evolutionary biology, virology or genomics. §He/She
will be familiar with dierent programming languages.§He/She will be autonomous, creative and dedicated,

Practical GWAS Using Linux and R
23-27 October 2017, Berlin (Germany)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course15/
INSTRUCTOR
Dr Jing Hua Zhao (https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
instructors/t20/)
Trained in medicine, medical statistics and statistical ge-
netics, he had worked on statistical and computational
methods for epidemiological and public health studies at
several institutions until 2005, when he joined the MRC
Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, to work on
design and analysis of GWAS such as the EPIC-Norfolk,
the Fenland and the InterAct. He has also participated
in numerous genetic analysis workshops which involve
both simulated and real data such as those from the
Framingham heart study. Besides methodological devel-
opment, data analysis, and other academic activities, he
has also had tutorials on genetic dissection of complex
traits with focus on GWAS at UseR! 2008, 2009, and
2010 Conferences and contributed a Henry-Stewart talk
on genetic association with R.
Overview
The past decade has witnessed an astonishing develop-
ment and the universal use of genome wide association
studies (GWAS) in identication and characterisationof genetic variants underlying disorders and other varia-
tions in human and other species, which has an immense
impact in biomedical research. This is owing to the abil-
ity to eciently generate and process large quantity
of genetic polymorphisms as well as to integrate with
other sources such as gene expression and methylation.
To tackle challenges in GWAS, a lot of methods and
techniques have been established but many others are
still evolving. The workshop therefore intends to give a
grand picture as well as practical aspects of GWAS.
Targeted audience and assumed background
The purpose of this workshop is to render both a broad
picture and computational details of GWAS to biomed-
ical researchers and related elds. It sets to explore
the biological, statistical, and computational concepts,
methodologies and practices involving a variety of soft-
ware based on Linux and R. Examples of consortium
contributions will also be given. These will be par-
ticularly benecial to those who come with their own
problems and wish to implement the analysis.
Structure
The workshop contains both lecture and computer ses-
sions, designed to help participants to understand the
background, methodology and implementation. The
computer session is designed to facilitate data analysis
and interpretation.

course2/ 2-6 October 2017, Berlin (Germany)
Instructor:
Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/
Course overview
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at complete beginners and as-
sumes no prior programming experience. It gives an
overview of the language with an emphasis on practical
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn
from various aspects of bioinformatics work. After com-
pleting the workshop, students should be in a position
to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackling
problems in their own research and (2) continue their
Python education in a self-directed way. All course
materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared by
the instructing team) will be provided electronically to
participants. Intended audience
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. If in doubt,

Session content
Monday 2nd - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30122 EvolDir September 1, 2017
Session 1 - Introduction
In this session I introduce the students to Python and
explain what we expect them to get out of it and how
learning to program can benet their research. I explain
the format of the course and take care of any housekeep-
ing details (like coee breaks and catering arrangements).
I outline the edit-run-x cycle of software development
and talk about how to avoid common text editing er-
rors. In this session, we also check that the computing
infrastructure for the rest of the course is in place (e.g.
making sure that everybody has an appropriate version
of Python installed). Core concepts introduced: source
code, text editors, whitespace, syntax and syntax errors,
Python versions
Session 2 - Output and text manipulation
In this session students learn to write very simple pro-
grams that produce output to the terminal, and in doing
so become comfortable with editing and running Python
code. This session also introduces many of the technical
terms that we'll rely on in future sessions. I run through
some examples of tools for working with text and show
how they work in the context of biological sequence
manipulation. We also cover dierent types of errors
and error messages, and learn how to go about xing
them methodically. Core concepts introduced: termi-
nals, standard output, variables and naming, strings
and characters, special characters, output formatting,
statements, functions, methods, arguments, comments.
Tuesday 3rd - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3 - File IO and user interfaces
I introduce this session by talking about the impor-
tance of les in bioinformatics pipelines and workows,
and we then explore the Python interfaces for reading
from and writing to les. This involves introducing
the idea of types and objects, and a bit of discussion
about how Python interacts with the operating system.
The practical session is spent combining the techniques
from session 2 with the le IO tools to create basic le-
processing scripts. Core concepts introduced: objects
and classes, paths and folders, relationships between
variables and values, text and binary les, newlines.
Session 4 - Flow control 1 : loops
A discussion of the limitations of the techniques learned
in session 3 quickly reveals that ow control is required
to write more sophisticated le-processing programs,
and I introduce the concept of loops. We look at the
way in which Python loops work, and how they can be
used in a variety of contexts. We explore the use of
loops and lists together to tackle some more dicult
problems. Core concepts introduced: lists and arrays,blocks and indentation, variable scoping, iteration and
the iteration interface, ranges.
Wednesday 4th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 5 -Flow control 2 : conditionals
I use the idea of decision-making as a way to introduce
conditional tests, and outline the dierent building-
blocks of conditions before showing how conditions can
be combined in an expressive way. We look at the dier-
ent ways that we can use conditions to control program
ow, and how we can structure conditions to keep pro-
grams readable. Core concepts introduced: Truth and
falsehood, Boolean logic, identity and

Sept. 20 - Friday Sept. 22) will address implementation
of statistical analyses with R, particularly linear models.
I will make frequent use of my library asbio (Applied
Statistics and Statistical Pedagogy for Biologists), and
present the materials using biological examples whenever
possible.
Intended audience This course is aimed at scientists,
particularly biologists. While no previous experience
with R is required, participants should have at least a
basic familiarity with statistical terms and concepts.
Curriculum
Monday 18th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1 - R basics In this session we will briey con-
sider the history of R, including trends in usage and
package development, the relationship of R to other
languages and platforms, and the reliability of R base
and user-contributed packages. We will then learn and
conduct basic command line operations, including den-
ing R programming options, saving work, mathematical
functions, simple descriptive statistics functions, uti-
lization of expressions and assignments, R-objects and
classes, auxiliary R-packages, accessing and exploring
internal R datasets, and getting help.
Session 2 - R graphics In this session we consider the
properties, capabilities, and extensions of R graphics.
Session topics will include discussion of the R graphi-
cal devices, learning how to alter parameters to make
simple plots and multilayer complex plots (e.g., those
containing multiple distinct graphs, multiple y and x-
axes, unusual fonts, 3d graphics, etc.), lattice graphics,
graphical packages (particularly ggplot) and the creation
of publication-ready high resolution gures.
|{
Tuesday 19th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3 - Handling data in R The session will address
handling data in R. Topics will include properties of R
data structures (i.e., vectors, matrices, dataframes, and
arrays), command line data entry, importing/exporting
delimited spreadsheets and other data, subsetting and
querying data, testing and coercing objects, pattern
matching, and functions for matrix/dataframe/array
management and manipulation.
Session 4 - Writing functions The session will consider
user-dened functions using several extended examples.
Topics will include looping, graphical animation, the uti-lization and development of GUIs, and calling routines
from compiled languages.
|{
Wednesday 20th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 5 - Documentation of work in R and basic ap-
plications in statistics
This session will conclude topics in function writing by
considering approaches for documenting workow and
function characteristics in R. The session will then turn
to the topic of statistical analysis in earnest. Topics
will include probability density functions, point estima-
tion (including least squares, maximum likelihood and
MOM approaches), and intervallic estimators, including
conventional condence intervals on a priori sampling
distribution assumptions, along with bootstrapping ap-
proaches and Bayesian credible intervals.
Session 6 - General linear models I We will begin this
session by considering simple methods for making in-
ferences concerning the dierence in measures of popu-
lation location parameters, e.g., t-tests and their non-
parametric analogues. We will then introduce general
linear models with simple and multiple regression. Em-
phasis will be given to model selection approaches.
|{
Thursday 21st - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 7 - General linear models II
This session will continue exploration of general linear
models by considering ANOVA approaches including
one way ANOVAs with xed and random eects, two
way designs including factorial designs and blocked de-
signs as xed and mixed eect models. We will also
consider methods for simultaneous inference for factor
level comparisons.
Session 8 - Generalized linear models, locally tted mod-
els, and associated topics
This session will briey consider R applications for spe-
cialized response variables and locally tted models.
Topics will include logistic

ESEB 2017 SATELLITE WORKSHOP ON TUESDAY,
22 AUGUST
THE EUROPEAN DROSOPHILA POPULATION GE-
NOMICS CONSORTIUM (DROSEU)
We would like to kindly invite you to participate in a
satellite discussion workshop on Drosophila population
genomics and evolution, held during the ESEB 2017
meeting in Groningen (16th Congress of the European
Society for Evolutionary Biology, 20-25 August 2017;
Groningen; http://www.eseb2017.nl).
The workshop will be held (contrary to our previous
announcement) on Tuesday 22 August between 15:00and 17:00 in room J.
The workshop is open to all interested ESEB partici-
pants/evolutionary biologists.
The main aim of the workshop is to present the work
and the objectives of the European Drosophila Pop-
ulation Genomics Consortium (DrosEU), funded by
an ESEB Special Topics Network (STN) grant, to the
ESEB/evolutionary biology community and to discuss
future developments in the eld of Drosophila adapta-
tion genomics.
The DrosEU consortium, founded in 2013, consists of
approx. 70 scientists from Europe and beyond: over the
past few years, we have been sampling and sequencing
a large number of European Drosophila melanogaster
populations through space and time. The overarch-
ing goal of DrosEU is to foster the integration and
exchange of population genomic information and data
in the Drosophila system and to cooperate closely in col-
lecting, generating and analyzing genomic and environ-
mental data for numerous Drosophila populations across
Europe and beyond in order to gain a better understand-
ing of adaptation. DrosEU is also closely collaborating
with the US-based Drosophila Real Time Evolution
Consortium (Dros-RTEC) (http://web.sas.upenn.edu/-
paul-schmidt-lab/dros-rtec).

ESEB 2017 WORKSHOP: SCIENCE POLICIES:
HOW SHOULD EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY BE
FUNDED?
We would like to invite you to participate in a discussion
workshop on funding and scientic quality to be held
during the upcoming ESEB conference in Groningen
(20-25 August 2017).
Open: To all researchers attending the ESEB conference
(no additional costs) Time: Thursday, 24 August, 13:30-
15:30 Place: Room X Organizers: Stephanie Meirmans
and Maurine Neiman
The main goal of our workshop is to trigger a translat-
able discussion of how funding aects scientic quality,
what scientic quality is, and whether and how the cur-
rent funding system could improve. We invite you as ac-
tive researchers to participate and make contributions to
this discussion. Our workshop focus is particularly topi-
cal because of recent changes in how science is funded
worldwide: increasingly, funding is both assessed by
internal scientic quality and by external criteria such
as societal relevance and technological-economic impact.
These changes have created across-country dierences in
funding policies, inviting a critical systematic reection
that could have real impact in a time when funding
policies are in a phase of transition in many countries.
The workshop will consist of a short comment on this
topic by ESEB founder Stephen Stearns, two panel dis-
cussions, and one talk by an internationally recognized
invited speaker with direct involvement in research fund-
ing, Leslie Rissler (US National Science Foundation).
The two panels will consist of Roger Butlin, George
Gilchrist, Hanna Kokko, and Stephen Stearns (Panel 1),
and Anne Charmantier, Jan Engelst adter, Astrid Groot,
Kayla King, Pleuni Pennings and Jane Reid (Panel 2).
The audience will be invited to actively participate in
the discussion, so please come prepared with questions
and insights.
This event is funded by the American Genetic Associa-
tion (AGA).
We are looking forward to seeing you at our workshop!
Best wishes, Stephanie and Maurine

MetagenomicsBarcoding Mar19-23
Dear colleagues,
Registration is open for the course AN INTRODUC-
TION TO METAGENOMICS AND METABARCOD-
ING.
Dates: March 19-23, 2018.
Place: Heraklion (Crete, Greece).
Instructor: Dr. M. Lisandra Zepeda-Mendoza (Chr.
Hansen - Bacterial Physiology & Improvement, Den-
mark).
Metagenomics is the study of the collection of genomes
in an environment. Environments as diverse as Antarc-
tic lakes, hot springs, or the human gut can be bio-
logically characterized by extracting and sequencing
DNA from samples taken from them. A characteristic
of many of these samples is their complexity, posing
diculties to their analysis and characterization. How-
ever, metagenomics allows the taxonomic and functional
characterization of samples. These two kinds of char-
acterizations also enable the comparison of dierent
habitats for biodiversity assessment.
In this course students will be introduced to the com-
mand line environment used to analyze high-throughput
sequencing data (HTS). The initial cleaning steps that
must be performed on every HTS dataset will be de-
scribed and we will use the processed data for proper
functional and taxonomical characterization of a metage-
nomic dataset. We will use methods such as mapping
to whole genome databases, de novo assembly, gene
annotation, building of non-redundant gene catalogue,
and metagenomic species concept identication. Due
to the wide usage of metabarcoding for the taxonomic
characterization of an environment, we will also dis-
cuss amplicon sequencing strategies and data analysis.
The course will be based on both theory and hands-on
exercises.130 EvolDir September 1, 2017

Workshop Announcement: Best practices for using NGS-
based datasets to determine statistically robust evidence
of positive selection and convergent evolution of polar
organisms.
We will conduct a NSF-funded workshop using cross-
disciplinary approaches for determining genetic adap-
tations in polar organisms using Next Generation
Sequencing-based datasets. In particular, this work-
shop will focus on the following:
1) Establish collaborative research groups to test for
genes under positive selection from diverse polar organ-
isms using genomic and transcriptomic datasets.
2) Evaluate current analytical methods for determining
positively selected genes and their statistical signi-
cance.
3) Explore current and novel methodologies for detect-
ing genetic modications acquired through convergent
evolution in response to similar environmental condi-
tions.
4) Review lab-based protocols for demonstrating the
potential functions of candidate genes. Specically, we
will focus on techniques amenable to frozen or otherwise
preserved samples that can be accomplished at the home
institutional laboratory.
We will conduct a full-day meeting (9am-5pm) before
the start of the next two conference meetings of theSociety for Integrative and Comparative Biology (San
Francisco, CA and Tampa, FL, January 3rd, 2018 and
2019, respectively) with collaborative work among the re-
search groups during the interim period. The requested
funds will be used to reimburse the costs of travel to
each meeting (up to $300/meeting), SICB meeting regis-
tration, and one night of lodging (up to $200/meeting),
for all workshop participants per meeting. Workshop
participants will contribute to a nal report summa-
rizing our ndings that will be available through the
iDigBio website. We will also publish a multi-authored
paper based on the relative contributions of participants
towards data acquisition, NGS-based analyses, and the
review of lab-based protocols.
Prospective participants should have documented re-
search backgrounds in ONE or more of the following
categories: 1) NGS-based studies of polar organisms,
2) Methodologies for determining genes under positive
selection or showing evidence of convergent evolution
(PAML, HyPHy, Phytools, etc.), 3) Phylogenomics of
polar organisms, and 4) Physiological adaptations of
polar organisms.

for-population-genetics-rdpg01/ This course will runSeptember 1, 2017 EvolDir 133
from the 23rd - 27th October at Margam discovery
centre in Wales, United Kingdom.
Course Overview: With the increasing availability of
various types of genetic and genomic data, population
genetics and molecular ecology are becoming largely
data driven sciences. Understanding the evolutionary,
demographic, and ecological underpinning the genetic
makeup of natural populations now relies on a com-
bination of exploratory approaches and models. This
course will provide an in-depth introduction to these
techniques, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility
though the use of modern analytic practices and tools.
After an introduction to phylogenetic reconstruction, the
course will cover a number of multivariate approaches
for the analysis of genetic patterns, including super-
vised and unsupervised factorial methods, clustering
approaches, and advanced methods for describing popu-
lation diversity and revealing spatial genetic patterns.
The approaches introduced will be applicable to most
genetic data, including markers such as microsatellites,
SNPs, or AFLP, as well as nucleotide and amino-acid
sequence data. Every day will start with a lecture ded-
icated to a type of problem and methods, followed by
an introduction to a specic technique for reproducible
data analysis; afternoon will be devoted to hands on
praticals. The last day will be devoted to open prob-
lems, where participants will be able to analyse their
own data.

\Structural Equation Modelling for Ecologists and Evo-
lutionary Biologists"
Delivered by Dr. Jarret Byrnes and Dr. Jon Lefcheck
www.prstatistics.com/course/structural-equation-
modelling-for-ecologists-and-evolutionary-biologists-
semr01/ This course will run from 23rd - 27th October
2017 at Margam Park Discovery Centre, Wales, UK
Course only and all inclusive packages are available.
The course is a primer on structural equation modelling
(SEM) and conrmatory path analysis, with an em-
phasis on practical skills and applications to real-world
data.
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is a rapidly grow-
ing technique in ecology and evolution that unites multi-
ple hypotheses in a single causal network. It provides an
intuitive graphical representation of relationships among
variables, underpinned by well-described mathematical
estimation procedures. Several advances in SEM over
the past few years have expanded its utility for typical
ecological datasets, which include count data, missing
observations, and nested or hierarchical designs. We
will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide
approachable mathematical explanations of the tech-
niques, and cover recent extensions to mixed eects
models and non-normal distributions. Along the way,
we will work through many examples from the primary
literature using the open- source statistical software
R (www.r-project.org). We will draw on two popular
R packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan andpiecewiseSEM. Participants are encouraged to bring
their own data, as there will be opportunities through-
out the course to plan, analyse, and receive feedback on
structural equation models.
Course content is as follows
Day 1 Introduction to SEM Module 1: What is Struc-
tural Equation Modeling? Why would I use it? Module
2: Creating multivariate causal models Module 3: Fit-
ting piecewise models Readings: Grace 2010 (overview),

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
