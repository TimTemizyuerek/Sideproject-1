THEME AND SCOPE
The continuing advance of DNA sequencing technol-
ogy has produced an avalanche of genome sequence
and genome structural information across the evolu-
tionary spectrum. Transforming that information into
biological knowledge requires creative and innovative
new computational and statistical methods for compar-
ative genomics.
The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Ge-
nomics aims to provide the premier forum for new com-
putational developments applied to all aspects of com-
parative genomics. We solicit contributions on topics
including comparison of genome structure and organi-
zation, genome function, and evolution. We particu-
larly encourage contributions that use new computa-
tional methods to acquire new insight into biological
processes. Advances in computational theory are wel-
come, though all submissions should include genome-
scale analyses informed by comparative data.
All peer-reviewed and accepted RECOMB-CG
manuscripts will be published in a supplement to BMC
Bioinformatics as open-access, author-subsidized,
articles.
Speciﬁc topics of interest include but are not limited
to:
Gene and genome duplication Gene family evolu-
tion Genome structural variation Algorithms for com-
parative genomics Genome rearrangement Ancestral
genome reconstruction Multiple genome alignment
Genome sequence comparison Modeling genome evo-
lution Comparative genomics for genome annotation
Gene tree reconciliation Species and gene tree in-
ference Comparative metagenomics Comparative ge-
nomics linked to proteomics, metabolomics, and other
~omic data Comparative genomics and gene expression
and regulation Applications of comparative genomic
methods

NOMINATIONS/APPLICATIONS: April 25, 2012
PROGRAM OUTLINE
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) is pleased to make available 10 awards for un-
dergraduate students to participate in a Mentoring and
Diversity Program. Five of these positions will be re-
served for undergraduates from traditionally underrep-
resented groups in our scientiﬁc discipline.
The goals of this program are: (1) to provide students
with the opportunity to experience the excitement of
attending and presenting at an international scientiﬁc
conference, (2) to foster enthusiasm for molecular biol-
ogy and evolution as well as a possible career in this
ﬁeld, and (3) to promote diversity at the SMBE annual
meeting.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Mentoring and Diversity Program Award
will be paired with one mentor (postdoctoral fellow or
faculty member). Mentors will serve as contact points
for the students, attend some sessions with the stu-
dents, and, more generally, explain the ’goings-on’ at
a multi-day scientiﬁc conference in order to minimize
the anxiety often felt by ﬁrst-time conference attendees.
The mentors will also facilitate connections to graduate
students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty members.
ELIGIBILITY
Candidates must currently be enrolled as undergradu-
ate students (i.e. pre-doctoral students, e.g. a Bache-
lor’s level degree in USA) or have graduated within the
last 6 months at the time of application. Some awards
will be reserved for undergraduates from traditionally
underrepresented groups in our scientiﬁc discipline.
CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION
Recipients of an SMBE Undergraduate Diversity Men-
toring Program Award will be invited to present their
research at a special reception/poster session attended
by their mentors, supervisors and other interested con-
ference participants.
AWARDS
Ten awards will be given. Award recipients residing
in Europe will receive US $1,000 to be used to help
cover the cost of airfare, accommodation, and meeting
registration. All other recipients will receive US $1,500.
Each participant will also receive an online student sub-
scription to the journal Molecular Biology and Evolu-
tion for the year of 2013.APPLICATION
1. Faculty members may nominate undergraduates by
sending a brief letter of recommendation and the ab-
stract of the work to be presented at the poster session.
The single PDF ﬁle should be sent to Dr. Laurent Duret
(Laurent.Duret@univ-lyon1.fr).
OR
2. Students may apply for the award themselves by
providing information on their background, academic
status, the email address of their supervisor, and an
abstract of the work to be presented at the poster ses-
sion. The single PDF ﬁle should be sent to Dr. Laurent
Duret (Laurent.Duret@univ-lyon1.fr).

Dear colleagues,
I am pleased to send this SECOND circular of the an-
nual conference of the German Society of Mammalogy.
As you know, this year this international conference
will be hosted at the Senckenberg Institute and Nat-
ural History Museum in Frankfurt (Main), Germany.
PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO REGISTER! Main
organiser is the Conservation Genetics Group, and sev-
eral other Senckenberg and BIK-F groups are involved
as well. DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACTS: MAY 28 !!!
–>http://www.senckenberg.de/dgs2012 <–
The conference theme is “The Past, Present and Fu-
ture of Mammalian Diversity”, and hence all topics in
Mammalian Biology are covered in a modern and multi-
disciplinary atmosphere. There will be three days of
conference with talks and poster sessions, divided into
the (non-exclusive) topics:
- past (palaeontology, ancient DNA, phylogeny, phylo-
geography, evolution ...) - present (population struc-
ture and distribution, behaviour, physiology, morphol-
ogy, current policy, other open topics ...) - future (con-
servation, policy making, predictive modelling, climate
change, evolution again ...)
We have invited three plenary speakers to cover and
introduce cutting-edge research in each of these groups
of topics:
- Michael Hofreiter ( http://www.york.ac.uk/biology/-
research/ecology-evolution/michael-hofreiter/ ) - Phil
Stephens ( http://www.dur.ac.uk/philip.stephens/-
welcome.htm ) - Herbert H.T. Prins ( http://-
www.reg.wur.nl/UK/Staﬀ/Prins/ )
We are looking forward to a major event this late sum-
mer, and hope to welcome participants from a diverse
range of topics and backgrounds.
With best regards, on behalf of the organising commit-
tee,

Ottawa iEvoBio Informatics
Jul10-11 CallForSoftware
The Call for Software Bazaar entries is now open for
the 2012 conference on Informatics for Phylogenet-
ics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http:/-
/ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012 . See below
for instructions.
The Software Bazaar features presenters demonstrat-
ing their software live on a laptop. At iEvoBio, this
session takes the place of a poster session, and will be
approximately 2.0 hours in duration. Conference atten-
dees will be able to walk from one demonstration to the
next and talk with the presenters. Please also see our
FAQ ( http://ievobio.org/faq.html ).May 1, 2012 EvolDir 11
Entries should be software aimed at advancing research
in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, and can
include interactive visualizations that have been pre-
computed (such as SVGs, or Google Earth-compatible
KML ﬁles). Note that commercial marketing activi-
ties are not permitted - presenters wishing to promote
commercial or proprietary services or products should
contact the Evolution conference about exhibitor space
(http://www.confersense.ca/Evolution2012 ).
Submissions consist of a title, which will typically be
the name of the software (or visualization method) be-
ing presented, the URL of a website where more infor-
mation can be obtained, and the license under which
the source code is available. The website must contain
a link to where the source code (and possibly bina-
ries) can be downloaded. If it is not obvious from the
website, the submission must describe what the soft-
ware does. Reviewers will judge whether a submission
is within scope of the conference (see above), and need
to be able to verify whether the open-source require-
ment(*) is met.
Presenters are expected to bring their own laptops for
presentation, and any auxiliary devices necessary (such
as a mouse). Power will be available at the presenta-
tion tables (110V/60Hz, US-style plugs; international
presenters need to bring a suitable adaptor). Please let
the organizing committee know as much in advance as
possible if you expect to have unusually high demands
for wireless network bandwidth, a large display, or other
hardware.
Review and acceptance of Software Bazaar submissions
will be on a rolling basis. The deadline for submission is
the morning of the ﬁrst day of the conference (July 10),
but, because space for Software Bazaar presentations is
ﬁnite, we cannot guarantee the availability of slots for
late submissions. We cannot accept submissions until
the open-source requirements are met.
Software Bazaar demonstrations are only 1 of 5 kinds
of contributed content that iEvoBio will feature. The
other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3)
Challenge entries, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings.
The Calls for Challenge entries ( http://ievobio.org/-
challenge.html ) and Lightning Talks (same submission
URL as above) remain open, and the Birds-of-a-Feather
call is forthcoming.

Information about symposium
Traditional life history theory attempts to describe the
ultimate processes involved in the evolution of pheno-
types and how traits are constrained by energetic trade-
oﬀs. This approach conventionally ignores the under-
lying proximate mechanisms, and yet the fundamental
problems in life history evolution can only be fully re-
solved with an understanding of the underlying devel-
opmental, physiological, and genetic mechanisms. Our
symposium highlights current research that uses novel
molecular techniques and study systems to shed new
light on traditional life-history questions.Information on speakers

Dear Colleagues
We are pleased to announce that a two-day session on
the Evolution of Physiological Traits will be held as
part of the Society for Experimental Biology (SEB) An-
nual Meeting in Salzburg (29th June-2nd July 2012).
We have a number of slots that are held open for con-
tributed talks, and invite you to submit an abstract
and / or register to attend the meeting. Submission of
abstracts closes on 4th May, and the deadline for early
bird registration is 11th May.
Full details on the conference, its venue, and in-
structions on how to submit your abstract can
be found at: http://www.sebiology.org/meetings/-
Salzburg2012/Salzburg.html SEB supports the at-
tendance of students and other early career scien-
tists via travel grants: http://www.sebiology.org/-
meetings/Salzburg2012/grants.html Overview Recent
advances in phylogenetics, genomics, physiology and
paleobiology have brought major advances in our un-
derstanding of how physiological processes have evolved
in autotrophic organisms (microbes and plants). This
session will bring together leading ﬁgures in each of
these ﬁelds, aiming to provide a stimulating, multi-
disciplinary view of physiological trait evolution and,
tackling a number of key questions. What were the im-
portant evolutionary innovations in the history of au-
totrophic organisms? What do we know about the ori-
gins of these physiological processes? What are the key
drivers of trait diversiﬁcation? Does selection favour
distinct combinations of physiological traits? What are
the biophysical constraints on the adaptive landscape?
How have the same physiological syndromes evolved in-
dependently in multiple lineages? How have past evolu-
tionary events changed the Earth System, and how will
ongoing global change drive physiological adaptations
in wild and agricultural plant species? We welcome
contributions in any of these areas.
Speakers * Bill Martin (Heinrich Heine University) -
Cyanobacterial phylogenomics and the origins of plas-
tids. * David Beerling (University of Sheﬃeld) - The

Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. * John Raven (Uni-
versity of Dundee) - Carbon dioxide ﬁxation by au-
totrophs: alternatives to the Benson-Calvin cycle. *
Howard Griﬃths (University of Cambridge) - Photo-
synthesis in early land plant life forms and the origins
of carbon concentrating mechanisms. * Lawren Sack
(UCLA) - Adaptation of leaf venation in terrestrial
plant radiations. * Erika Edwards (Brown University)- A phylogenetic perspective on the evolution of succu-
lence. * Lisa Donovan (University of Georgia) - Evolu-

BournemouthU ParasiteDiversity
Fully funded PhD Opportunity at Bournemouth Uni-
versity, UK
Identifying drivers of parasite diversity hotspots and
disease emergence in the UK. Emergence of disease
is a major threat to biodiversity. Due to the intense
sampling eﬀort involved, factors driving disease emer-
gence are studied at a microecological level. A holistic
approach in managing biodiversity including data on
parasite diversity patterns, climate and socioeconomic
parameters will provide far more informative results.
Here we propose the use of extensive datasets on par-
asite diversity and socioeconomic factors to determine
parasite diversity hotspots in the UK. The project will
combine multivariate statistical models and new data to
identify the major drivers aﬀecting disease emergence,
resistance to parasite invasion and biodiversity homog-
enization. A predictive model to identify hotspots of
future disease emergence will be developed.

PHENOTYPIC SELECTION AND QUANTITATIVE
EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES IN IMMUNE DE-
FENCE TRAITS IN NATURE
Parasites present a serious and continuous threat for
natural populations of most free-living species. Im-
mune defence is generally considered as an important
trait in determining organisms’ ﬁtness as it eliminates
harmful parasites. Therefore, understanding the evo-
lution of immune defence is one of the key topics in
predicting dynamics of host-parasite interactions. How-
ever, knowledge on the type and strength of selection
on quantitative immune defence traits and their evolu-
tionary responses are generally lacking in most natural
systems. In this project, phenotypic selection and its re-18 EvolDir May 1, 2012
lation to quantitative genetic variation in host immune
defence traits will be examined in natural populations
of a freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The goals of
the project are to assess (1) the type and strength of
phenotypic selection on immune defence traits and their
potential responses to selection across host populations
depending on the risk of infection and host genetic poly-
morphism, (2) variation in selection imposed by diﬀer-
ent parasite types (specialist parasites, opportunistic
microbes), and (3) what is the relative importance of
immune defence traits in determining hosts’ suscepti-
bility to infections when considering factors that deter-
mine their exposure (i.e. contact with parasites)?
We invite highly motivated students with a good back-
ground in evolutionary ecology to apply for the posi-
tion. A MSc or equivalent degree is required. Earlier
experience with snails or immunological work is not re-
quired. The student will work in a research group led
by Prof. Jukka Jokela (Eawag/ETH Zurich, Switzer-
land). The project is funded by Swiss National Science
Foundation for 3 years.

MarineMammalGenomics
PhD position in Marine Mammal Evolutionary ge-
nomics (1.0 fte) (Reference number 212075)
Organisation
The PhD position is with the Marine Evolution and
Conservation (MarECon) group at the Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Studies (CEES) which is
placed with the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural
Sciences at the University of Groningen in the Nether-
lands. The research conducted by the members of
MarECon is aimed at the evolution and conservation of
pelagic marine organisms, in particular marine mam-
mals. We are interested in those processes that parti-
tion genetic variation within those species that inhabitthis comparatively open environment. Our primary re-
search approach is population genetics and genomics.
The research is conducted with a global network of col-
laborators who collect data and tissue samples in the
ﬁeld.
Job description
The pinnipeds and cetaceans represent some of the
most derived mammal groups. The many convergent
features in these two groups provide clear evidence of
the strong natural selection the mammal “bauplan” is
subjected to when transitioning to a marine existence.
The combination of strong convergent evolution in dif-
ferent lineages of mammals constitutes an excellent op-
portunity to gain insights into the genomic underpin-
nings of the evolution and adaptation in pinnipeds and
cetaceans and the subsequent radiations into diﬀerent
distinct marine habitats.
The objective of this PhD project is to utilize genome
enabled methods to identify those traits under past and
recent selection in pinnipeds and cetaceans. The re-
search will mainly consist of genome wide-scans in se-
lect population samples and subsequent bioinformatics
and population genomic analyses of those data. The
newly ﬁtted laboratory is situated in the new green
building Linneausborg on the Zernike Campus with ex-
cellent facilities for this kind of work.
The PhD student will be supervised by Dr. Martine
B´ erub´ e and Prof. Per Palsbøll.
Qualiﬁcations
We are looking for a highly motivated person with a
master’s degree in biology or equivalent discipline, with
a strong background in empirical and theoretical pop-
ulation genetics. The ideal candidate for this position
has good quantitative skills and the ability to conduct
bioinformatics analyses of the large amounts of short-
read sequence data. Programming skills (or the interest
and ability to acquire such) is a necessity. The candi-
date should be able to work and solve problems inde-
pendently. Some knowledge of marine mammals is ben-
eﬁcial, but not a prerequisite. It should be noted that
the opportunities for ﬁeldwork will be few and brief.
A good command of English is required. The candi-
date will be enrolled in Groningen Graduate School of
Science, attend graduate courses within the Research
School Ecology and Evolution and participate in our
teaching program (10% of time).
Conditions of employment
The University of Groningen oﬀers a salary of EUR
2,042 gross per month in the ﬁrst year up to a maxi-
mum of EUR 2,612 gross per month in the ﬁnal year.May 1, 2012 EvolDir 19
The employment is initially in a temporary position of
1.5 years with possible extension with another 2.5 years
provided satisfactory performance during the ﬁrst year.
The PhD candidate will be evaluated after the ﬁrst
year in order to determine the likelihood of the success-
ful completion of the PhD thesis within the following
three years. If a successful completion is deemed un-
likely, the employment will not be extended. The main
objective of the position is to publish research articles
in peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals. These publications
will form the basis of the doctoral thesis and obtaining
the PhD degree (Dr) at the University of Groningen.
Application A full complete application in English con-
sists of a letter describing your personal motivation for
applying for this position outlining which skills perti-
nent to the position you have, past experience as well as

Evolutionary Biologist Ph.D. graduate student posi-
tions available
The Klink lab in the Department of Biological Sci-
ences at Mississippi State University currently is seek-
ing Ph.D.-level graduate students to begin in fall, 2012.
The Klink lab focuses in on understanding the pro-
cesses of plant-animal coevolution through niche estab-
lishment, development and maintenance by a pathogen
in its host. Central to the work is cell-type-speciﬁc
gene expression proﬁling. The model for the work
is the soybean-soybean cyst nematode pathosystem,
which has allowed for the identiﬁcation of genes that
relate to niche development (Matsye et al. 2011).
The genome of the allotetraploid soybean has been se-
quenced (Schmutz et al. 2010), allowing for a number
of cellular and developmental questions concerning the
evolution of polyploidy to be addressed at the molec-
ular level (Matsye et al. in review). This work in-
cludes genotype-speciﬁc allele analyses and quantitative
studies of gene expression in speciﬁc root cells undergo-
ing infection. This knowledge allows for addressing the
subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization of home-
ologs and adaptive evolution of the complex trait. The
development of a genetic engineering pipeline has per-
mitted the high throughput testing of genes, allowing
for the determination of how the genes function in the
process. The Klink lab is housed in the newly renovated
Harned Hall that has all the necessary modern equip-
ment to perform the research. For inquiries, please con-
tact Dr. Vincent Klink, vklink@biology.msstate.edu.

Abstract of the PhD project:
Understanding the origin and persistence of diversity
within and among species in a central question in evo-
lutionary biology. Genetic dominance among variants
in a population plays a key role in the invasion success
of new adaptive traits.
This Phd project focuses on the distribution of mor-
phological and genetic variation of mimic patterns in
neotropical butterﬂies from the genus Heliconius. In
these species, many species exhibit a mutual adaptive
resemblance. This convergence so called mimicry con-
stitutes an aposematic signal of their unpalatability,
which can be learned by predators. Several mimicry
rings coexist in a given habitat and some polymor-
phic species are involved in few distinct mimicry rings.
These polymorphic species constitute an ideal model to
understand how new adaptive traits can be established
and can be favored by selection.
In this context, since the level of dominance is modify-
ing the expression of diﬀerent variants, it had an inﬂu-
ence on their resemblance to the mimic patterns. Hence
the origin and persistence of new variants depends both
on dominance and discrimination capacities of preda-tors. We thus aimed at jointly investigating how the
variation is genetically controlled in the polymorphic
species Heliconius numata and how predators can per-
ceive this variation.

NewZealand Insect Genomics
Genome evolution, speciation and molecular population
genetics of stick insects
Supervisor: Associate Professor Thomas Buckley Co-
supervisors: Associate Professor Richard Newcomb, Dr
Howard Ross
Next generation DNA sequencing and analysis of whole
genomes has opened new possibilities for testing funda-
mental questions in speciation and adaptation. The
successful candidate for this PhD project will generate
a draft genome sequence for a New Zealand stick insect
(Clitarchus hookeri) and use this as a tool for exploringdetailed questions on adaptation within a species and
between closely related species. The common stick in-
sect (Clitarchus hookeri) is widespread through much of
New Zealand. This species is particularly interesting at
it is a geographic parthenogen and has hybridized with
closely related species. The successful candidate will
perform Illumina sequencing and assemble and anno-
tate a draft genome. This draft genome will be used as
a scaﬀold for RAD-tag studies of SNP variation within
C. hookeri and among closely related species. Tran-
scriptome data will also be collected and mapped to
the draft genome to obtain candidate genes underlying
phenotypic traits for further studies on selection and
adaptation. Variation at candidate genes will be mea-
sured and compared within and among populations of
C. hookeri and among related species. The successful
candidate should have experience in molecular evolu-
tion and genomics with an interest in developing skills
in the assembly and analysis of Next Generation DNA
sequence data. This project is funded by the Allan Wil-
son Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution and in-
cludes a $25,000 NZD per year scholarship, $5,000 for
tuition fees, and funding for international travel.

Introduction Brown algae (Phaeophyta) are multicellu-
lar marine organisms that diverged from animals and
land plants over a billion years ago. They are predom-
inant primary producers in temperate and cold coastal
seas, and of relevance to the rapidly-expanding aqua-
culture industry. Like any other species, brown algae
are plagued by diseases, and their pathogens are in-
creasingly recognised as pleiotropic environmental and
evolutionary drivers [1]. The host laboratory has es-
tablished the interaction between the genome model
seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus [2] and the oomycete
pathogen Eurychasma dicksonii as a model to elucidate
the defence reactions of brown algae. The overarching
objective of this project is to understand how and why
some brown algae are capable to resist pathogen infec-
tion, when others are not.
This project encompasses the following research ob-
jectives: 1) comparative description of cellular events
characteristic of disease susceptibility and resistance.
The hypersensitive response (HR) has been the cor-
nerstone of plant pathology for over a century. Sig-
niﬁcantly, we found that across Phaeophyta, disease
resistance is also mediated by HR. This is accompa-
nied by the speciﬁc deposition of ﬂuorescent secondary
metabolites, cell wall reinforcement and expression of
speciﬁc cell death markers. The student will undertake
further in-depth characterisation of these responses us-
ing real-time PCR, immunostaining biochemical assays,
and highly innovative spatially- resolved metabolite
and protein imaging techniques. 2) detailed charac-
terisation of recently identiﬁed Ectocarpus candidate
pathogen receptors We recently discovered in the Ec-
tocarpus genome two families of candidate pathogen
receptors that display unusual, if not unique, struc-
tural and evolutionary features [3]. The project in-
cludes the bioinformatic and experimental characteri-
sation of LRR- ROCO and NB-ARC-TPR genes in or-
der to reconstruct the history of these two gene families
at diﬀerent time scales. SAMS is a vibrant multidisci-
plinary research organisation with world class facilities,
and the student will work in close association with lead-
ing experts. He / she will acquire in-depth knowledge in
the burgeoning ﬁeld of algal host-parasite interactions,
whilst developing transferrable skills in biochemistry,
molecular biology, bioinformatics, science communica-
tion and project management.
Methodology Unique biological material, substantial
proteomics, transcriptomics and genomic data, and all
necessary molecular techniques are available at SAMS.
The PI recently secured NERC funding to generate aMay 1, 2012 EvolDir 23
comparative RNAseq analysis of disease susceptible and
disease resistant Ectocarpus. The project will involve a
few short research stays in the Roscoﬀ Marine Station,
where the student will be able to access unsurpassed
MALDI imaging facilities. The student will be encour-
aged to exploit these opportunities to develop his/her
own original lines of research.

Speciﬁcally, we hope to reveal how mt-nuclear in-
teractions contribute to phenotypic variation between
strains, identify patterns of organelle coevolution, and
map the genetic basis underlying these interactions.
Successful candidates should have a strong background
in genetics, microbiology, or evolutionary biology. Ex-
perience with (or a strong desire to learn) statistics
and bioinformatics is particularly beneﬁcial. Students

France Scope: Computational Biology - Bioinformatics
- Genomics - Molecular evolutionSupervisors: Eric TANNIER (INRIA)
eric.tannier@inria.fr Laurent GUEGUEN (Univer-
sity of Lyon 1) laurent.gueguen@univ-lyon1.fr
Funding: Three-year grant from the “investissement
d’avenir” programme, project ANCESTROME
The selected candidate will work in the LBBE lab,
which oﬀers a highly stimulating scientiﬁc environment.
It is located in Lyon, which is a beautiful, history rich,
lively city. The PhD student will interact with the
molecular evolution team, and be part of the ances-
trome project, involving also the ENS Paris, Institut
Pasteur, and ISEM in Montpellier.
Ph-D subject:
This subject aims at studying genome evolution, where
a genome is not only seen as a set of independent genes,
but also a structure, a functionning, a complex set of
interactions within an environment.
At many evolutionary scales (from recent evolution to
the origin of life), and for many living group (mam-
mals, plants, bacteria, as well as protists or yeasts), we
propose to establish the methodological bases for recon-
structing the genomes of extinct species, integrating a
wide range of data from extant ones, such as proximity
between genes, protein interactions, metabolic capaci-
ties, gene expression, regulations, or life history traits
of organisms, like longevity for animals, optimal growth
temperature for bacteria.
In the LBBE lab, we have developped methods to si-
multaneously reconstruct species and gene histories in-
tegrating sequence evolution, gene birth, duplication,
transfer and loss. These methods give a ﬁrst hint at
the gene content of ancestral species, but they do not
give information about the relationships between these
genes. Moreover, they assume every gene evolves in-
dependently from each other, while in reality the set
of genes is an evolving graph, because they are phys-
ically linked by they organization on chromosomes, or
because they are linked inside a functional network.
The selected candidate will have to explore the mathe-
matical and computational problems for detecting and
explicitely modeling the evolution of these relation-
ships. Then, the models will be added to the models of
gene evolution in order to build gene and species histo-
ries, integrating information from the evolving graphs.
All methods will be integrated in the Bio++ library,
which will help the integrative project and ensure
longevity of the codes. For parallel implementations,
it will be possible to use high perpormance computing
ressources, owned by the lab or borrowed to national
structures.26 EvolDir May 1, 2012
The models and algorithms will be applied to biological
data from all kingdoms of the living.
Requirements :
The ideal candidate has a good knowledge of molecular
evolution, and solid bases in algorithmics and probabil-
ity. She/he is familiar with bioinformatics and phylo-
genetic concepts. Last she/he is autonomous in C++
programming.

UNeuchatel EvolutionaryEcology
Sparrows
PhD Position in evolutionary ecology, University of
Neuch ˜Atel, Switzerland
A fully-funded 3-year PhD position is available in Fab-
rice Helfenstein’s lab at the University of Neuch ˜Atel,
Switzerland, to work on the causes and consequences
of oxidative stress in avian semen. The position and
research project are funded by the Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation.
Oxidative stress is pervasive and represents a major
selective pressure throughout the animal kingdom. In
particular, vertebrate spermatozoa are very suscepti-
ble to oxidative stress, which may aﬀect sperm perfor-
mance and male fertility. Oxidative processes are thus
hypothesised to have a profound impact on the devel-
opment of male reproductive strategies and antioxidant
allocation strategies in species where males face sperm
competition, the circumstance where sperm of two or
more males compete to fertilise the same batch of eggs.
This project will test whether antioxidant allocation
strategies underlie the development of male reproduc-
tive tactics in relation to social status as predicted by
sperm competition models. This goal will be achieved
using a combination of ﬁeld observations, ﬁeld experi-
ments and aviary experiments on house sparrows Passer
domesticus.
The ideal candidate is highly motivated and creative
with a keen interest in evolutionary questions. He/she
shows a capacity to work both independently and as a
team member and has excellent writing and communi-May 1, 2012 EvolDir 27
cation skills in English. She/he has a background in
evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and/or eco-
physiology. Previous experience with bird handling, lab
work, experimental design and/or statistics is not essen-
tial but desirable. A MSc (or equivalent) in Biology is
required. The successful applicant will be based at the
Institute of Biology, University of Neuch ˜Atel. This post
oﬀers opportunities to collaborate and interact with re-
searchers working in related and complementary ﬁelds
(http://www2.unine.ch/biol/page-7860 en.html ). Our
research groups are international and our working lan-
guage is English. Knowledge of French is useful, but
not essential. Neuch ˜Atel is an attractive city, situated
by a beautiful lake at the foot of the Jura mountains
and facing the Berner Oberland mountains. The city
provides plenty of opportunities for cultural activities
and sports and oﬀers a high quality of life. Its excel-
lent public transports make it easy to leave the city

species that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
lato complex. In Europe, certain Borrelia species ap-
pear to be speciﬁc for either bird or mammalian hosts.
This host-speciﬁcity of the bacteria is at odds with the
presumed generalist feeding habits of the tick vector,
Ixodes ricinus. The proposed thesis topic is this poten-
tial tick-pathogen conﬂict over host choice.
Job requirements: The position requires an indepen-
dent, highly motivated, enthusiastic, and scientiﬁcally
curious individual with a background in ecology, evo-
lutionary biology, immunology or related ﬁelds. Molec-
ular techniques, ﬁeld experience, and statistical data
analysis skills are all highly useful. The applicant must
have a Master’s degree. The position requires some
teaching of undergraduate biology labs.

Zurich EvolutionaryGenetics
SnowVoles
3-Year PhD position in the group of Dr. Erik Postma
at the University of Zurich, Switzerland
Individual-level causes and population-level conse-
quences of variation in ﬁtness in an alpine rodent
This PhD project, funded by the Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation, combines ideas and techniques from
the ﬁelds of population and quantitative genetics, evo-
lutionary biology and population ecology, and applies
them to long-term individual-based data for an isolated
snow vole population (Chionomys nivalis), located in
the Swiss Alps. In particular, we are interested in which
ecological and evolutionary processes are responsible for
the generation and maintenance of variation in body
size, reproductive success and lifespan, and how this
variation shapes population dynamics.
We are seeking somebody who is independent, creative
and highly motivated, with an interest in (quantitative
and population) genetics and (evolutionary and pop-
ulation) ecology. Our ideal candidate has no fear of
equations and statistics, but is not afraid to get his
or her hands dirty in the lab and the ﬁeld either. Al-
though experience with programming in R is not essen-
tial, the willingness to learn this is crucial. Fieldwork
takes place in rough terrain and is physically demand-
ing. The views are superb, however. Previous experi-
ence handling small mammals is not required.
We are working together closely with the group of Prof.
Lukas Keller, as well as several other groups within our
institute ( www.ieu.uzh.ch ). This oﬀers a stimulating
and social working environment and excellent facilities
(including a well-equipped molecular lab). The student
will participate in the PhD program in evolutionary bi-
ology of the University of Zurich.
Although the preferred starting date is June 1 2012, the
actual starting date is negotiable.
Zurich consistently ranks amongst the cities with the
highest quality of life. While it oﬀers all the pleasures
of living in a bigger city, thanks to its central location
and excellent public transport system, it is extremely30 EvolDir May 1, 2012
easy to get out of the city and head for the mountains.
Applicants should have an MSc (or equivalent) in a rele-
vant ﬁeld. Applications should include 1) a cover letter,
including a brief description of what you have to oﬀer to
the project and our group, and what you hope to get
back in return, 2) a detailed curriculum vitae, 3) the
contact details of two references and 4) a 1-page sum-
mary of your MSc or undergraduate work. This should
be sent as a single .pdf ﬁle to erik.postma@ieu.uzh.ch
Review of applications starts on 23 April 2012, but can-didates are considered until the position is ﬁlled.

CharlesDarwinFoundation
ProgramDirector
Dear Friends & Colleagues,
the Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Is-
lands continues to build a team for transforming and
revitalizing the organisation. I am looking for a Pro-
gram Director to join me in my work.
The Program Director will be: - Primarily responsible
for managing and developing the portfolio of scientiﬁc
project of the Charles Darwin Research Station in the
Galapagos Islands, and the teams of scientists that are
behind these projects. - Work closely with the organi-
zation’s Board and Program Committee to ensure the
organization sticks to its medium and longer-term sci-
ence priorities. - Work and interact with local pub-
lic institutions (Galapagos National Park, Government
Council, Ministries).Applicants need to have a PhD and be ﬂuent in Span-
ish. For more details, please see the attached terms
of reference. These were written with very ambitious
requirements, e.g. we even included know-how and in-
volvement in managing the operations / administration
of the research station. These ToR are in many ways
a wish-list, and I have an open mind about applicants
(being myself someone who does not ﬁt the conventional
proﬁle for my position). One of the key tasks for the
Program Director will be to help make this organization
be relevant and impactful.
We are seeking applications by April 15th, although
applications that come in a few days later will still be
considered by the small committee that we have formed
to select the ﬁnal candidate (please check with me for
exact dates). Salary and other details are negotiable.
The position should be ﬁlled as soon as possible, al-
though we do understand that international applicants
need some extra lead time for relocating. It is impor-
tant that the applicant comes with the idea in mind to
stay in this position for three years or more, as we need
continuity and stability.
Please do pass on this email to anyone who you think
might be interest in this position. When advertising the
position for my Executive PA I experienced the power
of our Foundation’s network, where forwarded emails
lead to high calibre candidates from around the world
applying for the job. I am also happy for anyone who
would like to post this on Facebook and other network-
ing sites.
The Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Is-
lands was set up in 1959, following a scientiﬁc ex-
pedition of IUCN, UNESCO and the Government of
Ecuador. In 1964, the Charles Darwin Research Station
was inaugurated and it has since then seen several gen-
erations of scientists, scholarship students, volunteers
and employees pass through its doors. Our mission is
to provide science for the conservation of the Galapa-
gos Islands, an archipelago that to this day remains the
world’s most pristine tropical archipelago with World
Natural Heritage Site status. The Galapagos Islands
have appr. 25,000 residents. Ecuador is a stunning
country and it is itself undergoing a transformation.
There could probably not be a more exciting time to
join our eﬀorts out here in the middle of the Paciﬁc
Ocean.
Do not hesitate to email me if you have any speciﬁc
questions.

A full-time Research Technician position is available in
the Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liv-
erpool, UK
A research technician post is available starting on June
1, 2012 to work on dynamics of within- and between-
species parasite transmission in a natural small mam-
mal community in the UK. This will be part of a
NERC funded grant led by Andy Fenton (University of
Liverpool), Amy Pedersen (University of Edinburgh)
and Owen Petchey (University of Zurich) to quantify
host species contributions to parasite transmission and
persistence across a diverse, natural multi-host-multi-
parasite community. This work will involve a combina-
tion of ﬁeldwork (small mammal trapping), large-scale
ecological manipulation experiments and laboratory as-
says.
The main role of the research technician post is to un-
dertake and assist with the planning of small mammal
trapping at our ﬁeld sites on the Wirral, record data on
each mouse caught and take blood and faecal samples.
In addition the technician will be involved in the main-
tenance of sampling equipment, ﬁeld-measuring equip-
ment, sample storage and transportation etc. as well as
analysing faecal and blood samples in the lab to iden-
tify the parasites within them. This will lead to the
compilation of a unique and extensive database on the
parasite communities of these wild rodents.
The technician will work closely with, and receive train-
ing from, a senior technician (Grade 6), and be involved
with the supervision of a number of undergraduate vol-
unteer workers throughout the summer months. In ad-
dition, the technican will be part of a wider team in-
volving the PIs on the project and a Post-Doctoral re-
searcher, all of whom will be part of the trapping and
data collection team.
The post will be for up to 35 months and will be
based within the lab of Andy Fenton at the Institute
of Integrative Biology, at the University of Liverpool,
and will be fully integrated within the wider research
team from the Universities of Edinburgh and Zurich.

Bad interval Bottleneck
Dear List:
I am having a problem executing program BOTTLE-
NECK (Cornuet and Luikart 1997). For one very rich
microsatellite locus, the program is unable to get past
calculation of He. For the calculation of Heq, it tries
various values of theta for likelihood, which for this
locus hasn’t exceeded about 0.040. This apparently
prompts it to try again, giving the following error mes-
sage: “Maybe a bad interval. Be patient, I try again
[sic] ...” It has tried thousands of times over about four
days and always fails. The same locus in another pop-
ulation worked ﬁne. I am using the TPM model, the
variance set at 12, proportion of SMM in TPM is 90,and 1000 iterations. There are about 450 individuals
in this population, about 250 in the population where
this locus had no problems. Any suggestions? Is there
a hard-coded minimum likelihood value that I could re-
lax? Should I try more iterations? Based on Figure 2
in Luikart and Cornuet and the richness of this allele
(ks) perhaps I need to have it exploring larger values of
theta (it currently usually tries between 100 and 1000)?

Dear Colleagues,
The Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey is entering its
fourth ﬁeld season, now with demographic data and
seed collections from over 300 populations across Eu-
rope and North America! This year we are looking for
(i) new collaborators to collect data and seeds from
poorly-sampled areas (see below), and (ii) returning
collaborators to contribute to a temporal dimension by
resampling populations from previous years.
In addition to collecting valuable ﬁeld data on the de-
mography, performance, abundance and distribution
of Alliaria petiolata (Garlic Mustard) across its entire
global distribution, we are developing genetic resources
(e.g. immortal inbred lines and recombinant inbred
lines) appropriate for studying a variety of evolutionary
phenomena, including local adaptation to climate, the
role of migration vs. de novo mutation in contemporary
evolution, evolution of herbivore resistance chemistry,
phylogeography, and the genetic basis of invasiveness.
Participation involves a very basic protocol that stan-
dardizes sampling across sites, and takes place in late
spring/early summer. The estimated duration of sam-
pling for a team of two people is 3-6 hours per popula-
tion.
Participation is open to anyone and those who con-
tribute will have the opportunity to participate in
manuscripts resulting from the work and access to
data and seed resources prior to their release to the
general scientiﬁc community. Please use this web-
site to sign-up for the 2012 ﬁeld season: http://-

Comments for ARWallace website
Contribute to “The Alfred Russel Wallace Page” Web-
site
Some years ago I solicited what I termed “commen-
taries” for a feature on my “Alfred Russel Wallace
Page” website ( http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/-
index1.htm ), transcriptions of Wallace publications.
Almost all of Wallace’s 1000+ published works are
now to be found there ( http://people.wku.edu/-
charles.smith/wallace/writings.htm ), and I am hoping
additional parties might be interested in contributing
one or more such “commentaries” to this array. These
typically have been 250 to 350 words in length, and
would feature your slant on why a particular Wallace ar-
ticle remains of interest - historically and/or currently.
A good example may be found at the end of: http://-
people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S184.htm .
It is not important that you may not consider yourself
a “Wallace expert,” and in fact most of those who have
contributed in the past are not. If you do not wish to
wade through the entire list of Wallace’s publications to
choose a subject writing, I can suggest a handful of ar-
ticles (many quite short) that might be of most interest
to you.
2013 is the one hundredth anniversary of Wallace’sdeath, and some dozen book projects and con-
ferences are in preparation/planning accordingly.
If you feel you might be interested in contribut-
ing to my site (and in turn to the anniversary
celebration), please contact me for more details at:

Commercial antibody suggestions
I am considering having antibodies made for a protein
that I’ve been working on, Malic enzyme, a metabolic
enzyme. Does anyone have experiences, positive or neg-
ative, they can share about the various companies of-
fering antibody production services? Speciﬁcally, I’ve
been looking at Abmart, a company that oﬀers to go
from a text ﬁle of the amino acid sequence to a set of
monoclonal antibodies.

Hello Evoldir community–
I’m sorry to say that I got the date wrong in the last
announcement. The correct date is Monday, April 30th.
Here is the correct announcement:
“Simulating evolution with in silico models of protein
thermodynamics” Richard Goldstein (National Insti-
tute for Medical Research, London)May 1, 2012 EvolDir 49
Many of the most basic issues of protein evolution are
diﬃcult to determine from the relationship between ex-
istent protein sequences. We would ideally like to anal-
yse the complete evolutionary record: what mutations
were attempted when in what lineage, which ones were
deleterious or advantageous and by how much, which
ones were accepted, and how these substitutions af-
fected further mutations and the overall evolution of
protein properties. In the absence of available biolog-
ical data, we can create our own - simulate protein
evolution in silico, such as in our work modelling how
proteins would evolve given their need to be thermody-
namically stable. These simulations allow us to explore
a range of phenomena and develop a conceptual frame-
work that tells us which questions may be interesting
and important to consider in real proteins. Such simula-
tions can also illuminate which conditions are necessary
and/or suﬃcient to explain observed protein character-
istics. We consider how evolution of protein thermosta-
bility explains why proteins are generally marginally

CultivatedSpecies GeneticVariation
Dear evoldir members,
We have characterized and isolated nuclear microsatel-
lite loci from enriched libaries for Aloe vera, a widely
cultivated species. We have tested polymorphism How-
ever, none of the 30 microsatellite tested showed poly-
morphism in samples from naturalized and cultivated
populations from diﬀerent islands and archipelagosfrom Macaronesian, and other localities. We have de-
tected polymorphism in samples of other species of Aloe
from the North of Africa. Have any body developed
polimorphic microsatellites for this species?, Have any
body found this absence of genetic diversity in a culti-
vated species?.
Thank in advance,

DNA from museum specimens
Dear EvoLDir Members:
I am currently carrying out some aDNA analyses on
bird toe pads from museum specimens aged between
50 and 150 years. Speciﬁcally, I am going to amplify
200 bp long fragments of the mitochondrial DNA Con-
trol Region. I would appreciate very much to get some
indications and suggestions with reference to:
- the removal of potential inhibitors of the PCR such as
gasoline, butane, formalin, arsenic powder: is it advis-
able to wash the samples with ethanol before extraction
to get rid of them? - the advisability of grinding the
samples into as much tiny as possible pieces in order
to maximize the surface contact area and so the ac-
tion of lysis solution and proteinase K: isn’t it risky
because of the possible spreading of residual inhibitors
to the whole sample? - the feasibility of using betaine,
BSA and Exonuclease III to improve PCR ampliﬁca-
tion: what about their amount provided a ﬁnal reaction
volume of 50 microliters?
Thanks

Evolution 7 videos
Dear all,
Now that we have recently published the seventh
and last movie of our project, I would like to tell
you about the short movies about evolutionary re-
search which Yannick Mah´ e and I have published
on our website <http://www.evolution-of-life.com/ >
and our youtube channel <http://www.youtube.com/-
user/evolutionoﬂife09/videos >.
The last one of the movies (about the evolution of lac-
tase persistence, starring Joachim Burger and Sarah
Tishkoﬀ) was just uploaded a few days ago (Good Milk
/ Bad Milk <http://www.evolution-of-life.com/en/-observe/video/ﬁche/good-milk-bad-milk.html >).
The topics of the other movies are:
1. antibiotics resistance (The bacteria

Each of the movies was made by a diﬀerent team of
people, and so they will look and sound quite diﬀerent.
“The bacteria resist”, “Darwin on the evolution trail”
and “O as origin” are completely animated, whereas the
other movies are mostly documentaries. All of them are
less than 10 minutes long.
All movies are available in English, French and Ger-
man (mostly dubbed, the last movie currently has sub-
titles only). On our youtube channel, there are a few
movies with Rumanian and Spanish subtitles as well,
seehttp://www.youtube.com/user/evolutionoﬂife09/-
videos .
Our project is mainly funded by the Volkswagen Foun-
dation in Germany as part of their evolutionary biology
program. We won several awards with the project, most
importantly the Medea award for European collabora-
tions, see http://evolution-of-life.blogspot.com/2010/-
12/medea-european-collaboration-award-2010.html
We hope that our movies will be useful for you if you
are teaching evolution classes to high school students,
undergrads, lay audiences etc. Feedback is welcome, of
course!

I am interested in how professors across the world teach
a course on evolutionary biology at the undergraduate
level. In particular, I am interested in 1) who you are;
2) if I can contact you (by email) and ask you some
questions about how you teach; 3) whether you use
a textbook and if you do, which one you use; and 4)
whether the course is required or not for a major in
biology. Please respond to

Genbank submission instructions
I thought folks might ﬁnd the following site useful. It
has detailed instructions on submitting phylogenetic or
phylogeographic datasets to GenBank, as well as brief
details on Dryad and TreeBase. Essentially, for Gen-
Bank it describes a process for entering most of the in-
formation GenBank needs in the submission ﬁle rather
than entering those detail in sequin.

Insect tissue storageOther: storage of insect tissue for ﬂow cytometry
Dear All,
I am planning to apply ﬂow cytometry to tissue sam-
ples from several sexual and asexual insect (Microco-
ryphia, jumping bristletails) species. I understand that
it is common to use fresh material for these measure-
ments. However, as these insects are hard to keep in
husbandry and ﬁeldwork is often unpredictable, I would
like to preserve samples both over the short (for bet-
ter streamlining my workﬂow) and the long term (extra
samples as backup).
Does anyone have experience with storage of insect tis-
sue for use in ﬂow cytometry? Ideally, the method
should (1) be applicable in the ﬁeld (potentially com-
bined with later refrigeration), (2) allow for high-
quality ﬂow cytometry measurement even after one year
or more, and (3) not degrade DNA.
I know my demands are quite high; I would be very
grateful for any suggestion.
Kind regards,

Introns exons videos
Introns and Exons
The discovery of introns in 1977 led to numerous
hypotheses on their origin. As our knowledge in-
creased many of these fell by the wayside. Given
the now narrow ﬁeld of contenders, a historical
account of ideas leading up to modern perceptions
would seem timely. Thus, extending the previous
three series of videos on Evolutionary Principles,
Natural Selection, and Blending Inheritance, a fourth
series on Introns and Exons is now launched. As
before, the new series follows the style of Salman
Khan’s highly successful “Khan Academy” ( http://-

Journal Society Coevolution
Dear All,
A few colleagues and I have discussed for some time
the possibility of establishing a Society of Coevolution
and launching a Journal of Coevolution. We thought it
appropriate to solicit feedback from EvolDir readers.
1) Society of Coevolution: I will create a web page for
you to register your interest as a founding member of
the society. Will announce the URL in a few days.
2) Attached below is a draft proposal for Journal of Co-
evolution. I should greatly appreciate your feedback.
Proposal for Journal of Coevolution
Title Journal of Coevolution
Background 1) There is no journal that explicitly cover
the area of coevolution or molecular coevolution. 2)
Research publications on coevolution is scattered over
many journals. However, these publications all share
a set of distinctive features that set them apart from
other evolutionary studies. There is a strong need
for coevolutionary research to have its own publica-
tion venue. 3) Recent availability of high-throughput
data and their associated databases have created an
unprecedented opportunities for coevolutionary stud-
ies, which include receptor-ligand coevolution, codon-
anticodon coevolution, bacteriophage-bacterial host co-
evolution, etc. 4) Organismal coevolution such as host-
parasite coevolution and predator- prey coevolution not
only remain academically strong, but also invigorated
by their molecular details. 5) Granting agencies are re-
ceiving more and more grant applications in the area of
molecular coevolution
Aims and Scope The journal will cover all research top-
ics elucidating the coevolution of two or more biological
entities. It will include two sections:
1) Molecular coevolution section including, but not
limited to, research ﬁelds such as receptor-ligand co-
evolution, codon-anticodon coevolution, bacteriophage-
bacterial host coevolution, virus-host resistance coevo-
lution. 2) Organismal coevolution section including,
but not limited to, research ﬁelds such as host-parasite
coevolution, predator-prey coevolution, culture-human
coevolution.There has been no journal that explicitly cover the
area of coevolution or molecular coevolution. There
has been no journal that has a section that explicitly
cover the area of coevolution or molecular coevolution.
Editorial Structure 1) Two co-chief editors, one for the
molecular coevolution section and the other for the or-
ganismal coevolution section. 2) A sets of six associate
editors covering various aspects of coevolutionary stud-
ies. 3) An editorial board of about 20 members 4) A
managing editor who will check the format and com-
pleteness of the submitted manuscript.

Journal Society Coevolution
clariﬁcation
Dear All,
I received many comments and suggestions on the draft
proposal for Journal of Coevolution. Many are easily
accommodated (e.g., adding plant-pollinator coevolu-
tion, sexual conﬂict and male-female coevolution, etc.,
etc.), but two issues may beneﬁt from more feedback
from the EvolDir community.
1. Should studies on co-speciation be included in a
Journal of Coevolution?
Coevolution: evolutionary changes in Partner X leads
to diﬀerential ﬁtness among individuals of Partner Y.
The latter then evolves in response to the selection forceMay 1, 2012 EvolDir 53
imposed by the former, and vice versa.
Co-speciation: evolutionary changes (e.g., measured by
genetic divergence) in Partner X is induced by the evo-
lutionary changes in Partner Y, with the consequent
correlated changes leading to phylogenetic concordance
between the two partners. It is better to illustrate
this with an example of chewing lice-pocket gopher
co-speciation. When gopher populations become frag-
mented and genetically diverged, the chewing lice car-
ried on them become fragmented and genetically di-
verged as well, leading to phylogenetic concordance be-
tween the lice and the gopher. The population frag-
mentation of chewing lice is induced by the population
fragmentation of the gophers, but not vice versa.
However, co-speciation could lead to coevolution. For
example, if some gopher species become so clean that
there is nothing in their hair for the lice to chew, then it
would be beneﬁcial the chronically hungry lice to evolve
the ability to suck blood. If the gophers infested by
the blood-sucking lice then evolved something in their
blood that is toxic to the lice, then we have a bona ﬁde
case of coevolution.
For this reason, it would seem to make sense for a Jour-
nal of Coevolution to include studies on co-speciation
because co-speciating partners are expected to have a
high likelihood to coevolve.
One may consider the gopher-lice example as analogous
to the fragmentation of land masses and the associated
fragmentation of biota carried on them. Should such
biogeographic patterns induced by continental move-
ment be included in a Journal of Coevolution?
The answer is no, because the continent and the biota
are not expected to have a high likelihood to coevolve.
2. Why should culture-human coevolution be included
in a biological journal?
1) Culture-human interactions urgently need more
studies from a biological perspective. Dramatically
diﬀerent cultures, religions, and social systems have
evolved in diﬀerent regions, and one naturally asks why
there are so much diﬀerences. From a social biogeo-
graphic point of view, there are two possible explana-
tions for why Culture A found in Area A is not found
in Area B where you ﬁnd Culture B instead. First,
Culture A might just be “bad” for people in Area B.
Second, Culture A is “ﬁtter” than Culture B but has
never got a chance to be practised by people in Area B.
Western politicians never consider the ﬁrst possibility,
and always insist that a single Culture A be brought to
all regions to be practised. Similarly, advocates of some
religions insist that their religions should be practisedeverywhere by all people in the world. They might well
be right, but it would seem reasonable to examine the
ﬁrst possibility.
2) Culture-human do coevolve. A change in culture
intuitively would lead to diﬀerential ﬁtness among us
(e.g., the increased cultural sympathy for the sick has
substantially increased the ﬁtness of carriers of certain
genetic diseases), and changing genetic composition of
human societies will have diﬀerential impact on diﬀer-
ent cultures.
I should appreciate your opinion, either to me or to
EvolDir.

Next phyloseminar talk: “Simulating evolution with
in silico models of protein thermodynamics” Richard
Goldstein (National Institute for Medical Research,
London)
Many of the most basic issues of protein evolution are
diﬃcult to determine from the relationship between ex-
istent protein sequences. We would ideally like to anal-
yse the complete evolutionary record: what mutations
were attempted when in what lineage, which ones were
deleterious or advantageous and by how much, which
ones were accepted, and how these substitutions af-
fected further mutations and the overall evolution of
protein properties. In the absence of available biolog-
ical data, we can create our own - simulate protein
evolution in silico, such as in our work modelling how
proteins would evolve given their need to be thermody-
namically stable. These simulations allow us to explore
a range of phenomena and develop a conceptual frame-
work that tells us which questions may be interestingand important to consider in real proteins. Such simula-
tions can also illuminate which conditions are necessary
and/or suﬃcient to explain observed protein character-
istics. We consider how evolution of protein thermosta-
bility explains why proteins are generally marginally
stable, why eukaryotes may have more disordered pro-
teins than prokaryotes, and what the consequences of
this are for biochemical networks. We also consider
how various locations in a protein can co-evolve, and
how this can inform the next generation of substitution
models.

Physicians with EvolutionPhD
Evoldir:
As part of a NESCent-funded working group ’Infus-
ing Evolutionary Thinking into Medical Education’, we
are looking for people with a PhD in evolutionary bi-
ology/biological anthropologywho are now practicing
physicians/medical doctors or in training.
If you know of any such folk, please ask
them to email one of us (a.read@psu.edu OR
g.r.bentley@durham.ac.uk). If you have lost con-
tact, please email their name and any contact details
as you have (which medical school, roughly when they
started), and we’ll try to track them down. We are
interested in all ages, all countries, and any area of
evolutionary studies.
At this point we just want to discuss our working group
topic with medical trainees and professionals who also
have advanced evolutionary research training. But we
might also try to grow this into an ongoing network to
further broader professional interests.

Robert Sokal has passed away
We are sad to report that Distinguished Professor
Emeritus Robert R. Sokal passed away in Stony Brook
on Monday, April 9, 2012 at the age of 86. Prof. Sokal
was a founding member of the Department of Ecology
and Evolution at Stony Brook University, co-founder
of the methodological school of Numerical Taxonomy,
and the principle investigator for major research pro-
grams in the spatial variation of insects and humans
and the evolutionary response to selection in insects.
He supervised the training of numerous Ph.D. students
and taught biometry to a much larger number. He was
a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the
USA and received many other honors during his re-
markable career. We in the Department of Ecology
and Evolution at Stony Brook will miss his insights,
support, and friendship.
Prof. Sokal was born into a middle class Jewish fam-
ily on January 13, 1926 in Vienna, Austria, the only
child of Klara and Siegfried Sokal. He ﬂed the loom-
ing Nazi menace with his family in 1938 to Shanghai,
China, which became the refuge for tens of thousands ofEuropean Jews during World War II. Robert attended
secondary school and college in Shanghai, earning his
B.S. degree in Biology from St. John’s University in
1947. There he also met a young Chinese student,
Julie Chenchu Yang, who became his wife and lifelong
love. A book entitled Letzte Zuﬂucht Schanghai (Final
Refuge Shanghai) by Stefan Schomann (2008) in Ger-
man and translated into Chinese chronicled Robert’s
ﬂight from Vienna, his family’s refuge in Shanghai, and
the start of his life with Julie, before he came to the
United States for his graduate education.
Prof. Sokal received his graduate training at the Uni-
versity of Chicago, where he earned his Ph.D. in Zo-
ology in 1952 under the direction of entomologist Al-
fred E. Emerson and was strongly inﬂuenced by Sewall
Wright. He joined the Entomology Department at the
University of Kansas in 1951 as an instructor, and rose
rapidly through the academic ranks to Professor of Sta-
tistical Biology in 1961. He was recruited by Lawrence
B. Slobodkin to the ﬂedgling Department of Ecology
and Evolution at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook in 1968, where he spent the remainder of
his career.
Prof. Sokal’s scientiﬁc publications span a broad range
of subjects and seven decades. He published major
papers in ecology, evolution, anthropology, geography,
statistics, and of course systematics. His papers ap-
peared in Science, Nature, PNAS USA, and many of
the best specialty journals in ecology, evolution, sys-
tematics, anthropology, and statistics. He is probably
best known to evolutionary biologists and ecologists for
his Biometry textbook with F. James Rohlf, the fourth
edition of which he completed less than a year before
his death. A recent search of Google Scholar indicated
that the third edition of Biometry had been cited 19,851
times. Prof. Sokal is also well known as the co-founder
of Numerical Taxonomy with Peter H. A. Sneath in
1963. This work promoted digital methods for clas-
siﬁcation and was controversial both because it advo-
cated abandonment of traditional evolutionary system-
atics and led to the debate between the advocates of
phenetic and cladistic methods. Regardless, it is unde-
niable that Prof. Sokal pioneered the use of rigorous,
objective statistical methods and the employment of
computers in systematics. Prof. Sokal started his ca-
reer with dissertation research on patterns of geograph-
ical variation in Pemphigus aphids. Later, he initiated
research on the evolutionary response to selection in
laboratory populations of Tribolium beetles and house
ﬂies. His last major empirical project, which he pur-
sued for more than two decades, focused on analysis of
patterns of spatial variation in human populations for
a variety of traits and the development of new methods56 EvolDir May 1, 2012
for these analyses. Prof. Sokal published 12 books (5
translated) and 206 articles, and his publications have
been cited tens of thousands of times.
Prof. Sokal came to Stony Brook University as a Pro-
fessor in 1968. He was named Leading Professor in
1972 and Distinguished Professor in 1991. He retired
in 1995 and became a very active Distinguished Pro-
fessor Emeritus. He served as the Chair and Grad-
uate Program Director of the Department of Ecology
and Evolution at Stony Brook University from 1980 to
1983 and as Vice Provost for Research and Graduate
Studies from 1981 to 82. He remained very active in
scientiﬁc research, the Department of Ecology and Evo-
lution, university aﬀairs, and the National Academy of
Sciences, even attending departmental colloquia until
the last year of his life, when his declining health pre-
cluded it.
Prof. Sokal also served in many other prestigious capac-

RogueTaxa Bootstraps
Dear EvolDir members,
the consensus tree of a set of bootstrap trees can fre-
quently exhibit poor resolution or sub-optimal branch
support because of unstable taxa (also referred to as
rogue taxa). Analogously, rogue taxa may also aﬀect
branch support values for maximum likelihood trees.
Recently, we made available a web-service, that al-
lows to identify rogue taxa in a set of bootstrap trees.
Optionally, if also a single best-known tree (under
ML/MP) is provided, our algorithm can identify rogue
taxa with respect to the branch support values drawn
onto this tree (for both cases the set of rogue taxa is
often similar, but not necessarily identical).
In other words, for consensus trees we can say that
our algorithm produces a result that is a compromisebetween a potentially poorly resolved/supported con-
sensus tree and a maximum agreement sub-tree (that
often only comprises few taxa).
The URL to our server is http://exelixis-lab.org/-
roguenarok.html Using the web-interface, you can com-
pare the results of various rogue taxon searches (includ-
ing stability measures such as the taxonomic instability
index and the leaf stability index). Finally, the websites
integrates a tree viewer that can be used to visualize
your consensus tree/best-known tree before and after
removing various sets of rogue taxa.
Feedback and comments are most welcome, preferably
via the RAxML google group.

Snake primers
Dear Evoldir members,
I would like to amplify a DNA mitochondrial fraction
(maybe COI, 16S rDNA or 12S rDNA) from snakes.
The samples that I have are museum specimens con-
taminated with human DNA and therefore I require
primers that will only amplify reptile DNA to avoid
contamination.
Thanks and best regards Michael Jowers

A postdoctoral research position is available in the Cen-
tre for Macroevolution and Macroecology in the Evo-
lution, Ecology and Genetics Division of the Research
School of Biological Sciences at the Australian National
University in Canberra. ANU is the top research insti-
tution in Australia, and ranks in the top 30 universities
in the world. It provides an excellent research environ-
ment and career opportunities for researchers.
DIVERSIFICATION OF A HOTSPOT FLORA
The origins of biodiversity hotspots are still in-
completely understood, particularly those located in
Mediterranean-climate regions. This includes Aus-
tralia’s southwest, where there are over 7000 plant
species, half of which are endemic. We are using phy-
logenetic, geographic and ecological data to investigate
the spectacular diversity of southwest Australia, focus-
ing on the massive radiation of the Proteaceae fam-
ily as a case study. We are testing general expla-
nations of diversity including models based on clade
age, diversiﬁcation rates, and ecological carrying ca-
pacity, as well as hypotheses more speciﬁc to the south-
west. The postdoctoral researcher will be responsible
for constructing large species-level molecular phyloge-
nies, assembling databases of species geographic dis-
tributions and ecological traits, then using these to
analyse patterns and test models of diversity.There is
plenty of scope for development of novel and innovative
analytical approaches. See http://jobs.anu.edu.au/-

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF PATTERNS OF

Does the tempo and mode of evolution increase in par-
ticular times, places or lineages? Why are some lin-
eages more or less successful over evolutionary time?
Does evolution result in traits that increase the gener-
ation of variation or the eﬃciency of selection? The
emphasis of this research program is to frame ques-
tions such as these in a way that allows them to be
tested and applied to important case studies. The post-
doc will develop and extend a broad-scale compara-
tive approach to these questions, in particular mak-
ing use of the analysis of large molecular phylogenies
and patterns of molecular evolution. There is consid-
erable scope for the postdoc to develop innovative and

Job description
Funding body: NERC Hours: Full time Start date:
09/2012 Duration: 3 years Supervisor: Prof Gra-
ham Stone Informal enquiries: Prof Graham Stone
(graham.stone@ed.ac.uk) and Dr Konrad Lohse (Kon-
rad.lohse@ed.ac.uk).
Job Proﬁle
The post is funded as part of a NERC-funded project
(NE/J010499) titled “Genomic approaches to inference
of population history and multispecies community as-
sembly”, with PI’s Graham Stone and Konrad Lohse
(Edinburgh University) and James Cook (Reading Uni-
versity). The project combines development of new the-
ory (PRDA) with generation and processing of genomic
data for appropriate target species (project-dedicated
Bioinformatician and NERC Genepool) to test alter-
native models for the history of assembly of biological
communities. By design, all of the target species are
wasps, which have haploid males - signiﬁcantly simpli-
fying data processing and analysis.
You will develop coalescent theory for non-equilibrium
models of population structure. The main goal of the
project is to devise analytical tools (both numerical
likelihood and Approximate Bayesian Computation) for
the analysis of genomic data. A particular focus is
to ﬁnd ways to jointly utilize information contained in
the distribution of genealogies (multilocus-type meth-
ods, see Lohse et al. 2011) with information contained
in patterns of linkage disequilibrium. A second aim is
to develop hierarchical models that allow the analysis
of multispecies data under complex historical scenar-
ios (see Stone et al. 2012 and Wen et al. 2011). You
will beneﬁt from the expertise of project partners Prof
Nick Barton (Institute of Science and Technology Aus-
tria) and Prof Mike Hickerson (Queens College - City
University of New York) in these areas.
The new inference methods will be tested on both sim-
ulated data and de novo genome assemblies from insectMay 1, 2012 EvolDir 63
host and parasitoid species (multiple individuals and
populations sampled from a total of 20 target species)
in two natural communities (Oak gallwasps and their
natural enemies in Europe; ﬁgwasps and their natural
enemies in eastern Australia). Comparisons of popu-
lation histories across species and trophic levels will in
turn be used to evaluate alternative models of commu-
nity assembly (see Stone et al. 2012).
The hi-throughput sequence data will be assembled and
prepared for population genetic analysis by a project-
dedicated bioinformatician. The post includes some
provision for training in genomic informatics with the
NERC Genepool.

Applications are invited for a post doctoral fellowship
position available April 2012 in a Genomics Research
and Development Initiative (GRDI) project at the
PHACs Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses, Guelph,
Ontario, Canada. Fellowships are awarded initially for
one year with the possibility of renewal for a second
year.
The project is focused on development of high res-
olution molecular subtyping of the highly clonal en-
teric pathogen, Salmonella Enteritidis. The approach
is to use whole genome sequencing to identify variably
present or absent loci or SNPs that will provide highly
discriminatory identiﬁcation of related and unrelated
strains.
With open whole genome sequences of numerous se-
lected strains now available, the candidate will under-

Leipzig MPI ComputBiol
- Postdoctoral position in computational/evolutionary
biology -
There is an opening for a post-doctoral researcher with
a strong academic background to pursue a research
project in our group at the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology (Department of Evolution-
ary Genetics). One main aim in the laboratory is the
characterization of genes whose protein functions re-
quire the trace element selenium. These genes incor-
porate selenium in the form of selenocysteine, the 21st
amino acid in the genetic code, and are known as se-
lenoprotein genes.
The researcher will develop computational methods to
annotate selenoprotein genes and their regulatory re-
gions in selected species. The goal is to develop compar-
ative annotation tools that incorporate the uncertainty
of (divergent) alignments into the annotation process.
The researcher will also integrate variation data from
large resequencing studies in the lab to these annota-
tions. We will incorporate these results into SelenoDB
(www.selenodb.org ) to allow comprehensive evolution-
ary analysis of selenium-dependent genes within andbetween species. In addition, ample opportunities for
the analysis of primate genomes in collaboration with
other groups in the Department will exist.
We are seeking a motivated, well-organized and creative
person. Knowledge of Hidden Markov Models, C and
Perl programming languages and SQL would be advan-
tageous.
The researcher will receive a payment according to Max
Planck Institute rates. The working environment of the
institute is English-speaking, and the members consti-
tute a highly international group. The institute is in
Leipzig, a pleasant city of 500,000 inhabitants situated
two hours from Berlin and three hours from Prague.
Applicants should send their CV, transcripts and name
and address of two references (in PDF format) to Dr.

ism which allows for characterization of tumor and host
cells during each phase of tumor evolution.
The ideal applicant is interesting in utilizing techniques
commonly applied to evolutionary biology in the setting
of cancer. The relevance of this approach can be ap-
preciated when considering the thousands of mutations
found in a typical tumor, and we are interested in un-
derstanding the mechanistic basis of variant generation
and selection pressures in the rapidly changing tumor
microenvironment. We are particularly interested inMay 1, 2012 EvolDir 67
understanding how the host genetic background inter-
acts with DNA/RNA variants in the tumor cell itself.
Our techniques include high throughput whole genome,
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, along with chemical biology
techniques.
The position will oﬀer the opportunity for extensive
scientiﬁc collaborations across diverse disciplines in a
highly stimulating, creative environment. No back-
ground in cancer biology is necessary or expected, as
the goal is to approach questions in cancer biology from
a novel perspective.

Smith College invites applications for a full-time post-
doctoral research position focusing on genome evolution
in the ciliate Chilodonella uncinata. The initial ap-
pointment is for one year, with the possibility of extend-
ing for additional years. The position will be housed in
Professor Laura Katz’s laboratory in the Department
of Biological Sciences ( http://www.science.smith.edu/-
departments/Biology/lkatz/Research.htm ); questions
should be directed to lkatz@smith.edu.
An ideal candidate will: 1) be a productive researcher
with interests in genome evolution in microorganisms;
2) have experience in both molecular biology and bioin-
formatics, 3) have excellent communication and inter-
personal skills; and 4) be interested in collaboratingwith graduate and undergraduate students in the lab-
oratory.
The goals of the project are to characterize the distinc-
tions between germline and somatic genomes within C.
uncinata, and to interpret the resulting data in an evo-
lutionary and phylogenetic context. Ciliates are deﬁned
by the presence of two distinct genomes - the -germline’
micronuclear and -somatic’ macronuclear - within each
cell. Chilodonella uncinata provides an ideal model for
this study as its macronuclear genome is highly pro-
cessed yielding a streamlined genome with millions of
gene-sized chromosomes (i.e. most non-protein-coding
sequences are eliminated). Speciﬁc hypotheses focus on
the role of alternative processing of micronuclear loci in
generating macronuclear protein family diversity, the
relationship between macronuclear copy number and
expression level, and the varying patterns of molecu-
lar evolution between germline and somatic genomes.
To apply, submit application at http://jobs.smith.edu

Post-doctoral opportunity in “Mathematical Modeling
of Insect Invasion Dynamics, as informed by Pathosys-
tem Genomics Data”
Context
Insect invasions are characterized by systematic
changes in population numbers over time and space
as insects reproduce and disperse into new host ter-
ritory. The mountain pine beetle in North America
is a system where an indigenous species has recently
increased its range to threaten novel host species. Al-
though the population dynamics of the natural system
within its previous host range (British Columbia, W.
of the Rocky Mountains) is relatively well-researched,70 EvolDir May 1, 2012
there is tremendous uncertainty within the new host
range (Alberta, E. of the Rocky Mountains) on key pa-
rameters, including beetle dispersal rates, host suitabil-
ity, host vigor, and fungal pathogenicity.
Opportunity
An interdisciplinary project is continuing to examine
the population genetics and functional genomics of the
beetle-fungus-tree interaction, in order to characterize
the uncertainty surrounding key population processes
aﬀecting outbreak wave propagation eastward. We are
seeking a qualiﬁed applied mathematician or quanti-
tative biologist to work with its team of scientists to
develop a mathematical and statistical model of moun-
tain pine beetle invasion biology that will use genomics-
based data to inform the spread model. These include
population genomic (large, spatially co-referenced mi-
crosatellite and SNP datasets for the beetle, fungus,
and tree) and functional genomic data (gene expression
analyses, physiological and biochemical characteriza-
tion of experimental samples) that relate to the beetle-
fungus-host symbiotic interactions. Relationships with
various geographic and climatic factors will also be ex-
plored.
The incumbent will have a PhD in mathematical sci-
ences and/or biological sciences with demonstrated ex-
perience in the development of analytical mathematical
models of epidemiological processes, and a familiarity
with simulation modeling approaches. A strong inter-
est in the use of population genetics and functional ge-
nomics data is essential. Familiarity and interest in
the problems of error propagation, uncertainty analy-
sis, stochasticity, and non-stationarity in complex (i.e.
nonlinear, multi-causal) systems is desirable.
The incumbent will be expected to work within a team

(BiGCB) at the University of California, Berkeley, is
seeking applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar for the
W.M. Keck Foundation Funded Project entitled* In-
formatics Engine for Understanding Biotic Response to
Global Change.*
The next generation of predictive models of the biotic
response to environmental change must meet the chal-
lenge of incorporating the eﬀects of complex interac-
tions among organisms, climate, and their physical and
biotic environments. A great variety of data types are
required to meet this challenge, including current and
past species’ distributions, data on their genotypes and
phenotypes and how these have changed in space and
time, as well as empirical and modeled data on environ-
mental and climate change. The goal of the project is
to develop the informatics infrastructure needed to ac-
cess, visualize, and analyze these rich data, thus provid-
ing the foundation for building the next generation of
models of the biotic response to global change. Initially,
the data to be integrated will be largely drawn from
Berkeley’s Natural History Museums, Field Stations,
and faculty labs. Please see * http://ib.berkeley.edu/-
labs/globalchange/funding.html* for more information.
The successful candidate, who will be an integral part of
the project, will help drive the intellectual exploration
of the kinds of questions one might ask of these data,
and help identify the data needed to conduct global
change research. S/he will conduct cutting-edge, mul-
tidisciplinary research that will demonstrate the scien-
tiﬁc power of this engine.
*Qualiﬁcations*:
- PhD and up to 3 years of postdoctoral research expe-
rience in a relevant discipline, such as: ecology, evolu-
tionary biology, or computer science. - Demonstrated
record of writing and/or publishing of manuscripts and
reports. - Demonstrated experience collaborating with
other researchers. - Experience and knowledge of biodi-
versity, ecology, conservation and/or bioinformatics and
a keen interest in natural history data and collections.
*Salary: * Salary commensurate with experience.
*To apply:* Applicants should send a cover letter, CV,
and contact information for three references to Sandra

UFlorida AvianPhylogenetics
Post-doctoral position in the phylogenetics of the avian
order Galliformes.
A post-doc position is available at the University of
Florida (Gainesville, Florida) to work with Rebecca
Kimball ( http://people.biology.uﬂ.edu/rkimball ) and
Edward Braun ( http://people.biology.uﬂ.edu/ebraun )
on the phylogeny and evolution of the Galliformes. The
order Galliformes includes the two most economically
important birds (the chicken and turkey; both with
complete genomes), some of the most spectacular and
recognizable birds (such as peafowl and pheasants), and
some of the most important avian model systems (e.g.,
the chicken and Japanese quail). Despite intensive re-
search on galliforms in many areas, their evolutionary
relationships remain poorly resolved, limiting the abil-
ity to put the extensive information about galliform
species into a comparative framework.This project will use multiple genes to produce a well-
resolved evolutionary tree for the avian order Galli-
formes by collecting sequences for many loci for a sub-
set of taxa, and a smaller set of loci for a large number
of taxa. One problem is this group arises from sev-
eral rapid radiations at diﬀerent evolutionary depths,
and the collection of data from large numbers of loci
will allow us to explore factors aﬀecting resolution of
these diﬃcult phylogenetic problems. The data ma-
trix will also allow examination of patterns of avian
molecular evolution, complementing existing informa-
tion available from mammals, while the resulting phy-
logeny should beneﬁt comparative studies.
Candidates should have completed a PhD (or will very
soon) and have a knowledge of phylogenetics. Ideal can-
didates will also have a background in computational
phylogenetics, experience in managing large datasets,
and/or strong molecular biology skills. Knowledge of
birds (particularly galliforms) is not required. The po-
sition is for one year but is renewable.
Questions and applications should be addressed to Re-
becca Kimball (rkimball@uﬂ.edu). Applications should
include: 1) a cover letter outlining your research experi-
ences, interests and career goals; 2) a c.v. including the
names and contact information for at least 3 references;
and 3) copies of up to 3 publications or manuscripts in
review. Review of applications will begin on May 21,
2012 and continue until position is ﬁlled.

project “Speciation in action”.
Project description Scandinavian populations of white-
ﬁsh form distinct ecomorphs with separate spawning
sites within 50-100 years. This ﬁnding provides a
unique opportunity to study sympatric speciation “as
it happens”. In this project we study the degree of
diﬀerentiation in genetic and morphological traits by
comparing diverging whiteﬁsh populations of diﬀerent
age (50-10 000 years). The objective is to produce a
time line showing in which order diﬀerent phenotypic
and molecular traits change, and, ultimately, to pro-
vide a mechanistic understanding of the ecological and
genetic mechanisms that leads to ecological speciation.
We are now looking for a candidate with strong compe-
tence in molecular population genetics and genomics.
Requirements To qualify for the position you should
have a PhD degree in evolutionary biology or equiva-
lent. Knowledge of population genetics, molecular ge-
netic methods (e.g. RNAseq, qRT-PCR, and genotyp-
ing) and bioinformatics/statistics is highly desirable.
From the successful candidate, we expect a documentedcapability of autonomous scientiﬁc research work and
skills in writing scientiﬁc publications in English. In-
ternational applicants are encouraged to apply.
Application The application should include a short de-
scription of your research interests and why you are in-
terested in the position, a CV, a publication list, copy
of PhD certiﬁcate and publications, and contact infor-
mation to 3 reference persons. The application should

UMontpellier HostPathogenCoevol
Postdoctoral Scientist in Host-Pathogen Coevolution
A two-year Postdoctoral Scientist position is available
on or after October 1st, 2012 at the University of Mont-
pellier II, France. The work will be performed in the
research group headed by Dr. Michael Hochberg, and
in association with Dr. Peter Thrall (CSIRO Canberra,
Australia) and Prof. Jennifer Dunne (Santa Fe Insti-
tute, USA). The project is fully funded by a grant from
the McDonnell Foundation.
Context: The proposed project will probe how envi-
ronments inﬂuence the structure of antagonistic coevo-
lutionary interactions. In nature individual organisms
are confronted with diverse arrays of abiotic and biotic
stresses and mortality factors. This generates higher
order complexity because of the multi-scale nature of
these interactions, and because both exogenous envi-
ronments and organisms shift and change in ways which
may be diﬃcult to predict. Our goal is to explain pat-
terns in the diversity of interactive traits between host
and pathogen, by manipulating this complexity at dif-
ferent scales and teasing apart the contributions of its
components to coevolutionary dynamics and popula-
tion structure. We are interested in both fundamental
approaches and their applications to the control of mi-
crobial pathogens and pests.
Requirements: PhD and demonstrated experience inmicrobial ecology and evolution. Candidates with ex-
perience in microbial molecular biology and having a
solid training in evolutionary biology are also encour-
aged to apply. Excellent command of scientiﬁc English.
Interested candidates should apply by 1 June 2012 by
sending (1) a letter of motivation, (2) a CV with pub-
lication list, and (3) the names, institutions and email
addresses of three references to Dr. Michael Hochberg

Postdoctoral position in Drosophila speciation and ge-
nomics
A 4-year NIH funded postdoctoral position is avail-
able in the laboratory of Dan Garrigan at the De-
partment of Biology at the University of Rochester.
The project focuses on speciation and evolutionary ge-
nomics of the three species of the Drosophila simulans
clade. The work includes reconstructing evolutionary
histories, both within and between species, from whole-
genome next-generation resequencing data. Analyses
will focus on models that include recombination, diver-
gence, gene ﬂow, and natural selection. Ultimately, the
project aims to integrate genomic maps of evolutionary
history with maps of hybrid male sterility factors.
Qualiﬁed candidates must have training in both bioin-
formatics and evolutionary genetics. The project is a
collaborative eﬀort with the laboratory of Dr. Daven
Presgraves. The Department of Biology at the Univer-
sity of Rochester oﬀers a rich intellectual environment,
with a strong focus on research in speciation and adap-
tation.
Applicants should email a brief cover letter, a pdf of
their current CV, and the names and contact infor-
mation for two references to Dan Garrigan at dgar-
riga@bio.rochester.edu. Review of applications will be-
gin immediately and continue until the position is ﬁlled.

androgen-mediated parental care behaviour
Proximate mechanisms mediating parental care be-
haviour have interested biologists for decades. In verte-
brates, androgen hormones such as testosterone appear
to mediate aspects of parental care, particularly those
behaviours involving defence of the young. High andro-
gen levels, however, also appear to inhibit nurturing be-
haviours, which can lead to a trade-oﬀ between protect-
ing young and caring for young. In the current study,
nesting male bluegill sunﬁsh (Lepomis macrochirus)
were implanted with 11-ketotestosterone, a promi-
nent androgen in ﬁsh, ﬂutamide, an androgen-receptor
blocker, or a placebo. Both aggressive behaviours dis-
played towards a brood predator and nurturing be-
haviours of the young were subsequently recorded, and
at the termination of the experiment, brains were ex-
tracted from the nesting males for mRNA analysis.
Androgen-implanted males displayed more aggression
and less nurturing, whereas ﬂutamide-implanted males
displayed the opposite pattern relative to the placebo
males. The current project will use the mRNA and
microarray and qRT-PCR approaches to examine vari-
ation in gene expression with the goal of identifying
candidate genes that are involved in mediating aggres-
sive and nurturing behaviours during parental care.
Qualiﬁcations: A PhD with a record of research excel-
lence as demonstrated by publications and conference

background in evolutionary and behavioural ecology.

Evolutionary Consequences of Physiological Adapta-
tion:May 1, 2012 EvolDir 79
Comparing the Allostasis and Reactive Scope Model in
African Striped Mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)
A two-year postdoc position in eco-physiology is avail-
able at the School of Animal, Plant and Environmental
Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand. Field
work will be done at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-
tion. The postdoc will be mentored by Dr. Neville Pil-
lay and Dr. Carsten Schradin (currently University of
Zurich and expected to be at the CNRS in Strasbourg,
France, from October 2012 onwards).
Project: Evolution of physiological adaptation: how
can animals survive and reproduce in an environment
characterized by variable droughts?
The concepts of allostasis and reactive scope have been
very successful in explaining physiological adaptation
and stress in free ranging birds, but have been ap-
plied to only a limited number of species. We want
to test predictions from both models for the ﬁrst time
in a mammalian species living in an extreme environ-
ment, the African striped mouse from the Succulent
Karoo semi-desert of South Africa. We will test the
predicted strong relationship between glucocorticoids
and energy expenditure (allostasis model) and aim to
measure homeostatic overload in free ranging animals,
especially gluconeogenesis via muscle catabolism, i.e.
muscle breakdown, a response to pathologically high
glucocorticoid levels, as would be indicated by high uric
acid blood levels (reactive scope model). We are espe-
cially interested in ﬁtness consequences of ecologically
mediated physiological adaptation.
Methods to be applied: The postdoc is expected to
spend the majority of the time in the ﬁeld. Methods
include trapping, marking, measuring and observing
striped mice. In the ﬁeld, food availability will be mea-
sured via plant surveys. Blood samples will be collected
for physiological measurements. An ABAXIS blood an-
alyzer is available at the research station and the post-
doc is expected to run this equipment. Blood glucose
and blood ketone levels can be measured directly in the
ﬁeld. Experiments using hormone implants (increase
of corticosterone levels during the dry season) will be
possible. Blood samples will be sent to Dr. Schradin’s
laboratory for hormone measurements.
A respirometry laboratory has been set up at the re-
search station. In collaboration with other projects
currently running at the research station, it is possi-
ble to measure resting metabolic rate (RMR). We also
plan to measure daily energy expenditure (DEE) using
doubly labeled water in collaboration with Dr. S. Blanc
from the CNRS in Strasbourg, France.
What we oﬀer: Access to a unique long-term ﬁeld studyand a well-equipped ﬁeld station. South Africa is coun-
try with many highlights, especially for ecologists and
evolutionary biologists. The University of the Witwa-
tersrand is in the centre of South Africa and oﬀers good
scientiﬁc infrastructure. It is internationally ranking
similar to many European universities. The project of-
fers opportunities for international collaborations.
The project is funded for two years by the South African
National Research Foundation (NRF). This includes re-
search expenses (e.g. ABAXIS analyzer) and costs of
travel for the project.
The stipend from the NRF is 80 000 Rand / year and
we anticipate to increase this to Rand135 000 / year via
funding from the University of the Witwatersrand. This
grant is suﬃcient for the living costs in South Africa
(approx. 6000 Rand / month, including accommoda-
tion).
Requirements of the candidate: The postdoc we are
looking for must be independent, creative and highly
motivated. Applicants should have solid knowledge in
at least two of these research areas: eco-physiology, be-
havioral endocrinology, evolutionary biology, ecology,
physiology, animal behavior. Good statistical skills are
a pre-requisite. Experience in ﬁeld work and working
with small mammals are of advantage. We expect the
applicant to have good writing skills and a good publi-
cation record, since a minimum of two publications per
year are expected from the successful candidate.
Application procedure and deadline: The position is
available from June 2012 onwards. There is no deadline
and applications will be reviewed in the order of appli-
cations. Applicants should make themselves available
for skype interviews at the end of May. The applica-
tion should be emailed to neville.pillay@wits.ac.za and
cc to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch as a single pdf con-
taining CV, list of publications, a statement of research
interests, and the names of two to three references with
contact details.

We are searching for two postdocs to work on the anal-
ysis of next generation sequencing data. One position
is available for the analysis of RNA-Seq data and an-
other position for re-sequencing of genomic DNA. Both
positions are associated with an ERC funded project
using experimental evolution to understand the evolu-
tionary dynamics of populations adapting to a novel
environment. We are using Drosophila as a model sys-
tem, since it is a sexual species with a short generation
time that can be maintained at large population sizes
in the laboratory. Both positions will be provided with
access to proprietary data and the opportunity to fur-
ther develop the project based on initial data analyses.
We are searching for applicants with a solid knowledge
in at least two of these research areas: statistics, popu-lation genetics and bioinformatics. Previous experience
with NGS data analysis is a bonus.
The position will be based at the Institute of Popula-
tion Genetics at the Vetmeduni Vienna (Austria). ).
The research focus of the Institute is on understand-
ing the genetics of adaptation. This central question in
evolutionary biology is being tackled using up-to-date
methods and a variety of approaches, including experi-
mental evolution, quantitative genetics, examination of
life history traits, Evo-Devo, empirical population ge-
netics, bioinformatics and statistics.
In recent years, Vienna has developed into one of
the leading centers in evolutionary biology ( http://-
www.evolvienna.at ). In addition to a stimulating scien-
tiﬁc environment, Vienna also oﬀers an extraordinarily
high quality of life. Aﬀordable housing, excellent pub-
lic transport, great restaurants, a range of international
schools, two operas, two music centers, many theaters
and museums in combination with a pleasant climate
make Vienna one of the most attractive cities in Eu-
rope.
The positions are available from July 2012.
The minimum salary will be 47334euro /year.
The application should be emailed to chris-
tian.schloetterer@vetmeduni.ac.at as a single pdf
containing CV, list of publications, a statement of
research interests, and the names of three references
with contact details. While the search will continue
until the position is ﬁlled, applications should be
received by April 30, 2012 to ensure full consideration.

en.sylt.de/ Workshop content: Our climate is changing
at an unprecedented rate, and there is ample evidence
that these changes have ecological consequences. The
key question now being asked is whether species will be
able to adapt fast enough to keep pace with changing
environments. Some species will be evolutionary
winners (e.g. invasive species), whereas others may
not fare as well (e.g. ephemeral populations). This
especially applies to marine ecosystems, where climate
change has multi-facetted consequences (e.g. ocean
warming and acidiﬁcation, high rates of biological
invasions and emerging diseases). Despite the growing
awareness of this, very few studies to date have
quantiﬁed the evolutionary potential of marine popu-
lations or the underlying mechanisms of adaptation.
Moreover, with the increasing importance of epigenetic
inheritance, the balance between genetic adaptation
(selection on standing genetic variation) and epigenetic
eﬀects (e.g. transgenerational phenotypic plasticity) in
response to fast-changing selective agents in the marine
environment needs to be reset. In this workshop we
will bring together researchers with a primary focus
on the evolutionary potential of marine populations
to adapt to rapidly changing environments. The
workshop will be arranged into three broad topics that
include:
1. Molecular and quantitative genetic approaches (e.g.
neutral and adaptive genetic variation, standing genetic
variation, candidate genes) to investigate adaptation inmarine populations
2. Abiotic and biotic selective agents (e.g. climate vari-
ability, parasites) that lead to changes in genetic varia-
tion in marine populations
3. Epigenetic inheritance (e.g. transgenerational plas-
ticity) as a mechanism to cope with rapid environmen-
tal change
Talks and posters will be presented in a relatively in-
formal setting with the aim of promoting discussions,
developing new ideas, and providing opportunities for
collaborations and networking.

be appropriate for those with a background in biology
and/or medicine at diverse levels. Special expertise in
evolutionary biology is not required, however those who
have already studied evolutionary biology will have spe-
cialized opportunities. In order to maximize beneﬁts
to this developing ﬁeld, admission preference will be
oﬀered to physicians and professors who teach or an-
ticipate teaching courses on the subject, and to mem-
bers of minority groups who may be eligible for support
from the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center. Re-
searchers and students from advanced undergraduate
to postdocs will be warmly welcomed. For more infor-
mation on evolution and medicine, see The Evolution

*Description*
This intensive one-week course will introduce strategiesfor applying core principles of evolutionary biology to
problems in medicine and public health, with a special
focus on infection and cancer. The course will not at-
tempt to cover all possible applications, it will focus
on a few examples. Some especially relevant principles
include life history theory, host pathogen co-evolution,
the regulation of defenses, developmental plasticity, and
trade-oﬀs shaping reproductive strategies. These prin-
ciples will be applied to clinically relevant topics includ-
ing aging, antibiotic resistance, clinical management
of fever, endothelial disease, prenatal experience and
metabolic syndrome, and reproductive cancers. This
year’s course will have extensive special expertise avail-
able on topics related to cancer and infectious disease.
Mornings will be devoted to lectures and structured dis-
cussions. After lunch, participants will gather in small
groups for faculty led discussions on a number of spe-
cialized topics such as strategies to prevent antibiotic
resistance, the role of infection in mental disorders, how
social evolution theory might advance new chemother-
apy strategies, how viral sequences get incorporated
into genomes, the role of imprinting in controlling gene
expression. Participants will be in small workgroups
with faculty and others who share specialized interests.
Most workgroups will investigate a speciﬁc topic, for
instance, malignant melanoma, cervical cancer, breast
cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, antibiotic resis-
tance, or vaccine design. Other groups will address
other topics such as strategies for educating physicians,
creating curriculum materials, or current debates about
levels of selection. Each group will develop a possi-
ble research or teaching project, for presentation on
Friday. Individuals are also free to create their own
projects. Late afternoons are not prescheduled, so par-
ticipants can organize their own additional discussions
and projects or pursue individual interests, including
recreation in Acadia National Park. Several optional
preplanned expeditions are available, including whale
watching, and guided hikes in the park. More informa-

Website: http://cobig2.fc.ul.pt/python101 Abstract:
In the current scientiﬁc environment, acquiring a solid
skill set in bioinformatics is something that any re-
searcher in biological sciences is likely to need at some
point. With the advent of Next-Generation sequencing
and the evolution of high-throughput technologies, this
need will continue to grow as the processing and analy-
sis of large amounts of data requires automated tools to
make sense of the results. Python is an opensource, in-
teractive and powerful programming language that will
answer to most of these needs by empowering users with
the ability to develop tools that are tailored for their
needs, from simple and quick scripts to large pipelines
and applications. These features coupled with python’s
smooth learning curve make it one of the most popular
programming languages in the ﬁeld of bioinformatics.
Whatever you require, python will provide a solution
that signiﬁcantly reduces workload and may enable the
accomplishment of previously unreachable objectives or
deadlines. This course aims to provide an introduction
to the basics of python programming and lay a solid
foundation for further and independent learning.
Attendees can expect an intensive hands-on training
experience that will allow:
* The identiﬁcation of some of the best ways in which
python programming can improve their research/work;
* A basic understanding of how pre-existent python
scripts work their “magic”;
* The development of their own simple scripts.
It is widely known that learning Python can dramati-
cally reduce the workload of biological researchers while
improving their results. Come and ﬁnd out why and
how!

http://academy.nescent.org/wiki/Moscow 2012 Com-
putational Phyloinformatics is a 12-day international
course (August 6-17, 2012) co-organized by Moscow
State University, the National Evolutionary Synthesis
Center (NESCent), the Institute for Information Trans-
mission Problems (Russian Academy of Sciences), and
the Phyloinformatics Research Foundation, Inc. This
course, which will take place at Moscow State Univer-
sity directly following the 3rd Moscow International
Conference on Molecular Phylogenetics (“MolPhy-3”
July 31 - August 4, 2012, www.en.molphy.ru ), aims
to give participants practical knowledge and hands-on
skills in phyloinformatics.
SYNOPSIS Biologists are faced with ever-larger
datasets, more complex evolutionary models, and in-
creasingly elaborate analytical methods. Seldom is it
suﬃcient to run a dataset with an oﬀ-the-shelf pro-
gram on a desktop PC; increasingly, biologists need
to write scripts to interface with internet services and
databases, build analytical pipelines, customize analy-
ses, and distribute computation over multiple proces-
sors. This course is designed for graduate students,
postdocs, faculty, and researchers in phylogenetics in-
terested in receiving practical, hands-on training in the
use of Perl and SQL for workﬂows and applications in
phyloinformatics.
The course is divided into six parts:
- Part I: A tutorial review of the UNIX shell envi-
ronment - Part II: A tutorial review of Perl, includ-
ing object oriented programming and building pack-
ages - Part III: Introduction and practical use of BioP-
erl and Bio::Phylo, (e.g. scripting for large tree infer-
ence engines, automating model testing, genomic-scale
data mining and acquisition, supertree assembly, rate
smoothing and branch calibration, tree traversal, etc).
- Part IV: Introduction and practical use of BioRuby
for molecular evolution and functional genomics (e.g.scripting multiple sequence alignment, gene duplication
inference, tree inference, etc.) - Part V: Introduction
to SQL and database design; computing and querying
both large trees (e.g. NCBI) and large collections of
trees (e.g. TreeBASE). - Part VI: A Mini Hackathon
where participants, working in small teams, use the
knowledge that they have acquired to solve elements
of a common challenge
Participants will learn how to write basic phylogenetic
or comparative analysis scripts, parse NEXUS ﬁles, tra-
verse and compute over trees, and make practical use
of phylogenetic software libraries. These skills will be
learned in a biological context, touching on a diverse
array of topics such as analysis of large datasets, au-
tomation of supertree assembly, querying for topolog-
ical patterns in large collections of trees, etc. Partici-
pants will leave the course with a full set of installations
and libraries on their computer ready to build phyloin-
formatic workﬂows for their own research projects, as
well as continued access to a 200+ page wiki “textbook”
containing step-by-step instructions, problem sets, and
examples.

PhenotypeOntologies Jul30-Aug3
Summer Course (1 week) on phenotype ontologies in
evolutionary biology and genetics at the National Evo-
lutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), Durham, NC
USA (July 30-Aug 3, 2012)
Primary instructors: Melissa Haendel, Matt Yoder

Evolutionary research has been revolutionized by the
explosion ofgenetic information available, and anatomy
ontologies must play a central crucial in relating this
knowledge to diversity. Anatomy ontologies and vo-
cabularies are widely used to index data and are crit-
ical for relating gene expression and phenotype data
across taxa. Within a single species, anatomy ontolo-
gies provide scaﬀolding that interconnects many kinds
of observations; across species, they provide evolution-
ary, developmental, and mechanistic insights. In or-
der for anatomy ontologies to successfully serve all of
these purposes, they must be constructed consistently
so that they can be utilized and understood by both
researcher and software alike. This course aims to
teach proper ontology design principles and practices
such that anatomical interoperability across evolution-
arily disparate taxa is achieved. It further seeks to
promote community growth and adoption of ontology-
based methods and tools. The subsequent beneﬁt is in
the form of shared access to the unique data store of
each community (e.g. genetic, genomic, developmental,
and evolutionary data).
The course covers a basic introduction to ontology de-sign principles and usage, speciﬁc ontology considera-
tions for anatomy, application of anatomy ontologies in
the context of evolutionary phenotype comparison, and
use of anatomy ontologies for image annotation in dif-
ferent taxa. There will be strong emphasis on hands-on
exercises that will develop ontology skills and provide
exposure to diﬀerent software applications that are use-
ful in variety of areas of evolutionary biology.

Why: The ’negrito’ hypothesis was one of the ﬁrst evo-
lutionary paradigms to emerge from the nascent aca-
demic discipline of Anthropology in the late 19th Cen-
tury. It posits that various indigenous groups through-
out island and mainland Southeast Asia have a shared
phenotype - deﬁned by short but gracile stature, dark
complexion, and tightly curled hair - due to common de-
scent from a putative ancestral population, representing90 EvolDir May 1, 2012
a pre-agricultural substrate of humanity in the region.
The International Workshop to be held in Paris 3-5th
September 2012 is designed to revisit the ’negrito’ hy-
pothesis within an inter-disciplinary framework involv-
ing contributions from Archaeology, Biological Anthro-
pology, Cultural Anthropology, Physical Anthropology,
Social Anthropology, Linguistics, and Population Ge-
netics. Methodological approaches will be both syn-
chronic and diachronic, and a comparative approach
is actively encouraged. The workshop will present the
latest research available and explore where there is a
common framework between the diﬀerent disciplines.
The workshop will be open for attendance by other in-
terested scholars working in the ﬁelds of Anthropology

Course description:
Within the growing ﬁeld of Systems Biology, the math-
ematical modelling of metabolic networks plays a very
important role. This has manifold medical and biotech-
nological applications, including the analysis and pre-
diction of the eﬀect of enzyme deﬁciencies, the detec-
tion of disease markers, the improvement of biosynthe-
ses and bioproduction processes etc. In this course,

late 90’s with the ﬁrst genomes being sequenced. At
the time, sequencing was costly and only major lab-
organisms and humans were sequenced. The other

quencing (NGS) technologies, costs have greatly de-
creased and the genomic revolution now extends to
these “non-model” organisms. A burst of full genome

Course description: The genomic revolution started in

organisms and humans were sequenced. The other
“non-model” organisms studied in evolution and ecol-
ogy were left behind. With the Next Generation Se-

challenging. This course addresses NGS data produc-
tion, processing and analysis. The objective is to see
how these data can be bioinformatically tracked and
how to plan NGS sequencing to ease up processing, as-
sembly and analysis.
NGS data requires special handling, diﬀerent fom
Sanger type sequencing data. NGS data consists of
a large number of reads, all of them short and with
even shorter overhang. Computationally, the assembly
of many short reads with small overhang and varying
quality is much more challenging. In practical terms,
researchers need to deal with NGS data in a diﬀerent
way, many times requiring unique computational skills.
Participants in this course can expect to gain practi-
cal insights on how to use NGS data in their projects
by a series of techniques that they will learn how to
combine. These techniques help the user to address a
variety of problems that are very common in research
projects. Participants will start by learning how to to
go from raw data to a usable dataset. And will end-up
knowing how to look at genome assemblies and map-May 1, 2012 EvolDir 93

They will also learn how to do NGS based comparative
and population genomics analysis.

Course description
Python is an object-oriented programming language
that is ideal for biological data analysis. The course
will start with very basic language concepts and in-
structions and will cover all the main language aspects,
including variables, types, modules, functions, excep-
tions, control of ﬂux, input, output, and classes. All
the examples and practical sessions will focus on solv-
ing particular biological problems. In particular, exam-
ples and practical sessions will cover: - working with
DNA and protein sequences - data retrieval from ﬁles
and their manipulation - running applications, such as
BLAST, locally and from a script - ﬁnding motifs in
sequences - parsing Swiss-Prot ﬁles, PDB ﬁles, EN-
SEMBL records, blast output ﬁles, etc. Biopython will
be also introduced and applied to some of the men-tioned examples. The course is meant to be highly in-
teractive and the students will continuously put theory
into practice while learning. By the end of the course,
the students will have a good understanding of Python
basics and will have acquired the skills to manage any
type of bioinformatics record and to run applications
from scripts. Unix/linux basic skills will be provided at
the beginning of the course. Target Audience
End-users of bioinformatics databases and tools that
aim at developing hands-on capabilities for biologi-
cal data analysis, ie writing their own or adapting
somebody else’s Python scripts in an autonomous way.
Course Pre-requisites
Basic familiarity with bioinformatics data resources
such as Uniprot/Swiss-Prot, Blast, ENSEMBL, PDB,
etc. The course is directed to biologists with little or
no programming experience and aims at making them
capable to use Python to autonomously manage and
analyse biological data.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
