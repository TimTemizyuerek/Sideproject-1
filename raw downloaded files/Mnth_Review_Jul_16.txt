The 3nd Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Symposium
Turkey 2016 (August 31 - September 3, Ankara) is
now accepting abstract submissions at http://bit.ly/-
eebst abstract Please nd more information at http://-
bit.ly/eebst2016 We invite talks and poster presenta-
tions in all areas of evolutionary biology and ecology. All
presentations will be in English and we heartily welcome
international participation.
This year's keynote speakers will be Judith Mank (Uni-
versity College London, UK), A. Townsend Peterson
(The University of Kansas), John L. Quinn (University
College Cork), and Nadia D. Singh (NC State Univer-
sity).
Abstract submission deadline for the Symposium has
been extended to 10 June 2016! Early registration closes
by June 30.
The organizers of the symposium have arranged with
Evolutionary Ecology Research for EER to seriouslyconsider the publication of groups of papers from the

Dear All,
We are very happy to announce the upcoming Zoology
2016 congress and its CRC-satellite symposium, taking
place from 15 to 17 December 2016 at Antwerp Univer-
sity and the Antwerp ZOO. This year's edition will be
the 23th zoology congress annually organised on behalf
of the Royal Belgian and Dutch Zoological Societies.
At the Zoology Congress, zoologists studying life in allJuly 1, 2016 EvolDir 3
its aspects (from molecules to ecosystems) will meet
and discuss. Young scientists are particularly invited
to participate, but all zoologists, at any stage of their
careers, are very welcome to submit.
The theme for the keynote presentations is Nature con-
servation in a changing world. Our planet is in the
midst of a wave of man-made extinction. Reversing
this dreadful trend will require input from| various
elds in biology and beyond. In an attempt to stimulate
a multidisciplinary approach to conservation biology,
Zoology 2016 has invited four keynote speakers who
are studying zoological biodiversity issues from dierent
angles. However, the organizers await submissions from
all elds in animal sciences.
Linked to the keynote theme, the Antwerp ZOO Cen-
tre for Research and Conservation (CRC) will present
the results of its research projects in zoo-science and
conservation to a general public during the satellite
symposium.
Please, visit the website at www.zoology2016.be for
more detailed information, registration and abstract
submission.|
We look forward to meeting you at Zoology 2016.

Dear all,
We have the pleasure to announce a CNRS-Jacques
Monod Conference entitled \Evolutionary genomics and
systems biology: bringing together theoretical and ex-
perimental approaches" that will take place in Rosco
(France) from 10 to 14 October 2016.
Deadline for abstract submission (mandatory for par-
ticipation to a Jacques Monod Conference): 22 June2016 (see instructions on CNRS website http://-
www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/2016/Vekemans e.html) The or-
ganizers: Xavier Vekemans (UMR Evo-Eco-Pal eo, Lille;
xavier.vekemans@univ-lille1.fr) and Christian Landry
(Institut Biologie Int egrative et des Syst emes, Laval
University, Qu ebec; christian.landry@bio.ulaval.ca)
Presentation of the conference: Genomic tools are be-
coming essential in biological investigations that relate
to agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and biodiversity
science. Moreover, evolutionary concepts and an evolu-
tionary genomics perspective are becoming central to
interpret any new nding in these elds and develop for-
ward approaches for problem solving. The potential of
evolutionary genomics is unparalleled as it provides key
insights into our understanding of many fundamental
and applied questions such as the evolutionary history
of life on earth and the molecular bases of adaptation
of species in response to environmental changes in nat-
ural populations and crop improvement. However, the
maturation of evolutionary thinking in these elds in-
volving genomic approaches is an ongoing process and
needs to be supported by initiatives that will update
key analytical, conceptual and experimental innovations
in evolutionary genomics.
The objective of the proposed conference is to make
such synthesis possible by bringing leaders in the eld
together to discuss their ongoing research and vision of
where the eld is moving over the coming years. Accord-
ingly, we aim at fostering the link between functional
and evolutionary perspectives towards an integrative
approach of evolutionary genomics, and propose a con-
ference with: two sessions on evolutionary systems biol-
ogy and experimental evolution; one session on genome
evolution; two sessions on theoretical and empirical
population genomics. Because evolutionary genomics
largely focuses on processes (how mutations arise and
x in populations) and systems biology on functions
(how mutations are translated into phenotypes), we are
convinced that this combination will allow to progress
towards a better understanding of evolutionary pro-
cesses and its applications. Besides this focus on an
integrative approach, a second aim of the conference
is to bring together evolutionary genomic researchers
working on a large panel of organisms, from bacteria
to humans, including e.g. plants and fungi, in order
to foster the cross-exchange of evolutionary concepts,
analytical methods and experimental approaches.

Aug26-27
Dear Colleagues,
The eld of population genetics has a remarkable tra-
dition of being a tight-knit and nurturing community.
In order to better foster that sense of community for
popgen groups in the Midwest, *we are organizing the
third edition of the Midwest PopGen conference*.
The location this year will be the University of Chicago.
The date this year will be: August 26th-27th. The meet-
ing will begin Friday at noon and continue to Saturday
evening with a BBQ on Friday evening.
Approximately fteen 25-minute talks will be selected
from submitted abstracts, and there will be a poster
session. The meeting will again be trainee-oriented,
so students and postdocs are especially encouraged to
present their work. There will be a small prize for best
poster and best talk by a student and postdoctoral
fellow.
If you do plan to attend, please RSVP by adding your
name and information to the registration list (http://-
bit.ly/1Yb3Pkl) and if you would like to given an oral
presentation submit your abstracts by July 25th to Can-
dice Lewis <cllewis at uchicago dot edu >. Submitters
will be notied if their abstract is chosen for a talk by
August 1st. A tentative schedule and accommodation
advice are also provided as tabs on the registration
Google Sheet (http://bit.ly/1Yb3Pkl).
We hope you can make it and that we can continue this
meeting for the population geneticists in our region!

The origin of odorant receptors in insects
A PhD position is available to study the origins of a
unique family of receptors for odorants and pheromones
that arose early in the evolution of insects. Supported
from a grant from the prestigious Marsden Fund, the
PhD project will address the timing and role of the rst
insect odorant receptors. Our hypothesis is that they
appeared just before the origin of insect ight and ex-
panded to ll roles in detecting food, predators and/or
mates in this new three dimensional environment. The
research will involve the isolation of candidate odorant
receptors from the transcriptomes and genomes of early
insects and their deorphaning in surrogate cell systems.

BothPhD students will participate in a collaborative
research project with PD Dr Piet Spaak (Eawag) and10 EvolDir July 1, 2016
Prof. Justyna Wolinska (IGB), nanced by the Swiss
and German Science Foundations (SNF & DFG).
Eutrophicationis a worldwide environmental problem
accelerated by global warming, aecting the stability of
aquatic ecosystems and having long^ aconsequences. We
will investigate if and how eutrophication aects two
interacting evolutionary processes: disease spread and in-
terspecic hybridization. We will use water eas (Daph-
nia), a well-established model in both host-parasite and
hybridization research. This project is a combination
of eld surveys of two eutrophic lakes, a large scale
mesocosm experiment (where trophic conditions will be
manipulated), the transcriptional proling of Daphnia
exposed to stressful eutrophic conditions, and the devel-
opment and application of molecular markers to study
parasite evolution in eutrophic environments. Over-
all, through the unique combination of expertise and
methods, this project will improve our understanding
of disease spread and biodiversity loss under dierent
trophic conditions and, consequently, might provide
tools for management of aquatic ecosystems.
Theposition at IGB focuses on host-parasite interactions.
The main task will be development of molecular markers
(SNPs) for a model parasite species and application of
these markers to study parasite evolution. Thus, the
student will participate in preparation of samples for
de novo sequencing of the whole parasite genome. De-
veloped markers will be applied on eld-collected and
experimental samples (i.e. amplicon sequencing on Illu-
mina). The bioinformatics component will be performed
in collaboration with a postdoctoral researcher, but the
student is expected to learn and help with that part.
In addition, some microscopy work, eld work and/or
experimental work might be accommodated, depending
on skills and interests.
Theposition at Eawag focuses on interspecic hybridiza-
tion. Here, the main task will be participation in a
large-scale eld study and mesocosm experiment, data
collection and processing. The student will screen the
dynamics of hybridizing Daphnia communities, using al-
ready established microsatellite and SNP markers. Also,
the student will conduct a large laboratory experiment
to assess Daphnia stress responses; here, RNA-Seq meth-
ods will be applied. The PhD student will take advan-
tage of the draft D. galeata genome. A postdoctoral
researcher will help with analyses of RNA-Seq data.
Althoughthe students will be hosted primarily at their
given institution, exchange stays are planned at Eawag
and IGB, respectively. Moreover, generous funds are
available to cover attendance at national and interna-
tional conferences. The students will take part in the
organized PhD programs (including attending variousskills courses) of their respective institution: http:/-
/www.eawag.ch/en/teaching/academic-education/
http://www.igb-berlin.de/PhD Training.html Thepo-
sitions will be for a period of three years, and should
start as soon as possible (January 2017 or even earlier).
The Eawag PhD student will be enrolled at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z urich, the
German PhD student at Free University in Berlin.
Theideal candidate should have good molecular skills
and a strong background in evolutionary biology, ecol-
ogy or related elds. In addition, knowledge of statistics,
bioinformatics and/or population genetics will be highly
advantageous. Excellent communication and writing
skills in English, good work ethic, and creative thinking
are desired. A Masters Degree (or equivalent) in biology
or a related subject is necessary for admission. The
working language in the groups is English. In keeping
with the IGB's policy regarding gender equality, female
applicants are particularly encouraged. Severely dis-

ForestGeneticAdaptation
Dear all,
As part of the GenTree project, we are looking for highly
motivated PhD candidates, with a training in functional
or evolutionary ecology and modeling to work on innova-
tive strategies for conservation of forest genetic resources
under climate change. The project will mostly involve
predictive modeling, but some eld work will also be
required.
The doctoral research will be composed of four main
tasks. Tasks 1 and 2 aims to confront two types of pre-
dictions of forest genetic resources (FGR) vulnerability:
the one across the distribution range of species obtained
through bioclimatic niche model with that obtained
through a process-based ecophysiological model to shed
light on the ecological processes underlying vulnerabil-
ity. In tasks 3 and 4, an individual-based simulation
model integrating ecophysiological, demographic and
genetic processes will be used to predict the dynamics of
FGR conservation networks under climate change, and
to propose innovative management methods of these
networks. First, the model will be rened, to better ac-
count for regeneration. Then, the model will be used to
investigate the role of genetic diversity in the adaptiveJuly 1, 2016 EvolDir 13
response of trees populations to climate change, and
how management may contribute to this response.
The PhD student will be registered in the doctoral
school GAIA (Biodiversit e, Agriculture, Alimentation,
Environnement, Terre, Eau), of the University Mont-
pellier II (https://gaia.umontpellier.fr/). The PhD will
begin no later than November 2016.. Ability to interact
in English is required and non-French candidates are
welcome. Find out more (link to full PDF)

MasseyU PlantSelectiveSweeps
PhD student position, Massey University New Zealand
{ selective sweep mapping in forage plant species
A postgraduate studentship is available to pursue PhD
research on the identication of selective sweeps associ-
ated with articial or natural selection in forage plant
species. This project will be supported from the AgRe-
search MBIE-funded research programme \Genomics for
Production and Security in a Biological Economy". The
PhD candidate will be enrolled with Massey University,
Palmerston North with the Institute of FundamentalSciences.
The principal objective is to use genotyping-by-
sequencing (GBS) technology to locate genomic selec-
tive sweeps resulting from selection for important forage
traits. A complementary aspect will be application of a
novel transcriptomics approach to identifying candidate
genes associated with these traits. These tools will be
focused on (1) a nutritive trait selectively bred in white
clover; and (2) drought response in white clover and
perennial ryegrass populations. The overall goal is to
understand genomic responses to selection with a view
to extending this knowledge into the development of
molecular selection tools for breeding applications.
The rst component targets soluble energy levels in
white clover leaves. The research will utilise breeding
populations selected for dierential levels of leaf soluble
energy, using GBS data to identify selective sweep sig-
natures associated with this important nutritive trait.
A transcriptomics approach, highlighting genes with ev-
idence of plasticity for the trait of interest, will also be
used to identify gene loci as candidates for selection and
these will be evaluated further in analyses of GBS pro-
les. The second component will target selective sweeps
in white clover and ryegrass associated with plant persis-
tence under drought, utilising pasture populations from
environmentally contrasting sites in New Zealand. The
contrasting biology of these forage species will provide
insight into genetic responses to selective pressure.
The programme will include the participation of Asso-
ciate Professor Kenneth Olsen (Washington University,
USA) incorporating a stay of up to 4 months in the Olsen
laboratory, where relevant genetic analysis approaches
will be learned.
The successful candidate will have a strong BSc (Hons)
or MSc (Hons) degree in genetics, molecular biology or
a related discipline.
Expertise in bioinformatics or biostatistics would be
desirable.
English language prociency is essential. The stu-
dentship, funded by AgResearch, provides an annual
stipend of $30,000 plus payment of domestic tuition fees
and research expenses for three years.
For your application to be considered you must apply
online, please include the following (i) a cover letter
outlining your suitability and interest in the position,
(ii) a current curriculum vitae and names of three refer-
ees online via https://careers.sciencenewzealand.org/-

Dresden has an opening for a PhD position.
We are hiring for an evolutionary genomics project that
aims at discovering the dierences in the genome that
underlie phenotypic dierences between species. The
project will involve applying methods that we have
developed in the lab to build high-quality genome align-
ments, detect functional genomic dierences, and asso-
ciate these genomic to phenotypic dierences between
species. For promising candidate loci, we will experi-
mentally test whether editing these genomic loci with
Crispr/Cas9 in a model organism recapitulates the nat-
ural phenotypic dierences.

Queensland FruitFlyEvolution
PhD scholarships - Macquarie University and CSIRO
(Australia)
Closing Date: Expressions of interest close at midnight
on 30 June, 2016
Three PhD opportunities are available on projects inves-
tigating pre-'and post-'copulatory sexual performance
of Queensland fruit y (Bactrocera tryoni, aka Qy).
Each of these projects is part of a signicant collabo-
ration between Macquarie Universitys Department of
Biological Sciences and Australias Commonwealth Sci-
entic and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
Projects include:
(1) Polyandry and paternity patterns, (2) Mediation
of mating-'induced sexual inhibition, (3) Genetics and
genomics of reproductive tness.
(1) Polyandry and paternity patterns
Molecular techniques will be used to assess multiple
paternity and patterns of sperm use in natural and labo-
ratory populations, and to identify male traits (e.g., size,
age, rearing environment, experience, nutritional state)
associated with paternity advantages under controlled
environmental conditions. The host research groups
have been working on Q-'y mating behaviour, physiol-
ogy, and reproduction for many years, and have access
to a vast array of facilities and techniques in house and
through collaboration. Existing knowledge and access
to ample facilities provides an excellent platform for
a motivated and imaginative student to advance this
eld through the adoption of diverse approaches and
methods.
This project would be carried out under supervision of
Prof Phil Taylor and Prof Michael Gillings of Macquarie
University and Drs John Oakeshott, Ronald Lee and18 EvolDir July 1, 2016
Owain Edwards of CSIRO. The successful applicant
would be based principally at Macquarie University in
Sydney.
(2) Mediation of mating-induced sexual inhibition
Virgin female Qies show high levels of sexual recep-
tivity, but once mated they reject courtship attempts
of subsequent males. Previous research has highlighted
reproductive accessory gland uids produced by males
and passed with the ejaculate as key. This project will
use a combination of genetics/genomics, biochemistry,
and metabolomics approaches to identify the factors
mediating mating-'induced sexual inhibition of female
Qies, to understand their production, and to determine
their modes of action. Oakeshotts group at CSIRO has
considerable experience investigating the biochemistry
and genetics/genomics underpinning mating induced
sexual inhibition and related behavioural changes in
insects. This group has deep skills in metabolomics and
proteomics, and have the in-'house state-'of-'the-'art
facilities required for successful metabolomics and pro-
teomics. Taylors group at Macquarie has carried out
all of the research on mating induced sexual inhibition
in this species to date, and comprises a large research
community working on diverse aspects of Qy behaviour
and physiology.
This project would be carried out under the supervision
of Dr John Oakeshott of CSIRO (with additional sup-
port from Drs Matt Taylor, Gunjan Pandey and Peter
Campbell) and Prof Phil Taylor of Macquarie University.
The successful applicant would be based principally at
CSIRO in Canberra.
(3) Genetics and genomics of reproductive tness
The purpose of this research is to identify the genetic
basis of reproductive characteristics that drive mat-
ing performance of male Queensland fruit y (e.g.,
pheromone composition, calling behaviour, reproductive
eort, sperm transfer, ability to induce sexual inhibi-
tion in mates). The strategy for this research is to rst
identify the genes underlying these traits of interest, or
genetic markers linked to these genes, using quantita-
tive or association genetics methods. Once identied,
this information can be used to understand the popu-
lation genetic processes key to the implementation of
the Sterile Insect Technique now in development for the
control of Queensland fruit y. A PhD project would
be developed around traits that the project team has
identied as being important in driving mating success,
and would aim to quantify the level of variation in the
trait, identify the genetic basis for this variation, and
develop and test strategies to retain variation during
domestication for subsequent selection experiments.This project would be carried out under the supervision
of Drs Ronald Lee, John Oakeshott and Owain Edwards
of CSIRO and Prof Phil Taylor at Macquarie University.
The successful applicant would be based principally at
CSIRO in Canberra.

Spain 3 ForestAdaptiveEvolution
Within the frame of the Spanish MINECO grant 'FU-
TURPIN' (2016-2018, Adaptive framework for future
management of genetic resources in Mediterranean
pines), co-participated by three leading research institu-
tions in their respective elds of expertise, we are search-
ing for 3 prospective highly-motivated PhD candidates
with interest in forest genetics and ecophysiology, plant-
biotic interactions, evolutionary biology and climate
change eects on terrestrial vegetation. We oer 3 four-
year pre-doctoral grants associated to already ongoing
projects carried out under the umbrella of FUTURPIN.
Successful candidates will be based in one of the three
research institutions: CSIC-MBG (Pontevedra), UdL
(Lleida) and INIA-CIFOR (Madrid, coordinating insti-
tution).
The three projects aims together at bridging the gap
between (i) the existing lack of knowledge on the genetic
architecture of life history traits and how the environ-
ment explains the integration of phenotypic traits (ii) the
design of strategies for the management of forest genetic
resources pursuing the persistence of Mediterranean pine
populations and the maintenance of intraspecic genetic
diversity in the near future. The projects will study
intraspecic variation in life history traits across popula-
tions in several Iberian pine species, aiming to progress
in the understanding of dierent adaptive syndromes.
This is a preliminary call to contact interested candi-
dates and facilitate interaction prior to the launch of
the ocial call by the Spanish Science and Technology
Agency (formerly known as FPI grants). We expect
the call will be launched in summer 2016. The UdL
grant will be covered by the hosting institution with
conditions equivalent to a FPI grant.
Strong motivation, well founded analytical thinking and
good oral and written communication skills in English
are essential. Previous international experience is bene-
cial. Prospective candidates should send a short CV
and motivation letter (max. one page) outlining their
previous experience, why they are interested in this
particular topic and by which project they are most
attracted.If interested please send CV and letter to Jos e Climent
(climent@inia.es), Rafael Zas (rzas@mbg.csic.es) and
Jordi Voltas (jvoltas@pvcf.udl.es) as soon as possible,
preferably before 15th July.
Details of the FPI funding scheme can be found
in http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/-
?lang choosen=en
Details about each project are as follows:
INIA-CIFOR: Project 1 deals with the evolutionary
compromises between life-history traits and the real-
time genetic change between generations deriving from
dierential tness of the integrated phenotype. The
PhD student will be co-supervised by Dr. Jos e Climent
(INIA-CIFOR) and by Dra. Rosario Sierra (ETSIA,
Univ. Valladolid), in close collaboration with Dr. Ri-
cardo Al a (INIA-CIFOR).
MBG-CSIC: Project 2 focuses on resistance and toler-
ance to biotic stress (herbivory) and on the reproductive
temporal dynamics (masting) in Iberian pines, analysing
their intraspecic genetic variation and the phenotypic
and genetic relationships with the other life history
traits addressed by the other subprojects. The PhD
student will be supervised by Dr. Luis Sampedro and
Dr. Rafael Zas at the MBG-CSIC (Pontevedra, Spain).
UdL: The PhD student will analyse the variability of
intraspecic responses to the environment (driven by
water scarcity) for several Iberian pines. He/she will
collaborate to develop applications of emerging pheno-
typing technologies potentially useful in forest genetics.
The PhD student will be supervised by Dr. Jordi Voltas
in collaboration with Dr. Juan Pedro Ferrio (Universi-
dad de Concepci on, Chile).
Ample interaction among teams integrating FUTURPIN
will be essential for the success of all PhD projects, and
further collaborations with top scientists in forest ge-
netics, ecophysiology and evolution worldwide will be
strongly encouraged and facilitated.

PhD Studentship in plant breeding/genetics (Ireland)
Walsh Fellowship Reference 2016014
Using next generation sequencing to track changes in
the genomic composition of perennial ryegrass swards
over time
We seek a highly motivated graduate who wants to gain
a PhD in the area of genomics, working in collabora-
tion with scientists at Ireland's leading agricultural re-
search agency (Teagasc) and Ireland's leading university
(Trinity College Dublin; TCD). This position is funded
through the Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Scheme and will
attract an annual tax-free allowance of euro22,000 to
cover university fees and stipend.
What it's about: Perennial ryegrass is Ireland's most
important plant species. It is used as forage, and under-
pins the livestock and dairy sectors. Perennial ryegrass
swards are highly heterogeneous and can change over
time in response to environmental variation and man-
agement practice. In order to gain a better insight into
this phenomenon, we will monitor changes in the ge-
netic composition of PRG swards over time. We will
test whether these changes are random, or whether they
can be related to management practices causing some
plants to be preferentially selected over others. This
will lead to a greater understanding of ^ apersistence'.
Where it's based: This studentship is based in the For-
age Genomics Group in the Crop Science Department,
at the Teagasc campus in Oak Park, Carlow; a vibrant
market town about 50 mins south of Dublin. Oak Park
is the national centre for tillage and bioenergy crops re-
search, and the site incorporates a 239ha research farm
with state of the art laboratory facilities for molecular
biology (http://www.agresearch.teagasc.ie/oakpark/).This is an exciting opportunity to work in a profes-
sional multi-disciplinary environment where you will
gain experience in genomics, computational biology and
grasslands management from experienced scientists in
the Forage Genomics group (Susanne Barth, Dan Mil-
bourne) and Grasslands Science Department (Michael
O'Donovan and Deirdre Hennessy) in Teagasc, and the
Department of Botany at TCD (Trevor Hodkinson).
The ideal candidate: The studentship would suit some-
one with a primary (minimum BSc Hons, 2.1 or equiva-
lent) or Masters level degree in life sciences, statistical
genetics, and computational biology.
The PhD will involve lab-work, eld-work and, im-
portantly, it will have a strong computational biol-
ogy/bioinformatics component. A full driving licence
is a pre-requisite for the position, since it will require
frequent visits to eld trials located at Teagasc's Grass-
lands and Dairy Production Research Centre in Co.
Cork.
Applications are invited immediately, with a view to
starting in September 2016 or March 2017. The closing
date for applications is 31 July 2016. Please apply by
sending a CV and covering letter outlining your back-
ground and why you are interested in the post to either
Dr Dan Milbourne (dan.milbourne@teagasc.ie) or Prof.

Calgary) and Dr. Cameron Goater (Univ. Lethbridge)
based in Alberta, Canada.
The student will take a major role in sequencing and an-
notating the genomes of both infected ants and parasite
larvae collected at dierent phases of host manipulation.
The main aim is to utilize this model system to test the
chemical-mediation hypothesis for the manipulation of
host behaviour by parasites. The student will gain ex-
pertise in DNA sequencing, from the molecular biology
of DNA sequencing, through to the bioinformatics tools
that are used in modern genome analyses. The student
will also have an opportunity to contribute to ongoing
eld-studies involving infected and uninfected ants at
sites in southern Alberta.
The Wasmuth and Goater labs are members of the Host-
Parasite Interactions (HPI) training program, which is
a $1.6m investment by the Canadian Natural Sciences
and Environmental Research Council (NSERC). The
HPI program is made up eleven labs from three Cana-
dian universities (www.ucalgary.ca/hpi). In addition
to promoting close and integrative research links, the
program oers students a wide range of opportunities,22 EvolDir July 1, 2016
including career-oriented workshops, an annual training
bootcamp in the Rocky Mountains, science engagement
with the public, and travel scholarships.
The student should have completed a B.Sc. (or equiva-
lent) in the life sciences with a strong academic record
(e.g. GPA 3.6 in Canadian standards or 2i in UK). Ex-
perience in either a molecular biology or bioinformatics
lab is a considerable advantage.

PlantHybridFitness
Fora good candidate with a MSc degree in evolutionary
biology I have funding available for the rst 15 months
of a PhD position, starting in October 2016, to work in
my group on the subject of tness of natural hybrids be-
tween two Rhinanthus species (see Natalis & Wesselingh
Oecologia 2012, Am J Bot 2012, Evolution 2013).
Theaim of the project is to study tness in hybrids
of known and unknown descent and link their perfor-
mance to the composition of their genome. The work
will involve eld observations (plant size, pollinator
behaviour, seed production), greenhouse work (hand-
crossing plants) and genetic analyses using NGS tech-
niques. UCLouvain is located in Louvain-la-Neuve, a
small campus town in the French-speaking part of Bel-
gium, at only 30 km from Brussels, Namur and Leuven.
Itwill be necessary to apply for another type of grant
to get funding for the full 4-year PhD period, for which
the rst opportunity will present itself in September
2016 (and there will be two more opportunities after
that before the rst funding runs out). The net monthly

UGdansk OrchidEvolution
Two PhD positions are open in 2016 to 2019 at the Uni-
versity of Gdansk, within an international network fo-
cusing on evolution of orchid symbiosis and metabolism,
Orchidomics (funded by the Polish National Science
Centre; Maestro7-NZ to M.-A. Selosse; 2016 to 2020).
Fields of interest and research objective: Prof. M.-A.
Selosse's team is based in Brazil (Vi cosa), France (Na-
tional Museum of Natural History, MNHN-Paris) and
Poland (Gdansk) and studies the ecology and evolution
of mycorrhizal symbiosis, i.e. the association of plant
roots with soil fungi, in tropical and temperate regions.
The current project focuses on our special interest in
mycorrhizae of temperate orchids and their role in plant
physiology. In most cases, fungi provide soil minerals
to the plant, in exchange for photosynthetic sugar. Yet,
during orchid germination, the fungi provide carbon
to germinating seedlings that have no reserve. More-
over, in some orchid species, adult plants also recover
carbon from their fungi: some are achlorophyllous and
non-photosynthetic (mycoheterotrophic species) while
others are green and mix photosynthesis with exploita-
tion of fungal carbon (mixotrophic species). We aim to
study these various nutritional strategies (germination,
adult autotrophy, mycoheterotrophy and mixotrophy)
within several evolutionary and ecological frameworks,July 1, 2016 EvolDir 23
using metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches in
situ. These original approaches open the way to a new
integrated vision of plant biology and its evolution.
Research environment: The core team is at the Depart-
ment of Plant Taxonomy and Nature Conservation, Uni-
versity of Gdansk (UG, Poland). Here, the Orchidomics
team encompasses 5 full researchers, including one post-
doctoral researcher working on bioinformatics. The PhD
candidates, based at UG, will be part of the international
network of renowned European scientic institutions in-
volved in Orchidomics. This includes Adam Mickiewicz
University in Pozna n (Prof. I. Maka ^A3owska), the Fac-
ulty of Biotechnology of UG and the Medical University
of Gda nsk (Prof. E. ojkowska), MNHN in Paris (Prof.
M.-A. Selosse) and its Molecular Facilities (Dr. R. De-
bruyne), and the University of Fribourg (P.-E. Courty).
After developing their respective skills, the PhD can-
didates may contribute as co-authors to other projects
within this network and in Brazil. The PhDs include
scientic training (internship) at MNHN or other uni-
versities of the network, and a cotutelle (joint PhD
programme) will be considered upon request.
Position description: Orchidomics explores nutritional
traits of orchids along ecological gradients and evolu-
tionary diversication of terrestrial orchids, based on
eld sampling and using cutting-edge omics methods.
The positions open will involve the candidate in eld
sampling and eld data collection (as part of the team),
generating transcriptomic or metabolomic data (on their
respective samples), interacting with colleagues for bioin-
formatics analyses and paper writing.
PhD #1 will investigate how nutrition and physiology
respond to abiotic conditions in situ throughout the
orchid's lifespan. The candidate must have an interest
in and basic knowledge of plant ecology and ecophysi-
ology. The candidate will especially learn and develop
metabolomic analyses, but will receive training in all
omics.
PhD #2 will investigate the evolution of metabolism in
taxa where mycoheterotrophy emerged. The candidate
must have an interest in and basic knowledge of evolu-
tion and/or symbiotic interactions. The candidate will
especially learn and develop transcriptomic analyses,
but will receive training in all omics.
The PhD candidates will work together and with the
team on a basis allowing rst authorships for each of
them. Candidates must have earned a Master's Degree
in the life sciences. We value a background in molecular
biology and an interest in team working. We require a
good level of spoken and written English.
Duration: 3 years, from 01.10.2016 to 30.9.2019.Salary: Competitive scholarship on the basis of local
standards.
How to apply: Prepare a cover letter in English explain-
ing your interest. Indicate which PhD (ecological or evo-
lutionary focus, i.e. #1 or #2) you are applying for and
why. Give the names and email addresses of two people
with rst-hand knowledge of your skills and past research
experience. Add a curriculum-vitae (2 pages maximum).
Send your completed application in a single pdf le to
the principal investigator (ma.selosse@wanadoo.fr).
Call for applications open until the positions are lled.
For full consideration, apply by July 10th, 2016.

ULausanne EvolutionaryAdaptation
The Department of Ecology and Evolution, University
of Lausanne, is currently inviting applications for 1 PhD
position in Ecological and evolutionary responses to
climate change in the group of Prof. Jake Alexander,
starting 1 ^st September 2016 or soon thereafter. The
position is funded through the ERC project \Novel
interactions and species' responses to climate change"
(NICH) for 3 years (1 year contract renewable for 2
additional years, at 100 %).
A great ecological challenge is understanding and pre-
dicting the responses of species, communities and ecosys-
tems to global climate change. Progress will hinge on
our ability to predict how responses are shaped by evolu-
tion and species interactions, and especially by entirely
novel interactions among species whose ranges don't
yet overlap. Within this project, we aim to test the
ecological consequences of novel competitors for the
persistence of alpine plant populations, and the poten-
tial for longer-term evolutionary responses to changing
competitive environments. Furthermore, we will test
the ability of functional traits to predict the outcome
of novel competitive interactions, which will feed into
process-based models of climate change range dynamics.
The project will combine a range of experimental and
modelling approaches, including whole community trans-
plant experiments and competition experiments along
an elevation gradient in our eld sites in the western
Swiss Alps.
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student holding
a Masters degree or equivalent in ecology, evolutionary
biology or another relevant discipline, with a strong
interest and expertise in evolutionary and ecological
concepts, (experimental) eld ecology and statistics.
Excellent scientic writing skills in English, as well as a
driving license, are also required.
The Department of Ecology and Evolution oers a di-
verse and stimulating working environment, and Lau-sanne a city with a high quality of living and ready
access to cultural and recreational activities.

The evolution of molecular innovation: how proteins
gain and lose functions and interactions
Simon Lovell, David Robertson, Sarel Fleish-
man, Dan Tawk https://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=75491&LID=1020 Detailed
knowledge of the evolution of these interactions is im-
portant for understanding the evolution of function, if
we are to engineer interactions for biotechnological and
synthetic biology applications, and to understand how
pathogens, particularly viruses, manipulate the host. In
this project we propose a multidisciplinary approach
to understanding the evolution or protein-protein inter-
actions, combining tools from atomistic protein design,
phylogenetic analysis, and in vitro selection.
Of key importance is the evolution of binding speci-
city, since change in specicity can lead to \rewiring"
of interaction networks. The interfaces through which
proteins interact, however, are complex, typically con-
taining many amino-acid residues that collectively must
contribute to binding specicity as well as binding an-
ity, structural integrity of the interface and solubility in
the unbound state. The result is a complicated set of
constraints on the evolution of protein structure and on
the interactions made. Innovation therefore requires aset of evolutionary changes that maintain all of these
characteristics for the entire chain of intermediates.
Funding is available for one studentship (fees and
stipend), commencing September 2016. This stu-
dentship is supported by the University of Manchester
and the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel). The
successful student would be required to spend 2 years
in Manchester and 2 years in Israel. Only UK and EU
applicants are permitted to apply; we expect candidates
to hold (or be about to obtain) a minimum 2:1 Bachelors

at the University of M unster in Germany currently has
available:
2 PhD-Positions in Molecular Protein Evolution (Bio-
chemist/Molecular Biologist)
Project 1: Directed evolution starting from de novo
proteins
The candidate will work on the de novo emergence
and evolution of new proteins using candidate genes
from comparative genomic data and their reconstructed
presumed ancestors, with an emphasis on experimental
characterization of biophysical properties and enzymatic
functions of expressed proteins. This project shall lead
to a completely new strategy for designing proteins with
desired functions \from scratch" by using directed neu-
tral drifts without the need for extensive screening of
sequence space.
Candidates should have (or are about to obtain) a MScor equivalent in Molecular Life Sciences, Biochemistry,
Biology or Biotechnology (or relevant related discipline),
and should have research experience in some of the fol-
lowing elds: molecular cloning, protein overexpression,
protein characterization (in particular enzyme kinetic
analysis), structural biology (protein crystallography or
NMR).
Project 2: Evolutionary design of novel pro-
teins/enzymes
The candidate will work on the evolutionary design of
new enzymes derived from comparative genomic data
and their reconstructed presumed ancestors. For the
latter particular focus will be on those ancestors from
which multiple enzymatic functions have evolved. This
will lead to the characterization of a multi-trait tness
landscape and a new paradigm for the design of pro-
teins and enzymes with hitherto inaccessible functional
capacities.
Candidates should have (or are about to obtain) a MSc
or equivalent in Molecular Life Sciences, Biochemistry,
Biology or Biotechnology (or relevant related discipline),
and should have research experience in some of the
following elds: basic knowledge of bioinformatics (se-
quence analysis, phylogenies), molecular cloning, protein
overexpression, protein characterization (in particular
enzyme kinetic analysis), structural biology (protein
crystallography or NMR).

Biology of the Marine Environment), Carl von Ossietzky
University Oldenburg in Oldenburg, oers two positions:
3-year Scientist-position in Molecular biology (TVL-E13,
100%) (#1)
3-years PhD-position (TVL-E13/50%) in Molecular bi-
ology (#2)
within the project PEKRIS (The PErformance of KRIll
vs. Salps to withstand in a warming Southern Ocean),
funded by the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education
and Research) from July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2019.
The scientist candidate should perform the work on the
tunicate Salpa thompsoni, whereas the PhD candidateshould perform the work on Antarctic krill, Euphausia
superba.
For detailed project information contact Prof. Dr. Bet-
tina Meyer b.meyer@uni-oldenburg.de
Project aim: The overall goal of the Subproject 1 of
the PEKRIS project (\Physiological and genetic traits
of krill vs. salps supporting potential adaptation to
a warming Southern Ocean"), are to understand the
general principles of thermal adaptation of krill and
salps dened by their genetic make-up. It is aspired to
characterize the thermal window of krill and salps in the
Southern Ocean in respect to important physiological
life cycle functions (lipid accumulation and utilization,
reproduction, growth metabolic activity). The goal of
the transcriptomic approach is to identify dierentially
expressed genes which contribute to these important life
cycle functions and new candidate genes of both species,
which contribute to their plasticity and adaptation to
temperature stress. We aim to identify gene clusters
and networks, which dene sensitivity and adaptability
of both species from which almost no (salps) or only few
(krill) essential functional transcriptomic information
are available.
Prole of the Candidates: The successful candidates
are expected to have an academic university degree
(Master or Diploma) and hold a doctoral degree (Scien-
tist position #1) or academic university degree (PhD
position #2) in molecular biology, genetics, biology
or marine biology. The Scientist candidate must be
very well familiar with basic and advanced techniques
to investigate cDNA-gene-expression-proles in inverte-
brates, for example Real-Time-PCR (SYBR Green und
TaqMan Chemie), TaqMan Low Density Arrays, next
generation sequencing as well as bioinformatics, analysis
and interpretation of next generation sequencing data,
multi-variate statistic etc. The PhD candidate must
be familiar with basic techniques in molecular biology
(RNA isolation, qPCR, bioinformatics) on invertebrates.
Both candidates should have skills in experimentation
and maintenance of invertebrates. The international
nature of the project requires uency in spoken and
written English and good presentation and publication
skills. The successful candidates are embedded in the
working group of Biodiversity and biological processes
in Polar Seas, headed by Prof. Dr. Bettina Meyer. It is
expected that both candidates work in close cooperation
self reliably on this project. The position requires the
ability to manage months-long research expeditions as
well as expedition to our cooperative scientic partners
at the AAD in Kingston, Tasmania.
The Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg is dedi-
cated to increase the percentage of female employees in28 EvolDir July 1, 2016

MammalLifeHistoryEvolution
Funded Ph.D. position on the energetics of mammalian
life history variation.
I am currently advertising one Ph.D. student opening
in my lab (www.lanelab.ca) in the Department of Bi-
ology at the University of Saskatchewan. Ideally the
student will begin September, 2016, but a January or
April, 2017 start date may also be feasible. A full
stipend ( $20k CAD/yr for 4 years) is guaranteed, butthe successful student will be expected to apply for any
funding for which they may be eligible (e.g., NSERC
post-graduate scholarships for Canadian citizens, Uni-
versity of Saskatchewan scholarships for international
applicants).
The Project: Energetics of life history variation in a wild
hibernating mammal. Energetic tradeos (e.g., among
growth, maintenance and reproduction) form the basis
of life history evolution theory. Until relatively recently,
however, it has been dicult to measure relevant ener-
getic traits in the wild. As a result, empirical tests of life
history tradeos are relatively rare. For the proposed
project, we are looking for a Ph.D. student interested in
taking advantage of recent approaches/technology (e.g.,
eld respirometry, doubly-labeled water, body compo-
sition analysis) to test and advance life history theory.
The study system is a fully-censused, long-monitored,
population of Columbian ground squirrels. Individuals
of this species hibernate for 8-9 months of the year,
meaning that all energy acquisition and allocation to
reproduction occurs in a short 3-4 month active season.
We have been collecting detailed life history data from
all individuals in a population in the Rocky Mountains
of Alberta since 2003. We have also collected pilot data
on resting and eld metabolic rates, body condition and
body temperature proles during hibernation. These
datasets will provide the foundation, upon which the
student will be able to build with new data collection, to
address their research questions. We have also been col-
lecting data from additional populations, across varying
elevations in the Rockies, providing an ideal opportunity
to investigate energetics across an ecologically important
environmental gradient.

Applications are invited for a three-year PhD fellowship

* Background*Eurasian populations of the past 12,000 years lend them-
selves more easily to the new palaeogenomics techniques.
So far the results have turned to the history of settle-
ment, the paleogeniticians implying that these samples
are representative of the people who lived at some point.
This results in a lack of understanding of archaeologists
and prehistorians who dig sites and who have demon-
strated since 1980 on demographic data that funeral
deposits are generally not representative of the natural
mortality of the population.
*Objectives*
So we chose to study the relationship from genomic
data in the two oldest collective burials known in Eu-
rope (3500 BC. J-C.), outstanding deposits by their
conservation. Currently a thesis on paleogenetic study
of these two burials and it appears that the diversity of
paternal lines is very small and we favor the hypothesis
burial clan patrilineal. We intend to go further in the
study and our goals are: (i) clarify the genetic relation-
ship; (Ii) quantifying the levels of consanguinity between
individuals; (Iii) to decrypt the 'social' dimension of the
Neolithic funerary. To answer these questions, we must
go to the study, not a limited number of genetic mark-
ers, but that of the genome. The relationship will be
assessed through about a million SNPs nuclear and anal-
ysis 'runs of homozygosity' (Identity By Descent) will
allow us to quantify the level of consanguinity present
in individuals analyzed. Individuals showing excellent
preservation of DNA, and a small fraction of microbial
DNA, will qualify as candidates for sequencing the en-
tire genome at an average coverage of at-least 8X, to
genotype all sites polymorphs present in the genome
and to study the ancestry and the admixture of these
subjects.
We are seeking a highly motivated, hard worker and
productive student who is interested and capable of in-
teracting and contributing to a research team consisting
of archaeologists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians,
and evolutionary biologists. The ideal candidate will
show great abilities to work in an international envi-

PhD position Wageningen University (The Netherlands):
Life history evolution in livebearing sh
A PhD position is available in Bart Pollux's research
group in the Experimental Zoology group, Depart-
ment of Animal Sciences at Wageningen University, the
Netherlands. The aim of this project is to study life
history evolution in natural populations of ecologically
divergent live-bearing shes in Costa Rican rivers. Theproject will quantify the relationships between local en-
vironmental conditions and reproductive strategy (pla-
centation, superfetation, polyandry). This will then
be linked to the sh's physiological performance and
tness during gestation. This project will use an in-
tegrated approach to life history evolution in natural
populations that focuses on ecological eld studies and
common garden studies to quantify heritability of LH
traits. Depending on the student's interest the project
can be extended to include e.g. geometric morphomet-
rics, physiological performance studies (metabolic rate,
fast-start escape, sustained swimming ability) and mus-
cle structure/function (immunohistochemistry, qPCR).
The PhD candidate will join a team of four other PhD
students led by Dr. Pollux that studies the evolution of
reproductive adaptations in livebearing sh. The cur-
rent project will take place in close collaboration with
Dr. Andrew Furness (University of California Irvine,
USA).
Requirements
For this interdisciplinary project we look for an enthusi-
astic, result-driven person with an excellent MSc degree
in biology (evolutionary ecology, population ecology, life
history evolution), experience with eldwork (preferably
in the tropics) and a proven interest in evolutionary
questions. The candidate should have excellent research
and communication skills, be creative and independent
(yet at the same time a team player) and be procient in
English (both oral and written). Experience with Mat-
lab (modeling) and SAS or R (statistics) and the ability
to speak Spanish are considered an additional advantage.
OVERSEAS APPLICATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED.
Conditions of employment and additional information
We oer a fully funded 4-year PhD position (1.0 FTE)
to undertake research on life history evolution in live-
bearing sh within the Experimental Zoology group at

UZurich BiologicalInvasions
PhD Studentship in Evolution/Evolutionary ecology
Project title: Understanding invasions - from the genetic
basis to the ecological dynamics of spreading populations
The position is located in the Altermatt lab and the
Wagner lab at the Department of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy and Environmental Studies (IEE) of UZH and the
Department of Aquatic Ecology of Eawag.
The University of Zurich (UZH) is one of the leading
research universities in Europe and oers the widest
range of study courses in Switzerland.
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is an internationally networked aquatic
research institute within the ETH Domain (Swiss Fed-
eral Institutes of Technology).
Biological invasions are among the biggest threats to
natural ecosystems. Unfortunately, the causes of inva-
sions remain elusive, due to the large spatiotemporal
scales involved and the poor integration of macroecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology. Additionally, we lack
an integration of ecological and evolutionary theory
with experimental data. In this project the doctoral
researcher will conduct laboratory invasion experiments,
using the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila
in miniaturized landscapes suitable to study macroe-
cological and evolutionary dynamics (Giometto et al.
2014 PNAS, Altermatt et al. 2015 Methods Ecol. Evol.,
Fronhofer & Altermatt 2015 Nature Comm.), in order
to track and understand the resulting eco-evolutionary
dynamics from genes to populations. During these inva-
sions, Tetrahymena undergoes evolutionary adaptations
that alter its ability to invade which aects the eco-
logical invasion dynamics. Whole genome sequencing
and computational analyses of sequence data will reveal
the genomic basis of observable phenotypic changes of
invading organisms. The experimental ndings will be
integrated into a consistent theoretical eco-evolutionary
framework using mathematical models and agent-based
simulations. This interdisciplinary and synthetic project
will promote our causal understanding of invasions and
range dynamics.
Competitive applicants will have previous experience in
evolutionary ecology, molecular ecology or evolutionary
biology. They will have substantial programming skillsand optimally experience in analyzing high-throughput
sequence data. Excellent experimental skills are a must.
A background in modeling is a plus. Candidates will be
highly motivated, enthusiastic and independent persons
with a passion for science. Excellent communication
and writing skills in English, good work ethics, and
creative thinking are desired. A Masters level degree
(or equivalent) is necessary for admission. The working
language is English.
The project will be co-supervised by Prof. Dr. Florian
Altermatt, Prof. Dr. Andreas Wagner and Dr. Emanuel
Fronhofer. The project will be based at University of
Zurich and at Eawag. Zurich oers a stimulating and
international research environment, excellent research
facilities and a lively and social working place. The po-
sition will be for a period of four years, and should start
in January 2017 or soon thereafter. The PhD student
will be enrolled at University of Zurich and be part of
the PhD Program in Evolution.
The project is nanced by the University of Zurich Re-
search Priority Program \Evolution in Action" (http:/-

PhD Position Genomics of early-evolving reproductive
barriers in orchids
A PhD position is open for a highly motivated student34 EvolDir July 1, 2016
with a keen interest in plant evolutionary genomics,
population genetics and bioinformatics/statistics. The
project seeks to understand the genomic and molecu-
lar basis of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation
and ecological speciation between sexually deceptive or-
chids of the genus Ophrys. In particular, the successful
candidate will analyse the extent of linkage, cluster-
ing and phyical interaction among candidate loci under
pollinator-mediated selection. To do so, s/he will pro-
duce high-quality genome assembly and annotation data
for the study organism using state-of the-art tools and
technology to enable the population genomic study of
the architecture of traits controlling pollination. This
will involve the integration of genomic with various phe-
notypic and Omics data sources. Potential eld/research
stays in the Mediterranean can be accommodated in
the project. For background information on the study
system, please see e.g. Schl uter & Schiestl (2008, Trends
Plant Sci.) and Sedeek & al. (2013, PLoS One; and
2014, Mol. Ecol.).
The ideal candidate should be highly motivated and
able to articulate her/his motivation for this project
clearly. S/he should be well organised, with a thorough
understanding of evolutionary biology, population ge-
nomics and molecular biology, and would ideally have
an interest in orchid pollination. The candidate is ex-
pected to be procient in statistical data analysis, with
a good working knowledge of R and proven experience
in bioinformatics, ideally with an ecological genomics
background. Programming/scripting skills in other lan-
guages are an advantage. Since the student will have
to prepare libraries for Illumina sequencing, laboratory
skills are necessary; previous eld experience is a plus.
Prociency in English and good communication skills
are essential, as is a completed MSc degree (or equiva-
lent) in biology or a related discipline, and the proven
ability to carry out research independently. The candi-
date will be enrolled in the Life Science Zurich Graduate
School (LSZGS) programme in Evolutionary Biology
(www.evobio.uzh.ch/en.html) and therefore must be el-
igible to undertake a PhD at the University of Zurich
(UZH). In particular, a recognised Masters certicate
(or equivalent) must be produced prior to the start of
the project.
We oer a 4-year PhD position at the University of
Zurich, Switzerland, at a competetive salary ( >45
kCHF/year before tax) funded by the Universitys Re-
search Priority Programme Evolution in Action. The
student will be a member of two collaborating labs
at the Botanical Institutes (www.systbot.uzh.ch and

We have developed an innovative approach that com-
bines articial selection on resting metabolic rate with
ecological experiments in eld enclosures. Our selective
breeding experiment has established replicated popula-
tions of mice with contrasting metabolic phenotypes. An
exciting opportunity is now available to lead projects
that use these selected mice populations to test pre-
dictions about i) the genetic and physiological causes
underpinning these dierent metabolic strategies, and ii)July 1, 2016 EvolDir 35
the ecological consequences of these dierent phenotypes
under manipulated conditions using semi-outdoor and
large wild foraging enclosures. These projects would
allow students to conduct unique eld experiments to

a step closer to building the tree of life for all known
species. We will generate high impact ndings publish-
able in top science journals, but we want the results to
reach beyond the science community. To achieve this
we will build innovative big-data and visualization tools
accessible to a scientist or a school child. PAFTOL has
recently secured generous funding from the Calleva and
Sackler Foundations, and we are now ready to get the
work underway. This is a truly exciting time to join Kew
and become an integral part of a high-prole, cutting
edge global endeavour.
The role: Developments in bioinformatics analyses have
not kept pace with the unprecedented technological
revolution driving relentless improvements in DNA se-
quencing and computational infrastructure. We need
someone to apply high-throughput computational mus-
cle to proven bioinformatics workows. You will act as
expert adviser and workpackage leader responsible for all
aspects of bioinformatics development in PAFTOL. As
the project grows you will take on leadership and men-
toring roles for additional DevOps and bioinformatics
experts.
The team: You will join a truly multidisciplinary team
comprising experts from across a range of elds including
systematics, evolution, genomics, bioinformatics, spatial
analysis, data architecture and software development.
You'll work alongside a highly supportive team of Kew
sta who have actively developed the PAFTOL concept.
You: This is not a mission for the fainthearted. You
could be an academic/postdoc who wants to play a lead-
ing role in building a vital piece of science infrastructure,
or a bioinformatician tired of working for multiple mas-
ters and keen to sink their teeth into a single challenging
project. This position oers the opportunity to do real42 EvolDir July 1, 2016
science and deliver a step change in plant and fungal
knowledge. Whatever your background, you'll have an
agile mind, positive approach to problem-solving, and
an enthusiasm for science and the pursuit of knowledge.

ID Norway spruce from photos
Hi EvolDir folks:
I recently had a request from a citizen to identify two
trees recently purchased from a horticultural supplier
as they should both be Norway spruce but look quite
dierent. The owners have photos of the trees or could
supply branch cuttings if needed.
The morphological question is outside my training, so I
am looking for an expert in Picea taxonomy who may be
willing to help, and potentially provide a letter stating
conclusions.
If you are able and willing to help, please contact me at

Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis).
2 Voluntary research assistants
Position 1 (Starting between July and September 2016,
6 month minimum stay required):
This position entails assisting in several studies on hor-
monal eects on social behaviour of mole-rats (Fukomys
damarensis). We are interested in the eects of cor-
tisol and testosterone on allo-parental care in non-
reproducing mole-rats and in the eects of these hor-
mones on developing ospring during gestation. The
research assistant will be involved in all steps of the ex-
periments and will mainly work in the laboratory with
our captive mole-rats which are housed in large semi-
natural tunnel systems. The responsibilities include
behavioural observations, hormonal measures (blood
sampling, urine sampling), morphological measurements
(using X-ray) and hormonal manipulations. The labora-
tory is situated in the Kuruman River Reserve in the
southern Kalahari, Northern Cape province of South
Africa.56 EvolDir July 1, 2016
The successful applicant will work in a team of 5-10
persons. The research station is also the home of sev-
eral other projects studying meerkats (www.kalahari-
meerkats.com), pied babblers, forktailed drongos, bat-
eared foxes and hornbills resulting in a stimulating sci-
entic environment. Around 20-30 research assistants
are based at the station year round. Research assis-
tants will learn a range of skills such as remote sensing
of behaviour, endocrine sampling techniques, capture-
mark-recapture techniques, behavioural observations,
data handling and management, blood and urine sam-
pling and how to operate X-rays technique for research
purpose.
Position 2 (Starting August 2016, 3 months minimum
stay):
This project investigates the group augmentation hy-
pothesis and how benets of living in large groups can
generate selection for altruism in animals. We are cur-
rently conducting a large scale capture-mark and recap-
ture experiment running over more than one year in
which the voluntary research assistant would play an
important role. Field work takes place in the southern
Kalahari, Northern Cape province of South Africa in a
private game reserve. Entire groups of mole-rats will
be captured and individually marked. Morphological
measurements and tissue samples will be obtained be-
fore the release of the animals. The work is physically
demanding (digging to capture mole-rats) and weather
conditions are challenging (heat during the day, cold
during the night). Field work will make trapping dur-
ing the night necessary. The assistant will mostly be
working along one more experienced scientist but will
need to work independently at times.
Applicants for both positions should be enthusiastic,
willing to work hard and keen to get involved in an
ecological research project in the African bush. The
research assistants are expected to work at night when
trapping schedules require it and need to be t as captur-
ing mole-rats requires the capacity to do hard physical
work (digging) in a challenging environment. A zoology
related degree and/or previous eld experience will be
considered an asset. The successful applicant needs to
be a team player and generally a person that enjoyscollaboration and team work.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants
are paid a monthly allowance to cover their personal
costs and food. The bus fare from Johannesburg to
the eld site can be covered but we do not provide an
international airfare, travel insurance, or visa fees for
applicants from overseas.
Applications received until the 15th of June 2016 are
ensured full consideration. Later applications can be
considered if the position(s) have not been lled.
Please apply to Markus Zoettl: mz338@cam.ac.uk; In-
cluding a CV and a cover letter explaining why you
would like to participate in our research project.
Please indicate whether you are applying for position 1
(mainly lab-based) or position 2 (mainly eld based) or
both.

AustNatlU BirdMatingPatterns
Postdoctoral Researcher in Evolutionary Quantitative
Genetics at the Research School of Biology, Australian
National University
Evolution of mating patterns in a cooperative songbird
A 36-month postdoctoral position is available to study
the evolutionary quantitative genetics of mating sys-
tems in a wild bird population. The project would in-
vestigate the evolutionary processes that shape mating
and breeding systems, and in particular the evolution
of mate choice, the dynamics of sexual selection and
the interaction of these factors with the social environ-
ment. It will use data from a long-term study of superb
fairy-wrens, a cooperatively-breeding passerine bird with
exceptionally high levels of extra-pair paternity. The
data-set comprises detailed records on individual life
histories, mating patterns, relatedness and population
spatial structure. The aim of the project is to address
fundamental evolutionary questions about patterns of
variation in breeding success and the role of indirect
genetic eects and inclusive tness.
The post constitutes an exciting opportunity for a highly-
motivated postdoctoral researcher with experience in
evolutionary ecology and/or quantitative genetic anal-
yses. It will involve statistical analyses of a long-termJuly 1, 2016 EvolDir 59
data-set as well as eldwork, in collaboration with
Loeske Kruuk and Andrew Cockburn in ANU's Division
of Evolution, Ecology and Genetics.
Applicants should possess (or be nearing completion
of) a PhD in a relevant area of evolutionary ecology
or genetics. They should have strong skills in complex
statistical analyses; in particular, whilst familiarity with
quantitative genetic mixed models is by no means essen-
tial, it would be a strong advantage. They should also
be able to demonstrate excellent writing skills and a
strong track record of publication in academic journals.
The position is available for 36 months. Start date could
be as soon as possible dependent on red tape, and the
salary would be $81,122 p.a. plus 17% superannuation.

research programs and data sets. These institutions
share common goals towards education, research, and
technology transfer at the highest international level.
The Department of Aquatic Ecology (Eawag) and the
Department of Ecosystem Research (IGB) seek Postdoc-
toral Researcher in Genomics (2-year position) Project
title: Host^ aparasite interactions in hybridizing Daphnia,
from correlations to experiments
The postdoctoral researcher will participate in a col-
laborative research project with PD Dr. Piet Spaak
(Eawag) and Prof. Justyna Wolinska (IGB), nanced
by the Swiss and German Science Foundations (SNF &
DFG).
Eutrophication is a worldwide environmental problem
accelerated by global warming, aecting the stability of
aquatic ecosystems and having long^ aconsequences. We
will investigate if and how eutrophication aects two
interacting evolutionary processes: disease spread and in-
terspecic hybridization. We will use water eas (Daph-
nia), a well-established model in both host-parasite and
hybridization research. This project is a combination
of eld surveys of two eutrophic lakes, a large scale
mesocosm experiment (where trophic conditions will be
manipulated), the transcriptional proling of Daphnia
exposed to stressful eutrophic conditions, and the devel-
opment and application of molecular markers to study
parasite evolution in eutrophic environments. Over-
all, through the unique combination of expertise and
methods, this project will improve our understanding
of disease spread and biodiversity loss under dierent
trophic conditions and, consequently, might provide
tools for management of aquatic ecosystems.
This is a collaborative project involving a team of ve
researchers: both PI's, a PhD student in Germany, a
PhD student in Switzerland as well as this postdoc-July 1, 2016 EvolDir 61
toral researcher (one year in Germany and one year
in Switzerland). The PhD students will be primarily
responsible for processing samples in a molecular lab (as
well as for experimental- and eld-work), whereas the
postdoctoral researcher will work on the bioinformatics
of the project. The rst task will be the sequencing
of the genome of our model parasite species, and the
use of this information to develop molecular markers to
study parasite evolution in the hybridizing host (Daph-
nia). Second, Daphnia will be transcriptionally proled
(RNA-seq) under various stressful conditions (including
parasitism), in order to explore the mechanisms under-
lying immunity and synergistic interactions between the
stressors. Third, depending on skills and interests, the
postdoctoral researcher might also get involved in a
large genomic project, which involves an annotation of
several Daphnia lineages, belonging to either parental
species or interspecic hybrids.
The position will be for a period of two years and should
start in January 2017 or soon thereafter (negotiable).
Generous funds are available to cover attendance at
national and international conferences and for stays in
collaborating institutions. The postdoctoral researcher
will have an opportunity to participate in several re-
search training exercises and workshops to facilitate
career building: http://www.igb-berlin.de/postdocs-at-
igb-kopie.html In Berlin, the postdoctoral researcher
will additionally be aliated with the Berlin Center for
Genomics in Biodiversity Research (BeGenDiv): http:/-
/begendiv.de/ The ideal candidate should have a strong
background in bioinformatics and genomics, and interest
in applying these tools to evolutionary questions. In
particular, experience with genome annotation, devel-
opment of SNP markers, and/or analyses of RNA-seq
data would be advantageous. In addition, some lab
experience would be benecial (but this is not a must).
We are seeking a highly motivated person who has an
ambition to stay in academia. A record of successful
publication is anticipated. We expect strong analytical
and data handling skills, and the ability to communi-
cate within a cross-disciplinary research environment.
Excellent writing skills in English, good work ethic, and
creative thinking are desired. The working language of
the group is English. In keeping with the IGB's policy
regarding gender equality, female applicants are partic-
ularly encouraged. Severely disabled applicants with
equal qualication and aptitude are given preferential
consideration.

Job description:
Two research positions for PhD holders (References
ICETA 2016-52) are available to work on a range of
projects that employ analysis of environmental DNA
to address ecological questions. The post-doctoral posi-
tions will be contracted under the scope of the project
\EnvMetaGen - Capacity Building at InBIO for Research
and Innovation Using Environmental Metagenomics"
(Reference No 668981), funded by the European Com-
mission under the call H2020-WIDESPREAD-2014-2.
The project aims to expand the research and innova-
tion potential of InBIO, supporting emerging research
areas in environmental metagenomics for applications in
biodiversity surveys, invasive species control, ecosystemJuly 1, 2016 EvolDir 63
services assessment, and environmental (bio)monitoring.
The successful candidates will work on one or more po-
tential projects that will be determined by their interests
and skills and the research areas that are developed at
CIBIO-InBIO associated with the EnvMetaGen project.
Examples of current research at CIBIO-InBIO that are
employing environmental metagenomics include analy-
sis of diet of bats and birds by DNA metabarcoding of
faecal DNA; analysis of invertebrate species composi-
tion of rivers, lakes and estuaries; researching critical
components of the diet of endangered species; and bio-
diversity surveying by analysis of the diets of multiple
high trophic level species. Similar research topics will
be developed as the EnvMetaGen project progresses
and the post-doctoral researchers will be expected to
take a role in directing research in these areas. The
successful candidates should be exible in working both
independently on their own projects and being involved
in current and future projects as part of the overall
EnvMetaGen team.
Research eld:

pand the research and innovation potential of InBIO
- Research Network in Biodiversity and Evolutionary
Biology, through the creation of a European Research
Area (ERA) Chair in Environmental Metagenomics and
recruitment of a team of researchers and support sta
to work with the ERA chair. The project aims to
strengthen the research potential of human resources,
lab facilities and next-generation genome sequencing
equipment funded by a FP7 CAPACITIES project,
supporting an emerging research line in environmen-
tal metagenomics for applications in biodiversity con-servation, invasive species control, ecosystem services
assessment, and environmental (bio)monitoring. The
project will contribute to the regional and national
smart specialisation strategies, by developing tools and
approaches to foster environmentally sustainable devel-
opment, and strengthening innovation and knowledge
transfer activities in close collaboration with local and
global industrial partners, as well as with governmental
agencies. In addition, the project will contribute to the
advanced training of new scientists to expand the locally
available expertise in this area, and to the communica-
tion, dissemination and exploitation of InBIO's research
and innovation. These two post-doctoral positions are a
key component of the EnvMetaGen team. These two po-
sitions will upgrade InBIO's research capacity, improve
its innovation potential and through peer reviewed pub-
lication and other knowledge dissemination mechanisms
and better integrate InBIO within the ERA.

Admission requirements
The post-doc fellowship is suitable for candidates of
any nationality holding a PhD degree in biology, ge-
netics, animal science or related elds. The candidate
must have research experience in genetics, including
laboratory skills in DNA extraction, sequencing and
genotyping of molecular markers. It is desirable that
the candidate has experience in ancient DNA method-
ologies (or in the genetic analysis of degraded specimens)
and in preparation of DNA libraries for next-generation
sequencing. Analysis of genetic data and bioinformatics
knowledge will be valued. The candidate is expected
to be able to work independently, to show initiative,
perseverance and to have excellent verbal and written
communication skills. Excellent speaking and written
knowledge of English is required. A proven publication
track record is required.
Project overview and workplan
The candidate will work in collaboration with the other
team members to achieve the objectives of the project.
Iberian domestic animal breeds show a vast range of mor-
phological and genetic variation. This is due to strong
articial selection, however what fraction results from
local domestication and/or post-domestication introgres-
sion from wild ancestors has not been investigated. The
major aim of the ARCHAIC project is to perform a
phylochronological study, by using cutting-edge molec-
ular biology methods, to capture ancestral variation
and to unveil the origins and modes of improvement of
Iberian and North African cattle. A multidisciplinary
approach - merging zooarchaeology and genomics - will
be employed, which is critical to capture the temporal
and geographical dimensions of the history that shaped
the genetic composition of cattle.
The selected candidate will collaborate with zooarchaeol-
ogists to collect Bos specimens for ancient DNA (aDNA)
analysis, and will be responsible for extracting aDNA
from archaeological specimens (i.e. bones and teeth), for
preparing genomic libraries for next-generation shotgun
and targeted sequencing. The candidate will have an
active role in the statistical analysis of the genetic data
collected and in drafting manuscripts for publication.
The aDNA analyses will be conducted in dedicated fa-cilities oered by foreign partners (e.g. AFL-Stockholm
University), thus the candidate must be available to
travel and live abroad for up to 6 months. The candi-
date will participate in informal meetings among project
partners. Participation in national and international
seminars is also expected.

PostDoc: Evolution of Bioluminescence and Vision in
the Deep Sea
The Bracken-Grissom Lab at Florida International Uni-
versity in the Department of Biology and Marine Sci-
ences Program is looking for a postdoctoral fellow to
work on a NSF-funded project to study the evolution
of bioluminescence and vision in deep-sea shrimp. This
position is for 1-year with possible extension dependent
on performance.
The CRUSTOMICS Lab is fundamentally interested
in using genomic techniques to study the evolution
and adaptation of marine invertebrates with a focus
on crustaceans. We are searching for a postdoc to lead
a recently funded NSF project aimed to test several
hypotheses addressing the evolution of bioluminescence
and light detection in the deep sea. As part of this
project the postdoctoral fellow will use phylogenomic
methods to trace the evolution of dierent biolumi-
nescence modes across deep-sea shrimp. In addition,
RNA-Seq will be used to characterize the visual systems
and bioluminescence organs within a comparative frame-
work. Experience with wet-lab molecular techniques,
phylogenomics, transcriptomics (RNA-Seq), large datamatrices, associated analyses and software, and bioin-
formatics is required. Additional experience with visual
system ecology and opsin evolution is a plus. In addition
to research, mentoring of graduate and undergraduate
students and lab manager duties are expected as part of
this position. The successful candidate must have com-
pleted her/his doctoral degree before taking the position.
Our work requires good organizational and computa-
tional skills and the ability to work collaboratively as
part of a team. Occasional physically demanding eld-
work (research cruises) may also be required to support
research.
Additional information on the lab's research, the biol-
ogy department, and marine sciences program can be
found here: and *www.brackengrissomlab.com, *http:/-
/biology.u.edu/ and www.u.edu/ ~marine.
*Requirements*: As a *single PDF*, applications must
include a 1) cover letter briey outlining the candidate's
t to the position 2) curriculum vitae 3) research state-
ment, 4) contact information (email and phone) for three
references, preferably including doctoral advisor and/or
postdoctoral advisor (if relevant) and 5) three relevant
PDFs and 5) All information may be sent directly to Dr.
Heather Bracken-Grissom at hbracken@u.edu. If you
attending SMBE 2016 and are interested and qualied
for the position please contact me so that we can meet.
*Due Date*: To receive full consideration, applications
and required materials should be received by July 5th,
2016. Review will continue until position is lled. The
position may be taken as early as late August 2016 (if
search is complete), but start date is exible (+ a few
months). A competitive salary and benets package will

Post doc position in Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics,
INRA, Bordeaux, France
Job description: The general goal of the research is
to predict evolutionary changes of trees, particularly
European white oaks, to environmental changes using
diachronic approaches. These predictions will be based
on observations conducted in situ in age structured co-
horts of dierent ages (from 360 to 5 years), and in
common garden experiments. Populations that have
experienced the little ice age (360 years ago) will be
compared with more recent and modern populations. A
major goal of the project will be to estimate components
of evolutionary change (selection gradients, heritability,
elements of the G matrix), by analyzing existing ge-
nomic, genetic and phenotypic data in wild populations.
Scientic environment: The post doc position is part of
the ERC project Treepeace (http://www.treepeace.fr/).
The working location will be at the BIOGECO research
unit (20 km south-west of Bordeaux, France: https://-
www4.bordeaux-aquitaine.inra.fr/biogeco eng/). BIO-
GECO is a joint research unit between INRA and the
University of Bordeaux and has long standing experi-
ence in studying evolution of forest trees by assembling
contributions of dierent disciplines (ecology, genetics,
genomics and evolution).
Expected prole: We seek for a scientist with a PhD
degree and experience in the eld of evolutionary quanti-
tative genetics and/or prociency in statistical modeling.
Knowledge of tree ecology and practice of computer pro-
gramming will be helpful. Candidates should be uent
in English.
Application: Application with CV, a brief statement
of research interests, contact information for two pro-
fessional references and publication list should be sub-
mitted in an electronic form to Dr. Antoine Kremer
(antoine.kremer@pierroton.inra.fr). Review of applica-
tions will begin on August 1st 2016 and continue until
the position is lled. Do not hesitate to contact us for
further details or questions. The position is open for 2
years.

We are looking for a highly motivated, creative and
enthusiastic young scientist to join our team \prediction
and management of genome and population diversity in
forest trees" at INRA Orl eans, France. Our ideal start-
ing date is October 2016, but there is some exibility.
Project description
Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable resource of in-
terest for biorenery. However, current poplar varieties
have not been selected for this specic purpose. The
factors aecting biomass yield and chemical properties
need thus to be studied. This is the main objective
of the ANR funded project SYBIOPOP, within which
we have initiated a systems biology approach, integrat-
ing genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic data in
natural populations of black poplar (Populus nigra).
More specically, we are focusing on 240 genotypes
originated from 10 populations representative of the
species range in Western Europe. These genotypes have
been evaluated for the target traits in a common garden
experiment located at Orl eans. They have also been
genotyped with a 12k Innium array yielding around
8,000 reliable SNPs (Faivre-Rampant et al., MolEcol-
Res 2016). Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of
pools of young dierentiating xylem and cambium has
been carried out on 2 biological replicates of each of
the 240 genotypes in order to simultaneously provide
reliable expression proles and sequence variants tran-
scriptome wide. Within this context, the ultimate goal70 EvolDir July 1, 2016
of the postdoc project will be to integrate these readily
available genomic and transcriptomic data to better
explain and predict the genetic variability of the pheno-
types under study. This could be achieved through the
following - not necessarily exhaustive - steps: * Quanti-
tative genetics of transcriptomic data, including marker
based heritability and Qst estimates; * Identication
of polymorphisms associated with phenotypes (QTN)
and transcripts (eQTN); * Identication of transcripts
associated with phenotypes (QTT); * Gene network
inference from transcripts co-expression.
Research environment
Our team has long research experience in genetics and
genomics, biometry and tree physiology, as well as in
conducting breeding programs for several of the main
commercial tree species in France, including the model
species of the project, black poplar. The successful
candidate will interact with a multidisciplinary team of
geneticist and physiologists, and will nd readily local
support on key issues like bio-informatics, if revisiting
genomic data is eventually required, or high performance
computing where the host has all required resources. We
believe our team will make a great scientic environment
for a young scientist. Moreover, Orl eans is attractively
situated by the beautiful Loire River, oering rich culi-
nary, cultural, and outdoor possibilities.
Required qualications & skills
We are looking for candidates with a Ph.D in quantita-
tive genetics or statistical genomics, with experience in
genetic analysis involving sequencing, and programming
skills. Experience with biometrical analysis involving
transcripts is a denite plus. The candidate will be
encouraged to contribute to the scope and reach of the
project by own ideas and approaches. An eventual ex-
tension of the grant will be highly conditioned to this
holder's input. We expect from the successful candidate
to be independent, creative, and with strong collabora-
tive skills.
Terms & salary
Salary before taxes is 2,310.52, the same level as a junior
permanent researcher. Duration could eventually be ex-
tended at least one extra year depending ultimately on
the level of fullment and holder's involvements. Appli-
cation instructions To apply, please send the following
items to Vincent Segura (vincentDOTseguraATorleans-

Subject area
Evolutionary Biology: predicting the evolution of multi-
cellularity
Description of the project
A postdoctoral fellowship position is available to work
on a project examining the major evolutionary transi-
tions led by Charlie Cornwallis. The fellow will work
with researchers in the molecular ecology and evolution
lab and the aquatic ecology group at the Department
of Biology, Lund University.
Over evolutionary time there have been several major
transitions that have shaped contemporary patterns of
organismal complexity. In each of these transitions a
group of individuals that previously replicated indepen-
dently joined together to form a new, more complex
life form. For example, unicells joined together to form
multicellular bodies, asexual organisms combined to re-
produce sexually and individual organisms have foregone
independence to live in groups.
The position will focus on understanding what predis-
poses some species to undergo a major evolutionary tran-
sition, with particular focus on predicting why species go
from being unicellular to multicellular. The project will
use a combination of experimental evolution on target
groups (e.g. green algae), and comparative analyses of
the independent transitions to multicelluarity across the
tree of life using genomic, ecological and life-history data.
This position will provide the opportunity to explore
social evolutionary theory and develop skills in experi-
mental design, bioinformatics, phylogenetic comparative72 EvolDir July 1, 2016
methods and meta-analysis.
The Department of Biology has a number of research
units studying a range of ecological and evolutionary
topics including aquatic ecology, microbial evolution,
speciation, sexual selection, and host-parasite coevo-
lution, and the post-doctoral fellow will be integrated
across these dierent units.
Description of the qualications that are required of the
candidate
Qualications:
Applicants should have completed a PhD in Evolution-
ary or Molecular Biology within four years from applica-
tion deadline. Candidates should have a keen interest in
general evolutionary theory and demonstrate an ability
to be work both independently and in teams with other
researchers, including co-supervising PhD and MSc stu-
dents. Experience and skills in the following areas is
essential: experimentation using algal and/or other mi-
croorganisms, molecular genetic analyses and laboratory
work. Experience and skills in the following areas is
desirable: bioinformatics, experimental evolution, linear
mixed modeling and phylogenetic comparative analysis.
Complementary training will be provided where needed.
Fluent written and spoken English is essential with a
strong record of publishing in internationally recognized
scientic journals. The scientic aptitude and the ability
to develop and carry out high-quality research within
the subject area will be given special attention in the
assessment of the candidate. Importance will be at-
tached to the potential of the candidate to develop as
an independent researcher.
Salary will be set according to the general regulations
for postdoctoral positions at Lund University in rela-
tion to the number of years research experience and
achievements. Applicants should send a cover letter
explaining their background, research interests and mo-
tivation for applying to this position, and a CV that

The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in
Pl on (Schleswig-Holstein) is an internationally oriented
research institute and is looking for a
Postdoc in Theoretical evolutionary biology and evolu-
tionary genomics
A postdoctoral position is available for two years in the
eld of theoretical biology and evolutionary genomics
with the Max Planck research group \Environmental Ge-
nomics" headed by Prof. Eva H. Stukenbrock. The Max
Planck group is aliated with the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Biology in Pl on and the Christian-
Albrechts University of Kiel in the North of Germany.
The position is funded by the German Research Foun-dation, DFG, in the framework of the Priority Program
\Rapid Evolutionary Adaptation - Potentials and Con-
straints". The project will be conducted in close col-
laboration with Prof. Wolfgang Stephan, Museum f ur
Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany.
Background Antagonistic co-evolution between
pathogens and their hosts can drive rapid adaptive
changes in both partners. In this project we aim to
understand the underlying mechanisms that drive
rapid adaptation in two closely related fungal plant
pathogenic species Zymoseptoria tritici (pathogen of
cultivated wheat) and Z. ardabiliae (pathogen of wild
grasses). These two species dier not only in terms of
host and environment (agro-ecosystem versus natural
grassland) but also in terms of demography. Our
previous analyses have documented a high eective
population size in Z. tritici and a strong impact of
natural selection on genome evolution.
In this project we aim to investigate the role of recombi-
nation in rapid adaptation of Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae.
Comparing patterns of genome evolution in the two
species that exist in contrasting environments will allow
us to address the impact of ecological constraints on
evolution of pathogens. We have used a population
genomic approach to infer the genomic recombination
landscape in the two species and show the presence of
dynamic recombination hot spots in coding sequences
in both species. In this project we aim to identify sig-
natures of positive selection in the genomes of Z. tritici
and Z. ardabiliae using composite likelihood ratio (CLR)
statistics and modeling. A particular goal is to infer the
genome-wide distribution of selective sweeps accounting
for demography in the two species and we will correlate
this information with recombination maps to assess the
importance of recombination to adaptive evolution. The
development and application of appropriate models will
be conducted with Prof. Wolfgang Stephan.

Postdoctoral position on Ecological Genomics and Be-
havior in cactophilic Drosophila
The Matzkin Lab at the University of Alabama in
Huntsville is currently recruiting a postdoc to work
on a recently awarded NSF project on the genetic anal-
ysis and life history consequences of variation in larval
behavior in cactophilic Drosophila. I am seeking a
highly motivated and creative individual with strong
quantitative & evolutionary genetics, molecular and/or
computational biology skills to join our evolutionary
and ecological genomics lab. Good writing and commu-
nication skills will be required for this position. Prior
experience working with Drosophila is not necessary,
but a plus. Postdoc will be based at the University of
Alabama in Huntsville and will have the opportunity to
interact with investigators at the HudsonAlpha Institute
<http://hudsonalpha.org/ >.
The funded three year project aims to examine the ge-
netic basis and evolution of alternative larval behaviors
and ultimately in the long term to understand how lo-
cal ecological adaptation can lead to the divergence of
populations, potentially leading to the formation of new80 EvolDir July 1, 2016
species. The four specic aims of this proposal are:
Assess the transcriptomic nature of the distinct larval be-
havior strategies among the D. mojavensis populations.
Determine the genetic architecture of larval activity by
performing a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping
study. Generate knockouts and transgenics (exchange
alleles between populations) of candidate QTLs using
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Use the CRISPR-Cas9
knockouts and transgenics to quantify the functional
role of the candidate behavior QTLs in an ecological
context and examine the life history consequences of
variation at these loci. Additionally, the postdoc will
have the opportunity to collaborate on other Matzkin
lab projects on the genomics of adaptation and the
evolution of reproductive incompatibilities.
The initial appointment will be for one year with the
possibility of renewal for a second and third year con-
tingent on satisfactory performance. The position is
available now and I will be accepting applications until
lled.

Project description
Our ongoing research program is funded by Fondecyt
grant 1130750, and is primarily aimed at studying essen-
tial constraints to adaptive evolution using experimental
evolution (Kawecki et al. 2012), particularly experimen-
tal phylogenies of yeasts. We work in close collaboration
with Dr. Michael Travisano, from University of Min-
nesota (Travisano and Shaw 2013, Ratcli et al. 2015).
We experimentally evolve populations of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae in the laboratory from a single, known, diploid
ancestor and induce population divergence periodically,
producing an experimental phylogeny of lineages, about
600 generations later. Every experimental phylogeny is,
in this sense, a replicate. Using a combination of labora-
tory (plating), spectrophotometric and ow-cytometer
method we compare performance (tness) and morphol-
ogy among the resulting lineages and also with the
ancestor. We store every generation at -80oC so we can
go \back in time" and compare evolved versus ancestral
populations. These data are analyzed with modern com-July 1, 2016 EvolDir 81
parative phylogenetic methods that permit to test the
eects of selection and other evolutionary forces (Hansen
or \OU" models)(Butler and King 2004) on the pattern
of experimental divergence in traits and tness. Thanks
to the small and well-known genome of yeasts, we aim
also at combining these approaches with next-generation
population genetics methods (restriction-site associated
DNA sequencing, RADSeq)(Baird et al. 2008), to iden-
tify genes, markers (SNPs) that constraint or permit
diversication, and contribute to adaptation. Using
these approaches, we are interested in answering the
following general questions:
How the environment constraint adaptive diversica-
tion?
How micro-evolutionary processes (processes at the level
of a population or lineage) impact macro-evolutionary
patterns (patterns above lineage level)?
Does the classic distinction among trait-types (i.e., physi-
ology, morphology, tness) have analogous consequences
at the level of an experimental phylogeny?
What are the most important genetic constraints to
evolution?
ALTERNATIVELY, we also seek a research asso-
ciate who can address these kinds of questions us-
ing phylogenetic comparative methods and data com-
pilations/phylogenies from literature or large public
databases such as megatrees (Hedges et al. 2015).
Required qualications To have a PhD degree in Bio-
logical Sciences, obtained after Jan, 1, 2013 and before
Nov 30 ^th, 2016.
Experience and skills in the following areas is essential:
Experience in laboratory work using microorganisms
OR advanced skills in trait-based comparative methods.

UCalgary AdaptationGenomics
Postdoctoral positions: Genomics of local adaptation
Yeaman Lab
Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary
I am looking to hire two postdoctoral fellows to collabo-
rate on projects studying how patterns in the genome
evolve during local adaptation:
1. Genomic rearrangements and local adaptation:
This project will develop and use comparative ge-
nomic approaches to study whether rearrangements
have contributed to the evolution of clusters of function-
ally related genes (genomic islands, metabolic clusters,
etc.). We are currently working on an assembly of
the tubesnout genome (a relative of stickleback) as a
means of studying if/where/when rearrangements have
contributed to the evolution of clustered architectures
observed in the stickleback. We will also be exploring
patterns in a range of already-assembled genomes, and
there is some budget exibility to play around with new
ideas. Good bioinformatics and R-scripting skills will be
very important, ideally with experience in comparative
genomics.July 1, 2016 EvolDir 83
2. Genomics of local adaptation to abiotic stress in
sunower: For this project, we will be studying whole
genome sequence data from over 600 individuals, search-
ing for associations with environment and signatures of
selection, and developing new methods for data analysis.
It is a large-scale collaboration with Loren Rieseberg
and John Burke, funded by Genome Canada. Experi-
ence managing and analyzing NGS data, GWAS, and
related approaches would be ideal, coupled with strong
R & unix skills.
Positions will run for 2+ years (CAD $50k salary).
TO APPLY: Please send a CV and a short description
of your interest in the position to samuel.yeaman at
ucalgary.ca, along with the names and emails of three
people I could contact for reference letters. I will begin
reviewing applications on July 1st, 2016, but please con-
tact me to check in if you need to make a quick decision.
I will be at SSE and CSEE this summer, so please get
in touch if you'd like to chat with me about it then!

UCBoulder FlowerColorEvolution
The Smith Lab at the University of Colorado, Boul-
der is looking to hire a postdoctoral fellow to join an
NSF-funded project on the macroevolution of ower
color. Research in the lab encompasses phylogenetics,
evolutionary genomics, biochemistry, and comparative
methods. Our questions are centered on understanding
phylogenetic patterns of oral trait evolution and iden-
tifying the mechanisms that underlie changes in oral
traits (http://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/research).
The postdoc will lead research aimed at testing the
predictability of genetic changes associated with the
macroevolution of ower color in Solanaceae (the tomato
family). This project builds on previous research sug-
gesting that, for a given pigment pathway, color evolu-
tion proceeds through a predictable subset of possible
mutations. Testing this hypothesis at a phylogenetic
scale will involve a combination of biochemical analysis
of pigments, oral transcriptomics, and statistical com-
parative methods. The postdoctoral fellow will also have
the opportunity to participate in eld trips to South
America to sample new taxa, and is expected to take
part in several local evolution outreach activities.
Qualied candidates will have a PhD in biology or re-
lated disciplines and a strong publication record. Expe-
rience in plant biochemistry (including HPLC) and/or
analysis of next-generation sequence data is a plus. To
apply for the positions, please send a brief letter of inter-
est (1-2 paragraphs), a CV, and the names and contact84 EvolDir July 1, 2016

Post-doctoral position in Human Evolutionary Genetics
and Epigenetics, Laboratory of Connie Mulligan, Depart-
ment of Anthropology, University of Florida, Gainesville,
FL, USA
Post-doctoral position to work on two ongoing projects:
1) Investigation of an epigenetic mechanism to mediate
the eects of maternal stress on maternal and infant
health in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We
are testing for associations between maternal stress ex-
posures, newborn health outcomes and changes in DNAmethylation and/or gene expression in mothers and their
infants. More broadly, we are interested in the idea that
mechanisms may have evolved to allow the genome to
respond to psychosocial stressors, specically behavior
and complex phenotypes may be shaped by early life ex-
periences that alter gene expression through epigenetic
alterations. See http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/-
10.4161/epi.21180 and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/-
doi/10.1111/cdev.12487/epdf .2) Investigation of ge-
netic, epigenetic, and biological signatures of war trauma
exposures and impact of a program intervention in Syr-
ian refugees. This is a collaboration with Catherine
Panter-Brick (Anthropology, Yale University) to inte-
grate genetic and epigenetic analyses into an ongoing
study to measure the health eects of a program inter-
vention to reduce psychosocial stress in Syrian refugees.
Genetic variants will be assayed to predict the impact
of past stress exposures and eects of the program
intervention on self-reported mental health. Epige-
netic variants will be tested as possible mediators of
the eect of stress on mental health outcomes. See
project website at http://www.elrha.org/map-location/-
yale-psychosocial-call2/ . Qualications: A PhD, good
publication record, and strong background in the gen-
eration of genetic data (microarray, NGS, SNP detec-
tion, etc.) and data analysis (gene association anal-
ysis, regression analysis, genetic ancestry estimation,
linkage analysis, etc) are essential. A background in
evolutionary genetics and experience with methylation
data (Illumina chips, pyrosequencing, etc), RNA se-
quence/transcriptome data and/or additional compu-
tational or bioinformatics experience (e.g. computer
programming, simulation analysis, etc) is a plus. Can-
didates who speak French or Swahili are encouraged to
apply. In addition to the projects listed above, there
are excellent opportunities for the successful candidate
to develop new lines of research as well as productive
collaborations outside the lab.
The University of Florida is a leading research institution

However, its role and frequency in natural populations
of multispecies communities remains elusive. Our model
system is the gut microbiota of honey bees, a simple,
yet highly specic, bacterial community of eight species.
Each species is represented by a multitude of divergent
strains, which can exchange DNA by HGT. The project
aims at detecting and quantifying HGT in this com-
munity using cutting-edge sequencing technologies and
bioinformatics tools. As the project is part of an in-

salps dened by their genetic make-up. It is aspired to
characterize the thermal window of krill and salps in the
Southern Ocean in respect to important physiological
life cycle functions (lipid accumulation and utilization,
reproduction, growth metabolic activity). The goal of
the transcriptomic approach is to identify dierentially
expressed genes which contribute to these important life
cycle functions and new candidate genes of both species,
which contribute to their plasticity and adaptation to
temperature stress. We aim to identify gene clusters
and networks, which dene sensitivity and adaptability
of both species from which almost no (salps) or only few
(krill) essential functional transcriptomic information
are available.
Prole of the Candidates: The successful candidates
are expected to have an academic university degree
(Master or Diploma) and hold a doctoral degree (Scien-
tist position #1) or academic university degree (PhD
position #2) in molecular biology, genetics, biology
or marine biology. The Scientist candidate must be
very well familiar with basic and advanced techniquesto investigate cDNA-gene-expression-proles in inverte-
brates, for example Real-Time-PCR (SYBR Green und
TaqMan Chemie), TaqMan Low Density Arrays, next
generation sequencing as well as bioinformatics, analysis
and interpretation of next generation sequencing data,
multi-variate statistic etc. The PhD candidate must
be familiar with basic techniques in molecular biology
(RNA isolation, qPCR, bioinformatics) on invertebrates.
Both candidates should have skills in experimentation
and maintenance of invertebrates. The international
nature of the project requires uency in spoken and

CEES, Department of Biosciences University of Oslo
A three year position as postdoctoral research fellow in
Evolutionary ecology and quantitative genetics is avail-
able at Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis
(CEES), Department of Biosciences.
*Project description* Adaptive evolution is driven both
by selective forces and trait genetic architectures (evolv-
ability). Additionally, selection itself may alter trait
evolvability and simultaneously reshape the adaptive
landscape that acts back on phenotypes through so-
called eco-evolutionary feedback loops. Integrating this
whole suite of gene-to-ecosystem processes into a coher-
ent framework is a major next step in biology. How-
ever, to date, this framework remains largely theoret-
ical. The goal of the 3-year postdoc project is to un-
derstand whether and how genetic architectures con-
strain response to selection acting on body size in the
medaka (Oryzias latipes). We have been conducting
a bi-directional selection experiment during 8 gener-
ations. Preliminary results suggest that medaka can
evolve larger, but not smaller, body sizes. Additionally,
selection on body size induces a response in correlated
traits (size at maturity, body shape, behavior). The
postdoc will have to manage in parallel (i) continuation
of the selection experiment for further 4 generations,
(ii) develop and improve phenotyping protocols on the
selected lines, and (iii) analyze and model the collected
data.

sible renewal. The successful applicants will work on the
epigenomic evolution of Drosophila sex chromosomes.
We will be using Drosophila species with recently born
sex chromosome (^ a-sex') systems to address: How does
the Y chromosome become heterochromatic? How does
this universal evolution process drive the adaptation
of small RNA defense systems? And how does such a
male-specic arms race between parasitic transposable
elements and small RNAs fuel the changes of the female
genome? The candidates are expected to be independent
and highly motivated, and are required to have a Ph.D.
in molecular biology, genetics or other related eld. Es-
sential qualications include demonstrated experience in
Drosophila transgenics, CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, in
situ hybridization, next-gen sequencing library prepara-
tion (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq & CLIP-seq). Knowledge and
skills in bioinformatics (Unix, perl/python programming
etc.) and next-gen sequencing data analyses (genome
assembly and annotation, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data
analyses) are highly desirable but not mandatory. The
senior sta is required to have at least 8 years' postdoc-
toral research experience.
Successful applicants will receive very competitive salary
and benets and enjoy the diverse and vibrant research
environment of the Department and the University. The

MicrobialEvolution
Postdoctoral position on Microbial Evolution
A postdoctoral research position in microbial evolution
and genomics is available in the Hillesland lab at Univer-
sity of Washington Bothell. This position is part of an
NSF-funded grant to determine the population genetics
governing the evolutionary dynamics of two mutualists
during the rst 3000 generations of their adaptation to
obligate mutualism. In previous work, the Hilleslandlab propagated the bacteria Desulfovibrio vulgaris and
the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis for thousands
of generations in both conditions requiring their coop-
eration and in an environment where they could each
evolve alone. The postdoctoral researcher will examine
the prevalence of coevolutionary processes by pairing
each species with past and future mutualist partners.
She or he will also acquire and analyze the genome
sequences of the entire population of each species at
several timepoints to determine the population genet-
ics of adaptation and coevolution in mutualism. The
postdoctoral researcher will also contribute to the de-
velopment and dissemination of a module on microbial
population genetics designed for undergraduate micro-
biology courses, and will be expected to mentor one or
more undergraduate researchers.
The successful candidate will have strong background in
either evolutionary biology or microbiology and a PhD
in a related eld, and will demonstrate a strong interest
in understanding evolutionary processes in a community
context. Candidates that have experience in population
genetics, in analyzing next-generation sequencing data,
or in anaerobic techniques are strongly encouraged to
apply.
This postdoctoral position provides the opportunity to
engage in scholarly activities with researchers in the
greater Seattle area while living in a thriving metropoli-
tan area in the Pacic Northwest. The Hillesland lab
is located in the Division of Biological Sciences in the
new School of STEM at University of Washington Both-
ell, which is about 15 miles (an easy bus ride) from
the UW Seattle campus. The Division of Biological
Sciences has a highly interactive group of 12 full-time
faculty with expertise in ecology, evolution, physiology,
computational biology, cellular biology, animal behav-
ior, and neuroscience. The postdoctoral scholar may
also participate in regular seminars and research discus-
sions on the Seattle campus. The School of STEM and
Division of Biological Sciences values innovative student-
centered teaching and high quality research that engages
undergraduate researchers. Mentored teaching opportu-
nities are available for postdoctoral researchers that are
interested in developing as teacher-scholars.
To apply for this position, please submit a copy of your
CV, the names and contact information for three refer-
ences, and a cover letter that explains i) why you are
interested in this particular research project and posi-
tion, ii) why you are qualied for the position, iii) your
career goals, and how you expect this position to help
you achieve those goals. Application materials should
be sent in a single pdf to Dr. Kristina Hillesland at
hilleskl@uw.edu. The appointment is renewable for up
to two years with possible extension to a third year.98 EvolDir July 1, 2016

EvoEvo workshop
Satellite workshop of the 2016 Conference on Complex
Systems (CCS16) http://www.ccs2016.org/ Tuesday 20
Sep 2016, Beurs Van Berlage, Amsterdam, The Nether-
lands
AIMS AND SCOPE Variation and Selection are the two
core processes of Darwinian Evolution. Yet, both are di-
rectly regulated by many processes that are themselves
products of evolution (e.g. DNA repair, mutator genes,
transposable elements, horizontal transfer, stochasticity
of gene expression, sex, network modularity, niche con-
struction; ). This results in the ability of evolution toself-modify its operators, hence its dynamics. We call
this process \Evolution of Evolution" or EvoEvo.
Dierent EvoEvo strategies have been proposed in the
literature, including regulation of variability, robust-
ness/evolvability strategies and bet-hedging, but nding
traces of these strategies in extant organisms is dicult.
Moreover all these strategies are likely to interact one
with the others, blurring their respective outcomes.
However, new tools are now available that help under-
standing EvoEvo. On the one hand, large scale bioinfor-
matic data analysis can be used to recognize signatures
of evolution of evolution. On the other hand, large scale
computational modelling of multi-level evolution is now
becoming feasible, and promises to shed light on the
conditions under which evolutionary mechanisms evolve
as well as their consequences.
The aim of the EvoEvo workshop is to seek for a unied
theory of Evolution of Evolution and bring together
researchers from various elds in computational biology
to tackle this challenge. The workshop will take placeJuly 1, 2016 EvolDir 99
as a satellite workshop of CCS 2016, Amsterdam, NL.
The EvoEvo workshop is an initiative of the EvoEvo
consortium funded by the FP7 EU-FET grant EvoEvo
(ICT-610427).
AREAS OF INTEREST We are seeking submissions
that explore all aspects of \Evolution of Evolution",
including theoretical and experimental works (includ-
ing in vivo, in vitro and in silico experiment). Topics
include but are not limited to: - Evolution of robust-
ness and evolvability, evolution of pleiotropy - Evolution
of mutation rates, regulation of variability, mutators,
transposable elements, chromosomal rearrangements -
Open-ended evolution - Evolution of the genotype-to-
phenotype mapping - Niche construction, evolution of
trophic networks, evolution of cooperation - Evolution of
genes and metabolic networks, evolution of modularity -
Evolution of stochastic gene expression and bet-hedging -
Modeling and simulation of EvoEvo, EvoEvo and tness
landscapes/seascapes - Experimental characterization of
EvoEvo - Application of EvoEvo to evolutionary compu-
tation - Philosophical, theoretical and practical aspects
of EvoEvo
SUBMISSIONS EvoEvo will accept extended abstracts
of maximum 2000 words in LNCS format. All submis-
sions will be peer reviewed by at least two members
of the workshop committee. Accepted papers will be
selected for long or short oral presentation during the

Hi Everyone-
We are oering a Fall Workshop in Introductory Bioin-
formatics
Where/when: University of Maryland College Park,
Maryland September 15-18, 2016
The handling of large datasets has become intractable
without some level of bioinformatic literacy. Many bi-
ologists nd that there is a steep learning curve to de-
velop the condence required to explore their genomics
datasets eectively. This bioinformatics short course
includes a rich collection of hands-on instruction and
lectures specically intended to help novice users be-
come comfortable with a range of tools currently used to
analyze deep sequencing data. There is no prerequisite
for this course other than a willingness to learn and to
work hard throughout the week. All workshop exercises
will be implemented via VirtualBox and focus primarily
on Illumina data; however, we will also include PacBio
data during the genome assembly tutorial. Course par-
ticipation is limited to 25 students to ensure an intimate
learning environment. Course tuition is $800 and is
open to graduate students, postdocs, sta, faculty, and
industry researchers on a rst come basis.

Dear Colleagues,
We invite you to the *Teaching Computation in the Sci-
ences Using MATLAB* workshop focused on building
students' ability to solve problems with computation
using MATLAB in their undergraduate evolutionary
biology courses. Quantitative and computational skills
are an important component of current biological prac-
tice, and this is especially evident in evolutionary re-
search. Faculty are invited to join an interdisciplinary
community to explore how their evolutionary applica-
tions of MATLAB in the undergraduate classroom can
contribute to best practices for the community. By at-
tending the workshop, you will be part of a community
eort to bring together best practices and teaching ma-
terials that will be made freely available through the
SERC website. MathWorks (makers of MATLAB ^A) is
sponsoring the workshop.
*Details*

Workshop Description:
The *Teaching Computation in the Sciences Using MAT-
LAB *workshop will bring together faculty from the
sciences, including Chemistry, Geoscience, Physics, Bi-
ology, and allied elds, who teach computation and
quantitative thinking skills using MATLAB. Computa-
tion is broadly dened as using computers in scientic
work to understand and solve problems, or formulating
problems in ways that can be computed. Computational
skills are critically important for students to understand
complex systems, analyze data, and create numerical
models and visualizations-all essential aspects of modern
science. These skills require students to have comfort
and skill with languages and tools such as MATLAB.
To achieve comfort and skill, computation and quantita-
tive thinking must build over a 4-year degree program
across courses and disciplines. Participants will help
build a collection of teaching activities that showcase
computation, quantitative thinking, and applied math
using MATLAB and design approaches to integrating
these skills throughout science degree programs.
This workshop target is 30 college educators (by appli-
cation).
The application deadline is *September 2, 2016*.
There is no registration fee to attend.

Nantucket Phylogenetic DevelopeR
Bootcamp
Nantucket phylogeny developeR bootcamp
We are happy to announce a new graduate-level work-
shop on phylogenetic method development R. The course
will be ve days in length and will take place at the
University of Massachusetts Boston's Nantucket Field
Station from the 22nd to the 26th of August, 2016.
This workshop is primarily intended for evolutionary
biologists with some prior experience in computer pro-
gramming who have an interest in participating more
fully in the community of method developers for the R
statistical computing environment in phylogenetics.
On the rst 1.5 days of the workshop, course leaders Drs.
April Wright and Klaus Schliep (with Dr. Liam Revell
participating remotely) will provide an introduction to
the primary data structures and methods of common
phylogenetic R packages, the basics of computational
algorithms for phylogenies, and an overview of package
development in R, along with other essential topics that
will depend on the prior experience of the bootcamp
participants. Over subsequent workshop days partici-
pants will work in groups to develop small R packages
on their chosen topics. These projects will focus on
adding new functionality to existing R software in phy-
logenetics, and might range from tree manipulation, to
phylogenetic inference, to comparative methods, to phy-
logenetic simulations, to the visualization of phylogenies
or macroevolutionary data on trees.
The workshop is funded by a grant from the National
Science Foundation to Dr. Liam Revell, with additional
support from the University of Massachusetts Boston.
All accepted students will be oered a stipend to cover
or defray travel costs to and from Nantucket, and room

lectures and handouts, food and accommodation for the
whole week. Five bonus slots (reduced fee of R $250)
will be available and distributed to graduate students
on a merit basis. Attendance: 25 Participants max.
This workshop is the third in a series of Porto Alegre Hi-
erarchical Modeling Workshops for Ecologists, started in
2014. Each year we focus on a particular modeling topic
and the theme for 2016 is site-occupancy modeling with
particular emphasis on species distribution modeling.
The workshop will open with a one-day introduction to
linear, generalized linear and mixed models, and their
implementation in the Bayesian and likelihood frame-
work. From day two on, we turn our attention to the
modeling of species distributions, focusing on the pow-
erful site-occupancy models, which deal explicitly with
measurement errors in species detection/non-detectiondata. We rst study the basic MacKenzie et al. (2002)
static model, and then develop a range of variations
on the basic theme, with particular attention to dy-
namic occupancy models, mis-identication models, and
spatial models of species distribution. A large part of
the content will draw on three successful applied statis-
tics books co-authored by Marc K ery and published by
Academic Press (2010, 2012, and 2016). Most models
will be implemented in a Bayesian framework, but we
will show likelihood implementations, too, especially
in the user-friendly R package unmarked. Ample time
will be given for solving exercises, which will require
some experience in R. We encourage participants to
bring their own research problems for discussion during
the workshop; both new and returning applicants are
welcome.

Course - \Introduction to phylogenetic analysis with R"
Delivered by Dr. Emmanuel Paradis
http://prstatistics.com/course/introduction-to-
phylogenetic-analysis-with-r-phyg/ This course will
run from 31st October - 4th November, Millport Field
Station, Ilse of Cumbrae, Scotland
The main objectives of the course are to teach the theo-
retical bases of phylogenetic analysis, and to give the
ability to initiate a phylogenetic analysis starting from
the les of molecular sequences until the interpretation
of the results and the graphics. The introduction will
cover a brief historical background and an overview of
the dierent methods of phylogenetic inference. Dier-
ent kinds of data will be considered, but with a special
emphasis on DNA sequences. The software used will be
based on R and several specialized packages (particu-
larly ape and phangorn). Other software will be used
(e.g., MUSCLE or Clustal) called from R. Overall, the
course will cover almost all aspects of phylogenetic infer-
ence from reading/downloading the data to plotting the
results. This course is intended for PhD and postgradu-
ate students, researchers and engineers in evolutionary
biology, systematics, population genetics, ecology, con-
servation.
Course content is as follows Day 1 - Refresher on R:
data structures, data manipulation with the indexing
system, scripts, using the help system. - Introduction
to phylogenetic inference. - Basics on phylogenetic data106 EvolDir July 1, 2016
(sequences, alignments, trees, networks, \splits") and
other data in R. - Reading / writing data from les
or from internet. - Matching data. Manipulating la-
bels. Subsetting data. - Main package: ape. Day 2 -
Plotting and annotating trees. - Theory of sequence
alignment. Comparing alignments. Graphical analyses
of alignments. - Main packages: ape (with MUSCLE
and Clustal). Day 3 - Theory and methods of phylogeny
reconstruction. - Parsimony methods. - Evolutionary
distances. - Distance-based methods: General prin-
ciples and the main methods (NJ, BIONJ, FastME,
MVR). - Methods for incomplete distances matrices
(NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*). Methods for combining sev-
eral matrices (SDM). - Main packages: ape, phangorn.
Day 4 - Theory of maximum likelihood estimation. -
Application to phylogeny reconstruction. - Substitution
models. - Tree space and topology estimation. - Main
packages: ape, phangorn. Day 5 - Tree comparison,
consensus methods. - Topological space and distances.
- Bootstrap. - Bayesian methods.

SwissAlps Social Decisions Jul19-22
In this workshop we are very much interested in the
evolutionary mechanisms behind social behavior and we
will specically concentrate on sensory constrains. Con-
sequently, we would greatly appreciate the participation
of evolutionary biologists.
THE ROLE OF SENSORY ECOLOGY AND COGNI-
TION IN SOCIAL DECISIONS When? 19-22 July 2016
Where? Arolla (Swiss Alps), Switzerland This work-
shop is organized by Prof. Micha ~Al Taborsky and Dr.
Karin Schneeberger from the University of Bern (CH).
Invited speakers: Prof. Lars Chittka, University of
London (UK) Prof. Rui Oliveira, Universidade de
Lisboa (PT) Prof. Kevin Laland, University of St.
Andrews (UK) Prof. Douglas Chivers, University of
Saskatchewan (CA) Prof. Maud Ferrari, Prof. Uni-
versity of Saskatchewan (CA) Prof. Tecumseh Fitch,
University of Vienna (AT) Prof. David Stephens, Uni-
versity of Minnesota (US)
DESCRIPTION: The program of the workshop will
consist of a combination of plenary talks by invited
speakers and work performed in small groups, in which
the participants will discuss a particular theme together
with one of the invited speakers. The results of these
small-group sessions willl be presented to the plenum by
student participants, followed by a general discussion.
Social interactions are often assumed to require ad-
vanced cognitive abilities, as social behaviour typically
happens among a large network of individuals, across
dierent contexts, and over extended time periods. This
is at variance with the observation that complex social
behaviour can be observed in a wide range of animals,
both in the laboratory and eld. We think that rather
simple cognitive mechanisms can generate complex so-
cial responses.
The aim of this workshop is to discuss sensory and cog-
nitive abilities and limitations of animals in the context
of the evolution of social behaviour. Topics discussedJuly 1, 2016 EvolDir 107
in the workshop will include, for instance: - how social
cues and signals are perceived by individuals - how they
are used for decision making - the role of memory for
behavioural responses in repeated social interactions -
the signicance of dierent sensory modalities for com-
munication in the contexts of conict and cooperation.
These topics are of great interest to students and scien-
tists from dierent disciplines, such as evolutionary and
behavioural ecology, neurobiology, cognitive sciences,and psychology. Interaction between dierent elds
will identify open questions and directions for future
interdisciplinary research

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword108 EvolDir July 1, 2016
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
