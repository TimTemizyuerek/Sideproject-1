Thinking Small: Microbial Diversity and Its Role in
Conservation The Center for Biodiversity and Con-
servation’s Twelfth Annual Symposium American Mu-
seum of Natural History April 26 and 27, 2007
http://cbc.amnh.org/symposia/microbes/ Symposium
Theme Microscopic organisms comprise the majority
of life on Earth–and we are discovering more all the
time. They play a multitude of roles in every ecosys-
tem. While recent attention has focused on microbial
involvement in spreading disease, many microorganisms
are beneﬁcial or even crucial to the sustainability of life;
and yet they may be threatened by human-induced en-
vironmental change. This symposium brings together
microbiologists and conservationists to raise the proﬁle
of these unseen organisms and stress the critical need to
include microbes in conservation research and resource
planning.
Speakers will address the broad questions of how much
microbial diversity exists on the planet; how this diver-
sity aﬀects other organisms, both positively and neg-atively; and how conservation practices take microbial
life into account?
Audience: Scientists from the traditionally disparate
ﬁelds of microbiology and conservation, including bio-
geochemists, marine microbiologists, disease ecologists,
and microbial systematists, as well as conservation
practitioners, wildlife managers, policy makers, educa-
tors, students, and interested members of the general
public.
Website: The conference’s full agenda, speaker
bios and abstracts, glossary of terms, links to re-
sources, etc., will all be posted to the CBC’s web-
site: http://cbc.amnh.org/symposia/microbes/ CALL
FOR POSTERS: The symposium will include a poster

SanFrancisco LandscapeGenetics
Sep2-6
This year the annual meeting for the American Fish-
eries Society (AFS) will be in San Francisco over the
period September 2-6. The Genetics Section of AFS
is sponsoring a symposium entitled “Applications of
Landscape Genetics to Fisheries Management in Fresh-
water and Marine Realms”. Individuals interested in
contributing should contact Kim Scribner with a ti-
tle and contact information at scribne3@msu.edu by 12
January. A brief description of the goals of the sympo-
sium are listed below.
Description
The purpose of this workshop is to familiarize ﬁsheries
professionals with landscape genetics theory and empir-
ical applications to species inhabiting freshwater and
marine realms. One important question in ﬁsheries
management is over what spatial scales are population
characteristics (e.g., demographies, abundance, genetic
characteristics) autocorrelated or non-independent, and
at what scales and by what criteria should populations
be managed? Fish species exhibit geographic struc-
ture at various spatial scales, usually resulting from
ecological, physiological, or behavioral aspects of the
species’ biology that limits dispersal, or as a result of
discontinuities in habitat. Genetic markers provide aFebruary 1, 2007 EvolDir 7
powerful means to address spatial questions that are
important for ﬁsheries management. Landscape ge-
netics provides information regarding how landscape
and environmental features inﬂuence gene ﬂow, pop-
ulation structure, and local adaptation. Another goal
is to identify spatial genetic discontinuities (i.e., stock
boundaries) and landscape or environmental variables
responsible for spatial heterogeneity. Historically, pop-
ulation genetic analyses were restricted to traditional
measures that were performed for pre-deﬁned popula-
tions. Exciting new technological advances including
availability of remotely sensed data, advances in spa-
tial analyses, and hypervariable genetic markers allow
researchers to incorporate landscape features in popu-
lation genetic studies, creating exciting opportunities
for both basic and applied research. Researchers are
increasingly able to test hypotheses regarding land-
scape processes or hydro-geomorpholigical features of
marine or freshwater habitats that shape population
genetic structure. Understanding landscape eﬀects on
genetic connectivity improves insight into fundamental
biological processes including metapopulation dynam-
ics, speciation, and ultimately biogeographical distri-
butions and species’ limits. Landscape genetic anal-
yses also provide information that can be applied to
manage ﬁsheries. Methods can be used to identify pop-
ulations and evaluate the level of connectivity between
them. Landscape genetics can also be aid in the de-
sign of protected areas and identify important linkages
between areas by helping researchers understand what
geographic features facilitate and impede gene ﬂow.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS
Dear Evoldir members
The 5th European Congress of Mammalogy will
be held in Siena (Tuscany), Italy, from the 21st to
the 26th of September 2007. The Congress will be
organized into four sessions: Rodents and Lagomorphs;
Insectivores and Bats; Ungulates; Carnivores, and
15 workshops. Participants wishing to give an oral
presentation or to present a poster should submit an
informative abstract through the Congress website
(<http://www.euromammalcongress.org/index ﬁle/-
home.htm >http://www.euromammalcongress.org/-index ﬁle/home.htm ). Submitted abstracts will be
reviewed by the Scientiﬁc Committee and the authors
will be notiﬁed of their decision by June 30, 2007.
The conveners would like to invite all those with an
interest to join and contribute to the following work-
shops:
W4 - Sunday, September 23: Phylogeography in South-
ern Europe: The role of glacial refuges in shaping mam-
malian genetic diversity
Conveners: A. Grill <grill@science.uva.nl >, E. Randi
<met0217@iperbole.bo.it >
Workshop outline Distributions and structure of natu-
ral biomes in Europe have been largely aﬀected by the
Quaternary glaciations. Aim of this symposium is to
evaluate the evolutionary consequences of Pleistocene
climatic changes, and the roles of glacial refuges in
southern Eurasia as generators of mammalian diversity
for the entire continent. Paleo-ecological and molecular
research indicated that both Mediterranean and non-
Mediterranean refuges hosted temperate species during
the last glaciations. The integration of recent method-
ological approaches to phylogeographic analysis, and
updated empirical data-sets, will led to a deeper un-
derstanding of the biogeography, taxonomy and con-
servation biology of European mammalian fauna.
W15 - Wednesday, September 26: Non-invasive genetic
methods for monitoring populations of elusive mam-
malian species
Conveners: P. Taberlet <pierre.taberlet@ujf-
grenoble.fr >, E. Randi <met0217@iperbole.bo.it >
Workshop outline Recent methodological advances in
non-invasive genetic sampling and genotyping (NGS)
are providing relevant information on individual loca-
tions in space and time, population size and dynam-
ics, sex ratios and genetic structure of natural mam-
malian populations. DNA can be extracted and re-
liably typed from a variety of biological samples col-
lected non-invasively in the ﬁeld without the need of
capturing the animals. This workshop is aimed to dis-
cuss laboratory procedures, new statistical approaches
and research results, and evaluate strength and weak-
ness of NGS as a tool for monitoring elusive carnivore

Evolutionary Change in Human-altered Environments
An International Summit
February 8-10, 2007 Institute of the Environment Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles
Organized by Thomas Smith and Louis Bernatchez.
Human activities are aﬀecting the evolutionary pro-
cesses that generate and maintain biodiversity. Climate
change and deforestation are facilitating the evolution-
ary jump of animal diseases to humans. Fish farming
has resulted in the spread of poorly adaptive genes to
the wild. Introductions of exotic species are impacting
the ﬁtness of native species.
In response to this developing crisis, we are convening
an international summit of evolutionary biologists, con-
servation practitioners, and policy makers to synthesize
current knowledge and to begin to develop plans to mit-
igate the eﬀects. The summit will feature talks from
more than 40 leading evolutionary biologists, poster
presentations, and working groups. A central goal of
the summit is to bring the discussion beyond academic
boundaries to frame real-world solutions to these prob-
lems. For more information go to:

Computational Genetics: a perspective
Celebrating the scientiﬁc contributions of Kenneth
Lange
Mathematical formalizations and computational algo-
rithms have always been crucially involved in genetic
advancements. Gene mapping, DNA sequencing, the
study of population diversity and of evolution would
have been impossible without relying on mathemat-
ical sciences. The recent advent of high-throughput
technologies, which allow quantitative measurements of
many biological processes, only strengthens the integral
role of mathematics in genetics. This workshop will be
devoted to the exploration of present day challenges for
computational genetics, and to the discussion of what
past history has to teach us.
Invited speakers: Neil Risch, Michael Boehnke, Daniel
Weeks, Laura Lazzeroni, Eric Sobel, Ruzong Fan,
David Hunter, Eric Schadt.
This workshop will be hosted by the Institute for Pure
and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) and open to the pub-
lic at no charge. For organizational purposes we ask you
to please register by sending an e-mail to Nancy Hards
(nhards@mednet.ucla.edu).

Developing eﬀective strategies for understanding the
impacts of the spatiotemporal spread of potentially
harmful species in at-risk ecosystems:
The Integration of Theoretical and Empirical Research
Approaches
March 12-16, 2007 University of Guelph Arboretum,
Guelph, ON
As part of the Environmental Science Research Initia-
tive funded by the Faculty of Environmental Science, a
weeklong interdisciplinary workshop will present cur-
rent progress in theoretical and empirical-based ap-
proaches aimed at determining, predicting, and man-
aging the eﬀects of the spatiotemporal spread of po-
tentially harmful species in ecosystems that have be-
come susceptible to invasion because of external stresses
(hereafter, at-risk ecosystems). The appeal of the
broad scope of this workshop’s theme is evident by thewide range of research that will be presented during
the workshop. A group of esteemed scientists led by
keynote speaker Dr. Mark Lewis, from the University
of Alberta, Dr. Marie-Jos´ ee Fortin, from the University
of Toronto, Dr. Fr´ ed´ eric Guichard, from McGill Univer-
sity, and Dr. Brian Maurer, from Michigan State Uni-
versity, will present research based within the frame-
work of the workshop theme. In addition, a number
of University of Guelph scientists from a wide-range
of disciplines will attend and give seminars through-
out the weeklong workshop, which will add insight into
strengthening previous theoretical and empirical work
aimed at managing at-risk ecosystems.

British Ecological Society Annual Symposium
SPECIATION AND ECOLOGY
University of Sheﬃeld, 28 - 30 March 2007
Organisers: Roger Butlin, Jon Bridle and Dolph
Schluter
Biological diversity varies enormously in time and
space. Ultimately, diversity is generated by speciation
and lost by extinction. So, how much do we need to
know about the mechanisms of speciation in order to
understand patterns of diversity? Is speciation typi-
cally driven by ecological opportunity? Does this im-
ply that adaptive radiation occurs in empty environ-
ments and the rate of speciation declines as diversity
increases? Alternatively, if speciation is driven by frag-
mentation of populations or by sexual selection, how
does this interact with extinction to explain current di-
versity? Does speciation generate ecologically equiva-
lent units with equal probabilities of persistence?
This meeting aims to tackle these and similar ques-
tions in the light of recent advances in understanding
of speciation mechanisms and the factors that inﬂuence
speciation rates.
Invited speakers: Jody Hey, Tim Barraclough, Graham
Bell, Tom Curtis, Trevor Price, Doug Schemske, Sergey
Gavrilets, Patrik Nosil, Ole Seehausen, Jim Mallet, Dan

Call for participation to a symposium ESEB XI
Congress at Uppsala, Sweden, August 20-25 2007
“The demographic consequences of evolutionary
change”
Until recently, the population consequences of evo-
lutionary dynamics remained relatively unexplored.
However, there has been a growing body of studies that
allowed a better understanding of the demographic con-
text of evolutionary dynamics. This trend includes new
models, as well as statistical and empirical methods,
designed to assess the role of evolutionary mediated
changes in population demography. This symposium
will bring together people using very diﬀerent systems
and methods in an attempt to enrich our understand-
ing of the demographic consequences of evolutionary
changes in life history, morphological and behavioural
traits.
Invited speakers will be Pr. Maurice W. Sabelis In-
stitute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics Am-
sterdam, The Netherlands & Pr. Nelson Hairston, Jr

nell University, USA

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS - Evolutionary Genetics of
Coloration @ ESEB 2007
We wish to bring evoldirers’ attention to the sympo-
sium on “Evolutionary genetics of coloration” at this
year’s meeting of the European Society for Evolution-
ary Biology (ESEB), to be held in Uppsala, Sweden,Aug 20-27th ( http://www-conference.slu.se/eseb2007/-
index.html ).
This symposium addresses research in a ﬁeld where real
progress is being made in integrating the analysis of the
molecular and developmental basis of the phenotype
with the evolution of adaptively signiﬁcant variation.
This is an excellent opportunity to present your re-
sults and hear the latest progress in this rapidly moving
area. There are three ﬁrst rate invited speakers for this
symposium - Nicolas Gompel (Marseille, France), Hopi
Hoekstra (San Diego, CA, USA), and David Parichy
(Seattle, WA, USA) - and two of the plenary lectures
are by important ﬁgures in this ﬁeld - Sean Carroll and
Michael Majerus.
We would like the symposium on “Evolutionary genet-
ics of coloration” to be as broad as possible, and en-
courage submissions on studies involving any type of
organism or coloration, and from evo-devo to colour
variation in the wild.
Please refer to the meeting’s webpage (URL: http:/-
/www-conference.slu.se/eseb2007/index.html ) for fur-
ther information, including on registration, abstract
submission, and the list of 30 symposia on diﬀer-

HostParasite
A PhD position in evolutionary biology is available at
ETH-Eawag in Switzerland in direct collaboration with
Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO). The study
will investigate parasite (chytrid fungi) driven selec-
tion in diatom host populations as well as possible
constraints on selection. Major constraints that could
obscure selection patterns in host populations involve
gene ﬂow from extensive seedbanks on the lake sedi-
ment and Genotype x Environment interactions. These
constraints will mainly be studied in microcosms in the
lab. Field work - testing selection - is carried out in
a lake in the Netherlands where frequent chytrid epi-
demics occur.
Field work is done at the Department of Foodweb Stud-
ies, Centre for Limnology, NIOO, head Prof Ellen Van
Donk. Lab work is carried out at Eawag in Switzer-
land, Department of Aquatic Ecology, head Prof Jukka
Jokela, where the candidate will be based for the ma-jority of time (location Duebendorf and/or Kastanien-
baum).

able for the project:February 1, 2007 EvolDir 17
“Parasitism and the evolutionary loss of lipogenesis”
In contrast to other organisms parasitoid wasps lack
the ability to store excess energy in the form of lipid
reserves. This project studies if this remarkable lack of
lipogenesis is associated with the parasitic lifestyle of
these insects and how they can avoid detrimental eﬀects
of their strategy. The two most important questions are
what are the physiological and genetic mechanisms un-
derlying lack of lipogenesis and how common is lack of
lipogenesis in other parasitoid taxa. Experimental work
will include sequence and expression analysis of candi-
date genes involved in lipid metabolism, physiological
manipulation and phylogenetic analysis. The project
may start very shortly.
Tasks -Executing scientiﬁc research as detailed in the
project description. -Publication of results of the re-
search in scientiﬁc journals as well as in a thesis. -
Assisting in undergraduate courses given within the In-
stitute of Ecological Science. -Following the PhD ed-
ucational programme as prescribed by the institute.

UBristol AdaptationToClimate
NERC PhD Studentship available from Oct 2007
Supervisor: Dr Jon Bridle Department of Biological
Sciences, University of Bristol, BS8 1UD, UK
Tests for adaptation at expanding and contracting
species’ margins
At least 10% of all species are predicted to become com-
mitted to extinction this century due to climate change.
However, these estimates assume that the ecological
tolerances of species’ will not evolve to accommodate
some of this environmental change. This is because we
lack the empirical data to predict how quickly, and un-
der what conditions, populations can adapt when faced
with rapid ecological change.
In Europe, recent climate change has generated range
expansions in the north of butterﬂy species’ distri-
butions, and corresponding range contractions in the
south. However, the ranges of some species have ei-
ther not contracted, or have involved shifts in habitat
or behaviour associated with range expansion. These
exceptions may reﬂect adaptation at the range edge, al-
lowing populations to persist in previously unsuitable
conditions.
This project will explore such cases in detail to test
for recent evolution at range margins, and to provide
insight into what conditions prevent or favour local
adaptation in natural populations. It will also address
the more general question of why all species are re-stricted in their distributions, given that adaptation
at the range edge is possible in certain circumstances,
even over short timescales. The studentship is likely to
involve a combination of genetic and ecological analy-
ses in the UK and/or southern Europe, and could fo-
cus on the Brown Argus butterﬂy Aricia agestis or the
Comma, Polygonia p-album, for which extensive data
are already available. Alternatively, a number of other
butterﬂy species could also be feasible as model organ-
isms.
Interested students should contact me
(jon.bridle@ioz.ac.uk <mailto:jon.bridle@ioz.ac.uk >

academic referees. They will then need to submit a
formal application by March 15th 2007. Unfortunately,

ULaval 2 PopGenetics
Two PhD positions are available to work with an inter-
disciplinary team investigating the interplay between
water circulation, population isolation, and secondary
productivity of dominant pelagic and benthic inverte-
brates in the St. Lawrence estuary (Quebec, Canada).
The team includes circulation and bio-physical mod-
ellers, a population geneticist, and marine ecologists.
The ﬁrst PhD project will investigate the relationships
between the complex two-layer water circulation in the
lower St. Lawrence estuary and the seasonal popu-
lation dynamics of a dominant copepod, Calanus ﬁn-
marchicus. This project involves the genetic charac-
terization of two putative seasonal population compo-
nents with distinct phenology, estimation of secondary
production, and analysis of cohort development using
stage-speciﬁc abundance. Results will be used to quan-
tify the contribution of each population component to
the production and large-scale distribution pattern of
this species in the area. The candidate must have
strong interests in marine ecology, population dynam-
ics and genetics, as well as skills in statistical analysis
and/or training in population genetics. The project
is co-supervised by Julie Turgeon (Universit´ e Laval),
and St´ ephane Plourde (Department of Fisheries and
Oceans, Maurice-Lamontagne research Institute in Ri-
mouski).
The second PhD project will assess the genetic struc-ture of mussel species in the St. Lawrence estuary in
relation to new annual and seasonal circulation pattern
and larval transportation models, as well as population
age-structure. This PhD project will be paralleled by a
similar doctoral project focussing on demographic and
metapopulation analyses using the same sampling de-
sign. Candidates should have training and interest in
spatial and/or genetic analyses. The candidate will be
based at Universit´ e Laval (Quebec City) and will be
under the co-supervision of Julie Turgeon (Universit´ e
Laval) and Fr´ ed´ eric Guichard (McGill University).
Interested parties should send a statement of interest,
and a detailed CV including contact information for two
references to Julie Turgeon (julie.turgeon@bio.ulaval.ca

ULouisiana Octocoral Phylogenetics
I have an NSF-funded position available for a student
interested in studying biogeography and phylogenetics
of deep-sea octocorals. Many deep-sea coral species
have apparent broad distributions spanning all oceans,
but little work has been done in deﬁning intraspeciﬁc
variation and limits to geographic ranges. Over the past
several years we have accumulated a number of samples
from hard substrates below 500 meters depth. In addi-
tion to planned future collections, these will form the
core of a project to study genetic variability, biogeog-
raphy and systematics. Octocorals have been shown to
have very low rates of mutation in the mitochondrial
genome, and this project will involve developing novel
nuclear markers for use at diﬀerent systematic levels,
including intraspeciﬁc analyses. This project will also
be integrated with the NSF-funded Cnidarian Tree of
Life project ( http://cnidarian.info/ ).
In addition to an available research assistantship in my
lab, the University of Louisiana will be awarding Uni-
versity Doctoral Fellowships and Board of Regents Doc-February 1, 2007 EvolDir 21

Thank you, Anne Smith
A PhD student position is available in the labora-
tory of V Anne Smith at the University of St An-
drews. Please visit http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/-

Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
Revealing gene regulatory networks
Existence of a gene in the genome is not the whole
story-whether or not, how much, and when a gene is
expressed (i.e., transcribed into mRNA which is then
translated into protein) governs how that gene aﬀects
an organism. Recent advances in biological techniques,
such as gene expression microarrays, has enabled the
development of computational algorithms for revealing
the networks controlling gene expression. Such systems
level understanding of gene regulation impacts research
in areas such as development, evolution, and medicine.
In this studentship, you will explore the development
of algorithms for revealing gene regulatory networks
from multiple sources of genomic data. You will build
oﬀ previous research in the group on Bayesian net-
work inference algorithms for revealing gene regulatory
networks from gene expression data, developing algo-
rithms capable of integrating other types of informa-
tion, such as prior biological knowledge, sequence mo-
tifs, protein-protein interactions, etc., into this task.
The opportunity exists for performing biological exper-
iments to directly test your computational predictions,
using our laboratory facilities, which maintain yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to perform genetic manipu-
lation studies. Particulars of the project’s ultimate di-
rection will be modiﬁed to ﬁt student interest. Potential
directions include: creating a generic framework for in-
tegrating multiple sources of genomic information into
Bayesian networks; combining Bayesian networks with
other algorithms to increase recovery accuracy; combin-
ing text-mining for prior information with a Bayesian
network; or further developing biological veriﬁcation
techniques.
The studentship will be based at the School of
Biology at the University of St Andrews, super-
vised by Dr. V. Anne Smith. Applicants should
have a background in Statistics, Mathematics or
Computer Science; or in Biology with strong com-putational interests. For more details, please

One full-time PhD (3 years) and one full-time MSc (2
years) studentship are available for 2007 in the Evo-
lutionary Genomics Group at the University of Stel-
lenbosch, South Africa. We are seeking highly moti-
vated students with either a marine biology or molecu-
lar biological background or preferably both. The stu-
dents will use both laboratory and computational tech-
niques to investigate the phylogeographical patterning
of southern African intertidal marine organisms, by
combining biological and oceanographical information
with molecular data in order to better understand the
processes driving population structuring, gene ﬂow and
speciation among southern African marine species. The
students would register at the University of Stellen-
bosch, but would have the opportunity to spend some
of their research time at the University of Berkeley in
California. Projects would be jointly supervised by Prof
C. Matthee and Dr S. von der Heyden (Stellenbosch)
and Dr R. Bowie (Berkeley).
Research studentships are available to South African
citizens only, although interested international students
for the PhD position are strongly encouraged to apply.
The closing date for applications is the 20th February
2007.

grated in the overall objectives of Projet Grands Singes,
leadership in writing publications and pro-activeness in
correspondence with current and potential partners and
funding agencies. The scientiﬁc supervisor will be re-
quested to take ﬁnal responsibility in Cameroon with
regard to logistics and accountability. Yet, he/she willbe assisted by an experienced Cameroonian team, Zoo-
staﬀ and the founder of Projet Grands Singes.
PGS is an Integrated Conservation and Development
Project (ICDP) that combines scientiﬁc research, the
protection of great apes and other key species and sus-
tainable hunting in the periphery of the Dja Faunal
Reserve (DFR) in Cameroon. PGS uses scientiﬁc re-
search in behavioural ecology and population ecology
as a major tool to achieve long lasting conservation and
development objectives in close collaboration with the
local communities. Great ape research is now mainly
focused on socio-ecology and the human-wildlife con-
ﬂict. However other research projects, even outside the
ﬁeld of primatology are greatly welcomed. The scien-
tiﬁc supervisor will be based in Yaound´ e, but he/she
will join the Cameroonian staﬀ in the ﬁeld on a regular
basis. Hence, the supervisor should be able to work in a
harsh physical environment that requests understand-
ing of the local reality in order to face potential threats
such as poaching and logging.
TASKS Be responsible for the quality of scientiﬁc activ-
ities and output of PGS. Write publications and provide
guidance to PhD students for their research and writ-
ing of publications. Maintain close collaboration with
staﬀ responsible for accountancy and logistics and take
end responsibility for accounts and logistical set up in
Cameroon. Write grant proposals and maintain inter-
national contacts with partners and funding sources.
Represent and report to the CRC of the RZSA.
PROFILE Post doc within a relevant scientiﬁc disci-
pline; Preferably proven research skills in behavioural
and evolutionary ecology and/or community based fau-
nal resource management; Proﬁciency in use of GIS
and related ﬁelds is a plus; A good publication record;
Field experience, preferably in Central Africa; Good
knowledge of French and English; Strong written and
oral communications with the ability to address diverse
parties (e.g. governmental authorities, representatives
of the local people, international partners and funding
sources; national research institutes and universities).
WORKING CONDITIONS The scientiﬁc supervisor
will start on 1 May 2007 preferably, but the position
is open until ﬁlled. The successful candidate will be
based in Yaound´ e in the PGS-oﬃce annex apartment.

France FieldAssist
Field assistants needed
We are looking for ﬁeld assistants to participate
in behavioural ecology and conservation projects
between April and June 2007 at the Research
Station Petite Camargue Alsacienne in France
(www.camargue.unibas.ch ).
Three positions are available in an international ﬁeld
project on communication and behavioural ecology in
nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos). Since 1997, we
are investigating the functions of singing as well as pat-
terns of territory settlement, pairing success and extra-
pair paternity in a study population of about 200 ter-
ritorial males. The project is run by Dr. Valentin
Amrhein (University of Basel, Switzerland), Dr. Marc
Naguib and Rouven Schmidt (both at the University of
Bielefeld, Germany).
To investigate vocal communication strategies of
nightingales, we record songs (including nocturnal
song) and conduct playback experiments. The ﬁeld as-
sistants will also participate in a radio telemetry study,
systematically survey territory settlement and singing
activity, and help capturing and banding the birds.30 EvolDir February 1, 2007
One additional position is available in a conservation
project aiming to re-introduce European swamp turtles
(Emys orbicularis) in the northern part of Alsace. The
work will include caring for the about 80 swamp tur-
tles living in the station’s outdoor enclosures, observing
breeding behaviour, and locating nests.
The ﬁeld site is situated at the Petite Camargue Alsa-
cienne in France, about 10 km north of Basel (Switzer-
land). We cannot cover travel expenses, but we oﬀer
free accommodation and use of the infrastructure at
the research station. Field assistants will receive 400
Euros to cover living expenses.
Field assistants are expected to stay for the entire ﬁeld
season from the beginning of April to the end of May
2007 (for the swamp turtle project: mid May to end of
June). Field work will be demanding and will be con-
ducted during the day and at night. Field assistants are
expected to work on their own at night and thus should
love working in dark and lonesome places only accom-
panied by singing nightingales and egg-laying swamp
turtles.
The language at the station will be English, but in the
swamp turtle project some knowledge of French or Ger-
man will be helpful. The positions will be ﬁlled as soon
as possible. Please send applications in English (letter
of motivation, two references and curriculum vitae) to
the following address:

INRA France CoccidiaVirulence
Dear Colleague
We have a permanent position on “Virulence of coc-
cidia, a parasite protoza of chicken” at the National
Institute for agronomic research-INRA . The young
senior researcher (CR1)= PhD + two postdocs on a
minimum) needs good experience on molecular biology
and possibly cell biology. Additionnal knowledge on
Apicomplexa protozoa (Cocccidia, Toxoplasma etc..)
would be an advantage. Deadline for inscription :
end of February 2007. Contact : Jacques Cabaret :
cabaret@tours.inra.fr. Information on the INRA web-
site.
It is a good post for an evolutionnary biologist because
: i) two types of individuals are found : rapid cycle
ones which are the ones that induces resistance to re-
infection and “wild ” strains that need double time forcompleting life-cycle. This has been shown in several
species (and more easily in rabbit species). . ii) Re-
sistance to drugs is fairly common and thus may allow
sohisticated experimental infections based on virulence
and or resistance to drugs. Jacques

The French Agriculture Research Institute (INRA)
seeks applicants for a permanent position of junior sci-
entist (“Charg´ e de Recherche CR2?) on population ge-
netics of clonal organisms in Rennes (France).
Clonal organisms among which many crop pests such as
aphids display peculiar structure and evolution of their
genes, genotypes and populations that are not fully
taken into account in available population genetic mod-
els. The successful candidate is expected to perform
theoretical population genetic analyses including com-
puter simulations using recent advances in the ﬁelds of
population genetics and phylogeny. Respective projects
primarily aim to assess the impact of sex and recom-
bination on genomes, populations and species. This
will be facilitated by the near release of the ﬁrst com-
plete aphid genome sequence. The successful candi-
date should have a strong background in population
genetics and evolutionary biology (PhD), have com-
puter programming skills and be interested to work
in an interdisciplinary environment. Interested scien-
tists with a molecular genetics background being able
to perform statistical analyses on population genetic
data and with a good theoretical genetics background
are also encouraged to apply. Work will be conducted
in a research team of >20 persons including 9 scientists
with complementary skills in insect ecology, population
genetics and dynamics, functional and evolutionary ge-
nomics. Working place is located near Rennes, in Brit-

InvasionBiology
Permanent position of a junior scientist in invasion bi-
ology, Sophia Antipolis (French Riviera, France)
The INRA institute (National Agronomic Research In-
stitute) is recruiting a tenured 2nd class Junior Scientist
(CR2) through an open competition (appointments in
2007).
Although biological invasions represent a major threat
to biodiversity, human health and agriculture, the criti-
cal demographic and genetic parameters responsible for
their success are poorly known because of methodologi-
cal and experimental limitations. The successful candi-
date will conduct research to estimate these parameters
in diﬀerent contexts of biological invasion, whether the
introduction is accidental as for crop pests, or inten-
tional as for biological control agents. In the latter case,
controlled and designed experiments in natura are fea-
sible to test theoretical hypotheses on invasion biology
more thoroughly. The successful candidate will con-
duct experimental work in the lab (and/or in natura if
beneﬁcial insects are used as biological models) to test
evolutionary hypotheses in the context of invasion bi-
ology. He will also conduct a posteriori descriptions of
invasions using population genetics tools. The aim is
to study the inﬂuence of the following factors on the
success of the diﬀerent steps of invasion:
- genetic modiﬁcation versus phenotypic plasticity
- random (genetic drift) versus deterministic evolution
(e.g. selection) of adaptive characters (e.g. insecti-
cide resistance of pest species, virulence and sex-ratio
of beneﬁcial parasitoids)
- genetic versus demographic factors
- hybridization of introduced populations, successive in-
troductions, and secondary contacts between invasive
populations
The successful candidate will work in Sophia-Antipolis
(near Monaco, Cannes and Nice) France, in a teamof 15 people (Team ?Biologie des Populations en
Interaction?), a description of which can be found

Title: The evolution of the insects from a crustacean
ancestor.
One focus of research in our lab is on the evolution of
the insects from within the crustaceans. Insects dif-
fer from their closest relatives, the crustaceans in many
ways. One particularly striking diﬀerence is that where
crustaceans have a second antenna, the homologous
appendage in insects is absent and the segment itself
(called the intercalary segment) is greatly reduced in
size.
Using comparative genomics of Drosophila and the bee-
tle Tribolium we are identifying genes implicated in pat-
terning the insect intercalary segment. This project will
extend this study to the Branchiopod crustacean Daph-
nia pulex (the water ﬂea which, like Drosophila and Tri-
bolium has a completely sequenced genome). The aim
will be to identify, clone and study Daphnia homologs
of genes with a conserved role in insect intercalary pat-
terning. In the ﬁrst instance we will look for conser-
vation and divergence in expression. Subsequently, fol-
lowing reports of successful RNAi gene knockdown in
Daphnia we will attempt functional studies of these
genes. This will enable us to complement functional
studies of these genes in ﬂies and beetles with similar
work in Daphnia with the ultimate aim of identifying
the genetics behind the evolution of this insect novelty.

Animal Sample Collection
Hello,
I am the only population geneticist at my university
and have been approached by colleagues to assist in two
studies of genetic variation in animals. My own back-
ground is mainly in theoretical and plant population
genetics, so I am hoping someone out there can help
me ﬁnd some good methods for collecting and storing
animal tissues (e.g., which tissues and how much? tis-
sue storage until DNA extraction?) for the following
species:
1. Red-eared Slider (a type of turtle) - Trachemys
scripta elegans
2. Hard Clam - Mercenaria mercenaria
We plan to use microsatellites as the markers in both
studies. Please note that the turtles will be captured
and returned immediately to their pond after a sample
is taken. Any info you can provide on the best meth-
ods for tissue sampling and storage would be greatly
appreciated!

CNRS FrenchPyrenees Volunteers
EvolOfDispersal
Volunteer Opportunity
We are looking for volunteers on a new project looking
at the evolution of dispersal and sociality. The themes
of this work are centered on the evolution of sociality
and meta-population dynamics. This project seeks to
experimentally manipulate parameters in dispersal be-
havior and social aggregations to understand trade-oﬀs
and key determinants of the evolution of these behav-
iors. The project is lab based in nature using Tetrahy-
mena thermophila, a unicellular ciliated protist, as a
model organism. Volunteers are expected to partici-
pate in maintenance of cultures, experimental manipu-
lations, and the best candidates will also be capable of
helping to plan experiments and process data.
This project is run in Dr. Jean Clobert’s lab and stu-
dents will work with both Dr. Clobert and Dr. Alexis
Chaine. The lab is situated in the foothills of the French
Pyrenees Mountains at a CNRS ﬁeld station (Moulis /
Saint Girons). Students will be provided with hous-
ing but will be expected to cover their other expenses.
Work is ongoing and volunteers can begin at a nego-
tiated date. Duration of work is ﬂexible, and while
volunteers are expected to commit to a minimum of 4
weeks, priority will be given to those who can commit
to longer periods.
For more information, please contact Alexis Chaine

chloroplast rRNAs and mRNAs have 5’ caps. Speciﬁ-

that is dependent upon a 5’-phosphate (and the absence
of a cap or triphosphate) to degrade chloroplast RNAs
(most importantly rRNAs) in brown algae. But I’m

Dear evoldir members,
I study MHC and therefore perform cloning reactions.
I found some puzzling results, and was wondering if
anyone came accross the same problem/observation:
I use vector primers (T7; M13) for the sequencing re-
action, so that the whole PCR product should be read-
able. And it is, but sometimes the PCR primer se-
quences are not reproduced correctly in the sequence.
It seems that in 20-30% of the sequences the primers
have 1 to 2 incorrect nucleotides. There is no overlap
or visible contamination, a nicely readable sequence.
I use a proof reading polymerase (Hiﬁdelity, Qiagen)
and the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing.
So, my questions are: Did anyone ever encounter this
problem? How can this happen?
Thank you very much for your comments,

Estimating Divergence Times
I need help estimating divergence times.
I have a phylogeny that has several well supported lin-
eages, but no relationships between these lineages have
been recovered. I want to estimate the approximate
time of divergence of these lineages from one another.
A Likelihood ratio test has rejected clocklike evolution
in this data set.
Given the lack of resolution of relationships between
lineages I think it may be inappropriate to calculateFebruary 1, 2007 EvolDir 51
pair-wise distance measures (even if they are model
corrected) and use these to estimate divergence times.
Also given the multitude of methods and programs
available (Bayesian, Coalescent approaches, distance
methods) I am having trouble deciding what is most
appropriate for my data set and am seeking advice from
anyone who has found themselves in a similar situation
At this stage I am just calculating maximum, mini-
mum and mean divergence (based on model corrected
distances) for all pair-wise comparisons of lineages and
then averaging this over all lineages. This will essen-
tially give me a very rough estimate of timing of diver-
gence. .
I am using only a single mtDNA fragment from the
CO1 gene.
I do not have any fossil or other calibration dates to
work with so I am using the rate of 1.4% per mil-
lion years for CO1 identiﬁed by Knowlton and Weight
(1998).
Some lineages are very widespread while others are ge-
ographically restricted
Any comments or advice would be greatly appreciated

First use of SurvivalOfTheFittest
Calling Darwin scholars
I am trying to clarify Darwin’s ﬁrst use of ’survival of
the ﬁttest’, and have found conﬂicting statements.
Christianen and Prout, Chapter 8, “Evolutionary Ge-
netics From Molecules to Morphology”, eds Singh and
Krimbas (2000), Cambridge Univ. Press provide a
quote from “Origin of Species” 6th Ed, 1872, and state
that the remark including ’survival of the ﬁttest’ was
added by Darwin in the 6th edition after suggestion and
encouragement by Thomas Huxley.
Dawkins “The Extended Phenotype” (1982), Oxford
Univ. Press - p. 179 states that the term was adopted
by Darwin (1866) at the urging of Wallace (1866) - with
both referenced to letters from Wallace to Darwin, and
Darwin to Wallace.
Both may well be correct, but my question is - if the
term was adopted by Darwin in the letter to Wallace
in 1866, did it appear in either the 4th or 5th editions?
I do not have access to these 2 editions!

Genotyping 1000s
Hi,
I’m designing an experiment that will produce a DNA
population consisting of many mutagenized versions
of a 30bp sequence, all ﬂanked by the same non-
mutagenized sequences that could be of any length.
The population will have been enriched for those
molecules able to carry out a particular function (being
taken up by naturally competent bacteria), and then
ampliﬁed by PCR.
We will want to analyze the sequence diversity of this
population, expecting that many (most) members will
have one or more mutations in this segment. I’m hoping
for advice on appropriate DNA sequencing or genotyp-
ing technology.
One possibility would be some sort of chip or array that
could analyze the whole pool of variants, determining
the proportion of each base at each position in the 30bp
we’ve mutagenized.
Because this wouldn’t tell us anything about the cor-
relations between variation at diﬀerent positions, we’d
also want to sequence/genotype some (say 1000?) of
the mutagenized segments.
I’d appreciate suggestions of eﬃcient ways to collect
this information.
Thanks,

Grand Canyon Age

tional Park policy, I would appreciate your inform-
ing it. Here is an excerpt from the “Public Employ-
ees for Environmental Responsibility” website ( http:/-
/www.peer.org/news/news id.php?row id1).
“Grand Canyon National Park is not permitted to give
an oﬃcial estimate of the geologic age of its principal
feature, due to pressure from Bush administration ap-
pointees. Despite promising a prompt review of its ap-
proval for a book claiming the Grand Canyon was cre-
ated by Noah’s ﬂood rather than by geologic forces,
more than three years later no review has ever been
done and the book remains on sale at the park, accord-
ing to documents released today by Public Employees
for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).” (from De-
cember 28, 2006 release)
Some scientists might like to write their congressional
representatives about this.

The herring gull complex is not a ring species.
Liebers D, de Knijﬀ P, Helbig AJ.
Institute of Zoology, University of Greifswald, Vogel-
warte Hiddensee, 18565 Kloster, Germany.
Under what circumstances speciation in sexually repro-
ducing animals can occur without geographical disjunc-
tion is still controversial. According to the ring-species
model, a reproductive barrier may arise through ’iso-
lation by distance’ when peripheral populations of a
species meet after expanding around some uninhabit-
able barrier. The classical example of this kind of spe-
ciation is the herring gull (Larus argentatus) complex,
with a circumpolar distribution in the Northern Hemi-
sphere. Based on mitochondrial DNA variation among
21 gull taxa, we show that members of this complex
diﬀerentiated largely in allopatry following multiple vi-
cariance and long-distance-colonization events, not pri-
marily through isolation by distance. Reproductive iso-
lation evolved more rapidly between some lineages than
between others, irrespective of their genetic distance.
Extant taxa are the result of divergent as well as reticu-
late evolution between two ancestral lineages originally
separated in a North Atlantic refugium and a continen-
tal Eurasian refugium, respectively. Continental birds
expanded along the entire north Eurasian coast and
via Beringia into North America. Contrary to the ring-
species model, we ﬁnd no genetic evidence for a closure
of the circumpolar ring through colonization of Europe
by North American herring gulls. However, closure of
the ring in the opposite direction may be imminent,
with lesser black-backed gulls about to colonize North
America.

Is Ploidy Ecological
Dear EvolDir members,54 EvolDir February 1, 2007
I am struggling with a general conceptual question
about polyploidy, and I would like to hear some expert
opinions.
What do you think about the following argument:
(1) Ploidy is an ecological trait (because it has got to
do with genetic variability, adaptability, etc) (2) There-
fore, diﬀerent ploidy levels (across species) represent
diﬀerent ecological functions/niches (3) Therefore, if
the ploidy levels in a ﬂora become more similar due to
biological invasions, then this ﬂora is becoming more
ecologically/functionally similar
In other words: can I use the absolute numbers 2, 3,
4, 6, 8 of ploidy levels as if I was analyzing diﬀerent
growth form strategies or pollination types?
I would be grateful for any comments.
Thanks in advance,

Is Ploidy Ecological Answers
Dear all,
since several people have asked me to do so, I have put
together all responses that I got about my ?Is ploidy
an ecological trait?? question. Half of them are com-
ments that I received from EvolDir readers. I have
also directly written to a few people who I regard as
polyploidy experts, and to the Pigliucci lab, where I
have been a postdoc until recently. I?ve added their
responses, too. For the sake of simplicity, I have cut
oﬀ Greetings and regards but left the scientiﬁc answers
unchanged.
For those who have no time, a quick subjective sum-
mary of the answers:
* ploidy is a genomic trait, not an ecological one * in
many cases, ploidy DOES aﬀect important ecological
traits. Sometimes, however, it doesn?t * studying the
relationship between ploidy levels and ecological traits
is most interesting and meaningful if comparisons are
made within the same species or within a group ofclosely related species * However, even in this case, the
relationship between ploidy and traits is sometimes un-
predictable * ?Diﬀerent ploidy levels = diﬀerent ecolog-
ical niches? is too simple and too optimistic. Across
species, it is almost certainly wrong * Because of their
frequent reproductive isolation, diﬀerent ploidy levels
within the same species might sometimes act like dif-
ferent species. Therefore one cannot draw a strict line
?within-species comparisons yes, across-species no?
Thanks again for your interest and your comments.
This was a great help to me.

I don’t know if I understood your argument correctly,
but I’ll try to give you an opinion, as this is something
I’m currently working on right now. I have encountered
ploidy “problems” in two of the models I wok with: the
olive tree and Dactylis glomerata. In the case of the
olive tree poliploidization led to the formation of diﬀer-
ent subspecies, but there not seems to be any kind of
ecollogical diﬀerentiation, to the best of my knowledge
it seems to be the outcome of a very long and complex
history of genetic isolation and reticulation.
For Dactylis there it appears that polyploidization
could have, to some extent, ecological relevance. Poly-
ploid individuals do seem to outperform diploids in theFebruary 1, 2007 EvolDir 55
colonization of “harsh” environmets, such as roadsides.
They are bigger, grow faster, have longer vegetative
periods and produce more seeds, which might imply a
higher ﬁtness. However, diplois are still there, they are
never displaced by the polyploids so... I really don’t
know what to think. In any case, I think that consid-
ering ploidy levels as straightforward ecolgical trait is
very, very risky.

Matthias Stoeck Dept. Ecology & Evolution University

>(1) Ploidy is an ecological trait (because it has got
to do with genetic >variability, adaptability, etc)
By deﬁnition, ploidy is, of course, a genetic trait [even
if, as many genetic traits, it may be selected for by eco-
logical conditions]. As you probably know, very often,
allopolyploidy includes hybridization!
>(2) Therefore, diﬀerent ploidy levels (across species)
represent >diﬀerent ecological functions/niches
The big question here is the species concept. Usually,
diﬀerent ploidy levels imply some amount of genetic
change (Pikaard, 1999) in the whole genome and there-
fore some amount of reproductive isolation (see also
Ramsey & Schemske 2002). Thus, there is usually no
panmixia as in populations of individuals with the same
ploidy. Rather, it is what Rieseberg may call “porous
gene pools” of collectively evolving species, i.e. some
amount of exchange although the diﬀerent incipient
species do not merge anymore, but may even diverge
further.
>(3) Therefore, if the ploidy levels in a ﬂora become
more similar
?? I am not sure what you mean by that?? E.g. every-
one is 4n??
>due to biological invasions
Which is surprising enough....How? Through hy-
bridization or selection??

Compiled and edited by Katherine J Willis, Lind-

International targets set for reducing the rate of bio-
diversity loss the 2010 target and ensuring environ-
mental stability (Millennium Development Goals)have
helped to focus the eﬀorts of the scientiﬁc community
on providing the data necessary for their implementa-
tion. The urgency of these goals, coupled with the in-
creased rate of habitat alteration worldwide, has meant
that actions have largely not taken into account the in-
creasing body of data about biodiversity change in the
past.
We know a lot about how our planet has been al-
tered and recovered in the past, both in deep time
and through prehistory. Linking this knowledge to con-
servation action has not been widely practiced, by ei-
ther the palaeo-ecology or the conservation communi-
ties. Long-term data, however, have much to oﬀer cur-
rent conservation practice, and in the papers for this
volume, we have tried to bring together a variety of dif-
ferent perspectives as to how this might happen in the
most eﬀective way. We also identify areas for produc-
tive collaboration and some key synergies for work in
the near future to enable our knowledge of the past to
be used for conservation action in the here and now.
Lateral thinking, across knowledge systems and with
open-mindness about bridging data gaps, will be neces-
sary for our accumulating knowledge about out planets
past to be brought to bear on our attempts to conserve
it in the future.

Russian Scopes Trial
There is a kind of Russian Scopes Trial going on in St.
Petersburg. There has been very little material in en-
glish about the trial, except a few short news pieces
and a letter in Nature. Apparently it has been widely
covered in the Russian media.
Today there is a long story in the Baltimore Sun that
gives more details:

Sequencing strategy advice
Dear evoldir members,
We are about sequence a set of genes from two non-
model species (brown algae of the genus Fucus) with
the aim of testing them for selective neutrality. Since
I’m new to this kind of analysis, I’d like to solicit advice
and hopefully avoid any pitfalls.
Speciﬁcally, we are thinking of directly sequencing PCR
products to maximise the number of genes we can
cover. Because the organism is diploid, this means we
won’t have access to the underlying haplotypes when
we encounter heterozygotes. My impression is that this
won’t be a problem for analyses based on McDonald-
Kreitman style tables. However, if anyone out there
can see a ﬂaw in this plan, I’d appreciate hearing from
you so I can ﬁx it.
Thanks in advance,

Software MrMTgui 1 01
Hello everyone
I recently released an small upgrade to MrMTgui, an in-
terface program for ModelTest and MrModelTest. The
new version 1.01, addresses two minor bugs:
- AIC and BIC calculations can be done at the same
time and the resulting PAUP block can be selected by
the user before parsing it in the Nexus ﬁle
- there is no need to restart the program to run ﬁles
consecutively
- the PAUP block insertion option now inserts the re-
sults without checking for the existence of blocks in the
ﬁle. This is to prevent some errors that were occur-
ring. I am working on a better solution to insert PAUP
blocks in the NEXUS ﬁles.
I also ﬁxed some minor bugs and decreased the total
executable size. Also if you already have MrMTgui in-
stalled its un-installation is not required to install the
new version.
This new version as usual is available at
http://www.genedrift.org/mtgui.php If you are inter-
ested in the source code, let me know. It is also avail-
able at a SVN/trac repository and if you need help get-February 1, 2007 EvolDir 59

version is meant to be compiled on Linux systems with

SouthAfrica VolunteerFieldAssist
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Whereas the research is
mainly non-invasive, this is no job for extreme animal
right persons (we take tissue and blood samples). Hard
working conditions will await applicants, as the study
species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock),
and stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
ﬁeld will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
500 (around 70 Euro) must be paid for accommodation
at the research station. Students must buy their own
food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 1500 or 200
Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect to
pay about 300 Euros per month.
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: Staring middle of May/ beginning
of June 2007 for a minimum of 2 months and up to six
months or longer.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to info@stripedmouse.com.

Sponge Barcoding Database
launched60 EvolDir February 1, 2007
[apologies for cross-posting]
Dear colleagues, the Sponge Barcoding Database
(SBD) has been launched and can be accessed via the
’Data’ button at the Sponge Barcoding Project’s web-
site ( www.spongebarcoding.org ).
Sponges are among the most ancestral metazoans and
are notoriously diﬃcult to identify, even by taxonomic
experts due to their depauperate suite of complex mor-
phologial characters. However, as a group they are
highly diverse, ecologically important and of signiﬁcant
commercial importance to the pharmaceutical and bio-
materials industry. Therefore, means of unambiguous
identiﬁcations are urgently needed. Sponge DNA sig-
nature sequences (DNA barcodes) will provide a set of
indispensable tools to aid taxonomists and ecologists
in the identiﬁcation of sponge species, and will enhance
the discovery of drug-producing species.
The Sponge Barcoding Database (SBD) has been de-
veloped with the aim to function as the primary ac-
cess point for DNA signature sequences together with
providing information on conventional morphological
taxonomic characters to aid species discovery, descrip-
tion and characterization. The unique combination
of sponge-speciﬁc conventional taxonomic information
and DNA signature sequences is the distinguishing fea-
ture, in which the SBD diﬀers from other database
systems, such as Genbank or the Barcode of Life
Data Systems. While records of the SBD will be
linked with both databases in the future, both do
not provide the desired ﬂexibility and have the de-
sired options available, e.g. they do not provide ﬁelds
to store more detailed (morphological) taxonomic de-
scriptions. An additional backbone for nomenclato-
rial and taxonomical entries is the cross-linking to the
World Porifera Database (WPD, http:// www.vliz.be/-
vmdcdata/porifera/index.php ) which will provide the
ultimate taxonomic authority with regards to accepted
species names.
Currently, the SBD provides two categories of records:
REFERENCE: records from described species with a
full taxonomic description, DNA signature sequence(s),
and veriﬁcation of voucher material by a recognized
taxonomic expert. SUBMITTED: records from de-
scribed species that either lack full taxonomic descrip-
tion or veriﬁcation by a taxonomic expert, or DNA sig-
nature sequences from as yet undescribed and unveri-
ﬁed species. We strongly suggest using those records
only for comparative purposes and NOT for species
identiﬁcation.
The SBD does not contain many entries yet, but will
be populated soon, e.g. with numerous records fromthe Caribbean coral reefs which have generously been
provided by Sandra Duran.
To check out the functionality of the SBD, search for
“Astrosclera” as genus name on the search page or click
on ’Specimen list’. Then click on the record number
on the results page to view the record. The page of
the record is a condensed view, click on ’show/hide’ to
see expanded views of the ’Morphological description’,
’Reference’, or ’Associated DNA Sequences’. A click
on the latitude/longitude data opens up Google Maps
where the exact sample location is displayed on a map
and/or satellite image. DNA signature sequences can
be downloaded in FASTA format.
We sincerely hope to provide a useful service for the sci-
entiﬁc community with the Sponge Barcoding Project
and its Database, however, its success critically depends
on the data YOU submit!
To submit records to the SBD you should follow the
guidelines and use the Excel spreadsheet template we
provide on the ’Data’ page (to be found below the ’Go’
button). Each record should contain a morphologi-
cal description and species identiﬁcation, which will be
veriﬁed by an acknowledged taxonomic expert for the
group before its status is set to REFERENCE.
I would like to acknowledge Christian Menke contri-
bution of programming of the SBD, several members
of the SBP steering group for help and advice in im-
plementing the structure of the SBD, especially Dirk
Erpenbeck, Bob Thacker and Joe Lopez and of course
Sandra Duran for providing her database.
Best regards, and happy new year!

Standardized genetic diﬀerentiation
Dear EvolDir Members,
We have received many questions about the standard-
ized measure of genetic diﬀerentiation (Hedrick, 2005.
Evolution 59:1633-1638). We would like to thank all
the people that have contacted us and hope that our
responses have been useful. Most questions focused
on how to calculate the maximum genetic diﬀerenti-
ation for actual data using this measure. We therefore
thought it would be appreciated if we also explain this
in a message to the EvolDir list.
To calculate the maximum genetic diﬀerentiation for
any set of data (using GST or other genetic diﬀeren-
tiation measures), it suﬃces to recode the data and
make every allele category in each population unique
and then calculate the genetic diﬀerentiation. To ob-
tain the standardized measure of genetic diﬀerentiation,
one should then divide the original value by the value
obtained from the maximum value as calculated from
the recoded dataset.
Recently, the standardization approach was extended
to AMOVA (Meirmans, 2006. Evolution 60:1399-
1402). In addition to the Mac-only software to per-
form a standardized AMOVA, as mentioned in this ar-
ticle, there is now a program (called RecodeData) to
recode Fstat-input ﬁles to make every allele unique
in each population. Using RecodeData, you can
use Fstat or, after conversion, any other program
to calculate the maximum value of FST and thus
the standardized coeﬃcient. RecodeData is available
for both Mac and Windows and the source-code is
available for users of other operating systems. You
can ﬁnd the software and a short manual online on:

phedrick/ philip.hedrick@asu.eduStoring Fish DNA
Dear EVOLDIR-members,
In view of a future research campaign aiming at catch-
ing and analyzing marine ﬁsh eggs and larvae (besides
other plankton species),I would like to know which is
the best storage liquid/buﬀer to use to enable multiple
analyses, such as gene expression, DNA sequencing and
fragment analysis, but also morphological analyses for
taxonomy and egg developmental stage.
As for gene expression, no real other choice is available
than RNAlator (selected species will thus be rapidly
sorted and preserved), for the other samples there are
several options: pure ethanol (morphology excluded),
DMSO (no morphology, but unstable at high temper-
atures), freezing at -20 C and sorting everything later,
or using buﬀered formaldehyde (4 %). The latter has
been shown to yield good ampliﬁcation success, en-
abling parallel morphological analyses. Another pos-
sibility is to directly split the samples in 2-3 batches to
be preserved separately (ethanol + buﬀered formalde-
hyde for instance)
I would thus be very interested and happy to hear
some opinions or better receive some advice/new re-
sults/papers on this issue.
I thank you a lot in advance and hope to receive more
info soon
sincerely,

TissueStorage DNAextraction
Dear Colleagues,
I would like to ask for any advice on long term storage
and DNA extraction of/from mammalian tissue (rodent
heart, lung, liver, spleen, muscle, etc.) samples. We62 EvolDir February 1, 2007
have the experience that storing our samples at 4de-
grees in 70% ethanol results in a high amount of DNA
degradation after even one year. Is it recommended
to extract all the DNA from the tissues while they are
fresh and keep it all in solution at -80 and do away
with tissue storage all together or are there any pre-
ferred methods of tissue storage (with respect to DNA
preservation). Does anyone simply freeze their tissue?
Any advice is appreciated.

=====
Joshua R. Whorley At the Burke Museum we simply
freeze our tissues at -80. We have good success extract-ing high quality DNA years after collection.
Mark Schultz Yes, I just freeze my tissues. 70% EtOH
works well too, but an acid water content may hydrolyse
the DNA. Apparently, 95% EtOH is better but 100%
is not optimal as it contains Benzine to strip the ﬁnal
5% water content from the Ethanol. Once the DNA
is extracted, TE buﬀer is good for long term storage,
as is water at neutral pH and freezing (we do it at -
18 degC). Repeated freeze-thawing also causes DNA
fragmentation. Some citations that might be useful,
although they do refer to invertebrates:

aﬀecting mitochondrial DNA quality from museum pre-
served Drosophila simulans. Entomologia Experimen-
talis Et Applicata, 98, 279-283.
J. Albert Vallunen We’ve had similar problems in our
lab with ﬁsh tissues. 5 to 10 year old ethanol-stored
samples have degraded virtually all of their DNA. It
seems that ethanol concentration has also a role in this:
70% ethanol seems to be too diluted to preserve the
tissue, especially if the piece is big and moist to be-
gin with. On the other hand, using 100 proof EtOH
ﬁxes the tissue too much pretty soon. Therefore using
ethanol which is 90-96% might yield better results (but
we’ll have to wait for 5 years to see if it actually works).
As a solution to all this we are also thinking about ex-
tracting all of the DNA in one go and then storing it
in -80. But because extracting DNA from all of our
thousands of samples is a huge task I’d be interested in
hearing any (hopefully diﬀerent) solutions you receive.
Gregory Maes we never keep tissue on 70 % ethanol for
DNA analysis. It indeed simply degrades very fast (only
used for morphological sample preservation) ! It should
be around 95 % not less ! This gives very good preser-
vation conditions, even more when put in the fridge of
-20 &deg;C.
However, it can still degrade and the best is indeed to
purify at least once the tissue and store high quality
DNA in -80 &deg;C (in TE buﬀer or ddH2O) or you
coudl try to store it on the Whatman FTA papers used
in forensics. They seem to have a good yield afterwards,
but you should test this ﬁrst.
Francois Pompanon for frog tissue samples we saw that
preservation in silica gel was better than in ethanol. As
in your case ethanol-preserved samples showed degra-
dation that did not allowed AFLP ﬁngerprinting. How-February 1, 2007 EvolDir 63
ever I think that the best solution is to extract the DNA
as soon as possible after sampling.
B. L. Cohen I doubt if you will ﬁnd any widely appli-
cable consensus.
I have some brachiopod and phoronid DNAs that have
been stored as ethanol pellets under 70% at 4C for al-
most 20 years and when redissolved and cleaned up give
ampliﬁable 1kb+ products. Similarly some, but not all,
brachiopod tissues at 4C have been usable after ~20 yrs.
But being scared I keep most at -20, also under ethanol.
I ran an enquiry recently about buﬀering the ethanol
(perhaps important for me because of calcite shells) and
learned from one or two replies, especially from Blair
Hedges (tetrapods mainly), that some people do buﬀer
70% for long-term tissue storage, e.g. dilute the ethanol
with 1 x TE. That seems like a sound practice. There
is one literature reference suggesting that isopropanol
is NOT a good idea. My experience with it is mixed,
perhaps because industrial grade, which I had to use in
New Zealand, is contaminated with metals.
Joel Anderson I would recommend freezing two tissue
samples per specimen, in cryotubes at -80, without any
solution or ethanol (i.e. freeze only the tissue). In the
past, I have kept two samples; one sample is a

International Master’s Programme in Ecology and Evo-
lution
The Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies at
the University of Groningen (Netherlands) organizes a
highly successful master’s programme on the interface
between ecology and evolution. This two-year “top
master” programme is designed to provide an opti-
mal preparation for a subsequent PhD programme and
eventually for a scientiﬁc career in academic research.
Through intensive student-teacher interaction during
courses, seminars, practicals and individual research
projects, students get an intense training in modern re-
search paradigms and techniques. Much emphasis willbe placed on the development of critical thinking and
the training in “soft skills” like eﬃcient communication
or writing grant proposals. The programme is highly
selective and aimed at the brightest and most ambi-
tious students from all over the world. A fellowship,
covering tuition and subsistence costs, may be made

cloning artefacts Answers
Dear evoldir members,
A week ago I posted a question regarding incorrect re-
produced PCR primer sequences after cloning and se-
quencing. I received many informative and interesting
answers and comments, so that I could solve my prob-
lem! Thanks to everyone helping me! I collected the
comments and would like to share them with you:
My query was:
“I study MHC and therefore perform cloning reactions.
I found some puzzling results, and was wondering if
anyone came accross the same problem/observation: I
use vector primers (T7; M13) for the sequencing reac-
tion, so that the whole PCR product should be read-
able. And it is, but sometimes the PCR primer se-
quences are not reproduced correctly in the sequence.
It seems that in 20-30% of the sequences the primers
have 1 to 2 incorrect nucleotides. There is no overlap or
visible contamination, a nicely readable sequence. I use
a proof reading polymerase (Hiﬁdelity, Qiagen) and the
Topo TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing. So, my questions
are: Did anyone ever encounter this problem? How can
this happen?” And I should add the question: How can
I trust the sequence between the primers, when I see I
cannot trust the primer sequences?
I categorized the answers to 3 main points:
1. primer synthesis: The primers I used were only “de-
salted”, not puriﬁed by HPLC or PAGE. Primers are
produced by a chemical reaction in which the bases are
coupled stepwise with each other. As with every re-64 EvolDir February 1, 2007
action, you never get a 100% yield of the product you
want to get. That means even if coupling works with
an eﬃcieny of 99 % in every step, only 82 % of your
ﬁnal product will have the correct sequence (assuming
a primer lenght of 20 bp). Puritiy could be improved
by ordering HPLC or PAGE- puriﬁed primers.
2. polymerase error rate/ bacteria error rate: Every
enzyme has an error rate and the misincorporated nu-
cleotides in the primer sequences could be due to that.
For my problem, there were far to many “misincorpo-
rations” to be only explained by this, but still I this it
is an important point.
3. others
Here are the comments:
1. Primer synthesis:
- “I would guess the errors are coming from the primer
synthesis, rather than from the PCR or cloning re-
actions. During primer synthesis, the reaction that
adds each new base is not 100% eﬃcient, so many of
the resulting primers do not contain what you think
they contain. I believe this usually results in a dele-
tion, not a wrong base, so I am not sure if it re-
ally answers your question. Anyway, here is a link
to a brief note on the lack of incorporation of nu-
cleotides during synthesis: http://www.idtdna.com/-
InstantKB/article.aspx?id199 ”
- “We had the same problems, but within the whole
PCR fragment cloned- there are some one-nucleotide
changes now and then that can not be explained by al-
leles or duplicated regions-there is more ”haploytpes“
than just two or four. it is true that we used an ordi-
nary Taq and that this could be the cause, but nobody
reported that problem, although I doubt that they all
used proofreading Taq for PCR. For your problem it
might be that your primers are not synthesized prop-erly and that they contain a mixture of more primers
diﬀering only in one nucleotide?”
- “If only the primer sequences show this sequence de-
viation, you observe a quite common phenomenon, I
guess. Primers are produced by a chemical reaction in
which the bases are coupled stepwise with each other.
As with every reaction, you never get a 100% yield of
the product you want to get. If, for example, coupling
works with an eﬃcieny of 99 % in every step, only 82
% of your ﬁnal product will have the correct sequence
(assuming a primer lenght of 20 bp; 0,99 ^20 = 0,818).
You could improve primer ”purity“ by ordering HPLC
or PAGE-puriﬁed primers. However, in most cases such
highly pure primers are not needed. I would suggest you
just to contact the company were you got your primers
from and ask about how many % of primers would have
the correct sequence at a given primer length.”
- “ What you noticed can be also an eﬀect of the primer
synthesis and puriﬁcation. for example I normally use
desalting puriﬁcation, which is the standard method
that primer-synthesis companies use. That method
gives you about 90% of purity or something like that,
which means 10% or so of the primers in the mix will
not have the exact sequence. Normally the other 90%
of them swamp the ’unpure’ ones and you get the exact
sequence, but after cloning it could be diﬀerent because
if one strand was copied with the wrong primer, it will
stay like that until the end of the cycle. And since the
vector only gets one copy at a time it will keep the
bad copy and you will still notice it in the sequence.
Apparently that is more evident when your primers

Belgium EvolMosquitos
Post-doc Position : Mosquito vectors of disease: spatial
biodiversity, drivers of change, and risk.
Ongoing eco-climatic changes create suitable conditions
for the (re)emergence of vector-borne diseases in Eu-
rope. Of these, mosquito-borne diseases are prime can-
didates (e.g. recent West Nile Fever events, records of
introduction/spread of exotic Aedes albopictus in Eu-
rope, outbreaks of Chikungunya and Dengue in Europe
overseas territories). Knowledge of the taxonomic and
functional biodiversity of both endemic and invading
vector mosquito species, as well as the factors driving
change, is missing in Belgium. Acquiring this knowl-
edge is an essential step towards understanding current
risk and preparing for future threats. Therefore the
objectives of the project are (1) to make an inventory
of endemic and invading mosquito species in Belgium
considering environmental and taxonomic elements of
biodiversity, (2) to assess the population dynamics of
endemic and invasive mosquito species and their inter-
relationship (3) to model mosquito biodiversity distri-66 EvolDir February 1, 2007

FishMolecularGenetics
Postdoc in ﬁsh molecular genetics
A postdoc position is currently available in the popula-
tion genetics group of the Danish Institute for Fisheries
Research (which has recently become a part of the Dan-
ish Technical University). The postdoc will be involved
in two projects: 1) molecular analysis of eel eggs and
larvae that will be collected during an expedition to the
Sargasso Sea in early spring 2007 (the major part of
the position) and 2) identiﬁcation and development of
SNPs in brown trout (a minor part of the position, and
part of an ongoing project on analysing spatio-temporal
genetic structure in brown trout).
The work on eels is part of a multidisciplinary project
aimed at obtaining information on the population ge-
netic structure and spawning biology of European
and American eel (the project is a part of the Dan-
ish Galathea 3 expedition, www.galathea3.dk ). Both
species spawn in the Sargasso Sea, but major aspects
of their biology are virtually unknown. The work of the
postdoc will focus on the issue of panmixia vs. popula-tion subdivision in both eel species, and hybridisation
between the two species. This subproject will be based
on development and analysis of SNPs (and possibly mi-
crosatellites) in eel larvae sampled in the Sargasso Sea.
Moreover, molecular species identiﬁcation of eel larvae
and possible eel eggs will be conducted. Furthermore,
the candidate will contribute to the statistical analy-
sis of data and writing of scientiﬁc papers in collab-
oration with other project participants. The project
involves close collaboration with two other groups in
evolutionary genetics and genomics, i.e. Prof. Louis
Bernatchez’ group (Universit´ e Laval, Quebec, Canada)
and Dr. Greg Maes (Prof. Filip Volckaert’s group at the
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Laboratory of Aquatic
Ecology, Belgium).
The work place is at the Danish Institute for Fisheries
Research, Department of Inland Fisheries, in Silkeborg,
Denmark ( www.dfu.min.dk/ﬃ ). The department has
a staﬀ of approximately 25. The population genetics
group currently consists of one profesor, two senior sci-
entists, one postdoc, three technicians and ﬁve Ph.D.
and M.Sc. students.
The candidate should have good hands-on skills in
molecular biology, including DNA sequencing, primer
design and development of new markers. Knowledge
and experience in bioinformatics will also be an impor-
tant qualiﬁcation. A good background in evolution-
ary biology and population genetics is also important,
though we put strongest emphasis on the qualiﬁcations
in molecular biology.
The position is available for 14 months, and starting
date is 1 May 2007. The salary depends on qualiﬁca-
tions, but will be in the range of 36,000 DKK (6300
USD or 4800 EURO) to 39,000 DKK (approx. 6,800
USD or 5200 EURO) per month. This sum includes
pension (approx. 15%). Danish tax is approximately
45% (which also covers health insurance, school for chil-
dren and many other social beneﬁts).
Applications, including CV and publication list, along
with names and contact details of three persons
who can supply letters of recommendations should
be sent electronically to Prof. Michael M. Hansen

*Postdoc in molecular biology and population genetics
of tropical forest trees*
A postdoc position to work on the isolation and charac-
terisation of mechano-perception genes in tropical for-
est trees is available, starting February 2007, at INRA
(National Institute for Agricultural Research), France.
The programmeˆ as activities will take place at the PIAF
Research Unit in Clermont-Ferrand and at the EcoFoG
Research Unit in Kourou, French Guiana. The grant is
part of a collaborative project, WOODIVERSITY, the
goal of which is to ecologically, mechanically and genet-
ically characterise the diversity of responses of tropical
woody species to mechanical stimuli, in particular their
ability to adjust their support structures according to
local light supply and stem density. The appointee
will be in charge of isolating homologs of poplar stress-
and mechano-responsive genes in tropical tree species
by heterologous/degenerated PCR; cloning and char-
acterising the gene fragments thus obtained; producing
sequence-speciﬁc genetic markers; and analysing diver-
sity in natural populations at the selected genes. The
comparison of the amounts and distribution of diversity
at diﬀerent taxonomical levels (individual, population,
species, genus, family), and on taxa with contrasting
growth habits, will be used to infer selection levels and
evolutionary pathways at these genes.
The candidates must have a sound background inmolecular biology and in sequencing and/or genotyp-
ing, and experience in population genetics and basic
statistics. Fluency in written and spoken English is
necessary, while good written and spoken French con-
stitutes an asset. Secondary requirements are a back-
ground in bioinformatics, plant physiology, gene expres-
sion analysis, evolutionary biology.
Duration of the contract: 20 months (ﬁrst half to be
spent in Clermont-Ferrand, second half to be spent in

Postdoc in plant biogeography
A highly motivated candidate is sought to undertake
a 2.5 year postdoctoral research position in plant bio-
geography.
The role of long distance dispersal in the evolution of
the Australasian and southwest Paciﬁc ﬂora is hotly
contended, but appropriate tests of alternative hy-
potheses are still lacking. This position will develop
a new comparative method for biogeography, combin-
ing phylogeny, fossils, mutation rate estimation, and
statistical analysis tools. This approach will be applied
to the Podocarpaceae, southern pines, to test centralpremises of biogeographic theory, examine diﬀerences
in long distance dispersal dynamics and evolutionary
potential between groups, and coincidence with major
past geological or climatic changes.
Speciﬁcally the postdoc will be expected to :
1. Integrate existing phylogenetic data on
Podocarpaceae and undertake new sampling, phy-
logenetic and phylogeographic analysis for speciﬁc
groups. 2. Integrate existing macro and fossil pollen
data for Podocarpaceae 3. Examine the utility of pre-
served macrofossil sequences for developing mutation
rate analyses using ancient DNA 4. Develop statistical
methods for long distance dispersal and divergence
time estimations to test the inﬂuence of geogological
and climatic changes in the Australasian and SW

POSTDOC IN POPULATION GENETICS, UNIVER-
SITY OF ARIZONA
A postdoctoral position in population genetics is avail-
able in Michael Hammer’s group at the University of
Arizona.
Research projects are ﬂexible and can be tailored to suit
individual interests. However, they must contribute to
the group’s overall focus. Current studies include in-
ferring human demographic history from genomic data
(primarily DNA re-sequencing datasets), and distin-
guishing the roles of natural selection and demographic76 EvolDir February 1, 2007
processes in shaping patterns of genomic variability.
Our research group already hosts geneticists, computa-
tional biologists, applied mathematicians and anthro-
pologists under this broad research agenda, and pro-
vides a working interdisciplinary research environment.
A major resource of the lab is a large, novel DNA
re-sequencing database that represents 90 independent
regions of the genome. Each ’neutral’ genomic re-
gion, spanning approximately 20kb, maps to regions of
moderate to high recombination far from coding DNA.
Sampling is consistent across each genomic region and
includes data from several indigenous populations in
Africa, Eurasia and the Americas. Additional projects
focus on sequencing candidate genes for complex traits
such as resistance to disease and skin pigmentation on
the same sample panel as the ’neutral’ genomic regions.
This study design creates an essentially unique genomic
dataset.
Our group enjoys close ties with the laboratory of Jef-
frey Wall at USC as well as other labs at the University
of Arizona, notably those of Michael Nachman (EEB),
Joseph Watkins (Math) and Stephen Lansing (Anthro-
pology). Moreover, it beneﬁts from an excellent ex-
tended community of researchers in population genet-
ics, computer science, statistics and genomics at the
University of Arizona.
Applicants for the position must have: a PhD in rel-
evant ﬁeld; a graduation date no later than 30 April
2007; training in evolutionary biology and/or popula-
tion genetics; a background in either theoretical popu-
lation genetics or a quantitative ﬁeld such as statistics
with a strong interest in genetics; and advanced com-
putational skills, including at least one programming
language.
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in
theoretical population genetics or in relevant areas of
mathematics and statistics, skills in computer model-
ing by simulation or exact mathematical analysis, and
be self-motivated and independent.
This position includes outstanding UA beneﬁts includ-
ing health, dental, and life insurance; paid vacation,
sick leave, and holidays; UA/ASU/NAU tuition reduc-
tion for the employee and qualiﬁed family members;
access to UA recreation and cultural activities; state
retirement; and more.

Post-doc: Genetic variation in the susceptibility of
Drosophila to viruses
Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edin-
burgh
A Wellcome Trust funded three-year postdoctoral po-
sition is available work on genetic variation in the sus-
ceptibility of Drosophila melanogaster to viral infection.
Viruses are common pathogens in natural populations
of Drosophila. Despite the advantages of resistance,
ﬂies vary considerably in their susceptibility to viral in-
fection. Much of this variation is caused by major eﬀect
polymorphisms. Our lab is interested in which genes are
causing this variation and why they are maintained in
the population. This project will contribute to an on-
going project using techniques including QTL mapping
and association mapping to identify these genes. Once
the genes have been identiﬁed, we will investigate why
these polymorphisms are maintained. For example, are
there costs associated with the resistance alleles, or are
those resistance genes highly speciﬁc in the viral geno-
types they target.

UJyskyl GeneticVariability
An Academy of Finland funded post-doctorate position
is available at the University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Finland to
work on the maintenance of genetic variability in an-
imals with asexual reproduction in collaboration with80 EvolDir February 1, 2007
Johanna Mappes, Jukka Jokela and Alessandro Grap-
puto.
The main theme of the project is targeted at investi-
gating how parthenogenetic animals can maintain high
genetic variability and compete with sexual relatives.
All theories on the evolution and maintenance of sex
have been based on the comparison between sexual and
clonal parthenogenetic reproduction. However, asex-
ual reproduction is not always clonal, but can involve
meiosis and recombination as in automictic thelytoky,
a form of parthenogenesis occurring in many insects.
Automictic parthenogenetic species should have the ad-
vantage of avoiding the cost of sex and, at the same
time, enjoy the advantages of genetic diversity through
recombination and decrease the mutational load, mak-
ing sex even more paradoxical. Recently, it has also
been theoretically shown that the viability of popula-
tions with automictic parthenogenesis and central fu-
sion increases with increasing rates of recombination.
We are investigating the population structure of sexual
and parthenogenetic lineages, the genetic erosion within
single parthenogenetic lineages and if parthenogenetic
lineages have higher rate of recombination than sexual
lineages. The position will involve molecular laboratory
work with bag worm moths (Lepidoptera: Psychidae)
which provide one of the rare known systems where
sexual and asexual species co-exist. The psychid moth
could oﬀer important insights for the evolution of sex
theory since their particular mode of asexual reproduc-
tion (the automictic thelytoky).
Applicants should have a PhD degree in a rel-
evant biological discipline, and a strong interest
in evolutionary biology. Previous experience with
molecular ecology and/or molecular biology meth-
ods is preferred. You will join the Centre of
Excellence in Evolutionary Research at University
of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a ( http://www.jyu.ﬁ/science/laitokset/-
bioenv/evoluutiotutkimus/en/ ). Part of research could
be carried out also at the ETH in Zurich with Jukka
Jokela and at the Dept. of Biology of the University of
Padova, Italy with Alessandro Grapputo.
Salary, according to qualiﬁcations, will be based on the
new Finnish governmental salary system. Initial ap-
pointment for a qualiﬁed postdoctoral candidate can
be made for one year with possible extensions.

Project 1: The cellular mechanisms of parasite-induced
feminisation in arthropod hosts.
A NERC-BBSRC-funded postdoctoral post is available
immediately, for up to three years, to investigate the
cellular mechanisms of parasite-induced feminisation
of arthropod hosts. Parasitic sex ratio distorters are
widespread in invertebrate hosts. Vertically transmit-
ted parasites are uniparentally inherited and selection
to enhance the relative frequency of the transmitting
sex has led to the evolution of a number of strategies of
sex ratio distortion. Feminisation is induced by the bac-
terium Wolbachia in the Crustacea including Armadil-
lidium vulgare and by microsporidia (eukaryote para-
sites) in the Crustacea including Gammarus duebeni.
Whilst Wolbachia induces feminisation in Crustacea,
in insects including Drosophila bifasciata it may causemale killing. We propose that these intracellular para-
sites are most likely to act by secreting molecules into
the host cell which will then inﬂuence host molecular
pathways, they may modify the response to external
hormonal signals or even induce programmed cell death
(apoptosis). Such changes could disrupt patterns of
sexual development or lead to sex-speciﬁc embryo mor-
tality.
This post is concerned with the cellular basis of Wol-
bachia and microsporidia induced feminisation. You
will map parasite distribution during host sexual diﬀer-
entiation using in situ hybridisation and map patterns
of apoptosis during development using TUNEL mark-
ers and investigate the impact of parasitism on host
signalling through investigation of phosphorylation of
host proteins.
A PhD in a relevant subject area and a strong research
background in one of the following areas; cell or de-
velopmental biology, molecular parasitology, or mecha-
nisms of sex ratio distortion are essential as is the ability
to work independently. You must also be able to use
software for image analysis, word processing, spread-
sheet and data analysis, give presentations and exhibit
eﬀective practical skills at the laboratory bench.

2 YEAR POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
ON DIVERSIFICATION OF PLANT LINEAGES
WITHIN HABITATS
->WHERE? University of Rennes 1, France; Institute
Ecosystems, Biodiversity, Evolution; Group Ecology of
Diversiﬁcation (Andreas Prinzing)
->WHEN? Commencing early spring 2007 at the lat-
est. The initial contract is for one year, renewable,
without problems, for another year. (Review of appli-
cations starting IMMEDIATELY, application deadline
is JANUARY 28, please send statement of interest as
soon as possible.)
->THE PROJECT (funded as Action Th´ ematique /lessmuch
ATIP /greatermuchby Centre National de la Recherche Scien-
tiﬁque):
The major hypothesis for the project is that habitat
types drive evolutionary diversiﬁcation of plant lin-
eages.
Many evolutionary biologists have a hierarchical view
of local species communities: Communities are assem-
bled from a regional pool of already-evolved species via
a habitat ﬁlter acting on already-evolved traits. In our
project we will explore the opposite view: whether and
how the ecological conditions within diﬀerent types of
habitats may aﬀect the pattern and pace of evolution-
ary diversiﬁcation of phylogenetic lineages across geo-
logical time scales. We particularly account for eﬀects
of habitats on genetic variation, division of gene pools,
and local persistence of genetic isolates. We are espe-
cially interested in eﬀects mediated by genomic and life
history traits of the species. This research will allow
us to explore how mechanisms of diversiﬁcation depend
on the ecological context.
The major methodological approach is the analysis of
comprehensive databases on the phylogeny, habitat use,
co-existence, genome and life history of central Euro-
pean plant species, in order to reconstruct ancestralhabitats and traits, and their inﬂuences on the pace and
pattern of evolution. We aim for collecting additional
information on the genome size of species (in collabora-
tion with an external lab), a still under-recorded trait
linked to both environment and diversiﬁcation.
The work will mainly involve evolutionary phylogenetic
analysis, for example character reconstruction, examin-
ing factors aﬀecting speciation/extinction rates in phy-
logenies, examining randomness or non-randomness of
branching patterns, phylogenetically independent com-
parative analyses.
->ELIGIBLE are holders of a PHD (at the date of
recruitment) *except French citizens* (constraint im-
posed by the funding agency)
->PREFERRED CRITERIA:
- Strong statistical and computing skills ideally in one
of the above listed phylogenetic approaches
- An interest in plant environments (biotic or abiotic),
plant life-histories or plant phylogeny and how they in-
teract
- Willingness to do some ﬁeldwork such as sampling
plant species
- Publication experience
->RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT:
The host institution is the Research Unit Ecosystems,
Biodiversity, Evolution, co-funded by University
of Rennes 1 and Centre National de la Recherche
Scientiﬁque (CNRS), harboring 58 researchers and
teachers. It was ranked A in the national evaluation
of research institutions. Several further research in-
stitutions in ecology and evolutionary biology exist at
Rennes. Our Research Group within the Research Unit
works among other things on phylogenetic community
assembly of plants and animals, on diversiﬁcation
of plant phenotypes along climatic gradients, and
the diversity of arthropods in tree canopies. See

EvolBiolCommunication Jun4-8
International Ph.D. course on ???The Evolutionary Bi-
ology of Communication???
4-8 June 2007, Copenhagen, Denmark
Communication is a key element of any social be-
haviour. Without communication, social interactions
and cooperation are impossible. Understanding com-
munication mechanisms is at the core of any attempt
to analyze social organizations.
Aim of the course
The purpose of the course is to introduce students to
the study of communication in a social context, and to
explore its evolution and constraints. The course will
combine presentations by leaders in the ﬁeld of social
communication with discussions of published studies
and practical demonstrations of how social communi-
cation can be investigated.
There will be formal and informal opportunities for mu-
tual interactions between students and teachers. Stu-
dents will be the driving force behind the course and
not simply spectators.
Corse set-up
The course is ﬁve days. The ﬁrst, second and fourth day
will include plenary lectures by the teachers, followed
by open discussion, and group-work. Students will be
given the opportunity to present their own research in
two sessions of short talks. The third day will be de-
voted to practical work in two sessions: ???Chemical
Communication in Social Insects??? and ???Acoustic
Communication in Birds???. The last day will focus on
perspectives and future avenues for research in commu-
nication.

Mixed Model Methodology (MMM) is a key procedure
for analyzing correlated data within a broad range of co-
variance structures both in linear and non linear frame-
works. We are now in a new stage involving more so-February 1, 2007 EvolDir 91
phisticated modelling approaches. These involve multi
levels of modelling (population and individual; mean
and variance models) and also the use of dynamic sys-
tems based on ordinary or stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tions especially in the ﬁeld of functional data analysis.
On the other hand, approximated inference procedures
for generalized linear and non linear mixed models have
clearly shown their limits and exact methods are now
required. Such methods and models are now feasible
via the availability of Stochastic Monte Carlo methods
such as Metropolis and Gibbs sampling. These can be
applied both within a classical framework (maximum
likelihood and EM algorithm) or within a Bayesian one.
The purpose of this course is twofold: (i) to review
these new tools in a pedagogical way and (ii) to show
how they can already be applied in many areas of bio-
statistics (e.g. functional data analysis and genomics)
using existing softwares (e.g. SAS, winbugs, R-oriented
tools). Special attention will be devoted to examples
and real data processing.
The course is mainly intended to PhD students, but is
also open to young or senior scientists. All the lectures
will be given in English.

Workshop on Molecular Evolution
http://workshop.molecularevolution.org/ Michael P.
Cummings, Director
22 July - 3 August 2007 plus extended topics session 4
August - 10 August 2007
Application Deadline 1 March 2007
The Workshop on Molecular Evolution has been the
ﬁnest course of its type in the world since it was started
in 1988. The Workshop consists of a series of lectures,
demonstrations and computer laboratories that cover
various aspects of molecular evolution. A distinguish-
ing feature of the Workshop is a well-equipped com-
puter laboratory with Linux workstations and servers
for comparative analysis of molecular data. Authors
and experts in the use of computer programs and
packages such as Clustal W and Clustal X, FASTA,
GARLI, GCG, LAMARC, MrBayes, PAML, PAUP*,
and PHYLIP provide demonstrations and consulta-
tions. This two-week program is designed for estab-
lished investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and advanced
graduate students with prior experience in molecular
evolution and comparative genomics. Scientists with a
strong interest in molecular evolution, systematics, and
population genetics are encouraged to apply. Enroll-
ment is limited to 60 students, and 15 students will be
admitted to an extended topics session for the purpose
of analyzing their research data sets. Many participants
ﬁnd the extended topics session to be especially useful.
Topics to be covered include:
* Databases and sequence matching: database search-
ing: protein sequence versus protein structure; homol-
ogy; mathematical, statistical, and theoretical aspects
of sequence database searches * Phylogenetic analysis:
theoretical, mathematical and statistical bases; sam-
pling properties of sequence data; Bayesian analysis,
hypothesis testing * Character analysis in a phylo-
genetic context: analysis of quantitative and discrete
characters; hypothesis testing * Maximum likelihood
theory and practice in phylogenetics and population ge-
netics: coalescent theory; maximum likelihood estima-
tion of population genetic parameters * Bayesian meth-
ods in phylogenetic analysis * Molecular evolution inte-
grated at diﬀerent levels: population biology; biogeog-
raphy; ecology; systematics and conservation * Molec-92 EvolDir February 1, 2007
ular evolution and development: gene duplication and
divergence; gene family organization; coordinated ex-
pression in evolution * Comparative genomics: genome
content; genome structure; genome evolution * Trans-
posable elements: types; history; evolutionary dynam-
ics; as a major component of genomes
Fee: $2150 (room and board at no additional charge),
plus an additional $850 for the extended topics session.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.February 1, 2007 EvolDir 93
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
