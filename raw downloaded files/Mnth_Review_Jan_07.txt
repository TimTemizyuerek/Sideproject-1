CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: Conference DNA SAM-
PLING STRATEGIES AND DESIGN“ - Paris

Heyer and Franz Manni Scientiﬁc committee: Fr´ ed´ eric
Austerlitz, Evelyne Heyer, Raphael Leblois, Franz
Manni, Lluis Quintana-Murci
The aim of this methodological conference is to discuss
the issue of the sampling in human population genetics
studies (selection of DNA donors, deﬁnition of popula-
tions and choice of markers). If the sampling is the base
of any study, it is seldom addressed–in itself– as a re-
search question, and scholars seem to design their sam-
pling strategies according to a personal cookbook that
may have its merits but may also suﬀer from hidden
limitations. If the sampling strategy is closely related
to the research question and to the type of markers
used, we think that a broad and wide discussion on the
sampling itself will help us to establish more consensual
procedures that, hopefully, will lead to more trustwor-
thy results.

/www.cnrs.fr/sdv/cjm/cjmveuille.html Evolutionary
genomics is concerned with the selective forces acting
on the evolution of genome function in populations, and
the complementarity of informations provided by cod-
ing and non-coding parts of the genome. Three major
events have deeply modiﬁed this research ﬁeld at the
start of the 21st century. Firstly, studies in evolution-
ary genomics have shown that a larger part of coding re-
gions than hitherto suspected is subject to strong selec-
tive constraints, suggesting that so-called junk-DNA is
less important than was previously thought. Secondly,
genomics programs are generating massive amounts of
data. In addition to comparative species data, an un-
precedented amount of polymorphic data is now being
created. Finally, it has become apparent that genomes
contain much smaller numbers of genes than was for-
merly expected, even though living organisms synthe-
size large numbers of proteins, expressed at several dif-
ferent levels of expression.
The program of the conference aims to present the cur-
rent state of a research ﬁeld that has emerged over the
last ten years. It does not intend to show ﬁnal results,
but rather to identify new research directions and ﬁelds
of synergy. The conference is therefore structured into
questions corresponding to conceptual issues, in a ﬁeld
whose study relies on a very broad theoretical frame-
work in mathematics and bioinformatics.

This is a second reminder that the semi-annual Gordon
Conference on Quantitative Genetics and Genomics will
take place February 18-23, 2007 at the Ventura Beach
Marriott, Ventura, California. Conference participants
consistently rank this as the best meeting that they at-
tend. We emphasize crossdisciplinary communication,
cutting edge work, and a lot of fun (including the tradi-
tional wine-country tour). The 2005 meeting sold out,
so count on registering early.
The full schedule is now available at (an overview
is given below): http://www.grc.org/programs/2007/-
quantgen.htm Quantitative genetics aims to link phe-
notypic variation to its underlying genetic basis in order
to better understand and predict genetic composition
and long term change within natural, agricultural, and
human populations. Traditionally built upon statistical
abstractions of genetic eﬀects, the ﬁeld is now rapidly
advancing by making use of recent developments in ge-
netic technology to reveal explicit links between genes
and complex phenotypes, and therefore serves as a fo-
cal point bringing together many emerging areas of ge-
netics, genomics, statistics, and biotechnology. This
synthesis is already having a large impact on the ar-
eas of evolutionary biology, plant and animal breeding,
and the analysis of human disease. The strength of the
Gordon Conference on ˆ aQuantitative Genetics and Ge-
nomicsˆ a has historically been the bringing together of
leaders in each of these ﬁelds to explore areas of shared
interest and cutting edge developments with the poten-
tial to aﬀect all researchers within the broad ﬁeld of
quantitative genetics.
Building upon the tremendous success of our confer-
ences in recent years, we will again focus on cutting
edge developments in the ﬁeld, especially highlighting
whole genomic approaches to marker analysis, associa-
tion mapping, transcriptional proﬁling, and statistical
analysis. As the ﬁeld turns its attention from loosely
mapped chromosomal regions to speciﬁc genetic ele-
ments, elucidation of gene function in a quantitative
genetic context becomes central, and these approaches
will also be highlighted here. Finally, comprehensive
solutions to understanding genetic basis of complex
variation require large-scale collaborations among re-
searchers, and several exemplars of these eﬀorts will be6 EvolDir January 1, 2007
presented.
We look forward to meeting you in Ventura, CA in
February of 2007! Your continued participation and
support of this conference is greatly appreciated. As
you will see from the schedule, afternoons are free for
adventure and discussion, while poster sessions will be
held in the evening.
See you in Ventura! Patrick Phillips and Daniel Pomp

CarletonU BehaviouralEvolution
Graduate assistantships are available in behavioural
evolution in the laboratory of Dr. Sue Bertram at Car-
leton University in Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA. These
positions will begin September, 2007 (but could possi-
bly be extended to a start date of December 2008).
I am looking for exceptional graduate students who are
broadly interested in studying insect mating behaviour
and evolution. The positions will be part of a larger
project aimed at understanding how variation is main-
tained in traits that confer ﬁtness. Speciﬁcally, I am
interested in students who would like to pursue a re-
search project in one of the following three areas:
1. Quantitative genetics of condition, life-history, and
sexually selected traits 2. Dietary inﬂuences on condi-
tion, life-history, and sexually selected traits 3. Social
interactions inﬂuencing condition, life-history, and sex-
ually selected traits
It is essential that students have high enough grades to
obtain a teaching assistantship through Carleton Uni-
versity (and preferably a scholarship as well). Students
who come with their own funding are certainly most
welcome - but this is not mandatory. Summer salary
will be provided. The positions may require travel into
the United States for ﬁeld-work. Assistantships can be
at the Masters or the PhD level, depending on the in-
terests, abilities, and experience of the applicants. It
is also often possible to transfer from the Masters pro-
gram into the PhD program at a later date.
Interested persons should examine my web site
at: ( http://http- server.carleton.ca/ ~sbertram/).
They should then contact me via email at Su-
sanBertram@carleton.ca to discuss their interests
further. When you contact me, please provide a
statement of interest, curriculum vitae, transcripts,
and contact information for faculty willing to write
letters of reference. For acceptance into the Masters
or PhD program for September 2007, students should
apply to the graduate program soon, and certainly
by January 2007. Please don’t apply to the graduate
program without ﬁrst contacting me! Looking forward
to hearing from you.Sincerely,

cell/molecular biology of mitochondria and hydrogeno-
somes in anaerobic protists
Laboratory of Andrew J. Roger, Department of Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University
Halifax, Nova Scotia CANADA
We seek a highly skilled and self-motivated student
to explore the evolution of metabolic and functional
properties of mitochondrion-derived organelles (e.g. hy-
drogenosomes and mitosomes) in diverse free-living and
parasitic anaerobic protists. Speciﬁcally, the research
will concern the subcellular localization of putative or-
ganellar proteins, puriﬁcation and proteomic analysis
of these organelles, as well as elucidation of organelle
function from EST surveys of anaerobic protists. The
organisms we are studying include poorly studied uni-
cellular eukaryote lineages and will provide key insights
into the early evolutionary history of mitochondria in
the eukaryote lineage.
The Roger Lab is part of a collegial and internation-
ally recognized community of comparative genomics
and molecular evolution researchers at Dalhousie Uni-
versity. The successful applicant will have the oppor-
tunity to work collaboratively with these researchers
and with those at other institutions. Demonstrated
skills in cell and molecular biology (e.g. immunoﬂuores-
cence, immuno-EM, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
& subcellular fractionation), bioinformatics, compara-
tive genomics, genome evolution and phylogenetics are
important, as are strong written and oral communica-
tion abilities.
Students applying must comply with the minimum re-
quirements of the Department of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology graduate program: (see http://-
www.biochem.dal.ca/graduate/index.php for more in-
formation). All qualiﬁed and interested persons are en-

EdinburghU InﬂuenzaEvolGenomics
PhD studentship: Evolutionary genomics of inﬂuenza
A virus
Funding is available to students from EUROPE/UK
ONLY
Application Deadline: 01 February 2007
Inﬂuenza is one of the most common, and serious, res-
piratory infections of humans. However, it is only with
the recent explosion in computational power that we
have been able to employ the numerical techniques re-
quired to analyse the 1000s of complete viral genomes
currently being produced year. The genome of inﬂuenza
A virus (IVA) comprises a negative-sense molecule ar-
ranged as eight segments which encode 11 proteins.
Not only do these genomic segments evolve extremely
rapidly through the accumulation of mutations, the
viruses can also recombine the segments to create new
variants (a process called reassortment). This project
would involve developing and applying state-of-the-art
computational techniques (Drummond et al, 2006) to
analyse genomic sequences of IVA sampled globally over
time. The aim is to investigate the rate of molecular
evolution, the degree of selection acting on the genomic
segments, the interactions between the segments and
the rate of genetic exchange. Notably, although com-
parative studies have revealed that reassortment is a
relatively frequent process within the subtype H3N2, it
is unknown whether speciﬁc segments, or combinations10 EvolDir January 1, 2007
of segments, exhibit higher or lower rates of reassort-
ment than others. Thus the importance of reassort-
ment as an evolutionary force will be assessed relative
to the process of mutation. This project will also look at
the seasonal dynamics of the diﬀerent subtypes of IVA
and how they interact with each other through cross-
protective immunity. Ultimately this project aims to
improve our understanding of the dynamics of inﬂuenza
virus evolution and to help us answer some important
questions about future epidemics. For example, can
we predict whether the current highly- virulent form of
avian inﬂuenza (H5N1) will emerge as a new disease
of humans? How will it interact with existing human
forms of the disease?
This project will entirely consist of computational anal-
ysis. It would be suitable for a graduate in computer
science or physical sciences with a strong interest in
evolutionary biology of infectious diseases or a biology
graduate with excellent computer and numerical skills.

Two PhD positions in Behavioural and Evolutionary
Genetics
We are looking for PhD candidates to work on two
projects about the genetic basis of ﬁtness trait varia-
tion in a wild bird population.
The ﬁrst project is about the genetic architecture of
heterozygosity ﬁtness correlations. Current hypotheses
on locus-speciﬁc balancing selection, inbreeding avoid-
ance, mate choice and variable environments will be
tested, using data from a 7-year ﬁeld study on blue
tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. This project mainly involves
genotyping in the lab and evolutionary / population
genetic analyses.
The aim of the second project is to investigate genotype
phenotype associations between clock genes and circa-
dian behaviour in blue tits. Circadian activity traits un-
der diﬀerent natural conditions and under standardized
experimental conditions will be measured and tested for
genetic associations. This project combines intensive
ﬁeldwork with molecular genetic lab work.
We are seeking two highly motivated candidates inter-
ested in behavioural ecology in combination with evo-
lutionary or population genetics (ﬁrst position) or or-
nithology and genome analysis (second position).
The successful candidate will join an international re-
search group at the Max Planck Institute for Or-
nithology with up-to-date molecular lab facilities and
long-standing experience in avian behavioural ecology.
Working language is English. Salary will be according
to Tv¨ oD 13/2 (formerly BAT IIa/2).
The Max Planck Society is a equal opportunity em-
ployer. Disabled persons with comparable qualiﬁca-
tions receive preferential status.
To apply, please send a cover letter describing your

NSF IGERT Opportunities at the University of Hawaii
(UH): Integrating Ecology, Conservation, and Pathogen
Biology (ECPB)
We are seeking exceptional doctoral students interested
in intergrative research and training in evolutionary
ecology and biomedical sciences. The program’s over-
arching theme, disease ecology, addresses the need to
improve the understanding of emerging infectious dis-
eases, how they originate and spread, their impact on
humans, domesticated animals, and on natural ecosys-
tems and biodiversity. Research themes integrate, for
example, the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of
host-pathogen relationships from phylogenetics to phy-
lodynamics, the molecular and cellular processes in-
volved in pathogenesis, and conservation biology in-
cluding the role of anthropogenic environmental change
on emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases and in-
vasive species. The ECPB has an interdisciplinary
curriculum that includes applied evolutionary ecology,
conservation biology, medical geography, and tropical
medicine, taking advantage of Hawaii’s tropical forest
and coral ecosystems as outdoor classroom and labora-
tory and collaborations with UH’s East-West Center.
ECPB’s mission is to facilitate the training of a new
cadre of scientists particularly skilled in working across
disciplines to meet the increasing challenges of emerg-
ing infectious diseases and wide-spread species invasions
in an age of rampant globalization and environmental
degradation.
ECPB Fellows will be selected from qualiﬁed Ph.D.
students who have been accepted into participating
doctoral programs at UH consistent with the goals of
ECPB, with at least two faculty mentors whose disci-
plinary expertise bridge ecology (including evolutionary
ecology), conservation, and/or pathogen biology. The
fellowship includes a stipend ($30,000/yr) and tuition
for two years. U.S. citizenship or permanent residency
is required. Selection will be based on student qual-
iﬁcations, relevance of research interests, and balance
among participating programs and faculty. We espe-
cially encourage applications from members of under-
represented minority groups.
Applications for Fall 2007 should be preceded by a short
letter (1 page or less) describing which of the ECPB re-
search themes ( http://jabsom.hawaii.edu/igert/ ) pro-vide the best ﬁt for your research interests, along with

UNevadaReno Computational
I (Guy Hoelzer) am looking to recruit a PhD student
to begin in the Fall, 2007, who would work with me on
developing and analyzing spatially explicit models of
ecology and evolution. I am particularly interested in
exploring the general ways in which isolation by dis-
tance can inﬂuence evolutionary dynamics and lead
to endogenous mechanisms of spatial pattern forma-
tion, including speciation. My colleagues and I have
a good start on developing this program, which is al-
ready yielding very interesting results, and I hope to
expand the scope of the model to include ecological
interactions and more realistically heterogeneous land-
scapes. I think this computational framework will facil-
itate asking a great number of interesting questions, so
the student ﬁlling this role will be encouraged to fully
participate in decisions regarding the direction his/her
speciﬁc dissertation will take. I prefer to think of my
role as the guiding of a collaboration, rather than as
an employer who imposes a research project on my stu-
dents. The nature of this research will require familiar-
ity with object oriented programming languages (e.g.,
Java, MatLab, C++) and skill in code writing.
The student will initially be funded with a teaching as-
sistantship and will contribute to the writing of a grant
proposal aimed at funding the computational infras-
tructure to support model analyses and a research as-
sistantship, which will allow the student to devote more
time to the project.
Prospective students should provide me with informa-
tion on their academic credentials and a description of
their experience in writing computer programs by con-
tacting me at <hoelzer@unr.edu >. They should also
explore what our graduate program in Ecology, Evolu-
tion, and Conservation Biology (EECB) at the Univer-
sity of Nevada Reno has to oﬀer by going to the pro-
gram’s website at <http://www.eecb.unr.edu/ >. This

an application.

thetases and related genes (polyketide synthetases) in
organisms such as cyanobacteria, fungi and protists.
Another major approach will be modelling of peptide
synthetases in order to relate structural properties to
amino acid changes in diﬀerent synthetases, and to put
such results into a functional and evolutionary frame-
work. The goal of the project is to contribute to our un-
derstanding of the biological function(s) and evolution
of non-ribosomal peptides in particular and secondary
metabolites in general.

Research assistant positions in Europe: plant ecological
genomics
We are looking for ﬁeld assistants to participate in a
large-scale investigation of the evolution of ﬂowering
time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our approach includes
analysis of ﬂowering time response to a wide range of
natural and manipulated environments at levels rang-
ing from DNA sequence variation to continental ecotype
distributions. This NSF-funded Frontiers in Biological
Research (FIBR) project – headed by Johanna Schmitt
at Brown University – is a collaborative eﬀort of four
labs in the US as well as Arabidopsis laboratories at
ﬁve research institutions in Europe. Part of this study
entails establishing a set of ﬁve common gardens in Eu-
rope in Valencia, Spain; Oulu, Finland; Norwich, UK;
Cologne, Germany; and Halle, Germany. At these sites
large numbers of European A. thaliana accessions, mu-
tants, and near isogenic lines are being grown in mul-
tiple plantings synchronized with local populations in
order to assess geographic and seasonal variation in se-
lection on ﬂowering time and other life history traits.
We are seeking research assistants who would be inter-
ested in living at one of the ﬁve European ﬁeld sites
and traveling between sites to assist with plant care
and measurement. Prior independent research experi-
ence (particularly with plants) is necessary, as research
assistants may be largely independent for prolonged pe-
riods of time. We anticipate 3 types of positions:
1) Two or three “postbac” research fellowships. These
positions provide the opportunity to design and con-
duct an independent research project with the host lab-
oratories based on the shared interests of the applicant
and the host lab. This research assistantship involves
a strong training component and was conceived as be-
ing analogous to Fulbright fellowships. These positions
are available starting in May 2007 for 12 months, with
some possibility of extension. Applicants should have
a bachelors degree in biology or a related science. This
is an excellent opportunity for graduating seniors inter-
ested in a research career to obtain further experiencebefore applying to graduate school.
2) A 6 month research assistant position starting in
March or early April 2007, with the possibility of ex-
tension for at least a year as a “postbac” research fel-
lowship. This position will mostly be based in Finland
through the summer. Applicants should have a bache-
lors degree in biology or a related science.
3) We may also have one or more summer research
assistant positions for May-August 2007. Applicants
for these positions should be recent baccalaureates or
advanced undergraduates with research experience in
plant biology, evolution, or ecology.

a theoretical basis for understanding how population
structure be it genetic, physiological, social, spatial
or trophic inﬂuences the persistence and extinction of
populations and communities, and (2) to test the hy-
potheses emerging from these models in biotic systems
amenable to experimental manipulation.
Tasks The appointee will be expected to develop an in-
dependent research programme on the interactions be-tween plants, herbivores and their natural enemies, and
to obtain additional funding. Potential research topics

arms races, maintenance of polymorphisms, frequency-
dependent selection, and feedback mechanisms between
natural selection and population dynamics. The ap-
pointee will be expected to use modern tools developed
in molecular biology and genetics for testing popula-
tion biological hypotheses; a thorough background in
population and molecular biology is therefore required.
Furthermore, the appointee will be expected to interact
with plant physiologists, ecologists, evolutionary biolo-
gists and mathematical biologists. In addition to con-
tributing to the existing educational programme of the
Bachelors and Masters curriculum in biology, he or she
will play an important role in initiating new courses
and in the supervision of PhD projects. Finally, the
appointee will be expected to contribute to the man-
agement processes in our institute and faculty.
Requirements We welcome applications from re-

AFLP scoring using GeneMarker
Dear All,
Is anyone else out there using SoftGenetic’s Gene-
Marker to score AFLPs? I am trying to organize and
read data from an ABI 3730. Having never used soft-
ware to score these type of data before, I’m unclear on
how best to proceed. The data look good, but the in-
structions accompanying GeneMarker lack in rudimen-
tary instruction. How do you proceed from the data?
Do you go through your samples using a Panel Edi-
tor, then move on to the Trace Comparison feature?
Right now I’m looking at data from my “screening”
population set (ostensibly maximizing genetic variabil-
ity), with three DNA extractions from each isolate in
the set, and see very reassuring uniformity within each
triplicate set. I’m hoping to establish a set of loci to use
for further population and progeny set studies. While
it’s not clear in the GeneMarker manual, I’m hoping
there’s a way to use the software to ﬁlter future data to
focus on only those loci identiﬁed in the screening pop-
ulation. I’m waiting to hear back from the SoftGenetics
people, hoping they can give me some advice, but in the
meantime thought I’d contact folks here. Thanks, Bob.

Barnacle DNA extraction answers
Thank you all for your answers to our question about
DNA extraction of barnacles.
Several methods were mentioned that could be tried.
The Qiagen Dneasy tissue kit (often a very option)
didn’t work in our case, we had tried that already.Purgen kits (Gentra) was also suggested by several,
something I want to try.
Also suggested were plant CTAB methods, which we
had used and didn’t work in our case (with the whole
animal) Using only the cirri (“feeding arms”) seemed a
good suggestion, avoiding problems with nasty enzymes
in their intestines.
So what did we do? We used only the cirri and our
CTAB method (includes chloroform extractions), which
gave a small amount but good DNA which appears to
be much more stable than using the whole animal!! So
using a part of the body, excluding intestines etc. is
much better.
Secondly we tried two kits (free samples!) from Micro-
zone Ltd. The ’DYNAMITE for diﬃcult cells’ was used
with a whole animal and gave loads of DNA that also
appears stable. Further we used cirri with their MI-
CROLYSIS PLUS kit, which gave a small amount, but
seemingly stable DNA. The MICROLYSIS plus kit is
the quickest and easiest, but gives a limited amount of
DNA (good for PCRs), whereas Dynamite needs a few
more steps (still very quick and easy), but gives more
DNA to play with.
MICROLYSIS PLUS is not hugely expensive, some-
thing like 60 pence a sample and VERY easy and quick.
The DYNAMITE for diﬃcult cells (or DYNAMITE for
mouth swaps) is still in its trial phase, so we were grate-
ful for the free sample of Microzone. This product will
need some further testing, but is likely to be available
after Xmas. Check their website www.microzone.co.uk
(no I don’t have shares).
We are pleased to say that we have now passed the ex-
traction phase, ﬁnally, and working on constructing a
library. Thanks again for your suggestions.
Best wishes, Kirsten Wolﬀ
List of some of the responses:
do barnacles have a hepatopancreas? This organ is
famed for causing problem in snails due to the num-
ber of enzymes in it (mostly anecdotal, admittedly). If
so, then dissect out or use foot alone? In any case, if itJanuary 1, 2007 EvolDir 41
is still degrading then it must be due to some kind of
DNAse carry over.
Cheerio, Angus
We have had terriﬁc success in extracting cirri of Bal-
anus glandula with a 10% chelex solution (see Sotka,
E.E., J.P. Wares, R.K. Grosberg and S.R. Palumbi.
(2004) Strong genetic clines and geographic variation
in gene ﬂow in the rocky intertidal barnacle Balanus
glandula. Molecular Ecology 13:2143-2156), as well as
a Nucleospin kit. Yes, I dissect two or three pairs of
cirri and place into 150 ul of 10% chelex. This repre-
sents about 1mm sq. worth of tissue.
Erik
Yours is a familiar tale... I have run into molluscs that
do what your barnicle is doing. Have you tried crush-
ing the tissue in liquid nitrogen and then straight into
CTAB? Can you take only muscle tissue rather than
the whole animal? The only other thing I can suggest
is something you are undoubtedly already doing, which
is to not be greedy when collecting the aqueous phase in
your extractions to minimize any contaminants. Prob-
ably none of this will help – no doubt there is an evil
humour co-purifying with the DNA!
Richard
Which column based extractions have you used? I
had similar problems when extracting DNA from
mygalomorph spiders (DNA broke down after 24
hours...sometimes less) and I found that the QIAGEN
kits worked nicely. If a CTAB protocol is working (al-
beit brieﬂy) you could try grinding the tissue sample
in liquid nitrogen (as for a standard plant extraction)
- there’s a paper that describes similar problems for
ladybird extractions and that was their solution (Schu-
lenburg et al in Mol. Biol. Evol. 18(4): 648-660. 2001).
Otherwise there’s the option of washing the sample with
bleach then dd H20. In general I also found that using
smaller starting quantities of tissue and ensuring that
I was only using internal muscle tissue helped a great
deal. All the best though... it’s a nasty problem!
Amber
I was just sent this link by someone, and thought of
you and Martha. I haven’t tried it, but yet another

I just saw your post on Evoldir concerning you DNA
extraction problems I have not idea why the columns
dont work but you could try our new DNA extractionprotocol, which combined CTAB and silica puriﬁcation.

GNU GeneMapper version
Hello
I’m doing my PhD and I will use microsatellites markers
on bread wheat. I’ve already used GeneMapper (Ap-
plied Biosystems) to analyse the data from sequencer
ABI 3130 but now I work with Linux Ubuntu. So I
look for a software that analyses microsatellites data
ﬁles from ABI sequencer but that can be installed on
Linux. I hope I’m not the only one that look for such
software.
Thank you for your help.

Human Evolution texts answers
Dear friends,
I would like to share the 8 suggestions I received from
the list !!!
But.... I am wating more!!!
There is a book by Chris Stringer and Peter Andrews
called ’The complete world of human Evolution’. This
was a good core book for the human Evolution module
I took for my degree. It has a very recent edition and
gives all the basics. For more detail its reference list
can be checked out.
I’m not an expert in human evolution, but this is a very
interesting topic and I have some documents about
it. There is a book entittled “Human Evolutionary
Genetics” that is very comprehensive, and it’s written
in a very easy-to-understand but professional manner.
The amazon link is; http://www.amazon.com/-
Human-Evolutionary-Genetics-Matthew-Hurles/dp/-
0815341857/sr=8-1/qid66616417/ref=pd bbssr1/-
002-3050681-3447265?ie=UTF8&s=books If you’re
going to teach human evolution for a long time, I
highly recommend that book (though it’s a personal
view, not professional). Moreover, there is an excellent
recent review about Primate comparative genomics
that, though not focused in human evolution, oﬀered
me a lot of interesting ideas and references. The
PubMed link is that;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/-
query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=-
Retrieve&dopt /lessmuchstractPlus&list uids485353&query hl=
1&itool=pubmed docsum I could send you the PDF
if you don’t have access to it. That’s all I can say, my
research area is not human evolution itself so perhaps
there exists a lot of good textbooks that I don’t know.44 EvolDir January 1, 2007
You may or may not be interested in this book, but I
recently saw the author speak and found his book to
be an excellent current overview of human evolution.
It is not suitable as a textbook, but I think it would
be a good source for constructing lectures from noth-
ing. “Human evolution: a very short introduction”,
Bernard Wood
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Human-Evolution-Short-
Introduction-Introductions/dp/0192803603/sr-1/-
qid66615232/ref=sr 111/203-0310298-5115968 .For a
modern text, you could try: “The Origin of Species,
Revisited” (McGill-Queens 2001) “Evolutionary
Bioinformatics” (Springer 2006)
You may ﬁnd some useful pictures in evolu-
tion web-pages ( http://post.queensu.ca/ ˜ forsdyke/-
evolutio.htm ) And, in all seriousness, for background
reading you should read Samuel Butler’s 1878 text “Life
and Habit”.
Human Evolutionary Genetics: origins, people and dis-
ease. M Jobling, M Hurles and C Tyler-Smith Garland
Science, 2004
It depends a bit on what exactly you want, but if you
are interested in human evolution with special refer-
ence to disease susceptibility en genetics, I ﬁnd “Hu-
man Evolutionary Genetics” from Jobling, Hurles and
Tyler-Smith quite useful. There is a review from Rock-
man in Hum Genet. 2004 May 13. It does not, though,
go into all other homonids.

answers
Dear All, Many thanks to those of you who replied to
our request for information on DNA sequencing costs.
We have listed the names of the diﬀerent companies
that sequence DNA below in no particular order. Note
that we have not given pricing for these companies,January 1, 2007 EvolDir 45
because prices are negotiable in most cases. Conse-
quently, we recommend that you explore each company
individually. Overall, however, it seems that moderate
throughput sequencing can be accomplished for as low
as $US 2.30/sample.

Mismatch distributions
Hi all- I am attempting to examine the demographic
history of a marine ﬁsh population using the mismatch
distribution of mtDNA sequences, and have run into
a snag. My mismatch distribution indicates a strong
wave, but right in the middle of the wave I have a single
data point (corresponding to 20-bp mismatch between
sequences) which has bottomed out. That is to say,
when comparing a large number of sequences, I have
1000+ comparisons that result in 18, 19, 21 and 22
mismatches, but only 193 comparisons resulted in 20-
bp mismatches. I am inclined to think this is a problem
with the way my data ﬁle is set up, but I have been un-
successful in all of my attempts to address the problem.
Has anyone else observed this problem, and, if so, can46 EvolDir January 1, 2007
you propose a solution?

Purchasing sequencer
I know this question has been asked before, but I can
not seem to ﬁnd it in the archives. We are in the process
of purchasing a new sequencer, and are considering ei-
ther an ABI3130 Avant or a Beckman CEQ8000. I am
very familiar with ABI, but have no experience with
Beckman. The instrument will be primarily used in
teaching and some research in a small liberal arts col-
lege setting, with anticipated medium to low through-
put, probably with some extended periods of down
time, and for both sequencing (PCR/cloned) and mi-
crosats. Any input concerning the Beckman would be
greatly appreciated, particularly in terms of ease of use,
reliable, and data quality. Thanks in advance.

SNPs SAP CIP questionDear all,
We have run into a peculiar technical problem when
scoring SNPs using ABI’s SNaPshot-kit, I wonder if
anyone has similar experiences. We recently started
to use SAP instead of CIP to purify the SNapShot re-
actions. This resulted in a dramatic increase in peak
heights in the ABI3100 runs. This was a desirable ef-
fect, but also brought along problems. First, some of
the reactions became saturated (with peak heights >10
000). Second, we occasionally started to see (allele spe-
ciﬁc) peaks in the negative controls. The curious thing
is that the peak heights of the size marker (LIZ120) also
increased substantially. The phenomenon is common
but rather random, popping up with several diﬀerent
loci. The phosphatase buﬀer does not seem to have
an eﬀect on the results (as opposed to water), nor do
the injection times. Can anyone explain what’s behind
this?
Thank you,

Software TESS 1 01 Spatial
Genetics Clustering
Dear evoldir members,
We would like to inform you about a new
STRUCTURE-like clustering program for windows.
TESS 1.01: Bayesian clustering using tessellations and
Markov models in spatial population genetics
TESS is a computer program that implements a
Bayesian clustering algorithm for spatial population ge-
netics. The method is based on a hierarchical mixture
model where the prior distribution on cluster labels is
deﬁned as a Hidden Markov Random Field. Given indi-
vidual geographical locations, the program seeks popu-
lation structure from multilocus genotypes without as-
suming predeﬁned populations. Instead the program
builds a network structure indicating which individu-
als should be considered genetically close to each other.TESS takes input data ﬁles in a format compatible to
STRUCTURE. It returns graphical displays of cluster
membership probabilities and geographical cluster as-
signments from its Graphical User Interface. Is it par-
ticularly useful for seeking genetic barriers or genetic
discontinuities in continuous populations.
The program is available at the following url
http://www-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/tess.html
Program sources are available on request for those
who wish to use a Linux version. The reference for the
method is <>

Molecular Evolution of salmonid invasions Evolution-
ary Impact of exotic aquaculture
Laboratory of Genetics & Aquaculture University of
Los Lagos (Osorno - Chile) in collaboration with:
University of Wales Swansea (UK), Centre for Ecology
& Hydrology (UK), Oregon State University (USA),
University of Victoria (Canada), US Geological Sur-
vey (USA), and Victoria University of Wellington (New
Zealand)
The Darwin Initiative Reducing the Impact of Ex-
otic Aquaculture on Chilean Aquatic Biodiversity
(www.biodiversity.cl ) is seeking two volunteers to help
assess the evolutionary impact of salmonid aquaculture
in Southern Chile (X Region), around the Puerto Montt
area.
Project This DEFRA-funded Darwin Initiative started
in October 2006, and is lead by the University of Wales
Swansea (UK) and the Universidad de Los Lagos (Os-
orno and Puerto Montt - Chile), in collaboration with
partners from USA, Canada and New Zealand. TheJanuary 1, 2007 EvolDir 49
project aims to evaluate, monitor, and eventually re-
duce, the impact of exotic cultured species on native
aquatic biodiversity.
Duties We are looking for two ﬁeld volunteers to help us
sample selected streams and lakes to monitor the dis-
tribution of exotic and naturalized salmonids, and to
evaluate the eﬀects of salmonid farms on local wildlife
(piscivorous birds and mammals mostly). Previous ex-
perience in ﬁsh sampling (electro-ﬁshing, netting), and
ecological monitoring in aquatic ecosystems would be
advantageous.
Period Most ﬁeld work is anticipated to take place dur-
ing January-June each year. There will be a probation
period, after which it is expected that the volunteers
would be able to commit for at least three months.
Qualiﬁcations Volunteers are expected to have a degree
in biology or life sciences. The positions are ideally
suited for postgraduate students who want to gain di-
rect ﬁeldwork experience in some of the most unique
and valuable aquatic ecosystems in the world. The ex-
perience would be particularly useful for persons con-
templating graduate studies or a career in environmen-
tal biology, aquatic ecology, or conservation. A driving
licence and knowledge of Spanish will be advantageous.
Applicants must be reliable, highly motivated and ca-
pable of living and working in ﬁeld conditions. Because
of the nature of the work, volunteers must be physically
ﬁt.
Costs The work is open to self-funded volunteers. We
will provide all the equipment and support but ﬁeld
volunteers are expected to cover their own transport
costs to Puerto Montt (largest city near study area),
including insurance and visas. Field transport, food,
and accommodation in Chile will be provided by the

GLOBES IGERT Fellowship Opportunity at University
of Notre Dame
Dear Colleagues,
Team GLOBES invites you to learn more about a pi-
oneering initiative and fellowship opportunity at the
University of Notre Dame. GLOBES is a new, inter-
disciplinary Ph.D. program studying Global Linkages
of Biology, the Environment, and Society. Launched
by funding from an IGERT (Integrated Graduate Ed-
ucation, Research and Traineeship) grant from the Na-
tional Science Foundation, GLOBES oﬀers a number
of unique interdisciplinary classes, symposium, confer-
ences, and research and education activities of both na-
tional and international scope mentored by faculty from
across the College of Science, the College of Arts and
Letters, and the Law School.
The central theme of GLOBES research projects is that
environmental degradation in the form of habitat de-
struction, biodiversity loss, water pollution, and the
spread of invasive species and infectious disease has in-
terrelated causes and feedbacks that are both biolog-
ical and social in nature. To address these problems
requires the coordinated eﬀort of biological and social
scientists working in concert with experts in public pol-
icy and the law.
Students who have a strong interest in team-based in-
terdisciplinary studies and research are encouraged to
apply. Fellowships, available to U.S. residents and per-
manent citizens, include generous yearly stipends, a full
waiver of graduate tuition, research and travel funds.
Application deadlines for Fall 2007 admission vary de-
pending on the home department of study. Participat-
ing departments include Biological Sciences (Jan. 15
deadline), Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Bio-
chemistry, Economics and Econometrics, History, Phi-
losophy, History and Philosophy of Science, and Theol-
ogy. For additional information on application proce-
dures, GLOBES faculty, home Ph.D. departments, re-
search facilities and the University of Notre Dame, visit

calization of putative organellar proteins, puriﬁcation
and proteomic analysis of these organelles, as well as
elucidation of organelle function from EST surveys of
anaerobic protists. The organisms we are studying in-
clude poorly studied unicellular eukaryote lineages and
will provide key insights into the early evolutionary his-
tory of mitochondria in the eukaryote lineage.

ExperimentalMarineEvol
G¨ oteborg University announces a position as
Post-doctoral researcher in Experimental Marine Ecol-
ogy
A Post-doctoral research position is available for the
project “Eﬀects of particulate matter and sedimenta-
tion on cold-water coral ecosystems” during the period
January 2007 to December 2008, at the Department of
Marine Ecology, G¨ oteborg University. This project is
part of a project ﬁnanced by Statoil under the “Inter-
national Research Consortium on Continental Margins”
coordinated by Prof. Laurenz Thomsen, Univ of Bre-
men. The project is also aﬃliated to the EU FP6 IP
HERMES (Hotspot Ecosystem Research on the Mar-
gins of European Seas).
Eﬀects of elevated levels of particulate matter and sed-
imentation on cold-water coral ecosystems are a matter
of great concern, as it has often been expressed that in-
creased levels of turbidity and sedimentation could have
negative eﬀects on growth and survival of the corals.
Potential mediators of increased sedimentation might
be oﬀshore drilling activities as well as trawling activ-
ities, leading to resuspension of particles. The project
will combine ﬁeld and laboratory studies to assess ef-
fects on corals of increased sedimentation and turbid-
ity, for example, using detailed mapping of coral reef
areas by ROV- and video-mosaic techniques to identify
areas of diﬀering coral health in which recording instru-
ments to study diﬀerences in hydrographic regime and
particle ﬂux dynamics will be installed. Laboratory ex-
periments will include exposure of live coral colonies
to diﬀering quantities and qualities of suspended mat-
ter, including drill-cutting material, studying eﬀects on
coral survival, growth rates and respiration. Studies
will be planned and designed in close co-operation with
other participating partners.
The successful applicant should have a proﬁciency in
experimental marine ecology including knowledge of
statistical design and analysis. Knowledge in coral
ecology/biology and/or hydrodynamics or small scale
oceanography will be judged as a merit.
The position is available at Tj¨ arn¨ o Marine Biological
Laboratory, a marine research station at G¨ oteborg and
Stockholm universities, situated on the west coast ofSweden close to the Norwegian border.

Phylogeny and tropical ecology postdoc
The Bridge project (funded by the French Research
Council ANR, 2007-2009, cf details below) oﬀers one
post-doctoral position for 16 months based in Toulouse,
France.
Essentials: You will hold a PhD in molecular phylo-
genetics or related ﬁelds with a proven expertise in
molecular systematics techniques (DNA extractions &
sequencing), preferably in plants. You will demonstrate
interest in the broader questions in evolutionary ecology
and tropical plant biodiversity studies. You will have a
proven publication record and strong motivation.
Job duties: As part of the Bridge project, you will
be responsible for developing a phylogenetic hypothesis
for all genera of angiosperm trees occurring in French
Guiana, a French overseas department. There is an
estimate of 380 tree genera in this 88,240 sq.km area
of Eastern South America. In collaboration with our
partners at the Herbier de Guyane (Cayenne, French
Guiana Drs Christopher Baraloto, Jean-Jacques de
Granville), and at the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew,
United Kingdom; Dr Vincent Savolainen), you will col-
lect herbarium or ﬁeld specimen of selected species in
the genera, will produce DNA sequences of selected
plastid regions (rbcL, matK), and will construct a
genus-level phylogenetic hypothesis for the tree ﬂora
of French Guiana. This will be the ﬁrst direct attempt
to create a robust phylogenetic hypothesis at the genus
level for all tree species of a tropical forest area, and will
serve as a basis for the analysis of the evolution of plant
traits, to which the Research Associate will contribute58 EvolDir January 1, 2007
actively. This research will involve one trip (possibly
two) to French Guiana and to the United Kingdom
(KEW).

Summary of the BRIDGE project: Why are there so
many coexisting species of tropical trees? Niche the-
ory predicts that in a local community, each species
possesses a unique combination of traits (the species
niche), that enables it to avoid competition with other
species. In contrast, the recently developed neutral the-
ory of biodiversity ascribes no role to competition and
niches for local species coexistence. According to the
neutral theory, dispersal limitation and demographic
ﬂuctuations overwhelm the deterministic processes of
competitive exclusion. This project will (i) assem-
ble a unique database combining ecological, physiolog-
ical, and genetic information in several tropical forest
tree communities of French Guiana, (ii) develop an un-
precedented test of existing theories of biodiversity by
combining ﬁeld data and novel modelling approaches,
and (iii) strengthen research in a French biodiversity
hotspot. We will sample ten one-hectare old-growth
forest tree plots across a range of geology and rainfall
in French Guiana. Using molecular techniques, we will
develop a reﬁned phylogenetic hypothesis for the tree
species found in our plots, and we will provide aids
for molecular-based identiﬁcation. We will measure the
amount of niche conservatism across an ecologically rel-
evant set of functional, reproductive, and defense traits,
as measured in the ﬁeld. We will use novel modelling
methods to test whether existing species assemblages
are a random sample of the regional species pool, and
to assess the contribution of niche partitioning to the
coexistence of tropical trees.

Project: Mating gifts of D. melanogaster males: func-

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE
FIXED TREM APPOINTMENT FOR 13 MONTHS
Salary: 26,402 GBP Ref: RA354
A BBSRC-funded post is available to work on the
functions and ﬁtness eﬀects of male seminal ﬂuid
proteins in fruitﬂies, with Dr Tracey Chapman
(http://bioweb2.bio.uea.ac.uk/bioperson/facultyasp/-
ChapmanT.aspx ) at the University of East Anglia.
The post will be based full-time at UEA for a ﬁxed
term of 13 months and should start by early spring
2007.
Project summary: In many insects, mating induces
striking changes in the behaviour and physiology of fe-
males. These post-mating responses (PMRs) of females
are of interest because of their potential utility in in-
sect pest control and because they appear to be subject
to unusually strong natural selection. They therefore
provide a unique model of adaptive evolution at the
genetic level. In D. melanogaster, PMRs are caused
by the transfer of accessory gland proteins (Acps). In
addition to their eﬀects on female receptivity and egg
production, Acps also play a crucial role in sperm stor-
age, mating plug formation and egg fertility. The aimJanuary 1, 2007 EvolDir 61
of this project is to investigate the ﬁtness eﬀects of spe-
ciﬁc Acps in large-scale assays. We have generated large
numbers of Acp-deﬁcient stocks and aim now to exam-
ine the ﬁtness eﬀects of the transfer of the Acps targeted
in these Acp-deﬁcient lines, determine which sex ben-
eﬁts from their transfer and test for functional redun-
dancy between Acps. Some of the work is being done
collaboratively with the Mariana Wolfner laboratory in
Cornell.
Qualiﬁcations: You must have, or expect to be awarded
within 6 months of appointment, a PhD (or equivalent)
in a relevant discipline. Experience in working with
fruitﬂies and in molecular genetic techniques is essen-
tial.
Informal enquiries can be made to Tracey Chapman

Project 1: The cellular mechanisms of parasite-induced
feminisation in arthropod hosts.
A NERC-BBSRC-funded postdoctoral post is available
immediately, for up to three years, to investigate the
cellular mechanisms of parasite-induced feminisation
of arthropod hosts. Parasitic sex ratio distorters are
widespread in invertebrate hosts. Vertically transmit-
ted parasites are uniparentally inherited and selection
to enhance the relative frequency of the transmitting
sex has led to the evolution of a number of strategies of
sex ratio distortion. Feminisation is induced by the bac-
terium Wolbachia in the Crustacea including Armadil-
lidium vulgare and by microsporidia (eukaryote para-
sites) in the Crustacea including Gammarus duebeni.
Whilst Wolbachia induces feminisation in Crustacea,
in insects including Drosophila bifasciata it may cause
male killing. We propose that these intracellular para-
sites are most likely to act by secreting molecules into
the host cell which will then inﬂuence host molecular
pathways, they may modify the response to external
hormonal signals or even induce programmed cell death
(apoptosis). Such changes could disrupt patterns of
sexual development or lead to sex-speciﬁc embryo mor-
tality.
This post is concerned with the cellular basis of Wol-
bachia and microsporidia induced feminisation. You
will map parasite distribution during host sexual diﬀer-
entiation using in situ hybridisation and map patterns
of apoptosis during development using TUNEL mark-
ers and investigate the impact of parasitism on host
signalling through investigation of phosphorylation of
host proteins.

Project 1: The cellular mechanisms of parasite-induced
feminisation in arthropod hosts.
A NERC-BBSRC-funded postdoctoral post is available
immediately, for up to three years, to investigate the
cellular mechanisms of parasite-induced feminisation
of arthropod hosts. Parasitic sex ratio distorters are
widespread in invertebrate hosts. Vertically transmit-
ted parasites are uniparentally inherited and selection
to enhance the relative frequency of the transmitting
sex has led to the evolution of a number of strategies of
sex ratio distortion. Feminisation is induced by the bac-terium Wolbachia in the Crustacea including Armadil-
lidium vulgare and by microsporidia (eukaryote para-
sites) in the Crustacea including Gammarus duebeni.
Whilst Wolbachia induces feminisation in Crustacea,
in insects including Drosophila bifasciata it may cause
male killing. We propose that these intracellular para-
sites are most likely to act by secreting molecules into
the host cell which will then inﬂuence host molecular
pathways, they may modify the response to external
hormonal signals or even induce programmed cell death
(apoptosis). Such changes could disrupt patterns of
sexual development or lead to sex-speciﬁc embryo mor-
tality.
This post is concerned with the cellular basis of Wol-
bachia and microsporidia induced feminisation. You
will map parasite distribution during host sexual diﬀer-
entiation using in situ hybridisation and map patterns
of apoptosis during development using TUNEL mark-
ers and investigate the impact of parasitism on host
signalling through investigation of phosphorylation of
host proteins.

UParis PigeonPopGenet
Postdoc opportunity: population genetics of urban pi-geons
A one year post-doctoral position is available in the
Ecology, Systematic and Evolution laboratory of Uni-
versity Paris 11 (located in the suburb of Paris, France),
to work on the population genetics of urban pigeons.
The subject proposed to the postdoc is part of a bigger
project on urban biodiversity. One of the main goals
of conservation biology is to study Human-Nature re-
lationships, in order to allow sustainable development
and biodiversity conservation. Feral urban pigeons rep-
resent a very good model in this context, since the pres-
ence of pigeons in cities is depending on diﬀerent civic
actors defending opposite arguments for and against
pigeon’s presence. Pigeons breeding structures (with
abundant food but where reproduction is controlled),
installed in many urban cities as a management and me-
diation response, oﬀer an interesting design to answer
both biological and social questions. We are studying
how these breeding structures modify urban pigeon’s
population dynamics and selective pressures on this
species and how these structures inﬂuence citizen per-
ceptions about pigeons The postdoc is expected to work
in the following areas :(i) Determination of the popu-
lation structure of urban pigeons using microsatellites
and comparison of the variability of urban pigeons with
those of the remaining wild birds, (ii) study of the in-
ﬂuence of urban habitat heterogeneity (e.g. in terms
of resource availability, level of pollution and parasite
loads on neutral (microsatellite) and non neutral (ma-
jor histocompatibility complex) genetic variability.
We are looking for someone with a background in ex-
perimental population genetics and interests in conser-
vation biology. Some knowledge of French would be
helpful but is not mandatory. The position is for one
year and must start around February 2007. Salary is
21 000 euros /year (1750/month; including social secu-
rity).

UParisSudXI Barcoding
Postdoctoral fellowship on Classiﬁcation methods for
DNA barcoding.
DNA Barcoding consists in assigning an individual to a
given species according to the sequence of this individ-
ual at a given locus (for the animals, often a fraction
of the COI mitochondrial DNA gene). The technique
consists ﬁrst in sequencing a sample of reference indi-
viduals for which the taxonomic status is unambiguous.
This reference sample is then used as a training data
set for a classiﬁcation algorithm, which aims at assign-
ing newly sampled individuals to a given species on the
basis of their DNA sequence only.
The postdoctoral fellow will work in particular in the
development and comparison of the eﬃciency of vari-
ous classiﬁcation algorithms in this context. These al-
gorithms include classical phylogenetic methods (e.g.
neighbour joining, maximum likelihood), statistical
classiﬁcation methods (e.g. CART, Random For-
est, neural networks, kernel and SVM methods) and
coalescent-based methods. Methods that take advan-
tage of recent advances in statistical learning and in-
ference, and in population genetics will be favoured in
particular. The comparisons will be carried out on sim-
ulated data sets and also on well-characterized exper-
imental data sets. In particular, the impact on the
eﬃciency of the diﬀerent methods of events like gene
ﬂow between species or population expansions will be
investigated. The contribution of additional informa-
tion at nuclear loci will also be considered. Finally the
question of the detection of new species might also be
addressed.
The position is opened for one year with a possibility
of renewal for a second year. It should start in March
2007. The salary will be around 1800 euros/month.
The postdoctoral fellow will be mainly located at the
Unite Mathematiques et Informatique Appliquees of
the INRA - Jouy-en-Josas, near Paris, in strong interac-
tions with two other laboratories (see below). A strong
background in mathematics, statistics and computer
science is requested for this position. An experience
in interacting with biologists, especially population ge-
neticists, will be a plus.
Interested candidates are invited to submit by email to

following elements.- a CV with a list of publications - two or three rel-
evant publications - an application letter - the names
and e-mail addresses of three referees.

available immediately, each for 18 months, to inves-
tigate the symbiosis in arthropod hosts. The EN-
DOSYMBART project is linked to a Genoscope-funded
project Immune Genomics in Invertebrate Endosymbio-

of host-symbiont interactions in an evolutionary per-66 EvolDir January 1, 2007
spective. Nutritional symbiosis in insects is studied
worldwide and genomic data on these systems have
provided the foundation of the theory of evolution of
intracellular bacteria. More recently, increasing inter-
est in arthropod symbiosis arose from the discovery
that various and frequent bacteria are able to manip-
ulate the reproduction of their hosts (e.g. Wolbachia),
challenging classical theories on the evolution of host-
symbiont relationships, and opening avenue for devel-
oping new control method of arthropod pests and vec-
tors. The ENDOSYMBART project goal is to decipher
the genetic, cellular and molecular bases governing the
dynamics and evolution of symbiosis using a compar-
ative approach between three model systems: nutri-
tional symbiosis of recent origin, between the weevil
Sitophilus oryzae and its symbiont SOPE; recent tran-
sition towards mutualism in the association between an
hymenopteran wasp and Wolbachia that is necessary
for oogenesis completion; and reproductive manipula-
tion through feminization of genetic crustacean isopod
males by Wolbachia. These are full-time 18 months po-
sitions that will open in January 2007. Salary is around
2000 euros/month. The 3 projects are linked and the
candidates will interact with other members of the EN-
DOSYMBART consortium.

2 year postdoc position on Diversiﬁcation of Plant Lin-
eages within Habitats
->At University of Rennes 1, France; Institute
“Ecosystems, Biodiversity, Evolution”; Group “Ecol-
ogy of Diversiﬁcation” (Andreas Prinzing)
->From beginning of next year, latest early spring.
Position is given for one year, renewable, without prob-
lems, for one year. (Review of applications starting
JANUARY 7.)
->The project:
The major hypothesis for the project is that habitat
types drive evolutionary diversiﬁcation of plant lin-January 1, 2007 EvolDir 67
eages.
Most evolutionary biologists have a hierarchical view of
local species communities: Communities are assembled
from a regional pool of already-evolved species via a
habitat ﬁlter acting on already-evolved traits. In our
project we will explore the opposite view: whether and
how the ecological conditions within diﬀerent types of
habitats may aﬀect the pattern and pace of evolution-
ary diversiﬁcation of phylogenetic lineages across geo-
logical time scales. We particularly account for eﬀects
of habitats on genetic variation, divisions of gene pools,
and local persistence of genetic isolates. We are espe-
cially interested in eﬀects mediated by genomic and life
history traits of the species. This research will allow
us to explore how mechanisms of diversiﬁcation depend
on the ecological context.
The major methodological approach is the analysis of
databases on the phylogeny, habitat use, co-existence
and life history of central European plant species, in
order to reconstruct ancestral habitats, traits and how
they triggered the pace and pattern of evolution. We
aim for collecting additional information on the genome
size of species, a still under-recorded trait linked to both
environment and diversiﬁcation.
->Eligible are holders of a PHD except French citizens
(constraint imposed by the funding agency)
->Characters of the ideal candidate (declining from
essential to preferred):
- competencies in using phylogenies as a tool to study
for instance the role of species traits or environments
on the evolution of lineages (not to be confused with
phylogeny reconstruction or with phylogenetically in-
dependent comparative analyses)
- competencies in the analysis of patterns in phylo-
genetic trees (e.g. diversiﬁcation rates, directional
evolution of traits, character reconstruction, random-
ness/symmetry/asymmetry in branching patterns)
- strong publication record
- programming capabilities for instance for null model-
ing
- willingness to do ﬁeld work such as sampling plant
species for genome size investigation (done by an ex-
ternal lab), but also to spend lots of time on data base
mining and statistical modelling
- general knowledge of habitat types and their vegeta-
tion, of Angiosperm phylogeny, of palaeo-environments
throughout the evolution of Angiosperms, and of An-
giosperm life history
- strong overall statistical skills- ability to work independently; contribute to discussion
on research of others; respect (for most of the time) the
constraints of a general theme predeﬁned by a research
proposal
->Research environment:
The host institution is the Research Unit “Ecosys-
tems, Biodiversity, Evolution”, co-funded by Uni-
versity of Rennes 1 and Centre National de la
Recherche Scientiﬁque, harboring 58 researchers and
teachers. Several further research institutions in ecol-

sponsored by the
Center for Biosystematics and Bodega Marine Labora-
tory,
University of California, Davis
http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/sandlab/ap.htm Introduc-
tion. Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized mod-
ern systematics and become indispensable tools in evo-
lution, ecology and comparative biology, playing an
increasingly important role in analyses of biological
data at levels of organization ranging from molecules
to ecosystems. The construction of phylogenetic trees
is becoming a methodology that is well-deﬁned, with
broad agreement on the central issues and questions.
A nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, applications of phylogenetic methods to
interesting problems outside of systematics is an area
of special excitement, innovation, and controversy, and
perspectives vary widely.
In March, 2007, for the eighth year, we will teach a
workshop for graduate students interested in apply-
ing phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in biology.
The one-week course will be an intensive exploration of
problems to which modern phylogenetic tools are being
applied, including topics in biogeography, ecology, con-
servation biology, phylogenomics, functional morphol-
ogy, macroevolution, speciation, and character evolu-
tion. The course leads oﬀ with recent advances in phy-
logenetic methodology, and then turns to methods andtools that can be brought to bear to address these “ap-
plied” issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held entirely at Bodega Marine Lab
on the Northern California coast, which has extensive
computing resources and on-site housing. The course
format will involve equal parts of lecture, discussion,
and training in software and internet tools. One after-
noon during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips to
local natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Finding, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees; phylogenetic databases * Recent advances in
tree reconstruction: Bayesian inference; stochastic op-
timization strategies; divide-and-conquer methods *
Analysis of character evolution–theory: parsimony,
likelihood and Bayesian approaches; null models and
statistical testing * Analysis of character evolution–

WORKSHOP Darwin Initiative. First International
Workshop Evolutionary Impact of Exotic Aquaculture
on Native Aquatic Biodiversity Puerto Montt (Chile)
- 17-19 January 2007 More information on http:/-

2. Aim Aquaculture in Chile is a large-scale, emerging
industry based chieﬂy on the culture of exotic species in
some of the most pristine and environmentally sensitive
aquatic ecosystems in the world. Yet, exotic species can
have a major impact on native biodiversity, and sound
scientiﬁc information is needed to help farm managers
and policy makers take appropriate decisions designedto protect natural resources and a valuable industry.
This workshop aims to bridge the gap for sustainable
aquaculture by exploring ways of monitoring and re-
ducing damage to native aquatic ecosystems.
3. Structure of the workshop The workshop will consist
of four major components: i) scientiﬁc meeting (scien-
tiﬁc panel - 15 Jan); ii) meeting with stakeholders -
16 Jan ; iii) open conference (17-19 Jan 2007: series of
public lectures and oral presentations on “Evolutionary
Impact and mitigation of exotic aquaculture on native
species”) iv) Excursion and ﬁeld trip (20-21 January).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoralJanuary 1, 2007 EvolDir 71
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
