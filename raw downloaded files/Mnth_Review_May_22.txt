AsilomarCalifornia.ASN Symposium Call.2023
The American Society of Naturalists
Proposals for Symposia at the ASN stand-alone meeting
in Asilomar 2023
Due July 01, 2022
The American Society of Naturalists will be going back
to Asilomar in Pacic Grove, California, to hold our
stand-alone conference - Asilomar 2023 - on 6-10 Jan-
uary 2023!
Have an idea for a special symposium? We want to hear
it!
The ASN Symposium Committee invites you to submit
proposals for a special symposium. Proposed sympo-
sium topics should support the Society's goal to advance
the conceptual unication of the biological sciences and
to further knowledge in evolution, ecology, behavior,
and organismal biology. Topics could center around
important emerging issues in evolution, ecology, or be-
havior or focus on a pivotal historical paper, tracingits impact and exploring current cutting-edge research
inspired by this work. A budget of up to $8,000 is avail-
able to defray travel, registration, and lodging costs for
speakers.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (up to one page); (3) a list of six
speakers, including institutional aliations, who have
agreed to participate in the symposium; (4) a justica-
tion for the symposium, explaining why the topic and
speakers are appropriate for an ASN symposium (up to
one page).
Please submit proposals by email
(rachel.spigler[at]temple.edu) no later than mid-
night Eastern Time on July 01, 2022. Send your
proposal as a single pdf attachment, under subject
heading \ASN Asilomar 2023 Symposium Proposal". A
conrmation email will be sent within 1-2d of receipt.
In line with theASN'scommitment to diversity, we en-
courage including speakers from groups who have been
historically excluded from STEM. Therefore, proposals
that include a diverse list of speakers from a range of
backgrounds, institutions, career stages, geography, gen-
der, race etc.are especially encouraged. The Society's
selection committee will evaluate proposals based on
their potential to attracting substantial audience and
stimulate discussion, the signicance and timeliness of
the topic, and on the topic's diering substantively fromMay 1, 2022 EvolDir 3
recent symposia hosted by the Society. Applicants will
be notied of the decision before the end of July 2022.

CIGENE HumanGut Apr6
Hi all!
The next seminar is in just one week and we are thrilled
to present our internal speaker; Dr. Sabina Leanti La
Rosa, researcher at NMBU, who will present:
Decrypting the mechanism for xanthan gum process-
ing by human gut bacteria through multi-omics and
enzymology
Abstract: Microbial communities and their enzymes
process many of the \typical" dietary nutrients acces-
sible in the human gastrointestinal tract and play an
essential role in host health and nutrition. Eating habits
of industrialized countries and gluten-free diets reect
an increasing consumption of processed foods, hence
concomitant increased intakes of \atypical" nutrients
such as food additives. While often believed to be
inert, little is known about the interactions of food ad-
ditives with the human gut microbiota and their fate
in the gut. In this talk, I will present results showing
that the human gut microbiota can process xanthan
gum, a common food additive used in bakery prod-
ucts, beverages and in gluten-free foods. Metagenomic
and metatranscriptomic analyses revealed the presence
of a common uncultured Ruminococcaceae genus (R.
UCG13) equipped with a gene cluster responsive to xan-
than gum. Detailed biochemical studies supported a
model whereby extracellular hydrolysis of xanthan gum
generates oligosaccharides that are subsequently depoly-
merized to monosaccharides by a cocktail of intracellular
enzymes. In some cases, oligosaccharides produced by
the primary degrader R. UCG13 also cross-feed other
bacterial populations equipped with their own specic
catabolic pathway. A survey of 2441 public human gut
metagenomes revealed the broad, diet-specic, distribu-
tion of these xanthan utilization loci across the world.
Overall, we show that this food additive is not inert
and has driven the evolution of interlinked trophic rela-
tionships between at least two populations within the
human gut microbiota, an adaptation that reects theincorporation of xanthan gum into human diets in the
past 50 years.

ESEBSymposium TandemRepeats
2022
Dear evoldir community,
We would be very happy to welcome you at our
ESEB 2022 symposium \Tandem repeats: their role
in molecular evolution and methods" (S27), which
is open for submissions until April 15th (seehttps:/-
/www.eseb2022.czfor further details).
Keynote speakers:
Melissa Gymrek, UCSD, California
Miguel Andrade, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz
Abstracts can be submitted on:
https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-page.
Deadline is April15 2022.
Tandem repeats (TRs) are adjacent repetitive stretches
of genomic DNA, found in abundance across all king-
doms of life. TRs provide a rich source of variationin populations, hence a perfect playground for natural
selection forces. Especially, shorter TRs are known for
their orders of magnitude high mutation rates compared
to SNPs and indels. TR-suitable methods and resources
are emerging one after the other allowing accurate TR
annotation and genotyping integrated into existing ge-
nomic pipeline workows. Analysis of TR variation in
populations and over longer evolutionary time suggest
STRs as a major contributor to complex traits heri-
tability with a major impact on protein function and
expression.
This symposium will focus on the typing approaches,
evolution, and functional analysis of these highly poly-
morphic elements. We aim to bring together both re-
searchers who develop and apply methods for accurate
STR genotyping, and identication of STRs relevant
for phenotypic evolution, and recent adaptations. This
way, the symposium will facilitate interactions between
researchers from dierent backgrounds and promote the
interdisciplinary study of the STRs, an emerging major
source of phenotypic variation. Therefore, we expect
this symposium to be of interest to a broad range of
researchers in the elds of bioinformatics, population
genomics, and evolutionary biology.

Online ConGen Sep6-17
CONGEN 2022: September 6-17, 2022 Conservation
Genetics, Population Genomics, and Molecular Ecology
Workshop
The goal of ConGen 2022 is to provide training in con-
ceptual and practical aspects of population genomic
data analyses to improve understanding of the evolu-
tionary and ecological genomics of natural and managed
populations. >1
2We will have more than 15 expert in-
structors from multiple countries to help teach a breadth
of concepts and applications.
ConGen teaches fundamental statistical and computa-
tional approaches that will help prepare students and
professionals to use population genomic data in their
work. Emphasis will be on next-generation sequence
(NGS) data analysis (RADs, DNA capture, and genome
sequencing/resequencing) and interpretation of output
from fundamental and novel statistical approaches and
software programs (including R and Linux command
line). The course promotes interactions among early-
career researchers (e.g., grad students & postdocs), mid-
career faculty and agency researchers, and leaders in
population genomics to help develop our \next gen-eration" of conservation and evolutionary geneticists.
We will identify and discuss developments needed to
improve data analysis approaches to advance the eld.
This course often feels like a workshop because multiple
instructors ask questions and provide helpful comments
during another instructor's lecture to help advance learn-
ing of basic and advanced concepts and approaches.
This course will cover concepts and methods includ-
ing the coalescent, Bayesian, and likelihood-based ap-
proaches. Special lecture sessions and hands-on exer-
cises will be conducted on assessing population structure,
testing for HW proportions, detecting selection, genetic
monitoring (of >1
2Ne, >1
2FST, >1
2Nm, >1
2etc.), landscape
genomics, inbreeding detection (RoH), GWAS, popula-
tion assignment, gene ow estimation, whole-genome
sequencing & assembly, and more. It will include daily
sessions with hands-on data analysis activities, including
genotyping and data analyses using NGS data.
This course is sponsored by the American Genetic
Association, the Journal of Heredity, NASA (the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration), NSF
(the Dimensions in Biodiversity program), along with
DoveTail Genomics, and support from publications such
as Environmental DNA, Evolutionary Applications,
Molecular Ecology Resources, and Conservation
Genetics. Some sponsors give talks on new and
future technologies (e.g., Dovetail, PacBio). Many
of the expert instructors will lead hands-on data
analysis sessions using your data and dummy data sets
provided by instructors. This course/workshop has
led to publications describing the main topics, course
outcomes, and recent advances in the eld that facilitate
data analysis for population geneticists worldwide. >1

COMBINING EVOLUTION AND PROTEOMICS TO
DISCOVER PROTEIN COMPLEXES CONSERVED

Participation is free for members of ISCB or SMBE,
but registration is required. https://www.iscb.org/-
cmsaddon/registration conference/cosi28 Plants are
are foundational for global ecological and economic sys-
tems, but most plant proteins and and many protein
complexes remain uncharacterized. In plants, highly du-
plicated protein families pose challenges for protein iden-
tication, which is heavily reliant on unique peptides.
To address this problem, we developed an evolution-
informed proteomics strategy that combines orthology
analysis with mass spectrometry. We applied this strat-
egy to 13 plant species of scientic and agricultural
importance, greatly expanding the known repertoire of
stable protein complexes in plants. We recovered known
complexes, conrmed complexes predicted to occur in
plants, and identied previously unknown interactions
conserved over 1.1 billion years of green plant evolu-
tion. The resulting map oers a cross-species view ofconserved, stable protein assemblies shared across plant
cells and provides a mechanistic, biochemical framework
for interpreting plant genetics and mutant phenotypes.

present:
Insights into the ne-scale population structure and con-
tributions of ancient genetic adaptations to metabolic
traits in modern-day Kuwaiti Arabs.
Abstract: Being at the crossroads between Africa and
Eurasia, the Arabian Peninsula has experienced several
waves of human migrations despite the prevailing ex-
treme and varying environmental conditions; therefore,
the resident populations have a high genetic diversity.
In this talk, I will present our recent works that ex-
plored the regional genetic heterogeneities and admix-
ture history of populations inhabiting the Peninsula.
In addition, I will highlight interesting ancient genetic
adaptations once key to survival for Kuwaiti ancestors
in the harsh desert environment that predispose their
descendants to debilitating metabolic diseases.

Online LowMutationLoad Apr27
Hi all!
The next seminar is in just one week and we are pleased
to present Professor Leif Andersson, Uppsala University.
He will give a talk entitled:
Low mutation load in a supergene underpinning alter-
native male mating strategies in ru.
Abstract: Rus are shorebirds with an elaborate lekking
behavior involving three male morphs with dierent
mating strategies: Independents, Satellites, and Faeders.
The latter two are heterozygous for dierent versions
of a supergene maintained by an inversion that were
estimated to have occurred about 4 million years ago.
Faeders carry an intact inversion while the Satellite allele
is recombinant, both of which are expected to accumu-
late high mutational load because they are recessive
lethals. Here we have constructed a highly contiguous
genome assembly of the inversion region for both the In-
dependent and Satellite haplotypes. The recombination
event(s) between an inverted and non-inverted chromo-
some creating the Satellite allele must have occurred
recently (within the last 100,000 years) based on the
minute sequence divergence between the Satellite and
Independent alleles in the recombinant regions. Con-
trary to expectations, we nd no expansion of repeats
and only a very modest mutation load on the Satel-
lite allele in the nonrecombinant region despite high
sequence divergence (1.46%). The essential centromere
protein CENPN gene is disrupted by the inversion, and
surprisingly is as well conserved on the inversion hap-
lotypes as on the noninversion haplotype. The results
suggest that the inversion may be much younger than
previously thought.

Title: Recoverability of ancestral recombination graph
topologies
Abstract:
Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) are the exten-
sion of phylogenetic trees to include recombination, a
powerful evolutionary process that shapes the genetic di-
versity of many species. The topology of this graph gives
us important information on the evolution of a species,
but algorithms to reconstruct an ARG from species data
are often reliant on sample sequences carrying informa-
tive patterns of mutations. In this talk I will present
exact results concerning the probability of recovering
the true topology of an ARG under the coalescent with
recombination and gene conversion. These expressions
give us an indication of the uncertainty in reconstructed
ARGs, and we see that for parameter values realistic for
biological species (in particular SARS-CoV-2), the prob-
ability of reconstructing genealogies that are close to the
truth is low. This is joint work with Anastasia Ignatieva
and Jotun Hein (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04848).

DomesticationWithAncientDNA
Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
We'd like to kindly remind you that the abstract submis-sion deadline for our symposium titled \Domestication:
Fresh insights from ancient genomics" is approaching.
The symposium will be part of the ESEB meeting in
Prague between August 14-19, 2022.
More information about the ESEB meeting can be found
below and at the conference website: www.eseb2022.cz
S33: Domestication: Fresh insights from ancient ge-
nomics
Animal and plant domestication events have fundamen-
tally changed human societies in multitude ways, while
biologically shaping the domesticated species themselves.
The tempo and mode of domestication processes, the
subsequent dynamics of transport, breeding and intro-
gression between domesticates and their wild relatives,
the genetic bases of selected traits, as well as the so-
cial and biological impacts of animal husbandry and
farming on humans have long been investigated, using
either archaeological evidence or inferences from biolog-
ical studies of extant species. The advent of ancient
genomics, however, has been a game changer. The last
few years have seen a wide range of spectacular work
that rewrote domestication histories of dierent species,
from dogs to chicken. This session aims to bring to-
gether the most recent and exciting work on animal and
plant domestication, covering both the reconstruction
of demographic history, analyses of selective sweeps, ev-
idence for relaxation of constraints, as well as studies
on ancient pathogens.

RapidEvolutionOfColorPatterns
Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
The abstract submission deadline for the ESEB 2022
conference has been extended to the 22nd of April, so
there is still time to submit your abstract to our sym-
posium S15 \Rapid evolution of color patterns".
The symposium will be held at the Congress of the Euro-
pean Society for Evolutionary Biology in Prague, 14-19
August 2022 (https://www.eseb2022.cz/). Symposium
description
Animal and plant color patterns are labile characters
that are involved in important biological functions such
as reproduction, predator evasion, pollinator attraction,
and thermoregulation. A fascinating feature of color vari-
ation is that it can evolve rapidly in new environments,
as highlighted by dramatic examples in peppered moths,
cichlid shes, and *Heliconius* butteries. Beyond these
classic cases, technological advances in high-throughput
sequencing, phenotyping, and gene editing, have opened
new pathways to study rapid evolution using color pat-
terns in a diversity of models. Among other examples,
recent studies have highlighted the role of transpos-
able elements in bualo coat coloration, chromosome
re-arrangement in buttery wing patterns, and trans-
generational plasticity in ower coloration in response
to predation. This symposium will assemble researchers
who use animal and plant color patterns as models to
evaluate the diversity of factors driving and constraining
rapid phenotypic evolution. We will foster transdisci-
plinary discussions addressing long-standing questions
on the genetic substrate of recurrent adaptation and
the mechanistic scale of convergence. Ultimately, we
hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of
the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation.

Dear colleagues, Submission deadline for the ESEB 2022

Abstract
It is now accepted that rapid evolution (within a dozen
generations) can occur, contrary to the classical Dar-
winian view that assumes slow pace of evolution. Rapid
evolution is particularly frequent in response to contem-
porary anthropogenic modication of the environment
(e.g. climate change, pollution), although demonstrating
its adaptive character remains challenging.
Resurrection ecology (RE) is an inventive approach to
study evolution based on the ancestral populations re-
viving (decades old) from dormant forms (seeds, spores,
cysts). Comparing ancestral and current genotypes is a
powerful methodology for demonstrating adaptive rapid
evolution, although often limited by the fortuitous avail-
ability of ancestral material in sediments or seed banks.
Being at its beginnings, it is important that good REpractices are established to set up the premises for future
studies.
This symposium covers various challenges and innova-
tions of RE: 1) practical issues such as constituting or
recovering appropriate propagule banks, their conser-
vation, and the limits of available model organisms in
relation to their life history traits, 2) analytical method-
ology (population and quantitative genetics) disentan-
gling selective from stochastic evolutionary processes,
and 3) case studies in various organisms illustrating the
power of RE to demonstrate rapid evolution. We thus
aim at providing insights into RE possibilities, but also
inspiring actions for future RE studies.

Prague PredatorCognition Aug14-19
Dear colleagues,
Abstract submission deadline for the ESEB 2022
Congress has been extended until 22 April, so if you are
considering attending the symposium \Predator cogni-
tion and the evolution of prey defence strategies" (S.16),
there is a little more time for submitting your abstracts.
The meeting will be held in Prague, Czech Republic
on 14-19 August 2022; see https://www.eseb2022.cz for
further details.
Symposium description: Animals employ numerous
strategies to avoid predation, and the evolution of cam-
ouage, aposematism, mimicry and other forms of an-
tipredator defence is at the core of research interest
of evolutionary biologists. As shown by recent studies14 EvolDir May 1, 2022
focused on interactions between prey defences and preda-
tor cognitive mechanisms, understanding the selective
forces driving the evolution of prey defence strategies
requires studying their coevolution with predator percep-
tion, cognition, and subsequent behavioural responses.
Furthermore, these studies have also highlighted the
importance of studying predator cognition in ecologi-
cally relevant settings and testing behavioural responses
in addition to investigating sensory capabilities. This
approach has made it possible to address new questions,
such as what factors inuence predator decisions to
attack potentially dangerous prey, how prey defences
and predator cognitive mechanisms interact through the
predation sequence, how predators respond to multicom-
ponent and multimodal defences, and how predators
use individual and social information about prey. This
symposium aims to bring together current experimental,
comparative and theoretical approaches to study interac-
tions between predator cognitive mechanisms and prey
defence strategies, identify the factors shaping predator
behavioural responses, establish critical gaps in our un-
derstanding of the evolution of antipredator defences,
and outline directions for future research.
Our keynote speakers are Johanna Mappes (University
of Helsinki) and Tom Sherratt (Carleton University).
Abstracts can be submitted on: https://-
www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-page. The
call is open until the 22nd of April 2022.
Early-bird registration is open until the 15th of June
2022.
ESEB also proposes a conference attendance aid
grant. For further details, see: https://eseb.org/-

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS CLOSES 22 APRIL
Dear colleagues,
The call for abstracts for the ESEB 2022 Congress closes
on 22 April, so if you are planning to attend the sym-
posium \Predator cognition and the evolution of prey
defence strategies" (S.16), please submit your abstract
at your earliest convenience.
You can access the abstract submission portal by visit-
ing https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-page
. The meeting will be held in Prague, Czech Republic
on 14-19 August 2022; see https://www.eseb2022.cz for
further details.
Early-bird registration is open until the 15th of June
2022.
Symposium description: Animals employ numerous
strategies to avoid predation, and the evolution of cam-
ouage, aposematism, mimicry and other forms of an-
tipredator defence is at the core of research interest
of evolutionary biologists. As shown by recent studies
focused on interactions between prey defences and preda-
tor cognitive mechanisms, understanding the selective
forces driving the evolution of prey defence strategies
requires studying their coevolution with predator percep-
tion, cognition, and subsequent behavioural responses.
Furthermore, these studies have also highlighted the
importance of studying predator cognition in ecologi-
cally relevant settings and testing behavioural responses
in addition to investigating sensory capabilities. This
approach has made it possible to address new questions,
such as what factors inuence predator decisions to
attack potentially dangerous prey, how prey defences
and predator cognitive mechanisms interact through the
predation sequence, how predators respond to multicom-
ponent and multimodal defences, and how predators
use individual and social information about prey. This
symposium aims to bring together current experimental,
comparative and theoretical approaches to study interac-
tions between predator cognitive mechanisms and prey
defence strategies, identify the factors shaping predator
behavioural responses, establish critical gaps in our un-
derstanding of the evolution of antipredator defences,
and outline directions for future research.

Ol a jovens amigos,
please consider submitting an abstract to the *ESEB
2022 symposium: S09. Parallel and repeated evolu-
tion in adaptive radiation*; organized by me, Rosemary
Gillespie and Michael D. Martin.
*Invited talks* Jae Young Choi - \Ancestral polymor-
phisms shape the adaptive radiation of Metrosideros

nomics of parallel adaptive radiations in cichlid shes

sistence of polymorphisms across species radiations"
*Symposium description* The interplay between abiotic
and biotic factors in shaping evolution is best under-
stood when species evolve repeatedly under similar se-16 EvolDir May 1, 2022
lective regimes, providing evolutionary 'replicates' to
understand the processes of adaptation and diversi-
cation. Adaptive radiation, in particular, can often
provide a link between lineage diversication, ecology
and the phenotype. Recent advances in sequencing tech-
nologies have allowed the understanding of the genetic
basis underlying some adaptive radiations (e.g. a beak
diversication locus in Darwin Finches) and have con-
rmed the role of hybridization and reshuing of alleles
into novel and favourable combinations that facilitate
the repeated exploration of ecological space (e.g. ex-
tended evolutionary synthesis). In parallel, progress in
ecological analysis, such as the determination of niche-
occupation (e.g. hypervolumes) has the potential to
clarify the role of ecology in driving repeated evolution
and the evolvability of phenotypes. These advances,
currently underway, still lack integration. To ll this
gap, we propose a symposium focusing on integrating
genomics, ecology, and phenotype, and specically ben-
eting from repeated evolution in adaptive radiations.
We will welcome contributions from diverse study sys-
tems, as well as multidisciplinary approaches including
various sources of data (genetics, morphology, ecology,
physiology).

Aug14-19
As part of the 2022 conference of the European Society
for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), we are organizing
Symposium S38, entitled:
*Molecular evolution and trade-os in host-pathogen
interactions and host immunity*
The ESEB conference will be held August 14-19 in
Prague
*Deadline for abstract submission is April 15*
Registration: https://www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-
abstracts-page Symposium abstract:
Host-pathogen interactions are considered one of the
major drivers for evolutionary change and maintenance
of genetic diversity. Host immune systems constantly
adapt to the rapidly evolving pathogens, utilising re-
ceptor variability and diverse and redundant eector
mechanisms to recognise and ght the wide range of
infecting agents. Thus, understanding the genotype-
phenotype interactions ensuring resistance is challenging.
Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly apparent that
the evolutionary trajectories of these immune systems
are not only shaped by parasites, but also constrained
by various immunological and metabolic trade-os or
the need to dierentiate self from non-self in order to
prevent autoimmunity. Dierent life-history strategies
of the host and uctuating environmental conditions,
including changes in parasite communities, might re-
quire dierent degrees of immune plasticity and immune
investment strategies. This symposium aims to bring
together theoretical concepts and empirical examples
highlighting these factors that shape the evolution of an
optimal immune response, considering immunogenetic,
cellular, metabolic, and ecological perspectives. We also
welcome examples of host-parasite interactions and re-
search in disease ecology inuencing the evolutionary
trajectory of host immunity. Our aim is to attract a
wide range of presentations that will allow discussion of
the main current challenges in the evolutionary research
of host immunity.

Dear colleagues,
The conference of the European Society for Evolutionary
Biology (ESEB) will be held in Prague, Czech Republic
14-19th of August. We invite abstracts to our sympo-
sium S28:
*Beyond transcription: the role of post-transcriptional
gene regulation in adaptation and evolution*
The selected presenters will be invited to contribute to
a Special Issue with the journal Heredity, edited by the
symposium organizers.
*Abstract submission is open until April 15th https://-
www.eseb2022.cz/en/call-for-abstracts-page* Sympo-
sium description: Gene expression regulation plays a
central role in adaptive divergence and evolution, yet
our understanding of adaptive post-transcriptional diver-
gence is in its infancy. Recent studies have demonstrated
the potentially important role of variation in alternativetranscript splicing and other post-transcriptional pro-
cesses in adaptation and evolution in several systems.
For example, multiple studies have shown the impor-
tant role of splicing dierences in encoding for discrete
adaptive phenotypes; many others have demonstrated
independent evolution in splicing and transcript abun-
dance, providing alternative paths for selection to act
upon. However, compared to transcription levels, many
questions remain e.g., regarding the role of variation
in transcript splicing under dierent eco-evolutionary
contexts, the rate of splicing versus expression evolution,
or the mechanisms through which splicing alters pheno-
types. We argue that now is the time for a symposium
on the role of post-transcriptional processes in adapta-
tion and evolution to set the path for future research.
The aim of this symposium is to synthesise our current
level of understanding on the role of post-transcriptional
variation in dierent eco-evolutionary contexts and di-
verse taxa, and highlight the role of novel analytical and
technological approaches, such as long-read sequenc-
ing, in driving our understanding of post-transcriptional
processing across the tree of life.
Keynote speakers: Dr. Alison Wright, University of
Sheeld, UK Dr. Manuel Irimia, Centre for Genomic
Regulation, Spain

EARLY BIRD REGISTRATION EXTENDED TO
APRIL 15 (THIS FRIDAY!) No limits on number of
individuals per lab
Dear Colleagues,
After a two-year absence, The TENTH annual Yosemite
Symbiosis Workshop will take place on May 13th-15th,18 EvolDir May 1, 2022
2022 at the Sierra Nevada Research Institute, Yosemite
National Park. We have really missed having this meet-
ing over the last two years. In the previous nine years,
this meeting became a great venue for a diversity of
symbiosis researchers. We hope to continue to attract a
diverse group in 2022!
Keynote speaker 2022: Michelle Nishiguchi, UC Merced
COVID19 Safety:
Attendees will be required to attest to full vaccination
status against SARS-CoV2 during the registration pro-
cess.
Rapid antigen tests will be made upon arrival at the
conference (provided by us) to provide an extra layer of
safety for attendees
The meeting will occur indoors, and masks will be re-
quired during meeting sessions when the opportunity
for social distancing will be limited.
Meals, and coee/snack breaks will be provided outside
weather permitting. Temperatures in mid-May are usu-
ally mild, but there is always some chance that it will
be cold and or rainy during the meeting.
Information about our meeting:
Why attend?
Our continuing goal is to better integrate the broad
groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis research.
Yosemite serves as an ideal site as it is both beautiful
and secluded. This will be our 10th annual meeting and
we have been consistently attracting scientists from all
over the country and overseas.
Who will be there?
The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants) and
we seek to focus on scientists interested in cooperation,
mutualism, and symbiosis. In the past we have covered a
range of symbiosis topics from ecology and evolution to
molecular mechanisms in dierent model and non-model
systems.We have removed restrictions on the number of individ-
uals per lab.
When is the meeting?
The talks and formal meeting will be held May 14th and
15th, 2022, though we make accommodation arrange-
ments available for attendees to arrive on Friday the
13th to provide opportunities to enjoy the park. There
will be a welcome party on the evening of arrival, Friday
May 13th. Since time at the conference is limited, we
ask attendees to submit an abstract and a preference
(talk versus poster). Priority will be given to those pre-
senting. Abstract and early bird registration will be due
on APRIL 15 2022.
Where is the meeting?
This is the best part! The meeting takes place at the
Sierra Nevada Research Station, in Wawona California,
within the border of Yosemite National Park!
What will it cost?

HaploidSexSpecicSelection
Applications are invited for a PhD fellow-
ship/scholarship at Graduate School of Natural
Sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark, within the
Computer Science programme. The position is available
from August 2022 or later.
Title: Haploid and sex-specic selection: modelling and
detection in deep mutational scanning of sperm samples
and trios
Research area and project description: Background:
Traditionally, population genetics models focus on se-
lection in the diploid phase. However, there is also in
principle ample potential for selection to occur during
the haploid phase both in female and male gametes. In
principle, haploid selection can be very eective rela-
tive to diploid where dominance often occurs and blurs
the eect of positive or negative selection. A few docu-
mented cases in animal plants and fungi attest to the
potential importance of haploid selection and theory
demonstrates that haploid selection is s neglected mech-
anism that can potentially aect rates of adaptation,
the magnitude and purging of inbreeding depression and
the load of deleterious mutations detected in genomes or
even provide a plausible explanation for sex dierences
in recombination rates (a ubiquitous nd that remains
poorly understood). However, empirically detecting
haploid selection is challenging.
Project: This project is a unique opportunity to do that:
we will generate deep mutational scanning datasets that
can also be leveraged to examine in detail how haploid se-
lection can aect both new variants but also pre-existing
variants (SNPs where the father is heterozygous). The
project is funded by the Novo Nordisk foundation as
an interdisciplinary Data Science collaborative project
between the Department of Growth and Reproduction
at Copenhagen University Hospital (Kristian Almstrup),
and Aarhus University with the department of Math-
ematics (Asger Hobolth), the department of Molecu-
lar Medecine (S >1
2ren Besenbacher & Lasse Marrety)
and the Bioinformatics Research Centre (Mikkel Heide
Schierup & Thomas Bataillon).
The candidate will work on developing new evolutionary
methods to analyze data from testes and sperm samples
as well as pre-existing trio data. The relative weight oftheoretical modeling, methods development and data
analysis will depend on the interests of the candidate.

of long-term changes in marine northern ecosystems,
especially within coastal environments. The aim is to
reconstruct whole ecosystem dynamics through time by
extracting sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) from
Arctic marine sediment cores.
Goals of the positions are
* Quantify the sensitivity of the sedaDNA method for
marine sediments. * Reconstruct past eukaryotic com-
munities from sediment cores. * Compare the past with
modern eukaryotic communities. * Establish new refer-
ence sequences for hitherto undescribed/unsequenced
species.
The modern-day data produced in this study will serve
as a reference point for the assessment of human im-
pact in coastal ecosystems in the future. Data will
be explored to include trait analyses and other prox-
ies, which will increase our understanding of dierent
environmental drivers on ecosystem development and
changes.

AuburnU EvolutionPlantParasites
I'm looking for a PhD or MS student to join my lab
at Auburn University and work on the evolution of
plant pests and pathogens. Our goal is to increase
the sustainability of agriculture by advancing our un-
derstanding of the evolution of two important traits:
resistance to pesticides, and virulence (that is, just how
harmful a parasite or pathogen is to its host). This
is a cross-disciplinary project and students will have
opportunities to participate in evolutionary modeling,
data science, and experimental research with bacterial
pathogens, their insect vectors, and some of their host
plants.
The position starts in August 2022, that is, the start of
the fall semester. It comes with a competitive twelve-
month stipend, health insurance, and a tuition waver.
Candidates who would add to the ethnic, gender, and
socioeconomic diversity of the academy are strongly
urged to apply. If you're interested, please send me an
email with your CV and any questions you might have
about the position before the end of April.

This project will suit a student with an interest in con-
servation genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics
The Lord Howe Island stick insect, thought to be ex-
tinct but recently rediscovered, has become emblematic
of the dangers faced by island species in the face of
anthropogenic change. A planned reintroduction eort
aims to rescue this species, one of the rarest insects
in the world, from the brink of extinction. Our aims
ar?e to explore the unique genome biology of this in-
sect, and use it as a model for adaptation to captivity
and to the post-release environment. Our project was
just funded for three years, and will build on the recent
development of numerous genomic resources, such as a
high-quality genome assembly. The project will com-
bine cutting-edge molecular techniques and innovative
approaches to genotyping of unusual material (historical
and non-destructively sampled in the eld) with analysis
of next-generation sequencing data. This project will
blend fundamental science investigating genome evolu-
tion with research outcomes that will directly contribute
to ongoing conservation eorts. Thus, skills obtained
during this degree will be relevant to academia, as well
as the conservation sector, including government and
NGOs.
Suitable applicants need to be highly motivated with
a strong academic and research background. Demon-
strated ability to conduct independent research is re-
quired, with experience in the molecular lab, and some
experience in programming or data analysis being de-

equivalent experience. The successful student will need
to apply to ANU for enrollment, for international ap-
plicants ideally by this year's April 15 deadline. The
successful applicant will receive a stipend scholarship
and research funds, including computer and travel fund-
ing.
Location: We will be based in the Division of Ecology
and Evolution at the Research School of Biology at the
Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.
The project will also be supported by Zoos Victoria,
who hold a large captive population of the LHI stick
insects at Melbourne Zoo, and are closely involved with
the recovery eort on Lord Howe Island. Field work to
collect additional samples is likely to be involved.Expression of interest: Expressions of interest should be
submitted directly to Alexander.Mikheyev@anu.edu.au.
International applicants should contact me by April 5,
2022, though the earlier the better so that we can co-
ordinate the ANU application due on the 15th. Please
include a brief statement on why you are interested in
this project, a CV and contact details for references.
Following assessment of applications one applicant will
then be invited to formally apply to the ANU. The

COLLABORATIONS AND NETWORKING The PhD
student will be able to interact with our network of
collaborators. Locally, strong interactions already ex-
ist with Veronique Decrooq & Quynh-Trang Bui (BFP,
INRAE Bordeaux). They work on the genomic bases
of adaptation and domestication in apricot trees and
share the same interest in SV and tree pan-genome
dynamics. Thus, a long term collaboration is ongoing.
The candidate will also collaborate with national ex-
perts in genome assemblies and annotations (Jean-Marc
Aury from G >1
2noscope, William Marande from CN-
RGV, INRAE URGI sta members), structural variation
analyses (Olivier Panaud, from Perpignan University),
comparative genomics and population genetics (within
the BIOGECO and BFP).
FULL SUMMARY WITH OBJECTIVES: Structural
variation (SV) - i.e. pieces of DNA being deleted, in-
serted, or rearranged among chromosomes - strongly
inuences gene content and genome structure within
and between closely related species. SV may have strong
impacts on phenotypes of ecological and agronomical
interest but are poorly captured when genotypes are
produced in comparison to one single reference genome.
Consequently, the evolutionary dynamics of SV in nat-
ural populations (mutation rate, role of selection in
shaping genetic variation) and their role in local adap-
tation remain poorly documented compared to that of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), especially in
forest tree species. Hence, in order to capture variation
of SV and its impact on phenotypic variation, compara-
tive and evolutionary genomics areas are now turning to
pan-genome based analyses of genetic variation. White
Oaks are species of ecological, economic and cultural
importance in Europe, accounting for a third of the
metropolitan French forests (i.e. 5M ha). These popu-May 1, 2022 EvolDir 25

biotic and abiotic stresses and their adaptive potential
in the context of climate changes is uncertain. The

Parasitism and social behaviour in ants
We invite applications for a fully funded PhD position
to work on the behavioural and chemical ecology of ne-
matode infections in ants with the groups of Yuko Ulrich
(ulrichlab.com) and Markus Knaden (ice.iwww.mpg.de/-
228656/odor-guided-behavior) at the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany.
Background: Parasites can aect virtually any aspect
of host biology, including behavior. Eects range from
manipulations of host behavior that increase parasite
transmission to changes in host social behaviour (e.g.,
social distancing) that reduce transmission. Social in-
sects and their parasites include some of the best-known
examples of behavioral eects at both ends of this spec-
trum (1, 2), but the mechanisms driving these changes
are rarely known.
Nematodes of the genus Diploscapter infect the postpha-
ryngeal gland of ants (3), an organ involved in the spread
of cuticular hydrocarbons among nestmates. Cuticu-
lar hydrocarbons play a central role in communication
within ant societies: they are the basis for the formation
of a \colony odor", which is in turn used for nestmate
recognition (i.e, self vs. non-self discrimination) (4). It
is currently unknown whether nematode infections in
the postpharyngeal gland can aect the ants' nestmate
discrimination ability, and if so, what the consequences
on aggressive behavior, colony composition, and parasite
transmission are.
Project Description: You will combine behavioural and
chemical analyses to study the eect of experimental
infections with Diploscapter nematodes in the clonal
raider ant Ooceraea biroi (5), an emerging model for
the study of social behaviour (6). You will investigate
whether and how nematodes aect ant cuticular hydro-
carbon proles and the ability of ants to discriminate
nestmates from non-nestmates, and how this in turn
aects the transmission success of the parasite and the
tness of host colonies. Depending on your interests, thisMay 1, 2022 EvolDir 29
project can develop to address more detailed questions
on the sensory and nutritional aspects of the interaction
between host and parasite, intergenerational eects of
infections on the host, or comparative approaches using
other ant-nematode species pairs. The project provides
opportunities for internal and external collaborations.
Candidate prole:
- Master's degree (or equivalent) in biology or related
eld
- Proactive, dynamic, and curious
- Excellent communication and organizational skills
- Prociency in written and spoken English
- Experience with behavioural assays or chemical analy-
ses in insects are desirable but not necessary
Applications should be submitted online through
the online portal of the graduate school (Interna-
tional Max Planck Research School, IMPRS): https:/-

ULausanne Two PlantEvolution
Two PhD positions in the Department of Ecology and
Evolution, University of Lausanne, Switzerland
1. Experimental evolution at species range margins 2.
Evolution of plant sexual systems
Two PhD position are open in John Pannell's lab in
the Department of Ecology and Evolution, University
of Lausanne, to study (1) the evolution of plant popu-
lations at and beyond species range margins or (2) the
evolution of plant sexual systems.
Further details about the lab, including recent pa-
pers on which this project will build, can be found at:
https://www.unil.ch/dee/pannell-group, or on writing
to john.pannell@unil.ch.
Project 1: Experimental evolution at species range mar-
gins This project will use experimental evolution to test
contrasting hypotheses for the eects of migration in
either promoting or hindering adaptation in marginal
populations. It will thus build on, and build bridges be-
tween, two strands in the lab: research on the demogra-
phy, evolution and genomics of species range expansions
and metapopulations; and the use of experimental evolu-
tion to address general questions in evolutionary biology.
The project will involve establishing experimental popu-
lations at a number of sites across Europe and following
their evolution over several successive generations, with
the aim of building three mutually informative datasets
to determine how admixture and selection in marginal
populations aect (1) their demography (and population
viability), (2) the quantitative genetics of morphological,
life-history and physiological traits with an inuence
on local adaptation in marginal environments, and (3)
the genomic architecture of responses to selection in
dierent environments and in the context of dierent
sources of admixture.
Project 2: Evolution of plant sexual systems The aim of
this project is to advance our understanding of sexual-
system transitions in plants, with a primary focus on
evolutionary transitions between hermaphroditism and
dioecy. The scope of the project can be partly tailored
to the particular interests of the successful applicant and
could involve a range of angles. We are currently par-
ticularly interested in using experimental evolution toaddress questions concerning the quantitative genetics
and genomic architecture of sexual-system transitions,
including but not only sex chromosomes. The student's
project could benet from involvement in conducting
and analysing results from an experimental evolution
study that has been running for more than a decade. It
could also include eld observations and experiments,
theoretical modelling and/or genomic analysis. There
is scope to choose from a number of dierent study
systems for empirical work.
Research scope and skills sought The student should
have broad interest in evolutionary biology and a foun-
dation in evolutionary biology, ecology and/or quantita-
tive/population genetics, with an interest in quantitative
and statistical analysis of large datasets. He/she should
also have good written and oral communication skills.
The project will involve close collaboration other lab
members and project partners across Europe, and the
successful candidate should thus both be self-motivated
and have a collaborative spirit. Although not a require-
ment (the language of the lab and the research environ-
ment of the department is English), some knowledge of
French would be an asset.
Host Department and University The Department of
Ecology and Evolution hosts a broad range of research
groups, and its members enjoy a lively intellectual and
social life. Although the University of Lausanne is fran-
cophone, the department is highly international, and
all its research activity and seminars are conducted in
English. The University has seven faculties and approx-
imately 14,300 students and 3,900 researchers from over
120 countries. It is situated on a beautiful campus on
the shore of Lake Geneva, and is close to the Swiss and
French Alps.
Starting dates Both project could start from September
2022, but the starting dates are exible and could po-
tentially brought forward or delayed to accommodate
the timing of an excellent candidate.
Applications Informal enquiries should be sent to John
Pannell (john.pannell@unil.ch). Formal applications for
both positions should be uploaded using the link below.
Applications should include (1) a cover letter detailing
your research interests, experience and motivation for
applying, (2) a CV, (3) an example of previous research
work (an article, preprint or master thesis chapter, and
(4) the names of two referees. All applications received
by the 15.05.2022 will receive full consideration.

UMontpellier RainForestEvolution
PhD position in spatial components of tropical rain
forest diversication, Montpellier, France
Project name: \Macroevolutionary determinants of An-
nonaceae species richness patterns"
Institutes and researchers involved: - Universit >1
2de
Montpellier (France) & IRD: Dr. Thomas Couvreur
- Maastricht University (The Netherlands): Dr. Roy
Erkens
Within the ERC funded GLOBAL project, we are seek-
ing a highly motivated student to undertake a PhD (3
years) on the evolutionary and spatial determinants of
Annonaceae species richness patterns across tropical
rain forests.
Research Area and Project Description: The ERC Con-
solidator project \GLOBAL" aims to unravel the evo-
lutionary history and diversication of tropical rain
forests (TRF) at a global scale. The project focuses
on the pantropical Annonaceae plant family, an impor-
tant component of TRF worldwide with around 2550
species. During the project we will sequence nearly
all species of the family. For each species, around 460
Annonaceae-specic exons and the angiosperm universal
exons (353) will be sequenced. This dataset will provide
one of the rst robust and near-complete phylogenies
of any major pantropical plant families to date. This
dataset will be used to test numerous TRF evolutionary
hypotheses at a global and local scales. GLOBAL is
highly collaborative with numerous collaborators from
across the globe, especially in tropical countries. This
will provide opportunities for the PhD to interact with
a wide range of researchers during the PhD.
The PhD will tackle questions related to the spatial as-
pects of Annonaceae evolution, testing major hypotheses
of tropical plant distribution at global (eg \odd man
out") and local scales (e.g. what determines diversity
at local levels?). The PhD student will have access to
the full Annonaceae phylogeny (+2000 species; which
will already be generated and dated), data on the dis-
tribution of Annonaceae globally (of which the studentwill contribute in building), and a large morphological
trait dataset.
Qualications and Specic Competences: The applicant
must have a recognized Master degree in evolution or
ecology (or equivalent). The candidate should demon-
strate a proven interest in evolutionary biology and/or
spatial analysis of biodiversity. Experience with tropical
biodiversity especially tropical rain forests is a plus. The
candidate must have a proven record in one or several of
the elds listed here: macroevolutionary diversication
analyses using dated phylogenetic trees; spatial anal-
yses of biodiversity (generate maps globally, estimate
species richness); inferring species distribution ranges
or species distribution modeling; experience in handling
large datasets.
In addition, the applicant should have a good knowledge
of programming languages such as R and/or Python (or
a strong will to learn/master such languages). Finally,
the student will have a good level of spoken and written
English and good communication skills. International
applicants who do not have English as their rst lan-
guage must prove strong English language writing skills
and uency. Knowledge of French is a plus, but not
mandatory. The candidate should also have excellent
organizational and communication skills.
Place of Employment and Work: The student will
be based at the \Institut de Recherche pour le
D >1
2veloppement" (IRD), UMR DIADE, DYNADIV
team, 911 Avenue Agropolis, Montpellier, France. Mont-
pellier is a pleasant Mediterranean town with a vibrant
and internationally recognized research community, es-
pecially in evolutionary biology (University of Mont-
pellier). The successful candidate will be enrolled at
the Universit >1
2de Montpellier (France) for the PhD
diploma.
Start date: The position needs to start by October 1st
2022 at the latest.
Application deadline: May 16th 2022 (23.59 Paris time).
You will receive an automatic response when you sub-
mit your application. If you do not, please email the
application again.

multi-disciplinary at the border of several elds: pop-
ulation genetics, ecology, statistics and computer sci-
ence. Minimal knowledge of all these elds and in-depth
knowledge in one or more of them is expected. An im-
portant part of the project will involve the simulation of
population genomics data and the analysis of these sim-
ulations. A strong taste for computational approachesand programming is therefore required (C++, R).
We are therefore looking for a candidate who is highly
motivated by methodological developments in popula-
tion genetics/genomics, with a master's degree in evolu-
tionary biology, bio-statistics or mathematical comput-
ing, and a strong interest in evolutionary biology and
ecology.
The student will benet from an extremely favorable
work environment within the CBGP, the Montpellier
scientic community, and the DevOCGen project (more
than 20 researchers in 11 UMR, 6 bioinformatics and
sequencing platforms, and 4 non-permanent funded re-
searchers).
Interested applicants should send their CV and a half-

Short summary of the proposed thesis topic:
*New developments for inferring local and recent popula-
tion demographics from genomic data and applications
for the management of threatened populations and or-
ganisms of agronomic interest.*
The development of agro-ecological approaches for the
management of pests and benecials, as well as their vec-
tors and antagonists, requires a better understanding of
the local demographic functioning of their populations.
Similarly, the management of threatened populations
requires a detailed knowledge of the demographic and
genetic status of these populations: population sizes,
fragmentation, dispersal, inbreeding... Among the key
factors to characterize, population densities/sizes and
dispersal abilities, at a small geographical scale, as well
as their variations over the recent past, are often poorly
known but crucial to better understand the dynamics
of these populations. Spatialized genomic data contain
information on these demographic parameters, but cur-
rent analysis methods do not allow for the use of all this
information. Furthermore, the resulting demographic
estimates often involve large spatial and temporal scales
of limited practical interest. The goal of this project
is to ll this methodological gap, by developing newMay 1, 2022 EvolDir 35
tools for estimating local demographic parameters, as
well as their recent variations, from genomic data using
spatialized demo-genetic models. In continuation of our
current work on spatialized population genetic mod-
els and the development of simulation-based inference
methods, the PhD student will focus on: (1) implement
temporal changes of demographic parameters in our
spatialized genomic simulator GSpace; (2) develop a set
of new statistics summarizing the genomic information
relevant for the inference of the parameters of interest;
(3) couple them to powerful simulation-based inference
methods; (4) test the level of spatio-temporal complex-
ity that can be considered depending on the type and
amount of data available. In order to validate their
practical interest, these developments will be thought,
tested and applied in two quite dierent contexts: (1)

earliest possible date. We are oering a xed-term posi-
tion (65%) for 3 years.
Your tasks:
The position is part of the Collaborative Research Cen-
tre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled: A Novel Synthesis of Indi-
vidualisation across Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution:
Niche Choice, Niche Conformance, Niche Construction
(NC3), as granted by the German Research Foundation
(DFG).
This PhD project deals with the ecological and evolu-
tionary eects of parasite virulence. In this project,
you will investigate the niche construction eects of
a trophically transmitted tapeworm parasite (Schisto-
cephalus solidus) on individual three-spined stickleback
sh. The project aims to show how these eects cascadefrom the individual to the ecosystem level and alter
eco-evolutionary dynamics. The successful candidate
will be involved in mesocosm experiments to investi-
gate how parasite virulence aects individual trophic
specialisation of the hosts. We also aim to identify
the physiological and metabolic traits associated with
these individual dierences. The successful candidate
will further take advantage of transcriptomic datasets
to identify the immuno-physiological traits associated
with host niche individualisation, and contribute to the
development of computational models that will bridge
the gap between individual, population, and community
processes.
Our expectations:
Applicants should be highly motivated scientists of any
nationality, who are interested in interdisciplinary work.
They should have the equivalent of a master degree in
biology, preferentially with a focus on evolution and
ecology, or related elds. A background, and ideally
some experience, in any of the following areas will be
useful: sh handling and care, limnology, molecular
skills, individual-based models, as well as a good under-
standing of statistics. Applicants should have excellent
communication skills and be able to work both inde-
pendently and as part of a multidisciplinary team. The
working language of the Institute and the lab is English,
and good prociency in spoken and written English is a
requirement.

of topics in evolutionary ecology and genetics.
Project: I'm looking for motivated PhD candidates to
investigate how parental age and environment aect
ospring development and tness. Two positions are
available.
Despite over a century of research on the biology of age-May 1, 2022 EvolDir 37
ing, one intriguing aspect of ageing - the widely observed
tendency for older parents to produce ospring with re-
duced lifespan and tness - remains poorly understood.
Such eects could be a major source of variation in
individual tness, and could play a role in the evolution
of ageing. Building on recent work by the Bonduriansky
lab and others, this research will address the mecha-
nisms mediating these eects, the roles of mothers vs.
fathers, and the role of the ambient environment. This
project will also contribute new theory on the evolution-
ary implications of such eects.
Applicants should be highly motivated, and should have
a strong academic background (including writing and
quantitative skills) and previous research experience
(preferably including publications). PhD students in
the Bonduriansky lab are expected to play a central
role in developing their projects, and to be able to work
independently on their research.
Both domestic and international students are eligible for
these PhD positions. If interested, please send an email
to Russell Bonduriansky (r.bonduriansky@unsw.edu.au)
outlining your qualications and why you are interested
in this project. Please include a CV and contact details

GenomicFishSexDetermination
A PhD position on \Genetic/Genomic basis of sex de-
termination in sh of aquaculture interest" is available
at the Doctoral Course in Veterinary Science (Padua
University).
Apply by May 13, 2022 Information about
the application can be found at https://-
www.dottorato.veterinaria.unipd.it/enrollment
Start date: Oct 2022
GENETIC/GENOMIC BASIS OF SEX DETERMI-
NATION IN FISH OF AQUACOLTURE INTEREST
In teleost sh, sex determination mechanisms are
extremely diverse ranging from the presence of evi-
dent heterochromatic sex chromosomes to simultane-
ous hermaphroditism. When genetic sex determination
(GSD) is observed the underlying mechanisms might be
diverse even between closely related species or within the
same species. In several sh species of aquaculture inter-
est, it would be of great benet to have tools that allow
sex identication during early developmental stages. It
is the case of the athead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus),
whose roe is a highly sought seafood consisting of raw
or dried female gonads. In some Mediterranean areas
it represents an important product for the local econ-
omy. Genetic markers at the FSHR (follicle-stimulating
hormone receptor) gene were recently identied in M.c.
by means of whole-genome sequencing (Ferraresso et
al., 2021). However, genetic screening of natural pop-
ulations from dierent geographic origins showed an
incomplete penetrance of this character underling the
possibility that also other genetic and non-genetic (envi-
ronmental) factors may play a role in sex-determination
of M.c. The project has 5 lines of possible development:
1) Genomic scan searching for additional markers of sex
determination in M.c.; 2) Application of the existing
markers for sex sorting in early sh developmental stages
aimed at raring only female individuals for \bottarga"
production; 3) Genotype-assisted individual breeding in
order to maximize the percentage of female ospring;
4) Extension of the population analysis to gain a wider
geographic picture of the penetrance of the FSHR sex-
associated markers; 5) Extension of the genetic/genomicstudy to other mullet species (i.e. Liza spp.) that are
relevant for \bottarga" production.

ROLE OF TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS IN FRUIT
TREES IN RESPONSE TO BIOTIC STRESS, deadline
for application : 29 April 2022
We are seeking candidates for a PhD to joint
the Cornille?s Lab (ECLECTIC group?: http://-
moulon.inrae.fr/en/equipes/eclectic/) working on the
genomics and ecology of fruit tree-pest interactions at
the laboratoire G?n?tique Quantitative et Evolution-Le
Moulon at the Institut Diversit? ?cologie et ?volution du
Vivant (https://www.ideev.universite-paris-saclay.fr/-
en/) at Universit? Paris Saclay (https://www.universite-
paris-saclay.fr/en Ile-de-France, France) within the ANR40 EvolDir May 1, 2022
PLEASURE project (https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-
CE20-0005).
Keywords: adaptation, fruit trees, epigenomics - methy-
lation, gene expression, evolution, pests?
Objectifs The aim of the PhD project is to investigate
the eect of TE insertion on gene expression in response
to biotic stress in fruit trees, using a population genomics
lens. To that aim, the PhD candidate will undertake a
rigorous analysis of the impact of TE insertion polymor-
phism on gene expression in crop and wild populations
of an emblematic fruit tree, the apple tree, for which
a very large amount of genomic data is available. The
PhD project is structured into two interconnected ques-
tions, that will be subsequently Investigated, which rely
on exposure of crop and wild apple populations to pest
attack and the investigation of the involvement of TEs
in this stress response: 1) What is the eect of TE
insertion on gene expression in response to biotic stress
in a context of fruit tree domestication? 2) What is the
impact of DNA methylation variants in TE repression in
response to biotic stress in the context of fruit tree do-
mestication? ? M?thods -populations genomics of trans-
posable elements; -epigenomics (methylation marks);
-bioinformatics (scripting in perl/python/shell, access
to informatics clusters); -experiments in controlled con-
ditions (aphid rearing, apple culture) -molecular biology
(RNA and DNA extraction).
Prole and skills required? Knowledge in 1) evolution-
ary biology and population genomics is required (in
gene expression analyses or on transposable elements
evolution will be a plus) and 2) bioinformatics (writing
scripts, e.g., in perl/python/R/shell, access to comput-
ing clusters). Knowledge of 3) epigenomics will be a
plus. The candidate should not necessarily be familiar
with tree or insect models.

ExperimentalEvolution
PhD Scholarship: The costs and consequences of antimi-
crobial resistance in microbial communities
Applicants are invited for a fully funded PhD position
in the group of Dr Andrew Letten at the University of
Queensland to study resource competition and antimi-
crobial resistance evolution in microbial communities.
Background: Ecological theory provides a powerful
framework for understanding the competitive balance
between sensitive and resistant bacteria, and therefore
the evolution of resistance (Letten et al, 2021 Nature
Eco Evo). The primary goal of this ARC funded project
is to go beyond the theory and test how well we can pre-
dict the evolution and persistence of resistant bacteria
in microbial communities under the highly variable envi-
ronmental conditions typical of most microbial systems
(from soils and water to the gut). This is critical not
only for our fundamental understanding of microbial
competition and evolution, but also ultimately for the
identication and development of new ecologically-awarestrategies for managing resistance.
A wide variety of investigatory approaches fall within the
scope of the project including high throughput screening
and competition assays, molecular work, mathematical
modelling, and computer simulations. The PhD student
will have ample room to take the project in a more
experimental or computational/theoretical direction de-
pending on their interests and background. This is to
say that highly motivated students that are primarily
interested, or have a strong background, in either em-
pirical or computational/theoretical research are both
encouraged to apply. Similarly, the project is suitable
to students coming from a microbiology or molecular
background interested in ecological and evolutionary
research, or those coming from an ecological or evolu-
tionary background who are interested in bringing their
knowledge to microbial systems.
A working knowledge of laboratory research, experimen-
tal evolution and/or mathematical modelling would be
of benet to someone working on this project. The
applicant will demonstrate academic achievement in the
eld(s) of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology
or molecular biology and the potential for scholastic
success. A background or knowledge of R or Python
programming and ecological and/or evolutionary theory
is highly desirable.
The student will be based in the School of Biological
Sciences at The University of Queensland, Brisbane,
Australia. We are a research-intensive University and
our School comprises more than 100 academic and post-
doctoral research sta, and ~200 higher-degree research
students. The student and project will benet from
the School's formidable research expertise in ecology,
evolutionary biology and genetics, physiology, and math-
ematical, statistical and computational biology.
As a scholarship recipient, you'll receive:
- Living stipend of $28,854 per annum tax free (2022
rate), indexed annually - Tuition fees covered - Single
Overseas Student Health Cover (international appli-
cants)
Please contact Dr Andrew Letten (a.letten@uq.edu.au)
as soon as possible if you are interested (including a CV
and a brief statement on your research background and
interests). More information on the recruitment process

UToronto Fishgenetics
Genetics of Endangered and Invasive Freshwater Fishes
in the Great Lakes Basin, University of Toronto
The Lovejoy and Mandrak labs (mandraklab.ca) have
an opening for an MSc or PhD student for September
2022.
Diet overlap analysis is a conventional method for evalu-
ating potential competition. Such analyses are typically
undertaken by sacricing sh and dissecting their stom-
achs to determine the contents. A common non-lethal
method is to wash the stomach contents out through
the mouth using gastric lavage. However, a major short-
coming of both methods is that it is often dicult to
identify stomach contents owing to gastric acid break-
down, particularly if the prey does not have resistant
body parts (e.g. exoskeletons). Recent advances of
genetic methods suggest that stomach contents can be
identied to species using a genetic metabarcoding ap-
proach (Mychek-Londer et al. 2020). The student will
further develop and conduct stomach contents DNA and
eDNA analyses to determine the diet of invasive and
endangered sh species. The project includes Indige-
nous, provincial, and federal partners and is funded by
GEN-FISH (gen-sh.ca). The successful candidate could
also apply to the FishCAST NSERC Create program
(shcast.ca).
Candidates should have genetics laboratory experience,
excellent written and oral communication skills, quanti-
tative skills, and other relevant skills. The student will
be enrolled in the graduate Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology (MSc) or Department of Physical
and Environmental Sciences (PhD) and be based at the
University of Toronto Scarborough.
The University of Toronto is strongly committed to di-
versity within its community and especially welcomes
applications from racialized persons / persons of colour,
women, Indigenous / Aboriginal People of North Amer-
ica, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2S+ persons, and
others who may contribute to the further diversication
of ideas.
The University strives to be an equitable and inclusive
community, and proactively seeks to increase diversity
among its community members. Our values regardingequity and diversity are linked with our unwavering com-
mitment to excellence in the pursuit of our academic
mission.

UtrechtU FungusInsectInteractions
UTRECHT UNIVERSITY. PHD POSITION FUNGUS-
INSECT INTERACTIONS
Job description Infected animals often behave dier-
ently from healthy animals. These changes can involve
precise manipulations caused by parasites to increase
that parasite's chances to spread. How exactly ma-
nipulative parasites can alter host behaviour is largely
unknown. Uncovering the parasite compounds and host
pathways involved could have both medical and agri-
cultural applications through the discovery of novel
drugs and holistic methods to battle insect pests. The
behaviourally tractable \zombie ant system" has the
potential to expose the mechanisms underlying parasitic
behavioural manipulation and fundamentally transform
perceptions of parasite-host interactions and their be-
havioural ecology eects. Our research group uses these
fungus-infected \zombie ants" as a model to study dis-
ease progression, related behavioural phenotypes, and
the mechanisms underlying those phenotypes. We love
to push the boundaries when it comes to available tech-
niques for this novel model system, so we often nd
ourselves adopting and creating new tools to answer our
research questions.
The nature of the research that you will be involved
in is naturally integrative. As such, your work will
involve a variety of tasks spanning the elds of molec-
ular microbiology, genetics, genomics, and behavioural
ecology:
- Apply gene-editing and other molecular microbiol-
ogy and genetics technology to study the function of
candidate manipulation compounds. - Produce and
analyse genomics and transcriptomics datasets to re-
veal host pathways involved in altered behaviours. -
Conduct infection and compound exposure experiments
with a variety of invertebrate host organisms ranging44 EvolDir May 1, 2022
from established model systems to ant colonies collected
from nature. - Use quantitative behavioural tracking
software and conducting statistical analyses to study
disease-related behavioural phenotypes. - Participate
in yearly eld expeditions to Florida (USA) to collect
carpenter ant colonies.
Qualications
You t well within our research team when you are
ambitious, creative, and highly motivated. Next to that,
you have a strong interest in parasite-host interactions,
fungal biology and/or insect behaviour. It works in
your favour if you have already developed good working
knowledge in experimental design and statistics.
We would also like you to bring the following:
- a Master's degree with a background in molecular bi-
ology, genetics, microbiology or a related eld; - prior
experience with genomics or transcriptomics data gener-
ation and analysis (ideally, but not necessary); - prior ex-
perience with insect handling, collecting and husbandry
(ideally, but not necessary, at the very least you are not

SkinkPhylogenetics
Fully funded PhD to study the \Phylogenetic relation-
ships and biogeography of the sphenomorphin skinks"May 1, 2022 EvolDir 45
Based at the University of Wolverhampton, UK. Appli-
cation deadline is 29th April 2022. Open to UK and
International applicants. The position comes with an
annual salary of GBP15,608 + tuition fees+ research
expenses.
Skinks are the most diverse family of reptile, comprising
a quarter of all lizard species: 7-9 subfamilies/tribes, 168
genera and ca. 1,744 species. Of these, over a third of
all species, in 32 genera, belong to the tribe Sphenomor-
phini (formally in the subfamily Sphenomorphinae sensu
Shea, 2021 Zootaxa, 5067(3), 301-351). Despite this high
diversity, internal evolutionary relationships within the
Sphenomorphini have remained poorly studied and may
not form a true (monophyletic) taxonomic group. The
sphenomorphin skinks have a wide geographic distribu-
tion spanning major biogeographic barriers, occurring
across Asia, Australasia and the Americas.
Western Melanesia including New Guinea sits at the
crossroads of Asia, Australia, and the Pacic and is
one of the most interesting, puzzling, and understudied
hyperdiverse regions on Earth. Despite being highly
diverse, most taxonomic groups have lacked research
focus. The sphenomorphin skinks of Western Melanesia
occupy a substantial proportion of the region's lizard
diversity but little is still known about them. Nine
genera of sphenomorphin skinks are known to occur
in the Western Melanesian region (Alpinoscincus, Fo-
jia, Glaphyromorphus, Nubeoscincus, Ornithuroscincus,
Palaia, Papuascincus, Prasinohaema, Sphenomorphus)
yet the number of species within these genera are known
to be underestimated and their relationships largely
unknown. This PhD project aims to provide a bet-
ter understanding of the evolutionary relationships and
historical biogeographic patterns among the sphenomor-
phin skinks, using cutting edge molecular approaches.
The project aligns with Dr Simon Maddock (University
of Wolverhampton, UK) and Dr Fred Kraus' (University
of Michigan, USA) recently funded NERC-NSF grant,
\Origins and expansion of endemic biodiversity in west-
ern Melanesia and their relation to tectonic evolution",
and it is expected that the successful applicant will
develop (alongside collaborators) additional research
questions relating to the origins of Western Melanesian
sphenomorphin skinks, following the generation of initial
results and the applicant's interests.
With the onset of high-throughput sequencing meth-
ods, previously unavailable molecular data are now
accessible from museum specimens with recently de-
veloped archival DNA methods. These advance-
ments enable us to address questions relating to
poorly sampled taxa, and the PhD project will ex-
ploit this by generating novel sequence data for mi-tochondrial DNA and ultraconserved elements (UCEs)
(https://www.ultraconserved.org <http://%28https//-
www.ultraconserved.org >/) from historic museum sam-
ples as well as freshly collected samples. The PhD
project will primarily be genetics based, however, it will
also provide the successful applicant with the opportu-
nity to undertake some eldwork to collect sphenomor-
phin DNA samples (and specimens).
The successful applicant will be based at the University
of Wolverhampton, UK, which boasts excellent labo-
ratory facilities and has recently received an internal
1million research investment fund for bioscience research.
The successful candidate will be expected to work closely
with the postdoctoral researcher, the research assistant,
and other project partners on Maddock and Kraus' joint
NERC-NSF grant. The ideal candidate should have an
interest in evolutionary biology and ideally be willing
to undertake eldwork in a challenging environment
(provisionally Papua New Guinea). Additionally, the
candidate should be reliable, patient, enthusiastic, com-
mitted to scientic research, able to work both as part of
a team and individually and they should show sensitivity
and adaptability to foreign cultures. Candidates with
prior lab and eld experience will have an advantage.
The project would benet from independent direction
by the successful candidate depending on their interests
and preliminary results.
The supervisory team will be led by Simon Maddock
(University of Wolverhampton, UK) and will be co-
supervised by Fred Kraus (University of Michigan, USA).
Informal and formal enquiries should be directed to Si-
mon Maddock (s.maddock@wlv.ac.uk). Interviews will
be scheduled for the week commencing 6th June 2022.
The PhD candidate will be encouraged to apply for
additional funding to support eld and museum work
(with Dr Maddock's support) to cover any additional
costs
Specic requirements of applicants: >A rst or upper
second-class honours degree in biology or zoology, or a

WSL Switzerland TreeAdaptation
WSL.Switzerland.AdaptationGenomicsForestTrees
The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Land-
scape Research WSL is part of the ETH Domain. Ap-
proximately 600 people work on the sustainable use and
protection of the environment and on the handling of
natural hazards.
The Research Unit Biodiversity and Conservation Bi-
ology studies the impact of the environment and land
use on the diversity of life. In the framework of the
ERC Consolidator Grant, MyGardenOfTrees, the Evo-
lutionary Genetics Group (https://sites.google.com/-
view/evolgenetgroup) oers for the duration of 3-years
starting as soon as possible a position for a PhD Student
in \Adaptation during range expansion in European
beech. The Evolutionary Genetics Group is interested
in understanding the roles of demography and natural
selection in shaping the life-histories and the genetic com-
position of forest tree populations across the landscape.
The group uses eld experiments, statistical models,
and individual-based computer simulations to answer
fundamental evolutionary questions and to aid adap-
tive forest management decisions. MyGardenOfTrees
(https://www.mygardenoftrees.eu/) is establishing an
unprecedented species range-wide transplant experiment
to assess the capacity of growth and regeneration of two
forest tree species, European beech and silver r, as
well as their Mediterranean and oriental sister species.
The experimental part of the project is based on partic-
ipatory science and involves foresters all across Europe.
Two PhD students will be engaged on this project work-ing on complementary topics.
The current PhD position will focus on understanding
the adaptive and demographic processes that have led to
the range expansion of European beech (Fagus sylvatica
L.) after the last glacial maximum. Fagus sylvatica is
best considered as a species complex whose current range
extends from Spain to northern Iran. Despite the large
genetic diversity of beech populations in Minor Asia and
on the Balkan peninsula, a single lineage has colonized
most of Europe. Did the colonizing lineage have superior
performance, and does it outperform other lineages still
today? Could current beech die-back across Europe be
partly attributed to the reduced genetic diversity due
to the expansion load beyond ongoing unprecedented
climate change? Could the introduction of other beech
lineages and hybridization between them be used to
adapt European beech forests to future climate change?
The selected PhD student will investigate these ques-
tions using a combination of genomics (whole genome
sequence data), common garden experiments (performed
by foresters) and environmental data. The PhD project
will involve roughly 15% eld and lab work, 50% data
analysis (and simulations), and 35% dissemination and
thesis writing.
The ideal candidate holds a Masters degree in evolution-
ary biology, population genetics, bioinformatics, plant
science or in a related discipline and has a keen interest
in evolutionary biology, statistics and bioinformatics.
Advanced knowledge in R and/or python are necessary
and interests in database management is a plus. We are
looking for a person who is motivated to pursue a scien-
tic career and who is curious, creative, responsible and
can work independently. Fluency in English and excel-
lent written and oral communication skills are expected.
The PhD thesis will be supervised by Dr Katalin Csill ery
(WSL, leader of the Evolutionary Genetics Group), Prof
Dr Yvonne Willi (University of Basel), Dr Christoph
Sperisen (WSL), and will be in collaboration with the
Genetic Diversity Center of the ETH Zurich. The PhD
student will be based at WSL in Birmensdorf with short
stays at the University of Basel. The PhD degree will be
awarded by the University of Basel and the Zurich-Basel
Plant Science Center's PhD program in Plant science.
Applications, including a motivation letter, a sum-
mary of past relevant accomplishments, a CV, and the
names and contact details of two referees should be
sent to Mich ele Bucher, Human Resources WSL, by
uploading the requested documents through the WSL

CnidarianEvolution
Research Technician in the Babonis Lab at Cornell Uni-
versity
In the Babonis Lab, we use the dynamic processes of em-
bryogenesis and tissue morphogenesis to understand how
novel traits arise. We seek to hire a highly motivated
junior research technician (postbac) and a senior techni-
cian (lab manager) to work in a research lab dedicated
to studying the cellular, molecular, and developmental
biology of cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, jellysh).
Primary responsibilities for the technicians will be to
support ongoing research in the lab and to overseemaintenance of the animal colony (sea anemones, tube
anemones, and corals). Animal maintenance includes
preparing seawater, maintaining animal-safe conditions,
cleaning animal dishes, feeding/preparing adults for
spawning, and caring for embryos. This portion of the
research requires the ability to carry 5 gallons of water
(~40 lbs) over short distances. The technicians will also
assist in the generation and phenotypic analysis of mu-
tations produced by genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9) in
sea anemones. Analyses associated with this research
include extracting genomic DNA, performing PCR and
gel electrophoresis, molecular cloning, and basic DNA
sequence analysis. The technicians will analyze phe-
notypes in wildtype and mutant animals using in situ
hybridization, immunouorescence, and RNA extrac-
tion for quantitative PCR. Many of these techniques
will require the use of microscopy (light, confocal, and
electron microscopy). An additional portion of the work
will involve general lab maintenance, including: order-
ing and organization of consumables, assisting in the
training of incoming students and postdocs in relevant
techniques, and summarizing data, preparing gures,
and reporting results at lab meetings. Specic duties
will be coincident with experience.
Both positions are full-time (39 hrs/wk), one-year ap-
pointments with the possibility of extension annually
based on continued available funding and successful
work performance. Review of applications will begin
May 1, 2022 and the positions will remain open until
lled.

that have become newly suitable. To better understand
this process, our team will be travelling to Norway and
Finland in summer 2022 to conduct latitudinal sampling
transects of the rapidly-range expanding insect species,
the blue-tailed damsely (Ischnura elegans). FieldworkMay 1, 2022 EvolDir 61

UAmsterdam EvolutionaryEcology
At the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dy-
namics (IBED), University of Amsterdam, we seek to
appoint an early career assistant professor for a tenure
track in the area of Evolutionary Ecology in rapidly
changing environments.
At IBED, we investigate how species relationships de-
termine the structure and stability of biological com-
munities, and how the integrity of these communities is
inuenced or compromised by processes such as species
extinction, the introduction of non-native invaders, and
the growth of harmful species. Within EPB, our re-
search comprises fundamental and applied investigations
at the level of individual variation, population genetics
and community dynamics, to understand the process
of speciation, the evolution of resistance, the evolution
of endangered and invasive species, and evolution in
the face of climate change. Specically, we are working
on evolutionary questions related to plant communities,
plant-herbivore, herbivore-herbivore, predator-herbivore
and host-pathogen interactions, both within and be-
tween species.
We are looking for candidates that can complement the
research program of the department of Evolutionary
and Population Biology (EPB, seehttps://ibed.uva.nl/-
content/research-departments/epb/epb.html) at IBED,
that covers a broad range of topics related to theeco-evolutionary dynamics of species interactions in
challenging environments.The ideal candidate will also
strengthen collaborations between existing research lines
within EPB as well as within IBED, and link funda-
mental research on evolutionary ecology with applied
areas such as (urban) planning, nature conservation or
pest management and values public engagement and
outreach.
As for education, the EPB Department is involved in the
educational programs of the BSc-programs (i) Biology
and (ii) Future Planet Studies, and the MSc-programs (i)
Ecology and Evolution and (ii) Future Planet Ecosystem
Science, and teaches courses in the elds of behavioral
and physiological biology, (eld) ecology, neurobiology
and evolutionary biology, among others.

Evolution meetings - Assistant Meeting Ocer
The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), on behalf
of the Joint ASN/SSB/SSE council, seeks a member of
one or more of our societies to help plan and run our
annual scientic conference - the Evolution meetings
(https://www.evolutionmeetings.org). The meetings are
coordinated by a Chief Meeting Ocer (CMO), an aca-
demic who oversees all aspects of the meeting and who is
responsible for nal decisions about schedules, activities
and venues, in consultation with a tri-society Joint Meet-
ing Committee (JMC) and the larger ASN/SSB/SSE
Joint Council. The CMO also acts as the principal liai-
son with a Professional Conference Organizer (PCO),
whose responsibilities include executing the logistics of
conference management, interactions with vendors and
service providers, and helping identify and negotiate
contracts with future meeting venues. Joint CMOs are
also possible.
We are currently seeking an Assistant Meeting Ocer
who will help the CMO(s) with organization, including
interfacing with society councils and other stakehold-
ers, producing the scientic program, and providingacademic insight to help guide the work of the PCO.
Specic duties will be determined by the CMO and
the JMC, in consultation with the AMO. Assistants
normally serve a 3-year term and, if interested, may
transition into the lead CMO role at some point, with
approval of the JMC. Helping run our meetings is an
important and valuable service to our societies and our
eld which is largely a volunteer eort, but the AMO
will be given a stipend of $5000/year in appreciation.
All meeting attendance costs will also be covered, as well
as any other costs associated with carrying out meeting
responsibilities.
The time commitment is variable but is expected to
average a few hours/week, ramping up at certain times
depending on particular tasks and in the month preced-
ing the meeting. Much of the time is spent in electronic
communication and virtual meetings, but there are also
some duties at the conference.
This position is best suited to someone who has at-
tended several of our recent meetings, has academic
organizational and leadership experience, enjoys team-
work, and would nd it rewarding to serve the societies
by fostering dynamic and high-quality meetings. We
welcome expressions of interest; please email these to
mailto:evolution.meetings@gmail.com with 'AMO posi-
tion' in the subject and include any relevant experience
and a CV. These will be reviewed on a rolling basis with
the goal of lling this position by summer 2022, with
working starting then on the 2023 meeting (to be held70 EvolDir May 1, 2022
in Albuquerque, NM from June 21-15). There are no
geographic restrictions, nor citizenship or residency re-
quirements, but attendance at the 2023 and subsequent
meetings is expected and in-person attendance at the
2022 meeting would be an asset.
About the annual conference: The Evolution meeting
is the joint conference of the American Society of Nat-
uralists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, and
the Society of Systematic Biologists. The conference
is held in a dierent location every year, primarily in
the United States but occasionally in other countries.
Recent and future locations include Portland OR, Prov-
idence RI, Cleveland OH, and Albuquerque NM. The
meeting is the premier opportunity for sharing research
on evolutionary biology. The conference attracts be-
tween 1500-2000 attendees and includes more than 1,000
oral presentations, 400-500 posters, a diverse array of
social events, and a variety of workshops. It runs for
approximately 5 days (depending on satellite events) in
mid-late June. Evolution 2022 will be our rst hybrid
meeting, with options for virtual and in-person partici-
pation, and we anticipate this continuing in future years.
Evolution has an enforced meeting Code of Conduct and
a strong commitment to promoting equity and inclusion.
More information is available on the conference web site:
http://www.evolutionmeetings.org, including complete
programs from recent meetings. Conferences are run
on a break-even basis with careful attention given to
minimizing registration costs for attendees.

DonalHickey HasPassed
Donal Hickey passed on April 7th after a short battle
with cancer.
Donal has always been a good, true and loyal friend to
me ever since I started o at the University of Alberta as
a young PhD student. Donal, after completing his PhD
with Dick Lewontin, started o his career at Brock Uni-
versity, then moved on to the University of Ottawa and
then Concordia University. Ever since I have known him
he was a friend and a mentor to all that knew him. He
was a valued member of the Genetics Society of Canada
and served as its President. He published regularly in a
career that spanned almost 50 years.
I still use his simple and clear explanation of how trans-
posable elements can be deleterious and yet still spread
in a population in my undergraduate classes. This ex-
planation will now be tinged with fond memories of a
great scholar.

SMBE IDEA ProposalCall
SMBE IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access)
2022 Proposal Call
SMBE, through the IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity
and Access) task force, aims to address all forms of
exclusion in our society. With this in mind, a budget of
up to $25,000 per year will be dedicated to initiatives
that help reduce inequities in molecular biology and
evolution research. The task force would therefore like
to invite members of SMBE to propose initiatives that
would take place in the year 2022/2023. Examples of ini-
tiatives could include, but are not limited to, workshops,
symposia, training opportunities, stand-alone featured
talks, or inequity data collection in particular groups,
countries, or regions (to name a few).
Guidelines and instructions for proposals
- At least one of the organizers must be a member of
SMBE. Please note that you can apply for a comple-
mentary SMBE membership by contacting the SMBE
council.
- A short description (between half and one full page)
of the proposed idea should be submitted by email to
smbe.contact@gmail.com for review by 16th May 2022.
This is the initial submission. Submissions should ad-
dress how the proposal will help advance the goals of
the SMBE IDEA task force.
- The initial submission should include the names and
full contact information of all organizers and involved
institutions. Universities/organizations providing ad-
ditional nancial support, if involved, should also be
listed.
- Initial submissions will be reviewed and pre-selected by
the IDEA task force, and candidates will be notied with
a decision within 3 weeks after the initial submission
deadline (by 6th June).
- If the initial submission is selected, organizers are
expected to submit a full project plan by email to
smbe.contact@gmail.com by 25th July 2022. This must
include a budget and time plan, as well as relevance and
expected short and long-term impacts of the initiative
on inclusion, diversity, equity and/or inclusion. The
IDEA task force commits to aiding organizers during
the development of the project plan.
- Successful proposals will be notied by 15th August2022.

PlantCyanobacteriaSymbiosis
The Fay-Wei Li lab (fernway.net) at Boyce Thompson
Institute & Cornell University is looking for two postdoc-
toral researchers to work on bryophyte-cyanobacteria
symbiosis, funded by NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity
grant.
Plant symbiosis with nitrogen-xing cyanobacteria is
a unique form of mutualistic association that has inde-
pendently evolved in diverse lineages including a few
species of bryophytes, ferns, cycads, and one small genus
of owering plants. Compared to other nitrogen-xing
microbes, cyanobacteria are generally less dependent on
the plant host, and therefore could be an ideal partner
for engineering symbiotic nitrogen xation into crop
plants. However, our current understanding of plant-
cyanobacteria symbioses is limited. The phylogenetic
diversity of cyanobionts has been largely unexplored,
and very few studies have investigated variation in the
symbiotic interaction. In addition, most genetic research
has solely focused on the model cyanobiont Nostoc punc-
tiforme, and the plant genes involved in symbiosis re-
main unknown. Hornworts one of the three bryophyte
lineages are an ideal system to study cyanobacterial sym-
biosis, primarily because of the groundwork laid by our
lab and collaborators. This project aims to investigate
the phylogenetic, functional, and genetic dimensions of
hornwort-cyanobacteria symbiosis.
Essential Job Functions:
The postdocs are encouraged to develop their own re-
search questions as long as they are related to hornwort-
cyanobacteria symbiosis. These could include:
1. Carry out microcosm experiments to examine
hornwort-cyanobacteria symbiotic interaction and test
selectivity and specicity.2. Sequence and analyze hornwort and cyanobacteria
genomes, and correlate the genomic features with sym-
biotic behaviors.
3. Identify the chemical signals exchanged between
hornworts and cyanobacteria.
4. Characterize the genetic elements underlying the
symbiosis.
Qualications
1. Ph.D. in plant science, microbiology, bioinformatics,
or related elds.
2. Ability to work independently and creatively.
Anticipated start date: June-September 2022

\Natural selection does not work as an engineer works.
It works like a tinkerer - a tinkerer who does not know
exactly what he is going to produce." (F. Jacob, 1977).
Standing on the shoulders of Fran cois Jacob, among oth-
ers, in our team we aim at understanding and predicting
biological functions by rationalizing evolutionary prop-
erties that can be extracted from the immense resource
of publicly available genome sequences.

in an interdisciplinary framework that combines compar-
ative genomics (recruited postdoc), biophysical models
of molecular dynamics (Isabelle Andr e's team, Toulouse
Biotechnology Institute) and biochemical experiments
(our team). A major goal is to provide predictions
of natural, articial and ancestral enzymes (enzymes
resurrection) that will be experimentally tested.

project funded by the Swiss National Science Founda-
tion is led by Blake Matthews (Eawag) and also includes
a collaboration with Ryan Greenway (University of Kon-
stanz). The Fish Genomics group of Philine Feulner
focuses on evolutionary questions regarding the genetic
basis of adaptation and speciation, and the inuences
of various evolutionary processes such as selection, drift,
mutation, and recombination on genome evolution.
The project will investigate multiple stickleback pop-
ulations in small to medium sized lakes across South-
ern Greenland, using a combination of existing whole
genome data sets and new sequencing conducted
throughout the project. The rst major goal of the
project is to infer demographic histories for dierent
lake populations and explore to which respect coloniza-
tion histories varied and inuenced phenotypic varia-
tion across lakes. The second goal is to track initial
evolutionary changes of stickleback from a recent experi-
mental introduction of stickleback into six experimental
ponds. This will involve existing sequencing data from
the ancestors and new data sequenced from the rst
few generations. Within the larger project, which is
also including a PhD position, the genomic data of the
sticklebacks will be interpreted in the context of how
stickleback evolve in response to both predation and
prey community dynamics.
The candidate will be in charge of the analysis of next
generation whole genome data of sticklebacks, the de-velopment of bioinformatics pipelines and tools, and the
interpretation and publication of the results. There will
be opportunities to gain eld experience in Southern
Greenland, to develop their own research skills, and
to assist in the supervision of Bachelors and Master
students. Ideally, the candidate has a profound interest
in Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics and has
earned a PhD in a relevant eld of evolutionary biol-
ogy, or bioinformatics. Excellent communication skills
in English and ability and will to work in a team are
essential. The group's working language is English and
uency in writing and speaking is required. Knowledge
of German or French is not required.
The position is situated in the Department of Fish
Ecology & Evolution: www.eawag.ch/en/department/-
shec/. The Department is part of Eawag's Center for
Ecology, Evolution & Biogeochemistry (CEEB), which
is located on the shore of Lake Lucerne and is a strong

We seek an ambitious and skilled postdoctoral scien-
tist to undertake innovative research into combatting
infectious disease outbreaks in animals.
Through close collaboration with global industrial part-
ners and national government agencies, you will help
pioneer how virus genomic sequencing approaches can be
adapted and adopted to provide real-time information
critical for informing interventions. You will become a
key member of Dr Sarah Hill's research group during
the 3-year post.
Key challenges will involve the design and renement
of rapid targeted and metagenomic genome sequencing
approaches that can be used successfully within var-
ied animal health, farming and aquaculture contexts.
By combining newly generated virus genome sequences
with detailed epidemiological, ecological, and industry
data (including rarely available data on the network
of individual host movements between farms), you will
help gain high-resolution insights into the factors that
drive virus transmission and the repeated emergence
of new virulent strains. You will focus on explaining
the transmission of two viruses within the production
network of farmed Atlantic salmon.
Working in close partnership with the world's largest
provider of animal health diagnostics will allow you
to access samples and rarely available industry data
from producers across the globe. Through funded visits
to Norway and Scotland you will develop strong rela-
tionships with industry partners, which will enable you
to see the impact of your work and help achieve the
widespread adoption of the methods that you design.
We will support you to travel to international and na-
tional conferences, and to access opportunities at the
RVC and elsewhere that will enhance your professional
career development. You will be encouraged to pub-
lish in high impact, international journals, including
through collaborating with other researchers within the
RVC community working on a range of emerging ani-
mal and human pathogens. Please see Dr Hill's Google

in small populations
H >1
2lar Universityseeks a three-year post-doctoral fel-
low for an Icelandic Research Council (RANNIS) funded
project. The goal is to study spatial and temporal vari-
ation in tness, using data collected in a longitudinal
study of sixteen small, isolated populations of Arctic
charr found in lava caves, which we have followed since
2012.
The project is led by Assoc. Prof Camille Leblanc
and Prof Bjarni K. Kristj >1

The phenotype is an important determinant of the dy-
namic interactions between ecological and evolutionary
processes. However, to date, there is limited understand-
ing of how spatio-temporal variation in phenotypes is
related to tness in the wild. Our study uses longitudi-
nal data across a unique system of sixteen isolated small
populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) inhabit-
ing lava caves near lake M >1
2vatn, Iceland. Individual-
based data has been collected from these populations
since 2012. This study system allows us to ask ques-
tions about the interplay between phenotypic traits (e.g.
growth and morphology) and tness (reproductive suc-
cess and survival) and how ecological factors shape this
relationship in space and time.
We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral can-84 EvolDir May 1, 2022
didate with strong quantitative skills, which will be
applied to this unique study system. The post-doctoral
fellow has the opportunity to: 1) use molecular tools
to establish genetic pedigrees and assess reproductive
success; 2) use mark-recapture data to estimate survival;
and 3) combine these with individual-based phenotypic
data to understand the interplay between ecological,
phenotypic and tness variation. The postdoctoral fel-
low will have opportunities to develop the focus of their
work and will be encouraged to further develop their
research career by opportunities in developing spin o
projects, and through student supervision.
Location: The candidate will be based at the Dept.
of Aquaculture and Fish Biology (DAFB - http://-
holaraquatic.is ) at H >1
2lar University (HU, North Ice-
land). The candidate is also encouraged to spend time
at the institutes of the collaborators. HU is situated in

where the postdoc is part of a dynamic international
team of graduate students and faculty. The beautiful
natural setting and central location in North of Iceland,
allow both outdoor and cultural activities.
Requirements: The candidate must hold a PhD degree
in Ecology or Evolution or a related discipline. The ideal
candidate should have a strong interest in evolutionary
ecology and strong quantitative skills. A background in
bioinformatics and/or analysis of quantitative genetic
and/or long-term data sets would be an advantage. The
candidate should have shown ability to publish their
own ndings, enjoy working in a dynamic group, and
have experience with eldwork. The candidate should
be able to work independently as well as a part of a

sition.
*Keywords:*population genetics, invasive species, repro-
ductive modes (clonality, allogamy, autogamy), demog-
raphy, spatial structure, dispersal.
*Context:*
|{
Invasive species are good opportunities to understand
how para- and peri-patric populations contribute to the
biological evolution of organisms. Reproductive modes
are key component to understand and predict the suc-
cess of invasive species, with deep consequences on their
demography, dispersal, genetic and phenotypic evolu-
tion and adaption to the new habitats. Understanding
the impacts of reproductive modes, demography and
dispersal on the genetic diversity of a newly introduced
species colonizing new areas will help predicting evolu-
tions of invasive populations and inferring the ecological
and evolutionary processes driving their biology.
The ANR Clonix2D project ^1 is an international, col-
laborative project aiming at understanding the evo-
lutionary consequences of partial clonality on genetic
diversity and it structure during colonization events us-
ing a multidisciplinary approach involving mathematical
modelling, simulations, and population genomics using
various model species across the eurkaryotic domain.May 1, 2022 EvolDir 85
We developed demogenetic models and methods to un-
derstand, track and predict the evolution of partially
clonal, polyploid populations colonizing new areas. We
currently use these mathematical models to infer the
ecological and evolutionary processes ongoing on the
major aquatic invasive populations of /Ludwigia grandi-
ora/ subsp. /hexapetala /(Lgh) colonizing western Eu-
rope watersheds. We demonstrated that this decaploid
/Ludwigia/ species reproduces using both sexuality and
clonality and mates through a self-incompatible with
at least one self-compatible type capable of selng. We
recently acquired a huge genotyping dataset on 37 pop-
ulations over the Loire watershed, including temporal
and parentage sampling on fewer populations.
We propose a postdoc position for 18 months to ex-
plore the ecological and evolutionary processes ongoing
in these partially-clonal polyploid invasive populations,
using their current genetic diversity and structure.

The recruited applicant will join the genetic, ecology and
evolution group of INRAE/Institut Agro group working
on theoretical and applied population biology in Rennes
(France) with direct collaboration with Solenn Stoeckel
(Demecology, IGEPP ^2 ) and Dominique Barloy (Evo-
lutionary ecology of systems perturbed by biological
invasions and xenobiotics, ESE ^3 ) for 18 months, daily
available for group discussions, analyses and co-writings.
Monthly gross salary from 2 800 euro to 3 000 euro , de-
pending on professional experience, including vacation.
Our team and Rennes research community constitute a
friendly, open, inclusive, egalitarian and ecient envi-
ronment to tackle ecological and evolutionary studies
about invasive species, reproductive modes and the dy-

people in genetics, ecology, mathematical modelling and
computing sciences., collaborative analyses
*Duties:*

These datasets include i/ the numerical outputs of
the adaptable mathematical and simulation models, ii/
the already-acquired /Ludwigia grandiora/ genotyp-

and potentially allo- and auto-gamous species across
the eukaryote domains (publicly available, or in col-laboration within the project with partners studying

Postdoctoral Research Associate - Machine Learning and
Computer Vision for Cranial Suture Evolution through
the Synapsid-Mammal Transition
We are currently advertising for a 2-year Postdoctoral
Research Associate in Machine Learning and Computer
Vision at the Natural History Museum, London. The
Natural History Museum is one of the world's top muse-
ums and is internationally recognised as a leader in the
study of the natural world through its collections and its
role as a centre of excellence in scientic research and in
the presentation of natural history through exhibitions,
public programmes, publications and the web. This post
will be based jointly in the Department of Life Sciences
at the Natural History Museum (primary institution)
and the School of Engineering at London South Bank
University, working with PI Anjali Goswami, Co-Is En-
rico Grisan, Alana Sharp, and Arkhat Abzhanov, and
PDRA Heather White. The successful applicant for this
post will be responsible for developing machine learning
and computer vision tools for the automated extraction
of cranial suture morphology and skull shape from 3D
meshes for living and fossil specimens spanning the past
and present diversity of synapsids, the clade that today
is represented by mammals
This post is funded by a Leverhulme research grant that
will focus on the evolution of cranial sutures through
the synapsid to mammal transition. The mammal skull
performs numerous critical functions, from prey capture
and feeding to protecting the brain to ghting. These
functions impose enormous pressures which are buered
by the skull's shock absorbers: cranial sutures. These
highly variable joints between skull bones are intimately
linked with ecology and development, but their complex
3D anatomy makes them tricky to capture using tradi-
tional methods. As a result, we know almost nothing
about their macroevolutionary patterns. Bridging imag-
ing, machine learning, cranial function and evolution,
this project will reconstruct suture evolution and its role
in one of the most important events in the history of life:
the rise of mammals. The successful candidate will work
closely with the PIs, Co-Is, and an evolution PDRA in
developing these methods and applying them to a new
cranial dataset for synapsids. They will be expected
to lead on scientic publications describing these newmethods, including open access, user-friendly tools, and
present at conferences, as well as promote the project at
various outreach events at the NHM and outside the mu-
seum as the opportunity arises. We provide a friendly,
exible, and collaborative environment to accommodate
and support diverse circumstances, backgrounds, and
needs.
Main Responsibilities
* Develop novel machine learning and computer vision
tools for automated extraction of cranial suture morphol-
ogy from 3D meshes * Lead or contribute to development
and renement of tools for automated capture of skull
shape data from 3D meshes * Develop tools applicable
to surface and micro-CT scans * Write well-documented
code and produce user-friendly tools for open access
dissemination * Work closely with project team, includ-
ing Evolution PDRA, PI, and Co-Is for delivery of the
full project * Lead and contribute to research publica-
tions * Present results at scientic conferences * Travel
to work with collaborators as needed * Contribute to
future research proposals

FormFunctionSpiderEvolution
Postdoctoral Fellowship: Combining Functional Data
with 3D Morphometrics to Understand the Evolution
of Spider Chelicerae (\Jaws")
Drs. Hannah Wood and Je Shultz are seeking a 2-year
Postdoctoral Fellow. The appointment has the possibil-
ity to extend one year, for a total of three years. The
Fellow will be primarily based at the National Museum
of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, in Wash-
ington DC, working with Hannah Wood, but will also
collaborate closely with Je Shultz at the University of
Maryland, College Park. The ideal applicant will have a
strong interest in morphology and evolution, strong ca-
pabilities to work and learn independently, and a proven
publication record.
This Postdoctoral Fellowship is funded by the National
Science Foundation and has the goal of examining the
evolution of cheliceral form and function across spi-
ders using several dierent methodologies: 1) gathering
UCE sequence data and phylogenetic analysis; 2) micro-
Computed-Tomography scanning and 3D-morphometric
analysis; 3) histological sectioning; 4) high-speed videog-
raphy of cheliceral strikes; 5) comparative phylogenetic
techniques.
There is exibility in tailoring this position to the ap-
plicant's research interests. Ideally though, the Post-
doctoral Fellow will have experience or a strong interest
in learning how to analyze and process 3D shape data
from micro-Computed-Tomography scans. The Fellow
will have some freedom to develop their own projects,
although ideally their research interests will align with
the goals of the project, that of using phylogenetics
and functional morphology to understand morphologi-
cal diversication. Applicants can come from a variety
of backgrounds, but we are particularly interested inthose with a strong interest in functional morphology
and evolution.
Responsibilities include: - Initiate and perform research
on the morphology, function and evolution of spider
chelicerae (\jaws"), and writing up the results of this
research for publication in peer-reviewed journals. - Col-
laborating with other personnel involved in the project,
which includes PIs, graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents, and interns at both NMNH and UMD. - Par-
ticipating and presenting at scientic conferences. -
Participating in outreach activities, such as interacting
with the public at NMNH and developing activities for
children at \Bug Camp", and acquiring mentoring expe-
rience. - Career development with the goal of building
a strong CV and job application prole.
Starting salary is $61,915, and includes benets for
Smithsonian non-federal Trust hires and built-in salary
increases each year. The position can begin as soon as
the NMNH hiring process is complete - typically taking
3 months.
To be considered, send an email to Hannah
(woodh@si.edu) or Je (jshultz@umd.edu) that includes
the following attachments: 1) a cover letter expressing
your interest and your qualications for the position,
2) your curriculum vitae, and 3) names and contact
information of 2-3 professional references.
To receive full consideration, submit your application
by April 20, 2022; however, we will consider applicants
until the position is lled.
Please email Hannah Wood (woodh@si.edu) or Je
Shultz (jshultz@umd.edu) with any questions or con-
cerns about this position.

after receiving the oer. You will conduct research as
a part of the newly established Norwegian Centre for
Arctic Ecosystem Genomics (ArcEcoGen) and will be
part of the methodological development working group.
The position will focus on developing new methods for
processing and annotating DNA metabarcoding data.
Our group has been analysing modern and ancient envi-
ronmental samples using DNA metabarcoding for many
years. We have a large collection of datasets correspond-
ing to these samples, and a great deal of expertise on
how to process them modularly. We now want to take
advantage of this data collection to develop an ecient
machine learning-based system capable of establishing
cleaning and annotation rules for multiple broad taxo-
nomic groups conditional on the ecosystem studied. The
rules and annotations proposed by the system can be
compared with those established empirically. While the
architecture of the system remains to be dened in col-
laboration with the person recruited, it should be based
on a database that can archive all the raw data and their
annotation, and on, for example, a machine learning
system backed up by this database. The position holder
will also participate in teaching, outreach, and assis-
tance to the ArcEcoGen members. It is expected that
the position holder will participate in research group
collaboration and professional networks nationally and
internationally and will also be encouraged to obtain ex-
ternal funding from national and international funding
agencies (e.g. RCN/EU).

*Postdoc position: Escalation of TE-related genomic
conict under hybridization in birds*
An SNSF-funded 2-3-year postdoc position on bird
genomics is available in the research group of Reto
Burri at the Swiss Ornithological Institute (http://-
www.vogelwarte.ch), Switzerland.
*The Project* The project is fully funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation (SNSF). It focuses on a
songbird system characterized by pervasive hybridiza-
tion to test key hypotheses on the role of escalating
genomic conicts between TEs and their repressors in
reproductive isolation. To this end, the research lever-
ages extensive linked-read genome resequencing data to
test the hypotheses that (1) hybrids exhibit increased
TE proliferation and thereby increased rates of chro-
mosomal rearrangements (SVs) and (2) the TE-related
genomic conict constrains gene ow between species.
The research builds on available state-of-the-art genomic
resources.
*The working environment* The research group is in-
terested in the molecular underpinnings of phenotypic
adaptation and speciation in birds and the trajecto-
ries along which they evolve. To this end, we apply
population genomic, phylogenomic, and comparative
genomic tools on large-scale whole-genome resequencing
data. The host institution, the Swiss Ornithological
Institute (http://www.vogelwarte.ch), is a non-prot re-
search institute in Switzerland. We perform research on
birds to address basic scientic and applied/conservation
questions, disseminate information on bird ecology andconservation to the public, media, and authorities, and
provide foundations for the eective conservation of
birds. Together with our partners, we aim to ensure
that nature benets from the existing scientic knowl-
edge.
*Your specic tasks and qualications* The success-
ful applicant holds a PhD degree and has experience
in genomics and/or population genomics, ideally with
a specialization in the inference and analyses of TEs
and/or SVs and a solid background in population ge-
nomics, or genomics of adaptation/speciation. Your
main tasks will be the inference and validation of TEs
and SVs at population scale and the testing of hypothe-
ses deriving from theories on genomic conict and its
role in speciation.
*We oer* - A dynamic, young, international research
group working on bird population genomics - Collabo-
rations with leading international researchers - A salary
in accordance with the regulations of the Swiss National
Science Foundation (http://www.snf.ch) at the salary
scale of the Swiss Ornithological Institute (ca. 80'000.-
CHF gross in the rst year).
The position is open for 2-3 years. Preferred starting
date is 1st September 2022. Please submit your appli-
cation *in a single PDF*, including (i) a motivation
letter detailing your research interests and t to the
position (max. 2 pages), (ii) your CV including publi-
cations, and (iii) contact details of 2-3 academic refer-
ences. Please submit your application by email to Reto

EnvironmentalMicrobialGenomics
The Ecosystems and Global Change Group led by Prof
Andrew Tanentzap at the University of Cambridge
(www.ecosystemchange.com) is seeking a full-time
Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA). The
PDRA will join a new project funded by the Canada-
Inuit Nunangat-United Kingdom Arctic Research
Programme (https://www.ukri.org/what-we-oer/-
browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/canada-
inuit-nunangat-uk-arctic-research-programme/). The
project seeks to develop a community-led wildlife health
monitoring programme for Nunavik with a highly
multidisciplinary team of 14+ Inuit, Canadian, and UK
researchers, including anthropologists, epidemiologists,
and veterinarians. The PDRA will interact with this
larger team and receive additional supervision from
Prof James Wood (www.vet.cam.ac.uk/sta/professor-
james-wood-obe).
The primary goal of this post is to develop and vali-
date novel techniques to detect wildlife diseases at a
watershed-scale using eDNA/eRNA. The PDRA will be
responsible for co-designing sampling approaches with
Inuit partners and embedding in local communities to
sample drainage waters across Nunavik. In the lab, they
will use state-of-the-art genomics approaches to estimate
the presence and abundance of known pathogens of con-
cern. These estimates will be validated with targeted
qPCR assays on tissue samples collected from a range of
keystone Arctic species (e.g., caribou, ptarmigan, seal,
beluga Arctic char) by local hunting and trapping as-
sociations. Using the sequencing data, the PDRA will
also identify gene transfer events and emerging zoonosis
risks.
A key objective of the project is to build long-term ca-
pacity in Inuit Nunangat research in accordance with
the National Inuit Strategy on Research. The PDRAMay 1, 2022 EvolDir 103
will therefore develop online training materials in bioin-
formatics and deliver a short course at the end of the
project on the analysis of genetic sequence data at the
Nunavik Research Centre.
The post can start immediately, and funds are available
for up to 36-months subject to satisfactory completion
of a 6-month probationary period. Salary ranges from
 >1
233,309 to  >1
240,927 per year.
The successful candidate must have a proven track
record of publication in leading peer-reviewed journals,
ideally demonstrating innovative approaches in the study
of eDNA/eRNA. They will have a PhD in microbial ge-
nomics, bioinformatics or a related subject. A track
record of engagement with community-led science, and
some experience with developing training materials, is
highly desirable.

ULausanne PlantSexualSystems
Postdoc, University of Lausanne, Switzerland: Evolu-
tion of plant sexual systems
A postdoc position is open in John Pannell's lab in
the Department of Ecology and Evolution, University
of Lausanne, to study the evolution of plant sexual
systems, with a focus on evolutionary transitions be-
tween hermaphroditism and dioecy. The scope of the
project can be partly tailored to the particular interests
of the successful applicant. We are currently using ex-
perimental evolution to address questions concerning
the quantitative genetics and genomic architecture of
sexual-system transitions, including but not only sex
chromosomes. The postdoc could potentially play a
leading role in taking this study forward (it is now in its
11th year), with substantial latitude to use the genetic
material generated so far to conduct further experiments
and/or investigate the genomic architecture of responses
to selection. The postdoc could also study aspects of
sex-chromosome evolution in plants, working on one of
three dierent study systems we have developed in the
lab to understand links between sex chromosomes, sex
allocation and sexual dimorphism.
The project could start from September 2022, but
the starting date is exible. Further details about
the lab, including recent papers on which this project
will build, can be found at: https://www.unil.ch/dee/-
pannell-group, or on writing to john.pannell@unil.ch.Research scope and skills sought The successful can-
didate for this position should have a strong interest
and background in evolutionary biology and evolution-
ary genomics, including wet-lab skills and experience
in the analysis of genomic data. He/she should also
have proven ability to write up research results, as
demonstrated in published or accepted papers, or in
high-quality preprints, good communication and inter-
personal skills, and an ability to work in a team. Al-
though not a requirement (the language of the lab and
the research environment of the department is English),
some knowledge of French would be an asset. Ideally,
the candidate will have received his/her PhD in the last
couple of years.
Host Department and University The Department of
Ecology and Evolution hosts a broad range of research
groups, and its members enjoy a lively intellectual and
social life. Although the University of Lausanne is fran-
cophone, the department is highly international, and
all its research activity and seminars are conducted in
English. The University has seven faculties and approx-
imately 14,300 students and 3,900 researchers from over
120 countries. It is situated on a beautiful campus on
the shore of Lake Geneva, and is close to the Swiss and
French Alps.

wing color pattern evolutionary and functional genomics
Two Postdocs positions in evolutionary and functional
genomics.
The Papa's lab (https://www.riccardopapalab.com) is
in San Juan, the capital of the beautiful island of Puerto
Rico, which provides amazing research opportunities and
lifestyle. The selected postdoc will explore the genetic
and epigenetic source of variation for natural selection
and adaptation to work upon.This research project will
investigate what governs patterns diversity, what limitsit, and what promotes its potentials. To do so, methods
of pure genetics, phylogenetics, epigenetics, single cell
genomics, developmental cell biology, and functional
genomics will be utilized. The nal goal is to charac-
terize the molecular architecture of single cells/scales of
unique colors.
Two NSF-funded postdoctoral positions are available in
the laboratory of Dr. Riccardo Papa in the Department
of Biology of the University of Puerto Rico, R o Piedras
Campus. These positions are looking to increase di-
versity in the research group and foster collaboration
and knowledge transfer. The laboratory has a rich back-
ground in studying the natural history of Heliconius but-
teries, with a genomic, evolutionary developmental fo-
cus. Our research is using high-end genomic approaches
and functional assays to characterize the genetic and
epigenetic architecture of color pattern development in
butteries. We are using whole genome resequencing,
ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and CRISPR to better understand
the pathways involved in color pattern development and
their evolution. We have enough data to test strong
hypotheses in buttery wing color pattern development
using a single cell genomic approach. Our lab has state
of the art genomic technology which includes, an Illu-
mina Miseq, an Illumina NextSeq 2000, and a single
cell 10X Chromium among many other equipment. We
generate all the data locally and can perform CRISPR
experiments using our buttery rearing facility.
SPECIAL REQUISITES
The candidate must have completed a Ph.D. degree,
preferably in the areas of genomics, population genetics,
developmental biology and or computational biology.
The position requires skills in the areas of genomics,
development and computational biology, and a strong
record of research in these areas. Being highly moti-
vated will be necessary to collaborate with National and
International research groups. The work will focus on
bioinformatics methods to analyze large genomic and
epigenomic data. Specically, this includes generating
single cell genomic data and building pipelines to assem-
ble and analyze such dataset (epigenetic and expression)
to determine cell fate and buttery's wing color pat-
tern development with a precision never available before.
Candidates from Minority Serving Institutions (MSI)
are strongly encouraged to apply for the position

The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Land-
scape Research WSL is part of the ETH Domain. Ap-
proximately 600 people work on the sustainable use and
protection of the environment and on the handling of
natural hazards. The Research Unit Biodiversity and
Conservation Biology studies the diversity of life in its

sampling and genetic evaluation is impractical and ex-
pensive. This project will use state-of-the art genomics
and optical spectroscopy to develop a protocol based on
machine learning to uncover the relationship between
the two. Field data will be collected by our team at
three sites during the summer of 2022. Although the
position will be based at the WSL, the future postdoc
will closely interact with Prof Dr Meredith Schuman and
her research group in Spatial Genetics at the University
of Zurich (https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/sg.html)

population genomics can be used to inform conservation.
The instructors will guide students through study de-
sign, genomic data collection methods, handling of raw
genomic data, and SNP ltering to produce a dataset.
Then, we will work through a suite of analyses look-
ing at population structure, local adaptation, eective
population size, inbreeding and relatedness. We will
provide background on the theory and application of
these analyses, and then run hands-on exercises running
analyses and interpreting results. Through hands-on
exercises, the course will teach basic bioinformatics skills
and how to manipulate, visualize and interpret genomic
data and patterns in a conservation related context.

Online IntroAncientMetagenomics
Aug1-5
Dear colleagues,
The SPAAM Community is oering a new 5 day virtual
summer school course sponsored by the Werner Siemens
Foundation:*Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics*.
DATE AND SCHEDULE: Online from Monday 1st to
Friday 5th of August from 09:00 to 17:00 (CEST, Leipzig
time zone).
ORGANISERS: Dr. Christina Warinner (Harvard Uni-
versity, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthro-
pology) and James Fellows Yates (Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leibniz Institute for
Natural Product Research and Infection Biology Hans
Kn- ll Institute).
INSTRUCTORS: Dr. Aida Andrades Valtue- a, Dr.
Thiseas C. Lamnidis, Dr. Arthur Kocher, Dr. Alex H-
bner, Dr. Irina Velsko, Dr. Alexander Herbig, Megan
Michels, Alina Hi- , Clemens Schmid, Maxime Borry
(and more TBC)
COURSE OVERVIEW: Ancient metagenomics applies
cutting-edge metagenomic methods to the degraded
DNA content of archaeological and paleontological spec-
imens. The rapidly growing eld is currently uncovering
a wealth of novel information for both human and natu-
ral history, from identifying the causes of devastating
pandemics such as the Black Death, to revealing how
past ecosystems changed in response to long-term cli-
matic and anthropogenic change, to reconstructing the
microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, as
the eld grows, the techniques, methods, and workows
used to analyse such data are rapidly changing and
improving.
In this *hands-on summer school (block praktikum)*-
we will go through the main steps of ancient metage-
nomic bioinformatic workows, familiarising students
with the command line, demonstrating how to process
next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data, and showing
how to perform de novo metagenomic assembly. Focus-
ing on host-associated ancient metagenomics, the course
consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on ex-
ercises, allowing participants to become familiar withthe types of questions and data researchers work with.
Round table discussions with experts at each stage of
the workow will be held to allow participants to get
advice on their own projects and research.
By the end of the course, participants will have an un-
derstanding of how to eectively carry out the major
bioinformatic components of an ancient metagenomic
project in an open and transparent manner. Atten-
dees will be eligible for ECTS points (awarded by the
JSMC Graduate School, Friedrich-Schiller University,
Germany) or a certicate of completion (Max Planck -
Harvard Research Center, MHAAM).

ABOUT THIS COURSE
This community analytics course is designed for students
who have recently started their projects or researchers
who are starting using the R ecosystem. During this
three-day course, we will cover the basic concepts of
multivariate analysis and their implementation in R.
This course is a complement to the PR Statistic oering
allowing also beginners and non-programmers to dis-
cover the statistical tools needed to analyze an ecological
dataset in research, natural resource management or
conservation context. This course is not geared toward
any particular taxonomic group or ecological system.
We will cover diversity indices, distance measures and
multivariate distance-based methods, clustering, classi-
cation, and ordination techniques. We will focus on
the concept of the methods and their implementation
on R using dierent R packages. We will use real-world
examples to implement analyses, such as describing pat-
terns along gradients of environmental or anthropogenic
disturbances, quantifying the eects of continuous and
discrete predictors, data mining. The course will consist
of lectures, work on R code scripts, and exercises for

Online MacroevolutionaryAnalyses
May2-6
Dear colleagues,
There are a few slots available for Transmitting Sci-
ence online course Introduction to Macroevolutionary
Analyses Using Phylogenies - 10th Edition.
Dates: May 2nd-6th, 2022 Monday to Friday, from 15:00
to 19:00 (Madrid time zone)
Instructor: Dr. Juan L. Cantalapiedra (Universidad de
Alcal >1
2, Spain)
COURSE OVERVIEW
Phylogenetic trees have changed the way we study and
understand life on Earth. Taking phylogenetic informa-
tion into account in our analyses is critical to account
for the non-independence of biological data. Also, phy-
logenies allow us to get a deep-time perspective of the
processes that have shaped the evolutionary history
of groups, including diversication and trait evolution.
This course will introduce participants to the use, mod-ication and representation of phylogenetic trees. Also,
we will focus on the use of phylogenetic information to
reconstruct ancestral characters and biogeographic histo-
ries, using dierent phylogenetic comparative methods.
This course will also tackle trait evolution modelling
and the assessment of phylogenetic signal. Finally, we
will learn about the shape of phylogenetic trees and its
evolutionary causes, and how to estimate the rates of
diversication throughout the history of groups. Par-
ticipants are encouraged to bring their data sets to
use in the practical classes. The course includes an
optional rst introductory day to basic R. Important
note: Please bear in mind that this course is not about
reconstructing (building) phylogenetic trees. Software:
Mesquite, FigTree, R (ape, TreeSim, TreePar, Geiger,
OUwie, BioGeoBEARS).

Online MappingTraitEvolution
Jul4-8
Dear colleagues,
Transmitting Science is oering a new edition of the
course Mapping Trait Evolution 5th edition. This course
will be held live online (synchronous). Max 16 partici-
pants.
Dates: July 4th-8th, 2022, from 14:00 to 18:00 (Madrid
time zone)
Instructor: Jeroen Smaers (Stony Brook University,
USA)
COURSE OVERVIEW
The course provides a comprehensive overview of the
state-of-the-art methods in mapping phenotypic trait
evolution and will provide participants with a spring-
board to using these methods to answering their own
research questions.
We focus on analyses that use a phylogenetic tree and
observed trait information from tip taxa (extant and/or
extinct) to describe how traits have changed along the
branches of a phylogeny. The course covers methods
that estimate and test patterns related to changes in
mean, covariation, and rate. Applications for contin-
uous and categorical, and univariate and multivariate
research designs are discussed.
At the end of this course, participants will have devel-
oped an understanding of:
(1) Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck modelsof evolution.
(2) How these models can be applied to estimate and
test patterns of trait evolution.
(3) What the advantages and disadvantages are of dif-
ferent models/methods.
(4) How to recognize which model/method is most appro-
priate given a particular dataset and research question.
We provide several data sets that will be used to exem-
plify the application of these methods. We do, however,
encourage participants to work with their own data so
as to get direct experience with analysing precisely what
they expect to analyse.
Methods from the following R packages will be dis-
cussed: ape, geiger, phytools, evomap, l1ou, bayou,
surface, OUwie, mvMORPH, geomorph (this list may
change as new packages become available).
Important note: Please bear in mind that this course is
not about reconstructing (building) phylogenetic trees,
the methods we cover in this course assume that a phy-
logeny is known.

Online Palaeogenomics May17-21
Dear colleagues,
Transmitting Science is oering a new course: Intro-
duction to Palaeogenomics - concepts, methods and
applications of ancient human and non-human DNA
data.
Date and schedule: Online live sessions from Monday
17th to Friday 21st of May from 16:00 to 21:00 (GMT+2,
Madrid time zone).
Instructors: Dr. Marcela Sandoval Velsaco (University
of Copenhagen, Denmark) and Dr. Jazm >1
2n Ramos-
Madrigal (University of Copenhagen, Denmark).
COURSE OVERVIEW:
Ancient DNA (aDNA) research, dened as the retrieval
and analysis of DNA sequences from various degraded
biological materials, has been evolving as a research
eld for four decades. Through advances in DNA iso-
lation and amplication techniques, sequencing tech-
nologies and data analysis pipelines, the eld has rev-
olutionized and transitioned to what we now know as
palaeogenomics. DNA extracted from archaeological
samples, and museum specimens has proven useful to
study species and life on earth from the genomic per-
spective. It has made it possible to measure changes in
genetic diversity through time, test hypotheses about
the association of environmental phenomena and ge-
netic changes in natural populations, and to resolve
long-standing questions about the evolutionary relation-ships between species.
In a combination of interactive lectures and hands-on
practical sessions, this course will provide a theoretical
overview of molecular biology laboratory techniques for
the retrieval of aDNA from ancient samples from dif-
ferent species and an introduction to the bioinformatic
pipelines for the analysis of palaeogenomic data. Stu-
dents will be introduced to the standard bioinformatic
methods often used in palaeogenomic projects for the
analysis of aDNA data from human and non-human sam-
ples. We will also review the history and developments
of the eld to understand how it came to be what it is
today, and consider and discuss the practical problems
of ancient DNA recovery, the theoretical problems as-
sociated with the interpretation of palaeogenomic data,
and the ethical implications embedded in this type of
research.
At the end of the course, students will have gained
a general understanding of common key methods and
tools used in palaeogenomics projects: from the basics
in the eld to the interpretation of the results, as well
as ethical and responsibility aspects and implications of
aDNA research.

R tools) that can be used to analyse spatial patterns
in community ecology. The umbrella concept of the
course is beta diversity, which is the spatial variation of
communities. Researchers in spatial ecology, population
genetics and landscape genetics will nd these methods
useful as they are applicable to all types of communi-
ties (bacteria, plants, animals) sampled along transects,
regular grids or irregularly distributed sites. The new
methods, collectively referred to as spatial eigen-function
analysis, are grounded into techniques commonly used
by community ecologists, which will be described rst:
simple ordination (PCA, CA, PCoA), multivariate re-
gression and canonical analysis, permutation tests. The
choice of dissimilarities that are appropriate for com-
munity composition data will also be discussed. The
focal question is to determine how much of the commu-
nity variation (beta diversity) is due to environmental
sorting and to community-based processes, including
neutral processes. Recently developed methods to par-
tition beta diversity in dierent ways will be presented.
Extensions will be made to temporal and space-time
data.

Detecting adaptive evolutionary events in genomes of
polar species at the Whitney Laboratory for Marine
Bioscience, St. Augustine, Florida July 24-27, 2022
National Science Foundation awards #1935635 and
#1935672 A two-day workshop will be held at the Whit-
ney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience (University of
Florida) during July 24 - 27, 2022. Participants should
plan to arrive on the afternoon of July 24th and depart
in the afternoon of July 27th. The workshop organizers,
Dr. Scott Santagata and Dr. Joseph Ryan, will lead
participants through a series of computational exercises
having the following goals.
§Construct orthologous gene assignments (OrthoFinder),
prune paralogous genes (PhyloPYPruner), align orthol-ogous gene (MAFFT), and multi-gene phylogenetic re-
lationships (IQ-TREE).
§Establish collaborative research groups to test for genes
under positive selection from diverse organisms and
habitats (e.g., polar, terrestrial, marine, tropical) using
genomic and transcriptomic datasets.
§Evaluate current analytical methods for determining
positive selection (e.g., PAML, HyPHy) and their sta-
tistical signicance.
Participants are encouraged to work with their own
NGS-based datasets, but sample datasets will also be
provided and analyzed using a bioinformatics platform.
Applicants with transcriptomic datasets that span eco-
logical boundaries (e.g., high vs. low latitudinal habitats,
marine vs. freshwater habitats, deep vs. shallow water
habitats, etc.) will be given priority. However, any-
one who is interested in learning these techniques is
encouraged to apply.
Lodging will be provided in the Research Vil-
lage Cottages at the Whitney Laboratory (https://-
www.whitney.u.edu/about/housing/) at no cost to par-
ticipants. Funds will also be provided to oset the
costs of round trip travel based on the number of par-
ticipants and demonstrated need. Workshop facilities
and housing are in accordance with ADA guidelines,
and we will work with any students needing accom-
modations. Researchers from underrepresented groups
and/or with disabilities are particularly encouraged to
apply. Workshop will include a code of conduct to help
ensure a safe and inclusive space. The workshop will
incorporate structured participation to ensure balance
in participation and encourage inclusion. It will include
activities that facilitate interaction within small groups.
Mentorship opportunities will be facilitated through
encouraging post-workshop interaction and mentoring.

The workshop is open to PhD students, postgraduate

Abstract: Wild populations are shaped by natural selec-
tion, sexual selection, and (mostly unintended) articial
selection. The latter include, for example, a decline of
the mean breeding value for horn size in response to
trophy hunting, or reduced individual growth rates in re-
sponse to size-selective shing. Previous research in this
context has concentrated on the evolutionary responses
in the specic traits that are under selection. The eects
of unintended articial selection on population tness
are still largely unclear. Articially changed selection
regimes can increase the genetic load of natural popula-
tions, either by directly selecting against individuals of
high breeding value for tness (e.g. if fast growth is an
indicator of low genetic load), or by relaxing natural and
sexual selection and hence reducing purifying selection
(e.g. in supportive breeding programs). We will discuss
the problem in the context of current environmental
changes and the potential of rapid evolution.
Application is now open. Participants are expected to
present and discuss their work in the light of the topic
of the workshop. Please send a title and abstract before

2o,
Portugal *
Diachronic genetic studies are required in order to in-
fer the origins and evolutionary trajectories of domestic
animals. Data spanning long time scales from zooarchae-
ological specimens allow the investigation of genomic
variation within populations over time. Analysis of
ancient DNA opens a direct window into the past for
reconstruction of the genetic history of animal popula-
tions.
The objective of this course is to provide an overview
of the most recent Archaeogenomics ndings on the
origin and evolution of domestic animals. It will also
cover some of the recommended bioinformatics tools
and methods for the study of ancient DNA genomics
data. There will be hands-on sessions, including bioin-
formatics on how to lter, infer damage patterns and
authenticate next-generation-sequencing data obtained
from archaeological specimens, as well as on population
genomics. One invited speaker in Archaeogenomics will
also contribute to the course.
At the end of the course students should understand
the importance of including genomic data concerning
past populations to make evolutionary inferences, as
well as get familiar with the challenges and peculiarities
of ancient DNA analysis.

Course description:
The concept of \characters" lies at the heart of many
central issues in evolutionary biology. Characters dis-
tinguish taxa, cause tness dierences, and generally
are the fundamental units of comparison for studies
of phenotypic evolution. Historically, the concept of
characters originated in morphology and comparative
anatomy, where it was intimately connected to the issue
of homology. At the same time, characters in evolu-
tionary genetics have been understood as the eectivedimensions along which a population is evolving. Both
the more historical and functional conceptions of biolog-
ical characters presuppose that phenotypes are modular
enough that it makes sense to compare or model parts
of organisms directly rather than whole organisms. To-
day, the notion of characters or traits is increasingly
used to describe dynamic lower-level phenomena such as
metabolic, physiological, and developmental processes.
This raises a number of challenging but interesting con-
ceptual issues. How can we dene characters or traits
when the object under study is a process? Is it pos-
sible to modularize regulatory mechanisms into quasi-
independent characters? What light can contemporary
systems biology shed on the partitioning of the pheno-
type into characters? We do not yet have answers to
these important questions. We have gathered a select
group of empirical investigators and theoreticians from
the elds of biochemistry, physiology, developmental
biology, and evolutionary biology together with mathe-
matical modelers, and philosophers of biology to discuss
how characters can be dened, identied, and charac-
terized in the age of integrative systems biology. Is it
still useful to talk about characters? And if so, what
should the concept incorporate to guide research in the
right direction? Evolutionary biology lies at the very
heart of biology. Therefore, this topic is relevant far
beyond its boundaries. Properly tackling it requires
the kind of transdisciplinary exchange of ideas and ap-
proaches we are planning to implement in this course.
The summer school is mainly aimed at early-stage (PhD
or postdoc) empirical and theoretical researchers with
a general background and/or interest in developmental
and/or evolutionary biology. More senior investigators
are welcome to apply as well. Exceptions can be made
for motivated masters students. Participants of previ-
ous Venice Summer Schools in Evo-Devo are expressly
encouraged to reapply as this course has an entirely
dierent topic than previous editions. The course will
equip participants with the conceptual tools to engage
in a productive discussion of the notion of \characters,"
and to relate this notion to their own research questions
and explanations.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
