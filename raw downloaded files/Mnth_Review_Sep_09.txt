Community genetics integrates the ﬁelds of ecology and
evolution by considering the eﬀects of intra-speciﬁc ge-
netic variation on the wider community. The general
idea is that species do not live in a stable, abiotic envi-
ronment. Instead, they interact directly and indirectly
with associated species in combination with the abiotic
environment, causing eﬀects that can be distinguished
at a community level.

Novosibirsk Bioinformatics Jun20-27
Dear colleagues,
The Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Siberian
Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences will be
hosting the International Conference on Bioinformatics
of Genome Regulation and Structure/Systems Biology
(BGRS \SB-2010) in Novosibirsk, Russia, from 20-27
June 2010. This Conference is the seventh in the series
since the ﬁrst BGRS event held in 1998.As one of the key disciplines in modern biology, bioin-
formatics is a rapidly developing science. Consequently,
each of the past BGRS events was focused on the most
important topics of that time. To keep this tradition
going, BGRS \SB-2010 will be centered on bioinformat-
ics and systems biology.
Systems biology largely focuses on the study of the or-
ganization and operation of the biological systems at
various levels: molecular genetic entities, cells, tissues,
organs and organisms on the basis of information en-
coded in their genomes.
Systems biology strongly depends on high-performance
experimental technologies:
* sequencing of genomic DNA, analysis of its between-
population and evolutionary variation;
* study of the expression of genes and gene complexes
using biochips-based modalities;
* structural and functional analysis of proteins and
metabolites using mass spectrometric methods;
* study of the structural and functional organization of
biological objects (macromolecules, chromosomes, cells,
tissues, organs, organisms) using modern microscopic
methods;
* construction of artiﬁcial molecular genetic systems
using genetic engineering techniques.
In systems biology, bioinformatics methods play by far
the most important role. With them, the researcher
can:
* accumulate and integrate experimental information
in databases;
* bring this information to computer analysis;
* perform mathematical modeling of the structural and
functional organization of living systems;
* predict new properties of living systems;
* design new rounds of experimental research.
Systems biology follows in the steps of physics where no
experiment or its interpretation is possible until pro-
found theoretical and computer-aided analyses of the
systems and processes being studied are made.
Consequently, BGRS \SB-2010 will have special fo-
cus on research eﬀorts that are based on integration
of experimental and computer-based/theoretical ap-
proaches.
The following are the particular studies, in which bioin-
formatics and systems biology meet and which are of
special interest to the Conference:
* genomics;September 1, 2009 EvolDir 7
* chromosomics;
* transcriptomics;
* proteomics;
* metabolomics;
* reconstruction and modeling of gene networks;
* cell biology;
* physiological genetics;
* developmental biology;
* evolutionary biology;
* synthetic biology;
* medical biology and pharmacology;
* biotechnology.
The results of the most recent research in these ﬁelds
will be presented. The Conference program will include
plenary papers, session papers and round tables. As
previously, we are hoping to hear from those who wish
to step down as Session Chairs and about their sugges-
tions for the sessions they wish to chair. The Session
Chairs will be oﬀered special privileges at the Confer-
ence.
You are very welcome to participate in the 7th Interna-
tional Conference on Bioinformatics of Genome Regula-
tion and Structure/Systems Biology - BGRS \SB-2010.

QueenMaryU Darwin in Humanities
https://eshop.qmul.ac.uk/events/-
eventdetails.asp?eventidS Darwin published The
Origin 150 years ago. From that point on he, and
many others, have applied evolutionary theory to
behaviour. And from that point on controversy has
never been far away. Darwin’s own work contributed
to the rise of Comparative Psychology in the latenineteenth century, which in turn impacted upon
Behaviourism. The 1970s saw the rise of Sociobiology,
and much criticism of attempts to apply evolutionary
biology to human concerns. Initially these criticisms
were grounded in Marxist ideology and set limits
to the remit of biological science: human properties
required a diﬀerent framework. More recently the
humanities and social sciences have taken a similar
view but with a post-modern twist, actively eschewing
scientiﬁc, and especially biological understanding,
and in so doing forsaking prediction. In spite of
this history of ideological criticism, what might be
termed the Human Evolutionary Behavioural Sciences
(HEBS) have diversiﬁed into Evolutionary Psychology,
Human Behavioural Ecology and Cultural Evolution,
and in so doing have ﬂourished. In this meeting we
hope to showcase new and exciting work from within
HEBS, and look at where eﬀorts should be focused in
the future. It is our contention that the humanities
and social sciences cannot ignore the central place of
evolution as a theoretical framework for understanding
human aﬀairs.
This symposium celebrates 200 years of Darwin’s birth
and 150 years since the publication of The Origin. It
also coincides with the launch of a new undergradu-
ate degree in Psychology at the School of Biological &
Chemical Sciences (Queen Mary University of London,
http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/index.html ) which is un-
derpinned by an evolutionary framework. We acknowl-
edge the generous support of the European Human Be-
haviour & Evolution Association (EHBEA), The Gal-
ton Institute and the School of Biological & Chemical
Sciences (QMUL).

Seattle SICB EvolutionMigr Jan3-7
We are sending out a call for abstracts in a session com-8 EvolDir September 1, 2009
plementing our symposium, Integrative Migration Biol-
ogy. This symposium will be held at the 2010 Society
for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meet-
ing, Jan. 3-7, Seattle, WA. We would especially like to
extend this invitation to students and post-docs, but
welcome abstracts from all researchers currently study-
ing animal migration. As a student or post-doc, this
would give you a wonderful opportunity to interact with
some of the top researchers in the ﬁeld of animal mi-
gration. We welcome submissions for both contributed
papers and posters, and encourage students to apply for
SICB’s Charlotte Mangum Student Support Program.
Please check out the SICB meeting page at http://-
www.sicb.org/meetings/2010/index.php3 for more in-
formation.
Billions of animals migrate each year, and they can have
enormous eﬀects on the communities and ecosystems
they inhabit. We wish to bring together researchers
from all over the world who are attempting to integrate
ecology, evolution, behavior, physiology, and theory in
order to understand the phenomenon of migration. In
order to migrate, organisms themselves must integrate
many aspects of behavior, physiology, genetics, and
morphology. Migration is therefore an excellent system
in which to study adaptation and the interplay between
various ecological and evolutionary levels of analysis.
Traditionally, however, researchers have tended to fo-
cus on one narrow aspect of migratory behavior to the
exclusion of all else. More recently, biologists have be-
gun to examine multiple aspects of migration in order
to better understand this important life history strat-
egy. The primary goal of this symposium is to bring
these researchers together with students and post-docs
who are just staring their research programs in order
to foster discussion and collaboration and further the
development of integrative migration biology research.
This symposium and the complementary session(s) are
designed to provide a venue for researchers from around
the globe to discuss the past, present, and future of mi-
gration research. The list of symposium speakers and
preliminary titles include:
1. Melissa Bowlin (Lund University), Isabelle-Anne
Bisson (Princeton University), & Martin Wikelski (Max
Planck Institute for Ornithology). “Integrative migra-
tion biology: Past, present, and an exciting future.”
2. Marilyn Ramenofsky (University of California
Davis). “Endocrine and metabolic parameters coincide
with daily fueling and ﬂight cycles of captive migrants.”

ComparativePhylogenetics12 EvolDir September 1, 2009
A PhD research scholarship (includes stipend and fees)
is currently available at the University of Adelaide,
School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Ade-
laide, South Australia. Information about the school,
and in particular the Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Unit can be found at http://ees.adelaide.edu.au/-
disciplines/eeb/ . The candidate must hold either Aus-
tralian or New Zealand residency status.
Project Description: The project will contribute to an
Australian Antarctic Division - funded project (AAD
2355). Speciﬁcally, the project examines compara-
tive phylogenetic and phylogeographic data for ter-
restrial invertebrates (Collembola, Acari, nematodes,
tardigrades and rotifers) to explore presence and dis-
tribution of cryptic species (biodiversity exploration),
patterns of colonisation, and recent gene ﬂow from
Australian, New Zealand, and British Antarctic ter-
ritories. Coupled with this will be a co-phylogeny of
the endosymbiotic bacteria (e.g. Wolbachia, Rickettsia,
Spiroplasma) that have been widely identiﬁed among
invertebrates. These are likely to have either been af-
fected by the long-term habitat fragmentation or may
be of a more recent origin in the Antarctic region.
The project has collaborations with the British Antarc-
tic Survey, UK (Peter Convey and Chester Sands),
Brigham Young University, US (Byron Adams), Massey
and Waikato Universities, NZ (Murray Potter and Ian
Hogg). Further information can be obtained from the
web site [ http://www.scieng.ﬂinders.edu.au/biology/-
people/academic/stevens m/], or by informal email
[Mark.Stevens@samuseum.sa.gov.au].
The expected starting date is November 2009 or as soon
as a suitable candidate is identiﬁed. The ﬁrst Antarc-
tic ﬁeld-trip (to Davis and Mawson Bases, Australian
Antarctic Territory) will be in December 2009.
Candidate Experience: Candidates for this position
should have a strong interest in invertebrate systemat-
ics and evolution and demonstrate experience in molec-
ular methods including knowledge of phylogenetic and
phylogeographic analyses. A knowledge of invertebrate
sampling techniques will be a beneﬁt. Fieldwork in
Antarctica is a critical component that requires passing
a complete medical.
To apply: Please send a cover letter, curriculum vitae,
a statement of research experience that explains your
background and speciﬁc interests in the project, and
names and contact information of at least two scien-
tists available for reference.
Please email your application as a pdf or Word (.doc)

ETH Zurich HostParasiteEvolution
ETH Zurich, Institute of Integrative Biology (IBZ) The
Experimental Ecology Group (Paul Schmid-Hempel)
is seeking to ﬁll a Ph.D. Position (Evolutionary ecol-
ogy of host-parasite systems) to work on questions
of host-parasite interactions using Bombus spp. and
theirparasites as the study system. In particular, the
project would investigate the natural diversity of host
species and their infections (of Crithidia bombi in par-
ticular). Our questions ultimately relate to the co-
evolutionary dynamics of the host interactions with
parasites, the epidemic processes in natural popula-
tions, or the spread and eﬀect of infectious parasites in
ecological communities of host species. We work with
molecular tools but the project would focus on ecolog-
ical questions. In particular, little is known about the
occurrence, distribution and correlates of parasitism in
the diverse sets of Bombus species. The project aims at
gathering this knowledge and using it to test some con-
cepts of ecological theory and host-parasite coevolution.
Problems of species invasion might be a particular topic
in this context. Although the prime motivation is ques-
tions of basic importance, the project is embedded in a
larger set of studies conducted at ETH addressing the
signiﬁcance of ecological and genetic variation in natu-
ral systems with respect to disease, climatic change and
environmental degradation.
The ideal candidate likes to work with this system,
has an interest at the crossroads of ecology, genetics
and evolution and a background in any of the rele-September 1, 2009 EvolDir 13
vant ﬁelds. Salaryand other conditions in accordance
with local regulations. The normal duration of aPhD
at ETH is 3 years. Special conditions for acceptance
into the PhD program ofETH may apply; a degree
equivalent to a M.Sc. is normally required. Pre-
ferred starting date autumn 2009 or shortly thereafter.
Please send applications, with CV, names of referees,
and short statement of your interests in this position
to Prof. Paul Schmid-Hempel, preferably by email
(psh@env.ethz.ch). Screening of applications will start
31 August 2009 or until post is ﬁlled. For more informa-

CaribbeanBarcodes
A PhD graduate research position is available in the
laboratory of Dr. Rick Hochberg, Department of Bi-
ology, University of Massachusetts Lowell, starting in
January 2010.
Description: The PhD student will contribute to an
NSF-funded project that focuses on the biodiversity
of Caribbean meiofauna. Speciﬁcally, the student will
obtain molecular barcodes (COI) to gain estimates ofSeptember 1, 2009 EvolDir 19
species richness and cryptic diversity in marine Gas-
trotricha - a phylum of microscopic invertebrates that
are abundant in coastal sediments. In particular, the
genus Tetranchyroderma contains some of the most ge-
ographically widespread and morphologically diverse
marine gastrotrichs. Most morphospecies are easily
identiﬁed by the structure of their cuticle, providing
a unique opportunty to correlate taxonomic characters
with individual DNA tags. The speciﬁc objectives of
the doctoral research are to 1) generate mitochondrial
COI sequences for the development of DNA barcodes
of Tetranchyroderma; 2) determine if molecular opera-
tional taxonomic units (MOTUs) are concordant with
the morphospecies concept for Tetranchyroderma, i.e.,
mtDNA and morphological monophyly are supported,
and 3) assist in the development of a database of hap-
lotypes with links to digital vouchers and GPS infor-
mation.
The expected starting date is January, 2010 (spring
semester). The ﬁrst Caribbean trip will be in June or
July, 2010.
Candidate Experience: Candidates for this position
should have a strong interest in invertebrate systemat-
ics and evolution and demonstrate experience in molec-
ular methods including knowledge of bioinformatics.
SCUBA certiﬁcation is beneﬁcial but not required.
Fieldwork on select Caribbean islands will occur for
2-3 weeks every summer for three years beginning in
2010; a US passport is necessary. Fluency in Spanish is
extremely valuable.
To apply: The selected student is expected to enroll
in either the 1) University of Massachusetts School
of Marine Sciences ( http://www.umassmarine.net/-
admissions/ ) or the Department of Biological Sci-
ences at the University of Massachusetts Lowell
(http://www.uml.edu/College/arts sciences/Biology/-
Programs ofStudy/graduate.html ) The candidate will
have the option of obtaining a PhD in Marine Science
and Technology (University of Massachusetts) or Bio-
chemistry (UML), respectively, depending on his/her
academic interests. Additional information about poli-
cies and entrance requirements pertaining to university
admission are found at: http://www.uml.edu/grad/
Opportunities for teaching at the undergraduate level
are available (as teaching assistantships). Current
stipends for Ph.D. research graduate students are
$20,000.

These projects integrate mathematical and biological
expertise, at an exciting time when biologists are in-
creasingly realizing the power of mathematics to make
forecasts, as other scientists have done before them.
The projects centre on making forecasts for manage-
ment of biodiversity.
Project 1: Forecasting demography of bottlenose dol-
phins With partners from Murdoch University we are
studying ecology, threats, and genetics of Bunbury
(WA) bottlenose dolphins. The PhD student at UNSW
will use these data in existing or novel programs, to
evaluate population viability with diﬀerent manage-
ment and threats. There would be ﬁeld-trips to Bun-
bury.
Project 2: Mathematics of forecasting and manag-
ing biodiversity. We have used information theory to
produce new biodiversity theory (Molecular Ecology
15:2857). The PhD would further develop this theory
and apply it to a wide range of existing datasets in
genetic and community biodiversity.
Project 3: Resilience of small populations to periods
of selection A consortium of mathematicians and biolo-
gists at UNSW has produced new theory about the way
that small endangered populations might rapidly re-
cover their responsiveness to selection. This PhD posi-
tion will follow up this theoretical work by carrying out
experiments in model populations of ﬂies. There could
be an additional stipend supplement for this project.
Project 4: Conservation of Little Penguins in New
South Wales: With Dr J Sinclair. To assess the via-
bility of an endangered population of Little Penguins20 EvolDir September 1, 2009
in Sydney Harbour under a range of threats and man-
agement strategies, by conducting a genetic and demo-
graphic analysis on NSW penguin populations to input
into a population forecasting model. There could be an
additional stipend supplement for this project.
Other projects: It is possible to negotiate other projects
in this general area of research. Note that projects
which are theoretical or use existing data in Sherwin’s
group, are much quicker to start because they can com-
mence without application for external funding of re-
search expenses!

Bottleneck and inbreeding
accumulation
Dear EvolDir,
I would like to know if anyone knows of a way to calcu-
late or simulate the accumulation of inbreeding through
a bottleneck.
I am dealing with a wild population that passed
through a bottleneck about 5 generations ago. I have
detailed population census data from the lowest point
of the bottleneck through the recovery up to the cur-
rent population. I can also provide approximate ances-
tral population sizes at intervals before the bottleneck
occurred.
I have pedigree data for the recovering population so
am able to calculate the inbreeding coeﬃcients of the
recovered population, but these are based on the as-
sumption that the founding individuals all had an in-
breeding coeﬃcient of zero, which is unlikely given the
bottleneck.
Any suggestions gratefully received.
Many thanks, Claire Raisin

Calculating multiallele Fst
I am the maintainer of a forward-time population ge-
netics simulation environment simuPOP. This program
has a Fst estimator based on Weir and Cockerham
1984. However, because simuPOP simulates large pop-
ulations and the WC84 algorithm is designed to *es-
timate* Fst of a population from a random sample,
I am trying to implement an *observed* Fst statis-
tic using observed and expected heterozygosities of a
population. The problem is that although the diallelic
case is well documented in population genetics text-
books, I could not ﬁnd a reliable reference on how
to calculate H obs (step 8 of http://www.uwyo.edu/-
dbmcd/popecol/Maylects/FST.html ) if there are more
than two alleles at a locus.
Thank you very much.

Calculating multiallele Fst answers
Dear EvolDir,
I asked a question about how to calculate multi-allele
Fst under a forward-time simulation settings and re-
ceived many helpful comments. Because other people
may be interested in this problem, I am posting some
of the comments here for future references.
Background (Original question):
I am the maintainer of a forward-time population ge-
netics simulation environment simuPOP. This program
has a Fst estimator based on Weir and Cockerham
1984. However, because simuPOP simulates large pop-
ulations and the WC84 algorithm is designed to *es-
timate* Fst of a population from a random sample,
I am trying to implement an *observed* Fst statis-
tic using observed and expected heterozygosities of a
population. The problem is that although the diallelic
case is well documented in population genetics text-books, I could not ﬁnd a reliable reference on how
to calculate H obs (step 8 of http://www.uwyo.edu/-
dbmcd/popecol/Maylects/FST.html ) if there are more
than two alleles at a locus.
Clariﬁcation:
Several people pointed out that the calculation of H obs
is easy because it is merely the frequency of heterozy-
gotes in the population. However, my question was
actually how to handle diﬀerent heterozygotes (A1A2,
A1A3, A2A3 etc) in the calculation of F st using ex-
pected and observed heterozygote frequencies. Al-
though a combined H obs could be used, it is possible
that Fst based on diﬀerent heterozygotes could be es-
timated separately, and be combined in some way. It
turned out that I was heading the wrong way. I should
not have calculated H obs (and H exp) in the ﬁrst place.
Answer 1:
Fst cannot be estimated if there are more than two alle-
les at a locus. Maybe you want to use Gst (Nei 1973)?
There are also Rst (Slatkin 1995) and more recently
Dest (Jost 2008). Feel free to take a look at my Dest es-
timator at http://www.ngcrawford.com/django/jost/
- Nick
Answer 2:
In my (perhaps fuzzy) understanding the diﬀerence be-
tween W&C’s theta (Fst) and Gst is the diﬀerence
between the estimate of the parameter (the mean of
Fst over many realizations of evolution) and realized
(~observed) value. Nei wrote a short paper on this is-
sue ( http://www.jstor.org/pss/2408586 ).
I recollect that there are published methods for cal-
culating Gst at multiallelic loci (some relevant papers
come up if you use google scholar (gst multiallelic). I
hope this helps
Richard
Answer 3:
You need to use Gst, the k allele analog of Fst. Nei was
the one who originally described Gst. See:
Nei M. 1973. Analysis of gene diversity in subdivided
populations. Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences USA 70:3321-3323.
NEI, M., 1977 F-statistics and analysis of gene diver-
sity in subdivided populations. Ann. Hum. Genet. 41:
225-233.
Takahata N, and NEI M. 1984. FsT AND GST
STATISTICS IN THE FINITE ISLAND MODEL. Ge-
netics 107: 501-504.
You might also see this paper: http://-September 1, 2009 EvolDir 43
www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/89/3/460 Matt
Summary Answer:
It turned out that Gst is equivalent to the Wright’s
Fst in the diallic case so it can be considered as an ex-
tension to Wright’s Fst in the multi-allele, multi-locus
cases. As Nei pointed out (Nei 1986, Evolution, Vol
40, No. 3), Gst calculates the ﬁxation index for ex-
isting populations for which genotype frequencies are
available, and Fst (Weir and Cockerham 1984) treats
existing populations as samples of inﬁnite many pop-
ulations derived from the same ancestral population.
In the estimation of Fst of large simulated populations
where genotype frequencies are known, Gst appears to
be more appropriate.
However, the calculation and interpretation of Fst are
still controversial, after 60+ years of study. :-) New
statistics are available (Slatkin’s Rst and Jost’s Dest),
Weir has extended his Fst estimator (Wier and Hill
2002, Annu. Rev. Genet. 36:721-50), and there are
diﬀerent ways to calculate Gst (Culley et al, American
J of Botany, 2002, 89, 460-465). For the sake of time, I
have only implemented the original Nei 1973 version of
Gst in simuPOP. New statistics could be added later.
Further discussion:
To test the new Gst statistics, I have written a short
simuPOP script to calculate Fst and Gst for a large
evolving population, and for small samples drawn from
this population. The script is posted on the simuPOP
online cookbook: http://simupop.sourceforge.net/-
cookbook/pmwiki.php/Cookbook/PopStructure .
Brieﬂy speaking, three randomly initialized subpopula-
tions (sizek) are evolved separately for 400 generations.
For every 20 generations, Fst and Gst are calculated
for the whole population, and for a random sample

2009 7:53:07 AM PDT Subject: Join E.O. Wilson,
Sean Carroll... celebrating Darwin? Reply-To:
pterry@readingodyssey.comI’m writing with a special request regarding a campaign
that a ragtag group of volunteers on Facebook has cre-
ated - along with support from E.O. Wilson, Sean Car-
roll and media partners like National Geographic. The
campaign is Darwin150 and our goal is to gather mil-
lions online to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the
publication of Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species.”
While acknowledging that you don’t know us, we would
like to ask for your help.
1. Help us get to 1 million members on Facebook We al-
ready have over 250,000 members on our Darwin Face-
book group, and want to get to 1 million members by
November 24th to show the breadth and depth of sup-
port for evolutionary theory and the signiﬁcance of Dar-
win’s great book.
Even if you don’t use Facebook yourself, please pass
this e-mail to your students, postdocs, fellow faculty
and others and ask them to join our group on Face-
book.
The link to join our Facebook group is here: http:/-

Darwin was ﬁrst
Some recent posts here have discussed the search for
the ﬁrst evolutionary tree depiction. Joel Parker, in a
post titled “Darwin was not ﬁrst!!,” suggested it was
Lamarck (1809) and Peter Gogarten suggested Pallas(1766). Augier (1801) also has been mentioned. How-
ever the development of evolutionary theory was step-
wise, so deciding on the ﬁrst tree depends on your def-
inition of evolution. Lamarck made signiﬁcant contri-
butions, but he did not have it right. Because Darwin
was the ﬁrst to propose the model of evolution we all
consider to be correct (genetics aside), it is not unrea-
sonable to consider his evolutionary trees–including his
1837 notebook tree and 1859 published tree–to be the
ﬁrst evolutionary trees in the modern sense of the word
“evolution.”

Estimating Ne answers
Hi all, Thanks to those of you who replied to my quesi-
tons. Peter Beerli’s book chapter (see below) was quite
helpful and I recommend checking it out.
Here is my orignial query:
I am using Peter Beerli’s MIGRATE program to esti-
mate Ne for a number of populations for which I have
microsatellite data. So far, I am getting reasonable Ne
estimates (I assume microsat mutation rates between
10^-4 and 10 ^-3). I would like to get some feedback on
how to properly interpret these coalescent-based esti-
mates. Speciﬁcally, I am wondering how the estimates
might be biased if:
(1) the assumption of migration-drift equilibrium is vi-
olated (2) the assumption of constant population size
has been violated (ﬂuctuating pop size or declines) (3)
the organisms have overlapping generations (which is
the case with my study organism)
Also, I have used ONeSAMP and LDNe to get esti-
mates of Ne from the linkage-disequilibrium method.
In general, the estimates I am getting from MIGRATE
are about an order of magnitude larger than the LD-
based estimates. Since the estimates from MIGRATE
are “long-term” estimates and the LD estimates are
“contemporary,” does this diﬀerence provide evidence
in support of population declines? Based on other anal-
yses, I have reason to believe my study populations have
undergone decline.
Thanks for any input or suggestions you can provide!
Ivan
Here are the replies:

of violation of >assumption (concerning eﬀects on pop-
ulation size) in MIGRATE a little. It turned out that
the estimates are long-term averages >heavily inﬂu-
enced by the recent past. In terms of coalescent events
this may be no surprise because many lineage >pairs

Some of the problems you are thinking about are
dealt with by the Lamarc program, which incorporates
growth parameters. Also, use other software to esti-
mate growth, isolantion-with-migration, and compare
with your Migrate results. If your data has quite a
straight-forward pattern all methods should give you
similar results, and if they don’t that is also interest-
ing.
>Also, my experience is that Peter Beerli himself is
very approachable and helpful if you want to ask spe-
ciﬁc questions about Migrate -n. >Ramos-Orsins et

First tree diagrams
Dear Evoldir members,
I have noticed many evolutionary biologists making an
embarrassing mistake of falsely attributing the ﬁrst use
of the tree analogy to Darwin. This has occurred in
numerous documentaries and on websites which I will
pass on naming here. Ironically, the earliest use of the
tree analogy diagram to depict evolution was published
in the year of Darwin’s birth (1809) by Lamarck in
his book Philosophie Zoologique (see pg 463, http:/-
/tinyurl.com/knt7vr ). Lamarck even uses botanical
terms (branches and rameaux) to describe the origin
of animals with respect to this ﬁgure. The ﬁgure
that is usually cited from Darwin’s notebook is from
1837 ( http://tinyurl.com/6hs5uv ), a full 8 years after
Lamarck’s death. Even with our high admiration for
Darwin, we should at least give credit where credit is
due, and not forget that much of evolution was becom-
ing understood before Darwin. Explaining the mecha-
nism of natural selection was Darwin’s great contribu-
tion.

First Tree diagrams 2David Archibald in the introduction to his work on
“Edward Hitchcock’s Pre-Darwinian (1840) ”Tree of
Life“”<http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald/-
Archibald08JHBonline.pdf >gives a good overview on
the pre Darwinian tree concept, including Augier’s 1801
Arbre botanique, and Lamarck’s Lamarck’s 1809 “tree”
diagram. Most striking I found his translation of a
text by the Russian naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from
1766: “But the system of organic bodies is best of all
represented by an image of a tree which immediately
from the root would lead forth out of the most simple
plants and animals a double, variously contiguous ani-
mal and vegetable trunk; the ﬁrst of which would pro-
ceed from mollusks to ﬁshes, with a large side branch
of insects sent out between these, hence to amphibians
and at the farthest tip it would sustain the quadrupeds,
but below the quadrupeds it would put forth birds
as an equally large side branch.” (Pallas, P.S. 1766.

Fishers classiﬁcation function
coeﬃcients
I am the maintainer of a forward-time population ge-
netics simulation environment simuPOP. This program
has a Fst estimator based on Weir and Cockerham
1984. However, because simuPOP simulates large pop-
ulations and the WC84 algorithm is designed to *es-
timate* Fst of a population from a random sample,
I am trying to implement an *observed* Fst statis-
tic using observed and expected heterozygosities of a
population. The problem is that although the diallelic
case is well documented in population genetics text-
books, I could not ﬁnd a reliable reference on how
to calculate H obs (step 8 of http://www.uwyo.edu/-
dbmcd/popecol/Maylects/FST.html ) if there are more
than two alleles at a locus.
Thank you very much.

Geneticist advice
The author of this upcoming book for parents and chil-
dren contacted the American Genetic Association in
search of a geneticist to assist in designing an educa-
tional tool. She would prefer a specialist in non-human
genetics. Please contact her if you would like to assist.
“Earn My Keep”
Traditionally, there are two ways for children to earn
allowance: by doing chores or by doing nothing at all.
I am writing a book called Earn My Keep, where chil-
dren earn money (or rewards) by taking on real adult
careers. Parents will select one career from a list of 50,
children will complete one or two or three of the tasks
listed that emulate that career and viola! They earn
their keep.
An example: This week my daughter is a contractor.
We’re using an old grocery box to make a house for one
of her favorite dolls. First we made a ’plan’ (a drawing
on a piece of notebook paper). We talked about dif-
ferent shapes for the door...where the windows should
go...why there could be a chimney...etc. Then we cut
out a door...used glue to add curtains. Today she wants
to paint on ﬂowers for the ’window boxes.’ :- >Once
that’s done, she will have earned her keep (in this case,
$2).
The program’s beneﬁts are exponential, but they hinge
on its authenticity – which means that I need/want ex-
perts to help me create the career proﬁles. My Geneti-
cist would, ﬁrst, come up with a laundry list of what
he/she does...it does not have to be fancy by any means.
I will then group that list into overarching categories.
Once those categories/responsibilities are approved by
the Geneticist, I would work on translating them into
tasks parents can do with their kids, for little or no
money. While my experts are more than welcome to
help me do the translation into tasks, I am happy to do
it on my own.
The Geneticist will have ﬁnal approval on any-
thing/everything that goes into his/her chapter. It’s
important to me that everyone involved in Earn My
Keep is excited about the ﬁnal product, and feels proud
to have been a part.

Important Papers in Evolution
I am going to try something new with my evolution
course this year. Rather than have a single required
text for the course, students will be given readings (re-
quired and recommended) from a diversity of sources
for each topic and encouraged to explore material on
their own. My goal is to get my students to see evo-
lutionary biology as a ﬁeld that transcends the texts,
something that should permeate their everyday think-
ing whether it be in the sciences or their personal lives.
Ive found that with all my classes that too many stu-
dents view the text as more than an anchor point for
further exploration, but as the end-all of the class. Ever
get the student evaluation that complains that the lec-
tures did not follow the text? Though I usually take
this kind of complaint as a compliment (it clearly is not
meant to be), it also demonstrates that I have failed in
at least one small way in my goal as an educator: a pas-
sion for learning and a willingness to go beyond the text
books. Thus my experiment this semester: do away
with the text and explore the ﬁeld using a diversity of
sources, be it primary literature, web sites, chapters
from popular books or texts, where ever we can ﬁnd
useful, engaging material. So here is where I reach out
to my colleagues and request their help in making this a
success. I have listed below some of the major themes/
topics that I feel should be included in an upper level
undergraduate evolution course at a liberal arts college.
Nothing new here, and it follows what you would ﬁnd
in most of the recent evolution texts. Please feel free to
recommend any additional topics or ordering of topics,48 EvolDir September 1, 2009
but more important, I would like to request recommen-
dations for important readings, papers, links to web
sites, simulations, laboratory exercises, chapters from
texts or books, anything you can think of for any/each
category that would assist the student in not only un-
derstanding the fundamentals of evolutionary biology,
but also the exciting dynamic nature of the ﬁeld. To
make your suggestions readily available and a resource
for the community, my goal is to make this a website.
Exactly how I do this has yet to be decided, perhaps as
a wiki, but probably as a more structured site. I also
hope to include both student and professor reviews of
each item, but that is long term. If you are willing
to make a recommendation, please send it to me (sm-
ccaﬀe@wheatonma.edu), specifying which topic and/or
subheading within a topic your suggestion falls, and
whether or not you want to have your name associated
with it on the web site by designating anonymous or
recommender. Again, the student audience is an upper
level (junior/ senior) undergraduate course for science
majors. Thanks in advance, and I look forward to all
your recommendations.

work. I need to study the evolution of oxidative stress
response in *Drosophila melanogaster *using the ROS-
generating herbicide Paraquat*.* I have looked into
several literatures but couldnt ﬁnd which Paraquat to
use as two types are available in the market, Paraquat
dichloride and Paraquat tetrahydroxide. It would be
of great help if you can answer my querry as soon as
possible.

answers
Dear all,
I have received a number of useful answers to my ques-
tion regarding the breaking up of alignments based on
a sequence distance threshold (see my original question
below this message) which I will summarise below.
Two programs were suggested independently by a num-
ber of people. These programs are usually employed for
analysing communities of soil organisms, and can divide
sequences into clusters based on a similarity measure
threshold set by the user:
1. Robin Floyd and Simon Creer both kindly pointed
me towards the Perl script MOTU deﬁne, which can be
found on the website of Mark Blaxters lab at the uni-
versity of Edingburgh ( http://www.nematodes.org/-
bioinformatics/MOTU/index.shtml ). MOTU deﬁne
uses blast-based similarity matching, and single link-
age clustering.
2. Sujeevan Ratnasingham, Simon Creer and Richard
Waterman suggested the program Dotur, by Patrick
Schloss from the university of Massachusetts ( http:/-
/schloss.micro.umass.edu/software/dotur.html ).
However, this program has recently been incorporated
in the new open source, expandible software Mothur
(http://schloss.micro.umass.edu/mothur/Main Page)
which can do many cool things, including sequence
clustering. It allows you to choose between single
linkage (nearest neighbor), complete linkage (furthest
neighbor) and average linkage (average neighbor /
UPGMA) clustering methods.
In addition, Lee Taylor suggested using the genome as-
sembly program Cap3 (Lee Taylor).
I hope this may help anyone else interested in sequence
clustering.
Best,
Robin van Velzen

distances?September 1, 2009 EvolDir 51
Dear EvolDir members,
I have a large ( >500 individuals) partial COI DNA se-
quence alignment which I would like to break up into
subsets based on a pairwise sequence distance thresh-
old. For example: break up the alignment into subsets
containing individuals with <10% pairwise sequence
distance. Ideally, I would want to do this without hav-
ing to produce a distance tree.
Does anyone know of a program or script that could do
this for me?
Any suggestions are most welcome.
Thanks!

Phylogenetics software
recommendation
Can someone recommend a free basic phylogenet-
ics software to construct a species tree? I tried
TREEFINDER that had been announced on this list
but could not get it to work either on Windows 2000
Pro or XP Pro. A screen would momentarily ﬂash when
I clicked on the executable ﬁle, but nothing else came
up. I am interested in doing just some simple simula-
tions using imaginary characteristics. If the genealogi-
cal relationships in a tree that is built by some of the
current free software is dependent on speciﬁc molecular
sequences, that would be a problem for what I want to
do.

Stan Gorodenski <stanlep@commspeed.net >Plant Fuzzy-Set-Ordination
Hello,
I have a matrix with 180 plant species (variables, bi-
nary) and 270 rows (altitude waterbodies). There is
also one categorical variable (4 categories representing
similar lakes groups, which resulted from a prior analy-
sis of the transposed matrix). Is there any way to load
plant species on those categories in fuzzy-set-ordination
analysis? Is there anyone here that has faced this ques-
tion before or could provide a hint? All my eﬀorts so
farhave lead to loading the lakes on the categories (fso
in R); but I want to load the plant species.
I would greatly appreciate your help.

Quantify DNA answers
Thanks to all who shared their preferences on quanti-
fying DNA.
My original question was:
Dear colleagues,
Which kind of instrument do you prefer to use to quan-
tify DNA for use
in sequencing? I have used the NanoDrop from
Thermo, but was wondering
if anyone has something else that you use.
The most popular answer was the Qubit from Invit-
rogen. It is a ﬂuorescence-based instrument that uses
solutions that you add to your sample and measure,
either on a plate reader or on their small footprint ﬂu-
orometer.
“The ﬂuorometer uses an intercalating dye to bind to
the DNA and then ﬂuoresces when excited. This means
that unlike the spectro based machines, the reading re-
ﬂects only the DNA present in the sample and is not
inﬂuenced by non-DNA which can inﬂuence the read-
ing of a spec-based machine. For accuracy, I think the
ﬂuorometer is hard to beat.”
Others said they run their samples on an agarose gel,
and compare band intensity to a sample of “known”
concentration. They needed to make sure they had a
PCR product anyway, and with practice is an easy way
to “quantify.”
I knew about the pitfalls of UV/Vis measurements, butwhen the NanoDrop came along, its ease of use out-
weighed the problems. Now it sounds like the Qubit
kits have made ﬂuorescent measurements easier, so it
is certainly worth consideration.
Thank you all for your help,

Rana perezi paper
Dear evoldir members,
I am looking for a paper by Balletto and colaborators
on the presence of Rana perezi in Madeira. This paper
was published in 1990 but I do not know in which jour-
nal. I do not have the exact reference because they are
mentioned in a book that I have not access to. Part of
this book is available on the web but not the exact ref-
erence. I have tried to look for it through the internet
but nothing comes out.
Apparently, these authors have used genetic data to
claim that R. perezi arrived in the island 400,000 years
ago. They are the only ones to make such a claim and
wondered whether they misinterpreted the genetic data.
Thank you in advance for any help Hopefully something
will come out if this. best wishes Joao Alves

Scitable and evolution
The Nature Publishing Group has launched a new di-
vision called Nature Education, which produces Sc-
itable ( http://www.nature.com/scitable ), a new FREE
resource for undergraduate education in the Life Sci-
ences. Currently, Scitable provides content on genetics.
Two of the topic areas within Genetics are “Population
and Quantitative Genetics” and “Evolutionary Genet-
ics.”
We are very grateful to those members of the commu-
nity who have contributed the articles that allowed us
to launch Scitable. As Scitable continues to develop,
we are seeking additional content articles (1,000-2,000
words) that provide concise overviews of topics in evolu-
tionary genetics. Ideally, the article would cite primary
literature that can be provided to users as full-text.
Through Scitable, full-text articles of Nature titles (Na-
ture, Nature Genetics, etc.) are frequently made avail-
able alongside links to open-access journals.
While all ideas are welcome, for the Population and
Evolutionary Genetics areas we are especially seeking
articles that deal with conservation and ecological ge-
netics, applications of population and quantitative ge-
netics, the coalescent, statistical tests of neutrality and
other hypotheses, genome evolution, and evo-devo.
If you have ideas relating to the organization of Scitable
and/or wish to contribute, please contact Rich Kliman
(rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu). We would be grateful if
you would bring this invitation to the attention of col-
leagues who may not subscribe to EvolDir.
We also seek instructors who will help us with beta-
testing. In addition to content that links to full-text
journal articles, Scitable allows instructors to set up
classroom pages that host course material. These class-
room pages can be used to host a combination of the
instructor’s own course materials and supplemental Sc-
itable articles. In Fall 2009, Scitable will be oﬀering new
course readings called “Essentials in Genetics”, that in-
clude explanations of key genetics concepts supported
by animations and interactive media. In addition to
a variety of supplemental course content, Scitable pro-
vides a social media space for both faculty and students
that includes chat tools and discussion forums.

SouthAfrica Volunteers
SmallMammalEvolution
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
>From December 2009 onwards
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons of group living, paternal care, communal nesting
and social ﬂexibility in the striped mouse. As this
species is diurnal and the habitat is open, direct be-
havioral observations in the ﬁeld are possible.What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld; maintenance of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 90 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. For students with their
own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250 (ap-
prox. 110 Euro) per month applies. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
2000 or 170 Euro/month). Including extras, you should
expect costs of about 300 Euros per month. Students
get an invitation letter which they can use to apply for
funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany,
SANW in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
volunteers to start in December 2009. Volunteers who
want to start later in 2010 can also apply now. Volun-
teers are expected to stay at least 2 months, but longer
periods of up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch.

WORKING AS A FIELD ASSISTANT IN GOEGAP
NATURE RESERVE
A report by Romy H¨ oppli, student at the University of
Zurich, who staid in Goegap June to August 2008
Blue skies without a single cloud for six weeks - rocky
mountains with little vegetation - yellow, orange and
pink ﬁelds of ﬂowers in whatever direction you look
- small mammals, lizards and birds in our front yard
and Mountain Zebras, Springbok and Ostrich right next
door...
This was my time at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-
tion in Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa! During
six weeks from the beginning of July until the middle of
August I’ve been living here, studying mice, experienc-
ing nature like never before and being part of a small
community where there was always something to laugh
and joke about!
After arriving in Goegap, right the next morning my
scientiﬁc adventure in South Africa began: Setting and
checking traps, nest observations and radio-tracking
were our daily routine. While I got bitten by the mice
quite often in the beginning and my right middle ﬁn-
ger was scarred all over, I improved quickly shaking the
mice out of the traps, weighing them and checking the
number of the ear tag. Other duties like cleaning thecages of the mice in the captive colony, washing the dirt
from probably several months out of the traps, paint-
ing the new Wendy House and putting in a ﬂoor and
curtains quickly added to our daily ﬁeld work activities.
It was never boring in Goegap! There was always some-
thing to do:

Postdoctoral project: Genome analysis of a degenerate
asexual tetraploid ˆ a the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga./
/ /
Selection of candidates for a postdoctoral grant to sub-
mit to the Belgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientiﬁque
(FNRS) by Sept. 15 ^th 2009. This FNRS-sponsored
postdoctoral position is requested by Karine Van Don-
inck (University of Namur ˆ a FUNDP, Belgium) to-
gether with the postdoctoral candidate to participate
in the project on the forthcoming availability by Geno-
scope of the ﬁrst assembled whole genome sequence of
the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga/.
Rotifers of Class Bdelloidea are remarkable in hav-
ing evolved for millions of years, apparently without
males and meiosis and therefore termed an “evolution-
ary scandal” by John Maynard Smith. Sequencing the
genome of the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga/ will make
it the ﬁrst representative of the Phylum Rotifera and
of the early branching triploblasts to which it belongs.
The availability of their genome sequence will also fa-
cilitate further tests investigating the genomic conse-
quences of long-term evolution without meiosis and
conﬁrm their status of degenerate tetraploid.
The genome sequencing project of /A.vaga/ has startedand therefore a researcher with a strong background in
Bioinformatics and in genomics is requested to start in
January 2010. The postdoctoral candidate will work
with Karine Van Doninck at the University of Namur
(Belgium) and Olivier Jaillon at the Genoscope ˆ a CEA
(Paris, France) and will participate in the interpreta-
tion of the annotated genome, especially with respect to
the evolutionary and biological characteristics of bdel-
loid rotifers.
The FRFC Belgian non-taxable postdoctoral fellowship
can be for 2 or 3 years with a maximum salary of 37.000
euro/year.
To be eligible the candidate should have the following
characteristics:
- did not reside or work in Belgium during 24 months
the last 3 years
- obtained his PhD less then 6 years ago
- has a strong publication record
Recent publications include:

EvolutionaryGenomics
Postdoc: Genome Evolution
A post-doctoral position in genome evolution is avail-
able in the Biology Department at Colorado State
University. The successful candidate will use 454
data to study the mutational processes underlying
extreme genomic expansion in plethodontid salaman-
ders. Plethodontids have among the largest vertebrate
genomes from 15 to 75 Gb. Although such genomes
are known to consist largely of repetitive DNA, the re-
peat elements, their mutational dynamics, and the ways
in which these dynamics translate into large and vari-
able genome sizes remain almost completely uncharac-
terized. The goal of our project is to generate large-
scale genomic data from numerous species of plethod-
ontids and analyze the tempo and mode of novel repeat
element evolution in a phylogenetic context. Such ge-
nomic analyses will be combined with ongoing compar-
ative methods-based analyses of plethodontid genome
size evolution.
A Ph.D. in evolutionary or comparative genomics, or in
a closely-related ﬁeld, is required by the position start-
date. The successful candidate will be expected to in-
teract with the CSU Center for Bioinformatics as well as
graduate and undergraduate students and post-docs in
our growing lab group. This project is being conducted
in collaboration with the UC Denver-based Consortium
for Comparative Genomics, directed by David Pollock;
the successful candidate will interact with both the Pol-
lock lab group and the Consortium on data collection
and analysis.
The Department of Biology at Colorado State Univer-
sity is an interdisciplinary group with a strong crew
of evolutionary biologists. CSU is heavily oriented to-
wards life sciences. In addition to the Department of
Biology in the College of Natural Sciences, CSU has
four other colleges dedicated to life science research:
Applied Human Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Veteri-
nary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, and the Warner
College of Natural Resources. In addition, the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, the United States
Department of Agriculture, and the United States Ge-
ological Survey have active laboratories in Fort Collins.
Fort Collins is a beautiful city of 120,000 people located
at the base of the Rocky Mountains. We enjoy easy ac-
cess to world-class outdoor recreation and 300+ days
of sunshine each year.
The position is available as soon as a suitable candidate
is identiﬁed. Start-date is negotiable.
For full consideration, materials must be received
no later than Friday, September 18, 2009. However,
applications will be accepted until the position is ﬁlled.

GoettingenU SymbiosisEvolution
The “Geomicrobiology and Symbiosis” junior research
group ( http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/102704.html
) in the Courant Research Centre Geobiology at the
University of Goettingen invites applications for a post-
doctoral position, starting on December 1, 2009.
*Topic*: Chemoautotrophic symbioses have evolved
independently in diverse animal and bacterial phyla
and are ubiquitous in marine environments such as
deep-sea hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and shallow
organic-rich sediments. Recently, the ﬁrst example of a
terrestrial chemoautotrophic symbiosis was discovered
in the sulﬁde- rich limestone caves of Frasassi, Italy
(Dattagupta, S. et al. The ISME Journal, 3, 935-943).
This symbiosis is likely to have evolved less than one
million years ago, making it tens to millions of years
younger than its marine counterparts. It could thus
provide valuable insight into the initiation and early60 EvolDir September 1, 2009
evolution of chemoautotrophic symbioses. The study
will investigate factors contributing to host- recognition
and speciﬁcity, as well as mechanisms enabling domi-
nance of the symbiotic phylotype in its host environ-
ment.
*Requirements*: Applicants must be ﬂuent in English
and have completed a Ph.D. in Geomicrobiology, Mi-
crobial Ecology or a closely related ﬁeld. They must be
competent with classical (bacterial isolation) and mod-
ern molecular methods for microbial analyses; experi-
ence with pyrosequencing, genomics, and bioinformat-
ics is a plus. Fieldwork experience and at minimum, an
interest in cave exploration, is desired. International
applicants are welcome. The University of Goettingen
seeks to increase the participation of women in areas in
which they are currently underrepresented and there-
fore explicitly urges women to apply. Disabled persons
with equivalent aptitude will be favoured.
*Employment*: We oﬀer a two-year Postdoc position
with the possibility of extension to three years. Post-
doc salary is based on the German TV-L system, level
13.
*Environment*: Goettingen is a quaint and traditional
German university town with an international student-
based community. The Courant Research Centre is one
of seven interdisciplinary research centres ( www.uni-
goettingen.de/crc ) recently established by Goettingen
University. The Centre oﬀers a wide range of state-
of-the-art analytical facilities and an excellent environ-
ment for interdisciplinary research.
*Application (Deadline: October 1, 2009)*: Candi-
dates should send a curriculum vita and a statement
of research interests by email to Dr. Sharmishtha
Dattagupta (sdattag@uni-goettingen.de). They should
also arrange for two reference letters to be sent *di-
rectly* by the referees before the deadline.

Postdoctoral Fellowship - Harvard University
Bdelloid Genetic Transfer and Population Structure
An NSF-sponsored postdoctoral position is available in
the laboratory of Matthew Meselson at Harvard Univer-
sity in Cambridge Massachusetts for the investigation
of homologous genetic transfer in natural populations
of bdelloid rotifers.
Although lacking males and any form of sexual repro-
duction and therefore termed an “evolutionary scan-
dal” by John Maynard Smith, our recent observations
indicate that bdelloids do, after all, engage in homolo-
gous genetic transfer, thereby apparently resolving the
challenge posed by bdelloids to the view that long-term
evolutionary success requires some form of mixis. The
population structure within which such transfer occurs,
however, appears to be highly unusual and its mecha-
nism remains to be elucidated.
The fellowship project entails collection of bdelloid ro-
tifers from sites in northeast United States; sequenc-
ing of mitochondrial genes to identify mitochondrial
clades; DNA sequencing at loci on several chromosomes
of bdelloids within the same clade; characterization of
the parameters of homologous genetic transfer; and the
development and testing of models of bdelloid genetic
transfer and population structure to explain the obser-
vations obtained. Certain aspects of the work will be
facilitated by the forthcoming availability of the ﬁrst
annotated whole genome sequence of a bdelloid rotifer.The position requires an individual with a strong back-
ground in DNA sequencing and computational analysis
and in population genetics theory who is committed to
attacking and solving fundamental problems in biology.

RiceU DictyosteliumSocialEvolution

Cooperation and conﬂict in the social amoeba Dic-
tyostelium discoideum
An NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available im-
mediately in the laboratories of Joan Strassmann and
David Queller for research on the social amoeba Dic-
tyostelium discoideum.
Dictyostelium amoebae, when starved, aggregate into
a multicellular body in which about a ﬁfth of the cells
altruistically die to support and help disperse the re-
maining cells as living spores. Since the multicellular
body can be made up of genetically diﬀerent clones,
there are opportunities for conﬂict. The social amoeba
is fast becoming a model organism of choice for inves-
tigations into the evolution of cooperation and conﬂict,
and particularly for studies of these traits and the ge-
netic and genomic level. There are sequenced genomes
for two species of Dictyostelium, and quite a few more
are underway in our group, including close relatives and
resequencing of multiple clones of D. discoideum. Lab-
oratory manipulations, experimental evolution, and ge-
nomic work is feasible and likely to answer important
questions.
The person who ﬁlls this position will investigate social
interactions using some of our unique resources such as
a large pool of insertional mutants, wild clones, genomic
data, and the wonderful ease of social experimentation
in a microbial system.
We are looking for a highly motivated and ambi-
tious researcher with experience in molecular, micro-
bial, and/or genomic computational techniques who is
interested in empirical research on this exciting system,
and in joining a dynamic and fun group of smart, highly
motivated, productive, and hard working researchers in
one of the great cities of the USA. The ideal candidate
will have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology or a related
ﬁeld and experience with working with microorganisms
in an evolutionary framework. Knowledge of computer
programming, such as UNIX and a scripting language
such as Perl or Ruby are not required but would be a
plus.
Publications on the system from our group include the
following. Others can be found at the group website
(www.ruf.rice.edu/˜evolve ).

the world outside of its native range due to acciden-
tal or deliberate introductions by humans. The South
African population of this species originated from cap-
tive birds that escaped in Durban in 1902. A cen-
tury later, the common myna has become abundant
throughout much of South Africa and is considered to
pose a serious threat to indigenous biodiversity. This
species has signiﬁcant potential to spread further in
southern Africa as populations are expanding north
into Limpopo, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and west and
south-west into the Free State and Eastern Cape.
Except for the occasional documentation of their overall
distribution range, very little is known about the gen-
eral movement dynamics of mynas. Using molecular
techniques and ecological principals, this project will
investigate questions related to common mynas focus-
ing on (i) the spatial distribution of genetic variation,
(ii) movement patterns in relation to certain landscape
variables, (iii) factors aﬀecting the relationship between
genetic diversity and gene ﬂow, (iv) source and sink
populations, and (v) the distance decay of genetic sim-
ilarity and gene ﬂow.
Fieldwork will be conducted across the full distribution
range of the common myna in South Africa. Work will
be conducted in conjunction with the University of Pre-
toria and Stellenbosch University and time will there-
fore be spend at both universities. Field experience
working with birds and a strong molecular background
is an advantage.

UManchester PhylogeneticModeling
Project: The Evolutionary Fate of Gene Duplicates PI:
Simon Whelan, University of Manchester, UK
How organisms acquire new genes with novel func-
tions remains an open question. One major mecha-
nism is through diﬀerential fates of gene duplicates,
whereby duplicate copies acquire new functions (neo-
functionalisation) or segregate existing function (sub-
functionalisation). Our ability to identify gene fate is
hindered by the limited computational tools available.
This project will develop new tools and use them study
well characterized gene duplication events.
This computational project is based in the Bioinformat-
ics and Evolutionary research groupings at the Faculty
of Life Sciences. During the project you will design
novel phylogenetic substitution models that allow for
heterogeneous evolution and may discriminate between
neo- and sub-functionalisation. You will implement
the models in a computer program and apply them to
the yeast whole genome duplication. Prior experience
in phylogenetic methods, computer programming (e.g.
C/C++; Java), yeast genomics, or some combination
thereof is desirable.

Post-doctoral Fellow’ Department of Fisheries and
Wildlife and Division of Biological Sciences, University
of Missouri (Columbia, MO)
As part of an NSF-supported study examining the im-
portance of genetic variability for predicting the like-
lihood of wildlife infection by diverse parasites, we
seek a post-doctoral researcher to provide the concep-
tual advances needed to better understand how neu-
tral genetic variability and MHC loci variability predict
the likelihood of infection of wildlife by diverse micro
and macroparasites. Parasites are typically aggregated
among hosts, with some individuals more likely to be in-
fected than others or bearing greater parasite burdens.
This likelihood of an individual being parasitized can
be predicted from characteristics of the host (e.g. age,
sex) as well as the place the host inhabits and the tim-
ing of the sampling of the host. The genetic variability
of the host may also contribute to the likelihood and
severity of infection, but the importance of this relative
to other predictors of parasitism is unclear.
We have accrued a large dataset on raccoons (ca 700
individuals) and their parasites (ectoparasites, nema-
todes, and microparasites) and are working to better
understand the disease ecology of this system. The
postdoctoral fellow will oversee laboratory genetic anal-
yses of the raccoons, with particular emphasis on ana-
lyzing MHC variability and understanding whether this
variability, as well as the presence of speciﬁc MHC alle-
les, helps predict the likelihood and extent of parasitism
as well as the parasite community of a host individual.
Opportunities may exist for further ﬁeld work as well
as involvement in other projects of mutual interest.
The position is currently open and can be ﬁlled imme-
diately. Funding for the position is available for two
years.
The successful candidate will demonstrate a strong
work ethic, an interest in both theoretical and applied
ecology, strong laboratory and quantitative skills, and
a demonstrated commitment to publication of results

Postdoctoral Positions in Molecular Evolution at the
IEB:
Highly motivated individuals are sought for the follow-
ing projects:
Project/Position 1 (Computational): MODULAR
EVOLUTION OF PROTEINS BY DOMAIN AR-
RANGEMENTS (Ref EBB-09PD02-DOM):
Proteins evolve, to a large extent, by modular rear-
rangements of conserved functional units. We aim at
using and, where necessary developing, algorithms to
reconstruct the evolutionary scenarios of modular ar-
rangements, to rapidly identify homologous proteins
and analysing genome evolution in terms of modu-
lar rearrangements. Post-holders will build on earlier
research by investigating the rearrangements in ver-
tebrates, arthropods and by participation in several
genome projects. In particular we aim to understand
how newly arising domain arrangements after a gene
duplication become selectively advantagous, e.g. by
speciﬁc loss of domains or optimising suboptimal func-
tions.
See: AD Moore et al. Arrangements in the modular
evolution of proteins, Trends in Biochem Sci, 33:09,
2008 (and references therein)

ogist with a strong interest in evolution and a wide
range of experimental skills in order to investigate the
inﬂuence of functional promiscouity (enzymes with dual
function) on the evolvability of new, previously latent

MuseumDNAanalysis
Postdoc position in molecular biology / DNA isolation
from museum specimens
Two postdoc positions are available at Wageningen
University, Netherlands (28 months) and the Museum
of Natural History Berlin, Germany (30 months) condi-
tional to approval by the funding agency. The project
is part of a 4 year Joint Research Activity within the
SYNTHESYS2 programme funded by the European
Union FP7 and aims at developing eﬃcient DNA isola-
tion methods for the analysis of museum specimens and
will be integrated within a larger programme involving
ancient bone studies.September 1, 2009 EvolDir 83
Museum collections constitute a DNA archive allow-
ing us to explore genetic diversity in specimens over
the last 250 years. They are increasingly exploited as
ancient DNA repositories for DNA based systematic
and ecological studies, and represent years of collect-
ing eﬀorts, often in diﬃcult, complex and remote re-
gions, such as tropical rain forests, or ones that have
since been disturbed/ distroyed by human action. The
potential for high-throughput automated DNA extrac-
tion coupled with recent innovations in DNA sequenc-
ing technology (e.g., miniaturisation, pyrosequencing)
has highlighted the need for eﬃcient methods for re-
covering high quality DNA from historical specimens
for both evolutionary and diagnostic studies.
We are looking for two postdoctoral researchers with
experience with techniques in molecular biology, es-
pecially the extraction of DNA from animal and
plant/fungal tissues. The successful candidates should
have a good background or keen interest in the
(bio)chemistry of ancient museum specimen DNA
preservation, a good understanding of current system-
atic research practice, as well as of data basing. Good
communication skills, the ability to work independently
and to interact with diﬀerent taxonomist/museum com-
munities are prerequisites.
The two projects involve the following:
Plants/fungi (Wageningen)
P Identify the main obstacles to successful DNA ex-
traction/ ampliﬁcation from herbarium specimens.
P Optimise protocols for DNA extraction from old ( >70
yr), alcohol- preserved, or secondary metabolite-rich
herbarium specimens of a wide range of plants and fun-
gal clades, with a view to enabling subsequent large-
scale and high-throughput automation of DNA extrac-
tion from herbarium material.P Assessment of post-mortem damage in old herbarium
specimens using next-generation sequencing
Invertebrates with muco-polysaccharide rich tissue
(Berlin)
P Develop and test safer and more eﬀective DNA iso-
lation procedure from muco-polysaccharide-rich tissue,
mainly molluscs, focussing on museum specimens of
varying age (5-150 years).
Both projects involve the setup of a web database as
an eﬃcient tool to disseminate protocols and user ex-
periences.
We oﬀer an intellectually stimulating research environ-
ment in some of Europes largest natural history muse-
ums with well-equipped state-of- the-art lab facilities,
and with partnerships in leading molecular systematic
labs in the Netherlands, the UK and Denmark.
The position at oﬀer at the Museum of Natural His-
tory Berlin will be full time at salary level IIa BAT-O
(Anwendungstarifvertrag HU Berlin). The Museum of
Natural History Berlin is an equal opportunities em-
ployer, applications by qualiﬁed women are particularly
encouraged. Severely disabled applicants with equal
qualiﬁcation will be given preference. The position at

examples of the need and uses of giving species a name,
and organising them into systems of classiﬁcation.
The introductory overview will review uncertainty in
the numbers of species on Earth and their extinction
rates, and survey how resulting problems can be ad-
dressed for eﬀective conservation action. Following
lectures will highlight the importance of taxonomy to
fungi, forensics, invertebrates, and control of illegal use
of endangered species. In the ﬁnal session a panel of
experts will review how the next generation of natural-
ists can be inspired and discuss how to encourage more
people to enter the ﬁeld of taxonomy, where there is a
critical shortage.

Unique (and Low-Cost) Opportunity for Ten Under-
graduates 2010 Ecological Genetics Field Study Abroad
in China
*Learn Chinese and Ecological Genetics at the Unver-
sity of Georgia*
With funding from NSF’s Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, we
are oﬀering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens or perma-
nent residents only) the opportunity to participate in a
unique study abroad opportunity in China during the
spring and summer of 2010. This is the 3rd year of the
program and students have found it to be enormously
rewarding.
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic bio-
geographic study of species that are native to China
and invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a grow-
ing number of species native to the southeastern U.S.
and invasive in China.
Each summer, we run an 8 week ﬁeld course where we
visit biological communities throughout China. After
the ﬁeld course, students can elect to continue in short-
term (3-week) research internships in our partner labs
in China.
Students will need to be prepared to take full advan-
tage of this experience. Therefore, during the spring
semester, students must enroll at the University of
Georgia (UGA) and take 3 courses; two in intensive
elementary Mandarin Chinese and a laboratory course
in genetics. No prior experience with Chinese language
is required, although students should have had at least
a course in introductory biology and preferably courses
in ecology and evolutionary biology.
The cost to the student of the summer program is mini-
mal: the grant covers travel to and within China, lodg-
ing and most meals. The student is responsible for
health insurance, visa costs and personal expenses. Stu-
dents are also responsible for the costs of enrolling at
the University of Georgia for all required courses (12
credit hours) (all students are charged at the in-state
tuition rate of ~$250 per credit hour plus fees).
The deadline for applications is October 16, 2009.86 EvolDir September 1, 2009
Applications for the 2010 program are available
on our website: http://www.genetics.uga.edu/pire/-
undergrad.html . We encourage any interested students
to contact Dr. Mauricio for more information (mauri-
cio@uga.edu).

BayesianStatsForEvolution
Bayesian statistics: An introduction to multilevel mod-
els and the R package MCMCglmm (7-9 October 2009)
Bayesian statistics become increasingly important in
the ﬁeld of evolutionary biology and particularly for
analyses involving multilevel and/or hierarchical mod-
els such as those used in comparative studies and in
animal models. The aim of this workshop is to give an
introduction to the use of Bayesian statistics as an al-
ternative to other statistical approaches for hierarchical
modeling (e.g. maximum likelihood). The statistical
package MCMCglmm for R was created by Dr Jarrod
Hadﬁeld and Dr Loeske Kruuk and published at the
beginning of 2009. This package is a useful and pow-
erful tool based on Bayesian statistics for all scientists
interested in multi-level/hierarchical models applied in
many diﬀerent ﬁelds of evolutionary biology. During
this 3-day workshop, Dr Hadﬁeld will introduce the
participants to (1) the basics of glmm and MCMC, (2)
multivariate and random regressions and (3) the use of
MCMCglmm with pedigrees and phylogenies. Partici-
pants need to have a basic knowledge of statistics and
Bayesian methods and of the programming language R.
The course is free and is be open to a maximum of 25
participants selected by order of registration.

The University of Washington is developing a suite of
online versions of its graduate courses in statistical ge-
netics. A general biostatistics course, BIOST 511, is
oﬀered by Dr. Jim Hughes in the Fall quarter (October
- December). Statistical Genetics I: Population Genet-
ics is oﬀered by Dr. Elizabeth Thompson in the Spring
quarter (April-June). Dr. Bruce Weir will oﬀer Statis-
tical Genetics II: Quantitative Genetics in the Fall of
2009 (October - December). Details on this course andhow to register for three hours of graduate-level credit
can be obtained from him at bsweir@u.washington.edu
Statistical Genetics II covers the distribution of al-
lele frequencies across populations (e.g. Holsinger and
Weir “Genetics in geographically structured popula-
tions: deﬁning, estimating and interpreting FST” Na-
ture Reviews Genetics 10:639-650, 2009); Continuous
variation and the partitioning of variance and covari-
ance among relatives, estimation of heritabilty (e.g.
Visscher “Whole genome approaches to quantitative ge-
netics” Genetica 136:351-358, 2009); QTL and associa-
tion mapping for quantitative traits (e.g. Weir “Link-
age diseequilibrium and association mapping” Annual
Review of Genomics and Human Genetics 9:129-142,
2008). Current topics such as that described by Hill,
Goddard and Visscher (“Data and theory point to
mainly additive genetic variance for complex traits”

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected90 EvolDir September 1, 2009
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
