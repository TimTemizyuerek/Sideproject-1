Beijing Phylogeography Aug23-27
Dear All,
A conference symposium on phylogeography
has been planned for the XIXth International
Congress of Zoology (ICZ 2004, Section 1.2),
which will be held in Beijing on 23-27 August
2004 (see website http://www.icz.ioz.ac.cn/second/-
second announcement v3.html for more information
about registration, etc.). Dr. John Avise will come
to give a congress plenary lecture. The symposium
“Phylogeography: Principles and Practice” intends
to provide an opportunity for scientists studying all
animal groups (vertebrates and invertebrates) and
all aspects of phylogeographical research (theoretical,
applied or methodological) to communicate and discusstheir most recent ﬁndings and results. The end of
August is the start of the best time for visiting Beijing
and other part of China. The congress has arranged
several attractive excursions in Beijing and trips to
other interesting places in China (including Xi’an for
the terracotta army, Guilin for the most beautiful
natural stone forest, Lasa for characteristic Tibetan
beauty).
Limited funds will be available for assisting interna-
tional delegates who are unable to obtain full support
for attending the ICZ 2004: particular consideration
will be given to graduate and postgraduate students,
and participants from developing countries. Both oral
and poster presentations are welcome. Participants
who intend to give oral presentations are invited to sub-
mit a mini-paper not more than 2000 words (including
tables, no ﬁgures; Arial, Size 11). Contributors should
please send the electronic version of their mini-paper or
poster abstract to the scientiﬁc committee of ICZ 2004
(Prof. Dehua Wang, E-mail: wangdh@panda.ioz.ac.cn)
indicating the symposium name or the symposium or-
ganizer (Godfrey M. Hewitt: g.hewitt@uea.ac.uk or De-

SCOPE
The focus of this symposium is on the relationship be-
tween evolvability and interaction in biology, robotics
and software systems. Evolvability is the capacity of
populations to support heritable variability and diﬀer-
ential success, as in organic, memetic or artiﬁcal evo-
lutionary systems. Interaction between entities (large
or small populations of cells, individuals, units of selec-
tion, social agents: animals, humans, robots, software)
is the background for and is harnessed by evolutionary
processes. This can result in adaptation to the presence
of others via signalling and perception, communication,
and exploiting the dynamics of social interaction.
In humans, other primates, dolphins, corvid, parrots,
and other species interaction and social complexity have
evolved that exploit mechanisms of recognition of par-
ticular individuals, life-long learning, autobiographical
and interaction memory, development of social relation-
ships, and complex forms of social learning and com-
munication. Other animals exhibit interactive signal-
ing systems (e.g. aﬀect, threat and courtship displays),
whereas within multicellular organisms and insect soci-
eties the substrates of interactions exploit chemical and
stigmergic signals, or cell-type and caste roles.
TOPICS OF INTEREST
- evolution of evolvability in populations of interacting
individuals - animal social complexity - the behaviour
of communicating and signaling - aﬀordances and ecolo-
gies of interaction - animal social networks and kinds of
social minds - evolvability issues in computation and in-

The Chatham Islands: an emergent ark?
The Chatham Islands and their biota have long been
thought to be of ancient origin. But, new evidence
suggests that the Chatham Islands may have existed
for as little as 4 million years. Imagine no land there
whatsoever. The biological signiﬁcance of this idea is
so profound that it demands scientiﬁc scrutiny.
If veriﬁed, then the arrival and establishment of all
land-dwelling plants and animals in the Chatham Is-lands has been rapid, and in biological terms, recent.
This concept has major implications for understand-
ing rates and mechanisms of dispersal and colonization
over large distances, speciation, biodiversity of oceanic
islands and the biological history of New Zealand.
The proposed research will involve geological and bio-
logical studies. It will be detective, searching for criti-
cal geological evidence of two major processes: sea level
change and tectonic uplift. Biological research will com-
pare DNA sequences from selected Chatham Islands
and mainland plants and animal to explore the timing,
pattern and ecological consequences of colonization and
isolation.
This project will involve geologists and biologists work-
ing together from GNS and Massey, Otago and Lin-
coln universities. It has the potential to establish new8 EvolDir October 1, 2003
ways to determine island histories, rates of dispersal
and rates of speciation.
I seek a PhD candidate to develop and undertake a
molecular ecology project to study the relationships and
diversity of Chathams Island animals and their coun-
terparts in New Zealand. The object of the programme
is to examine patterns of molecular and morpholog-
ical evolution within the context of a known age of
the Chathams Islands. The research will be primarily
laboratory based applying a range of molecular, stys-
tematics, population genetics and phylogenetics tech-
niques, to a range of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa
and may utilise ancient DNA techniques. You will need
to be prepared to participate in several ﬁeld trips to
the Chathams Islands and regions of mainland New
Zealand, to interact eﬀectively with a large multidis-
ciplinary team and with staﬀ of relevant institutions
that may provide additional study material. Experi-
ence with laboratory techniques would be an asset but
is not essential, although you will need to demonstrate
some aptitude for the meticulous methods required for
this work. Other experience and interest in other areas
including biogeography, ecology, taxonomy and compu-
tation would be advantageous.
Feel free to contact me to discuss the programme in
more detail. Closing date 31 December 2003.

Dear All, we are advertising for a new PhD-student to

PhD studentship in Ecology, Plant Ecology and Sys-
tematics
Life history, ecophysiology, and the success of clonal
weeds
A four-year PhD studentship in Plant Ecology and Sys-
tematics, funded by the Faculty of Science, Lund Uni-
versity, is available at the Section for plant Ecology and
Systematics, Department of Ecology, Lund University,
Sweden, to study ﬁtness consequences of physiological
integration and morphology in a highly invasive clonal
plant species.
Background: By adopting a life history-based frame-
work that concentrates on trade-oﬀs and their physio-
logical background, this project aims to identify traits
important for invasive clonal weeds. Ground elder, Ae-
gopodium podagraria, has successfully colonised a wide
range of cultivated lands in Sweden, and is consideredone of the worst weeds in northern Europe. However,
very little is known about its life history traits and how
these enable the plant to be a successful weed. One yet
untested hypothesis is that resource storage combined
with clonal splitting allows successful establishment of
new modules. The degree to which this interacts with
invasiveness, life histories, and overall genetic variabil-
ity is currently unknown.
Goals: Populations from southern and northern Scan-
dinavia (where the species reaches its northern distribu-
tion limit) will be tested for diﬀerences in morphological
traits, physiological integration and the occurrence of
stored resources. Based on these data, the project aims
to determine 1) the importance of storage and resource
sharing for population establishment and persistence,
2) developing molecular markers and determining the
degree of genetic variation within and between focal
populations, and 3) variation in morphological traits
between and within focal populations.
Key traits associated with weediness in this species
will be identiﬁed using ﬁeld experiments and common-
garden techniques where weedy Aegopodium poda-
graria populations are compared with typical native
populations found in deciduous forests.
The duties of the PhD position also include (up to 10%)
undergraduate teaching and a certain amount of admin-
istration.
We are looking for a candidate with a B.Sc. degree (or
equivalent) in biology or a related subject, and a strong
interest in plant ecology, ecophysiology and molecular
ecology. Good skills in written English is a prerequi-
site, and a driverslicence is necessary for the ﬁeld work.
Social skills to function in a group of researchers is im-
portant.
Starting date: as soon as possible
The application should be written using a
form found on the Faculty website http://-
www.naturvetenskap.lu.se/fou/antagn blankett.pdf
The application, marked with reference number 515,
should be sent to Registrator, Administration Oﬃce,
Lund University, Box 118, SE-221 00 Lund, Swedenno
later than September 22, 2003. The application
should include a signed and witnessed CV, a list of
publications, and witnessed copies of exam certiﬁcates.

Molecular ecology Phd scholarship in New Zealand
(available to New Zealand residents, and Australian,
French and German nationals).
I seek a PhD candidate to develop and undertake a
molecular ecology project to study the relationships and
diversity of Chatham Island animals and their counter-
parts in New Zealand. The object of the programme
is to examine patterns of molecular and morphologi-
cal evolution within the context of a known age of the
Chathams Islands. The research will be primarily lab-
oratory based applying molecular, systematics, popula-
tion genetics and phylogenetics techniques to a range of
vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, and may utilise an-
cient DNA techniques. You will need to be prepared
to participate in several ﬁeld trips to the Chathams
Islands and regions of mainland New Zealand, to inter-
act eﬀectively with a large multidisciplinary team (in-
cluding geologists, ecologists and geneticists) and with
staﬀ of relevant institutions that may provide addi-
tional study material. You should have experience in
genetics and with standard laboratory techniques and
in other areas such as biogeography, ecology, taxonomy
and computation.
The Chatham Islands: an emergent ark? The Chatham
Islands (situated ~700 km west of New Zealand in the
Paciﬁc Ocean) and their biota have long been thought
to be of ancient origin. But, new evidence suggests that
the Chatham Islands may have existed for as little as 4
million years.
If veriﬁed, then the arrival and establishment of all
land-dwelling plants and animals in the Chatham Is-
lands has been rapid, and in biological terms, recent.
This concept has major implications for understand-
ing rates and mechanisms of dispersal and colonization
over large distances, speciation, biodiversity of oceanic
islands and the biological history of New Zealand.
The proposed research will involve geological and bio-
logical studies. It will be detective, searching for criti-
cal geological evidence of two major processes: sea level
change and tectonic uplift. Biological research will com-pare DNA sequences from selected Chatham Islands
and mainland plants and animals to explore the timing,
pattern and ecological consequences of colonization and
isolation.

Ecology 10: 1645-1656; Lambert et al., 2002 Science
295: 2270-2273). Speciﬁcally, the student will be ex-
pected to have a good academic background, a training
in molecular biology and an interest molecular evolu-
tion. The project will involve interactions with a mul-
tidisciplinary team including specalists in geology, car-
bon dating, anatomists and microbiologists. The suc-
cessful candidate will be required to undertake ﬁeld
work in Antarctica for approximately one month per
year. These data will provide fundamental knowledge
about evolutionary processes.12 EvolDir October 1, 2003
A scholarship of $25,000NZ per annum is available, plus
student fees. In New Zealand, enrolment in a PhD pro-
gramme requires a Master or BSc Hons degree. The
PhD programme at Massey University has no papers
requirement and the scholarship is for a three year pe-
riod. It is envisaged that the successful candidate will
commence in early 2004.

of Quantitative Traits
The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of
the National Institutes of Health has awarded the De-
partment of Genetics an Institutional Research Train-
ing Grant for predoctoral training in “The Genetic Ar-
chitecture of Quantitative Traits.”
Quantitative, or complex, traits are aﬀected by multi-
ple interacting genes, each of which have small eﬀects
and are sensitive to the environment. Understanding
the molecular nature of genetic variation for quantita-
tive traits will have an enormous impact on medicine,
livestock and crop breeding, and the study of evolution.
For over half a century North Carolina State University
has been a leading center for research in quantitative
genetics. To enable future scientists to advance our un-
derstanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative
traits, we oﬀer a research and training program that in-
tegrates quantitative, population, molecular and devel-
opmental genetics, statistics and molecular evolution.
Our program oﬀers:* $19,968 stipend with tuition and health insurance *
Travel allowance and research funds * State-of-the-art
research facilities * Internationally recognized faculty
with expertise in theoretical and experimental quanti-
tative genetics * A stimulating academic environment
near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Duke University and the Research Triangle Park * A
beautiful and aﬀordable location with a pleasant cli-
mate between the beaches and the Appalachian moun-
tains
US citizens and permanent residents are eligible for
Fellowships. The Department of Genetics is strongly
committed to promoting diversity in the scientiﬁc com-
munity and encourages applications from individuals of
historically under-represented minority groups.

The study of sexual selection focuses intensively on
’costs’: male-male competition can lead to injuries; fe-
male choice can itself be costly, and lead to the evolu-
tion of ’handicapping’ male ornaments; and sexual con-
ﬂict can cause substantial reductions in male and espe-
cially female ﬁtness. Against this background it is very
surprising that costs are rarely, if ever, interpreted in a
full demographic context. Do we expect sexual selection
to be ’bad’ or ’good’ for a population and species, in the
sense of increasing extinction probability? As a clas-
sic example, did the Megaloceros (“Irish Elk”) become
extinct 10,000 years ago because its enormous antlers
made it vulnerable? Should conservationists pay more
attention to colourful and dimorphic species because
they might cope less well in unforeseen environmental
circumstances? Or does sexual selection instead purge
populations of harmful alleles and so improve popula-
tion viability?
The studentship ’Sexual selection and the risk of ex-
tinction’ will use two approaches to examine the con-
servation implications of sexual selection. Firstly, thereOctober 1, 2003 EvolDir 15
is currently very little theory developed to predict pop-
ulation consequences of sexual selection. The student
will develop demographic models to ﬁll in some of these
gaps. Secondly, s/he will use phylogenetic datasets on
ﬁshes, amphibians, and birds to examine whether risk
of extinction is associated with sexual selection. There
is also potential for empirical work at a later stage of
the project, depending on the interests of the student.
The student will be based in Finland, joining Dr.
Kokko’s highly international group of 3 PhD students
and 1 postdoctoral fellow, all working on diﬀerent as-
pects of how individual behaviour and population dy-
namics interact. Additionally, the student will visit
the University of East Anglia several times during
the course of the Ph.D. For more information on the
research groups involved, see http://www.helsinki.ﬁ/-
˜hmkokko/ andhttp://www.helsinki.ﬁ/˜hmkokko/ The
salary is approx. 1850 EUR/month (after tax approx.
1300 EUR/month). The studentship additionally oﬀers
good funding for participating in international meetings
and other forms of training. Candidates should have a
strong interest in theoretical and comparative analyses
of ecological questions. Interested candidates should
send a curriculum vitae, a brief summary of research
experience and interests, and two letters of reference
by October 3rd to:
Hanna Kokko, Department of Ecology and Systematics,

USussex Evolution
STUDY EVOLUTION AT SUSSEX Two postgraduate
scholarships are available for 2004 at the Centre for the
Study of Evolution, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK
The Centre for the Study of Evolution (CSE) is a cross-
disciplinary research group within the University of
Sussex which aims to develop and utilize evolutionaryideas. Members include biologists, biochemists, math-
ematicians and computer scientists. The CSE builds
upon the ethos and distinguished contributions of Prof.
John Maynard Smith, who founded the biology school
at the University of Sussex in 1961, and continues
evolutionary biology research within the CSE today.
www.biols.susx.ac.uk/CSE
Two PhD scholarships are available, to begin Jan-
uary 2004 (later start date possible). Download
a more detailed project description from http://-
www.biols.susx.ac.uk/CSE/graduatestudy.htm 1. Hox
genes and the evolution of animal body plans: a bioin-
formatic approach This project will create compara-
tive databases and new analytical tools for develop-
mental genes to test the association between key “body
patterning genes” and their hypothesized role in body
plan evolution (with optional laboratory component).
Open to UK residents of any nationality. Supervi-
sors: Lindell Bromham (L.D.Bromham@sussex.ac.uk)
and Juan-Pablo Couso (j.p.couso@biols.susx.ac.uk).
2. Tempo and mode of evolution: using DNA data to
uncover evolutionary patterns and processes Molecular
data are ideal for exploring deep evolutionary history of
all organisms and for testing evolutionary hypotheses.
This project will use databases of DNA sequences to
investigate rate of molecular evolution and to explore
the reliability of DNA as a recorder of evolutionary his-
tory. Other ideas for projects in evolutionary biology
will be considered. Open to all nationalities (but non-
EU students will need additional funding for fees - con-
tact for more details). Supervisor: Lindell Bromham

Vienna Drosophila
PhD position available in ecological genetics
The successful candidate is expected to work on the
isolation and functional characterization of ecologically
important genes in Drosophila melanogaster.
D. melanogaster is of African origin and has recently
expanded its habitat range to more temperate regions.
Using a genome-wide scan for genes involved adapta-tions required for this habitat shift, my laboratory has
identiﬁed a number of candidate regions. The PhD
position is available for the further characterization of
some of the identiﬁed regions.
Prospective candidates should have either a strong
background in molecular evolution or molecular genet-
ics.
Current members of the laboratory come from Austria,
China, Germany, Italy and Scotland. The laboratory
operates bilingually, allowing non-German speaking re-
searchers to integrate easily.
Vienna provides a stimulating scientiﬁc environment
with a number of research groups focusing on pop-
ulation genetics and evolutionary biology: Reinhard
Burger, Ulf Dieckmann, Dustin Penn, Karl Sigmund,
Peter Schuster and Claus Vogl. Apart from good sci-
ence, Vienna also oﬀers an active cultural life (2 operas,
2 world class concert houses, numerous museums and
the famous coﬀee houses) and attractive recreation op-
portunities (alps are close by and you can sail within
the city area!).
Further questions concerning the project and appli-
cations should be directed to Christian Schlotterer

Dear Evoldir Colleagues-
Please pass on this message to any students and/or col-
leagues who might be interested in the position.
I am seeking to hire a full-time permanent lab-
oratory technician to conduct research in the ar-
eas of quantitative and molecular genetics of shell-
ﬁsh, especially oysters. The position is with the
USDA Agricultural Research Service as part of
a program for the selective breeding of cultured
shellﬁsh ( http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/-
projects.htm?ACCN NO@5577&fy 02) . The posi-
tion is located in Newport, OR at Oregon State
University’s Hatﬁeld Marine Science Center ( http://-
hmsc.oregonstate.edu/ ). The laboratory is designed
for high-throughput genotyping of microsatellite and
single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including automated
DNA sequencing and liquid handling, and research will
focus on using these methods for QTL mapping and
gene expression analyses of loci contributing to life his-
tory traits , stress and disease resistance, economically
important characters such as shelf-life and meat qual-
ity, and morphological characters such as shell shape
and coloration patterns. Recently, a larger number of
mapped microsatellite loci have become available in the
Paciﬁc Oyster, Crassostrea gigas, that will greatly fa-
cilitate this work, and SNP markers are in development
in other laboratories. In addition the main campus in
Corvallis has the technology for microarray analysis,
and there is a growing amount of sequence data avail-
able will greatly facilitate the development of DNA chip
technology in the near future.
The ideal candidate would have a Master’s degree, but
practical experience in a working lab would be con-
sidered equivalent if it provided familiarity with the
necessary molecular techniques (DNA/RNA isolation,24 EvolDir October 1, 2003
PCR, electrophoresis, molecular cloning, DNA sequenc-
ing etc.). Familiarity with the bioinformatic and statis-
tical approaches used to analyze molecular genetic data
are also highly desirable , but training can be provided.
There will be some ﬁeld work required for animal rear-
ing and data collection. I am looking for more of a
high-level laboratory manager who will contribute to
the intellectual aspects of the work rather than sim-
ply a pair of hands at the bench. There will be ample
scope for independent projects, presentation of results
at meetings and in publications, and participation in
formulating research agendas. The advertised salary
range is large, so there is ample scope for advancement
for more junior applicants, and more senior applicants
will be given full consideration.
Newport is a small, oceanfront city with unspoiled
beaches, an active ﬁshing ﬂeet, and numerous tourist
attractions located at the mouth of the Yaquina Bay
on the central Oregon coast. The cost of living is very
reasonable, especially compared to other west coast ar-
eas. Portland is about 2.5 hours north, and Corvallis is
about 1 hour east.
Please email or call me with any questions, but be sure
to apply according to the instructions in the oﬃcial an-
nouncement below, including a cover letter that specif-

RiceU Dictyostelium technician
A technician position is available immediately for work
on the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a
unique and exciting model organism for social evolu-
tion. D. discoideum has cooperation, conﬂict, and com-
plete reproductive altruism in its social stage. It also
has a short generation time, a sequenced genome, tech-
niques for knocking out and modifying genes, and it
can be easily studied in the laboratory and the ﬁeld.
The project, a collaboration with Dictyostelium ge-
nomics researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, in-
volves ﬁnding genes underlying sociality, examining the
evolutionary history of these genes, and testing ances-
tral forms in vivo. It also involves testing whether so-
cial conﬂict leads to rapid evolution and arms races,
and determining how cheating is controlled. The po-
sition is funded by a large 5 year NSF grant from
the Frontiers in Biological Research (FIBR) program.
We are a friendly and interactive team of highly mo-tivated investigators. We are seeking a person with
a B.A. or a B. S. in a biological or bioengineering
ﬁeld interested in working with an ABI 3100 auto-
mated DNA sequencer, conducting experiments on D.
discoideum, and teaching newcomers to the team. Ex-
perience with basic cell and molecular biology tech-
niques, excellent time management, organizational and

ITS region answers
Dear all, I wanted to thank all the people that helped
me in ﬁnding informations on using ITS for phyloge-
netic studies, here you will ﬁnd a summary of the in-
formation that I get.
thanks again Ciao
I spent some time pursuing this approach in European
newts back in the mid-1980s (using Southern blotting
rather than sequencing). The methodology has been
used more in plants than animals, perhaps because
there were more attractive, accessible options in ani-
mals - especially mtDNA. The beneﬁt of these genes
used to be that they were conserved and numerous
enough to allow the use of “universal” probes. PCR and
easy sequencing of alternative nuclear markers mean
that these earlier beneﬁts are now probably disadvan-
tages. Although there is concerted evolution, the ri-
bosomal copies (“cistrons”) will not all be identical -
especially as they are usually located in more than one
chromosomal location - so the data will be messy. I
believe however that these genes could nonetheless be
useful for analysing reticulate patterns, as populations
will acquire new variants during secondary contact (a
sort of “molecular passport”). In practice they would
probably have to be analysed using PCR and length,
rather than sequence, variation, as it would be imprac-
tical to sequence multiple copies from single individuals.
Here is a paper that lists PCR primers for most organ-
isms.

DNA: molecular evolution and phylogenetic inference.”

Bernatchez’s lab, who have used ITS-1 to assess phylo-
geography and historical demography in brown trout,
Salmo trutta. The references are:

copied Michael on this message - it may be that each

This really won’t be so much of a help to your request
but here it goes.
Ive been working with bacterial ITS regions for the past
year. In spite of the fact that it is not actually ver-
tebrate ITS, the bibliographic research I made almost
always conducted me to bacterial ITS or FUngal ITS.
I dont really know if you’ll ever ﬁnd much about it in
higher vertebrates or if there will be enough informa-
tion to conduct phylogeographic analysis.
it depends on what you are interested in. In general
I would recommened the book “Phylogeography” by
Avise, there is a lot of what you can do intraspeciﬁ-
cally.
Nevertheless, there was a littlebit information at you
mail... Maybe you can send more... ???
just a brief statement about ITS evolution. Check out

transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) exhibits a common core
structure in vertebrates and yeast. Nucleic Acids Re-
search 27: 4533-4540.
or

polymorphisms in mole rats. Mol Biol Evol 4: 602-610.
or
my contribution (which is related to “do” and “not-do”
of secondary structure models) in Canadian Journal of
Zoology, 79: 334-345, from the year 2001.
Im not working with the ITS region, but I know some-
body who did a lot of coral phylogenetics with it. His
name is Todd LaJeneusse. I think he is still employed
at the University of Athens (US). I dont have his email
adress at the moment, but maybe you can ﬁnd it using
the internet. He also did some publications on it.
Maybe this can help you a little bit. If you contact
him tell him my regards. recieved an email about your
wanting info on ITS. I worked with ITS1 in Rana here44 EvolDir October 1, 2003
in North America. I would be very cautious when us-
ing this. I found up to 5 paralogs in a single individual.
You need to make sure that concerted evolution is ef-
fective in your taxa of interest. Sequence individuals
several times. I believe that Rana actually has multi-
ple loci for ITS and/or rDNA in general. You should
try to test this hypothesis before pursuing this. If you

Hi there,
I have a question regarding how to test for Isolation
by Distance with the Mantel test, given parwaise Fst
values and parwaise Km distances between a set of pop-
ulations.
My doubt is: Is there any reason for chosing better
Fst/(1-Fst) instead of Fst?? are they comparable??
any methodological or statistical issues to consider?
any feedback is sincerely appreciated, Thank you very
much!

Mantel test answers
Hi everyone, Thank you very much to all the people
that replied my question. I’ve received lots of mails,
half of them with interesting ideas and literature and
half of them asking me to send them the feedback. So
here are the most interesting answers I got.
THE QUESTION—- >Fst/(1-Fst) or Fst for mantel
test, and why??
THE MAIN ANSWERS:
The answer to your question on the Evoldir network
regarding isolation by distance is in Rousset (1997, Ge-
netics; see also his 2001 review in Handbook of statisti-
cal genetics, ed by Balding et al.). Using Fst / (1 Fst)
is based on a formal population genetics model, under
which you actually expect a relationship with distance.
The relationship is expected to hold under conditions
larger than those modelled by Rousset (1997). See a
recent paper by Leblois et al. in MBE.
————————–
Fst is distributed between 0 and 1, whereas Fst/(1-
Fst) potentially varies between 0 and inﬁnity. WhenOctober 1, 2003 EvolDir 45
you are doing correlations, upper or lower bounds are
a nuisance, and in this way you at least get rid of the
former.
As for isolation by distance (ibd), my feeling is that the
term is used in two ways, both loosely and strictly. In
many recent papers, I see people loosely call ibd any
correlation between genetic and geographic distance.
In these cases, a Mantel test is Ok. Strictly speak-
ing, though, (which means in the sense of Mal` ecot-
Morton and Kimura-Weiss), ibd is the product of ge-
netic drift leading populations to diverge, and short-
range gene ﬂow leading them to converge genetically.
Both in models where populations are continuously
(Mal` ecot-Morton) or discontinuously (Kimura-Weiss)
distributed, that combination of drift and gene ﬂow
causes an asymptotic decline of genetic resemblance
with distance. In other words, kinship between pop-
ulations decreases up to a certain distance, and then it
goes to zero.
In practice, the two diﬀerent deﬁnitions do make a dif-
ference, because (1) under the former, but not under
the latter any genetic gradient or cline (including those
determined by long-range gene ﬂow, range expansion
and the like) are taken as evidence of ibd, and (2) over
an area much greater than the dispersal distance of the
species you are studying, drift and gene ﬂow may gen-
erate local clines but not a general correlation between
genetic and geographic distances.
I hope these comments did not increase the confusion.
The relevant literature is wide, but among the oldies
I would still recomment Cavalli-Sforza and Wijsman
(1984) Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 15:279-301, Kimura
& Weiss (1964) Genetics 49:561-576 and Slatkin (1989)
Genome 31:196-202.
————————————
I use Fst/(1-Fst) as recommended by Rousset’s 1997
Genetics article. Whereas Fst goes to 1 as populations
become more diﬀerentiated, Fst/(1-Fst) goes to inﬁn-
ity. So if you’re regressing against geographic distance,
which goes to inﬁnity, it’s appropriate to use Fst/(1-
Fst). Also, something a lot of authors overlook is that
you should specify whether you are considering your
populations to be in 1-dimensional arrays or 2-d ar-
rays. If they are essentially 1-dimensional (like along a
river) you should regress against geographic distance,
but if you consider your populations to be in 2-d ar-
rays, you should use its log transform. Rousset covers
this as well- that and Slatkin’s 1993 (Evolution) and
1985 (Ann Rev Ecol Syst) articles have been the most
helpful to me.
—————————————–
A variety of measures have been used on the “Y” and“X” axis of IBD plots. For examples, see:
Slatkin, M. 1993. Isolation by distance in equilibrium
and non-equilibrium populations. Evolution 47: 264-
79.
Rousset, F. 1997. Genetic diﬀerentiation and estima-
tion of gene ﬂow from F-statistics under isolation by
distance. Genetics 145: 1219-28.
Hutchinson, D.W. and A.R. Templeton. 1999. Corre-
lation of pairwise genetic and geographic distance mea-
sures: inferring the relative inﬂuences of gene ﬂow and
drift on the distribution of genetic variability. Evolu-
tion 53: 1898-914.
Even the geographic distance axis is log-transformed in
some cases and not others.
I suggest that you examine scatterplots and try a vari-
ety of metrics, log-transformed or not. If you are inter-
ested in the IBD slope, then the most important consid-
eration is that the plot meets the standard assumptions
of regression (the relationship is linear, residuals are not
skewed, etc.)
Seehttp://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/IBD.html for
some software to help with this.

Marker choice answers
Dear EvolDir,
The original question was: Can anyone actually justify
spending time, eﬀort and money on randomly generated46 EvolDir October 1, 2003
molecular markers (e.g. AFLPs and RAPDs/ISSRs) for
ecological studies that assume (hope) markers are selec-
tively neutral? Has anyone attempted to correlate any
of these randomly generated markers with ecological
variables?
I doubt whether we can justify the use of randomly gen-
erated fragments of DNA (their gel proﬁles) to study
population processes, e.g. gene ﬂow, which demand the
use of selectively neutral markers. Surely time, eﬀort
and money would be best spent using a reliable (repeat-
able) standard technique (e.g. SSRs) that allows us to
make informative comparisons between studies. But
it would be interesting if researchers were to routinely
scoop randomly generated bands from gels, sequence
them and compare them with whats in the databases.
This might indicate which ecological variables (if any)
promote the patterns of variation in randomly gener-
ated molecular markers, assuming some of them are
coding DNA.
Thanks to those who responded.
Here are the responses:
1. I think that a couple of papers by Leif Skot’s group
at IGER, published last year in moleclar ecology would
be useful. What they tried to do was correlate AFLP
markers with temperature tolerance in Lolium perenne.

2. I am writing a paper about the history of randomgenetic drift in the Wrightian sense. If you place a neu-
tral marker on a chromosome, then it will behave not
as random drift over 10s or 100s of generations, but as
a neutral marker tied with whatever factors happen to
be near it. Thus your idea, of correlating these neutral
markers with ecological variables, would explain a lot
about what actually happens to neutral markers over
this time. But over deep evolutionary time, as in the
neutral or nearly neutral theories, the situation may
change and random drift becomes possible.
3. I don’t believe that multilocus PCR based marker
are selectively neutral but as they are screened from all
the genomes they are good indicators of evolution event
that concern all the genome, as genetict drift for exam-
ple. Pattern of diﬀerentiation by genetic drift inform
you about ecological factors acting on gene ﬂow and
organism dispersion such as fragmentation, ecological
barriers or local adaptation, etc...
4. Do you mean to ask:
If we do not assume (for very strong theoretical and
empirical reasons) that most DNA is not being selected
for (ignoring purifying selection): HAS anyone rejected
the null hypothesis that is there is lots of selection and
the alternative hypothesis is that the DNA is neutral:
than the answer is probably not.
Has anyone attempted to correlate any of these ran-
domly generated markers with ecological variables?
Most deﬁnitely. The surprise, is when some markers
have patterns that can not be explain by random drift
5. A couple of years ago we looked at both AFLP and
ISSR markers (we rejected RAPD’s because of the lit-
erature reporting inconsistencies, and the number of
bands generated is small compared with AFLP and
ISSR’s).
The time and eﬀort in setting up the AFLP system was
high. In the end we never got the process to work con-
sistently, diﬀerent DNA extractions from the same leaf
generated diﬀerent banding patterns. So we gave up,
the process has too many steps which could go wrong
(or not work consistently) and we couldn’t determine
where the method failed. All in all we probably spent
6 months faﬃng with the AFLP method.

Otter faecal samples answers
Hi everyone, Thank you very much for all your com-
ments and suggestions. Since some of you have asked
to send them the answers I decided to post them here.
————————————————–
There is a Conservation Genetics, a Dallas & Marshall
from 2000, sexing otter with scats. Read also the rich
litterature of Taberlet, and revues from Reed (Cons ge-
netics) and Miller and Waits in Genetics.
I do work with birds feces, but I must tell it’s not re-
ally a classical type of lab set up, as you have to count
with repeats (as I guess you know) and contamination
from others tissues et from ampliﬁed fragments. If you
haven’t taken this into account, please read the guide-
lines published in reviews and in Taberlet. This is a bit
crucial here. For instance, don’t try to amplify frag-
ments longer than 350 pb for sequencing of microsat:
It just won’t work.
————————————————–
I have some experience in extracting DNA from otter
spraints. I collected spraints in the ﬁeld, but only the48 EvolDir October 1, 2003
ones that were very fresh. I went out early in the morn-
ing and had the best success with spraints that were
found under bridges, where they are not exposed to
sun and rain. I kept them in plastic bags, as cool as
possible and when I returned to the lab, I stored the
spraints in ATL buﬀer, supplied with the Qiagen ex-
traction kit. I was working in cold conditions, and then
ATL buﬀer is not suitable to take into the ﬁeld, since
it precipitates at low temperatures. I stored 400 micro-
liter of spraint material in an eppendorf tube with 400
microliter ATL buﬀer and then put everything in the
freezer. For DNA extraction I used the Qiagen Stool
kit as well as the Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit. Both gave
similar results, but since, the tissue kit is less expensive
per extraction, I used that one in my ﬁnal analysis. Be-
fore DNA-isolation, I ﬁrst vortexed the eppendorf tubes
and then spinned them. I took the supernatant as one
subsample and the rest as the other subsample and di-
gested with proteinase K at 55 C overnight, and follow
the rest of the extration protocol provided with the kit.
Only 34% of my spraints yielded DNA, which seems
to be quite good for ﬁeld-collected spraints. Among
the spraints I collected were also anal jellies, which can
sometimes be found. Of these jellies, 58% yielded DNA,
so these are very worth while collecting.
———————————————
I guess freeezing is out of question? We had some-
body in my old lab working on bonobos (pygmy chim-
panzees). They put the faecal sample in 100% alcohol
and used an extraction method speciﬁed in Gerﬂoﬀ et
al. (I can’t remember journal and year, but it must have
been araound 1998?). I extract parasite DNA from fae-
cal samples and have a lot of problems with inhibitors
as well. My current method is a standard CTAB ex-
traction followed by a clean-up step using Qiagen PCR
puriﬁcation columns. Then I dilute the extract 1 in 10
and PCR work well with that. Diluting may not be an
option for you (??). But You could also try to use some
faecal material and do a chelex extraction, then spin
down and then purify supernantant over columns.
———————————————————
I’m working with arctic fox DNA from faeces. We also
use the Qiamp stool kit and it works great. We collect
the samples in plastic jars containing silica pellets that
dries the faeces when we are in the ﬁeld. When we get
back to the department we freeze the jars (with sam-
ples) in -80 degrees C (but -20 works too), which fur-
ther freeze dries the faeces. This works also for wolver-
ine faeces... My guess would be that your problem lies
mainly with the preservation method rather than the
extraction kit. Or possibly that you preservative inter-
feres with the extraction...
—————————————————I think that otters are inherently one of the most diﬃ-
cult species for faecal DNA nalysis. We analyzed a de-
cay series of spraints left outside for 1, 2, 4, ... 128 hours
before preservation in ethanol. Proportions of spraints
in which microsatellites were detected had a max. of
0.6 falling to approx. 0.05 after 24 hours. As you can
see from the Dallas et al. 2003 paper, overnight-fresh
spraints yielded a proportion with composite genotypes
of 0.2 using radioactive detection and manual sequenc-
ing gels. Ettore Randi’s group gets about double this
value for fresh spraints using ﬂuorescence detection on
a capillary sequencer.
Species discrimination is more successful than individ-
ual identiﬁcation (Hansen & Jacobsen 1999). Hansen

ANNOUNCEMENT
The book, DANGEROUS LIAISONS? When
Cultivated Plants Mate with Their Wild Rela-
tives by Norman Ellstrand will be published in
early November by Johns Hopkins University
Press. A link to the publisher and the book is
http://www.press.jhu.edu/press/books/titles/f03/-

Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/-

The following is the publisher’s description of the book:
With the advent of genetic engineering, “designer”
crops might interbreed with natural populations. Could
such romances lead to the evolution of “superweeds”,
as some have suggested? But haven’t crops had sexOctober 1, 2003 EvolDir 49
with wild plants in the past? Has such gene swapping
occurred without consequences? And if consequences
have indeed occurred, what lessons can be gleaned for
engineered crops?
In Dangerous Liaisons? Norman Ellstrand examines
these and other questions. He begins with basic in-
formation about the natural hybridization process. He
then describes what we now know about hybridization
between the world’s most important crops – such as
wheat, rice, maize, and soybeans – and their wild rel-
atives. Such hybridization, Ellstrand explains, is not
rare, and has occasionally had a substantial impact.
In some cases, the result was problematic weeds. In
others, crop genes have diluted natural diversity to the
point that wild populations of certain rare species were
absorbed into the gene pool of the more common crop,
essentially bringing the wild species to the brink of ex-
tinction.
Ellstrand concludes with a look to the future. Will en-
gineered crops pose a greater threat than traditional
crops? If so, can gene ﬂow and hybridization be man-
aged to control the escape of engineered genes? This
book will appeal to academics, policy makers, students,
and all with an interest in environmental issues.

Hi everybody
I am currently doing a population genetic study on a
succulent Saxifraga species. I’ve tried several DNA ex-
traction protocols (DNeasy kit from Qiagen, CTAB and
SDS). I was only successful with the SDS method, but
the bands were very weak and no further PCR ampliﬁ-
cation could be obtained. The plants I’m working with
contain apparently a lot of polysaccharides!!! Since I
would like to perform AFLPs, I though need high qual-

genetic interpretations of character evolution (likeli-
hood, parsimony, comparative methods), simulations
(sequence evolution, coalescence, speciation), multi-
variate analysis (PCA, CVA), and other analyses (e.g.,
parametric bootstrap, compositional bias, tree com-
parisons, randomizations, cluster analysis). Molec-
ular, morphological and continuous-valued data can
be edited and analyzed. Its interface is graphical
and interactive, with charts and phylogenetic visual-
izations. Mesquite operates on Windows, Linux/Unix,
and the Mac OS (9 and X). An outline of features (with

Software NeEstimator 1 1
New software (NeEstimator) is available for free
download from http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/ﬁshweb/-
11629.html
NeEstimator software estimates eﬀective population
sizes (Ne) from allele frequency data. The user can
estimate Ne using any of the three internal methods or
three third party programs. Genotypes from a sampleof the population are used as input. The user provides
this data in GENEPOP, ARLEQUIN or simple column
(eg. saved as a tab delimited text ﬁle from Microsoft
Excel) format.
The three internal methods are as follows.
* A point estimation method using linkage/gametic
disequilibrium, (Hill, 1981). * A point estimation
method using heterozygote excess (Pudovkin, Zaykin
and Hedgecock, 1996). * A temporal method using mo-
ments based F-statistics (Krimbas and Tsakas, 1971;
Nei and Tajima, 1981; Pollock, 1983 or Waples, 1989).
The elapsed number of generations between temporal
samples is required.
The three third party programs that NeEstimator is
able to utilise are as follows.
* A temporal method using a Bayesian based approach
called TM3 ( http://www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/ ˜ mab/-
software.html ). * A temporal method using a
maximum likelihood based approach called MCLEEPS
(http://www.stat.washington.edu/thompson/Genepi/-
Mcleeps.shtml ). * A temporal method using a
pseudo likelihood approach called MLNE ( http://-
www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/ioz/people/wang.htm ).

Software PHASE 2 0
A new version of PHASE (2.0) - a software pack-
age for estimating haplotypes from population geno-
type data - is now available. The software is free for
academic use, via http://www.stat.washington.edu/-
stephens/software.html . The new version features sev-
eral improvements on the previous version of PHASE,
including:
+ the introduction of a new computational approach,
resulting in much faster haplotype resolution.
+ the introduction of a new model that allows for re-October 1, 2003 EvolDir 51
combination and decay of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
with distance, which results in more accurate haplo-
type estimates. This model also allows the user to esti-
mate recombination rates, and identify recombination
hotspots from population genotype data.
+ the facility to perform a test for haplotype frequency
diﬀerences between cases and controls.
+ more extensive output summarising the results
Please read the new instructions carefully before use (a
quick tour for existing users is included to minimize in-
convenience, but there are a few changes that existing
users will need to note).
I apologise in advance that you will be asked to reregis-
ter before downloading the new version: this is so that
we can more accurately monitor usage and demand.
I hope you ﬁnd this new version helpful,

Software Populus
Populus 5.2.1 has been downloaded by 9,700 users in
the six months since its February release. Our Min-
nesota website, http://ecology.umn.edu/populus now
oﬀers Populus 5.3, a major update containing new mod-
ules on stage-structured population growth, macropar-
asitic infection dynamics, the evolution of disease viru-

mitted plasmids, the evolution of temperance in phage,
and insect resistance management. In addition to these
content additions, we now include life history diagrams
that serve as both input and output screens for the age-
and stage-projection modules. This means that a stu-
dent can initiate demographic projections by specifying
an lxmx schedule, by drawing a graph of age or stage
nodes on-screen and setting transition parameters, or
by providing the elements of a projection matrix and
population-state vector. Finally, we have collected the

Software QTLExpress
QTL Express: http://qtl.cap.ed.ac.uk/ [Funded by the
UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research
Council]
We are pleased to announce an updated version of our
user-friendly web-based QTL mapping package, and the
addition of new modules. We now cater for the follow-
ing population structures:
(1) F2 populations from inbred or outbred lines
(2) F2 or advanced intercross population from inbred
lines
(3) [NEW] Combined backcross and F2 populations
from inbred or outbred lines. This new module is de-
signed for a mixture of (reciprocal) backcross and/or F2
population from inbred or outbred lines. Depending on
the crossing design, additive, dominance and parent-of-
origin QTL eﬀects are estimated. Single F2 or backcross
populations can also be analysed with this application.
(4) Large fullsib population
(5) Halfsib families
(6) [NEW] Nuclear families and sibpairs. This new
module is designed for samples of small nuclear fam-
ilies from an outbred population. Identity-by-descent
probabilities between sibs are estimated using Mer-
lin (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Merlin/-
). Marker genotypes on the parents are not required.
For all of the modules in QTL Express, permutation
testing to obtain signiﬁance threshold, bootstrapping
to obtain conﬁdence intervals, and the option of 1 and
2 QTL analyes are implemented. Genome-wide permu-
tation testing has now been implemented and the pos-
sibility to ﬁt cofactors in the model has been extended
to all population structures. The documentation has
been updated.
We would be grateful for comments, suggestions and
bug reporting (send all to: george.seaton@ed.ac.uk).
Other modules for applications in animal and human
populations are in preparation. We would appreciate
suggestions on speciﬁc modules to be added.

Jena EvolGenomics
Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Genomics
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the
Department of Genetics and Evolution at the Max-
Planck-Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena, Ger-
many.
This position is associated with a collaborative project
to examine the role of positive selection in the evolution
of recently duplicated and rapidly diverging genes in the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and close relatives.
We are currently focussing on genes potentially involved
in reproductive isolation, reponse to biotic stress and
genes of unknown function (orphan genes) that show
signatures of selection.
The work will involve the identiﬁcation of candidate
genes by computational mining of genome databases;the isolation, sequencing and annotation BAC clones;
the expression analysis of genes and tests of evolution-
ary hypotheses using phylogenetic reconstruction and
tests of positive selection. A background is molecular
biology and molecular evolution is expected. An in-
terest in quantitative aspects of sequence analysis and
proﬁciency in a programming language (our favorite is
Python) is highly desired.
The Department of Genetics and Evolution of the
Max-Planck-Institute of Chemical Ecology ( http://-
www.ice.mpg.de/tmo/home/home en.htm ) provides an
excellent work environment with a modern genomics
and bioinformatics infrastructure and a critical mass of

StonyBrookU Genomics
Postdoctoral Position in Genomics/Molecular Phyloge-
netics at Stony Brook University
An NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available in
the Wiens lab at Stony Brook University to help re-
construct squamate phylogeny using multiple nuclear
protein-coding loci and new genomic databases. This
position is funded for up to three years (starting salary
$30K), and will be available starting in January of 2004
. The project is an international, multi-institutional
venture that will involve a phylogenetic analysis of 142
squamate taxa using ~50 nuclear protein-coding loci,
analysis of morphological data from the same taxa and
~60 additional fossil taxa , and modeling studies ad-
dressing the combination of molecular, morphological,
and paleontological data.
The postdoctoral position will involve computational
screening of vertebrate genomes for potential loci, de-
velopment and testing of primers and genes, and large-
scale sequencing of some of these markers. The post-
doctoral researcher may also participate in simulation
studies of phylogeny reconstruction using diverse data
sets. Experience in molecular phylogenetics is ex-
pected; experience in developing nuclear markers, ge-
nomics, and/or computational biology are highly desir-
able. Mastery of at least one programming language
and interest in herpetology are preferred but not re-
quired.
The Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony
Brook is a stimulating, interactive environment with
several labs interested in diverse aspects of phyloge-
netics and molecular evolution. Other research in the
Wiens lab includes studies of systematic theory and ap-
plications of phylogenetics to a variety of topics in evo-
lution and ecology (e.g., speciation, species richness,
morphological evolution, ecological diversiﬁcation) us-56 EvolDir October 1, 2003
ing reptiles and amphibians as model systems.
In addition to the Wiens lab, the postdoctoral associate
will work closely with the labs of Dr. Tod Reeder and
Dr. Scott Kelley (both San Diego State Univ.) on the
comparative genomic aspects of the project. The post-
doc will also interact with the labs of Dr. Jack Sites
(Brigham Young Univ.) and Dr. Michael Lee (Univ.
Adelaide), who are also involved in the collection of
DNA sequence data for this project.
Review of applications will begin 22 October 2003 and

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION (Syracuse University)
MICROBIAL ECOLOGICAL GENETICS AND
FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS
A postdoctoral position is available immediately to in-
vestigate molecular mechanisms responsible for micro-
bial adaptation to membrane disturbing chemical nat-
ural products present in host plants and the nature of
mycological speciation mechanisms. Studies will em-
ploy functional genomic methods both in wild popula-
tions of the cactophilic yeast species of the clade Pichia
amethionina and the model baker’s yeast, S. cerevisiae.
Funds are available for up to three years of support.
Interested applicants should directly contact either
W.T. Starmer wstarmer@syr.edu or S.E. Erdman
seerdman@syr.edu, Dept. of Biology, Syracuse Univer-
sity.
SUMMARY
The major focus of the research is to understand the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of
new species of microorganisms. The research will tar-get the ecological-genetics involved in separating two
closely related sympatric yeasts in the genus Pichia.
The two yeasts in the Pichia amethionina complex live
in two diﬀerent columnar cactus types. These yeasts are
cactus speciﬁc. They are closely associated with other
cactus yeasts and rely on cactus-speciﬁc drosophilids
as vectors. The cacti they live in have major diﬀer-
ences in their host chemistry. Abundant triterpene gly-
cosides in one cactus type (subtribe: Stenocereinae) de-
ter the growth of one species while allowing growth of
the other. Identifying and isolating the gene/s responsi-
ble for this diﬀerence is the speciﬁc goal of the research.
Earlier work indicated at least one gene in P. amethion-
ina is responsible for the host-speciﬁc adaptation to the
triterpene glycosides. A genome-wide knockout library
recently created for S. cerevisiae has been used to screen
and identify candidate genes that could be involved in
the natural system.
There are four phases (goals) to the research plan. The
ﬁrst is to catalog all of the genes that can provide re-
sistance to triterpene glycosides in S. cerevisae. The
second is to determine which of these genes also confer
resistance to sensitive strains of P. amethionina. The
third is to determine which of the candidate loci that
do confer resistance are realized to provide resistance in
natural populations of P. amethionina. The fourth is
to discover the ecological constraints limiting the num-
ber of actual solutions to triterpene glycoside toxicity
and thus help explain the realized solution(s). This re-
search will provide interdisciplinary training for a post-
doctoral student in all aspects of the project from ﬁeld
collection and identiﬁcation of wild yeasts to molecular
genetic analyses.
Some results of this project to date have been:
– Identiﬁcation of natural product chemical sensitivity
growth rate phenotypes for 723 known and 268 pre-
viously unknown/unstudied genes of the genome of S.
cerevisiae;
– Characterization of linkage rates of phenotype to gene
replacement/knock-out in the large scale screen esti-
mate an 80% linkage rate of the TTG phenotype to
gene replacement/knock-out in each strain in the large
scale screen;
– Preliminary analysis of the genetic basis of diﬀerences
in the response of wild type S. cerevisiae strain back-
grounds (BY4743 and W303) to the agria TTG frac-
tion;
– Identiﬁcatjon of additional chemical sensitive pheno-
types for approx. 60 of an estimated 200 TTG resis-
tant and TTG super sensitive deletion strains screened.
These sensitivities are caused by agents with similarOctober 1, 2003 EvolDir 57
chemistry or biological targets (digitonin, organpipe
TTG fraction, saponin, glycerrhizin);
– Identiﬁcatjon of temperature dependent diﬀerential
TTG phenotypes for nearly half of the estimated 200
TTG resistant and TTG super sensitive deletion strains
screened.
– Construction and preliminary characterization of
strains deleted of homologous gene pairs for three sets
of novel yeast open reading frames identiﬁed by this
screen;
– Establishment of a web-based query tool to allow im-
mediate, pre-publication access by the yeast and scien-
tiﬁc community to the large-scale functional genomics
data generated by this project.

Methodology, Analysis, and Software for the Human
Haplotype Map Project
The human haplotype map (HapMap) is a major
($100M) international collaborative eﬀort to catalogue
the patterns of genetic variation, and in particular
association and linkage disequilibrium, in the human
genome, through the genotyping of around a million
SNPs in each of three population samples. The scale
and nature of the data being generated raises novel and
challenging analytical questions, which will demand the
development of new methodology and software.
Several of the leading groups on the analytical side of
the project are based in the University of Oxford. The
Mathematical Genetics and Bioinformatics Group in
the Department of Statistics, and Professor Lon Car-
don’s group in the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human
Genetics, were two of three internationally to be funded
by the SNP Consortium to work on HapMap analysis.
Three postdoctoral positions are available, each of two
years’ duration, to work on the development of analyt-
ical methods, and their application to the data being
generated by the project. Successful candidates may
start immediately, or at a mutually agreed date. Two
of the advertised positions will be based in the Don-
nelly and McVean groups, within the Department of
Statistics, the third in the Cardon group in the Well-
come Trust Centre for Human Genetics. There are close
collaborative links between these groups, in general and
over HapMap, and between them the University has one
of the largest centres internationally for human popu-
lation genetics modelling.
Applications for the PDRA posts are invited from re-
searchers interested in working on this high-impact
project: one of major importance in modern genetics.
Candidates should have relevant background research
experience in quantitative and statistical modelling.
Experience in modern computationally-intensive statis-
tical methods, and/or in population genetics, would be
an advantage, as would background knowledge of genet-
ics, though neither is essential for candidates committed
to moving into the ﬁeld.
We are also seeking a Scientiﬁc Programmer who will
work in the Donnelly and McVean groups, in close
collaboration with the modellers, to develop software
for implementing novel analytical tools. Experience in
C++ and/or Java is required. We envisage the post
holder as having a central role in the scientiﬁc develop-
ment of the project.
Well-qualiﬁed successful applicants for the four posts

To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
