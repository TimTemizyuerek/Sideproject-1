\21st Century Naturalists: integrating pattern and pro-
cess in evolution and ecology to understand biological
diversity"
The goal of the 2014 ASN meeting is to bring together
a diverse array of biologists who might not normally
encounter one another at their regular meetings, in a
small conference that facilitates new conversations. We
wish to create a setting where graduate students, post-
docs, and faculty can carry out discussions that dene
new research directions for our disciplines, energize the
ASN, integrate among biological disciplines, and fuse4 EvolDir March 1, 2013
theory, data, and new technologies.
We are seeking proposals for three symposia, one each
afternoon, that address one or more of the following
criteria:
(i) represent the intellectual breadth of the society, in-
cluding ecology and evolution, theory and empirical
work.
(ii) represent a novel synthesis of a topic or topics
(iii) represent future directions of ASN, including den-
ing the role of the society and \naturalists" in biology
(iv) represent the diversity of ASN biologists: demo-
graphic, gender and cultural diversity
Each symposium will run from 1 PM until 5:30 PM with
a half hour break in the middle, allowing time for eight
speakers with 30 minutes each (talk and question time).
Symposium proposals can suggest alternate structures
including dierent time limits per speaker, discussion
panels, et cetera.
To suggest a symposium:
Please send to the email address: amsocnatural-
ists@gmail.com with subject header \Symposium Pro-
posal"
1) 1) a symposium title
2) 2) name and contact information of proposer(s)
3) 3) a statement describing the topic of the sympo-
sium, how it is timely and novel, and how it ts into
the criteria above. The statement should be no more
than 500 words.
4) 4) a list of speakers and titles. Most speakers should
be conrmed in advance, and these should be noted.
Note: AAt present, ASN does not have funds to support
travel or registration costs for symposium speakers.
The deadline for symposium proposals is March 30
2013.

ICREA CONFERENCE ON THE EVOLUTION
OF MULTICELLULARITY BARCELONA, SPAIN
SEPTEMBER 30 - OCTOBER 1, 2013We are pleased to announce the ICREA Conference on
the Evolution of Multicellularity to be held Septem-
ber 30th - October 1st, 2013, in Barcelona (Spain).
The transition to multicellular life represents one of the
most important events in the history of life. Yet, de-
spite its signicance, little is known about the mech-
anisms involved in this transition. In recent years,
emerging data from various elds are providing new
insights into this major evolutionary transition. With
advances in theoretical, molecular/cell biology and ge-
nomics approaches, there is a clear need for further
conversation and collaborative eorts between exper-
imentalists and theoreticians. The ICREA Conference
on the Evolution of Multicellularity will bring together
researchers with diverse backgrounds with the goal of
stimulating and fostering inter-disciplinary discussion
and collaborations. The talks will be organized around
six mini-symposia encompassing the major topics and
approaches related to the evolution of multicellularity.
The six symposia are: 1) Origins and mechanisms; 2)
Development and Gene regulation; 3) Genomics ap-
proaches and insights; 4) Theoretical approaches; 5)
Social Evolution; 6) Computational and synthetic ap-
proaches. For additional information and updates (in-
cluding preliminary program, registration and abstract
submission deadlines) please visit the Conference page
at www.multicellularity2013.com/). Registration will
open in March.

Apr9-11
How will synthetic biology and conservation shape the
future of nature?
Synthetic biology promises to change the world in sig-
nicant ways, yet it is largely unrecognized within the
eld of conservation. This conference will bring to-gether the synthetic biology and the conservation prac-
titioner communities to discuss the implications that
synthetic biology may have for the natural world and
conservation and develop new thinking and new strate-
gies to cope with the potential challenges and opportu-
nities.
April 9-11, 2013 Clare College Cambridge, England
Sessions: 1. What is synthetic biology and what does
it have to do with conservation? 2. What is biodiver-
sity and how might it be aected by synthetic biology?
3. The practice of conservation and how it might be
aected by synthetic biology 4. Implications of syn-
thetic biology for wider social and economic change
relevant to future conservation 5. What aspects of
synthetic biology should conservationists worry about
and/or be excited about? And what areas of conser-
vation should synthetic biologists worry about and/or
be excited about? 6. The public landscape of synthetic
biology and conservation - how can we move forward?

The Genome 10K project aims to assemble a genomic
zooXa collection of DNA sequences representing the
genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species, approximately
one for every vertebrate genus. The trajectory of cost
reduction in DNA sequencing suggests that this project
will be feasible within a few years. The Genome 10K
project will directly reveal the molecular source of the
diversity of vertebrate animal forms, completely chart-
ing for the rst time the specic genomic changes that
drove the evolutionary innovations leading to the spec-
tacular diversity of vertebrates today. What we learn
from the genomes of present-day species will provide a
unique new window into the biology of vertebrates, in-
cluding our own species, and help us be better stewards
of the planets animal diversity.
We aim to gather many of the worlds experts in genome
assembly, alignment, and analysis to address the com-
putational challenges inherent in this ambitious project.
As the technology that makes the Genome 10K Project
possible speeds ahead, the problem of understanding
and interpreting the DNA data it generates looms ever
larger, threatening to eclipse the dramatic gains in se-
quencing throughput.
The diversity and complexity in vertebrate genomes re-
quire extremely challenging algorithms for identifying
the homologous segments needed to set up a frame-
work for comparative genome analysis and to recon-
struct the record of genetic changes leading to present-
day species. On a small scale, genomes have undergone8 EvolDir March 1, 2013
point mutations and small insertions and deletions. On
a larger scale, rearrangements and duplications have led
to varied chromosomal organizations. For this reason,
we must be able to assemble DNA sequence data from
a novel species de novo into a reference genome that is
accurate both on a chromosomal karyotype scale and
on the scale of individual DNA bases. Then we must
discover by genome-wide alignment methods the evo-
lutionary relationships between this new genome and
previously obtained genomes. This will be an improve-
ment on the current practice of relying from the start on
alignment of individual short reads from a new species
to an existing reference genome.
Please join us and share your ideas and expertise in
what promises to again be a productive and inspiring
meeting.

Please join us for the 2nd International Volvox Con-
ference (focused on the green alga Volvox and its close
relatives) to be held July 31 V August 3, 2013, in Fred-
ericton (New Brunswick, Canada). This is the second of
what we hope to be a long series of Volvox meetings to
be held every other year, alternating with the Chlamy-
domonas meetings. The rst meeting, in 2011, was a
great success (www.unbf.ca/vip/IVC/). Volvocine al-
gae have become an important model system for the
evolution of multicellularity, development and cellular
dierentiation, and lately have yielded important re-
sults in elds as diverse as genomics, hydrodynamics,
and social evolution. We hope that the meeting will
continue to foster exchange of ideas and expertise and
will initiate new collaborations. We also wish to attract
new people and to build a stronger Volvox community.
The meeting (through contributed papers and posters)
will highlight various aspects of the biology, taxon-
omy, ecology, development, genetics/genomics and evo-
lution of Volvox and its relatives. For additional infor-
mation and updates (including preliminary program,

III World Summit on Evolution June 01 to 05, 2013
The Universidad San Francisco de Quito has previously
organized World Summits on Evolution I and II which
have promoted the exchange of ideas among outstand-

aspects of biology. World Summit on Evolution III will
focus on the importance of evolution for humanity and
our planet.
Human activities such as agriculture, medicine, indus-
try, urbanization and tourism are leaving behind a foot-
print on many organisms, and these may lead to un-
expected consequences for humanity and the environ-
ment. The understanding of these interactions and re-
sponses is critical to both avoid and manage nature and
health-related complications.
The Galapagos Islands are a unique setting for this de-
bate not only because of their importance in evolution-
ary science and historical connections to Charles Dar-
win but also for their incomparable landscape scenery
and unique biota.

Abstract: Creation, curation and analysis of Protein10 EvolDir March 1, 2013
and RNA alignments with Jalview
Jalview (www.jalview.org) is a BBSRC funded open
source tool for the visualisation and analysis of pro-
tein and nucleic acid sequence alignments that is widely
used in teaching and research. Available as a web
based applet, or Desktop application, version 2.8 in-
corporates Jmol, a molecular structure viewer, and
the RNA structure viewer VARNA. The Jalview Desk-
top supports gure generation, and provides access
to a range of sequence, alignment, 3D structure and
annotation databases, and analysis services provided
by the University of Dundee and Free University of
Amsterdam. It also acts as a graphical client for
the alignment, protein disorder prediction and amino
acid conservation analysis programs made available as
Java Bioinformatics Analysis Web Services (http://-
www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws).
In this talk, I will highlight the key developments in
Jalview that have made it possible to create, curate
and analyse protein and RNA sequence alignments in
the context of structure, biological knowledge and evo-
lutionary analyses. I'll also discuss some of the current
challenges with regard to the creation, curation and
analysis of alignments, and how they t with Jalview's
development roadmap.

Summary: Quantitative approaches to evolutionary ge-
nomics, systems biology, and ecology unravel several
universal regularities connecting genome-scale observ-ables, phenotypes and physiological traits. A current
challenge for theoreticians is understanding how dif-
ferent universal features emerging empirically can be
accounted for by simple mathematical models explor-
ing quantitative laws at dierent levels, from physiol-
ogy to evolutionary genomics. The scope of this work-
shop is to give an overview of the current state of this
emerging eld. The workshop will primarily target PhD
students and postdocs with a physics or mathematics
background, but the school is open to anyone with back-
ground in (evolutionary) genomics, (evolutionary) biol-
ogy, bioinformatics, ecology, interested in quantitative
work.

Deception
Dear Colleagues:
the abstract deadline is approaching for the XIV
Congress of the European Society for Evolutionary Bi-
ology (https://www.eseb2013.com), happening in Lis-
bon, Portugal from the 19th - 24th August 2013. We
are pleased to invite abstract submissions for oral and
poster presentations until the 28th of February 2013,
for the symposium entitled:
EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF DECEP-
TION
Invited speakers: Martin Stevens (University of Cam-
bridge)
Tom Sherratt (Carleton University)
Johanna Mappes (University of Jyv askyl a)
Organisers: Carita Lindstedt-Kareksela (University of
Jyv askyl a)
Mikael Mokkonen (University of Jyv askyl a and Simon
Fraser University)
Description: The ability to deceive oneself, conspecics
or individuals of other species is a fundamental as-
pect to many coevolutionary struggles. Brood parasites
have the ability to produce eggs that exactly resemble
the egg coloration of their host species, while alterna-
tive mating strategies employed by ^ asneaker' individ-
uals circumvent confrontation in intrasexual competi-
tion - these are just a few examples of widely known
deceptive strategies in the animal kingdom. Deception
allows individuals to gain an evolutionary advantage in
reproduction and/or survival, such as through decep-
tive colour mimicry, predator-prey systems, sexually
antagonistic encounters with a mate, parent-ospring
interactions or competition over resources. Much of the
existing research on deception has been fragmented into
various topics with limited interaction, even though
there are some common themes such as frequency de-
pendent selection, manipulation of the receiver's sen-sory system, and the antagonistic coupling of the actor's
benets to costs of the recipient(s). Thus, our goals
of this symposium are to unify researchers from dier-
ent elds, as well as provide opportunities to present
novel ndings, questions, and dierent perspectives in
an eort to better understand the costs and benets of
deception.

EvolDrugResistance
Dear colleagues,
The four of us, Sarah Cobey (Harvard/U. Chicago),
Gabriel Perron (U. Ottawa), Fredrik Inglis (ETH) and
Pleuni Pennings (Stanford), are organizing a sympo-
sium, \The Evolution and Genetics of Drug Resis-
tance," at the European Society for Evolutionary Biol-
ogy (ESEB) meeting this August. The ESEB meeting is
the largest European conference on evolution and takes
place every two years. This summer it will be held in12 EvolDir March 1, 2013
Lisbon (https://www.eseb2013.com/). Approximately
1400 people are expected to attend.
There is general consensus that the evolution of drug
resistance is an interesting scientic topic and an im-
portant public health issue. We are very happy and
proud that this year there will be a symposium dedi-
cated to this theme at ESEB. We have two great in-
vited speakers, Cally Roper and Craig MacLean. Dr.
Roper studies drug resistance in malaria, including its
evolution and its global distribution. Dr. MacLean
has researched the evolutionary genetics of antibi-
otic resistance in the opportunistic human pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The deadline for abstracts is February 28. To sub-
mit your abstract, please rst register at https://-
www.eseb2013.com/ and then upload your abstract to
the site.
The four of us will evaluate the abstracts in a blinded
way, so that we will not know whose abstract we are
judging. The total amount of time allocated for our
symposium depends in part on the number of abstracts
received. More submissions will ensure an interesting
and lively session. We welcome studies that are based
on theory, data analysis, experiment, and/or clinical
research.
Feel free to forward this posting to anyone you think
may be interested. Below is the formal description of
our symposium.
We hope to see you this summer in Lisbon (which, by
the way, is a great city to visit).
Best wishes, Sarah, Gabriel, Fredrik, & Pleuni
Symposium: The Evolution and Genetics of Drug Re-
sistance
The evolution of drug resistance in pathogenic microor-
ganisms is one of the most important challenges facing
evolutionary biologists. Evolutionary studies of drug
resistance can aid the development of eective clinical
strategies. At the same time, such studies help further
our general understanding of evolutionary biology. Our
symposium provides a venue to discuss experimental
and theoretical studies that improve basic understand-
ing and/or inform clinical practice.

one of the rare elds of biology where evolution has
too often been neglected. The reason for this probably
stems from the misconception that evolution does not
act on an ecologically relevant time scale. Here, we
aim to combine evolutionary and conservation biology.
The symposium spans a large range of elds and will be
organized in three parts (1) Evolutionary theories (e.g.
viability of small populations, pace of allele xation,
role of phenotypic plasticity etc) (2) Evolutionary con-
straints on small population sizes and impacts of con-
servation measures. (3) Next generation sequencing:
genetic diversity, evolution and adaptative potential of
endangered species.
The symposium will lead to a special issue in Evo-
lutionary Applications http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/-

GenomicIslands
Dear Colleagues,
A reminder that the deadline for abstract submission is
the 28th February!!
We are particularly keen to cover the whole of this pro-
cess, and so want to highlight that the focus for the
symposium is not solely on speciation, but also the ge-
nomic architecture of local adaptation, we are also keen
to maintain a balance of theoretical and empirical con-
tributions.
As a part of the XIV Congress of the European Soci-
ety for Evolutionary Biology, which will be held in Lis-
bon from the 19th to 24th August 2013, we are pleased
to announce a symposium on \Genomic Islands: their
role in adaptation and speciation". Details of the sym-
posium are below, and we will be accepting abstract
submissions until the 28th February 2013.
Genomic Islands: their role in adaptation and specia-
tion

federlab.nd.edu/) Nick Barton (http://ist.ac.at/-
research/research-groups/barton-group/) Patrik Nosil
(http://nosil-lab.group.shef.ac.uk/)
Summary: Genome-wide data oers a unique opportu-
nity to gain an insight into the genomic architecture
involved in the adaptive divergence found in hetero-
geneous environments which can lead to local adapta-
tion, reproductive isolation and ultimately speciation.
By considering a range of species and approaches, this
symposium will explore the interactions of diversify-
ing selection and homogenizing gene ow to identify
trends in genomic evolution which accompany adap-
tation and ecological speciation. The symposium will
focus on both theory and empirical data to assess the
importance (or otherwise) of genomic islands of diver-
gence.

GermSomaSegregation
ESEB Symposium on \Early germ-soma segregation"
Dear Colleagues:
We would like to invite you to attend and contribute
to the ESEB-sponsored symposium \Evolutionary con-
sequences of an early germ-soma segregation", to take
place at the 14th Congress of the European Society for
Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in Lisbon, Portugal, 19
- 24 August 2013. The abstract submission deadline is
28 February!
Invited Speakers: Norman Arnheim (University of
Southern California, USA) \Germline selection and the
paternal-age eect in humans."
Andrew Bourke (University of East Anglia, UK) \Early
germline segregation and social group transformation"
Organisers Duur K. Aanen (Wageningen University)
Rick Michod (University of Arizona)
Summary: It has been 25 years since Leo Buss rst
proposed that an early segregation of a germ line from
the rest of the body is an adaptation to limit the scope
for selsh cell lineages. A number of recent discoveries
make it timely to reevaluate this hypothesis. This sym-
posium explores the evolutionary stability of multicel-
lularity in organisms with and without an early germ-
line sequestration, to discuss the relative importance of
this characteristic for conict resolution, in multicellu-
lar growth and, more generally, in other major transi-
tions such as the transition to eusociality.
Description Most animals segregate, early in develop-
ment, a small number of germ cells that are destined to
give rise to reproductive cells, from somatic cells. Only
a few cell divisions separate the germ cell from the ga-
mete stage and germ-cell division is strictly regulated.
It has been nearly 25 years since Leo Buss proposed that
these individual-level adaptations reduce the scope for
within-individual selection, at which level selection of-ten will be deleterious for individual tness. The early
germ-soma segregation thus prevents conict between
selection at the level of the individual and selection
at the level of the cell. There is much empirical sup-
port for this hypothesis. However, it has been argued
that the regular single-cell bottleneck observed in most
life cycles in combination with a low mutation rate is
sucient to limit intra-individual genetic variation re-
quired for among-cell selection. Furthermore, recently
some cases have been identied that show that the
germ-soma segregation does not provide perfect pro-
tection against lower-level selection. First, contagious
cancers, transmitted horizontally from one individual
to another, circumvent the germ line. Second, recently
a mechanism has been discovered by which inherited
diseases, caused by de novo mutations in the father's
germ line, are positively selected. Normally, male germ
cells divide asymmetrically, with one daughter cell be-
coming the new germ cell, and the other giving rise to
multiple gametes. However, some mutations increase
the frequency of symmetrical division of the germ cells,
thus increasing the number of germ cells with this mu-
tation. This explains an observation, already made in
the early 1900's, that the incidence of some inherited
diseases increases with the age of the father. On the
occasion of these new discoveries, this symposium will
discuss the importance of germ-soma dierentiation for
resolution of the potential conict between the levels of
selection in a multicellular individual. This symposium
will bring together students working on the evolution of
multicellularity and conict resolution, both in organ-
isms with and organisms without an early germ-soma
dierentiation, such as fungi. It will discuss the impor-
tance of an early germ-soma dierentiation for conict
resolution relative to other stabilising factors, especially
high among-cell genetic relatedness, seen in most mul-

ATTACK AND DEFENSE: EVOLUTIONARY AND

Description: Antagonistic interactions are widespread
in nature, most notably in the context of infectious
disease, where hosts and pathogens play out an on-
going and ever-escalating battle for survival. Under-
standing how genetic and environmental factors inu-
ence the spread of disease and the evolution of host
and pathogen traits is a topic that unies ecologists,
evolutionary biologists, and epidemiologists. Accurate
predictions about both the ecology and evolution of in-
fection are notoriously dicult, and an important con-
tributing factor is that individuals vary, often substan-
tially, in their responses to infection: genetic variation
for infection success and within host resistance and tol-
erance are well described; environmental conditions of-
ten interact with genetics to produce variable, and un-
predictable, infection outcomes; males and females fre-
quently show distinct responses to infection, with im-
plications for both the spread and evolution of disease;
individual variation in host behaviour and contact net-
works repeatedly result in disease outbreaks that would
not be predicted from the average behaviour of the
population. The current challenge lies in incorporat-
ing empirically observed variation into theoretical mod-
els dealing with the ecology and evolution of disease,
and to go further, and link these predictions to disease
spread and evolution in the wild. With this synthesis
in mind, this symposium will bring together theoretical
and empirical approaches across a broad range of bi-
ological systems, to embrace individual level variation
in host-pathogen interactions, and its population-level
consequences. We are especially excited about work
linking both theoretical and experimental approaches
in disease evolution, and those that extend laboratory
studies of infection to disease spread and evolution in
natural populations.

Dear Colleagues,
we would like to remind you that the deadline is
approaching for abstract submission to the sympo-
sium on * MULTIGENE FAMILY EVOLUTION IN
THE POST-GENOMIC ERA: TOWARDS A POPU-
LATION GENOMIC APPROACH TO MHC EVOLU-
TION *. Please see below for further details. Abstract
submissions will be accepted until 28th of February

Description: Multigene families, like the MHC, encodecentral components in pathways involved in individual
tness and are key to important adaptations. Eluci-
dating the molecular processes involved in their evolu-
tion is an important issue to further our understanding
of the genetic basis of biological diversication. With
this symposium we aim at bringing together researchers
studying the functional genomics, evolutionary ecology
and population genomics of MHC to discuss the most
recent developments in each of the elds and develop
new ideas and future research directions that integrate
the dierent branches of MHC evolution in particu-
lar and multigene family evolution in general. Contri-
butions presenting an integrative approach or ndings
with signicant relevance to such will be given prior-
ity. We explicitly encourage also submissions presenting
integrative research on multigene families other than
MHC.

MolecularInnovations
We are pleased to invite you to the sympo-
sium *\MOLECULAR EVOLUTIONARY INNOVA-
TIONS" *that will be held at the XIV congress of the
European Society of Evolutionary Biology 2013 from 19
to 24 August in Lisbon, Portugal, and would be hon-
ored to receive your abstract submission.
*Symposium summary:* Evolutionary innovations, in-
cluding evolution of new functions, bear the hallmarks
of genome plasticity. The comparison of ever-increasing
number of sequenced genomes in dierent species has
expanded our ability to discover molecular evolution-
ary novelties, to study their origin, their dynamics
and long-term fates in genomes. In this symposiumMarch 1, 2013 EvolDir 17
we will address the evolution of these events, focus-
ing in particular in studies that discovered and traced
them down (from whole genome duplications to single
gene duplications), mechanisms involved in their advent
(exon shuing, gene fusion, or ssion, domestication of
transposable elements, exaption of coding or noncod-
ing sequences and lateral gene transfer...), the dynamics
and fate of novelties (contribution to the neofunctional-
ization or subfunctionalization events, gene repertoires
preferentially retained, patterns of gene family expan-
sion, mode of evolution they followed for their main-
tenance), as well as the tools allowing their retrieval
and/or the comparison of such genes at the genomic
level. We will also put emphasis on those detailing
changes at the molecular and cellular levels, up to those
showing behavioural impact.

SYMPOSIUM DETAILS We would like to invite you
to attend and contribute to the ESEB-sponsored sym-
posium \Mechanisms of Trade-os", to take place at
the 14th Congress of the European Society for Evolu-
tionary Biology (ESEB), in Lisbon, Portugal, 19 - 24

INVITED SPEAKERS *Stephen C. Stearns (Yale Uni-
versity) *Joost Keurentjes (Wageningen University)
ORGANIZERS *Bas Zwaan (Wageningen University)
*Thomas Flatt (University of Lausanne)
SNYOPSIS Trade-os are of major importance in evo-
lutionary theory, in particular in life history theory,
since they are thought to impose constraints upon the
response to selection: trade-os occur when an evolu-
tionary change in a trait that increases tness is cou-
pled to an evolutionary change in another trait that de-
creases tness. Because organisms are often restricted
in terms of resource acquisition, one of the major phys-
iological explanations for the existence of trade-os is
dierential resource allocation between competing func-
tions/traits. Recently, however, molecular data have
challenged the validity of this view, even though both
views may be compatible with each other. Unfortu-
nately, up-to-date, trade-os have either mostly been
approached from a purely phenotypic perspective with-
out much attention to the underlying physiological andgenetic mechanisms, or conclusions about trade-os
have been drawn from molecular studies without suf-
cient consideration of the functional/organismal phe-
notype. In this symposium we aim to bridge these
views by linking our current knowledge of the molecular
and physiological pathways with what has been learned
about quantitative genetic and phenotypic correlations
among traits. Understanding the mechanisms underly-
ing trade-os and their evolutionary consequences will
require an integrative approach, and it is the major aim
of our symposium to help foster such an integration.

Dear Colleagues -
We are pleased to announce that the fourth annual
Manchester Molecular and Genome Evolution Sympo-
sium will take place on Friday 17th May 2013. The
remit of the symposium is broad and will include all
aspects of molecular and genome evolution, ranging
from computational algorithm development to wet-lab
experiments investigating the molecular basis of tness.
The symposium will be a day-long event consisting of
two plenary lectures, a series of contributed talks, and
a poster session. Plenary lectures will be given by Prof.
Judith Mank (UCL) on \Sex-specic selection and the
genomic basis of sexual dimorphism" and Dr. Lisa
Crossman (TGAC, Norwich) on \Crowdsourcing out-
break genomics: E.coli 2011 and Chalara Ash Dieback".
We encourage anyone interested to attend the sympo-
sium and, if they wish, to submit an abstract. We are
particularly keen to give PhD students and post-docs a
chance to present their work. The best abstracts will
be selected to give talks with the remainder invited to
present posters. All contributed talks and posters will
also be considered for a prize, presented at the drinks
reception following the symposium.
There are limited places so please register for
the symposium online at the URL: http://-

cepts form an essential basis for modern evolutionary
studies. The goal of the MCEB conference (at its 5th
edition) is to bring together scientists with diverse back-
grounds to present recent advances and discuss open
problems in the eld of mathematical and computa-
tional evolutionary biology. This year a special focus
will be given to the applications to health, for example
with regard to human and cancer genomics, genetic dis-
eases and virus epidemics. General concepts, models,
methods and algorithms will also be presented and dis-
cussed, just as during the previous conference editions.

Mar23-24
The Midwest Ecology and Evolution Conference is an
annual migratory conference that is student hosted and
attended from institutions located in the Midwestern
United States. The conference supplies an excellent
opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students
to present data in a regional setting, and to be able to
network with other students from nearby universities.
The conference also presents an excellent opportunity
to practice speaking in a low pressure atmosphere com-
pared to large, national conferences, and is more easily
accessible for universities without funding for travel to
large conferences.
This year the conference will be hosted at the University
of Notre Dame on March 23-24, 2013. Keep yourself up
to date by checking back on this website regularly, as
well as liking our facebook page. More information on
registration to come.

cjmprog e.html The last decade has seen important
progress in our understanding of the causes and
consequences of the evolution of genetic systems
(the structure of the genetic material and its modes
of transmission) both on theoretical and empirical
grounds. This progress partly derives from the de-
velopment of new methods and technologies such as
genomics and bioinformatics, new statistical methods
to explore macroevolutionary patterns, new biological
systems for experimental evolution, or studies of the
molecular basis of shifts in reproductive systems. At
the same time, theoretical and population studies have
continued to provide important insights. The goal of
this conference is to bring together researchers using
these dierent approaches to study various aspects of
genetic systems, including the evolution of sex and
recombination, inbreeding vs. outcrossing and the
evolution of sexual dimorphism, in order to pinpoint
important parameters that need to be measured and
determine how new forms of data can be used to
make progress on important, yet unsolved evolutionary
questions.
The conference will be organized in six sessions:
Advantage of sex and recombination: recent develop-
ments on the evolutionary benets of genetic mixing.
Biology of sexual and asexual reproduction: phyloge-
netic distribution of sexual and asexual lineages; prox-
imate mechanisms inducing shifts in reproductive sys-
tems. Evolution of inbreeding vs. outcrossing: theoret-
ical and empirical work on the evolution of mating sys-
tems. Evolution of sexual dierentiation: the evolution
of separate sexes and sexual dimorphism. Evolution
of sex chromosomes: genetic determination of sex in
plants, animals and fungi Open session: other aspects
of genetic system evolution

Uppsala GeneticsAdaptation Apr6
Genetics of Adaptation Symposium Saturday 6 April
2013 Evolutionary Biology Center Uppsala University,
Uppsala, Sweden
The genetics of adaptation has a rich history, with the-
oretical foundations in the modern synthesis. This his-
tory also includes a great deal of empirical support, such
as the seminal work dening ecotypes by Gote Turre-
son of Uppsala, Sweden. Since then, a major focus has
been ecological and quantitative genetic approaches to
identify the traits and loci that are responsible for adap-
tation. More recently, the availability of genome-wide
polymorphism and divergence data has revealed adap-
tive evolution at many loci, in many species.
This one-day symposium will include research on both
trait based and population genetic approaches, with the
goal of closing the gap between researchers taking these
2 approaches to the genetics of adaptation.
Speakers Andrea Betancourt, Vetmeduni Vienna Hans
Ellegren, Uppsala University Adam Eyre-Walker, Uni-
versity of Sussex Corbin Jones, University of North

BiodiversityPlantMicrobe
PhD position: Biodiversity of Plant-Microbe Inter-
actions We are seeking a PhD candidate interested
in studying the biodiversity in microbial communities
associated with plants. This exciting research area
is one of four pillars of investigation in the recently
awarded Cluster of Excellence in Plant Sciences (CE-
PLAS; www.ceplas.eu/en). This cluster is located in
the Duesseldorf/Cologne area of Germany and aims to
understand the evolution of complex traits in plants.
The specic goal of this three year PhD project is to
investigate which species of oomycetes and protists live
within roots and shoots of Arabidopsis and close rela-
tives. Standard molecular markers will be used to de-
tect these organisms from DNA extractions of plant
tissue. Phylogenetic methods will be applied to classify
these organisms. If possible, these species will be cul-tured. These cultures will serve as the starting point
of several follow-up studies. Culturable isolates will be
re-inoculated onto hosts to determine how they aect
plant growth. To follow the infection process and life-
cycle of these microorganisms, a uorescent label will
be incorporated into the microbe (when possible) and
the infection and endophytic life will be investigated
microscopically. Additionally, whole genome sequenc-
ing of these isolates will be performed to serve as the
basis of comparative genomic and evolutionary studies
on these novel endophytes.
Applicants should have a Master's degree or equiva-
lent in biology or a closely related eld. Previous lab-
oratory experience and coursework in organismal bi-
ology is explicitly required. The student should have
a strong foundation in evolutionary biology, systemat-
ics and ecology and excellent communication skills in
English. The student will be co-advised by Prof. M.
Bonkowski and Prof. L. Rose. Please visit these web-
sites to learn more about the individual labs:

oekologie/agbonkowski/MB-Web1.htm#people or
www.popgen.hhu.de/en/unser-team The closing date
for applications is Feb. 28, 2013, or when the position
is lled. Applicants should send a single PDF le
containing: a 1 to 2 page essay describing your previous
research experience and career goals, a curriculum
vitae, and contact information for at least two referees

PhD student in Quantitative Genetic Models of Com-
plex Traits
The Danish Centre for Genomic Selection in Animals
and Plants (GenSAP) is seeking a motivated and pro-
ductive PhD student to study quantitative genetic mod-
els of complex traits.The goal of GenSAP is to develop the next genera-
tion genomic breeding tools for genetic improvement
schemes in agricultural plants and animals. GenSAP
brings together Danish breeding companies and re-
search groups as well as leading international research
groups to make a joint strategic research eort to build
the foundation for next generation genomic selection
(GS). GenSAP will develop GS methodologies across
all agricultural species and integrate and extract rel-
evant information from the massive amounts of data
emerging from whole genome sequencing, functional
genomics, epigenomics and complex phenotyping tech-
nologies. Improved GS models will be developed based
on ecient algorithms accounting for e.g. gene-by-gene
and gene-by-environment interactions. Advanced com-
putational tools for optimizing and evaluating selection
decisions based on in silico data will be developed to
ensure a sustainable long-term implementation of GS.
The successful candidate will be aliated to two Gen-
SAP partner institutions: North Carolina State Uni-
versity and Aarhus University. The candidate will be
enrolled in the PhD program in Genetics at North Car-
olina State University, under the mentorship of Prof.
Trudy Mackay and is expected to spend 1-2 years of
the PhD study at the Center for Quantitative Genetics
and Genomics, Aarhus University, under the supervi-
sion of Prof. Daniel Sorensen and Senior Scientist Peter
Srensen.
The candidate will develop novel computational ap-
proaches to exploit and integrate multiple layers of
genome-wide experimental data, in order to provide
novel insights into the genetic architecture of com-
plex traits and improve predictive models of complex
traits. The candidate will apply these methods to phe-
notypic and molecular data sets from the Drosophila
melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel, a population of
200 fully sequenced inbred lines. This position requires
solid quantitative skills, preferably including experience
with population genetics or statistics. Skills in scripting
and/or programming would be useful.
The studentship oers a generous stipend, with full

Closing date: February 28, 2013
You will test competing hypotheses of diversication
for explaining the outstanding diversity in tropical
America (including soil specialisation, temperature in-
creases, polyploidy, habitat shifts, biome conservatism
and range expansion). To achieve this goal you will
carry out extensive eldwork in Latin America, es-
pecially the tropical Andes and Amazonia, to collect
plant and soil samples. You will then produce molec-
ular data using next-generation sequencing techniques.
Your analyses will include estimation of phylogenies,
divergence times, species trees from gene trees, diversi-
cation rates, species distribution modelling, and bio-
geographic reconstructions.
The choice of plant group will depend on the candi-
date's previous experience and interests (e.g. during the
Masters project). Ideally, the study group should have
a wide Neotropical distribution with a centre of species
diversity in northern South America, have been recently
revised taxonomically, be already relatively well col-
lected, and included in phylogenetic analyses. Please
indicate your suggestion of plant group in the motiva-
tion letter (this is recommended but not mandatory).
Good communication skills (written and spoken) in En-
glish are necessary. Priority will be given to those can-
didates who have co-authored at least one scientic
publication. Fieldwork experience in the tropics, ex-
perience working with molecular phylogenetics and/or
next-generation sequence data, and language skills in
Spanish and/or Portuguese is advantageous. We are
seeking a candidate who is independent, self-motivated,
and interested in the use or development of new meth-
ods and approaches, in short, a person willing to go
beyond the state-of-the-art in the eld. We will at-
tach great importance to personal characteristics and
independence in learning and working, creativity and
documented productivity.

is oering a
PhD position
in the group of Evolutionary Ecology of Marine Fishes
The PhD student will be employed in a DFG-funded
project about the eect of parental care on evolution-
ary ecology of immune defence dynamics. The project
leader is Dr. Olivia Roth (GEOMAR, Kiel) in collab-
oration with Prof. Walter Salzburger (Zoological Insti-
tute at the University of Basel, Switzerland). A close
cooperation with a second PhD student in the same
project is expected.
Project description:
In species with conventional sex roles females usually
display a more ecient immune defence than males and
only females transfer immunity to the ospring. Un-
der increased paternal care, these principles may fall.
We want to investigate this in two sh families with
a parental investment gradient, syngnathids and cich-
lids. With a combination of eld studies (in Northern
Europe and Africa) and laboratory manipulation ex-
periments we want to address strength of immune de-
fence and its inducibility using immunological assays
and large-scale gene expression.
The aim of this project is to enhance our understand-
ing of selection pressures for immune defence evolution
and determine the eect of parental care on immuneMarch 1, 2013 EvolDir 37
defence dynamics and parasite defence.
The GEOMAR, the University of Kiel and the Max
Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl on of-
fer a stimulating research environment with focus on
evolutionary biology. The PhD student will have the
possibility to join one of our two graduate schools,
either the International Max-Planck-Research School
(IMPRS) \Evolutionary Biology" or the \Integrated
School of Ocean Sciences" (ISOS). Kiel is the capital of
the most Northern state of Germany, directly located
at the coast of the Baltic Sea. The town oers many
opportunities for leisure activities, in particular people
enjoying watersports will love the environment.
Expectations:
The successful candidate is required to have a Mas-
ter or Diploma in Biology, to be highly motivated, to
have outstanding social skills and the ability to inter-
act with a team of researchers. A background in evo-
lutionary ecology and the knowledge of immunological
and/or molecular biology methods are desired. In ad-
dition, the candidate should enjoy snorkeling both in
cold and warm waters and stand long eld days. Expe-
rience in sh handling and aquaria experiments would
be a plus.
Salary according to Tv ~AD 13 (65 %), the project dura-
tion is three years. The working environment is English
speaking.

Iceland EvolArcticCharr
*Opportunity for a Ph.D. study in Evolutionary Ecol-
ogy of Arctic charr in Iceland *
H olar University College (Prof. Bjarni K. Kristj ansson
and Prof. Sk uli Sk ulason), seeks a Ph.D. student to
study Evolutionary Ecology of small benthic Arctic
charr (*Salvelinus alpinus*) in Iceland.
Measuring and understanding biological diversity is a
key factor in how humans interact with wild nature.
This is especially true now as this interaction has re-
sulted in great changes in nature. This is especially
obvious for freshwater where knowledge of global di-
versity of shes is limited. Studies have shown that
diversity within species of Icelandic freshwater sh is
considerable, especially among populations and morphs
adapted to specic habitats and food. The evolution
of this diversity is rst and foremost because of di-
verse and rich freshwater systems, e.g. because of
volcanism, tectonic drift and low competition among
species. Thus, Iceland oers unique opportunities to
study the ecological factors that promote populations
change,formation of intraspecic morphs and even new
species.
The project focuses on the relationship between eco-
logical factors in the environment and the evolution
of diversity in behaviour, growth and morphology of
local small benthic charr in Icelandic freshwater sys-
tems. Studies have shown that in Iceland there are
numerous populations of small benthic charr that have
evolved independently in isolated freshwater systems.
These systems are commonly cold water springs within
the volcanic active zone. The parallel evolution of the
small benthic charr populations gives us unique oppor-
tunities to study the rst steps in the evolution of di-
versity and speciation. This knowledge is important
for the interpretation of the importance of freshwater38 EvolDir March 1, 2013
sh biodiversity in Icelandic rivers and lakes. This is
a key to sensitive managing and use of these systems.
In 2012, we started a three year project on dwarf charr
in lava caves around M yvatn, funded by the Icelandic
Centre for Research, Rann s. The present study we
will add to that project focusing on two distinct fresh-
water systems, with a number of small benthic charr
populations. In the project, population sizes will be es-
timated, and the relationship between ecological vari-
ables and growth, behaviour and morphology will be
studied. We will estimate how these factors change
temporally, within and among years, to estimate nat-
ural selection. Furthermore, genetic relatedness within
and among populations will be estimated.
The position is funded by Orkuranns oknarsj our and
will be lled as soon as a good candidate is found (tar-
get date 1. May 2013).
The student will be located at H olar University College
and registered at University of Iceland. The Depart-
ment of Aquaculture and Fish Biology, H olar University
College, is situated in Skagafj ordur, North Iceland, and
is an international centre for research, instruction, and

LundU AvianEvolutionaryEcolUrban ecology: The impact of trac-related pollution
for genetic and non-genetic adaptation of detoxifying
systems in wild birds
PhD studentship (4 years), Lund, Sweden Lund Uni-
versity/ Biological institution Supervisor: Dr Caroline
Isaksson, Co-supervisor: Prof. Staan Bensch
It is well known that humans living in areas with high
levels of trac-related pollution show increased inci-
dence of oxidative stress related diseases such as can-
cers, pulmonary and cardio-vascular diseases. Previ-
ously it has been shown that birds living in polluted
areas have elevated antioxidant responses, which may
result from an increased oxidative stress. However,
the underlying mechanisms that mediate this response
and the consequences thereof at the individual- and
population-level remain unknown. To investigate the
fundamental mechanisms behind oxidative stress the
present project will use an interdisciplinary research
approach that combines physiology, molecular biology,
toxicology, and evolutionary ecology using replicated
urban/rural pairs of wild bird populations.
The studentship will be under the umbrella of the above
project description but depending on the applicant's in-
terest and previous experiences, we will together tailor
a PhD plan within this framework. Thus, we seek a
highly motivated and bright student with strong inter-
est in evolutionary ecology. Previous experience with
avian eld work (ringing and blood sampling), molecu-
lar and/or physiological lab work is advantageous.
The eldwork will mainly be based in southern Swe-
den (Scania), however, trips across Sweden and Europe
is also planned. Field work will occur throughout the
year, thus you need to be prepared for lots of physically
demanding outdoor activities in good and bad weather.
A driving license at the start of the position is essential
as it will be required for the eldwork starting in April
2013.
The student will be based at the Department of Biology
Lund University (http://www.biologi.lu.se/). The de-
partment oers a stimulating international environment
with weekly journal clubs, lab meetings and seminars
with invited international and national speakers. The
lab oers state-of-the-art equipment for molecular work
and Lund University oers excellent infrastructure with
regards to electronic journals, internet support, student
support, and PhD courses. The working language is
English.
This studentship is funded 50% by the Swedish research
council (Vetenskapsr adet, VR) to Dr C Isaksson and
50% by the unit Evolutionary Ecology. Full funding is
available for the project, but the student is encouraged40 EvolDir March 1, 2013

Abstract of the PhD project:
Invasions are considered as natural experiments of evo-
lutionary processes because they often involve strong
selection and drift. The spotted wing Drosophila (D.
suzukii), a crop pest, is simultaneously invading Europe
and the USA. We propose to take advantage of this sit-
uation to investigate the pace of phenotypic evolution
of D suzukii along a latitudinal gradient, and study in
real time the relative eects of local selection and drift
on the phenotypic and genetic variation. We will com-
bine geometric morphometrics, evolutionary quantita-
tive genetics and Next-generation sequencing (NGS).
To evaluate evolutionary potential and divergence, G
matrices of various phenotypic traits will be estimated
for several populations and contrasted to the neutral
molecular dierentiation. The project will involve eld
work (in Europe and possibly Asia) and insects rearing.
The Natural History Museum (www.mnhn.fr) is situ-
ated right in the centre of Paris, next to Universit e
Pierre & Marie Curie (Paris 6), and a short walk from
Ecole Normale Sup erieure. The Natural History Mu-
seum has recently enjoyed an intensive campaign of re-
cruitment of young researchers in all aspects of biodi-
versity and evolutionary research, and Paris as a whole
has a vibrant research community in the life sciences.
A strong background in evolutionary biology is re-
quired. Knowledge in multivariate statistics and/or
quantitative genetics is desirable. Experience in molec-
ular biology and/or bio informatics is a plus.
Informal contact with Vincent Debat or Celine Teplit-
sky are encouraged.

Eectiveness of Mitigation to Reduce Road Mortality
of Massasauga Rattlesnakes
The project will be co-supervised by Dr. Stephen
Lougheed (Queens University, Kingston) and Dr.
Jacqueline Litzgus (Laurentian University, Sudbury).March 1, 2013 EvolDir 41
The student can choose to enrol at either university.
The project is a partnership among the two universi-
ties and the Friends of Killbear Park, and is partially
funded by a Species at Risk Stewardship Fund grant
from the OMNR.
Killbear Provincial Park has been involved in research,
conservation, and education outreach eorts regarding
the provincially Threatened Massasauga Rattlesnakes
for the past 20 years. The Park has taken signicant
steps to reduce road mortality of Species at Risk reptiles
by constructing four ecopassages and erecting fencing
to divert snakes through the ecopassages and under the
roads. This provides a unique opportunity to study the
eectiveness of ecopassages and to test their practical-
ity for use in the general landscape on existing and pro-
posed new roads to reduce road kill impacts while en-
suring habitat connectivity across the landscape. The
specic objectives of the project are to: 1. determine
if road mortality declines in the area of fencing and
ecopassages; 2. determine if rattlesnakes use the eco-
passages; 3. determine how many individuals use the
ecopassage in a given season; 4. determine whether
rattlesnakes change their movement patterns by cross-
ing roads in new areas to avoid the ecopassages and
fencing; 5. monitor and assess the population of Mas-
sasauga Rattlesnakes at Killbear Provincial Park and
ascertain population trends to determine if the fencing
and ecopassages are having a negative or positive ef-
fect on snake populations. While the focus at Killbear
is specically on rattlesnakes, the lessons learned may
also be applicable to other species at risk such as East-
ern Foxsnakes, Blanding's Turtles, or Snapping Turtles
which are also found in the park and might be detected
using the ecopassages.
Interested candidates should submit a cover letter out-
lining relevant experience, CV, and unocial tran-
scripts to both Drs. Lougheed (lough@queensu.ca) and
Litzgus (jlitzgus@laurentian.ca) via email. Review of
applications will begin 1 March 2013 and will continue
until a suitable candidate is identied. Fulltime eld
work (with a eld assistant) will commence in spring
2013, and the student may start their MSc program in
either May or September 2013.

plant neighbors may aect the strength of interactions
between the plant and insect herbivores or between her-
bivores and their natural enemies. The aim here is
to develop and test theory on consumer responses to
mixed resource patches; where non-hosts or alternative
hosts may aect the probability of attack on a specic
resource. The basis for the studies is theory that trans-
lates information about the physiological and behav-
ioral processes involved in host search to probabilities
of nding and consuming hosts in mixed patches. The
thesis work will involve studies of insects that use olfac-
tory cues for host nding, including both behavioural
and physiological studies. The work may also involve
model studies on insect search.

ButteryThermalSensitivity
A 3.5 year PhD project is available at the University of
East Anglia, Norwich, UK investigating \Understand-
ing thermal sensitivity of male fertility in butteries".
The successful applicant will be based in the research
group of Prof. Matt Gage (m.gage@uea.ac.uk).
Applications must be received in full by 28th February
2013. Further details and information on how to
apply can be found at http://www.uea.ac.uk/study/-
postgraduate/research-degrees/science/biological-
sciences . Project Description Male fertility is
specically fragile to increases in temperature that
organisms often experience in the natural environment.
This sensitivity has been well known for decades
in homeotherms: adaptations that allow testicular
cooling of 2 to 8oC below core body temperature in
mammals, for example, are essential to allow normal
male fertility, and experiments where gonadal or am-
bient temperatures were elevated revealed subsequent
declines in male fertility (review in Setchell 1998).
This thermosensitivity of male fertility is now increas-
ingly recognised in cold-blooded poikilotherms, whose
physiology is more directly aected by environmental
thermal change. In Drosophila fruities, for example,
it is the specic thermal sensitivity of male fertility
that makes populations non-viable above 30oC as this is
the threshold where males (not females) become ster-
ile (David et al. 2005). Because of climate warming
and increases in heatwave frequencies, we need to know
what reproductive traits in males are damaged by heat,
whether they can acclimate or harden' and recover, if
local adaptation has evolved, and ultimately the con-
sequences for population viability. This PhD project
will address these questions in a group where good evi-
dence for local extinction under climate warming exists:
butteries.
Using laboratory culturing and experimentation with
temperate zone satyrid buttery species, sourced from
warmer and cooler natural regimes, the PhD will deter-
mine (1) the specic eects of heat stress on male re-
productive function at dierent life stages under dier-
ent thermal regimes, (2) whether temperature-adapted
sub-populations within species exist, and (3) the extent
and rate of acclimation and recovery of male fertility.
We will measure form, function and number of eupyreneMarch 1, 2013 EvolDir 43
and apyrene sperm after thermal treatments at dierent
life stages, in parallel with male behaviour, fertility and
sperm competitiveness following experimental matings.
Male reproductive eects will be measured in parallel
with female eects (which for most species so far exam-
ined show much reduced sensitivity to equivalent heat
stress). Once controlled experiments have isolated the
details of hyperthermia on male reproductive function
in the lab, we will take this information to the eld,
and measure natural fertility across spatial and tem-
poral thermal ranges within species. At the project
conclusion, we aim to have identied in an important
taxon: which fertility phenotypes are damaged by heat
stress, how they are damaged, the developmental plas-
ticity and ability of these phenotypes to recover, and
ultimately whether this specically sensitive individual
male trait could explain why some buttery populations
have disappeared from their southern ranges.
The student will join an active, NERC-funded re-
search environment, in which the supervisors fo-
cus on studying the evolution and ecology of ani-
mal reproduction in the lab and eld (e.g. Wedell
et al. 2002, Thomas et al. 2006, Michalczyk

interests at www.uea.ac.uk/bio/People/Academic/-
Matthew+Gage and www.uea.ac.uk/environmental-
sciences/people/facsta/francoa). Techniques applied
will include buttery rearing, mating and behaviour
assays (in UEA's new Constant Environment Facil-
ity), microdissection, microscopy and image analysis
(in UEA's excellent Bio-imaging suite), experimental
design, eldwork, project management and statistical
analysis, as well as all the core skills demanded by an
exciting multidisciplinary PhD project.

postgraduate/research-degrees/science/biological-
sciences . Project Description When environments
vary over time and space individuals can be mis-
matched' - in an environment to which they are not
adapted. In the short term, individuals may show
plastic responses, which can buer deleterious eects.
Given sucient evolutionary time and selection, or-
ganisms will also adapt genetically. This project aims
to explore these ideas in a novel conceptual framework
developed from hominin evolution.
Modern human life histories were selected in a very dif-
ferent environment to that now experienced in indus-
trialised countries. This very recent mismatch' may ex-
plain the rapid and continuing rise in obesity and type
2 diabetes. The thrifty genotype' hypothesis proposes
that individuals selected in an environment of periodic
food shortage will be ecient storing fat when food is
plentiful. However, in environments in which food is
in continual excess, such a genotype is maladaptive. A
second variation on this idea is plasticity to the pre-
vailing environment (thrifty phenotype'). Here, dur-
ing development, the likely quality of the environment
into which the individual will emerge is assessed'. Thus
traits such as insulin sensitivity are plastic and can be
set' during development. However, if the environment
changes rapidly, the organism is set for the wrong en-
vironment, with deleterious consequences.
These ideas have untapped potential and broad rele-
vance for the ecological domain. The aim is to exploit
this by investigating untested predictions of the thrifty
phenotype and genotype hypotheses, using ecologically
relevant manipulations of diet in the fruity model sys-
tem. The main aims are:
1. To measure genetic variation in thrifty genotype'
This hypothesis proposes that increased eciency of
fat storage is advantageous when food supply is vari-
able / scarce. The PI's lab created 3-fold replicated44 EvolDir March 1, 2013
experimental evolution lines over 10 years years ago in
which food supply is either regular' or random'. The
random lines experience periods of starvation and glut
and should therefore be selected for high eciency fat
storage. Total lipid storage and circulating sugars levels
will be quantied. The full life history (lifespan, repro-
ductive output) of the random and regular regimes will
also be characterised.
2. To measure genetic variation in the expression of
thrifty phenotype'
In additional experimental evolution lines we have repli-
cated regimes that experience good quality food dur-
ing development, but emerge onto either a high or low
quality adult diet. Hence low adult diet individuals are
mismatched' over evolutionary time. We will conduct
the tests above to determine the signicance of these
mismatches.
3. To measure the extent of plasticity in matching' of
genotype to phenotype
The student will create proximate mismatches between
developmental and adult environments by placing co-
horts of wild type individuals on dierent larval and
adult diets. This will show the extent of plasticity to
mismatched environments. The full range of tests will
be conducted as above.
Training: The student will enter UEA's personal and
professional development programme. Through this
they will gain personally tailored training in generic
skills, career development and employability. Specic
skills include analysing responses to experimental evo-
lution, life history assays, biochemical tests of nutrient
levels and quantitative analyses.

PhD position: Polyploidy and immunity in Neotropical
catshes.
A three year PhD project is available at the University
of East Anglia, Norwich, UK investigating the role of
polyploidy in immunity in Neotropical catshes. The
successful applicant will be based in the research group
of Dr Martin Taylor (www.uea.ac.uk/~b141).
Project Description. Ancient whole genome duplica-
tions (WGDs) and the additional genetic resources re-
sulting from them have played major roles in the evo-
lution many eukaryotes. In vertebrates, there is strong
evidence that two rounds of ancient WGD were followed
by a third additional WGD in the teleost shes - the
sh specic genome duplication (FSGD). The role that
WGD plays in the evolutionary success of recipient taxa
and lineages has been hotly debated for many decades.
However, while progress has been made in understand-
ing the origins and mechanisms of the formation of
polyploids in many groups, less attention has been de-
voted to the advantages and/or disadvantages of being
a polyploid. This PhD project will investigate two re-
lated facets of individual tness - immune gene diver-
sity (the MHC) and macroparasite burden, in a group
of neotropical catshes (the Corydoradinae) that have
undergone multiple WGDs, ranging from ancient pale-
opolyploid events ( ~40 mya) to relatively recent dupli-
cations ( ~1-2 mya). The Corydoradinae are widely over
South America and comprise more than 170 described
species divided into 9 lineages. The group demon-
strate multiple genome duplication events (polyploidy)
and also exhibit complex mimetic colour pattern re-
lationships1. Using sympatric communities of species
(which should theoretically be exposed to the same par-
asites) that vary in ploidy level, this project will: 1)
use next generation sequencing to quantify MHC di-
versity in taxa that range from diploid to potentially
16x ploid; (2) quantify macroparasite burdens in mul-
tiple sympatric communities consisting of diploid and
polyploid species (3) investigate the role of additional
host-specic factors that may inuence macroparasite
burdens such as size, age, diet and population demo-
graphics. The successful applicant join the group of Dr
Martin Taylor who has recently moved to UEA (see 2)

A 3.5 year PhD project is available at the University

postgraduate/research-degrees/science/biological-
sciences . Project Description Every organism has
a nite amount of resources it can use to survive
and reproduce. Resources spent on one area, e.g.
health, cannot be spent on another, e.g. reproduction.
Consequently organisms must work out how best to
spend their resources so as to maximise the benets
they gain. Such trade-os are central to the evolution
of dierent life-history strategies, i.e. why organisms
dier in aspects such as size, reproduction rate and
lifespan, a fundamental part of biology. The problem is
that, although it is relatively easy to assess the benet
of investment in an area, to understand trade-os we
also need to know the costs. Unfortunately, measuring
these has proved to be extremely dicult, especially in
wild animals.
Telomeres are long, specialized regions of DNA whichprotect the ends of chromosomes and prevent the genes
from getting damaged or mixed up when the cell repli-
cates. However, a section of telomere is lost with each
replication and when telomeres reach a critical short
length the cell stops functioning. Accumulation of these
dysfunctional cells in the bodies' tissues contributes to
organismal senescence and mortality. Importantly the
rate at which telomeres shorten is also greatly aected
by oxidative stress - the organisms' inability to cope
with the damaging waste particles of metabolism. Fur-
thermore, oxidative stress/telomere shortening is inu-
enced by life history and environmental stresses (e.g.
accelerated growth or infection). Telomere shortening
can, therefore, indicate the biological cost that such
stresses exact on an individual and provide an impor-
tant link between these and the aging process.
The student will use the unique Seychelles warbler
(SW) system1-3 to undertake a longitudinal study of
telomeres in a wild population. The long-term study
of an isolated island population means we have de-
tailed information on the factors experienced by in-
dividuals each year, linked to annual blood samples
taken from those individuals. We also have accu-
rate measures of survival and reproductive success3.
We recently developed a method to measure telom-
eres from blood samples4 and have shown that telom-
ere shortening reects biological ageing in the SW:
telomere shortening with age diers between individ-
uals and predicts survival and recruitment5. The pro-
posed PhD will now investigate the relative costs of dif-
ferent stresses/experiences by relating annual telomere-
shortening rate to the stresses they have faced in that
year.
Experimental manipulations will allow them to hone in
on specic factors, i.e. reproductive eort and help-
ing behaviour. Importantly comparisons, not only be-
tween stresses, but also in respect to the age and life-
history stage at which they are experienced, can be
made. This will allow the student to compare how the
costs and benets of investment in dierent life-history
components, or in dealing with environmental stresses,
are traded o. Finally, the student will test the idea
that individual variation in telomere shortening reects
an individual's ability to withstand these stresses and,
therefore, provides an indicator of individual quality.
The student will be involved in all aspects of eld and
laboratory work and collaborate with an international
team of researchers working on the SW.

UExeter CrayshGenomics
PhD studentship: Identifying virulence factors in
two highly pathogenic aquatic Aphanomyces species -
causative agents of craysh plague and epizootic ulcer-
ative syndrome
The genus Aphanomyces is responsible for two OIE no-
tiable diseases in animals: craysh plague and epi-
zootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). Craysh plague is
a devastating and fatal disease of freshwater craysh
species and is responsible for the decline of native cray-
sh throughout the whole of Europe. It currently
threatens to wipe out the white-clawed craysh, the
UKs only native species, which is now on the IUCN
list of threatened species 2012. The causative agent
is the oomycete protozoan Aphanomyces astaci, which
arrived in Europe in the late 19th century via the in-
troduction of North American craysh, which can carry
the disease without displaying any disease symptoms.
EUS in sh is caused by another Aphanomyces species:
A. invadans. This parasite has led to large sh mor-
talities in Asia, Australia and more recently Africa,
with substantial economic impact for the aected ar-
eas. There is a real danger that A. invadans will be in-
troduced to the UK through the ornamental sh trade.
As A. invadans is an aquatic pathogen that can infect
most, if not all, sh species, the consequences for sh
in the UK could be devastating.
Despite their importance, very little is known about
pathogenicity mechanisms and virulence factors. As A.
astaci causes a fatal disease in European craysh but
not in North American species, host-specic factors areexpected to play an important role in the disease mech-
anism. Oomycetes such as Aphanomyces are among the
most important groups of disease-causing organisms in
both agriculture and aquaculture and thus represent a
threat for global food security and biodiversity. There
are currently no control treatments or control measures
available for these pathogens.
The aim of this project is to begin to understand
the biology of the causative agents of craysh plague
(A. astaci) and EUS (A. invadans), using genomics
and transcriptomics. The aim of the PhD is iden-
tify and analyse putative virulence factors and host-
specicity factors in order to understand the evolu-
tion of these pathogens. Bioinformatics methods will
be used to analyse nucleotide sequence data gener-
ated with state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing
methods and there will be the opportunity to develop
new computational tools to identify and compare viru-
lence factors between Aphanomyces species and other
oomycetes.
This award provides annual funding to cover UK/EU
tuition fees, a stipend, payment for 110 hours of work

Fully funded NERC PhD studentship on the evolution
of cooperation in humans at the University of Exeter,

Title: The eects of demography and migration on co-
operation and competition in humans
Supervisors: Dr. Shakti Lamba and Prof. Michael
Cant
Full details of studentship:
http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/-
?id=1162 *Project Description*:
The aim of this project is to examine whether demo-
graphic features of populations, particularly dierent
patterns of migration, aect the degree and scale of co-
operation amongst individuals. Cooperation, dened
in the evolutionary sciences as behavior that benets
others at a cost to the actor, is a cornerstone of human
social organization. The degree and scale of coopera-
tion varies considerably across human populations and
many authors have attributed this variation to cultural
dierences. However, it remains unclear what drives
this cultural variation. A substantial body of theory in
evolutionary biology predicts that demographic char-
acteristics of populations, such as their size and pat-
terns of migration, may be important drivers of coop-
eration and competition. The PhD candidate will test
these models in populations of two small-scale societies
in India using a combination of economic games, be-
havioural surveys and quantitative observations. The
project will involve extended periods of research in eld
conditions in rural India. The candidate will acquire
key transferable skills in experimental design, survey
design, eldwork and multi-level statistical modelling.
The study is particularly topical as it addresses debatesabout the eects of migration on the social structure
and cohesion of societies.

Graduate Research Assistantship position at the
McGuire Center for Lepidoptera, Florida Museum of
Natural History (FLMNH)
A Graduate Research Assistantship (RA) position is
available for a starting MSc or PhD student at the
University of Florida's Department of Biology or De-
partment of Entomology and Nematology. The RA
will be based at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera of
the Florida Museum of Natural History, and will form
an integral part of the team working on the project
\ARTS: Phylogeny and systematic revision of the di-
verse and cryptic Euptychiina (Lepidoptera, Nymphal-
idae, Satyrinae)". This NSF-funded project will build
phylogenies using morphology, Next-Gen and tradi-
tional molecular data, and revise the species- and
genus-level systematics of the Euptychiina, one of the
most diverse radiations of butteries in Neotropical
lowland forests and grasslands.
The successful candidate will be expected to complete
a monographic systematic revision of one of several pri-
ority Euptychiina genera for their thesis research. The
student will use both morphology and modern molec-
ular methods, including receiving training in next-
generation sequencing and bioinformatics, to infer phy-
logenies and delimit species, and will revise the clas-
sication with descriptions of new taxa where neces-
sary. The student will also have excellent opportunities
to broaden their research into the elds of biogeogra-
phy, evolutionary ecology and conservation. The stu-
dent's assigned work will include curatorial tasks rel-
evant to the project, including preparation, identica-
tion, databasing, digital imaging, integration and or-
ganization of Euptychiina buttery specimens in the
FLMNH.
The ideal candidate should be highly motivated and
have a proven ability to conduct eld- or collection-
based studies of butteries or another diverse organis-
mal group, and a demonstrable enthusiasm to pursue
their own research into the systematics of butteries.Familiarity with the geography of the Neotropical re-
gion, an interest in tropical ecosystems and experience
with curating insect collections would be valuable.
The RA is available for two years and includes an an-
nual stipend, health insurance contribution and tuition
waivers for all semesters. In addition, there is potential
funding for eld trips to South America, to visit mu-

mence on 30th September 2013. The studentship will
cover tuition fees and provide a tax-free home bursary
($13,726 in2013/14) for a UK/EU student for 3 years.
Aim of the project What are the factors promoting
the evolution of male care of the ospring, infanticide
and sibling rivalry? What are the evolutionary conse-
quences of such behaviour on reproductive and life his-
tory traits? This project investigates questions on how
behaviour inuences the evolution of reproductive and
life history traits in mammals, as predicted by parent-
ospring conict theory and sexual conict theory. You
will also test hypotheses on the role of social and eco-
logical factors in promoting the evolution of these be-March 1, 2013 EvolDir 49
haviours. You will build a large database containing
behavioural data for numerous mammalian species and
employ a range of phylogenetic comparative methods
to test relevant hypotheses. This is a bioinformatics
project with no experimental or eld work involved.
This interdisciplinary project is based on previous re-
sults on the evolutionary architecture of reproduction
in female mammals (Capellini et al. 2011 Am Nat, Bar-
ton & Capellini2011 PNAS) and expands it by includ-
ing behaviour. This project bridges across evolutionary
biology, behavioural ecology and reproductive biology,
and oers the opportunity to gain fundamental theoret-
ical and critical thinking skills, learn an array of cutting
edge statistical methods and acquire several transfer-
able skills. You will work within a highly stimulating
environment in the School of Biological, Biomedical and
Environmental Sciences at the University of Hull. The
University of Hull also oers a range of modules on re-
search and transferable skills for postgraduate students.
Please contact Dr Capellini (I.Capellini@hull.ac.uk) for
further information or if you have any question.

ULausanne EvolutionMelanism
PhD position at the Department of Ecology and Evo-50 EvolDir March 1, 2013
lution in the group of Prof. Alexandre Roulin
Association between melanism, physiology and be-
haviour: a role for the melanocortin system
The melanocortin system is implicated in the expres-
sion of many phenotypic traits. Activation of the
melanocortin MC1 receptor by melanocortin hormones
induces the production of brown/black eumelanic pig-
ments, while activation of the four other melanocortin
receptors aects other physiological and behavioural
functions including stress response, energy homeostasis,
anti-inammatory and sexual activity, aggressiveness
and resistance to oxidative stress. We recently proposed
the hypothesis that some melanocortin-physiological
and -behavioural traits are correlated within individ-
uals. This hypothesis predicts that the degree of eume-
lanin production may, in some cases, be associated with
the regulation of glucocorticoids, immunity, resistance
to oxidative stress, energy homeostasis, sexual activity,
and aggressiveness. Studies performed in the barn owl
are consistent with the hypothesis that covariations be-
tween melanin-based coloration and other phenotypes
are due to the melanocortin system. A very important
step to demonstrate this hypothesis is to perform ge-
netic studies using samples of free-living barn owls. The
aim of this PhD is therefore (1) to look for polymor-
phism in the coding sequence of genes belonging to the
melanocortin system and (2) to measure their expres-
sion levels. This study will be done also in interaction
with circadian rhythm and a number of environmen-
tal factors. This PhD will oer a unique opportunity
to combine eld and lab work. Potential candidates
should have a strong interest in evolutionary biology.
(S)he should enjoy eld work (carried during the day
but also often at night) and have very good experience
in molecular work. Very good knowledge of R-Statistics
is required as well as the ability to write scientic pa-
pers. The PhD can start immediately and will last
between 3 and 5 years.

enrolment.
One PhD scholarship will aim at elucidating the genetic
basis of impulsive aggression in dogs. Dog aggression
often results in serious injuries, psychological trauma,
and creates concerns about dogs' welfare. The risk is
higher in cases of impulsive aggression in which there
are few premonitory signs. Although impulsive aggres-
sion has been well described in terms of behavioural
and physiological characteristics, little is known about
its genetic basis. In this project, a genome-wide as-
sociation study will be performed to identify genetic
polymorphisms associated with the tendency to dis-
play impulsive-aggressive behaviour. Dogs used in the
project will be behaviourally phenotyped using a vali-
dated impulsive aggression scale. The genome-wide as-
sociation study will be followed by more detailed testing
of candidate genes showing high association with ag-
gressivity, to establish a direct link between gene func-March 1, 2013 EvolDir 51

ULincoln EvolutionBlackGrouse
The University of Lincoln (UK) will be funding multi-
ple PhD studentships in Life Sciences from 2013. As
part of this programme, Carl Soulsbury is advertising
an open competition for a full-time PhD opportunity
to work on \The role of telomere length and attrition
rates in the evolutionary ecology of black grouse".
A successful student will be based in the research group
of Carl Soulsbury (csoulsbury@lincoln.ac.uk) and have
co-supervision by Tom Pike (University of Lincoln) and
Heli Siitari (University of Jyvaskyla, Finland).
Background: Telomeres are regions of tandem-repeated
DNA sequences typically located at the ends of chro-
mosomes and which protect them from deterioration
during replication. Telomeres shorten with age and the
rate at which they shorten (telomere attrition) is be-
lieved to be due to factors such as oxidative stress,
which damages telomeres and impairs repair. Once
telomeres reach a critical length, cells can no longer di-vide leading to apoptosis. Hence, telomere length can
be connected to total or remaining lifespan, and for
some species, tness.
The black grouse is a lekking species with very high
reproductive skew and high investment in multiple sex-
ual ornaments and behaviours. This project will com-
bine existing and new DNA samples with detailed
individual-based long term data (e.g. reproductive ef-
fort, sexual ornament size, reproductive success, para-
site loads) to test the importance of telomere length,
telomere attrition rates and the relative importance of
dierent telomere classes (Class I, II, III) in the evolu-
tion of life history strategies.

The University of Lincoln (UK) will be funding mul-

part of this programme, the Laboratory of Evolutionary
Ecology of Adaptations, led by Dr. Daniel Pincheira-
Donoso, is advertising an open competition for a full-
time PhD opportunity to work on the ecology of sperm
competition, ideally starting September 2013.
This project aims to investigate the inuence of eco-
logical factors, such as climate, interspecic competi-
tion and resource abundance, on sperm competition
through the evolution of traits involved in postcopula-
tory sexual selection. Given the energetic costs involved
in male investment into sperm competition, ecological
factors are expected to play an important role in sperm
competition dynamics, and thus, macroecological clines
in sperm competition strategies are expected to evolve
across environments. This theory will be tested using
the Liolaemus lizard adaptive radiation (one of the most
species-rich genera of terrestrial vertebrates on earth)
as a model system. Adapted to one of the widest cli-
matic and ecological ranges known among living rep-
tiles, Liolaemus oers a unique model organism to in-
vestigate questions involving phylogenetic comparative
explorations of clinal evolution. Important part of the
data is already maintained in the Laboratory, and op-
portunities for further data collection in South America
will be discussed in due course.
The project will benet from co-supervision by Drs.

The physiology of an insect ear capable of detecting

Director of studies: Dr. Fernando Montealegre-Z

Co-supervisor: Dr. Jose Gonzalez-Rodriguez (Univer-

Male katydid (Insecta) produce sound to call distant
females. They have a tympanal organ in the forelegs
that helps them to hear their conspecic calls, but
also to detect the echolocation cries of their predators,
the bats. Dr. Montealegre-Z recently discovered that
the katydid tympanal organ operates like the mam-
malian ear, having external, middle, and inner ear com-
ponents. Their inner ear contains a newly identied
organ, the Auditory Vesicle, a uid-lled cavity that
baths the ear mechanoreceptors and facilitate the dis-
persion of waves and frequency analysis like the mam-
malian cochlea. The proposed study will investigate
the ears of neotropical katydids that communicate us-
ing the highest calling frequencies ever recorded in the
animal kingdom. While humans can only hear up to
20 kHz, males of these insects serenade their ladies at
150 kHz. These ears must be ultra-sensitive to miti-
gate sound attenuation at such extreme frequencies. In
mammals the cochlear uids have unique ionic composi-
tion to regulate electrochemical impulses of mechanore-
ceptors; changes in composition can harm hearing sen-
sitivity. The project aims at elucidating the role of the
AV uid in hearing sensitivity and seeks to untangle the54 EvolDir March 1, 2013
amplication process, whereby the females ears consti-
tute sensors with sophisticated detection capabilities.
This project involves eldwork and lab experimenta-

example of evolution driven by intra-genomic conict is
the case of genomic imprinting where conict between
paternally inherited and maternally inherited genes in
the same individual results in silencing of one gene but
not the other (1).
Recently, genomic imprinting (and intra-genomic con-
ict in general) has been linked to several diseases
(2). For example, deletion of the PWS/AS cluster of
imprinted genes causes Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
when the deletion is paternally inherited but Angelman
syndrome (AS) when it is maternally inherited (3). Theclinical phenotype, regarding appetite and activity lev-
els, of children suering from these syndromes is the
reverse: poor sucking and low weight in children with
PWS but insatiable appetite and obesity in children
with AS (3).
This intriguing reversal of the clinical phenotype of a
deletion is best explained in the light of conict between
genes with dierent parental origin. In particular, it
can be explained when paternally inherited copies favor
a greater allocation of maternal resources to ospring
than the maternally inherited copy does (4). We are
interested in further exploring the role of intra-genomic
conict in disease. Can we predict the risk of develop-
ing diseases caused by genes in conict? Can we suggest
epigenetic modications that may palliate some symp-
toms?
In this project we will formulate mathematical mod-
els for the evolution of intra-genomic conict and make
specic predictions about the outcomes. We will test
the predictions of our models against the medical lit-
erature. This research will require a trans-disciplinary
approach that uses mathematical and computational
models to synthesize the elds of molecular biology, ge-
netics, medicine, evolutionary biology, and behavioral
ecology. We hope to apply this approach to understand
the evolution of genomic imprinting, sex-determination,
and disease virulence among others.
This project is suitable for candidates with some back-
ground or experience in mathematical modeling or sim-
ulation at undergraduate level. We are looking for can-
didates, either with a background in the life sciences,

UOslo DiseaseEvolution
A 3-year position as PhD Research fellow in disease
ecology is available at the Centre for Ecological and
Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES), Department of Bio-
sciences, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.
The PhD student will be part of the projectChanges and Zoonotic Epidemiology in Wildlife Sys-
tems (ZEWS) funded by the Norwegian Research Coun-
cil as part of the NorKlima Program. The position is
tentatively available from May 1st 2013.
Project Description
Among the most serious eects of climate change is
its potential to drastically alter the ecology of diseases
that are vectors-borne, have wildlife and/or environ-
mental reservoirs (WVE diseases). Theory and obser-
vation suggest that gradual changes in abiotic factors
that inuence transmission rates or host/vector suscep-
tibility, and host or vector density can result in sudden
tipping points in which the epidemiological character-
istics of a disease rapidly change, leading to large-scale
epidemics. The understanding required to plan and
implement mitigation strategies for WVE diseases re-
quires broad interdisciplinary collaborations to provide
the necessary integration and overview of all WVE dis-
eases likely to respond to climate change.
As part of this international eort, the PhD student will
be working on three systems that are important in their
own right while being complementary as model systems:
Lyme disease, anthrax and tularemia. They are chosen
for either being; (a) currently or potentially important
in Scandinavia, (b) likely to respond strongly to climate
change, and (c) giving complementary perspectives on
how WVE diseases respond to climate change.
Specically, the PhD will be working on
Improved risk models of these three diseases, for a num-
ber of climate scenarios. Identication and Acquisition
of new data where critical information is found to be
missing. The candidate will be expected to work on all
three project systems, with a particular focus on an-
thrax, though with room for adjustment depending on
the skills and wishes of the candidate.
Requirements
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has
a strategic ambition of being a leading research faculty.
Candidates for these fellowships will be selected in ac-
cordance with this, and expected to be in the upper
segment of their class with respect to academic creden-
tials.
We are seeking for a candidate who has completed a
Masters or other corresponding education equivalent to
a Master degree in disease-related ecology and micro-
biology. The project will call for a strong background
in practical microbiology and zoonotic disease ecology.
The candidate must have a proven record of highly in-
dependent eldwork. Prociency and experience in col-
lection, analysis and storage of environmental samples58 EvolDir March 1, 2013
and population (mostly ungulate) surveillance is rec-
ommended. It necessitates both practical experiences
in doing research on class A environmental pathogens
in the eld and eld laboratories as well as familiarity
with desert environments.
The announced position involves development of new
theoretical predictions to investigate current and future
patterns of disease distribution, prevalence and evolu-
tion. A willingness to learn statistics and computa-
tional and modeling skills are thus essential. The can-
didate should also expect to have to learn new sequenc-
ing methodology. An interest in fundamental research
and the ability to communicate and work in a multidis-
ciplinary team are essential. Being willing and capable
of spending extended periods doing relevant eldwork
under potentially isolated conditions in Namibia and
Scandinavia is also essential, and due to the nature of
the work the candidate should have demonstrated pro-
ciency in working in relevant eld conditions.
The purpose of the fellowship is research training lead-
ing to the successful completion of a PhD degree.
The fellowship requires admission to the PhD pro-
gramme at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sci-
ences. The application to the PhD programme must be
submitted to the department no later than two months
after taking up the position. For more information see:

projectProle.aspx?psr=79&pid=324 Dispersal is
one of the most important processes driving the
dynamics and structure of marine communities, local
adaptation of species, and maintenance of genetic
diversity. Additionally, a thorough knowledge of
dispersal patterns is essential for the eective spatial
management of sheries and the design of marine
protected areas (MPAs). However, inferring patterns
of demographic connectivity in marine species with
long-lived pelagic larvae remains a challenging task.
Several approaches and types of data have been used
to study connectivity. Genetic approaches typically es-
timate rates of gene ow while micro-chemical nger-
printing is used to assign individuals to source popula-
tions. More recently it has been possible to obtain esti-
mates of connectivity from biophysical models of ocean
circulation and larval transport. However, all methods
are challenged by the large spatial scale at which dis-
persal in marine species takes place and by the sheer
size of populations of marine organisms. There are good
examples of studies that have successfully characterised
dispersal patterns at a small spatial scale but the same
is not true for large geographic areas. No single method
or data type has proven successful in this latter case
and it has become clear that there is a need for statis-
tical approaches that combine all available sources of
information.
The thesis project is aimed at developing Bayesian ap-
proaches to estimate connectivity using all available
data and in particular genetics, microchemistry, and
output from larval transport models. Some of the sta-
tistical techniques necessary to achieve this goal have
been developed by Oscar Gaggiotti's group (see refer-
ences below) and will be used to develop new and im-
proved methods for the estimation of connectivity pat-
terns.
The ideal candidate would have a good background in
statistics and an interest in population genetics and
computational biology. The focus of the project is on
statistical developments and data analysis so it does not
include lab or eldwork. However, there will be close
collaborations with empirical population geneticists.

Scholarship available for a PhD project in Plant Virol-

PhD project: \Wind spread of plant viral pathogens
into northern Australia"
This project will provide ideal opportunities for obtain-
ing advanced training in genomics and plant virology.
We are seeking a highly motivated student to inves-
tigate this exciting project on establishing the extent
and signicance of viruses with wind-borne insect vec-
tors arriving from nearby countries and establishing in
northern Australia. This project will provide ideal op-
portunities for obtaining advanced training in genomics
and plant virology. The hypothesis being tested is
that economically important plant viral pathogens of
agricultural and horticultural crops or natural ecosys-
tems are arriving in Australia via wind-borne insect
virus vectors blown across the sea from Indonesia/East
Timor/Papua New Guinea by prevailing wind currents.
The connectivity between isolates of the same virus
from East Timor or from Northern Australia will be
investigated to provide evidence for this hypothesis,
and document the occurrence in crops of our Northern
neighbours of additional damaging viruses that have
not yet reached Australia.
This project will be the rst ever investigation to pro-
vide solid research data regarding the within-species
relatedness (i.e. connectivity) between pathogens or
pests found aecting the crops of our northern neigh-
bours and those of Australia itself. The simplicity of
virus genomes and the recent advent of deep sequencing
technology make such a study feasible, and a suitable
subject for a PhD investigation. The project will use
the latest, cutting edge deep sequencing technologies
and state of the art virus characterisation technologies.
UWA will provide state of the art virus characterisation
technologies. DAFWA will provide its unique capacity
for rigorous large-scale eld data collection in northern
Australia and sample processing. CSIRO will provide
its world-class capability in genomics and bioinformat-
ics, in addition to spatial informatics tools delivered
through the Atlas of Living Australia infrastructure.
The Plant Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre
is oering an annual stipend of $30,000 a year tax-
free, plus approximately $13,000 additional support
a year towards operating expenses. The duration
of the scholarship is three and a half years (maxi-

ference, attendance at an annual student workshop,
and formal professional development. Students must

Starting date May 2013
Background:
This project arises because of (i) the threat to Aus-
tralian agricultural and horticultural crops, and to its
natural ecosystems posed by arrival of damaging new
pests and pathogens via wind currents coming from In-
donesia/East Timor/PNG, and (ii) the increasing oc-
currence and intensity of such wind currents likely to
occur as a consequence of global climate change. Ev-
idence that virus arrival by this means has already
occurred comes from the Ord River Irrigation Area
(ORIA) where genome analysis of aphid-borne Zuc-
chini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) revealed that this is
the only place in Australia where the southeast Asian
ZYMV strain occurs (Coutts et al. 2011, Arch. Virol.
156, 2119-2131). This ZYMV strain would have arrived
in the ORIA via viruliferous aphids carried on wind
currents. The prevailing winds arriving in the ORIA
are from Timor. The parts of northern Australia being
considered in this project are the ORIA and the Dar-
win/Katherine agricultural regions, both of which are

UppsalaU HumanPopGenet
PhD-student position in human population genomics at
Uppsala University
Project description: Modern humans emerged in
Africa, although the process by which modern humans
arose has been vigorously debated. Human migra-
tion and the exodus from Africa some 70,000 yearsago are closely tied with east Africa because the tra-
ditionally favored model of the migratory route out of
Africa for anatomically modern humans runs through
east Africa. This project focuses on deciphering the
population history and patterns of genetic variation
among east African populations, which today display
substantial ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity. The
successful candidate will use large-scale population ge-
nomic data from multiple of east African populations to
understand the history of human occupation of eastern
Africa.
The PhD student will be part of Dr. Mattias Jakob-
ssons lab at the Evolutionary Biology Center at Upp-
sala University. The Jakobsson lab has a broad inter-
est in population genetics and human evolution and
use a combination of mathematical studies of popu-
lation genetic models and computational approaches
to understand the complex patterns of large-scale hu-
man genetic variation and their implications for hu-
man demographic history. See the Jakobsson lab
page for more information about current research and
publications: http://www.ebc.uu.se/Research/IEG/-
evbiol/research/Jakobsson/ Qualications: An MSc or
possibly a BSc degree (or equivalent) in a relevant eld
is required. The ideal candidate is highly motivated
with thorough education and strong interest in evolu-
tionary genetics/genomics, population genetics and hu-
man evolution. Previous experience with large-scale ge-
netic data analysis, bioinformatics, and programming is
advantageous. Mathematical, computational and sta-
tistical training is also advantageous.

Project description: Polyploidy, or whole genome du-
plication (WGD), occurs in virtually all vascular plants
and has played a major role in evolution. In your PhD
project you will take advantage of the recent develop-
ments in sequencing technology and previous studies in
the Capsella genus to characterize genomic and phe-
notypic changes associated to WGD in the shepherd's
purse (C. bursa-pastoris), a recently formed tetraploid
weed. You will rst conduct whole-genome resequenc-
ing and gene expression studies of accessions from Eu-
rope and from China. In a second step, the associa-
tion between genomic variation and putative adaptive
traits will be assessed through association and linkage
mapping. These data, together with data in its diploid
relatives, will be used to address questions about the
genomic consequences of WGD between species and
between groups of accessions within species and ques-
tions on the consequences of WGD for putative adap-
tive traits. Part of this work will be done in close co-
operation with research groups in Canada and China.

*Field Assistant Needed** for Behavioural Ecology
eldwork in Texas, April-May 2013*
* **Closing date: Wednesday March 13th 2013*March 1, 2013 EvolDir 73
We are seeking a eld assistant for 4-6 weeks start-
ing mid April 2013, to help with a social insect be-
havioural ecology eld study in southern Texas, USA.
This is a collaborative project between the Institute of
Zoology at London Zoo, and Queen Mary University of
London. We work on an unusual and fascinating pol-
linator species, the Mexican honey wasp (see http:/-
/www.texasento.net/Brachygastra.htm). These wasps
live in large paper nests in the area and share many
behavioural features with honeybees. The project will
focus on their foraging behaviour. We will work with
live wasps, setting up articial feeders, and carrying
out video observations and dissections, so the success-
ful candidate will gain excellent rst-hand experience
of behavioural ecology eldwork.
Accommodation will be in a trailer shared with other
members of the research group with shower, cooking fa-
cilities, etc., at a university extension centre in a small
town. The eld assistant will be part of a team with
one principle investigator and one PhD student. Air
fare (from the UK) and accommodation expenses will
be provided, so each applicant will need to pay only
their own food/personal expenses, which are relatively
cheap in Texas.
Working conditions can be hard, in very hot temper-
atures, so applicants must have a tness level suitable
for eldwork, and most importantly, an enthusiastic in-
terest in evolutionary biology. *A driving license, valid
passport and at least one year's driving experience is
essential; applicants must also be over 21 to satisfy car
insurance requirements.*

NSF Director EvolutionaryProcesses
The NSF is seeking candidates for Program Director
in the Evolutionary Processes and the Systematics and
Biodiversity Science Clusters within the Division of En-
vironmental Biology (DEB), Directorate for Biological
Sciences (BIO) in Arlington, VA. The closing date for
applications is March 15, 2013.
The Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) supports
fundamental research on populations, species, commu-
nities, and ecosystems. Scientic emphases range across
many evolutionary and ecological patterns and pro-
cesses at all spatial and temporal scales. Areas of re-
search include biodiversity, phylogenetic systematics,
molecular evolution, life history evolution, natural se-
lection, ecology, biogeography, ecosystem services, con-
servation biology, global change, and biogeochemical
cycles. Research on origins, functions, relationships,
interactions, and evolutionary history may incorporate
eld, laboratory, or collection-based approaches; obser-
vational or manipulative experiments; synthesis activi-
ties; as well as theoretical approaches involving analyt-
ical, statistical, or simulation modeling.
The Evolutionary Processes Cluster supports research
on microevolutionary processes and their macroevolu-
tionary consequences. Topics include mutation, gene
ow, recombination, natural selection, genetic drift,
assortative mating acting within species, speciation,
and long-term features of evolution. These investiga-
tions attempt to explain causes and consequences of
genetically-based change in the properties of groups of
organisms (at the population level or higher) over the
course of generations as well as large-scale patterns ofevolutionary change, phylogeography, origin and main-
tenance of genetic variation, and molecular signatures
of evolution at the population or species level. The clus-
ter seeks to fund projects that are transformative { that
is, those that will change the conceptual bases of evolu-
tionary biology and have broad implications for future
research. Both empirical and theoretical approaches are
encouraged. The Cluster is comprised of two programs,
Evolutio nary Genetics and Evolutionary Ecology; pro-
posals should be submitted to one of these programs.
The Systematics and Biodiversity Sciences Cluster sup-
ports research that advances our understanding of the
diversity, systematics, and evolutionary history of or-
ganisms in natural systems. This research addresses
fundamental questions in biodiversity, taxonomy, and
phylogenetics, such as: What kinds of organisms ex-
ist in the natural world? How are they related? How
did evolution lead to patterns of global biodiversity in
time and space? How can phylogenetic history shed
light on evolutionary patterns and processes in nature?
Example topics include: expeditionary biodiversity re-
search and discovery; identication and classication
of organisms; and phylogeny and comparative phyloge-
netic biology. The SBS Cluster seeks to fund projects
that are transformative - that is, those that innova-
tively and fundamentally transform our approaches to
analyzing and understanding global biodiversity, its ori-
gins, distribution, and evolutionary history. The Clus-
ter places a high value on integrative and holistic ap-
proaches to systematics research and training - i.e.,
those approaches and projects that integrate across all
the components within the cluster (biodiversity discov-
ery, organismal biology, taxonomy, phylogenetics, and
evolution) and that train highly integrative systema-
tists who can conduct research across the entire spec-
trum of these activities.
The responsibilities of the Program Director include
long-range planning and budget development for the
areas of science represented by the program or pro-
gram cluster, the administration of the peer review pro-
cess and proposal recommendations, the preparation of
press releases, feature articles and material describing
advances in the research supported, and coordination
and liaison with other programs in NSF, other Federal
agencies and organizations.
Applicants must possess a Ph.D. in biology or a re-
lated eld with an emphasis in evolutionary or system-
atic biology. In addition applicants must have six or
more years of successful research, research administra-
tion, and/or managerial experience beyond the Ph.D.
in this scientic area.
These are full time, permanent positions with a 1276 EvolDir March 1, 2013
month salary of $105,211 to $163,957 per year, sta-
tioned in Arlington, VA. Applicants must be US Citi-
zens or permanent US residents who are actively seek-
ing citizenship.

JDRF/WELLCOME TRUST DIABETES AND IN-
FLAMMATION LABORATORY
The JDRF/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inammation
Laboratory (DIL; https://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/ )
has been at the forefront of recent international success
in discovering the genetic variants associated with type
1 diabetes and their function. We are now working to
understand the mechanism through which genetic vari-
ation can inuence disease risk both through studies
of healthy individuals who carry genetic susceptibility
variants and within the context of intervention trials
with individuals with new onset diabetes.
We require an experienced statistician with an estab-
lished track record to join our statistics group (https:/-
/www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/sta/dilstats/ ), which is a
friendly group of Bayesians and frequentists who anal-
yse a diverse range of low and high dimensional data, in-cluding ow cytometric, gene expression, genotype and
sequencing data. Our challenge is to integrate analy-
ses of these data to address the research aims of the
DIL. The DIL is located in the Cambridge Biomed-
ical Reasearch Campus and we are building strong
collaborative links with the MRC Biostatistics Unit
(http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/ ) under its recently
appointed director, Professor Sylvia Richardson.
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in statistics or a
closely related discipline, several years postdoctoral ex-
perience, excellent statistical programming skills, and
an ability to communicate and present results both to
other statisticians and scientists. She or he will be ex-
pected to have some supervisory responsibility for the
more junior post docs in our group. Knowledge of ge-
netics or type 1 diabetes is less important than an inter-
est in applying the innovative statistics we have found
necessary when dealing with data generated by rapidly
developing technologies, in order to answer questions of
importance to biology and health.
Senior Research Associate status may be available for
suitable candidates subject to Faculty Board approval.

Alberta GroundSquirrelVolunteer
Field Assistants Required-Columbian ground squirrels
Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada
We are looking for up to 6 volunteers to assist with eld-
work for the period of April 10 to Aug 31, 2013. The
project investigates the evolutionary and behavioural
ecology of Columbian ground squirrels. As a member
of the study, assistants will be involved with monitor-
ing the phenology (when animals emerge from hiberna-
tion), reproduction and survival of individuals. Field-
work will involve live-trapping and handling of animals,
radio-telemetry, behavioural observation and assistance
with the measurement of physiological (metabolism)
traits on free-ranging animals. This is an excellent op-
portunity to gain experience working with a collabo-
rative research team on a long-term study of a wild
mammal.
All eldwork is carried out in the spectacular Rocky
Mountains of southwestern Alberta, Canada, home to
some of the most majestic wildlife in North Amer-
ica. We will be staying at the University of Calgary's
R.B. Miller research station in Sheep River Provin-
cial Park, Alberta ( http://bgs.ucalgary.ca/facilities/-
facilities). You will interact with other researchers
working with ground squirrels on a diversity of projects
in behavioural and population ecology. Additionally,
the eld station is home to a number of other re-
searchers working on a variety of projects, ranging from
insects to large mammals. Food, and accommodation
are provided. Volunteers are required to provide for
their own travel to either Edmonton or Calgary, Al-
berta. Travel between the eld station and one of these
centres is provided.
Training will be provided and no experience is neces-
sary, but candidates should have an interest in a num-
ber of the following (the more the better!): ecology,evolutionary biology, wildlife, eld biology, and animal
behaviour. Periods of time will be spent camping and,
as such, successful applicants need to enjoy the out-
doors, be up-beat, positive, responsible and work well
as a member of a team.
If you wish to apply for one of these posts then please
send a CV with a cover letter and contact details for
three references (with e-mail addresses), by email to

Massive open online courses in
evolution answers
Hi again evoldir!
Awhile back, I asked evoldir about evolution-related
online courses. The following is a list that included the
responses. There may be others out there.
I've also learned that the Society for the Study of Evo-
lution's education committee is exploring online educa-
tional platforms for a possible consolidated 'course' as
an agenda item.
It seems there is a lot of open potential for more open
online education and public engagement around evo-
lution! However, it's already clear that specic design
considerations have to be taken to broaden engagement
among minority and underrepresented learners.
Please do get in touch with me if this is broadening
evolution learning online is something you are working
on or are interested in pursuing.96 EvolDir March 1, 2013

Other: Mini-ARTS grant
The Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) is pleased to
announce the availability of awards for revisionary tax-
onomy and systematics, modeled after the NSF Dear
Colleague Letter: Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy
and Systematics (ARTS) recently developed within the
Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster. We are
calling these mini-ARTS grants. These awards are
designed to allow SSB members (students, post-docs,
and faculty) to spend a summer or semester appren-
ticed to an expert in a particular taxonomic group or
to enhance revisionary taxonomic and systematics re-
search in novel ways. Goals of this award program
are to address constraints on our knowledge of unde-
scribed biodiversity, assist in passing on taxonomic ex-
pertise before it is lost, increase the number of stu-
dents with broad training in organismal biology and
systematics, and support projects in biodiversity and
taxonomy informatics as well as monographic and re-
visionary taxonomy. Activities can include a trip to
the taxonomists laboratory, pay for the taxonomist to
visit the applicants laboratory for a period of time, or
pay for costs of computer time or development of inter-
active keys for electronic dissemination of systematics
results. Requests for support may be in any amount up
to $3,000. We will fund two or three of these awards this
year. Please visit NSFs website http://www.nsf.gov/-
pubs/2011/nsf11037/nsf11037.jsp for more information
about their ARTS program.
How to apply V a complete application includes: 1)
a brief description of the project, including a separate
section justifying the importance of the taxon and the
revisionary work; 2) an itemized budget; 3) the appli-
cants CV; and 4) a letter of support from the taxonomic
expert or collaborator. If the applicant is a student
or post-doc, please also include a reference letter from
the advisor. Applicants may be from any country, but
MUST be members of SSB, and are advised to join
the Society as soon as possible to facilitate their appli-
cations (to join go to: http://systbio.org/?q=node/6).
The narrative part of the application should be no more
than two pages, including the budget, but not including
the curriculum vitae and letter(s).
Grant applications should be sent to Sean Brady, Chair
of the SSB Awards Committee (bradys@si.edu). E-March 1, 2013 EvolDir 97
mail submissions are required, and applicants should
use pdf format for all documents. In the subject line
of the email, please indicate the SSB award category as
mini-ARTS. All documents, INCLUDING ALL SUP-
PORTING LETTERS, must be received by March 31,
2013 for consideration.

PLANTS undergrad travel awards
The PLANTS program (funded by the NSF and Botan-
ical Society of America, www.botany.org) encourages
the participation of undergraduates from underrep-
resented groups at the annual meetings of the BSA
and aliated organizations (this year in New Orleans,
Louisiana, July 27-31, 2013). These meetings focus on
the plant sciences and include areas such as ecology,
conservation, systematics, paleobotany, physiology and
ethnobotany. The PLANTS program will fund up to 12
undergraduates annually to participate in the meetings
and to receive mentoring from both junior (advanced
undergraduate and graduate students) and senior men-
tors (postdocs, faculty, and other professionals) in theplant sciences.
Applicants will be asked to provide a one page state-
ment of academic interests and career goals and rel-
evance of the BSA meetings to these goals, and
one letter of recommendation. The letter of refer-
ence should indicate the student's level of interest in
the plant sciences and how inclusion of the student
will increase diversity of the PLANTS participants.
Applications will be accepted Feb 1-Mar 15, 2013
and are available at www.botany.org/awards grants/-
detail/PLANTS.php Applicants must be undergradu-
ates who are US citizens or permanent residents and
who are registered or recently graduated (i.e., within
the last 12 months) from U.S. institutions, including
Puerto Rico, and traveling to the meeting from within
the U.S. Students demonstrating a need for funds to at-
tend BSA will be given preference, and will be selected
so that the group as a whole will maximize diversity
among undergraduates at the meetings.

Phylobases on Bioportal
Im a little sorry to bother the community with such a
simple request, but I have not been able to work it out
by reading papers or contacting people
If I wish to make a simple Bayesian nucleotide phy-
logeny in Phylobayes on BioPortal where I would like
to, say,
- Run the analysis for 1,000,000 generations - Do two
separate runs - Run 6 parallel chains - Sample each 3rd
tree - Use a CAT-GTR model - Use a burnin of 1000
trees
then can anybody enlighten me/come up with a sug-
gestion as to how I should perform this - or another
useful Phylobayes nucleotide analysis - writing on the
relevant Bioportal page as seen below?
I am aware that Phylobayes diers from MrBayes and
runs about 100-1000 cycles each time it saves a tree.
One should be able to perform a specic number of cy-
cles using the -x option and write something like this:
./pb -d myle.phy -x 1000000 -cat -gtr outputle1 &

Anthropologists had a name for the non-independence-

\Galton's Problem", and the promise of comparative

for the eld of cultural phylogenetics. In this talk I will
show how linguistic, cultural, and archaeological data is
used in comparative phylogenetic analyses. The \trea-

The Ernst Mayr Award is given to the presenter of the
outstanding student talk in the eld of systematics at
the annual meetings of the Society of Systematic Biolo-
gists (SSB). This is SSB's premier award, and is judged
by the quality and creativity of the research completed
over the course of the student's PhD program. The
award consists of $1000, a certicate of distinction, and
a two-year subscription to the journal Systematic Biol-
ogy.
Eligibility: Members of the Society who are advanced
PhD students or have completed their Ph.D. within the
last 15 months are eligible. Applicants may be from
any country, but MUST be members of SSB, and are
advised to join the Society as soon as possible to be con-
sidered (to join go to: http://systbio.org/?q=node/6).
Previous Mayr award winners are not eligible.
Application Procedure: 1. To be considered for this
award, you will need to submit a 400-word abstract of
your talk to the Evolution 2013 Snowbird meeting web-
site (http://www.evolutionmeeting.org/) at the time ofMarch 1, 2013 EvolDir 99
registration. Instructions for registering as a potential
Mayr award contender will be given on the meeting
website. 2. Abstracts should clearly indicate meth-
ods used, conclusions, and the relevance to systemat-
ics. Presentations focusing on other areas of biology
(ecology, behavior, genetics, populations or molecular
biology, etc.) that lack a strong systematics emphasis
are not eligible. 3. Applications for this award will be
accepted only until the end of early registration (April
19, 2012). 4. At the closing of early registration, a sub-
set of applicants will be selected by the SSB Awards
Committee to present their talks in the Mayr sympo-
sium during the meeting. All applicants will be notied
about selection decisions approximately May 15.
Judging: Based on submitted abstracts, the Mayr
Awards Committee (appointed by the Awards Chair,
Sean Brady) will select a maximum of 16 applicants for
inclusion in the Mayr Award symposium.
The Mayr symposium will be held at a single venue as
a continuous session. Talks will be judged on creativ-
ity, depth and excellence of research, and on quality of
presentation. Competitive students are expected to be
in the nal stages of their doctoral program, presenting
results of a major body of work.
Co-Authors: The talk may be co-authored. It is under-
stood that the ideas, data and conclusions presented
are primarily and substantially the work of the student
presenter, and the intention is that the student presen-
ter will be senior author on the published version of the
paper.
Notication of Winner: The winner of the award will
be announced at the SSB business meeting in Snow-
bird and again during the banquet awards ceremony
(complimentary ticket provided) at the conclusion of
the Evolution Meetings, whereupon the winner will be
given an award certicate. An announcement of the
winner will be published in Systematic Biology and
placed on the SSB website (see last year's winner at
http://systbiol.org/).

Software MetaPIGA v 3
METAPIGA v.3 IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD
(with Codon models, GPU computing, and more)102 EvolDir March 1, 2013
MetaPIGA is a versatile and easy-to-use software
that implements robust stochastic heuristics (including
the Metapopulation Genetic Algorithm, metaGA) for
large phylogeny inference under maximum likelihood.
MetaPIGA allows analyses of binary and molecular
data sets under multiple substitution models, Gamma
rate heterogeneity, and data partitioning. The software
is for all types of users as it can be run through an ex-
tensive and ergonomic graphical interface or by using
batch  and console interface on your local machine or
on distant servers. MetaPIGA is platform independent,
runs on 32- and 64-bits systems, and easily takes ad-
vantage of multiprocessor and/or multicore computers.
Here, we release the version 3 of MetaPIGA which,
besides bug xes, includes new functionalities such
as: - Maximum likelihood models for codon evolution
(Goldman-Yang 1994 and Empirical Models) with ac-
cess to multiple genetic codes (universal, mitochondria,
chloroplaste, etc); - Likelihood computation on CUDA-
compatible Nvidia graphic cards (reducing run time
by a factor of 10 to 20 for Protein/Codon data); -
Ancestral-state reconstruction using empirical Bayesian
inference.
Some of the other functionalities implemented in
MetaPIGA are: - Simple data quality control (test-
ing for the presence of identical sequences as well as
of excessively ambiguous or excessively-divergent se-
quences); - Automated trimming of poorly aligned re-
gions using the trimAl algorithm; - The Likelihood Ra-
tio Test, the Akaike Information Criterion, and the
Bayesian Information Criterion methods for easy selec-
tion of the substitution model that best ts your data;
- Detailed monitoring of run progress; - Convergence
statistics for automatically dening when an analysis is
complete; - Ancestral-state reconstruction of all nodes
in the tree; - Viewing and manipulation of result trees.
MetaPIGA v.3 and its manual can be downloaded
from the new website at www.metapiga.org. Don't
hesitate to contact us (Dorde.Grbic@unige.ch or
Michel.Milinkovitch@unige.ch) for additional ques-
tions, assistance, or bug reports.

SOUTH TEXAS SPEA BOMBIFRONS TISSUE
SOUGHT
I am an undergraduate student at Lehigh Univer-
sity working on an independent research project. I
am studying a disjunct population of Plains spadefoot
toads (Spea bombifrons) found in South Texas. I am
studying genetic divergence between this population
and populations from the remainder of the range. I
have access to tissue samples from many locations ex-
cept for this southern Texas region. Most museum sam-
ples I have found are in formalin, which makes DNA
work more dicult. I would appreciate hearing from
anyone who would be willing to share tissue samples of
S. bombifrons collected from any of the following coun-
ties: Aransas, Bee, Brooks, Cameron, Dimmit, Duval,

Structural Variations in Genomes: Ecological and Evo-

Call for papers in Frontiers in Genetics Re-

researchtopics/Structural Variations inGenom/1412
In this research topic we would like to bring together
articles that - describe bioinformatics and statistical
solutions for detecting, genotyping and analyzing
structural variations on a genome scale - focus on the
impact of structural variation on phenotypic variation,March 1, 2013 EvolDir 103
especially in the context of ecology and adaptation -
utilize comparative molecular and genomic approaches
to improve our understanding of structural varia-
tion formation, frequency and maintenance across
populations
The idea is to create an organized, comprehensive col-
lection of several contributions, as well as a forum for
discussion and debate. Contributions can be articles de-
scribing -original research -methods -hypothesis & the-
ory -opinions -reviews
Genome re-sequencing projects have revealed substan-
tial amounts of genetic variation between individu-
als extending beyond single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and short indels. Structural variants (SVs)
such as deletions, insertions, duplications, inversions
and translocations litter genomes and are often asso-
ciated with gene expression changes and severe pheno-
types (ie. genetic diseases in humans). Recent studies
on the functional aspects of dierent types of SVs have
unveiled several cases of adaptive evolution. For ex-
ample, inversions have been associated with ecological
adaptations and may facilitate speciation. Due to their
prevalent nature, SVs arguably have a large impact on
genome evolution and should not be neglected when
studying the genetics of adaptation and speciation.
SVs were classically dened as chromosomal rearrange-
ments larger than 1kb, but due to a higher resolution
of new detection methods, smaller variants (between 50
and 1000 base pairs) can now be accurately assessed.
Besides various methods of detection in next generation
sequencing data (paired end mapping, split reads, and
depth of coverage), array-based approaches have proven
to be particularly useful for detecting copy number vari-
ations (CNVs). These technologies have enabled re-
searchers to catalog a wide spectrum of SVs in many
organisms and infer the eects of selection shaping their
evolutionary trajectories.
To gain further insights into the ecological and evo-
lutionary implications of genomic SVs, we stress the
need for a more comprehensive account of SVs in a
wide range of organisms sampled in their natural habi-
tat. Collecting data on SVs across various species and
amongst populations with dierent divergence times
will further add to the data available on the evolution-
ary turnover rates of SVs. Achieving these goals would
greatly benet from further development of methods
for SV detection, particularly for next generation se-
quencing data (due to its applicability in non-model
organisms). An essential step will be to collect more
validation data to evaluate and improve methodologies.
The determination of exact breakpoints and genotypes,
which is currently challenging in diploid organisms, willallow the use of SV polymorphism data within a popu-
lation genetic framework. This will aid in disentangling
genetic drift and demographic eects from selection -
the evolutionary processes shaping the patterns of SV
diversity.

Trees DepositChronograms
We [1] have been working to create DateLife.org, a web
service for dating groups of organisms based on pub-
lished chronograms. It was partially inspired by the
excellent TimeTree.net service [2], but diers in impor-
tant ways: it can take more than two taxa, it uses un-
certainty in the source trees, it can stretch input trees,
and it is radically open: you're welcome to fork all the
code, download all the trees, scrape data from the web-
site or via the API, etc. It is still being actively tested
and developed, so I would not recommend using it for
publications yet, but it is available and should reach
beta form soon.104 EvolDir March 1, 2013
However, for it to work we need a set of chronograms.
We have scoured TreeBase and Dryad and gotten sev-
eral, but 1) we may have missed some and 2) most pub-
lished trees are actually not deposited anywhere. Any
trees we receive will be deposited in the PhyloOrchard
R package [3], to enable anyone to reuse them (and
ideally, they should also go in ocial repositories like
TreeBase or Dryad). We can take single chronograms
but also sets such as a set of bootstrap trees run through
r8s or a set of post-burnin trees from BEAST: DateLife
uses this uncertainty when getting age estimates.
If you have published chronograms we could use, please
email them, or a link to where they are available, to
bomeara@utk.edu . Please include information about
the proper citation (this goes in the PhyloOrchard
help les, is included in DateLife, and is added to our
DateLife Mendeley group). Also let us know if the
units for branch length on the chronograms are any-
thing other than one unit for one million years. The
most useful trees for this are ones where terminals are
species (rather than families, or dierent samples all
from one species), but all trees are welcome.

(*Myotis lucifugus*) and factors which may be im-
portant in managing the disease white nose syndrome
(WNS) currently wiping out colonies of hibernating
bats in the USA and Canada.
Field work will take place in Manitoba and Ontario in
multiple teams each led by an experienced local crew
leader. Team volunteers will assist with capture and
handling of individual bats as they emerge from hiber-
nacula (caves or mines) in the spring, outtting bats
with passive transponders (PIT tags) and deployment
of PIT-tag recording systems. This is an excellent op-
portunity to obtain training and gain experience in eld
research with bats, disease ecology and basic electron-
ics.
Food and accommodation in the eld will be provided
as will return travel to and from Winnipeg at the be-
ginning and end of eldwork. Accommodation will be
basic; either camping or in rustic cabins. Training will
be provided and no experience is necessary but candi-dates should have an interest in ecology, wildlife, eld
biology and animal behavior. A large amount of time
will be spent camping or in basic accommodation in all
weather conditions and, as such, successful applicants
need to love the outdoors, be up-beat, positive, respon-
sible and work well as part of a team.
In addition to work from April to May, there is the
possibility of renewal of some of these positions from
late July to late September depending on performance.

around the detection of disruptive selection across
ecological gradients and contrasts in tropical tree
populations, in the context of evolutionary/ecological
genomics and of the modelling of the response of tree
stands to expected global change. He/she will prepare
DNA samples for NGS genotyping and analyse the
data derived from such genotyping activities (which
will be outsourced), mostly focussing on modelling of
population genetic processes with a minor involvement
in bioinformatic data treatment. He/she will also be
involved in the setup of reciprocal transplants and in
the measurement of quantitative traits in the eld.

MaxPlanck Tuebingen HIV
Evolution
Post-doc positions at Max-Planck Tuebingen: HIV
Evolution/Theoretical Population Genetics
Post-doctoral positions are available in the Max-
Planck-Research group of Richard Neher in Tuebingen,
Germany. Our group works on theoretical population
genetics as well as HIV evolution. HIV is a very rapidly
evolving facultatively sexual virus and the within pa-
tient dynamics of viral populations cannot be modeled
with classical population genetics approaches. Instead,
one needs population genetics of rapid adaptation.
Our group combines empirical research, a collabora-
tion with Prof. Jan Albert at the Karolinska Institute
in Stockholm, Sweden, who is using deep sequencing
methods to obtain detailed snapshots of HIV popula-
tions at densely spaced time points, with theory. Dy-
namical data is a much richer source of evolutionary
information that static snapshots and we will use thisMarch 1, 2013 EvolDir 117
data to parameterize models of HIV evolution. In ad-
dition to sequence information, our modeling of HIV
evolution builds on structural information at the level
of RNA genome and the viral proteins as well as the in-
teraction of the viral population with the host immune
system. The empirical work on HIV is complemented
by theoretical work on the dynamics of rapidly evolving
population.
The projects are funded by Max-Planck-Society, an
ERC Starting Grant on HIV evolution, and a collabo-
rative grant on translation eciency in viruses together
with Tamir Tuller at Tel-Aviv university.
We are looking for highly motivated applicants with
a strong background in mathematics, as well as pro-
ciency in at least one programming and one script-
ing language (python, preferably). A PhD in a rel-
evant discipline (physics, math, biology, or computer
science/bioinformatics, etc) is required. Prior exposure
to population genetics and bioinformatics is desirable,
but absolutely not necessary.
The institute is located on the Max Planck Campus
in Tuebingen and oers an international environment,
with English as the working language. We are part
of a dynamic and interactive group of labs researching
various aspects of evolution. Tuebingen boasts one of
Germany's top universities and a vibrant cultural life
with easy connections to major European cities.
Applicants should send an application (statement of re-
search interest, CV, publication list, contact details of
three references, merged into a single PDF) directly to
richard.neher@tuebingen.mpg.de
Salary will be according to the public service employee

Duration of the contract: 12 mois / 12 months
Scientic description Great diet exibility and manipu-
lation abilities allow primates to be more resilient than
many other animals to uctuations in climate and food
availability. Primate food choice is complex and de-
pends on dierent factors such as the nutritional qual-
ity of the available food, and the nutritional needs and
health status of the individuals. Moreover, in great apes
cultural dierences seem to explain part of the feed-
ing variation, but this is still debated as many consider
culture to be a uniquely a human trait. Particularly,
feeding techniques, which vary across dierent popu-
lations of chimpanzees and orang-utans, have been de-
ned as cultural traits similarly to human societies who
live in the same environment and have the same tools
but show dierent cultural choices. Whether feeding
traditions and culture exist in all species of great apes
and how they are transmitted between generations is
still an open question. Little is known on the elusive
and endangered western gorillas. Yet, they appear to
rely on dierent learning mechanisms in relation to the
use of toxic plants in comparison to wild chimpanzees.
The proposed research will shed light on feeding tra-
ditions and functional capacities of western gorillas at
dierent levels: inter-species, inter-groups, inter and
intra-individuals. This research aims at investigating:
1) the existence of 'cultural' traditions in gorilla food
choice that are independent from food availability, 2) if
the intra and inter-specic dierences (in comparison to
existing data on other primates, including humans) in
food processing and manipulation techniques (includ-
ing manual preferences) are linked to feeding traditions
and/or morphological variability respectively, and 3)
the behavioural mechanisms involved in the transmis-
sion of feeding information (food choice and processing)
during learning. The candidate is expected to have pre-
vious eld experience (preferably with gorillas) and will
be working under natural conditions in West Africa.

Stockholm WormGenomics
Post-doctoral researcher
A postdoc position is available in the research group of
Ulf Jondelius at the Swedish Museum of Natural His-
tory, Stockholm.
We are looking for a highly motivated postdoc with
interest in animal evolution for a project using data
from genome sequencing of microscopic marine worms
(Acoelomorpha). Acoelomorpha are simple animals
lacking many features present in other Bilateria (e.g.
circulatory system, body cavity, excretory organs).
Their phylogenetic position is highly contested: they
have been proposed to be either the earliest extant bila-
terians, part of the atworms, or deuterostomes closely
related to echinoderms and hemichordates. The con-
icting hypotheses imply widely disparate interpreta-
tions of their morphological evolution as either primi-
tively simple or secondarily reduced in complexity. We122 EvolDir March 1, 2013
will sample genomic data to cover acoelomorph diver-
sity aiming to reconstruct their phylogenetic position
within the Metazoa and study the structure of the
genomes expecting to nd either a simple basal meta-
zoan genome or higher bilaterian and deuterostome sig-
natures. The succesful candidate will work on assem-
bly and analysis of genomes from several acoelomorph
species together with the PI, collaborators, students,
and technicians and will be responsible for analyzing
results, writing manuscripts, and contributing to the
development of the project.
The project is a collaboration with SciLife lab in Stock-
holm and Uppsala and colleagues at the Sars Centre in

AvianPopulationModelling
Modelling large-scale population processes in Swiss
breeding birds
The Swiss Ornithological Institute in Sempach
(Switzerland) is seeking a highly motivated post-
doctoral researcher to model large-scale population pro-
cesses in Swiss breeding birds. The project aims 1) todevelop methods that allow the estimation of survival
and recruitment from monitoring data and 2) to model
spatial and temporal variation of survival and recruit-
ment in selected species to better understand popula-
tion trends.
The main data source in the project will be the Swiss
breeding bird survey (MHB), which has been producing
2-3 replicated counts per breeding season in 267 1 km2
quadrats in every breeding season since 1999. These
data allow estimation of population trends in abun-
dance while accommodating imperfect detection. How-
ever, the demographic mechanisms underlying these
trends remain unknown. The model of Dail and Mad-
sen (Biometrics 2011) enables the estimation of survival
and recruitment from such data. Exploring the poten-
tial of the Dail-Madsen-model at the scale of Switzer-
land will be a rst part of the project. A possible topic
is also to develop extensions of the model, such as the
inclusion of correlated spatial eects or the integration
of MHB data with other data sets that are directly
informative about demographic rates, such as ring-
recoveries. A second part of the project is the appli-
cation of the modelling framework to address relevant
ecological and management questions. Candidates in-
clude the patterns of survival and recruitment along the
altitudinal gradient in Switzerland or whether particu-
lar habitat types or regions are associated with higher
survival or recruitment. It will be one of the duties
of the selected candidate to identify relevant research
topics in this eld and then to expand on the identied
issues using our data and the modelling framework to
be developed.
The ideal candidate has solid experience in population
modelling, in Bayesian statistical modelling and is a
procient programmer in the R and BUGS languages.
Further, a demonstrated ability and willingness to pro-
duce high-quality publications will be an important se-
lection criterion.
The work will be conducted in collaboration with
Michael Schaub (michael.schaub@vogelwarte.ch) and
Marc K ery (marc.kery@vogelwarte.ch), which both are
available for further information.
The position is initially for two years, but may be ex-
tended to a third year. The ideal starting date would be
June 2013. Information on the Institute can be found
at www.vogelwarte.ch/startseite-english.html Applica-
tions (preferably by e-mail) should be submitted to
Michael Schaub (michael.schaub@vogelwarte.ch), Swiss

UArizona ProteinBioinformatics
A postdoc position is available to work with Joanna
Masel (http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at
the University of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist
destination surrounded on all four sides by mountain-
ous national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city
of nearly a million people with an attractive climate.
The Masel group's main research interests are in ro-bustness and evolvability, using a mixture of analyt-
ical theory, bioinformatic and simulation approaches.
We are looking for someone to do primarily bioinfor-
matic work, but opportunities for related, more theo-
retical projects and/or experimental collaborations also
exist. The EEB department in Tucson was ranked
in the top 10 by US News & World Report, and has
many other research groups doing evolutionary biology
and/or bioinformatics, e.g. those of Mike Sanderson,
Ryan Gutenkunst, and Mike Barker, providing a rich
intellectual environment.
We are looking for someone to investigate the origin of
novelty at the protein-sequence level. The conventional
view is that new proteins evolve from old proteins via
gene duplication and divergence. However, this poses
a chicken-and-egg problem, implying an ancient \big
bang" of protein creation. This project focuses instead
on the ongoing de novo evolution of protein-coding
genes from previously non-coding sequences. The post-
doc will investigate both case studies of this phenom-
ena, and computational predictors of biochemical prop-
erties that might facilitate such conversions over evolu-
tionary timescales. Such predictors will be used to test
concrete hypotheses that have arisen from theories of
evolvability.
Excellent computer programming skills are strongly
preferred, ideally with bioinformatics / genomics ex-
perience. Strong candidates who come from a more
experimental background within evolutionary biology
and who now wish to retrain as bioinformaticians will
also be considered. Experience with (or at least prior
interest in) evolutionary biology, protein structure and
folding, statistics and other quantitative approaches are
all advantages. A start date of August 2013 is pre-
ferred but negotiable, and the position is renewable,
with funding secured for three years.

Closing date 19th March 2013
Further particulars:
We wish to recruit a Research Fellow to participate
in a collaborative project between microbiologists and
mathematicians to better understand the evolution of
antibiotic resistance and, guided appropriately by novel
theory, to seek methods for controlling it. This EPSRC-
funded post is available immediately for a xed term of24 months. The successful applicant will work predomi-
nantly in the lab of an inter-disciplinary team of math-
ematical modellers, bioinformaticians and microbiolo-
gists producing bespoke evolutionary datasets to deter-
mine how bacteria like E. coli and S. aureus (MRSA)
respond to dierent combinations of antibiotics for pro-
longed treatments. We are particularly interested in
the dierences between in vitro and in vivo measures
of antibiotic ecacy and why, for but one example, the
interaction between vancomycin and rifampin in MRSA
is so dicult to determine in the lab. However, the pre-
cise nature of the nal project will also depend on the
key skills and interests of the successful applicant.
The Research Fellow will be required to design and im-
plement microbiological evolution experiments and our
preference is for applicants with a background either in
molecular microbiology or else a quantitative scientist
with experience in an experimental wet lab, for exam-
ple this may be a physicist with interests appropriate to
the post. It will be advantageous to work well with col-
leagues from dierent disciplines, but it will be essential
to present work at national and international confer-
ences and to write scientic papers both independently
and as part of a team.

Drosophila Evolutionary Genomics
We hypothesize that network components and basic
structure will be more conserved than individual poly-
morphisms and more likely to predict phenotypes across
species and conditions. We propose to test this hy-
pothesis by identifying both individual polymorphisms
and networks and determining the predictive value of
each. We will use RNA-seq to measure expression and
high throughput phenotyping to measure complex be-
haviors in Drosophila and the eects of ethanol expo-
sure as a model for species dierences in and environ-
mental eects on genotype to phenotype maps. This
project involves two large association panels in two
species (melanogaster and simulans). Data collection is
primarily conducted by our collaborator and this posi-
tion is primarily for the modeling of the resulting data.
However, laboratory and phenotypic collection oppor-
tunities are easily available if the applicant is interested.

ness to be an integral part of a vibrant team. Our128 EvolDir March 1, 2013
group works highly interactively and co-operation and
collaboration are a key component to our success. This
position could be lled by a theoretical/modeling scien-
tist who is excited about interactions with empiricists
or a scientist with an empirical background who wishes
to strengthen their analytical skills. Good writing skills
are required. This position is initially for one year and
renewable based upon mutual agreement. Salary will be

*Summary of the Project*
Although living in groups has many advantages, it also
involves certain disadvantages such as increased disease
transmission and the need to make collective decisions.
In theory, the social network properties optimizing de-
cision accuracy and the spreading of information should
also increase the disease transmission rate, creating a
trade-o between decision-making eciency and infec-
tion risk. We aim to explore this trade-o by exam-
ining social network properties and investigating how
they might interact to maximize decision accuracy and
minimize infection risk. We propose an evaluation of
this trade-o in non-human primates using both exper-
imental and theoretical approaches.
The project is innovative and multidisciplinary because
it compares information versus disease transmission
and combines observation and experimentation with
modelling. Our approach is designed to highlight mech-
anisms underlying decision accuracy and disease trans-
mission, with social networks reecting a trade-o be-

the costs and benets of social networks for a specic

UUppsala Bioinformatics
Uppsala University hereby declares the following posi-
tion to be open for application:
Postdoctoral Researcher in Bioinformatics (*UFV-PA
*2013/366*)*
at the Animal Ecology Program, the Department of
Ecology and Genetics, Evolutionary Biology Centre
(EBC) with starting date being April 1 ^st , 2013, or
as soon as possible after this date. The EBC hosts
one of the world's largest aggregations of evolution-
ary biologists, and is a prime research environment
for a wide range of elds in evolutionary biology and
genetics (see \http://www.ebc.uu.se/" for more infor-
mation). We also form an integrated part, together
with other centers within Uppsala University as well
as with those at three other universities, of SciLife-
Lab. SciLifeLab is a very large center for large-scale
biosciences, combining advanced technical know-how
and state-of-the-art equipment with a broad knowledge
in translational biology, medicine and molecular bio-
science. Integrated platforms in genomics, comparative
genetics, proteomics, bioinformatics, functional biology,
bioimaging and functional genomics are employed in
various scientic domains. Bioinformatic work is per-
formed primarily through the UPPMAX / UPPNEX
computing facility.
Our working atmosphere is very international with En-
glish as our operational language. Uppsala University
is the oldest university in Scandinavia and the city of
Uppsala is a vibrant student town with beautiful sur-
roundings conveniently situated 40 minutes with train
from Stockholm.
*Brief research outline: **The holder of this position
will assist and direct a project aiming towards the de
novo assembly of a beetle (Coleoptera) which is a major
model organism. The project represents a challengingde novo eort in its true sense: despite the fact that
about 25% of all described metazoan species are beetles,
the genome of only a single beetle species has yet been
described. Thus, the availability of reference genomes
is limited. Large amounts of NGS data is already at
hand. The holder of this position will lead and perform
the bioinformatic work towards assembly, quality as-
sessment and annotation of the genome. The holder will
be expected to be able to work independently, but will
be an integrated part of both an in-house interactive
research group working empirically with this model sys-
tem (about 10 people), a larger bioinformatic network
at the EBC and in Uppsala (*SciLifeLab*UPPNEX
/ WABI*) and with international collaborators.**The
position is funded by the European Research Council
and the Swedish Research Council. **
*Salary and appointment*: The period of appointment
is two years. Uppsala University adopts an individual
salary policy but the starting salary for postdoctoral
researchers is typically about 31.000 SEK per month
and includes full social benets.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate must have a
Ph.D, or an exam which is judged comparable to a PhD,
that was completed within three years of the start of
the employment. Applicants that received their PhD
earlier than this date will be considered only if special
circumstances exist (such as prolonged periods of ill-
ness, parental leave, military service, union duties and
others of similar character).
*Qualications and merits*: The ideal candidate has a
documented expertise in bioinformatic research, using
bioinformatic tools and software. Previous experience
of /de novo/ genome assembly is highly desirable, as is
experience of working with dierent types of genomic
data (e.g., Illumina, SOLiD).**
*To apply:*Candidates should submit a short cover let-
ter, a curriculum vitae including a list of publications
and a short (1-2 pages) description of their experience,
past research accomplishments and future research am-
bitions. Applicants should also include names and e-
mail addresses of two referees and should specify the
date they will be available to start the position.

Post-doc: Understanding the contribution of epistasis
to phenotypic robustness
The Computational Genetics section at the Department
of Clinical Sciences, SLU, Uppsala, Sweden focus on
deepening our understanding of the genetic mechanisms
involved in adaption. By developing new genetic mod-
els, statistical methods, computational algorithms and
bioinformatics tools, and applying these to a wide range
of biological datasets from model-organisms, plants and
animals to humans, we seek to provide novel insights to
the contribution of genetics in general and genetic in-
teractions (epistasis) in particular to phenotypic change
over time.
This Post-doc project is part of an ongoing eort to
understand the genetic regulation of between-genotype
variance heterogeneity. This type of genetic regula-
tion has recently become a hot topic in genetics and
is this far relatively unexplored. It has a central role
in phenotypic robustness and could be due to a multi-
tude of underlying factors including epistasis and gene-by-environment interactions. We are currently in the
process of developing a number of statistical and com-
putational methods and tools to explore the extent of
genetic variance-heterogeneity in experimental datasets
from model-organisms, plants, animals and humans.
The post-doctoral researcher joining this project will,
depending on the background, competence and interest,
be involved in either i) the implementation and/or test-
ing of newly developed methods in simulated and exper-
imental datasets, ii) use the already available methods
to explore the extent of genetic variance-control in ex-
perimental data and the potential contribution of epis-
tasis to the detected signals, iii) explore the potential
contribution of genetic variance-control and epistasis to
phenotypic robustness in experimental data, or a com-
bination of all three topics.
As the project is highly interdisciplinary, researchers
with dierent backgrounds both within and across tra-
ditional scientic disciplines work closely together on a
daily basis. We therefore have no formal requirement
on your background, but to be considered for the post,
we do expect that you have a sincere interest in the
topic, a relevant scientic education (Ph.D. degree or
similar) and an interest in Quantitative-, Population-
and Evolutionary Genetics. A strong mathematical /
statistical background and programming experience is
an advantage.
To learn more about us, you could visit http://-
www.computationalgenetics.se or contact Orjan Carl-
borg (orjan.carlborg@slu.se). If you are interested in
being considered for the post, please send us a short
description of how you feel that you can contribute to
this interdisciplinary work together with a CV and a
list of your previous publications. We look forward to
hear from you!
Salary and conditions of future employment(s) are un-
der the terms of the current agreement for academic
scientists employed in the public sector. The position
is initially for one year, with a potential extension for a
second year. It will remain open until a suitable candi-

UppsalaU EvolutionMulticellularity
* Postdoc position '**Multilevel selection in lamen-
tous fungi: a clue to the evolution of multicellularity**'
at Uppsala University, Sweden*
A fully-funded 1-year postdoctoral research position
(with the high probability for a second year) is cur-
rently available at the Department of Evolutionary Bi-
ology, Uppsala University, Sweden.
The theory of evolution by natural selection is one of
the cornerstones in modern biology. There is, however,
considerable debate about which entities (ranging from
genes, cells and individuals, to populations, species and
species groups) are the units of selection. Natural se-
lection acting at dierent levels is expected to drive the
aggregation of smaller independent units to form new,
more complex, layers of biological organization. Forexample, this process is expected to have driven the
evolution of multicellularity, whereby the interaction
between genes and cells resulted in a tness increase
in multicellular organisms compared to unicellular or-
ganisms. This post-doc project involves the study of
multilevel selection in lamentous ascomycetes. These
organisms may be considered intermediates between
unicellular and multicellular organisms because of their
totipotent and free ranging heterogeneous nuclei within
a mycelium, all of which contributes to the phenotype
of the mycelium. The candidate will perform arti-
cial selection experiments combined with genomics and
transcriptomics of the model system /Neurospora /to
investigate whether the mycelium represents a case of
cooperation or conict between the haploid nuclei it
contains. Under the scenario of cooperation we expect
to observe inter-nucleus dynamics that are typical of
those observed within diploid nuclei, such as sheltering
of /de novo/ deleterious mutations and dosage compen-
sation, and the combination of adaptive mutations of
the heterogeneous nuclei should be benecial for the
mycelium. A next step is to test for kin selection by
investigating the outcome of interactions between nu-
clei exhibiting dierent degrees of relatedness. On the
other hand, under the conict scenario, heterogeneous
mycelia would be at a tness disadvantage due to an-
tagonism among nuclei. The results of the evolutionary
interactions occurring at subcellular and higher levels
emerging from this project have the potential to con-
tribute signicantly to our understanding of one of the
major evolutionary transitions - the evolution of multi-
cellularity.
Applicants should have a PhD in biology/ecology and
a strong interest in biology and evolution. Experi-
ence in experimental lab skills as well as some knowl-
edge in bioinformatics are advantageous. Mathemati-
cal skills and an interest to develop theoretical mod-
els are welcome but entirely optional. The candi-
date will join the research group of Simone Imm-
ler (see http://www.ebc.uu.se/forskning/IEG/evbiol/-

search focus of the Immler lab lies on the evolu-
tionary consequences of sex, in particular the evo-
lution of gametes and the consequences of dier-
ential selection between the haploid and diploid
phases of the eukaryotic life cycle using experi-
mental and mathematical tools. This project will
be in close collaboration with the group of Hanna
Johannesson, (http://www.ebc.uu.se/forskning/IEG/-

Ban EvoSysBio May26-31
Hi all,
On May 26-31 2013 we are organizing a 5 day workshop
at the beautiful Ban International Research Center.
We intend to discuss a broad range of mathematical
challenges and tools that are important in evolution-
ary systems biology. The latter we take to include
work that builds bridges between the molecular sys-
tems biology and evolutionary biology. More pointedly
it could also be dened as the eort to get a better
understanding and overview of tness landscapes by in-
cluding more molecular information. We think that the
modeling in systems biology could provide great oppor-
tunities for addressing a number of old key questions
that are important for evolutionary biology and pop-
ulation genetics, including distributions of mutational
eects, epistasis and many more.
We aim to bring together researchers interested in
quantitative methods at the interface between evolu-
tion and systems biology.
Participation at this workshop is by invitation only and
we already have an interesting lineup of speakers. More
information can be found at:

Crete Metabarcoding May13-17
2ND DNA METABARCODING SPRING SCHOOL IN
CRETE, GREECE (13-17 MAY 2013)
The advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have revolutionized many elds of the bi-
ological sciences, including that of biodiversity studies.
Many ecological questions rely on the knowledge of the
list of species involved in the studied process. Tack-
ling this demand using standard methods of taxonom-
ical identication, is often a dicult task that relies
on highly qualied persons. DNA barcoding has intro-
duced the use of short standardized genomic sequences
(barcode) as a character in taxonomical identication.
DNA metabarcoding uses the same principle that asso-
ciates DNA sequences to taxa for estimating biodiver-
sity of an environmental sample. Metabarcoding ap-
proaches use total and usually degraded DNA from en-
vironmental samples to analyze biotic assemblages and
can be potentially carried out for any kind of organ-
isms in an ecosystem. These analyses rely on specic
genetic markers, called metabarcodes, which should be
optimized for taxonomic resoluti on, minimal bias in
amplication of the target organism group and shortsequence length. As all living organisms spread cells in
their environment, a PCR amplicon obtained with ad-
equate primers from the total DNA extracted from an
environmental sample, can be consider as a mirror of
the biodiversity present in the environment. The perti-
nent choice of the primer pair allows to focus on a spe-
cic group as, for example, plants. Then the sequencing
of a large number of individual DNA molecules of the
PCR amplicon using NGS technologies allows establish-
ing a list of taxa present in the sample. Metabarcoding
can be applied to many ecological studies such as plant
community analysis, plankton and benthic community
analysis, past ecosystem reconstruction, or diet assess-
ment.
After the success of the 1st DNA Metabarcoding Spring
School in French Alps, we organize the 2nd one in Crete,
which includes lectures and bioinformatic practical ses-
sions on metabarcoding. The School is open for 20 par-
ticipants (post-graduate students or researchers) that
will attend both lectures and practicals, and for 30 ad-
ditional participants that will follow only the lectures.
The focus will be mainly on marine biodiversity, how-

aged to participate.

Plant Morphology: Linking Phenotype to Develop-
ment, June 10 - 21, 2013
With the opportunity to bring molecular genetic and
genomic tools to almost any clade of plants, a key
challenge will be to link comparative developmental
genetics to existing bodies of knowledge; notably the
two hundred year legacy of comparative developmental
morphology. This integration is critical as the phyloge-
netic, structural, and ecological breadth of plant taxa
open to study expands, and the sophistication of poten-
tial questions increases in complexity. This course will
provide vital analytical tools central to understanding
the developmental bases for structural and functional
diversity. Summer courses in organismic plant biology
at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University bring
world-class faculty and a world-class living collection
together to enable students from around the world to
know the phenotype.
In 2013, \Plant Morphology: Linking Phenotype to
Development," an intensive two-week laboratory and
lecture course for advanced undergraduates, graduate
students, and postdoctoral fellows will cover the fun-
damental principles of plant form, focusing on devel-
opmental dynamics, evolutionary diversication, and
ecological and physiological function. Students will be
presented with the conceptual and analytical tools nec-
essary to interpret the vast array of morphologies that
exist among plants. Professors Pamela Diggle (Uni-
versity of Colorado) and Peter Endress (University of
Zurich) will serve as the instructors. This course is lim-
ited to 12 students.

be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand. With a focus on
family data, we will discuss fundamental issues needed
to increase success in gene mapping studies including:
optimal study design, power to detect linkage and as-
sociation, determining the most appropriate statistical
methods and software, interpretation of statistical re-
sults and trouble shooting. We will also cover the ba-
sic principles of statistical inference, hypothesis testing,
population and quantitative genetics and Mendelian in-
heritance. Our interactive and intensive educational
program will enable one to better carry out sophisti-
cated statistical analyses of genetic data, and will also
improve one's interpretation and understanding of the
results. All the software used is freely available, so that
skills learned can be easily applied after the course.
Teaching will take the form of lectures by invited speak-
ers, informal tutorials, hands-on computer sessions, and
analysis of disease family data sets. There will also be
an opportunity to discuss participants' own data sets.

ANNOUNCING: Summer 2013 REU Opportunities in
The Ecology and Evolution of Changing Environments
at Kansas State University
Kansas State University invites applicants for a 10-week
REU Summer Program. The focus of the program is on
the mechanistic understanding of ecological and evolu-
tionary responses to short- and long-term responses to
changing environments. Research projects will address
biological patterns observed in changing environments
by examining underlying genetic, developmental, phys-
iological, or ecological mechanisms.
The program is hosted by the Ecological Genomics In-
stitute, The Konza Prairie Biological Station, and the
Division of Biology at K-State. Over 30 faculty from
the Division of Biology and Departments of Entomol-
ogy, Geography, and Plant Pathology, will serve as po-
tential mentors. Participants will learn modern ap-
proaches in ecology and evolutionary biology, attend

NSF-IOS Early Stage Faculty Writing Retreat
Mountain Lake Biological Station Pembroke, VA
August 5-9, 2013
We invite applications from early-stage faculty from
groups under-represented in Biology for an intensive
writing retreat paired with a publication workshop Au-
gust 5-9, 2013 at Mountain Lake Biological Station in
Pembroke, Virginia.
Funded by a grant from the National Science Founda-
tion IOS, the goal of the workshop is to support early-
stage biologists from groups under-represented in bi-
ology to develop into consistent, creative, productive
writers within their disciplines. Mentors with exten-
sive expertise as editors and editors-in chief, depart-
ment chairs, and senior scientists with highly success-March 1, 2013 EvolDir 149
ful publication records to will help participants de-
velop strategies for productive publication. The group
workshops will include topics such as: developing a
scholarship/writing plan; time management and de-
veloping eective writing habits; knowing when you
have enough data to make a paper complete; choos-
ing the right journal and writing eective cover letters
for manuscripts; communicating eectively with editors
and reviewers; developing productive writing collabo-
rations; and working with student coauthors. We also
hope to foster community ties among participants that
will continue to facilitate eective scholarship and oer
the concentrated opportunity to engage in productive
writing.
Intended Participants: Post-docs and early-stage fac-
ulty from groups under-represented in biology. Priority
will be given to participants 2-8 years out from their
PhD. We dene \under-represented" very broadly and
plan to be very inclusive as we gather a group of par-
ticipants who are diverse in many ways, including dis-
cipline of biology and type of institution.
Cost: Our NSF funding covers room, board and par-
ticipation costs for approximately 30 early-stage biolo-
gists from under-represented groups. Participants are
responsible for their own travel costs.

Okinawa BigData IntegrativeBiology
Ongoing technological advances are enabling new and
increasingly precise measurements of biological sys-
tems, from single molecules to entire ecosystems. For
example, sequencing a human genome, once a decade-
long, multi-billion dollar enterprise, will soon be as
routine as an x-ray for medical diagnosis. Likewise,
information on human behavioral patterns, previously
only accessible through laborious surveys, can now
be collected massively in real time using the internet
or mobile devices. However, the onslaught of high-
throughput, quantitative experiments has raised impor-
tant new questions. Can \big data" provide new in-
sights into old problems? What questions are uniquelysuited to large, data-driven approaches? What ideas
can dierent elds oer each other in terms of both
measurement and analysis? To address such topics, The
Okinawa Integrative Biology Course will bring together
a diverse range of scientists, from ecologists and evolu-
tionary biologists to physicists and mathematicians for
a two-week program in a stunning natural environment.
We are looking for motivated and energetic students,
whose participation in the course will be fully supported
(ight, housing, food, etc.). There is no reason not to
apply.
For more information, see our web site: oibc.oist.jp, or

(University of Lausanne)
Target participants: PhD students, advanced Master
students
This workshop, based on a concept developed by
Stephen Stearns and John Maynard Smith.
The main goals of this course are to develop the follow-
ing skills: . developing your scientic ideas through dis-
cussions in groups; . thinking critically and expressingMarch 1, 2013 EvolDir 151
oneself clearly; . turning a general idea into a research
project; . writing a research proposal and defending it.
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back seat.
Additionally, the faculty will give talks about their re-
search and be available for informal discussion with in-
dividual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in Villa Cassel (http://-
www.pronatura-aletsch.ch/home-en), at 2000 m of alti-
tude, amid the magnicent mountain landscape of UN-
ESCO World Heritage Site, walking distance from the
largest glacier of the Alps. This isolated site will help
you to concentrate on the course while giving you also
the chance to enjoy the views and the alpine ora.
Costs: CHF 530.- for room and board; there is no tu-
ition fee.
To apply, send a single le (pdf or rtf) con-
taining a short motivation letter, a cv, and the
name of your scientic advisor to Nadia Bruyndon-

FroSpects workshop \Genetics and Genomics of Speci-
ation"
Switzerland, March 26-29 2013
We invite a small number of early-career researchers(PhD students and Postdocs) to participate in a work-
shop on the \Genetics and Genomics of Speciation."
This is one of the nal events in the European Sci-
ence Foundation funded FroSpects program (http://-
webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/EEP/FroSpects/). It
will bring together a small number of senior speciation
researchers with ~15 early career speciation researchers
for a highly interactive three days of discussion, synthe-
sis, and writing focused on identifying current questions
in speciation research and how genomic data can help
address these questions.
Major themes of the workshop will include: 1. Genes
with major eect on speciation, isolation genes, and
\magic traits" 2. Genome-wide analyses of divergence
during speciation 3. Genetic constraints to speciation,
including the roles of standing genetic variation and G-
matrix properties
The goal of our workshop is to identify elements re-
quired, available and those still lacking for an extended
synthesis in speciation research integrating genomic
perspectives.
The workshop venue is the Center for Ecology,
Evolution and Biogeochemistry (CEEB) of Eawag,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology (http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/cc/-
ceeb/index EN). Participants will be accommodated on
site and will share all meals. We anticipate three days
of very intensive interactions.
Prospective junior participants (Postdocs and PhD stu-
dents) should send a one-paragraph statement of moti-
vation, along with a brief CV including a list of publica-
tions and a proposed poster title and abstract to work-
shop2013@eawag.ch. Applications will be accepted un-
til February 15th. Later applications will be considered
if places are available. All lodging and accommoda-
tion expenses will be covered from Tuesday night to
Saturday morning. Expenses for participants will in-
clude a 100 Swiss Franc ( ~100 USD) registration fee to
cover administrative expenses, and travel expenses to
Kastanienbaum (close to Lucerne, Switzerland). Ac-

Course on Programming for Evolutionary Biology
The deadline for applications is approaching: February
17th 2013!
Location: Leipzig, Germany
When: April 3rd - 19th 2013
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ 'Nothing
in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolu-
tion' (Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolutionary biology
often involves the analysis of an unprecedented amount
of information and supports many other disciplines,
such as medicine (evolutionary medicine), behavioral
biology (evolutionary psychology), ecology, and in-
formation transfer. Scientists have to analyze large
datasets, which requires computational programming
skills to design and apply own ideas into customized
algorithms.
In this intensive 17 days course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on expe-
rience in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the eld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a fo-
cus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
'learning by doing', which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as nal projects in smallgroups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs
of evolutionary biology or related research elds with
no or little programming experience who want to be-
come procient in computational evolutionary biology
in a couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the University of Leipzig.

Molecular Biology of Aging Summer Course to be held
July 21 - August 10, 2013 at the Marine Biological Lab-
oratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. This three-week
lecture and laboratory course features the newest and
most exciting ideas in aging research. The course is un-
der the new directorship of Matt Kaeberlein and Daniel
Promislow. While the focus will be primarily on themolecular biology of aging, both lecture and lab will
include essential evolutionary, statistical demography
and systems biology aspects of aging research.
Costs of attending the course, including travel, hous-
ing, and meals at the Marine Biology Lab in Woods
Hole, are fully covered by The Ellison Medical Founda-
tion. A distinguished faculty will interact with approx-
imately 20 students via lecture, discussion, hands-on
experiments, and analysis of data.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category156 EvolDir March 1, 2013
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
