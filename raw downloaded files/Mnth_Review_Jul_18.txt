Dear all,
On behalf of the Genetics Society of the UK we are
pleased to extend a very warm invitation to the 2018
autumn meeting - Genotype to Phenotype to Fitness.
The meeting will be held on 22-23 November 2018 at
Reed Hall, Exeter University, UK.
Registration and abstract submission is now OPEN
at https://my.genetics.org.uk/item.php?eventid=1014
The meeting will bring together researchers working
with diverse genetic techniques across a multitude of
systems, but who are nonetheless connected by a shared
passion for understanding adaptive evolution. The meet-
ing will have four themed open sessions over the two
days, each session featuring 2-3 of our invited speakersJuly 1, 2018 EvolDir 3
together with contributed talks and posters selected
from abstracts submitted. The four themed sessions
are titled Genotype to Phenotype, Constraint and Con-
ict, Genes in Environments and Micro to Macro. We
encourage everyone to interpret these themes broadly
- they are intended to help identify common ground
for discussion, not to limit scientic scope! In addi-
tion to the open sessions there will be an Early Career
Researcher symposium oering opportunities for early
career researchers to present in an especially supportive
environment.
Conrmed Speakers: Matthew Webster (Uppsala), Nina
Wedell (Exeter), Patrik Nosil (Sheeld), Susan John-
ston (Edinburgh), Edze Westra (Exeter), Chris Jiggins
(Cambridge), Anne Charmantier (Montpellier), Miltos
Tsiantis (Max Planck, Cologne), Katrina McGuigan
(Queensland), Walter Salzburger (Basel)

Oslo EcolEvolutionGenomics Aug30
Dear Colleagues,
The Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis
(CEES) at the Department of Biosciences, University of
Oslo, is pleased to announce the 2018 Oslo Symposium
on Ecology, Evolution and Genomics.
Symposium website: http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/-
english/research/news/events/research/others/2018/-
oslo-symposium-on-ecology-evolution-and-genomics/
The co-organisers are CEES Chair Nils Chr. Stenseth
and CEES Researcher Jerey Hutchings (Dalhousie
University, Canada).
Symposium Theme: Bridging the Fundamentals of Ecol-
ogy, Evolution, and Genomics: Challenges and Solu-
tions.
Location and Details: 30 August 2018 (9:00 am - 5:00
pm) at the Gamle festsal, Domus Academica, Karl Jo-
hans gate 47 in central Oslo. This year's Oslo Sympo-
sium on Ecology, Evolution and Genomics will feature
six invited plenary talks followed by a poster session
for postgraduate students (MSc, PhD), postdoctoral
researchers, and interested attendees.
Keynote speaker: Spencer Barrett (University of
Toronto, Toronto, CANADA).
Plenary speakers: Per Ahlberg (Uppsala University, Up-
psala, SWEDEN), Kirsten Bomblies (John Innes Centre,
Norwich, UK), Felicity Jones (Friedrich Miescher Labo-
ratory, Max Plank Institute, T ubingen, GERMANY),
Judith Mank (University College London, UK; Univer-
sity of British Columbia, CANADA), Rebekah Oomen
(Dalhousie University, Halifax, CANADA; CEES, Uni-
versity of Oslo, NORWAY).
Format and objectives: The plenaries will allow time for
contemplative, but provocative, presentations and dis-
cussions. In preparing their talks, the invited speakers
have been asked to think broadly about fundamental
questions in ecology and evolution for which genomics
has played an integral role. Speakers also have been
asked to look ahead to identify questions that might
soon be answerable, to identify challenges that might
aect such research progress, and to oer solutions and
ideas as to how the scientic community might best
proceed. The plenary talks will be followed by a poster
session by interested graduate students, postdocs, andestablished researchers.
Registration: There is no registration fee for attending
the Oslo Symposium. However, because of seating-
capacity restrictions, attendees do need to register
their names and aliations. Link to registration

Looking forward to meeting you at the conference,
The organisers - Marisa, Marina and Jarek
We are pleased to announce the fourth Programming
for Evolutionary Biology Conference, which will take
place in Buttermere, Lake District, UK, on September
2-6 (Sunday to Thursday). The conference is organised
by postgraduate students and sta at the Department
of Biological and Geographical Sciences, University of
Hudderseld, UK.
Details are available at http://pebconference.info/.
The Programming for Evolutionary Biology conference
brings together scientists broadly interested in apply-
ing bioinformatic tools to answer evolutionary and eco-
logical questions. Unlike other conferences featuring
mostly talks and poster sessions, PEB aims to serve as
a platform for discussing common programming pitfalls
encountered during research and features workshops to
further develop participants' bioinformatic skills. The
conference is small ( <50 participants), has an informal
atmosphere and is predominantly aimed at postgraduate
students and early-career researchers.For the duration of the conference, we are taking over the
entire youth hostel in Buttermere, Lake District, Cum-
bria https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/buttermere), a rel-
atively remote village in one of the most beautiful val-
leys in the District (https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/-
buttermere-valley). We will be providing transport to
and from Buttermere for the participants.
The programme includes up to 18 short (15 min) talks
and presentations before lunch and up to 6 computa-
tional workshops and tutorials in the afternoon. We will
have pleasure of welcoming two fantastic keynote speak-

A PhD studentship is available to start from October
2018 on the genome and domestication of Hermetia illu-
cens, commonly known as the black soldier y (BSF),
funded by the UK National Productivity Investment
Fundthrough the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council.
By feeding on organic waste biomass, such as food, agri-
cultural and manure wastes, BSF larvae are capable
of converting waste biomass into a sustainable and re-
newable source of sought-after nutrients 'V BSF larvae
are rich in lipids and proteins, and BSF larvae-derived
meals are eective feedstus for a range of commonly
farmed livestock species ranging from poultry to farmed
sh. This project will study the genome of the BSF and
apply population genetic and machine learning meth-
ods for analysis of the signatures of domestication in
industrial strains.
We have already obtained a preliminary assembly of the
BSF genome using a single Chromium 10X library with
a total length of 1.1Gb and scaold N50 of 1.05Mb. The
sequenced individual was from a trio family for which
further siblings are available. We have also established a
stock derived entirely from the original founder pair that
can be used for future genetic analysis. The studentship
will improve the genome assembly, using long-read se-
quence for a single additional sibling individual and for
the parents. This will permit a trio-based assembly
approach whereby ospring reads are separated into
haplotypes before assembly using parental kmers, from
which we anticipate obtaining multi-megabase scale as-
semblies for both parental haplotypes. The genome
will be annotated using publicly available transcriptome
data, using the BRAKER pipeline, which we have used
recently for annotation of buttery genomes. An ex-
tensive RNAseq data set has already been published in
which larvae were exposed to a variety of diets, providinga resource for annotation of larva-expressed genes.
To study the process of domestication we will obtain Illu-
mina WGS resequencing data for a population sample of
the industrial strain of BSF, and for least one outgroup
population/species. The student will map these data
to the reference genome, call genotypes and use both
composite likelihood and machine learning approaches
in order to scan the genome for regions that have been
subject to recent selection. Genome regions that have
been under adaptive selection during the process of do-
mestication will be potential targets for future genetic
manipulation of the BSF for further optimisation of its
eciency. In addition, comparison to other dipteran
genome sequences will identify longer time frame pat-
terns of conservation and evolutionary divergence.

Project title: Causes and consequences of mutational
variation in the mammalian genome
Supervisors: Peter Keightley and Konrad Lohse, Insti-
tute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh,
UK
Project Description
Spontaneous mutations are the ultimate source of ge-
netic variation and are therefore of central importance in
evolutionary biology. Understanding the nature of varia-
tion arising from spontaneous mutation is important for
diverse questions, including the genetic basis of complex
trait variation, the causes of inbreeding depression and
the maintenance of nucleotide variation in the genome.
We are recruiting a PhD student to join our team ad-
dressing such fundamental evolutird), and is open to
applicants from the EU. A key component of the project
is an ambitious, spontaneous mutation accumulation
(MA) experiment in mice, the rst highly replicated MA
experiment in a mammalian species. With our collab-
orators at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology (Ploen, Germany) we are maintaining a large
cohort of MA lines, bred by full-sib mating, for many
generations in the near-absence of selection. Dierent
lines will accumulate dierent spontaneous mutations
and therefore diverge molecularly and phenotypically.
The PhD project is expected to be within some or all of
the areas described below. The project is exible, how-
ever, and can be tailored to the interest of the successful
applicant.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the prin-
cipal supervisor ahead of application to discuss the
project.
A. The nature of variation from new mutation.
(a) Theoretically, inbred lines should harbour little ge-
netic variation, but there are several factors which could
lead to inbred lines harbouring more variation than
expected.| We will test this by quantifying nucleotide
variation in our inbred MA line progenitors by deep
genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. This
step is a necessary for the following two studies.
(b) Variation in the mutation rate within a species have
been little studied, but is fundamental for understanding
the maintenance of genetic variation. We will addressthis question by large-scale deep sequencing and bioin-
formatic analysis of house mouse MA lines of dierent
strains and potentially families of wild house mice.
(c) The relationship between nucleotide and phenotypic
variation arising from mutation are largely unknown.
Divergence between MA lines for complex traits quan-
ties the new mutational variation. We will relate the
accumulation of phenotypic dierences, in traits such as
growth rate, reproductive tness and gene expression, to
dierences in the accumulation of mutations in dierent
genomic site classes among lines.
B. Understanding variation in diversity across the
genome.
Genetic diversity in natural populations varies across the
genome, but the causes of this variation are poorly un-
derstood. It is clear that variation in diversity is caused
by interactions between mutation, natural selection, re-
combination and genetic drift. We will explore avenues
of research that might help tease apart these factors. (a)
Are patterns of diversity across the genome consistent
between dierent species with dierent eective popu-
lation sizes? It will be especially relevant to determine
how diversity relates to the rate of recombination and
the local density of functional genomic elements. (b)
Are there signals in genomic polymorphism data, for
example in the joint frequency distribution of linked
sites that can dierentiate between dierent forms of
selection? We will also explore whether new computer
simulation approaches can be used to eciently model
the joint eects of mutation, recombination, selection
and genetic drift across the genome.
Further Information
The studentship is funded by a 5 year ERC grant, which
includes a substantial budget for genome sequencing,
consumables and travel to conferences.
Training is an integral part of the studentship, includ-
ing attendance of bioinformatics courses and courses in
population and quantitative genetics and statistics run
as part of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology's MSc
in Quantitative Genetics and Genome Analysis.

Germany SocialInsectAgeing
We invite applications for 7 PhD positions within the
framework of the new Research Unit *Sociality and
the reversal of the fecundity/longevity trade-o* (FOR
2281) funded by the German Research Foundation
(DFG) www.so-long.org Why do organisms age? The
genetic underpinnings of ageing seem to be highly con-
served from nematode worms to humans. Across ani-
mals, ageing is characterized by a trade-o between fe-
cundity and longevity, with an increase in fecundity com-
monly associated with accelerated senescence and a drop
in lifespan. A major exception to this pattern is found
within the social insects. Some social insect queens are
record holders with respect to longevity whereas their
sterile workers are short-lived. The aim of the Research
Unit (www.so-long.org) is to explore, in a highly inte-
grative and interdisciplinary fashion, the ultimate and
proximate reasons for the apparent reversal in the fe-
cundity/longevity trade-o associated with sociality by
using all major clades of social insects, with Drosophila
melanogaster as model non-social organism. Projects
will apply a broad range of approaches from experi-
mental manipulation, eld-based studies and molecular
genetic studies (e.g. qt RT PCR, NGS) to theoretical
evolutionary modelling and bioinformatic analyses. Be-
yond the project work, PhD candidates will attend and
learn in workshops, can organize summer schools, have
the opportunity to participate in lab rotations and to
attend international conferences.

Gottingen AnnelidPhylogenomics
The Johann-Friedrich-Blumenbach Institute of Zoology
and Anthropology at the Georg-August-Universitat Got-
tingen is looking to ll the position of a Doctoral/Ph.D.
Student for research on Phylogenomics of Nereididae
(Annelida) using a target enrichment strategy.14 EvolDir July 1, 2018
The position is funded by the German Science Founda-
tion (DFG) for a period of three years, with a salary
according to the German salary scale TV-L E13 (65%),
and should be lled by october 2018.
The nereidid annelid Platynereis dumerilii is the best-
known lophotrochozoan model system. Surprisingly, a
detailed phylogenetic analysis of nereidids is lacking
so far. The main objective of this project is to recon-
struct a well-supported phylogeny for nereidids by using
data from hybrid target enrichment with subsequent
Illumina sequencing. Baits for target enrichment will be
based on a set of transcriptomes from selected nereidid
species generated within this project. This phylogenetic
framework will be used to the current classication of
nereidids and nally provide a stable placement of the
model annelid Platynereis dumerilii. Based on this phy-
logeny, ancestral state reconstruction will be used to
infer the evolution of reproductive modes, life-style and
habitat preference of nereidid worms.
Applicants need to hold a diploma or MSc degree in bi-
ology or a related eld and to have solid experience with
molecular methodology, particularly with respect to
molecular systematics. Experience in generating and/or
analysing next generations sequencing data is desirable.
Knowledge about annelids or other lophotrochozoans
would be helpful, but is not necessary. Working language
is German and English.
Doctoral students are supposed to take part in seminars
and supervising students. This position is designed to
foster young researchers and scientists and give the suc-
cessful applicant the opportunity to pursue a doctoral
degree.
The University of Gottingen is an equal opportunities

megafaunal fruits on Madagascar" (initially limited un-
til 30 September, 2020 (iDiv funding period), 65 % of a
full-time employment) Salary: Entgeltgruppe 13 TV-L
Background:
Madagascar harbours exceptional biodiversity, but this
tropical hotspot also faces increasing threat from hu-
man activities and climate change. Plants with large,
'megafaunal' fruits are common across the ora of Mada-
gascar, especially within the palm (Arecaceae) fam-
ily. However, Pleistocene extinctions of large-bodied
'megafaunal' fruit-eating and seed-dispersing animals
(such as giant lemurs) may have hindered the dispersal
of taxa with megafaunal fruits. In this project we aim
to investigate the micro- and macroevolutionary conse-
quences of dispersal limitation for megafaunal-fruited
palms on Madagascar, using a comparative framework.
Specically, we aim to (i) identify genomic signatures of
dispersal limitation in megafaunal-fruited palm popula-
tions, (ii) reconstruct demographic history and identify
historical genetic bottlenecks in these species, and (iii)
evaluate whether these species may be adapting to dis-
persal by smaller-bodied frugivores, by evolving smaller
fruits with smaller seeds. This project integrates the
elds of plant evolution, phylogeography, and plant-
frugivore interaction ecology. It will be in collaboration
with researchers from Kew Botanical Gardens, UK (Dr.
Bill Baker), Aarhus University, Denmark (Dr. Wolf Eis-
erhardt), the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands
(Dr. Daniel Kissling) and Botanic Garden of the Ruhr-
University Bochum, Germany (Dr. Wolfgang Stuppy),
among others.

provides a full tuition fee waiver, a competitive living
stipend, and a considerable research allowance.Title: Revealing Adaptive Divergence of Aquatic Rubis-
cos (RADAR)
Abstract: Photosynthesis is the most important biologi-
cal process on a planetary scale, and most of the known
life depends on it. Photosynthesis harvests energy from
the sun to combine carbon dioxide and water, and pro-
vide oxygen and the building blocks of life. Surprisingly
for such an important process, photosynthesis is not
very ecient. Less than 5% of energy from the sun is
transformed into chemical energy of sugars by a typical
crop plant like wheat or potato. Imagine how crop yields
could be improved and how much land could be saved
for wildlife if we would nd a way to increase eciency
of photosynthesis! The good news is there are several
potential ways to address this problem. Photosynthesis
is a complex, multi-step process which gives rise to multi-
ple opportunities to address the eciency of the process.
It is possible that multiple solutions could be combined
in a single crop to produce more food and/or biofuel
using less land and water. One of the bottle-necks in
photosynthesis is the performance of an enzyme called
Rubisco which is responsible for the xation of carbon
dioxide into sugars. Almost all organic carbon on Earth
is xed by Rubisco. Bacteria, algae and plants have
dierent forms of Rubisco, and the most ecient ones
are found in marine organisms. Rubiscos from plants
represent 'the tip of an iceberg' yet they attracted most
of the research eort. We propose to look at 'the under-
studied submerged part of an iceberg', Rubiscos from
aquatic archaea, bacteria and algae, which are both the
most abundant and structurally diverse. Aims: nd
and characterize new forms of Rubiscos and their chap-
erones from the aquatic environments for fundamental
research and applications in synthetic biology. Methods:
1. Bioinformatics' tools will be used for bioprospect-
ing of in-house obtained eDNA samples and publicly
available NGS data collected from the aquatic environ-
ments. 2. Codon-optimized genes encoding Rubisco
and its chaperones will be expressed in a range of hosts.
3. New forms of Rubisco and its chaperones will be
characterised using biochemical and structural analysis.
This project is funded and open for citizens of UK and
EU only.
The position will start in 2018 as soon as the suitable
candidate will be found.

A doctorate position is available to study the evolution of
S. American poison dart frogs. Neotropical poison frogs
are a species-rich family (Dendrobatidae) that exhibit a
diversity of mating systems, parental care strategies and
phenotypes. The Brown lab is looking for a student to
develop a research program studying ANY core aspectof the lab's research. The ideal student will be prepared
to conduct eld-based research, have some experience in
molecular ecology/population genetics, genomic and/or
geospatial analyses. The selected candidate MUST be
highly interested in phylogenetics, population genetics,
or genomics. This position includes several trips to
South America and fully funded lab work.
As follows are a few key projects that could be your
graduate research:
*Speciation, species boundaries and hybridization in
the Ameerega bassleri complex: insights from natural
history, acoustic and morphological data, geospatial
data, sub-genomic and paleoclimatology. This group is
a highly diverse group of three species with dramatic
phenotypic variation across its range. It also has experi-
enced several historical hybridization events among the
taxa that have muddled and complicated their evolution-
ary histories. This research will be aimed to understand
factor driving and maintaining speciation in natural
situations.
**Phylogeography and spatial biodiversity patterns of
the poison frog genus Ranitomeya: insights from sub-
genomic data, geospatial analysis and phylogenetics.
The thumbnail poison frogs are some of the most amaz-
ing species on earth| half the taxa are involved in
Mullerian mimicry, they exhibit intensive parental, and
they often display incredible phenotypic variation among
populations... This group in an endless fountain of evo-
lutionary questions.
***The genetic consequences of future climate change:
spatially explicit predictions of within-species genetic
diversity using climatic, demographic, and genetic data.
This research will expand upon a lab methodology that
accounts for climatic, geographic, and biological com-
plexity. This framework is promising for understanding
evolutionary consequences of climate change and guiding
conservation planning.

(DFG) www.so-long.org Why do organisms age? The22 EvolDir July 1, 2018
genetic underpinnings of ageing seem to be highly con-
served from nematode worms to humans. Across ani-
mals, ageing is characterized by a trade-o between fe-
cundity and longevity, with an increase in fecundity com-
monly associated with accelerated senescence and a drop
in lifespan. A major exception to this pattern is found
within the social insects. Some social insect queens are
record holders with respect to longevity whereas their
sterile workers are short-lived. The aim of the Research
Unit (www.so-long.org) is to explore, in a highly inte-
grative and interdisciplinary fashion, the ultimate and
proximate reasons for the apparent reversal in the fe-
cundity/longevity trade-o associated with sociality by
using all major clades of social insects, with Drosophila
melanogaster as model non-social organism. Projects
will apply a broad range of approaches from experi-
mental manipulation, eld-based studies and molecular
genetic studies (e.g. qt RT PCR, NGS) to theoretical
evolutionary modelling and bioinformatic analyses. Be-
yond the project work, PhD candidates will attend and
learn in workshops, can organize summer schools, have
the opportunity to participate in lab rotations and to
attend international conferences.

EvolutionSexDetermination
PhD POSITION : EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY/BIO-
INFORMATICS
The position :
The Breton lab (University of Montreal) is looking for
an ambitious and highly motivated PhD student in-
terested in understanding the genetic and epigenetic
mechanisms of sex determination in the marine mussel
Mytilus edulis.
PROJECT : The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is the most
important cultured mollusc and therefore a major eco-
nomic driver in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Fisheries
and Oceans Canada), and one of the most important in
the world. Once successful in southern North Carolina,
M. edulis has undergone a worrying decline in recent
years in the Atlantic Provinces and the United States.
Dierent hypotheses have been proposed to explain theJuly 1, 2018 EvolDir 23
reasons for this decline: overexploitation, ocean acid-
ication, pollution, diseases, increased predators and
global warming. Notably, global warming has been used
as a hypothesis in several other studies to explain the
decline of blue mussel populations, a result that could
be attributable, among other things, to a drastic change
in the sex ratio (i.e. the ratio of males and females),
which could jeopardize the viability of certain popula-
tions. Indeed, marine mussels and oysters are known to
have a sex ratio regulated by the environment (temper-
ature and/or food). However, unlike oysters, very few
studies have focused on sex determination mechanisms
in marine mussels. A major reason for studying sexual
determinism in mussels relates to their economic and
nutritional importance. It is widely accepted that the
success of livestock operations is largely related to the
characteristics of the breeding populations (natural or
captive), and in particular the need to control sex ratios,
reproduction periods, fecundity and fertility.
This FRQNT-funded project aims to better understand
the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of sex deter-
mination in Mytilus edulis. Therefore, the successful
applicant should have experience or a strong interest
in bioinformatics, evolutionary biology and molecular
biology.
Funding (15K/yr) is available to support the success-
ful candidate for three years in addition to a limited
travel budget. Expected start date is September 2018 or
January 2019. The Universite de Montreal is a French
language institution where graduate work may be un-
dertaken in English or French.
Interested students should contact
s.breton@umontreal.ca and attach a CV, academic
transcript, contact details of two academic referees, and
a brief description of their research interests.
The position will remain open until a suitable candidate
is found.
Please note that only those selected for an interview
(Skype or telephone) will be contacted. Preference will
be given to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.

DevelopmentalPlasticity
PhD Scholarship in Developmental Plasticity
Project: Developmental temperatures as drivers of phe-
notypic change.
Supervisors: Lisa Schwanz, Shinichi Nakagawa, and Rob
Brooks
Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, School of Biolog-
ical, Earth and Environmental Sciences
University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
Environmental temperatures have a profound impact on
developing animals. The Schwanz Lab and collaborators
have recently quantied the impact of developmental
temperatures on reptile traits, and are continuing to
examine how this plasticity impacts animal populations
under changing climates. This project will examine
plasticity in response to developmental temperatures,
plasticity's role in creating phenotypic variation, and
the inuence on population response to environmen-
tal change. Potential projects include: 1) quantifying
temperature-based developmental plasticity across ani-
mal taxa; 2) quantifying and comparing other sources of
developmental plasticity (e.g. maternal diet and oviposi-
tion behavior); 3) analyzing reaction norms of plasticity.
Addressing these issues will determine the relative im-
portance of climate and temperature for organismal
traits, and how they shape animal ecology and evolu-
tion. The studies to be undertaken are exible and will
depend on the student's interests.
The research will employ quantitative syntheses of pub-
lished literature, with potential expansion to focused
empirical experiments in reptiles or invertebrates. The
ideal candidate for this project will have a Bachelor's or
Master's degree in Biology, with an emphasis in animal
ecology and evolution, and a strong interest in pheno-
typic plasticity. Essential skills and experience include:
experience with an independent research project; strong
writing skills; strong statistical skills and competence in
R programming. Experience working with large datasets
would be valuable.

PROJECT: the Short and Long-term Eects of Climate
Change on Vegetation
SUPERVISORS: Dr Daniel Falster, A/Prof Will Corn-
well, and Dr Matin De Kauwe
ABOUT: Climatic change is set to recongure ecological
systems, as key drivers of vegetation composition and
function - such as rainfall and temperature - shift away
from their historical norms. Vegetation will respond over
a range of timescales, from short-term acclimation, to
medium-term adjustments in the abundance of current
species, to long-term evolutionary responses, including
adaptation and/ or selective replacement of species. In
this project, the student will compare the pace and im-
pact of these dierent responses, using process-based
models; and then outline scenarios of alternative future
states.
The student will receive a stipend of $40K AUD per
year for four years, as well as up to $10k each year for
career development. The project is based in the School
of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences, at the
University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia; su-
pervised by Dr Daniel Falster, A/Prof Will Cornwell,
and Dr Matin De Kauwe. Both international and do-
mestic applications are strongly encouraged. Strong
interest and background in quantitative techniques and
eco-evolutionary dynamics is essential.

Supervisors: Michael Kasumovic, Russell Bonduriansky,
and Terry Ord
Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, School of Biolog-
ical, Earth andEnvironmental Sciences
University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
We know that the social environment can have massive
eects on the strength and direction of selection that
adults experience. More recently, however, research has
shown that the adult social environment can also aect
the developmental trajectory, physiological underpin-
nings, and gene expression that juveniles undergo; this
can have important eects on adult phenotypes. This
project will explore the various ways the social environ-
ment aect juvenile development and adult behaviour,
and the role that gene expression plays in moderating
both. Students can take the project in any direction
they wish.
The research will employ quantitative syntheses of pub-
lished literature, with potential expansion to focused
empirical experiments in crickets, spiders, or any suit-
able organism for the study. The ideal candidate for
this project will have a Bachelor's or Master's degree
in Biology, with an emphasis in animal behaviour and
evolution, and a strong interest in phenotypic plastic-
ity. Essential skills and experience include: experience
with an independent research project; strong writing

PredictingAntimicrobialSpread
Note early deadline: Wednesday 11 July
An opportunity has arisen for a D.Phil. (Ph.D.) place
on the BBSRC-funded Oxford Interdisciplinary Bio-
science Doctoral Training Partnership in the area of
Articial Intelligence, specically 'Predicting the spread
of antimicrobial resistance from genomics using machine
learning'.
If successful in a competitive application process, the
candidate will join a cohort of students enrolled in the
DTP's one-year interdisciplinary training programme,
before commencing the research project and joining
Danny Wilson's research group at the Big Data Institute.
See www.danielwilson.me.uk This project addresses the
BBSRC priority area 'Combatting antimicrobial resis-
tance' by using ML to predict the spread of antimi-
crobial resistance in human, animal and environmental
bacteria exemplied by Escherichia coli. Understanding
how quickly antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will spread
helps plan eective prevention, improved biosecurity,
and strategic investment into new measures. We will de-
velop ML tools for large genomic datasets to predict the
future spread of AMR in humans, animals and the envi-
ronment. The project will create new methods based on
award-winning probabilistic ML tools pioneered in my
group (BASTA, SCOTTI) by training models using ge-
nomic and epidemiological data informative about past
spread of AMR. We will apply the tools collaboratively
to genomic studies of E. coli in Kenya, the UK and
across Europe from humans, animals and the environ-
ment, Enterobacteriaceae in North-West England, and
Campylobacter in Wales. Genomics has proven eective
for asking 'what went wrong' in the context of outbreak
investigation and AMR spread; here we will address the
greater challenge of repurposing such information using
ML for forward prediction of future spread of AMR.
Scrutiny will be intense because future predictions can
and will be tested, raising the bar for the biological real-
ism required while producing computationally ecient
tools.Attributes of suitable applicants: Understanding of ge-
nomics. Interest in infectious disease. Some numeracy,
e.g. mathematics A-level, desirable. Experience of cod-
ing would help.
Funding notes: BBSRC eligibility criteria for stu-
dentship funding applies ( https://www.ukri.org/les/-

ular and statistical genomics. Animal domestication,
especially that of the horse, represents one of such his-
torical turning points.
Project The project will focus on analyzing an exten-
sive dataset of (ancient) horse genomes and epigenomes
recently produced in the group to identify the prehistor-
ical and historical modications underlying the origins
of the modern horse. It follows up on our recent pub-
lications demonstrating that modern domestic horses
descend from a domestication wave that replaced in the
3^rd millennium BCE the horse stock that was previ-
ously domesticated in the Eneolithic period (Librado et
al. Science 2017; Gaunitz et al. Science 2018). Iden-
tifying the exact geographical and temporal locus of
this mysterious second domestication centre represents
one of the core objectives of the project. In addition
to cover the key transitional period represented by the
3^rd mill. BCE, our current dataset includes a series of
archaeological contexts within the last 4,000 years where
key equestrian technologies and novel utilizations of the
horse have emerged. It also largely extends our currentJuly 1, 2018 EvolDir 29
knowledge of the worldwide diversity present in modern
horses. The principal supervisor is Professor Dr Ludovic
Orlando (http://amis.cnrs.fr/?Orlando-Ludovic).
We are seeking a highly motivated, hard-working and
productive student who is interested and capable of in-
teracting and contributing to a research team consisting

PHD POSITION IN PLANT-MYCORRHIZAL INTER-
ACTIONS
We are seeking a PhD student with a background (MSc
degree) in ecology, evolutionary biology, or a closely re-
lated discipline. The successful applicant will be based
at the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environ-
mental Studies of the University of Zurich, Switzerland.
The mutualism between plants and arbuscular mycor-
rhizal fungi (AMF) is widespread and has persisted for
over 400 million years. The stability of this mutualism
depends on a 'fair trade' between plants and fungi, and
on mechanisms that protect this system from exploita-
tion by 'cheaters'. Indeed, plants and AMF are able
to discriminate symbiotic partners through a range of
mechanisms and invest selectively into dierent partners,
depending on the relative quality of their service.
The successful applicant will analyze the trade of carbon
and nutrients among plants and AMF in a series of ex-
periments, using methods that include isotope labeling
and molecular tools. The overall objective of the project
is to characterize the strategies of both partners in the
light of game-theoretical and network-based predictions.
A particularly important question will be how strategies
of plants and fungi scale from pairwise interactions to
systems with multiple species involved.
We are looking for a highly motivated, enthusiastic, and
independent PhD candidate who has a strong interest
in ecological and evolutionary questions. An accurate
and clean laboratory working style is absolutely essen-
tial. Experience with standard molecular biological
techniques is benecial. A high standard of written and
spoken English is essential.
The successful applicant will be supported and super-
vised by Pascal Niklaus and Jordi Bascompte (University
of Zurich), Ansgar Kahmen (University of Basel), and
Marcel van der Heijden (Agroscope Reckenholz).

through which this project is funded.
Important parts of the experimental setup have been
prepared so that the successful candidate can capitalize
immediately on previous work. The position is opened
immediately, and the successful applicant should there-fore start no later than September 1, 2018. Salaries will
follow University of Zurich regulations.

Nominations for the Harry Smith Prize in Molecular
Ecology
The editorial board of the journal Molecular Ecology
has established a new prize to recognize the best paper
published in Molecular Ecology in the previous year by
graduate students or early career scholars with no more
than ve years of postdoctoral or fellowship experience.
The prize comes with a cash award of US $1000 and an
announcement in the journal. The winner will also be
asked to join a junior editorial board for the journal to
oer advice on changing research needs and potentially
serve as a guest editor. As with the Molecular Ecology
Prize, the winner of this annual prize will be selected
by an independent award committee.
The prize is named after Professor Harry Smith FRS,July 1, 2018 EvolDir 47
who founded the journal and served as both its Chief
and Managing Editor during the journal's critical early
years. He continued as the journal's Managing Editor
until 2008, and he went out of his way to encourage early
career scholars. In addition to his editorial work, Harry
was one of the world's foremost researchers in photomor-
phogenesis, where he determined how plants respond
to shading, leading to concepts such as \neighbour de-
tection" and \shade avoidance," which are fundamental
to understanding plant responses to crowding and com-
petition. More broadly his research provided an early
example of how molecular data could inform ecology,
and in 2008 he was awarded the Molecular Ecology
Prize that recognized both his scientic and editorial
contributions to the eld.
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words; longer submis-
sions will not be accepted) directly to Rose Andrew
(randre20@une.edu.au) by Tuesday 31 July 2018.

Other: Panama. VolResAssist. Tropical Forest Ecology.
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama-
Bangor University, UK
We are looking for a highly motivated volunteer research
assistant to support us in unravelling the mechanisms
driving secondary succession of tropical forests.
Research Hyper-diverse mature tropical rainforests have
been largely degraded due to human expansion. Re-
covering forests present 70% of the global forest cover.
These secondary forests can restore some of the original
forests' benets, yet they recover slowly and dier to
mature forests in tree species composition. Understand-
ing the mechanisms driving tropical forest dynamics
following disturbance is imperative to promote the re-
covery of ecosystem functionality and mitigate land-use
impacts. Species-specic interactions between trees and
their natural enemies that have evolved for thousands
of years might be the key. Our current project will
assess the impact of soil fungi in secondary succession of
tropical forests. The project will involve eld work and
a large greenhouse study in Gamboa, Panama. This
collaborative project between Bangor University (UK),
Bayreuth University (Germany) and the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute (USA, Panama) will oer
an ideal opportunity to gain research experience in the
tropics!
Job Description The intern will assist in a variety of
tasks, involving eld work (e.g. seed collection), intense
manual labour (e.g. soil sieving) and greenhouse work.
Working hours will vary strongly between days, but
working weeks will never exceed 45 hours. Applicants
must be in good physical condition to be able to meet
the demands of working sometimes long hours under
challenging tropical eld work conditions, i.e. high hu-
midity and heat. Ability to drive a 4x4 transmission
truck is desirable but not required. We expect the intern
to have a strong interest in ecology and to be willing to
follow protocols to ensure the quality of data. We are
more than happy to help in developing and discussing
ideas for own research projects. We will contribute 500
USD to the ight costs. Due to a limited research bud-
get, we cannot oer accommodation, but will help in48 EvolDir July 1, 2018
nding a place to live in Gamboa (rooms in shared ats
are available from 200-250 USD per month, including
all bills). Start date is between May and August 2018,
with earlier availability being preferred. A minimum
stay of 3 months is required. For applicants being able
to join the project in mid-May, the minimum duration
can be negotiated.
Location Gamboa is a small town next to the Panama
Canal. With its vibrant scientic community, it presents
a stimulating background to develop and exchange re-
search ideas and explore a broad variety of ecological
research in the Tropics. Gamboa is an ideal base to dis-
cover Panama and Central America: on your daily stroll
through the town you can watch huge ships passing by
on the canal or discover the forest that starts directly
behind the greenhouses with its fascinating wild-life
(toucans, gigantic butteries, agoutis, etc.). Panama
City can be reached in 45 min via an adventurous bus
ride.
Applicants should send a cover letter, CV and the
names and e-mail addresses of at least two pro-
fessional or academic references to Anita Weissog

will be invited for a Skype chat.
This position will be lled as soon as possible.

Software DAMBE update
Dear Colleagues,
In the last few months I have been testing the distance-
imputing functions for PhyPA (phylogenetics by pair-
wise alignment), by reading a set of unaligned sequences,
computing distances, randomly remove a subset of dis-
tances so that they are \missing" and then impute the
distances. I have accidentally released a DAMBE version
with such testing functions for PhyPA. A new version
has been uploaded. Please download to replace your cur-
rent version. I apologize for this. PhyPA generates trees
comparable to maximum likelihood method in quality
(better for highly diverged sequences). If you have a
PhyPA tree that is not as good, you most likely are
using a test version of PhyPA (where good computable
distances were replaced by imputed distances).(The reason for implementing distance imputation moti-
vated by my eort to elucidate viral phylogeny in which
viruses A may share no homologous sequences with virus
B, so D AB cannot be computed, but a third virus C
may have one sequence segment homologous to A and
another sequence homologous to B, so that D AC and
DBC can be computed. The sequence homology is often
so remote that no meaningful multiple sequence align-
ment can be obtained. Through distance imputation
and PhyPA, a viral tree can then be produced.)
(PhyPA is a function in DAMBE that build phylo-
genetic trees from pairwise alignment. It is accessed
in DAMBE by clicking \Phylogenetics jDistance

ment". DAMBE is freely available at http://-

analysis. * Stevan J. Arnold, Oregon State University,
USA *
This book is a virtuoso synthesis of the theory and appli-
cation of selection and evolution of complex traits. Much
more than an advanced textbook, it is the most com-
prehensive treatment and synthesis of the theory and
analysis of selection and evolution of quantitative traits
to date. * Peter M. Visscher, University of Queensland,
Australia *
This long-awaited volume gives an exceptionally com-50 EvolDir July 1, 2018
prehensive and thoughtful overview of the eld, and
will be invaluable to all those who are trying to under-
stand the genetics of complex traits. As well as covering
quantitative genetics, it gives a thorough treatment of
the most recent methods for making inferences from
DNA sequence data. * Nicholas H. Barton, Institute of
Science and Technology, Austria *
The book is a fabulous resource; it will be the go-to place
to learn about a broad variety of topics in population
and quantitative genetics, from measuring dierences
among populations to estimating selection from genomic
sequence data. A real strength of the book is the ex-
pert overview of the topics alongside pointers to the key
papers for more details. * Sarah P. Otto, University of
British Columbia, Canada *
Their 1998 book has been an essential and popular
teaching and reference text for quantitative geneticists
for 20 years. At last the long promised and awaited
second volume is available, structured to provide both
an introduction for the graduate student and a reference
volume for the seasoned professional. The authors dis-
play both an impressive breadth and depth of knowledge
and ability to explain it. * William G. Hill, University
of Edinburgh, UK *

Wikipedia upgrades
Wikipedia is the rst port of call for most students,
grant panellists journalists and policymakers, not tomention the wider public. The WikiJournal of Science
(www.WikiJSci.org) is an academic journal with an un-
usual feature: Published review articles are copied over
to Wikipedia for added reach and exposure (articles are
often read >100,000 times per year).
The journal couples the rigour of academic peer re-
view with the extreme reach of the encyclopedia. It
is therefore an excellent way to achieve public engage-
ment, outreach and impact public understanding of
science. Peer-reviewed articles are dual-published both
as standard academic PDFs, as well as directly into
Wikipedia. This improves the scientic accuracy of the
encyclopedia, and rewards academics with citable, in-
dexed publications. It also provides much greater reach
than is normally achieved through traditional scholarly
publishing.
Articles can either be on topics currently absent
from Wikipedia, or be updates/overhauls of existing
Wikipedia articles. Presubmission inquiries welcome to
contact@wikijsci.org

CornellU OatGenomics
The position is in the Plant Breeding and Genetics
Section at Cornell University, and is part of a USDA
Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant to breed
more nutritious oat. Oat is uniquely valued among
grain crops for the health-promoting composition of
its seeds. The project will leverage extensive genomic,
transcriptomic, and metabolomic datasets collected in
oat to develop and evaluate methods to improve the
health-promoting composition of oat seed eectively.
We will identify important causal loci and characterize
new mutations aecting seed composition. The Plant
Breeding & Genetics Section, within the School of In-
tegrative Plant Science, trains interdisciplinary scien-
tists in the elaboration of new breeding methods, the
discovery of genetic mechanisms important for economi-
cally important traits, and the development of genetic
stocks, germplasm, and varieties. Cornell University
plant breeders are world leaders in innovative plant
breeding research, teaching, and extension, and we col-
laborate globally.
This lab works with several crop species (wheat, oat,
barley, cassava, and the brown algae sugar kelp) to de-
velop genomic prediction methods and integrate them
optimally within breeding schemes. We source tools
from genomics, quantitative, statistical, and population
genetics, and from machine learning and operations re-search. With the Jannink lab, Dr. Michael Gore and
Dr. Mark Sorrells provide leadership on the multiomic
oat selection project.
In research for this project, the postdoc will collabo-
rate with oat breeders at the Universities in Minnesota,
Wisconsin and South Dakota, as well as a postdoctoral
associate currently working on the project. We have
characterized an oat diversity panel of 384 genotypes
with high-density DNA marker data, RNA-seq gene ex-
pression data, and non-targeted LC-MS, GC-MS, and
targeted fatty acid methyl ester data of mature oat
seed. We will analyze these data to identify important
genomic drivers of the mature oat seed metabolome.
Results from this analysis will guide the sequencing of
80 target genomic segments in a population of 1,920 oat
TILLING (Targeted Induced Local Lesions In Genomes)
lines. TILLING lines mutated for putative metabolomic
regulators will be evaluated to validate their function.
We have also used these data to select 15 crosses among
elite oat cultivars and will characterize 50 inbred progeny
from each cross. We will assess whether results from
the multiomic analysis of the diversity panel enables
improved prediction among full-sib progeny for seed
composition traits.
Term is one year renewable to three years contingent on
performance and continued funding.
The candidate would be expected to contribute needed
metabolomics expertise to the project. The postdoc
responsibilities will therefore involve work on experi-
ments with new oat lines and interpreting the output
of metabolomic assays and connecting metabolite levels
to gene expression and genotype through knowledge of
biochemistry. In collaboration with other project per-
sonnel, the postdoc will conduct and interpret genome-
and transcriptome-wide association studies. These stud-
ies should result in the identication of genomic regions
targeted for sequencing in the TILLING population.
Identied regions will also be used to inform genomic
prediction models aimed at improving breeder selection
of oat seed composition traits.
Position Requirements Ph.D. in plant biochemistry or
metabolomics with experience or interest in breeding
applications, or Ph.D. in plant or animal breeding with
emphasis on biochemistry, metabolomics, nutritional
science. Proven scientic writing ability and communi-
cation skills.
Preferred Specic Skills Genome-wide association stud-
ies and genomic prediction methods. High-dimensional
data analysis. Programming skills in R or other quanti-
tative / statistical scripting. Basic bioinformatics skills
(sequence alignment, use of gene annotations). Basic
notions of mating designs in breeding.54 EvolDir July 1, 2018

. Principal investigator: Stephane Guindon (CNRS)
. Associate| investigator: Raphael Leblois (INRA).
. Host institution: CNRS-University of Montpellier,
France. . Funding:| ANR. . Net salary: ~2100 eu-
ros/month (including health insurance). . Starting date:
October 2018.
A| 24 month postdoc| position| in| population
genetics| is available| at the| University| of Mont-
pellier, France.| The successful| candidate will| join
the \Methods and| Algorithms in Bioinformatics"
group and work| in close collaboration with other
Montpellier-based research teams.
The main objective of the project is to develop, imple-
ment and apply original inference techniques for tting
the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot model , i.e., a coales-
cent model in which individuals are spatially distributed
along a continuum, as opposed to discrete demes. A
particular emphasis will be put on proposing techniques
that are able to cope with genomic data. Preliminary
work suggests that sequential Monte Carlo algorithms
applied to SNP data could serve as a basis to build e-
cient inference techniques. Modern simulation-based ap-
proaches, such as random forest ABC [2], the summary
likelihood| method [3] and deep-learning techniques
[4] will also be considered.
Application of the proposed methods to simulated and
real-world whole genome data will then reveal the ability
of the new techniques to estimate population density
and migration rate from the analysis of geo-referenced
genetic data.
The ideal candidate| for the proposed project will
have| a PhD in population genetics or statisti-
cal phylogenetics,| although pure statisticians and
physicists| interested| in molecular evolution should|
also apply. Good| skills in data| analysis with mod-
ern tools| and programming languages (R and/or|
Python and/or Java or C/C++) are essential.
Montpellier is a vibrant city on the Mediterranean coast
with a large student community. Cycling to the seatakes about 30 minutes and the back country oers

Postdoc Position in Adaptation and Speciation (NTNU,
Taipei, Taiwan)
A two-year postdoc is available on August 1, 2018 for
an innovative and motivated person to work on the
adaptation of Pachyrhynchus weevils or the speciation
of endemic Psolodesmus damselies.
Project:
The position is funded by the MOST (Ministry of Sci-
ence & Technology, Taiwan) grants focused on testing
hypotheses about the adaptation of aposematic colours
in Pachyrhynchus weevils and the process of species
formation in two subspecies of Psolodesmus damselies.
1. Aposematism of Weevils
Pachyrhynchus weevils are a group of brilliant, metallic-
coloured weevils distributed in the Old World tropics.
Recent studies showed that the conspicuous colouration
of these weevils function as eective warning signals
for their hard bodies to prevent predacious pursuit by
lizards. We are interested in studying the adaptation,July 1, 2018 EvolDir 57
evolution, and spatio-temporal dynamics of interactions
between vertebrate predators and aposematic prey using
these weevils.

2. Damsely Speciation
We focus on a damsely species, Psolodesmus mandari-
nus, with two subspecies dier in their distribution and
wing pigmentations in Taiwan. It provides a great oppor-
tunity to evaluate the relative importance of natural and
sexual selection in damsely divergence. The project
will incorporate a wide range of techniques, including
a whole-island eld survey, behavioural studies, manip-
ulation experiments, population genetics and genomic
analysis to investigate the divergence in damselies.
A description of the research project:

Description
Description:
The Moorjani Lab (https://moorjanilab.org/) at Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley has a post-doctoral position
available for motivated candidates with background in
statistical population genetics and/or data science.
Our lab focuses on using statistical and computational
approaches to study questions in human genetics and
evolutionary biology. A central aim in the lab is to
understand the impact of evolutionary history on ge-
netic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how wecan leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities:
A successful candidate will develop and apply compu-
tational approaches to large genomic datasets to char-
acterize patterns of population history and evolution.
The main responsibilities include conducting research,
attending regular lab meetings and journal clubs, and
preparing research results for publication and presenta-
tions at scientic meetings. Opportunities may also exist
for mentoring graduate and undergraduate students.
Minimum/Basic Qualications required at the time of
application:
- Completion of all doctoral degree requirements ex-
cept the dissertation in genetics, computational biology,
biostatistics, population genetics or related elds.
Additional Qualications (required by start date):
- PhD or equivalent degree in genetics, computational
biology, biostatistics, population genetics or a related
eld.
- Knowledge of statistics and population genetics theory.
- Demonstrated record of research productivity and pub-
lications.
- Programming experience (e.g. C/C&#43;&#43;,
Python/ Perl, R or other programming languages)
Preferred Qualications:
Experience with large-scale genomic data analysis.
Salary: This is a full-time position. Salary is commen-
surate with qualications and experience.

postdoctoral applicants with interests/expertise in any
of the following areas: *speciation genomics, functional
morphology, quantitative genetics, or craniofacial devel-
opment*.
Ongoing potential projects in the lab include:
1) Estimate the genetic architectures of novel adaptive
traits within Caribbean pupshes using a combination of
QTL mapping crosses, divergence mapping from whole
genome resequencing, GWAS, allele-specic expression,
and analyses of selective sweeps and introgression.
2) Measure the relationship between genotype, pheno-
type, and tness across a complex tness landscape
estimated from the growth and survival of F2 hybrid
pupsh placed in eld enclosures on multiple Bahamian
islands.
3) Functional and high-speed kinematic analyses of scale-
eating performance in the wild and across a phenotypic
continuum of laboratory hybrids.
4) Validation of candidate regulatory variants using in
situ hybridization and CRISPR knockouts in the pupsh
system.
The postdoc will have the option to participate in eld-
work in the Bahamas and/or Cameroon, but previous
eld experience is not necessary and participation is not
required.
Required qualications:
Ph.D. or equivalent degree in biology, evolution, genet-
ics, bioinformatics, or related eld. Publication of work
based on dissertation. Programming experience in R

UFlorida MNH Phyloreferencing
We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to support the
Phyloreferencing project <http://phyloref.org/ >by
developing and advocating driving biological research
use cases, and to coordinate these with large research
projects in comparative biodiversity. Our ideal can-
didate is a biologist by training with strong expertise
in systematic biology, and a deep interest in research
questions that benet from enabling a phylogenetic (as
opposed to a taxonomic) perspective for integrating bio-
diversity data at a level that depends on computation.
The Phyloreferencing project aims to create the data
standards and computational resources to render phylo-
genetic clade denitions <https://doi.org/10.2307/-
2992353 >, specically their semantics, fully com-
putable. A major part of our eort is to build
an ontology of published and peer-reviewed phyloge-
netic clade denitions expressed in the Web Ontol-ogy Language (OWL) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-
Web Ontology Language >, as well as the machine rea-
soning capabilities to resolve such denitions to clades
in a given phylogenetic tree, including at the scale of
the synthetic Open Tree of Life.
One role of the postdoc is to provide critical guidance
and inform prioritization of software development ef-
forts by developing, advocating, and ideally pursuing
compelling research questions as use cases. As part of
being compelling, such use cases should demonstrate
how the phylogenetic view that phyloreferencing enables
for linking data is dierent from traditional solutions
to this problem (such as identifying clades manually,
or using taxonomic checklists and synthetic taxonomy
backbones).
The other major role of the postdoc is to serve
as an ambassador of the project both to the com-
parative biodiversity research community at large,
as well as in particular to select research projects
(such as NSF GoLife <https://www.nsf.gov/funding/-
pgm summ.jsp?pims id=5129 >-funded projects, or the
ARBOR <http://arborworkows.com/ >project) that
could benet from our technologies for integrating or
communicating trait data with other biodiversity data
resources at a large-scale. We expect that as a result
at least some of our driving research use cases would
be informed by or even actively coordinated with such
projects, and the postdoc initiating and leading deeper
collaborations would be welcome.
By rendering the semantics of phylogenetic clade de-
nitions fully computable, phyloreferencing also enables
computationally reproducing, disambiguating, and eval-
uating the eect of changing such clade denitions, fea-
tures lacking in or made very dicult for taxonomic
name-based approaches. Candidates with research ideas
that take particular advantage of these features are
equally encouraged to apply. More generally speaking,
we are particularly interested in how you might incorpo-
rate phyloreferencing into your own research projects,
current or future.
The Phyloreferencing project is a collaboration between
Dr. Nico Cellinese (Florida Museum of Natural History,
University of Florida) and Hilmar Lapp (Center for Ge-
nomic and Computational Biology, Duke University)
funded by the National Science Foundation. The post-
doc will be based in the lab of Dr. Cellinese, but will
work closely with both PIs. Starting date is negotiable.
Salary is $50,000.
Qualications:
* PhD in Biology or a related eld. * Strong back-
ground in Systematic Biology required. You should be68 EvolDir July 1, 2018
well versed in all aspects of theoretical phylogenetics
and related topics. * Programming experience in lan-
guages popular in scientic computing (e.g., Python,
JavaScript) is useful (and thus preferred) but not re-
quired. * Similarly, prior exposure to or familiarity with
ontologies and ontology languages (in particular, OWL)
is useful but not required. * Excellent communication
and writing skills, and ability to interact productively
with other projects' PIs and personnel.
How to apply:
Please submit a letter of interest and CV, together with
the names and contact information of three academic ref-
erences, to Dr. Nico Cellinese (ncellinese@mnh.u.edu).
All other inquiries should also be directed to Dr. Celli-
nese. The position will remain open until lled.

InsectVirusSymbiosisDevelopment
Postdoctoral position on insect-viral symbiosis
This NSF-funded position is for research on evolution,
development, symbiosis and insects. Specically, the
lab has funding for work on developmental events that
guide insect-microbe interactions using parasitoid wasps
as a study system: wasps that lay eggs in other in-
sects and consume them during development. Several
lineages of wasps have acquired associations with ben-
ecial symbiotic viruses that are specically produced
in wasp reproductive tracts and are injected into host
insects. There, they play vital roles in preventing hosts
from mounting eective defenses against the developing
parasitoid. The production of virus in wasps is verytightly timed and coincides with specic stages of wasp
development. The lab is seeking an energetic postdoc
with interests in some of these topics and a strong back-
ground in one or more of the following: developmental
biology, evolutionary biology, genomics, or molecular
genetics. The position is in the Entomology department
at the University of Georgia and is available immediately

UHelsinki EvolutionaryEcol
The University of Helsinki has an international aca-
demic community of 40,000 students and sta members,
and it oers comprehensive services to its employees,
including occupational health care and health insurance,
sports facilities, and opportunities for professional devel-
opment. The International Sta Services oce assists
employees from abroad with their transition to work
and life in Finland. The Organismal and Evolutionary
Biology Research Programme is situated at the Viikki
science park and belongs to the Faculty of Biological
and Environmental Sciences of University of Helsinki.
The Organismal and Evolutionary Biology Research
Programme (OEB) invites applications for a
1,5 YEAR POST DOCTORAL RESEARCHER POSI-
TION in Evolutionary Ecology
in the research group of Marjo Saastamoinen (http:/-
/www.helsinki./life-history-evolution), as part of the
ERC funded META-STRESS project. The successful
applicant will be part of the
Research Centre for Ecological Change at the University
of Helsinki.
Our Life-History Evolution research group is a dynamic
team with several post docs and PhD students and we
are part of the OEB with its vibrant and collaborative
research community of experimental, computational,
and theoretical labs that all share a common interested
in Evolutionary Biology. Cutting edge infrastructure is
available at all levels, including high-performance com-
puter clusters, a next-gen sequencing facility, as well as
molecular labs. We collaborate with research groups at
Cambridge University, Stockholm University, and UCL
among others.
The project, initiated in 2015, aims to understand the
mechanisms that allow organisms in the wild to cope
with environmental stress. Working with the largemetapopulation of the Glanville fritillary buttery gives
a unique opportunity to study processes operating from
genes within individuals all the way to metapopulation-
level dynamics ( >20 years of data; e.g. Kahilainen
et al. GCB). In this project ecological and experimen-
tal studies are integrated with molecular approaches
to unravel the signicance of dierent mechanisms -
candidate genes, epigenetic inheritance and intestinal
microbial communities - potentially inuencing individ-
ual responses to environmental challenges.
In addition to exceptional demographic and ecological
resources, substantial genomic data is also available for
this species, including a whole genome sequence (Ahola
et al. 2014 Nature Comm) and linkage map (Rastas
et al. 2013 Bioinformatics) for which a new version
is underway and ready to be utilized. Some available
experimental and genomic data, including across land
PoolSeq, RNA Seq and sequence data of mothers and
their ospring exposed to dierent stressors, and SNP
genotype data from 20,000 individuals genotyped for
both known candidate genes and neutral loci across
hundreds of populations (Fountain et al. 2016 PNAS,
Fountain et al. 2018) is potentially available for the can-
didate. There is also an option to generate/collect new
experimental and/or genomic data within the framework
of the META-STRESS project.
The successful candidate should have PhD / postdoc-
toral experience within the elds of evolutionary biology,
evolutionary genetics, microbiology or similar, and a
strong interest in working with natural populations.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills in
English, and the ability to think independently and cre-
atively are required. The candidate must demonstrate
ability to work as part of a team, and participate in
supervision of more junior group members.
The starting date is exible but preferable no later than
September 2018 (funding is available until end of March
2020), with a probationary period of six months. The
salary will be based on level 5 of the demands level chart
for teaching and research personnel in the salary system
of Finnish universities. In addition, the appointee will
be paid a salary component based on personal work
performance. Starting salary will be 3300 euros/month,
depending on the appointee's qualications and experi-
ence.

2-year Postdoctoral Fellow position in Animal Phys-

Viblanc and Dr F Stephen Dobson at the University of
Strasbourg, Institut Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien,
France.
Social networking in the Columbian ground squirrel: a
bio-logging approach linking animal behavior to individ-
ual health and ageing
Ageing is likely inuenced by social biology in group-
living organisms. However, the mechanisms of interac-
tion between social stressors and stress-related health
issues are poorly studied, and the impact of social stress
on organismal tness is virtually unknown. Our re-
search will integrate the links among social stressors,
physiological stress indicators, and individual tness
in a colony of ground squirrels observed since 1992.
Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus)
are semi-social sciurid rodents that inhabit sub-alpine
meadows of the Rocky Mountains of Canada and the
northern US. They have a matrilineal social system
where related individuals overlap both spatially (kin
clusters) and over generations. Our current research
indicates that individual tness benets are acquired by
co-breeding with neighbours that are close kin. However
the consequences of social heterogeneity on individual
physiology and health are unknown.
In this project we will explore the eects that the social
environment has on adult phenotype, using a bio-logging
approach to measure individual social contacts both
above and below ground. We will use an innovative ap-
proach, via large scale deployment of >80 novel contact
collars coupled with 3D-accelerometers and magnetome-
ters to establish continuous networks of social inter-
actions throughout the breeding season, and connect
individual social attributes to their underlying physi-
ology (glucocorticoid stress hormones, oxidative stress
markers, immunity markers and telomere dynamics).
More information on the MamTag project can be found
here.
Research will be based at the Institut Pluridisciplinaire
Hubert Curien (Strasbourg, France, website), and eld-
work will be carried out in the Sheep River Provincial
Park (Alberta, Canada, website). The applicant should
have a keen interest in working with free-living mammals
in outdoor conditions.July 1, 2018 EvolDir 79
The post-doctoral fellow will be responsible for imple-
menting the rst stage of the MamTag project. This will
include (1) standardization and pre-analysing accelerom-
eter, magnetometer and contact data collected in 2018
(Dec 2018-Mar 2019), (2) deploying loggers and collect-
ing data (including physiological samples) in the eld
(Apr-Jul 2019), (3) analysing logger signals and devel-
oping programming routines to establish social contact
networks and animal behaviour (Aug-Mar 2020). The
post-doctoral fellow will also assist with the supervision
of a PhD student associated with the project, whose
research will focus on the social determinants of tness.
The second year of the project will be used to analyse
physiological samples at the IPHC and the Centre for
the Neurobiology of Stress, University of Toronto, and
publish the results.
For this post-doctoral project we are seeking someone
who works well in a team environment; who is mobile,
creative, highly motivated; and who has a keen inter-
est in integrating animal physiology, behavioural and
evolutionary ecology. Our ideal candidate will have a
proven record of working on complex signal analyses
(accelerometer, compass and environmental data) and
developing specic toolboxes for signal analyses (strong
expertise in signal processing with Matlab/R/Python).
Previous experience working in the eld (long hours out-
doors, animal handling) and in the lab (ELISA, RIA) is
preferred but not essential; the willingness to learn such
techniques is, however, required. The candidate should
have excellent written and oral communication skills in
English and an excellent publication record.
The successful applicant will be mainly based in the
Department of Ecology, Physiology & Ethology (DEPE)
at the University of Strasbourg, France, under the joint
supervision of Dr Vincent A Viblanc and Dr F Stephen
Dobson. The DEPE is a lively Department where the
post-doctoral fellow will benet from interaction with a
thriving community of postgraduate students, postdocs
and researchers in animal physiology, marine biology
and behavioral ecology. Furthermore, the applicant will
integrate with an international team, and will thus bene-
t from the interaction and support of research partners,
including Rudy Boonstra (University of Toronto), Do-
minique Filippi (Sextant Technology, New Zealand),
and Fran??ois Criscuolo (IPHC CNRS). The applicant
will participate in University of Strasbourg Institute for
Advanced Studies (website) actions such as seminars
and related activities.

EvolutionBiologicalClocks
Postdoctoral Position: Evolution of Circadian Rhythms
in Bacteria
Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA: Laboratory of
Dr. Carl Hirschie Johnson
The Position: Dr. Johnson is seeking a highly motivated
postdoctoral fellow to study the evolution of circadian
(daily) clocks in bacteria by experimental and bioin-
formatics methods, including the use of an innovative
experimental evolution approach.
Background: The eld of circadian clocks received the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2017 for its
progress towards understanding the mechanism of cir-
cadian oscillators. While these biological clocks display
conserved properties from bacteria (especially cyanobac-
teria) to fungi, plants, insects, and vertebrates (includ-
ing humans, of course), practically nothing is known
about their evolution or about the selective pressure(s)
that led to the evolution of these fascinating biological
timekeepers. The laboratory of Dr. Johnson led the
discoveries of circadian clocks in bacteria, in particular
major contributions to the mechanism of the circadian
system in cyanobacteria. Moreover, Dr. Johnson's labo-
ratory is the major (and practically the only) laboratory
that has provided experimental support for the tness
advantage of circadian clocks (see PMCID: PMC21132;
PMID:15324665; and PMCID: PMC3633149).
The Project: Inspired by studies from other laboratories
of bacterial experimental evolution to relatively simple
selective pressures, the Johnson Laboratory has under-
taken an experimental evolution approach using E. coli
(that does not exhibit circadian phenomena) under avariety of rhythmic environmental regimes to evolve
clock-like behavior. This experimental evolution has
been conducted for eight years by the technician in the
laboratory, and is now exhibiting interesting phenotypes
that need a conscientious and motivated postdoctoral
fellow to characterize and analyze. The methodology
will include genetic/bioinformatic methods (genome se-
quencing, analysis of adaptive mutations, RNAseq, etc.),
physiological/imaging methods (to most fully charac-
terize phenotypes using luminescent and/or uorescent
reporters), proteomic methods (analyzing gene expres-
sion patterns), and metabolomic methods (temporal
changes in metabolism in response to rhythmic environ-
ments).
In addition to the experimental evolution project, the
candidate will also be involved in analyses of the adap-
tive signicance and mechanism of biological timekeep-
ing in purple bacteria and cyanobacteria (see PMCID:
PMC4794148). For an overall introduction to these re-
search questions, see our review in Nature Reviews in
Microbiology (PMCID: PMC5696799).
The Candidate: The ideal candidate has strong moti-
vation and should ideally be driven by a passion for
evolutionary biology. Expertise in genetic technology
with bacteria and bioinformatics is a plus. The position
requires the ability to independently take responsibility
for the project, as well as strong teamwork & communi-
cation skills, problem-solving abilities, reliability, and
eective time management.
Research environment and location: There are excellent
facilities and collaborations available within the Vander-
bilt University system, including other laboratories that
study circadian clocks (e.g., the labs of Doug McMahon,
Terry Page, and Beth Malow) and evolutionary biology
in microbes (e.g., the labs of Antonis Rokas, Seth Bor-
denstein, and Ann Tate). Nashville is an exciting city
with a low cost of living and many artistic opportunities
(especially music) as well as close proximity to nature.

Place: Capellades, Barcelona (Spain).
Instructors: Diego Rasskin-Gutman (Cavanilles Insti-
tute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, Spain)
and Borja Esteve-Altava (The Royal Veterinary College,
UK).
Course overview
Anatomical Network Analysis (AnNA) is a framework
for quantitatively characterizing the topological organi-
zation of anatomical systems using tools from Network
Theory. AnNA is emerging as a new tool to identify de-
velopmental constraints, measuring morphological com-
plexity and modularity, building morphospaces, and
modelling the growth of anatomical structures.
This course is entitled to teach the main concepts of
AnNA. Students will learn the basics of network analysis
applied to morphological and anatomical systems: gath-
ering information, building network models, analysing
them, and interpret the outcomes of their analysis. This
course combines theoretical introductions and practicalexercises using the free and open-source software R and
RStudio.
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data
for practising and for the supervised project session;
anatomical networks will be provided by the instructors
if needed.
This course is addressed to PhD students, postdocs and
senior researchers.

SECOND CIRCULAR: postgraduate course \INTRO-
DUCTION TO NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING:
APPLICATIONS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION"
in Barcelona (Spain) from 2nd to 6th July
Dear all,
here you can nd information about the postgraduate
course \INTRODUCTION TO NEXT-GENERATION84 EvolDir July 1, 2018
SEQUENCING: APPLICATIONS IN ECOLOGY AND
EVOLUTION" (3 ECTS credits) which whill take place
in the Faculty of Biology (Universitat de Barcelona),
Barcelona, from 2nd to 6th July. The Institut Bot anic
de Barcelona (CSIC), the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos
and the IRBio-Universitat de Barcelona participate in
the course organisation, with the support of the Fun-
daci on General CSIC and the EVOLTREE network.
The course is aimed at graduates, postgraduates and
PhD students on Evolutionary Biology and related sci-
ences, interested in knowing the new tools and the po-
tential that is being developed with the new techniques
of massive parallel sequencing. No specic training in
bioinformatics is necessary although basic knowledge is
desirable.
The main objective of this course is to show a battery of
potential applications of the NGS by researchers who are
currently working with this technological approach. As
an introductory course, the main purpose is not looking
for a complex or deep training in a specic technique,
but to give a broad view of the available approaches.
The assistant to this course should end with the feeling
of knowing the techniques and their applications, with
the purpose of being able to assess which ones may be
interesting for their research or on which to deepen in
later stages.
The specic objectives are:
1. To present an updated information on the dierent
NGS techniques and their applications, potential and
complexity.
2. To provide basic training in the main software for
each of the techniques, as well as in data processing,
and give tips on how to expand knowledge. This in-
cludes from the quality analysis, edition and analysis of
the les to the interpretation of results. We aim that,
with this basic knowledge, the student can be trained
later if he is interested in a specic aspect of the ones
addressed (for example, attending specialized courses or
self-taught).
3. To favour the contact between students interested in
specic techniques with teachers and specialized person-
nel, for possible collaborations or training.

The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.

Overview
This course will introduce students, researchers and pro-
fessionals into the eld of using genomics data to identify
meaningful genomic regions. The course comprises two
approaches: one based only on genomic information,
which will use populations genetics techniques to detect
signatures of selection (both natural and articial); the
other approach will combine genomic and phenotypic
data to identify genetic associations for specic pheno-
types (i.e. GWAS, genome-wide association studies).
Format
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning how to make
use of genomic information to study how selection has
shaped the genome and how the genome inuences mea-
surable phenotypes. It will include information useful
for both beginners and more advanced users. We will
start by introducing general concepts of population ge-
netics, which will take up most of the rst half of the
course; the second half of the course will be centered
mainly on GWAS and related aspects.
Attendees should have a background in biology, specif-
ically genetics. There will be a mix of lectures and
hands-on practical exercises using R and the Linux
command line, and bespoke software. Some basic under-
standing of R programming and the Linux environment
will be advantageous. Attendees should have also some
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments, including genotyping-by-sequencing
(GBS), and commercial genotyping platforms.

Dr. Stephane Joost (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Oliver Selmoni, MSc (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Course overview
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, the course
will discuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic
data and subsequently show how to study genetic vari-
ation and population structure across space in the R
environment. Students will be given an overview of the
dierent statistical approaches to study local adapta-
tion, and will be trained in using two of them, Sambada
and LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task
of the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-
nally, the course will consider the crucial aspects and
good habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed BackgroundJuly 1, 2018 EvolDir 87
This course is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneti-
cists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evo-
lutionary biology and conservation. Even though the
course is not intended for a specialized audience, basic
knowledge in evolutionary biology and population ge-
netics would help. Students will learn how to use GIS,
but basic computer skills are desirable (e.g. in the R
environment). A basic understanding of statistics is also
necessary.
Teaching Format
The course is organized in ten learning sessions. During
the rst two sessions, the course will provide a contex-
tualization of the research eld. Then, students will be
guided through a landscape genomics experiment with
sessions that couple brief theoretical introductions with
practical work.

Berlin PythonDataVisualization
Oct15-19
Course: Data Manipulation and Visualization with
Python
Berlin, 15th-19th October 2018
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course38/ )
INSTRUCTOR:
DR. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists: (
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/) )
Overview
One of the strengths of the Python language is the avail-
ability of mature, high- quality libraries for working with
scientic data. Integration between the most popular
libraries has lead to the concept of a \scientic Pythonstack": a collection of packages which are designed to
work well together. In this workshop we will see how
to leverage these libraries to eciently work with and
visualize large volumes of data.
Format
The workshop is delivered over ten half- day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at
the organizer's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
The last two sessions will be kept free for students to
work on their own datasets with the assistance of the
instructor. A description of the sessions can be found
at the bottom of this page.
Assumed Background
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a basic knowl-
edge of Python (if you've taken the Introductory Python
course then you have the Python knowledge; if you're
not sure whether you know enough Python to benet
from this course then just drop us an email).
Requirements
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the example datasets. They
should also have some basic Python experience (the
Introduction to Python course will fulll these require-
ments). Students should be familiar with the use of
lists, loops, functions and conditions in Python and
have written at least a few small programs from scratch.
Students will require the scientic Python stack to be
installed on their laptops before attending; instructions
for this will be sent out prior to the course.

oer a training course in Environmental Genomics, aim-
ing to better understand technologies and approaches
used to discover how gene function is inuenced by
environmental conditions while accounting for varia-
tion that exists within and among natural populations.
This course is built on the paradigm that the research
eld will most eectively grow by properly designing
large-scale experiments enabled by drastically increased
sample-throughput and lower sequencing costs. Most
importantly, the bioinformatics challenges of manipulat-
ing and analyzing population-level genomics data must
be addressed.^ a e^ ae
This course is designed to train the next-generation ofenvironmental scientists, which have included in past
years: university professors, postdoctoral researchers,
doctoral students and government scientists, represent-
ing institutions from North America and Europe. Most
responded in the departure survey that the course cur-
riculum, choice of technologies, and eectiveness pro-
vided sucient training to either begin or enlarge an
environmental genomics project in their own labora-
tories. All reported that they would recommend this
course to a colleague.
This course trains researchers to design studies, and
to collect and analyze RNA-Seq gene expression data.
Daphnia is used for training because of its growing use
as a model system for environmental genomics and for
improving environmental health protection, yet the skills
learned during the course will be applicable to all study
systems with maturing genomics resources, including
humans. Much time is devoted to guiding the current
and future projects of attendees.
Ultimately, participants will be better positioned to
incorporate these technologies into their own research
laboratories, while better understanding how functional
genomics and automation can be applied to ecology,
evolution and environmental toxicology.^ a e

* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics
of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives,
QTL analyses. * Phylogeny: examining the history of
evolutionary changes of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.

QuebecCity eDNAmetabarcoding
Nov19-23
Workshop: eDNA Metbarcoding
When: 19-23 November 2018
Where: Institut de Biologie Integrative et des Systemes
(IBIS), Laval University, Quebec City (Quebec), Canada
Instructors:
Dr. Vasco Elbrecht (University of Guelph, Canada)
Eric Normandeau (Laval University, Canada)
Website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course40/ Course Overview
Obtaining environmental DNA (eDNA) from water,
soil, air, gut content or other sample types holds great
promises for biodiversity research and assessment. Tar-
geted species specic markers, and broader, more inclu-
sive metabarcoding approaches using universal primer
sets can detect invasive and rare rare species, or the
range of taxa present in ecosystems from trace amounts
of DNA. eDNA can capture sample diversity using
non-invasive or minimally invasive methods/techniques.
However, due to the low quantity of DNA present in
samples, these approaches often require specialized lab-
oratory protocols, careful sample handling to prevent
contamination, as well as specialized bioinformatic pro-
cessing due to high levels of noise and the presence of
non-target taxa.
After completing the workshop, students should be in a
position to (1) understand the potential and capabilities
of eDNA barcoding and metabarcoding, (2) run com-
plete analyses of eDNA metabarcoding pipelines and ob-
tain diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable
data from raw next-generation sequence data and (3) de-
sign their own eDNA projects, including bioinformatic
data analysis and planning of laboratory work. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically92 EvolDir July 1, 2018
to participants.
While this course will focus on eDNA metabarcoding,
however targeted single species detection and other al-
ternatives will also be explored, as they can sometimes
be suitable metabarcoding alternatives.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research, and researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing eDNA
community. This workshop will review mostly tech-
niques and software useful for eukaryotic single species
detection and eDNA metabarcoding. Other workshops
focused on procedures currently used in bulk sample and
microbial metabarcoding will be available from Physalia-
courses. A survey will be provided 2 weeks ahead of
the workshop, where participants can mention topics or
aspects they are particularity interested in.
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments. Please make
sure to have linux installed if you bring a Windows
based laptop. Among the software and tools we will
be using is R or Rstudio (+ the JAMP & PrimerMiner
package), FastQC, Usearch, Vsearch, Cutadapt, and
mBRAVE.net. No prior knowledge of these software
packages is required.
TEACHING FORMAT
The workshop is delivered over 5 days (see the detailed
curriculum below). The lectures are interactive with
active discussion where asking questions is strongly en-
couraged. A key aspect of this course are practical
sessions in primer development, bioinformatic analysis
of high throughput sequence data, and data visualiza-
tion as well as a project planning exercise to apply what
you learned in this course.

QuebecCity PopulationGenomics
Nov12-16
Workshop: Population Genomics
When: 12-16 November 2018
Where: Institut de Biologie Integrative et des Systemes
(IBIS), Laval University, Quebec City (Quebec), Canada
Instructors:
Dr. Martin Taylor (University of East Anglia, UK)
Dr. Lewis Spurgin (University of East Anglia, UK)
Eric Normandeau (Laval University, Quebec City,
Canada)
Website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course39/ Course Overview
Next generation sequencing has revolutionized evolu-
tionary biology allowing unprecedented resolution and
insight into evolutionary questions that appeared in-
tractable only a few years ago. The course will cover
the basics of population genomic analysis from SNP
data onwards and will cover the key analyses that may
be required to successfully analyze a population ge-
netic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-
nomic analysis and be competent in population genomic
analysis.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
This workshop is aimed at postgraduate students and
early career researchers who are interested in using pop-
ulation genomic tools in their research. No previous
experience of bioinformatics is required, but an under-July 1, 2018 EvolDir 93
pinning in evolutionary biology and basic population
genetics concepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
and F[ST] are desirable. The course will use a range of
software including the Linux operating system and R.
TEACHING FORMAT
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists of
a combination of lectures and practical exercises, with
breaks at the organisers' discretion. There will also be
time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.

Reminder for: Bioinformatics Analysis for Conservation
Genomics
October 10-19, 2018
Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation, Front Royal,
VA, USA
https://smconservation.gmu.edu/programs/-
graduate-and-professional/profe ssional-training-
courses/conservation-genomics/
This new course is designed to provide attendees at any
career stage with a theoretical understanding of the
methods used in conservation genomics along with the
practical skills necessary to design and carry out the
analysis component of a conservation genomics study.
While introduction to the theoretical aspects of each
of the analytical steps will be given, the emphasis of
the course will be on hands-on training, enabling the
participants to complete the analysis steps behind a
conservation genomics study. Thus, the course will
follow the format of short lectures introducing each
analytical step, followed by hands-on activities during
which students will complete the corresponding analysis.The course will begin with an overview of conserva-
tion genomics, comparison of dierent next generation
sequencing platforms, and the analytical factors to con-
sider when beginning a conservation genomics study.
The rest of the course will focus on the bioinformatics
analysis behind a conservation study including: genome
assembly (trimming, assembly techniques, quality as-
sessment), genome annotation, mapping low coverage
genome data to a reference genome, SNP calling, de-
mographic analysis, and estimation of genome-wide di-
versity. These steps will all be accomplished with real
data used in a recent conservation genomics study and
performed on the Smithsonian High Performance Com-
puting Cluster (SI/HPC). By the end of the course,
attendees will have acquired the necessary background
and applied knowledge to implement genomic analyses
for the conservation of endangered species.
The Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation is a
partnership between George Mason University and the
Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). All
courses are intensive residential programs hosted in
a sustainably-built Academic Center on the grounds
of SCBI in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. All courses
oer continuing education credits (CEUs) and some
can be taken for graduate credit. Limited scholarships
are available for eligible applicants. See our upcom-
ing oerings below and check out our website (http://-

Ancient DNA: A Time-machine to Study Evolution
While the sequencing of DNA extracted from fossils has
been attempted since 1983, several technological revolu-
tions such as rigorous lab practices and the availability
of next-generation sequencing now make it possible to
obtain high-quality ancient DNA data for many organ-
isms. This opens up an unprecedented opportunity to
include data from multiple time points when studying
evolutionary processes such as past demographic events
or the action of selection.
In this workshop we will explore the range of evolu-
tionary questions that will benet from ancient DNA,94 EvolDir July 1, 2018
and discuss important considerations in designing and
executing research projects using ancient DNA, as well
as best practices in analyzing ancient DNA data. While
the ancient DNA eld had arguably its largest impact
on the study of human evolution, we want to focus on
its broader implications: how can ancient DNA help to
disentangle the eect of selection and demography? How
should modern population genomic analyses be tailored
to be applicable to ancient DNA? What are appropriate
samples sizes for ancient DNA to make a real contribu-
tion? And the ultimate question for participants: would
the inclusion of ancient DNA data make a dierence in
answering my evolutionary research questions?

UK FunctionalEcology Nov26-30
Functional ecology from organism to ecosystem: theory
and computation (FEER01)
This course will be delivered by Dr. Francesco de Bello,
Dr. Lars G otzenberger and Dr. Carlos Carmona and
will take places in Glasgow city centre from 26th - 30th
November 2018.
Course Overview: The course will describe dierent
aspects and methods in the eld of functional ecology,
combining theoretical lessons with hands-on real data.
Lectures will provide the theoretical and mathematical
basis for dierent applications of functional traits at
organismal, community and ecosystem levels, with ex-
amples across dierent trophic levels. This will serve as
a basis for exploring the practical tools to connect theJuly 1, 2018 EvolDir 95
eect of land-use and climate change on biodiversity to
the eect of biodiversity on to multiple ecosystem func-
tions and ecological services. An overview of existing
computational methods, including recent developments
authored by the lecturers, will be provided during the
course and the students will learn how to apply them
using functions and scripts run in R. Students are wel-
come to apply these tools to their own data, or use
the data provided, to be analysed during the course
while beneting from advise by the lecturers. As such,
compared to other courses given by the lectures, this
is a slightly a more advanced and data oriented course
which concentrates on detailed and practical aspects
in functional traits related applications, especially com-
putational ones. The aim of the course is to provide
participants with a handy synthesis of existing concepts,
tools and trends in functional ecology and guide them
to apply these tools to their own eld of interest. As
the eld of functional ecology is rapidly expanding, par-
ticipants will be ready to exploit the potential of the
main trait approaches.

Statistical modelling of time-to-event data using sur-
vival analysis: an introduction for animal behaviourists,
ecologists and evolutionary biologists (TTED01)
https://www.psstatistics.com/course/statistical-
modelling-of-time-to-ev ent-data-using-survival-
analysis-tted01/
This course will be delivered by Dr Will Hoppitt in
Glasgow and will run from the 21st - 25th Jan 2019.
Course Overview:
Survival analysis is a set of statistical methods initially
designed to analyse data giving the times at which indi-
viduals die, and assess the eect that dierent predictor
variables have on the rate of death. However, its ap-
plications are much broader than this: it can be used96 EvolDir July 1, 2018
to analyse any time-to-event data. Ecologists and evo-
lutionary biologists often encounter data of this kind.
Often factors inuencing survival itself will be of inter-
est. But there are many other cases, e.g. what factors
inuence the time of rst breeding? Or the time taken
to reach maturity? Animal behaviourists too will en-
counter this type of data frequently, e.g. what factors
inuence the time it takes to learn a novel behaviour pat-
tern? Or the time to respond to a stimulus? etc. And
yet the techniques of survival analysis are not generally
well known by researchers in these disciplines.
In this course, you will learn how to apply survival
analysis models to quantify the eect that predictor
variables (continuous or discrete) have on the rate at
which events occur, and how to test hypotheses about
these eects. We will focus on a exible modelling
technique called the Cox proportional hazards model,
which makes minimal assumptions about the underlying
probability distributions. You will learn how to t and
interpret these models, how to evaluate its assumptions,
and how to extend it to model time dependent variables,
random eects, multistate models and competing risks
models.

monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.98 EvolDir July 1, 2018
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
