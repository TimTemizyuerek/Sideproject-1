The Sixth International Conference on Serpentine Ecol-
ogy - June 16 - 23, 2008
The conference will be held on the campus of the Col-
lege of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, located on Mount
Desert Island on the rocky coast of Maine. The Confer-
ence provides an opportunity for the gathering of ser-
pentinophiles from around the world, every 2-4 years,to share and discuss their ﬁndings relating to the broad
and inter-disciplinary ﬁeld of serpentine ecology. Par-
ticipants include botanists, zoologists, ecologists, pedol-
ogists, geologists, microbiologists, evolutionary geneti-
cists and conservation biologists studying aspects of
plant-animal-soil relations of serpentine (ultramaﬁc)
outcrops. Many attendees work across disciplines to
explore the fascinating relationships that exist between
extreme habitats and life.

Edinburgh Phyloinformatics
Oct22-24
This October 22-24 there is a phyloinformatics work-
shop at the e- Science Institute in Edinburgh, Scot-
land, hosted in conjunction with the Isaac Newton In-
stitute for Mathematical Sciences’s Phylogenetics Pro-
gramme. For more details visit the web site: http://-
www.nesc.ac.uk/ esi/events/710/ .
Background
As phylogenetics scales up to grapple with the tree of
life, new informatics challenges have emerged. Some are
essentially algorithmic - the underlying problem of in-
ferring phylogeny is computationally very hard. Large
trees not only pose computational problems, but can be
hard to visualise and navigate eﬃciently. Methodolog-
ical issues abound, such as what is the most eﬃcient
way to mine large databases for phylogenetic analysis,
and is the “tree of life” the appropriate metaphor given
evidence for extensive lateral gene transfer and hybridi-
sation between diﬀerent branches of the tree. Phylo-
genies themselves are intrinsically interesting, but their
real utility to biologists comes when they are integrated
with other data from genomics, geography, stratigra-
phy, ecology, and development. This poses informatics
challenges, ranging from the more general problem of
integrating diverse sources of biological data, to how
best to store and query phylogenies. Can we express
phylogenetic queries using existing database langauges,
or is it time for a phylogenetic query language? AllAugust 1, 2007 EvolDir 5
these topics can be gathered together under the head-
ing “phyloinformatics”. This workshop brings together
researchers with backgrounds in biology, computer sci-
ence, databasing, and mathematics. The aim is to sur-
vey the state of the art, present new results, and explore
more closely the connections between these topics. The
3 day workshop will consist of 10 talks from invited ex-
perts (45 minutes each), plus 3 group discussion sessions
(45 mins - 1 hour each). A poster session will be held
in the middle of the meeting for investigators who wish
to present their results, and there be also be time set
aside for additional discussion and interaction.

temporary molecular phylogenetics and a number of
related disciplines, including molecular biology, evolu-
tionary biology, biochemistry, computer science, and
bioinformatics. The conference is aimed at gatheringleading scientists from Russia and abroad in compu-
tational biology, genomics, theory and application of
comparative analysis of genetic blueprints. The confer-
ence mission is to provide a stimulating platform for
exchange of ideas and experiences, cross-disciplinary
interactions, and long-term national and international
collaborations. Participation of postgraduate and post-
doctoral fellows is encouraged to foster development of
the next generation professional network.
The conference scope includes but is not limited to:
* computational analysis of DNA, RNA and protein
sequences; * methods and algorithms of phylogenetic
analysis; * oriented software development; * parallel
and distributed computing in genetic data analysis,
datamining; * evolution of genome, regulatory elements
and genetic control systems; * dating evolutionary di-
vergences with molecular data; * phylogenetics in hot
topics of organismal evolution and systematics, phy-
logenomics; * applied molecular phylogenetics (barcod-
ing, molecular anthropology, molecular epidemiology,
forensic science, etc.).
Further information on the conference is available
from the announcement text attached. Your in-
quiries will be answered upon request at front-
desk@cps2007.bio.msu.ru or rusin@iitp.ru.

Synopsis
The rapid growth of genetic sequence data has pro-
vided much-needed power for resolving controversial
species relationships and studying the evolutionary pro-
cess, but has also posed many statistical and computa-
tional challenges to the ﬁeld. This meeting will bring8 EvolDir August 1, 2007
together scientists with a diverse range of backgrounds,
and in particular researchers actively developing sta-
tistical methods and computational algorithms used in
modern phylogenetics software. Statistical and com-
putational challenges facing the ﬁeld will be discussed
in the meeting, for example, eﬃcient tree search al-
gorithms under likelihood, Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithms for Bayesian phylogenetics, estimation of
species divergence dates by incorporating uncertainties
in the fossil record and statistical tests of phylogenies.

poster session.
In the 1960s the advent of protein electrophoresis rev-
olutionized the ﬁelds of genetics and evolutionary bi-
ology, and Dr. Fred Utter, with his team of scientists
at the Montlake Laboratory (current headquarters of
Northwest Fisheries Science Center), were among the
ﬁrst to adopt these methods for application to natu-
ral ﬁsh populations for conservation and management.Dr. Utter also developed a strong relationship with the
University of Washington School of Fisheries (now the
School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences) that enabled
many students to gain experience with and be trained
in the use of genetics and evolutionary biology as ap-
plied to ﬁsheries management issues. Many of these
students are now prominent ﬁgures in the ﬁeld. To
build on that legacy, we are sponsoring a Symposium,
dedicated to Fred Utter and his six decades of contri-
butions to ﬁshery genetics, that will be both retrospec-
tive (reviewing applications up to the present day) and
prospective (looking ahead to new developments in the
next decade).

ETH Zurich BombusHostParasiteETH Z¨ ı¿1
2rich, Institute of Integrative Biology (IBZ)
The Experimental Ecology Group (Paul Schmid-
Hempel) is seeking to ﬁll a
Ph.D. Position (Diversity of parasites in natural sys-
tems)
to work on questions of host-parasite interactions using
Bombus spp. and their parasites as the study system.
In particular, the proposed framework for this study
is to investigate the diversity of pathogens in natural
populations of various Bombus species. Our questions
ultimately relate to the co-evolutionary dynamics of the
host interactions with protozoa, viral and bacterial par-
asites, the epidemic processes in natural populations, or
the spread and eﬀect of infectious parasites in ecologi-
cal communities of host species. We work with molec-
ular tools but the emphasis in this project would be on
ecological studies in populations and communities. In
particular, little is known about the occurrence, dis-
tribution and correlates of parasitism in the diverse
sets of Bombus species. The project aims at gather-
ing this knowledge, and use it to test some major con-
cepts of ecological theory and host-parasite coevolution.
Although the prime motivation are questions of basic
importance, the project is embedded in a larger set of
studies conducted at ETH addressing the signiﬁcance of
ecological and genetic variation in natural systems with
respect to disease, climatic change and environmental
degradation.
The ideal candidate likes to work with this system, an
interest at the crossroads of ecology, genetics and evo-
lution and a background in any of the relevant ﬁelds.
Salary and other conditions in accordance with local
regulations. The normal duration of a PhD at ETH is
3 years. Special conditions for acceptance into the PhD
program of ETH may apply; a degree equivalent to a
M.Sc. is normally required. Preferred starting date 1
October 2007 or thereafter. Please send applications,
with CV, names of referees, and short statement of your
interests in this position to Prof. Paul Schmid-Hempel,
preferably by email (psh@env.ethz.ch). Screening of
applications will start 15 August 2007 or until post is
ﬁlled. For more information, you may check our web
page ( www.eco.ethz.ch ).

ImperialCollege SilwoodPark
TaxonomicBiasAugust 1, 2007 EvolDir 11
A NERC funded PhD studentship is available at Im-
perial College’s Silwood Park Campus, Ascot, UK to
work on any of the following projects. Anyone inter-
ested should contact Donald Quicke as soon as possible
at the address below including a brief CV, statement of
why they are interested and in which project, contact
details and names and contact details of 2 academic
referees. Applicants should hold at least a 1st or Upper
Second class degree in a relevant subject or equivalent.
The grant provides living expenses and tuition fees for
UK citizens.
Project 1 - An investigation into bias in taxonomy
Systematic bias in the way taxonomic research is car-
ried out is a major stumbling block in understanding
global diversity. Such bias can start in the ﬁeld as col-
lection bias: some methods favouring some taxa over
others. Of the the specimens collected, only some will
end up being prepared and mounted as museum spec-
imens, and only some will end up being studied in de-
tail and end up being assigned to existing species, or
described as new species. It has been shown in several
taxa that larger organisms tend to be described before
smaller ones, probably because larger taxa are both eas-
ier to ﬁnd and easier to study. In addition, bias exists
amongst geographic regions with tropical areas tending
to be less well studied than temperate areas.
This project aims to detect, quantify and ﬁnd meth-
ods to correct for such bias using data from existing
databases, study of museum specimens and records,
ﬁeld studies carried out in various tropical and temper-
ate localities. The research will focus on the large par-
asitic wasp superfamily Ichneumonoidea and will lead
to a better understanding of the regional trends in life
history strategy within the group.
*****
Project 2 - Molecular food-webs of tropical woo-borer
parasitoids
Very few host records exist for parasitoids of tropi-
cal xylophagous insects compared with the diversity of
potential hosts (mostly wood-borer beetle larvae) and
their host trees. Consequently there is understanding of
what features of hosts or host substrate are most impor-
tant for structuring these food-webs. A major aspect of
this lack of information is the diﬃculty of rearing par-
asitoids in the tropics and having conﬁdence that they
are actually attacking a given species of concealed host
- rather than some other insect in the substrate. DNA
sequencing can potentially overcome this enabling both
parasitoid and host to be identiﬁed without the prob-
lem of rearing.
This project will comprise a mix of ﬁeld sampling, andexperimentation with lab-based DNA sequencing at Sil-
wood.
****
Project 3 - Identiﬁcation of noise and hidden signals in
phylogenetic data sets
All real phylogenetic data sets contain a mix of signals.
It is the hope of most phylogenetic algorithms that the
’strongest’ signal reﬂects the true phylogeny. However,
in addition to nearly random noise (as might be ex-
pected from neutral mutations in DNA sequences) such
secondary signals may reﬂect suites of characters being
selected in response to, for example, ecological factors
or life history features independent of the group’s phy-
logeny. This project aims to develop methods whereby
such ’hidden’ secondary signals can be extracted from
data sets, and will use these to explore existing and
novel data sets, particularly involving parasitic wasps.

SpeciesRangeDynamics
Species range dynamics and global change.
NERC Funded PhD studentship Division of Biology,
Imperial College London.
Understanding how species respond to habitat loss
driven by global change allows conservation planning
to be forward-looking. Instead of focussing solely on
current patterns of biodiversity, such an understanding
would permit conservationists to identify which areas
are likely to retain their importance and which areas
may increase in importance, for example as a refuge
from habitat loss. At present, models commonly use
species’ current environmental preferences to identify
suitable areas under projected global change scenarios.12 EvolDir August 1, 2007
This project will use data on species’ geographic ranges
to investigate ways in which the current spatial patterns
of diversity may help to inform the future movements
of those species.
This studentship will be supervised by Dr. David Orme
at the College’s Silwood Park campus. The campus
is home to the Ecology and Evolution section and to

Potsdam GlobalChangeAdaptation
3-Years GRANT for a Ph.D. student ECOLOGY Pots-
dam (Berlin) GERMANY
Within the Potsdam Graduate Initiative on “Modelling
the response of populations, species and communities to
global change” a grant for a Ph.D. student is available
from now onwards to study
the
Propagation of variability patterns from individual
populations to complex food webs based on an out-
standing data set on long-term observations of plank-
ton abundance with high taxonomical resolution and
using advanced techniques for time-series analysis such
as spectral and wavelet analysis. This Potsdam Gradu-
ate Initiative conducts interdisciplinary research and an
education program which deals with diﬀerent ecologi-
cal and evolutionary aspects of the response of popu-
lations, species, and communities to global change and
other anthropogenic impacts. The PhD projects com-
bine recent developments in theoretical ecology as well
as process-based and statistical ecological modelling to
answer and is linked to our EU Programme FEMMES
and other project on ecological modelling.
The project mentioned above is supervised by
Prof. Dr. Ursula Gaedke (Ecology & Ecosys-
tem Modelling, Institute for Biochemistry and Bi-
ology; http://www.bio.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/-
oekosystemmodellierung ), Prof. Dr. J¨ ı¿1
2rgen Kurths
(Nonlinear Dynamics, Institute for Physics; http://-
www.agnld.uni-potsdam.de/ ) and Dr. David Vasseur,
Calgary, Canada.
Variability patterns of natural populations and com-
munities are of focal interest e.g. within the ongoing
biodiversity-stability debate. Extending previous re-
search (e.g. Vasseur et al. (2005, OIKOS), Huber &
Gaedke (2006, OIKOS) and Vasseur & Gaedke (2007,
Ecology), all papers are available upon request), we aim
to study variability patterns at diﬀerent temporal scales
at the level of individual phyto- and zooplankton pop-
ulations, how they are related to ecological character-
istics of the species and trophic interactions within the
food web, and how they propagate to the level of func-
tional groups, communities and the entire food web.14 EvolDir August 1, 2007
The mechanistic understanding is enhanced by relating
these variability patterns in biomass to those of pro-
duction which indicate the turn-over rates within the
system.
Applicants must have an above-average Master’s de-
gree or equivalent in Natural Sciences and a good back-
ground and interest in statistics and theoretical ecology.
The willingness, both to do interdisciplinary research
and to actively participate in the activities of the Pots-
dam Graduate School, is a prerequisite for the applica-
tion.
Applications, preferably in electronic form, should be
send as soon as possible and should include a CV,
copies of degree certiﬁcates, and possibly a letter of
recommendation to Prof. Dr. Ursula Gaedke (email:

PurdueU HighwaysAsBarriers
PhD Assistantships in Wildlife Ecology and Genetics
Two PhD students are sought within the Department
of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue Univer-
sity to collaborate on a project evaluating the role of
Interstate Highways as barriers to dispersal, gene ﬂow,
and metapopulation stability for small and medium-
sized mammals in the state of Indiana. The goals of
this project are to: 1) utilize genetic data to assess
the role of Interstate Highways as barriers to disper-
sal and gene ﬂow in a suite of mammals which vary in
size and dispersal ability, and 2) utilize high resolution
telemetry data and spatially explicit individual based
simulation models in conjunction with genetic data to
understand the mechanisms underlying the isolating ef-
fects of interstate highways. Students will work coop-
eratively on extensive live trapping of study animals
(eastern chipmunks, fox squirrels, gray squirrels, andraccoons) in order to collect tissue samples, mark and
recapture subjects for density estimates, deploy radio
collars for movement studies, etc One student will work
with Dr. Gene Rhodes to explore the genetic conse-
quences of interstate roads on the movement behavior
and population structure of the focal species. The sec-
ond student will work with Dr. Pat Zollner to utilize
high temporal resolution telemetry data on movement
patterns for development of spatially explicit individ-
ual based models for each species. Both students are
expected to have excellent academic credentials includ-
ing the completion of a relevant (wildlife, ecology, ge-
netic, modeling, etc..) M.S. degree prior to arrival at
Purdue. For the position in Dr. Rhodes’ lab it is de-
sirable for the student to have prior experience with
the collection of microsatellite genotype data and the
analysis of spatially explicit genetic data. For the posi-
tion in Dr. Zollner’s lab it is desirable for the student
to have prior experience using individual based mod-
els and coding computer programs (preferentially in
C#). Both students should have demonstrated an abil-
ity to work well in team settings because this project
will require them to cooperate extensively with each
other as well as with the project’s PIs and other col-
laborators within Purdue and the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources. PhD stipends in the Depart-
ment of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue for
January admissions are based on an annual ﬁgure of
$19,140.00. Students interested in applying for either
of these positions should submit a statement of interest,
a C.V., GRE scores and their cumulative GPA along
with the name and contact information of three refer-
ences to Drs. Rhodes or Zollner for initial evaluations
by July 30, 2007. Note that review of oﬃcial appli-
cations for admission into the Department of Forestry
and Natural Resources will begin September 15th 2007
and the selected candidates are expected to begin their
program of study at Purdue in January of 2008. Ques-
tions about the genetic portion of the project can be
addressed to Dr. Gene Rhodes (rhodeso@purdue.edu;
765- 494-3601). Questions about the simulation mod-
eling portion of the study can be addressed to Dr. Pat
Zollner (pzollner@purdue.edu; 765-496-9495).

TrinityCollege HybridAsh
Graduate position Trinity College Dublin (TCD) &
Teagasc invites applications to undertake an MSc/PhD
research project entitled:
Identifying the scale of suspected hybrid ash (F. excel-
sior x F. angustifolia) in Ireland’
Ash is an important hardwood species for farm forestry
in Ireland. The Irish government introduced substan-
tial planting grants around 1992 for farmers to plant
trees with an extra premium for planting hardwood
species including ash. Consequently plants and seeds
of several species were imported to ﬁll the needs (from
various sources including France, Czech Rep, Poland
and the Netherlands). Many of these plantings devel-
oped poor morphology and growth. It was clear that
the problem was due to the source of the material and
that the imported material was probably hybrid ash
derived from F. excelsior and F. angustifolia. Today,
there are at least 100 aﬀorested sites in which suspected
hybrid ash was planted. There is a lack of understand-
ing of hybrid ash in general, its occurrence in Ireland,
and potential of it to interbreed with native ash. This
proposal therefore aims to carry out a set of morpholog-

UArkansas EnvGenomics
Ph.D. Graduate Assistantships, Environmental Ge-
nomics at the University of Arkansas and University
of Nevada, Las Vegas
Two NSF-funded graduate research assistantships are
anticipated to support Ph.D. candidates interested in
functional genomics of adaptation to stressful environ-
ments. The project involves laboratory and ﬁeld ex-
periments designed to discover patterns of gene expres-
sion in populations of cactophilic Drosophila mojaven-
sis. Our general goals are to uncover whole-genome
patterns of gene expression in populations exposed to
natural abiotic and biotic stress. Ultimately, we wish
to pinpoint clusters of functionally interacting genes ex-
pressed throughout the life cycle in diﬀerent environ-
ments, and predict limits of phenotypic plasticity and
adaptation, particularly in response to stressful envi-
ronments and long-term global climate change. Lab-
oratory experiments will involve DNA microarrays to
study gene expression changes due to diﬀerent host
cacti and environmental stresses, as well as diﬀerences
in epicuticular hydrocarbons. Field-related work will
include monitoring of wild ﬂies, demography of wild
populations, and analysis of hydrocarbon and RNA
proﬁles. The positions are part of a collaborative
project involving the Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville,
and the Univ. of Nevada, Las Vegas. One research as-
sistantship will be available at each institution. Please
note that these positions are contingent upon receiving
ﬁnal funding approval from NSF.
Applicants must gain admission to the Ph.D. pro-
gram in the Department of Biological Sciences at
the University of Arkansas or the School of Life
Sciences at UNLV. Application information is avail-
able at http://biology.uark.edu/1251.htm andhttp://-

A Ph.D. position in molecular evolutionary biology is
available in the lab of Axel Meyer in the Department of
Biology at the University of Konstanz in Germany. The
evolutionary biology group is an international group of
students and postdocs that also includes the labs of
Gerrit Begemann on zebraﬁsh developmental genetics
and Shigehiro Kuraku on evolutionary developmental
biology. The main language spoken in the lab is En-
glish.
We are looking for an energetic Ph.D. student who is
interested in speciation, molecular evolution, bioinfor-
matics/genomics, or evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy. The speciﬁc research projects we are recruiting for
involve (1) research on phylogenetics and population ge-
netics of cichlid ﬁshes (2) as well as the discovery and18 EvolDir August 1, 2007
functional characterization of (e.g. coloration) genes
underlying the diversiﬁcation of cichlid ﬁsh in Africa
and in Nicaragua.
The great lakes in East Africa house some of the world’s
most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Lakes Victoria,
Malawi and Tanganyika are particularly well-known
for their adaptive radiations of hundreds of endemic
species of cichlid ﬁshes. We are interested in under-
standing speciation, phylogeography, molecular evolu-
tion and molecular phylogenetics of these cichlid ﬁsh
assemblages. Also, we wish to identify and charac-
terize the function of genes that are involved in the
phenotypic diversiﬁcation and presumably speciation
of cichlid ﬁshes. Several molecular biological, “devo-
evo” and genomic approaches, including candidate gene
approaches, DNA-chip technology, characterization of
ESTs, in situ hybridization in cichlids and transgenics
in zebraﬁsh are used to address these questions. We
are also interested in evolutionary genomic questions
and the evolution of novel gene functions after gene
and genome duplications.

4 YEAR PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven (B)
A 4 year PhD position for an evolutionary biologist is
immediately vacant at the Laboratory of Aquatic Ecol-
ogy (Catholic University of Leuven) in the research
group of Prof. Filip Volckaert to study Strong selec-
tion pressures and micro-evolutionary responses in the
three-spined stickleback.
Description: The project investigates the conceptual
and methodological integration of ecology and evolu-
tionary biology. The successful candidate will study the
evolutionary response of the three-spined stickleback to
strong selection pressures (predation and parasitism) in
an ecological context. Patterns of phenotypic variation
will be explored in natural populations and phenotypic
adaptation tested experimentally. The stickleback is a
prime model for evolutionary research with access to
an impressive molecular toolbox, enabling the under-
standing of the link between phenotypic and genomic
responses to environmental and anthropogenic factors.
Evolution in sticklebacks has been studied in our team
over the past ﬁve years (see Raeymaekers et al. 2005
and 2007, Molecular Ecology). The project starts on 1
October 2007 and is supervised by prof. Filip Volckaert
and dr. Joost Raeymaekers.
The team: The Fish Genetics Team has a strong
expertise in neutral and adaptive evolution, includ-
ing ﬁeld monitoring, experimental design, medium-
throughput genotyping, the analysis of genetic, ge-
nomic, and phenotypic data with up-to-date statisti-
cal approaches, and modeling for heuristic and oper-
ational analyses. Topics addressed include phylogeny,
barcoding, phylogeography, population genetics, local
adaptation and rapid evolution (natural and ﬁsheries
induced), enhanced selection in aquaculture (aquacul-
ture genomics), co-evolution between host and parasite,
spatio-temporal dynamics of nursery grounds and the
management of aquatic habitats. Our team comprises
6 PhD students, 4 postdocs, 2 technicians and a team
leader. The historic KULeuven, founded in 1425, has
a very stimulating research environment. The modern
city of Leuven with its medieval roots oﬀers a high qual-
ity of life.
Proﬁle: High motivation, background in evolutionary
biology, interest or experience in ﬁeld based experimen-tal research is strongly recommended. Research will
be carried out in collaboration with a multidisciplinary
team of ecologists, evolutionary biologists and popula-
tion geneticists.
Financing: The successful candidates fellowship (ap-
proximately 1600 / month netto) is funded by a na-
tional project of excellence (GOA). The candidate is
expected to apply for a national IWT fellowship.
Application deadline: Please send a letter of motiva-
tion, C.V., and two letters of reference to Filip Volck-
aert by 6 August 2007.

UNottingham EvolBiol
The Institute of Genetics within the School of Biology
at the University of Nottingham oﬀers the following
MRes courses in Evolution for start September 2007:
Evolutionary Biology: The MRes in Evolutionary Bi-
ology involves the study of adaptation of organisms to
their environment, at the whole organism and molec-
ular scales. Studies available include the evolution-
ary and behavioural ecology of insects and mammals
and other species, genetic variation in wild populations
of fungi, ecological genetics, and the interface between
evolution and development. In addition, a number of
researchers are interested in estimation of the deep phy-
logeny of major groups of organisms, such as pulmonate
molluscs and protists. One of our staﬀ members, Angus
Davison, uses an evolutionary approach to attempt to
understand the origin of the use of ’sex’ darts during
courtship in slugs and worms.
Molecular Evolution: The MRes in Molecular Evolu-
tion involves the study of the evolutionary relation-
ships among organisms and gene families using molecu-
lar methods, with evolutionary trees (phylogenies) gen-
erated from the analysis of DNA and protein sequences.
The programme involves both laboratory work (DNA
extraction, PCR and sequencing) and bioinformatics
(DNA sequence alignment and phylogeny reconstruc-
tion). Research areas within which projects are avail-
able include: studies on the evolutionary relationships
in the molluscs (in particular the land snails) and the
link between molluscan phylogenies and biogeography;
studies on the molecular taxonomy of spiders and the
link between rates of molecular and morphological di-
versiﬁcation; studies on the evolution of spider silk gene
families and the relationship between silk diversiﬁca-
tion and speciation; studies on the phylogeny of the
foraminifera and the distribution of diﬀerent genetic
types across the oceans; and studies on genetic diversity
and cryptic speciation in nematodes.
Population Genetics: The MRes in Population genetics
involves the study of the genetic variation that exists
in wild populations, and the forces, such as selection,
mutation and genetic drift, that shape this variation.
Particular interests in the School involve the molecu-lar genetic variation of humans, and variation in wild
populations of molluscs, foraminiferans and Drosophila.
Projects may include studies on molecular evolution
and phylogenetics using computer analysis of DNA and
protein sequences; the genetic changes that are asso-
ciated with speciation; evolution of transposable ele-
ments; and the population genetics of genome struc-
ture.
Comparative Genomics: With whole genome sequences
being available for numerous organisms across all king-
doms of life, numerous questions concerning genome
evolution to gene function, phylogenetic relationships
to genetic and metabolic networks, genotype to pheno-
type of complex traits, can be addressed through com-
parative genomics. Bioinformatic analysis of related

PhD Scholarship, Evolutionary Genomics and Sexual
Selection
A PhD Scholarship is available in Steve Chenoweth’s
lab at the University of Queensland, Australia. Broad
areas of interest include, but are not limited to, in-
tragenomic conﬂicts and the evolution of sexual dimor-
phism, the genetic basis of sexually-selected traits and
mating preferences, and the evolution of reproductive
character displacement. Our approach is largely empir-
ical and uses a model Australian Drosophila system, D.
serrata, to study sexual selection and its consequences.
The range of genomic tools available for D. serrata, is
expanding and presently includes QTL mapping lines,
an EST library and custom microarray platform, with
SNP panels and a BAC library under development.
Projects are free to involve any combination of ﬁeld
work, population genomic, quantitative genetic and ex-
perimental evolution approaches. Students with inter-
ests in statistical genetics are also encouraged to apply.
Available: immediately
Eligibility: All nationalities, with applicants who are
not Australian or New Zealand citizens or residents re-
quired to apply for a fee-waiver from the University.

UZurich TheoBiol
Numerical Analyst, Computational Scientist or Applied
Mathematician for Ph.D. position in theoretical biology
at the University of Zurich
A candidate with previous exposure to numerical analy-
sis or computer science is desired for a Ph.D.studentship
in evolutionary biology. The population genetics group
at the Institute of Zoology has formed a research team
to study the evolution of biochemical and morpholog-
ical adaptations in cyanobacteria. The physiology of
the latter class of organisms exhibits two of the most
important biochemical adaptations in the history of
life: nitrogen ﬁxation and photosynthesis. They have
also evolved multicellularity. Our group, which is com-
posed of both theoreticians and experimentalists, at-
tempts to understand the evolution of these adapta-
tions through a combination of empirical and theoret-
ical approaches. As a theoretician, the candidate will
be engaged in two classes of modelling approaches. The
ﬁrst is the development of model-based methodologies
for phylogenetic estimation and measures of genetic
relatedness. This would involve the construction of
theoretical models based on population processes, and
the subsequent development of methods for estimat-
ing phylogenetic and population genetic signals arising
from the latter processes. The developed methodology
would then be tested against real data. The second
class of research project focuses on the development of
models for the evolution of biochemical adaptations.
Based on the candidate’s tastes, this can range from
evolution of ODE based models of biochemical pro-
cesses, to more abstract theoretical models of parallel
computation occuring in chemical media. The envi-
ronment of the lab is multidisciplinary and we do our
utmost to accommodate candidates from diverse aca-
demic backgrounds. Working language of the group is
English, though knowledge of German may be a plus
for easing administrative interactions within the Uni-
versity (not to mention improving the candidate’s so-
cial existence). Programming skills in C, R, Python,August 1, 2007 EvolDir 23
Matlab/Maple/Mathematica/Octave would be a plus.
In addition, knowledge of computer architecture, For-
tran77, Assembly, Lisp or familiarity with the internal
workings of numerical analysis or computational alge-
bra packages would be venerated (though clearly not
a must). Previous exposure to evolutionary biology
and/or knowledge of any one of the following areas of
mathematics would be a plus: probability theory, graph
theory and diﬀerential equations. The opportunity ex-
ists to interact with experimentalists. The candidate
should feel comfortable with interacting with biology
students who may not have a quantitative background.
Intellectual ﬂexibility, combined with a genuine interest
in biology are a must.
Ph.D. candidates at the University of Zurich should al-
ready possess a Masters degree (or alternatively, the
equivalent of the Diplom in the German system) at the
time of starting the program. The successful candidate
would be supported by an annual stipend of roughly
38,000 Swiss Franks. Duration of study is usually 3-
4yrs. Interested candidates should send electronic ver-sions of a cover letter and their CV with reference lists
to “evolzurich@gmail.com”. Applicants should men-
tion the earliest date at which they would be able to
start and are also welcome to attach PDF versions of
one or two of their previous publications if applicable
(though prior publication is not a requirement). Appli-
cations will be accepted until August 15th. 2007. Due
to potential high volume of electronic applications, ap-
plicants who have not received a response by August
20th. 2007 may assume that their application was not
successful.

Australia Volunteer SongbirdEvol
Volunteers are needed for work on Brown songlarks in
Australia, Sept-Nov 2007.
If you are interested in getting more ﬁeld experience in
a nice place like Australia, here is an excellent oppor-
tunity for you. We are looking for volunteers that have
a genuine bird interest, and preferably have experience
with bird watching or bird handling.
The project aim to investigate the eﬀect of mater-
nal yolk hormones on nestling growth and begging be-
haviour in the endemic Australian brown songlark. The
brown songlark is one of the worldˆ as most sexually size
dimorphic species, with males being 2.3 times larger
than the female, which make the system very suitable
for investigating sex-speciﬁc maternal eﬀects and sib-
ling competition.
The ﬁeldwork is based in south-eastern Australia and
includes: locating birds and nests, collecting eggs (for
hormone analyses), capturing and ringing birds, hand
rearing of chicks, and behavioral recordings. Volunteers
are needed during three months (Sept, Oct, and Nov).
We provide you with food and accommodation during
your stay. If you have good experience and can stay
during the whole period we can consider paying your
travel expenses. Please send your CV if you want us to
consider that option.

FalklandIslands VolunteerAssist
Wanted - Volunteer Field Assistant on Falkland Islands
October 2007 - January 2008
We are looking for a ﬁeld assistant to help with a project
on the evolutionary ecology and conservation of shore-
birds on the Falkland Islands.
The Project: We are investigating the breeding and
behavioural ecology of two-banded plover (Charadrius
falklandicus) and rufous-chested dotterel (Ch. mod-
estus), and their interactions with predators including
the striated caracara (Phalcoboenus australis). Work
involves searching for and monitoring nests, juveniles
and ringed adults, capturing birds for measurement,
and behavioural assays.
The Place: The Falkland Islands are renowned for their
magniﬁcent bird life, as well as good numbers of other
animals such as elephant seals and killer whales. The
plover project is based on Sea Lion Island ( http:/-
/www.sealionisland.com/index.php/uk/38/ ), the only
site in the Falklands to be an Important Bird Area,
an Important Plant Area, and a proposed National Na-
ture Reserve. It is also a Ramsar designated Wetland
of International Importance. As Darwin observed of
the Falklands avifauna in 1833, the birds on Sea Lion
Island are extraordinarily tame, and it is possible to
study them at close quarters.28 EvolDir August 1, 2007
Accommodation on Sea Lion Island is in a Portakabin,
with occasional hot water and heating. Conditions are
basic, and the weather is harsh, with strong, cold winds
and some rain and snow.
The Field Assistant: We are looking for someone with
a degree in Biology, Zoology, Ecology or a related sub-
ject, preferably with some ﬁeld experience.
Essential qualities: The successful applicant will be ﬁt,
hard-working and meticulous, and have sharp eyes. He
or she will be capable of working independently and
looking after him or herself, as much of the work will
be unsupervised. Be aware that we will be working
under lonely conditions over Christmas and the New
Year. Most importantly, a positive attitude and sense
of humour are essential!
Desirable qualities: Bird handling/ringing experience
is a bonus, as is the ability drive 4 x 4 with manual
gearshift.
Expenses in the Falklands (including food, accommo-
dation and transport) will be covered, but the applicant
must be prepared to pay their own way to the Falkland
Islands.
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE MAIL OR
EMAIL YOUR CV AND 2 LETTERS OF RECOM-
MENDATION. Applications will close on 10th Septem-
ber 2007.

SouthAfrica VolunteerFieldAssist
Volunteer needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
August/September to November 2007>From November 2007 onwards
We have one vacant position for a volunteer as ﬁeld as-
sistant at our project in South Africa. The volunteer
could start immediately or August / September and
should stay until the end of the year.
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Whereas the research is
mainly non-invasive, this is no job for extreme animal
right persons (we take tissue and blood samples). Hard
working conditions will await applicants, as the study
species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock),
and stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
ﬁeld will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for the masters’ studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
500 (around 70 Euro) must be paid for accommodation
at the research station. Students must buy their own
food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 1500 or 200
Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect to
pay about 300 Euros per month. Students get an invi-
tation letter which they can use to apply for funding in
their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW in
Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (JuneAugust 1, 2007 EvolDir 33
to September).
When and how long: Currently we are looking for a vol-
unteer for the period July/August to October/ Novem-
ber 2007, the breeding season. The next open positions
will be December 2007 and January 2008.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch and cc to

UQueensland TelomereEvol
Queensland Government & the University of Queens-
land
Brisbane, Australia
Queensland Department of Primary Industries invests
$100m pa in world-class basic and applied scientiﬁc re-
search. Research in the Sustainable Fisheries Unit is
focussed on providing new information about commer-
cially exploited ﬁsheries and by-catch species to im-
prove the accuracy of mathematical models used to set
catch limits. Within this brief, the Molecular Fisheries
Laboratory (MFL) provides information such as genetic38 EvolDir August 1, 2007
population structure, eﬀective size and individual iden-
tiﬁcation using the most recent advances in molecular
and population genetics.
The laboratory is embarking on an ambitious new area
of work to use telomeric DNA as a marker for indi-
vidual age in a range of ﬁsheries species. This will in-
volve transferring scientiﬁc knowledge from the ﬁeld of
human cancer research, where telomeres are a signiﬁ-
cant research target, to non-model organisms such as
lobsters, crabs and prawns. The ages of individuals
of these species in the wild, and hence their growth,
is poorly known. Individual growth is critically impor-
tant in determining the optimal proportion of a resource
that can be removed on a sustainable basis. Sustainable
exploitation of ﬁsheries resources is essential to ensure
the future of the commercial and recreational ﬁshing
industry that is worth about $600 million pa to the
Queensland economy.
MFL is searching for a molecular geneticist (full-time,
initially for one year, $59,564 to 65,046 pa) and a post-
graduate student (stipend $22,000 pa) to work on this
project. Ideally you will have a background or interest
in telomeric DNA and cell biology. The student will
complete an MSc or PhD at the University of Queens-
land and be co-supervised by Dr Melissa Brown (School
of Molecular and Microbial Sciences).

Field assistants /volunteers to study evolution of group
living in House SparrowsFor ca. 3.5 months - from the end of November 2007
until before Xmas and from January 2008 until mid
March 2008.
I seek two highly motivated ﬁeld assistants/volunteers
to help me with ﬁeldwork. The study site is located
in the foothills of the Pyrenees in southern France. My
project aims at investigating group living and group de-
cisions in house sparrows. The project is in its start-up
phase and requires extensive banding of birds. Banding
experience and familiarity of handling birds are thus a
merit. Field assistants are expected to be able to work
independent and willing to take responsibility. The ﬁeld
work will comprise catching and banding birds, survey-
ing movements of groups and assist with simple exper-
iments in the ﬁeld. Work will cover 5 days per week.
Drivers licence at least for one of the assistants required.
Basic knowledge of French or Basque language will fa-
cilitate work in the ﬁeld since we will frequently interact
with the locals to catch birds at roosts in gardens and
around farm houses.
The study site is located close to the Pyrenees (ca. 15
km oﬀ St. Jean Pied du Port) in a small valley which is
unaﬀected by tourism and is an excellent wildlife spot
on one of the major European bird migration routes.
The study site is within an hour’s drive of the airports
of Biarritz and Pau (both served by Ryanair).
Qualiﬁcations: 1) Bachelors degree in biology or similar
qualiﬁcation 2) Sociable personality and motivated 3)
Willing to work outside 5 days per week. The climate at
the study site during winter is mild and snow fall rarely.
4) Drivers licence (at least one of the assistants) 5) Used
to handle animals, bird banding experience would be a
plus.
The project will cover transport to and within study
site, accommodation and food. Assistants with exten-
sive bird banding or ﬁeld work experience will be paid
a salary of 500 per month.

AminoAcid coordinates
Hi everyone,
I was wondering how one would go about obtaining the
3D coordinates of amino acid residues in proteins from
.pdb ﬁles? I’ve examined the FAQ ﬁle about the .pdb
ﬁle format, but it isn’t entirely clear (at least not to
me) how to determine the 3D positions of each of the
atoms. I think I understand how the data is stored, but
I’m not sure.
Thanks, Brad Davis
davis@zoology.ubc.caAminoAcid coordinates answers
Hi everyone,
Thanks for the all the replies I got- they were very help-
ful and they conﬁrmed my suspicions. Anyway, in order
to pass on the information acquired:
Some book chapters were given as suggested readings:
Chapter 11 of Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics By
James Tisdall (I’ll almost certainly be getting this).
It was also said that obtaining the desired data isn’t
easy, because the .pdb format was written in the days
of FORTRAN. The .pdb ﬁle format speciﬁes the con-
tents of ﬁles by the contents of speciﬁc column numbers,
rather than by ﬁeld.
It was also suggested that depending on what I wanted
to do, I might consider using another database such as
MMDB or CATH/SCOP.

EST library question
Dear EvolDir members,
I am looking for information about costs of develop-
ing expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries in the USA
(California).
I would appreciate information on how much it would
cost to: i) produce one or three-four libraries and ii)
sequence 5000-10000 clones.
Have any of you had this work ordered from a company?
What is the price for that? What kind of data would
a company normally provide (libraries, sequences, or
assemblies into unigenes)? Can you recommend any
companies to do this?
Alternatively, how much time and money is required to
do all the work yourself, with one human-power? Can
you recommend any kits to use?
I appreciate any tips on whether you found it more eﬃ-
cient to produce one library and sequence more clones,
or sequences fewer clones from several libraries pro-
duced from diﬀerent tissues. Did you ﬁnd the normal-
ization step to be useful (worth the increased costs)?
I will post replies to EvolDir.
Thanks a lot Asta

Freeze-drying lyophilizing
PlantTissue
Hello I would appreciate advice on how to freeze-dry
(lyophilize) plant tissue samples for maximum preser-
vation of DNA quality when storing the freeze-dried
samples at room temp. We currently use a Labconco
Lyophilizer and freeze-dry the prefrozen (at -80C) leaf
samples in batch mode in coin envelopes or plastic tubes
at about -10C shelf temp and -40C collector temp. for
3 to 7 days and store them sealed with a desiccant at
room temp. There are problems with DNA degrada-
tion especially in the tube-dried samples (desiccant is
outside the small tubes). I recently read about the need
for secondary drying at a temperature higher than am-
bient and a time 1/3 to 1/2 that required for primary
drying. What in your estimation is a safe shelf tem-
perature for secondary drying and a safe duration? Do
you think that our primary freeze-drying conditions are
optimal- or at least good enough? If you have a really
good, tested freeze-drying (Lyophilizing) protocol for
plant tissue samples or any other related helpful advise
I’d much appreciate a note from you.

Genesamp help
Hi all.
I’ve been having some problems running Genesamp.
When I try to open the program, a black window opens
and then closes itself automatically, along with an error
sound. I tried to run it using the Run function in the
Start menu (Windows XP) but the same thing ocurred.I tried to run it directly from MS-DOS but that didn’t
work either. I’ve changed computers (though not op-
erating systems) and have still encountered the same
problem. I was wondering if maybe some of you had
faced a similar situation and/or had an idea how to
solve the problem.
Thanks in advance.

META-ANALYSIS SEEKING DATA ON GROUP
SIZE AND PARASITISM
A National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent:
www.nescent.org ) working group is exploring ways to
enhance meta-analyses and syntheses through broader
requests for data. Here, we present one pilot request
for data for a proposed synthetic work. Charles Nunn
and Laszlo Garamszegi seek unpublished results and
“pointers” to published results involving the associa-
tion between group size and parasitism in vertebrates.
The data will be used in a meta-analysis to investigate
the links between sociality and parasitism. All pub-
lished studies will be cited in resultant publications, and
unpublished work may be given credit through consor-
tium coauthorship for the person providing the data.
For more information, please see:

InsectPreservation DNAanalysis
Dear colleagues,
A recurrent query, I know, so my regrets to be resur-
recting it again:
I am seeking convenient methods for storing insect sam-
ples (ants) for future DNA analysis (microsatellite DNA
analysis - and if possible ideally also sequencing of a few
MtDNA genes). Ethanol is ﬁne except that one cannot
take it along on plane journeys, and when sending backsamples one has to send them as dangerous goods. A
colleague sent me a guide from the Australian Museum
on preservation methods, and I noticed that they sug-
gested 15% trehalose. Would any of you have experi-
ence on using this for insects (what volumes?) and am-
plifying microsatellites from insects preserved in that
manner? It seems one has to dry the samples after a
24hs bath in trehalose, which would be diﬃcult to do in
the ﬁeld; also, trehalose may not penetrate well through
an exo-skeleton.
Alternatively, do any of you have experience with us-
ing triple-distilled vodka (e.g. Balkan 176 which claims
to be 88%; or the less strong ones of 40-50%) or other
strong alcoholic beverages, which the Austr. Museum
guide also suggests? Using such might still give prob-
lems when shipping the most ﬂammable ones, but at
least one could conveniently buy it in airports.
Other suggestions would equally be welcome.
Thank you much in advance for ideas and expe-
riences. Please send replies directly to me at :

Origin of gametologs
Gametologs? The August issue of Trends in Ecology
and Evolution refers to the sex chromosomes as “game-
tologs:”
“We now know that the neognathous sex chromosomes
follow the general pattern of sex chromosome evolution,
with the initial cessation of recombination between the
proto-sex chromosomes that is extended in a stepwise
fashion along most of the length of the gametologs (the
two diﬀerent sex chromosomes), eventually leading to
divergence into recognizable Z and W chromosomes.”
Can anyone explain the origin, and rationale, of this
term?

Reconstructing Evolution: New Mathematical and
Computational Advances Olivier Gascuel & Mike Steel
(eds), Oxford University Press, July 2007 http://-
www.lirmm.fr/˜gascuel/MAAS/NEWOUP-Book.html
Since the pioneering work in phylogenetics in the 1960s,
models have become increasingly sophisticated to ac-
count for the inherent complexity of evolution. They
rely heavily on mathematics and aim at modelling and
analyzing biological phenomena such as horizontal gene
transfer, heterogeneity of mutation, and speciation and
extinction processes. This book presents these recent
models, their biological relevance, their mathematical
basis, their properties, and the algorithms to infer them
from data. A number of subﬁelds from mathemat-
ics and computer science are involved: combinatorics,
graph theory, stringology, probabilistic and Markov
models, information theory, statistical inference, Monte
Carlo methods, continuous and discrete algorithmics.
This book arises from the Mathematics of Evolution
& Phylogeneticsmeeting at the Mathematical Institute
Henri Poincar´ e, Paris, in June 2005 and is based on
the state-of-the-art reports presented by the keynote
speakers. Ten chaptersbased around ﬁve themesprovide
a detailed overview of key topics, from the underlying
concepts to the latest results, some of which are at the
forefront of current research.

Software Mol coanc
Dear Evoldir members,
Version 2.0 of the software MOL COANC is ready to
be downloaded from the site
<http://www.uvigo.es/webs/c03/webc03/-
XENETICA/XB2/Jesus/Fernandez.htm > http://-
www.uvigo.es/webs/c03/webc03/XENETICA/XB2/-
Jesus/Fernandez.htm This software allows for the
estimation of coancestry coeﬃcients between a group
of individuals based on their molecular information,
following the approach of Fern¨ ı¿1
2ndez & Toro (2006,
Molecular Ecology). New features include the possi-
bility of introducing a partially know genealogy, thus,
the program will force the solution to ﬁt with this
predeﬁned structure. For example: if we know that
a group of individuals are FS, all of them will share
both parents irrespective if the algorithm adds other
members to the group. Another common situation
is knowing at least the mother for all individuals in
species where seeds or eggs are laid together.
Another improvement is the possibility of setting a
¨ ı¿1
2tolerance’ parameter, deﬁned as the number of loci
where we allows for Mendelian incompatibilities when
forming FS groups. This way we can cope with geno-
typing errors avoiding the inclusion of an individual in
its correct FS group.
A bug has been also ﬁxed. Previous version assumed
that order of alleles in heterozygotes was always the
same (i. e. always the ¨ ı¿1
2smaller’ ﬁrst). If not, errors
in the FS compatibility checking could occur. Present
version admits any order for the genotypes.

StadenPackage question
Dear All,
I am interested to know your opinions about the free
sequence editing programme STADEN. In particular I
would like to know whether every set of forward and re-
verse sequence per sample, have to be treated extra in
pregap and gap, or whether there is a way of applying
the same settings in pregap to a whole lot of sequences
and then edit the F and R contigs separately. I tried
and it seemed less useful, e.g. in pregap you have to
individually click to accept every single ﬁle, e.g. click
96 times for a whole seq plate.
Any comments, advice?

StadenPackage question answer
Hi Saskia, in response to your query re Staden.
Depending on what you are doing, you
might ﬁnd programs like STARS ( http://-
neelix.molbiol.ox.ac.uk:8080/userweb/mchan/stars/ )
or the recently developed PHINEUS ( http://-
www.phineus.org/ ) useful. Both of these are designed
with repetitive sequencing projects in mind, such as
Multilocus sequence typing, or sequencing the same
locus in many samples. STARS uses a STADEN
environment, whereas PHINEUS stands alone, with
the exception of needing Phred. Both do what you
ask, which is to apply the same pregap (or equivalent)
settings to a large number of dataﬁles. This includes
clipping to the start and end points of a predeﬁned
allele. They then identify the F and R reads, match
them up and produce a consensus. This may then be
used to interrogate online databases.
Hope this helps
Best

StatPackAnalysisMixtures sofware
question
Hello,
I am working with databases to analyse a mixed-stock
ﬁshery, so I’m trying to use StatPackAnalysisMixtures
software for the analysis. I use 13 microsatellites of
between 14 and 56 alleles. To date, I have prepared
a control ﬁle for a simulation, but when using all 13
microsatellites, there is always that error message ?All
mixture genotypes are impossible. Reduce genotype
tolerance parameter? even if I set the GPA at 100, and
the other two tolerance criteria at 0. When I conserve
only the 6 less polymorphic loci, the simulation runs. I
tried to use more loci and it works until 9 loci, but the
estimates are getting worse with more loci. I know it is
supposed to work with more loci since a lot of papers
used StatPackAnalysisMixtures in similar conditions as
me. If you have any suggestions to help me, I would
appreciate it !

Undergrad genetics software
Hello-
We’re currently working to update our undergraduate
genetics computer lab. We currently use two programs
Dos Genetics (Schmidel, 1995) and Virtual Genetics
(Day, U of Western Ontario) in our labs. We’re look-
ing for computer-based (preferably Mac, though we can
also use PC programs) genetics labs that cover basic
Medelian genetics and patterns of inheritance (dihybrid
crosses, sex-linked genes, etc.) as well as some molec-
ular genetics topics (such as lac operon problems, and
deletion mapping). I’m curious what software other
schools are using and what they recommend. Any sug-
gestions would be greatly appreciated.

project description :
Invasion of a virulent mutant in a background of a resi-
dent strain. [keywords : Epidemiology ; Crop resistance
management ; Stochastic model ; Spatial structure] Re-
sistance to pathogens in cultivated plants is largely de-
termined by monogenic resistance factors. In most sit-
uations, these resistance factors are overcome by the
pathogen within a few years. Large research eﬀorts are
currently developed to extend the durability of plant re-
sistance to diseases, either by introducing original com-
binations of resistance factors in new varieties or by
developing crop management strategies to preserve the
eﬃcacy of the newly deployed resistance genes. Pre-
diction of resistance durability is largely based on mu-
tation rates (mutation from avirulent to virulent) and
ﬁtness costs (detrimental eﬀect of this mutation to the
pathogen ﬁtness). However, a rapid examination of
published data on mutation rates and population sizes
suggest that any new resistance gene should be over-
come instantly after its introduction in a crop. Yet
durability of resistance is reported to be in the order of
years to decades. The objective of the post-doc project
will be to test a sequence of hypotheses that might ex-
plain why durability is not well predicted by the basic
information on mutation rate and virulence cost. Par-
ticularly, the eﬀect of the local spatial structure of the52 EvolDir August 1, 2007
system will be examined, as well as the consequences of
demographic stochasticity.
To test these hypotheses, a stochastic model for the in-
vasion of a mutant in a background of a resident strain
will be developed and analyzed.
The project will be largely based on data sets collected
and analyzed by the Epidemiology group of BIOGER
and describing wheat leaf rust (Puccinia triticina, a
fungal pathogen of wheat) epidemiology : spore pro-
duction (Rime D. et al. 2005. Plant Pathology 54:287-

273 ; Goyeau H. et al. 2007. Fungal Genetics and
Biology 44:474-483).
The Epidemiology group, BIOGER, INRA Grignon,
develops research on fungal disease epidemiology and
host resistance management. Re-introducing functional
biodiversity in crops for resistance characters provides
an ecological approach to disease control and could con-
tribute to the sustainability of crop production. The
project will be developed in collaboration with Frank
Van den Bosch, Rothamsted Research (UK), leader
of the Population dynamics and evolutionary ecology
group. The central theme of this group is the devel-
opment and application of parsimonious, generic mod-
els to study the population dynamics and evolutionary

A postdoctoral research associate is sought for a 3-year
NERC-funded post to develop a synthetic overview of
macroevolution in planktonic foraminifera over the last
65 million years. Planktonic foraminifera have an un-
paralleled fossil record, providing the clearest available
view of species dynamics over a long time scale, en-
abling us to produce the most comprehensive picture
available of the large-scale evolutionary history of any
group over a prolonged period. The job involves ap-
plying a range of statistical approaches (e.g., survival
analysis, phylogenetically independent contrasts, time
series analysis) to the fossil history of the group, devel-
oping necessary software in the statistical computing
language R, and writing papers.

PopulationDynamics
Post-doctoral position investigating individual diﬀer-
ences and the dynamics of animal populations
Applications are invited for a 3-year, post-doctoral po-
sition funded by the Natural Environment Research
Council. The post holder will investigate the feedback
between the dynamics of phenotypic traits and popu-
lations using long-term observational data from Soaysheep, silvereyes and meerkats, and experimental data
from manipulations of soil mite populations.
A key step in understanding evolutionary change in
stochastic environments is to understand links be-
tween changes in the distribution of heritable pheno-
typic traits and changes in the dynamics of populations
caused by ﬂuctuations in birth and death rates. In our
recent research we have demonstrated how evolution-
ary change can inﬂuence the dynamics of populations,
and how ecological variation can inﬂuence the strength
and direction of selection, as well as the demographic
rate via which selection operates most strongly. The
post-doc will extend this research and will conduct sta-
tistical analyses of existing data, the construction of
population models and the development of new theory.
The ideal applicant will have, or will be about to com-
plete, a Ph.D., as well as a strong quantitative back-
ground and an interest in ecological and evolutionary
processes.
The post-doc will be based at Imperial College’s Sil-
wood Park Campus in Tim Coulson’s group, but the
project will involve close collaboration with Tim Ben-
ton in Leeds, Tim Clutton-Brock in Cambridge, Shri-
pad Tuljapurkar in Stanford, and Ian Owens also at
Imperial College London.
The post will start on October 1st 2007 and will run
for three years. The salary will be in the range £23850
-£34750. Applicants should send a cover letter, appli-
cation form and an up-to-date copy of their CV to Tim
Coulson (t.coulson@imperial.ac.uk) by July 31st 2007.

POSITION:
Post-doctoral fellowship in the Section on Genomic
Structure & Function, Laboratory of Molecular &
Cell Biology, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda MD 20892 USA
AVAILABILITY: Autumn, 2007
TOPIC:
Experimental analysis of evolutionary inferences: the
interaction between the mammalian L1 (LINE-1) retro-
transposon and its host.
SUMMARY:
L1 elements have been replicating and evolving in mam-
mals since 70 million years ago. During this time novel
L1 families repeatedly arose, only to go extinct coinci-
dent with the emergence of another novel L1 family.
This process has persisted to the present and generally
resulted in a single evolutionary lineage of L1 families.
The repeated emergence of successful L1 families has
occurred despite the fact that they are deleterious to
their host.
The pattern of mammalian L1 evolution resembles that
of the inﬂuenza virus HA antigen in humans. The lat-
ter is explained by the successive emergence of viral
variants that bypass existing host defenses (immunity)
followed by the reestablishment of host immunity. We
suggest that an analogous adversarial interaction be-
tween L1 and its host explains the pattern of L1 evolu-
tion.
Projects that examine the interaction of L1 and its host:
- Analysis of the host factors that interact with regions56 EvolDir August 1, 2007
of L1 that have been either highly conserved or under-
gone adaptive evolution.
- Analysis of the structural and functional consequences
of adaptive changes undergone by L1 encoded proteins.
Also ongoing are projects that use L1 DNA “fossils”
generated by now extinct L1 families to examine the
history and architecture of the mammalian genome.

genes have been identiﬁed from genetic and microar-
ray analyses. With the powerful genetic tools and ge-
nomics resources available in D. melanogaster, we will1). validate the expression diﬀerence between species
and their hybrids, 2). study the functional diﬀerences
by molecular genetic approaches and 3) analyze the evo-
lutionary process of genes evolving in species diﬀeren-
tiation. Our work addresses a fundamental question
in evolutionary biology and will provide an opportu-
nity for the candidate to build a career in this area.

“Postdoctoral Research Assistant: Application of
the Bumblebee Foraging Pheromone for Commercial
Greenhouse Pollination
Ref: 07269/KR
Salary: £30,066 - £33,513 per annum
This full-time, 12 month ﬁxed term post is funded
through a NERC grant awarded to Professor Lars Chit-
tka, Dr Nigel Raine (Queen Mary, University of Lon-
don) and Dr Juliet Osborne (Rothamsted Research).
The aim of the project is to ﬁnd the optimum blend
of foraging recruitment pheromones to encourage and
maintain high levels of foraging behaviour in bumble-
bee colonies, and to test its eﬃcacy at increasing crop
yield of a commercially important crop (tomatoes) in
greenhouse conditions.
The post holder will carry out behavioural experi-
ments to assess the eﬃcacy of diﬀerent combinations
and dosages regimes of artiﬁcial foraging recruitment
pheromone components on the foraging activity of bum-blebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies in the laboratory at
Queen Mary, University of London. The potential eﬀect
of the optimum pheromone blend on pollination levels
and crop yield of tomatoes will be tested in greenhouses
at Rothamsted Research in an experiment lasting sev-
eral months. During the project the post holder will
need to work ﬂexibly at both institutions as necessary.
Having established the artiﬁcial foraging recruitment
pheromone eﬀectively mimics the natural bumblebee
system to communicate the presence of food outside
the nest, the post holder will develop a cost-eﬀective
automatic system to dispense pheromone. To increase
general applicability of this innovative technology, the
post holder will be involved in determining the recruit-
ment pheromone components of a second bumblebee
species.
Applicants should possess a PhD ideally in the area of
invertebrate behavioural ecology, physiology or evolu-
tionary biology. Working knowledge of pollination ecol-
ogy and/ or pheromone chemistry would be desirable.

the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology
at the University of California, Riverside. The focus
of the research is to investigate the population biology
of Pyricularia grisea, causal agent of gray leaf spot of
turf and rice blast. This work is currently in progress,
therefore, a qualiﬁed candidate would have the oppor-
tunity to immediately begin collecting genotypic data
using AFLP and/or microsatellite markers from sam-
pled populations. DNA has been extracted from a
large collection of isolates and mating type data has
already been collected. This could prove to be a fruit-
ful position for an ambitious candidate since there could
be many additional research opportunities to work on
other projects within the two labs.
Candidates should have a Ph.D. degree in plant pathol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics/computational
biology, or related disciplines. Proven ability to pub-
lish is highly desirable. Good analytical skills within
population genetics and/or systematics are expected.

essential but is desirable.
The start date is ﬂexible but the position can be imme-
diately ﬁlled. The position has guaranteed funding for
one year with a high likelihood of multi-year extension
of funding. Salary is commensurate with experience
and qualiﬁcations, with a minimum of $32,000/year.

A postdoctoral position examining the evolution of
mating systems is available in the laboratory of Dr. Ken
Fedorka, Department of Biology, University of Central
Florida.
Project title: Sex-speciﬁc ﬁtness consequences of the
female immune response to insemination in Drosophila
melanogaster.
Project summary: In many systems, females exhibit a
strong, localized immune response to the male ejaculate
that has been noted to kill sperm. Under conditions
of sperm competition, males may evolve the capacity
to interfere with the female immune response in order
to increase sperm viability, and hence fertilization suc-
cess. To address this possibility, the project will manip-
ulate genes that code for female immune proteins and
male ejaculate proteins in order to elucidate their po-
tential eﬀect on mating behavior, sperm viability and
sperm competition. For more information regarding the
project, my lab or the University of Central Florida,
please contact me (fedorka@mail.ucf.edu) or visit
http://biology.ucf.edu/˜fedorka/lab The postdoctoral
position can be ﬁlled immediately (8/1/2007) and will
remain open until a suitable candidate is found. The
position will be funded for two years ($36,000 /year),
with a possible third year contingent upon ﬁnancial
support and favorable performance. Experience with
Drosophila, real-time rt-PCR and RNAi preferred, but
not required. Knowledge and/or a strong desire to

Recent insights from evolutionary biology into the
study of cancer reveal much about genes that increase
cancer risk. For example, evolutionary biology can ex-
plain why cancer is so prevalent and why endogenous
and clinical anti-cancer mechanisms are often ineﬃ-
cient. Many genes that increase cancer risk are posi-
tively selected and there is evidence that much of this
rapid evolution is fuelled by genetic conﬂicts of inter-
est. Such conﬂicts arise when interacting parties have
diﬀerent interests and they can be potent drivers of evo-
lutionary change. In this research project we will test
for signiﬁcant associations between cancer-predisposing
genes, positive selection and genetic conﬂicts. The
project will use surveys of published data, bioinformatic
and meta-analyses, and will extend into the power-
ful, experimental domain by using gene expression mi-

A postdoc position in molecular evolutionary biology is
available in the lab of Axel Meyer in the Department of
Biology at the University of Konstanz in Germany. The
evolutionary biology group is an international group of
students and postdocs that also includes the labs of
Gerrit Begemann on zebraﬁsh developmental genetics
and Shigehiro Kuraku on evolutionary developmental
biology. The main language spoken in the lab is En-
glish.
We are looking for an energetic postdoc who is inter-
ested in speciation, molecular evolution, bioinformat-
ics/genomics, or evolutionary developmental biology.
The speciﬁc research projects we are recruiting for in-
volve (1) research on phylogenetics and population ge-
netics of cichlid ﬁshes (2) as well as the discovery and
functional characterization of (e.g. coloration) genes
underlying the diversiﬁcation of cichlid ﬁsh in Africa
and in Nicaragua.
The great lakes in East Africa house some of the world’s
most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Lakes Victoria,
Malawi and Tanganyika are particularly well-knownAugust 1, 2007 EvolDir 63
for their adaptive radiations of hundreds of endemic
species of cichlid ﬁshes. We are interested in under-
standing speciation, phylogeography, molecular evolu-
tion and molecular phylogenetics of these cichlid ﬁsh
assemblages. Also, we wish to identify and charac-
terize the function of genes that are involved in the
phenotypic diversiﬁcation and presumably speciation
of cichlid ﬁshes. Several molecular biological, “devo-
evo” and genomic approaches, including candidate gene
approaches, DNA-chip technology, characterization of
ESTs, in situ hybridization in cichlids and transgenics
in zebraﬁsh are used to address these questions. We
are also interested in evolutionary genomic questions
and the evolution of novel gene functions after gene
and genome duplications.
Some recent publications of the lab include: Verheyen
et al. (2003). The origin of the superﬂock of cichlid
ﬁshes from Lake Victoria, East Africa. Science 300:
325-329. Salzburger et al. (2005). Out of Tanganyika:

Postdoc salaries are approximately 45-50,000 Euros an-
nually, (depending on marital status, age, etc.) before
deductions for taxes, health insurance and retirement
contributions.
The position is open immediately. The review of appli-
cants will begin immediately until the position is ﬁlled.

the widespread existence of social traits in microbes re-
mains a challenge for evolutionary biology, yet the role
of ecology has traditionally been overlooked. Recent
work by our lab suggests that ecology is likely to play
a crucial role by mediating both relatedness and the
costs / beneﬁts of cooperation (see Brockhurst, Buck-

The postdoctoral fellow will be mainly located in the
ﬁrst laboratory (in Orsay, near Paris), but will be in
strong interaction with the people from the two other
laboratories in Avignon and Bordeaux. The position
requires solid experience in computer science (in par-
ticular C programming), as well as in population and
quantitative genetics. All candidates should then a mo-
tivation letter, a CV and the name and email of three
references by email to Frederic Austerlitz before August
15th. Do not hesitate also to contact him in case more
details are needed.
The aim of the postdoctoral work would be to develop
models that account for changes in environmental con-
ditions through time. To this extent, populations or
metapopulations of individuals will be simulated. The
individuals will be characterized by their phenotype for
several adaptive traits, these traits being coded by sev-
eral loci. The model will consider diﬀerent possibili-
ties for the relation between genotypes and phenotypes,
including the possibility of pleitropy (involvement of
a given gene in several traits). Diﬀerent scenarios of
climatic changes will be considered by allowing diﬀer-
ent model parameters to vary for one or several of the
adaptive traits (e.g. variation of the optimal pheno-
type across time, for diﬀerent intensities and time steps)
or the quality of the environment. The impact of the
diﬀerent scenarios of climatic changes retained will be
assessed on both phenotypic and genetic responses of
populations.
The study will focus both on a local scale using
the spatially-explicit individual-based software CAP-
SIS (Dreyfus et al., 2005) and a larger scale using
the software METAPOP (Le Corre et al., 1997 ; Le
Corre et Kremer, 2003) that considers panmictic pop-
ulations connected by gene ﬂow. Regarding the global
scale, while the basic simulation framework is already
implemented in METAPOP, the postdoctoral fellowwill have to modify the source code in order to deal
speciﬁcally with the questions addressed here, namely
the implementation of scenarios of changes across time
and the possibility to model several traits simultane-
ously. He/she will then be able to compare the re-
sults of METAPOP with the results of simulations per-
formed at the local scale with CAPSIS, in which the
expression of a phenotypic trait, and thus the relation
between phenotype and ﬁtness depends explicitly on
spatial position of individuals through a demographic
model. This demographic model describes explicitly
how an individual with a given genotype in a given
environment will survive, reproduce or disperse. The
postdoctoral fellow will not be directly involved in the
modiﬁcation of the source code of CAPSIS but he/she
will participate in the methodological choices of how in-
troducing directional variation of the environment qual-
ity, and in the analyses of the simulations performed
with this software.
The parameters of the simulations (e.g. seed and pollen
dispersal curves, number of loci involved in the traits,
quality of the environment ) will be calibrated with data
from the intensive study sites (ISS) of EVOLTREE and
from the literature.

Course of Phylogeny and Evolution using Bioinformat-
ics
http://www.ch.embnet.org/CoursEMBnet/-
PagesPHYL07/Introduction.html September 03 -
07, 2007, Lausanne, Switzerland
This course is organized for PhD students from Switzer-
land and abroad.
The goal of this course is to learn to build and inter-
pret phylogenetic trees from sequence data, whether to
study species evolution or to study gene and genome
evolution. This includes proper use of the main soft-
ware, reading trees to infer relevant conclusions, and
downstream analysis of evolutionary patterns. During
the course, the students will be encouraged to analyse
their own data.
The course is held in a one-week session, and requires
full-time attendance. Students will be credited 2 ECTS
if needed for their PhD program. Lodgings and meals
are organized for students unable to commute from
their places of residence. A registration fee of CHF
100.- is asked to all participants before the beginning
of the course.
We will use EMBnet funds to give limited support to
participants from outside Western Switzerland.
Speakers: * Nicolas Galtier, Institut des sciences
de l’evolution de Montpellier, CNRS, France * Marc

tion, University of Lausanne & Swiss Institute of Bioin-
formatics * Nicolas Salamin, Department of Ecology

EXTENDING THE DARWINIAN FRAMEWORK,

Associated with ECAL 2007.

UPDATE: 3rd July 2007
* Paper Submission Closed * Call for Ab-
stracts/Participation *
Submission of papers and oral presentations is now
closed. However, we will continue to accept abstracts
for poster presentations. We expect to announce ad-
ditional invited speakers in the very near future, and
hope to encourage researchers interested in all areas of
evolutionary theory to attend this exciting workshop.
****
This workshop will explore the formation of new lev-
els of selection and inheritance, the origin of the ﬁrst
evolutionary units and novel modes of natural selec-
tion. Recent work in a variety of ﬁelds has presented a
challenge to standard gene-centric evolutionary theory.
Higher-level and non-genetic sources of heredity have
been discovered. Artiﬁcial selection experiments have
demonstrated a response to selection of whole microbial
ecosystems, with concomitant implications for the for-
mation of new evolutionary units. These results bear
important relation to long-standing questions regarding
the formation of new levels of biological organisation.
The debate over levels of selection has an extended his-
tory. However, given recent empirical results and out-
standing unresolved issues, it again seems pertinent to
ask: What can selection act on? What sources of her-itable variation exist? How can selection bring about
new units of selection? And how can artiﬁcial life mod-
els help to answer such questions?
Areas of interest:
Major transitions in evolution, formation of new
units of selection and/or levels of inheritance, non-
genetic heredity/epigenetics, evolution of co-operation,
ecosystem selection, multi-level selection theory, niche
construction and extended heredity, origins of life,
homeostasis and heredity/levels of homeostasis, self-
organisation and formation of new levels of selec-
tion and heredity, development and selection, disam-
biguating co-evolution and higher-level selection, co-
evolutionary transitions in life and the environment,...

Beyond BLAST and FASTA - Alignment: from pro-
teins to genomes - This course presents a comprehen-
sive overview of the theory and practice of computa-
tional methods for extracting the maximum amount of
information from protein and DNA sequence similarity
through sequence database searches, statistical analy-
sis, and multiple sequence alignment, and genome scale
alignment. Additional topics include gene ﬁnding, den-
tifying signals in unaligned sequences, integration of ge-
netic and sequence information in biological databases.August 1, 2007 EvolDir 73
The course combines lectures with hands-on exercises;
students are encouraged to pose challenging sequence
analysis problems using their own data. The course
makes extensive use of local WWW pages to present
problem sets and the computing tools to solve them.
Students use Windows and Mac workstations attached
to a UNIX server.
The course is designed for biologists seeking advanced
training in biological sequence analysis, computational
biology core resource directors and staﬀ, and for scien-
tists in other disciplines, such as computer science, who
wish to survey current research problems in biological
sequence analysis and comparative genomics.
The primary focus of the Computational and Compar-ative Genomics Course is the theory and practice of al-
gorithms used in computational biology, with the goal
of using current methods more eﬀectively and develop-
ing new algorithms. Cold Spring Harbor also oﬀers a
“Programming for Biology” course, which focuses more
on software development.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although74 EvolDir August 1, 2007
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
