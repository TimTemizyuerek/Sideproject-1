Dear Sir/Madam
We are the members of Biology and Genetic Student
Club in Middle East Technical University (METU) at
Ankara/Turkey.
We will organize 1st International Student Congress
of Evolutionary Biology. We decided to organize this
congress because of lack of an Evolutionary Biology
Congress for students and also increasing attacks of
fundamentalist and ignored opponents of the evolution.
We want to sharing of information about Evolutionary
Biology between the students comes from all over the
world. Also want to show, young people adopt the The-
ory of Evolution.
Congress will be held on 29-30 September, 1 October
2012 at METU. It will include 6 sessions. One of them
consist presentations of academicians on “View of the
Theory of Evolution in Turkey and World”. Other 5
session include BSs, MSc and PhD students’ presen-
tations and academicians moderate the sessions (total
20 oral presentations also poster presentations). Also
2 plenary talks will take place in congress. Prof. Eva
Jablonka from Tel Aviv University accepts to give a
plenary talk. For other talk, we contact to Prof. John
Endler.
Then, we apply for help to you. Even without ﬁnancial
aid, we ask you to other assistance, such as announce-
ment of the congress. Also, recognition of the Congress
and take place under the umbrella of SSE, will be great
honor for us.
If you would like to review, I can send the promoting
ﬁle of Congress.
Sincerely yours...

Friday, April 20 at the Field Museum
www.chicagoplantscience.org The Chicago Plant Sci-
ence Symposium is a one-day meeting intended to high-
light the cutting edge of research in plant evolution,
ecology, and conservation. The program includes lunch
and a post-conference mixer. Best of all, registration is
free!
The theme of the symposium this year is Major Evo-
lutionary Transitions. In their ~450 million years of
evolution, land plants have confronted and overcome
a wide range of challenges, such as dealing with the
environment and interacting with other organisms, ei-
ther competitively or cooperatively. The seven invited
speakers are united by the common thread that their
research investigates some aspect of these major evo-
lutionary transitions or events in the history of land
plants. The talks span evolution, ecology, and paleon-
tology, and include perspectives from molecular, mor-
phological, and functional data.
The speakers this year are:
Jody Banks, Purdue University What a comparison of
the Selaginella genome to others tells us about the early
evolution of plants
Norman Wickett, Chicago Botanic Garden New in-
sights in the evolution of parasitic plants
Nathan Muchhala, University of Nebraska-Lincoln
Bats, birds, and bellﬂowers: the evolution of special-
ized pollination in the Neotropics
Elizabeth Kellogg, University of Missouri-St. Louis The
grass menagerie
Bonnie Jacobs, Southern Methodist University Ceno-
zoic evolution of Africa’s tropical ecosystems6 EvolDir April 1, 2012
Kevin Boyce, University of Chicago What the ﬂowers
did - terrestrial environments and ecology before and
after angiosperm evolution
Thomas Taylor, University of Kansas Fungi as a driving
force in land plant evolution: evidence from the fossil
record
Questions: Contact the co-organizers, Patrick

IST Austria HumanEvolution May7
Registration
The deadline for registration for the upcoming Young
Scientist Symposium on human evolution at IST Aus-
tria is fast approaching!
Human evolution is a topic that lends itself to a variety
of approaches, such as genetics, cognition, the evolu-
tion of language and palaeontology, including extensive
informatic applications. With this symposium we aim
to bring together people from diverse academic back-
grounds and give participants the opportunity to hear
about research that they would perhaps not normally
experience.
We are pleased to announce the following conﬁrmed
speakers: Bence Viola (MPI Leipzig, DE) Bill Sell-
ers (Manchester, UK) E¨ ors Szathm´ ary (Budapest,
HU) Daniel Nettle (Newcastle, UK) Johannes Krause
(T¨ ubingen, DE) (Plus one more TBC)
This one-day event is organised by the students and
postdocs of IST Austria, and will take place on May
7th at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria,
18km North of Vienna. Registration is free and includes
lunch, and a shuttle bus will be provided too and from
Vienna free of charge. There will also be an opportu-
nity for a campus tour if you wish to take a look at the
rest of what goes on at IST Austria.
The deadline for registration is April 5th.
We are especially keen to give scientists at the start of
their career the opportunity to interact with top scien-
tists, and as the day will also include a question and
answer session with the speakers at the end of the day
on the future of human evolution, so that students can
pitch their questions directly to the experts. The event
is aimed at all scientists with an interest in evolutionary
biology, and in particular young scientists are encour-
aged to register!
For more information and to register for this event,please see the following website: http://www.ist.ac.at/-
young-scientist-symposium-2012 Note that registration
is strictly limited to 140 people. Unfortunately as this is
a free event, we are unable to provide funding for travel
for delegates or assist with VISAs or accommodation.

ISBE Post Conference Symposia (August 18 2012) -
stress as evolutionary and behavioral constraints V
where are we now?
Dear EvolDir members,
Like several others before us, we would like to take
the opportunity to advertise a post-conference sym-
posium of this years ISBE meeting in Lund (see
http://www.isbe2012lund.org/ for information about
the meeting).
The symposium stress as evolutionary and behavioral
constraints V where are we now? is one of six post-
conference symposia that will be held on Saturday, 18
August 2012.
The aim of the symposium is to examine the evidence
for and against the role of oxidative stress as behavioral
and evolutionary constraints by bringing together be-
havioral ecologists working on various mechanistic as-
pects. We wish to have a broad taxonomic representa-
tion, and to have organized group meetings and panel
discussions to promote a dialogue between participantsApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 9
from diﬀerent ﬁelds, countries and seniority. The sym-
posium will be divided into three sessions with talks:
development and ageing, immune defence and energet-
ics, and reproduction and behavior, which will build
the basis for group and panel discussions.
The symposium is free of charge but registration is
required for all participants. Participants who wish
to present a 15-minute oral contribution should send
a title and a short abstract to either Michi Tobler
(michael.tobler@biol.lu.se) or Caroline Isaksson (caro-
line.isaksson@biol.lu.se). Registration, more informa-
tion and detailed program will be posted at http://-
www.isbe2012lund.org/post-conference-symposia . We
hope to see you in Lund!

International Behavioural Ecology Congress (“ISBE
2012”) <http://www.isbe2012lund.org/ >that will
take place between August 12 and August 17 2012.
Background:
During the past decade, the ecological theory of adap-
tive speciation and radiation has received considerable
attention. At the core of the ecological theory lies the
idea that incipient species are formed as a direct or in-
direct result of niche-based ecological diﬀerences and
divergent natural selection.
However, more recently non-ecological and non-
adaptive speciation has moved back into the focus of
many researchers, particularly those working on groups
like birds, marine ﬁsh, amphibians and insects. The10 EvolDir April 1, 2012
reason for this shift is that evolutionary diversity in
some groups is less likely to have resulted from diver-
gent ecological selection. Species in these aforemen-
tioned groups are often ecologically similar and show a
high degree of niche conservatism, yet speciation obvi-
ously happens also in these groups of animals.
Behavior might play a crucial role in driving speciation
processes in these groups, including learned mate pref-
erences, sexual selection and sexual conﬂict. The role
of behavior, whether it is through niche conservatism,
mating behaviours or learning, makes the study of non-
ecological and non-adaptive speciation processes espe-
cially interesting for behavioral ecologists. This sympo-
sium intends to foster greater communication between
speciation researchers and behavioral ecologists.

Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce thesymposium organised
at the Mus´ eum National d’Histoire Naturelle
*This international symposium*aims to:
*/1.initiate discussion/*on the concept of constraints
acting at diﬀerent organisational levels. ,
*/2.share and discuss results/*of present and fossil ex-
amples in a comparative framework at molecular, ge-
nomic, developmental, functional, behavioural and eco-
logical levels.
Ideally, the symposium will foster new networks of re-
searchers who will develop interdisciplinary discussions
around new concepts on the origin, development and
evolution of the forms of life.
Any organism is deﬁned by the sum and integration of
the speciﬁc “forms” which it displays at diﬀerent lev-
els of resolution, from the molecular to the ecological.
These forms shape the capacity to generate variation
and to evolve in diﬀerent environments. Understanding
how forms evolve and which constraints regulate these
processes are central questions which remain largely
unanswered. Interdisciplinary discussions between bi-
ologists, physicists, chemists and philosophers will help
develop a new conceptual approach to the notions of“constraints” and evolution of forms. The integration
of this new understanding in a comparative context will
help improve our vision of evolution and adaptation in
a geological timeframe.
This symposium is included into the ATM programme
“/Formes possibles, formes r´ ealis´ ees/” directed by
Pierre-Henri Gouyon and VincentBels from 2009 to
2012 at the *Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle *for
contributing to supporting research on the origin, de-
velopment, function, adaptation and evolution of form

Jul10-11
The Call for Abstracts for full talks is now open for
the 2012 conference on Informatics for Phylogenet-
ics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http:/-
/ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012 . See below
for instructions.
Accepted talks will be 15 minutes in length and will
be presented during the full talk session of the confer-
ence. Because the number of program slots for full talks
is limited, some talks may be moved to the Lightning
Talk session (5 minutes in length).
Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics
aimed at advancing research in phylogenetics, evolu-
tion, and biodiversity, including new tools, cyberinfras-
tructure development, large-scale data analysis, and vi-
sualization.
Submissions should be 1 page long at most and include
a title, a list of contributors, and an abstract. The
abstract should provide an overview of the talk’s sub-
ject, and give enough detail to allow reviewers to decide
whether the submission merits a full talk, or whether
it should be moved to a Lightning Talk session. If the
subject of the talk is a speciﬁc software component for
use by the research community, the abstract must state
the license and give the URL where the source code is
available so reviewers can verify that the open-source
requirement(*) is met.
The deadline for submission is April 2, 2012. We in-
tend to notify authors of accepted talks before early
registration for iEvoBio (and Evolution) ends. Fur-
ther instructions for submission are at the follow-
ing URL: http://ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/-
2012/schedConf/cfp Full talks are one of the ﬁve
kinds of contributed content that feature in iEvoBio.
The other four are: 1) Lightning talks (5 mins long),
2) Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstra-
tions, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. The Call
for Challenge entries is already open (see http://-
ievobio.org/challenge.html ). The calls for contribution
to the other three sessions will open later, and will re-
main open until shortly before the conference or until
the respective track ﬁlls up. In addition, 2012 iEvoBio16 EvolDir April 1, 2012
sponsor Biomatters Ltd will be running the Geneious
Challenge alongside this year’s iEvoBio Challenge, see

Jul10-11 CallForTalks
The Call for Lightning Talks is now open for the 2012
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution,
and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/-ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012 . See below for instruc-
tions.
Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes.
They are ideal for drawing the attention of the audi-
ence to new developments, tools, and resources, or to
subsequent events where more in-depth information can
be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more informa-
tion ( http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning ). Light-
ning talks will be part of the more interactive program
elements on both conference days.
Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics
aimed at advancing research in phylogenetics, evolu-
tion, and biodiversity, including new tools, cyberinfras-
tructure development, large-scale data analysis, and vi-
sualization.
Submissions should be 1 page long at most and include
a title, a list of contributors, and an abstract. The ab-
stract should provide an overview of the talk’s subject.
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within
scope of the conference (see above). If applicable, the
abstract must also state the license and give the URL
where the source code is available so reviewers can ver-
ify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.
Review and acceptance of lightning talks will be on
a rolling basis. The deadline for submission is the
morning of the ﬁrst day of the conference (July 10),
but see below. Further instructions for submission
are at the following URL: http://ievobio.org/ocs2/-
index.php/ievobio/2012/schedConf/cfp Please make
sure to choose the Lightning Talks track for your sub-
mission. Note that the number of lightning talk slots
is ﬁnite and that therefore the track may ﬁll up early.
We cannot accept lightning talks until the open-source
requirements are met, and so waiting with that until
the deadline risks that the track is full by that time.
We ask all submitters of lightning talks to be willing to
also serve as reviewers of such, as described above.
Lightning talks are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1)
Full talks (open until April 2), 2) Challenge entries,
3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of-
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries
remains open (see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html ).
The calls for contribution to the other two sessions
will open later, and will remain open until shortly be-
fore the conference or until the respective track ﬁlls
up. In addition, 2012 iEvoBio sponsor Biomatters

Jul10-11 ChallengeCall
Many trees enter. Fresh analysis ensues. New insights
emerge.
The conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evo-
lution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio) is again holding a
Challenge competition in 2012, on the theme “Synthe-
sizing Phylogenies”. Somewhere, buried in large sets of
trees, lies a stunning new revelation, a baﬄing discov-
ery, the answer to a longstanding controversy, or simply
something not obvious to the naked eye. The mission of
the 2012 iEvoBio challenge is to ﬁnd those revelations,discoveries and answers within your own data and/or
within one of the datasets provided by the challenge.
What new scientiﬁcally interesting results can you pull
from these trees, using any combination of techniques
at your disposal?
Further information on the nature of challenge entries
and how to submit them can be found on the iEvoBio
website at http://ievobio.org/challenge.html . Submis-
sions are due by June 25, 2012. Selected candidates
will make short oral presentations to demonstrate their
work in a “Challenge session” at the conference, and if
suitable will automatically be entered into the Software
Bazaar track of the conference.
Cash prizes will be awarded for ﬁrst place (USD 1,500)
and runner-up entries. The winning entries will be se-
lected by a vote of the iEvoBio meeting participants.
Alongside the iEvoBio Challenge, 2012 iEvoBio spon-
sor Biomatters Ltd is running the Geneious Challenge.
The goal of this challenge is to develop a new plugin
to Geneious Pro, using the public API, that enables a
new and exciting visualization or analysis. The winning
entry will receive a $1000 cash prize, and all entrants
who submit by the deadline will receive a 12-month sub-
scription license. The Geneious Challenge has the same
open and closing dates as the iEvoBio Challenge. See
http://ievobio.org/geneious challenge.html for more in-
formation.
Separate from iEvoBio, the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL)
is leading a Phylogenetic Tree challenge to encourage
not only the development of large phylogenies, but their
practical use. Together with the Global Names project
they will choose two winning entries: one for the best
large tree and one for the most promising but not nec-
essarily large tree – both in Darwin Core Archive for-
mat suitable for use in major biodiversity websites such
as EOL. The two winners will receive paid trips to
the 2012 iEvoBio conference. See http://eol.org/info/-
treechallenge for more information.

Symposium SS42: Neogene global tectonic and climatic
change as drivers in plant evolution: linking the paly-
nological, palaeobotanical and molecular records20 EvolDir April 1, 2012
The Neogene period represents the transition to our
modern world, when crucial geographical features such
as topographic relief, drainage patterns and oceanic
currents were laid out. It also represents the run-up
to the ‘icehouse’ world with ﬁnal bleeps of a ‘green-
house’ during the Middle Miocene (c. 15 Ma) and Mid-
dle Pliocene (c. 4 Ma). The combined eﬀects of global
tectonic and climatic change was critical for ﬂoral and
faunal evolution, but also determined present biodiver-
sity patterns, particularly this latter aspect was only
identiﬁed by scientists in recent years. Interdisciplinary
studies that include the geological history, palynology,
palaeobotany and molecular phylogeny potentially can
oﬀer new insights into our understanding of plant evo-
lution and diversiﬁcation. In this session we encourage
palynologists, palaeobotanists and molecular biologists
who work at the interface of their disciplines to present
their research on the Neogene evolution of plants and
algae in geologically dynamic regions from all over the
globe and from both marine and/or continental set-
tings. The insights gained from this type of research are
relevant when modeling the impact of future climatic
change, but also where it concerns drafting guidelines
for conservation policies in regions of high biodiversity.

Dear colleagues,
I would like to bring to your attention the symposiumon “Integration of ﬁsh fossil data into phylogenetic and
comparative studies” that will take place on July 4 at
the University of Liege during the upcoming European
Congress of Ichthyology ( http://www.eci-14.ulg.ac.be/-
). I am hoping that this symposium will be a chance
to bring together both neo- and paleo-ichthyologists
that are integrating fossil data into systematic and
macroevolutionary studies (e.g., phylogenetic inference
using both extant and extinct taxa, dating of molecular
trees, morphospace evolution across major clades, his-
torical biogeography, mass extinctions, etc.) to discuss
some of the advances in the ﬁeld and some of the re-
maining challenges. Some ﬁnancial support is available
to help defray registration or travel costs for a few stu-
dents and postdocs that plan to attend this symposium.
Please note that the deadline for early registration for
the congress and for submitting abstracts for the sym-
posium is March 12th. Interested parties should feel
free to email me with any questions.

MarineMammalGenomics
PhD position in Marine Mammal Evolutionary ge-
nomics (1.0 fte) (Reference number 212075)
Organisation
The PhD position is with the Marine Evolution and
Conservation (MarECon) group at the Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Studies (CEES) which is
placed with the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural
Sciences at the University of Groningen in the Nether-
lands. The research conducted by the members of
MarECon is aimed at the evolution and conservation of
pelagic marine organisms, in particular marine mam-
mals. We are interested in those processes that parti-
tion genetic variation within those species that inhabit
this comparatively open environment. Our primary re-
search approach is population genetics and genomics.
The research is conducted with a global network of col-
laborators who collect data and tissue samples in the
ﬁeld.
Job description
The pinnipeds and cetaceans represent some of the
most derived mammal groups. The many convergent
features in these two groups provide clear evidence of
the strong natural selection the mammal “bauplan” is
subjected to when transitioning to a marine existence.
The combination of strong convergent evolution in dif-
ferent lineages of mammals constitutes an excellent op-
portunity to gain insights into the genomic underpin-
nings of the evolution and adaptation in pinnipeds and
cetaceans and the subsequent radiations into diﬀerent
distinct marine habitats.
The objective of this PhD project is to utilize genome
enabled methods to identify those traits under past and
recent selection in pinnipeds and cetaceans. The re-
search will mainly consist of genome wide-scans in se-
lect population samples and subsequent bioinformatics
and population genomic analyses of those data. The
newly ﬁtted laboratory is situated in the new green26 EvolDir April 1, 2012
building Linneausborg on the Zernike Campus with ex-
cellent facilities for this kind of work.
The PhD student will be supervised by Dr. Martine
B´ erub´ e and Prof. Per Palsbøll.
Qualiﬁcations
We are looking for a highly motivated person with a
master’s degree in biology or equivalent discipline, with
a strong background in empirical and theoretical pop-
ulation genetics. The ideal candidate for this position
has good quantitative skills and the ability to conduct
bioinformatics analyses of the large amounts of short-
read sequence data. Programming skills (or the interest
and ability to acquire such) is a necessity. The candi-
date should be able to work and solve problems inde-
pendently. Some knowledge of marine mammals is ben-
eﬁcial, but not a prerequisite. It should be noted that
the opportunities for ﬁeldwork will be few and brief.
A good command of English is required. The candi-
date will be enrolled in Groningen Graduate School of
Science, attend graduate courses within the Research
School Ecology and Evolution and participate in our
teaching program (10% of time).
Conditions of employment
The University of Groningen oﬀers a salary of EUR
2,042 gross per month in the ﬁrst year up to a maxi-
mum of EUR 2,612 gross per month in the ﬁnal year.
The employment is initially in a temporary position of
1.5 years with possible extension with another 2.5 years
provided satisfactory performance during the ﬁrst year.
The PhD candidate will be evaluated after the ﬁrst
year in order to determine the likelihood of the success-
ful completion of the PhD thesis within the following
three years. If a successful completion is deemed un-
likely, the employment will not be extended. The main
objective of the position is to publish research articles
in peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals. These publications
will form the basis of the doctoral thesis and obtaining
the PhD degree (Dr) at the University of Groningen.

LinkopingU BehaviourVariation
PhD student position in Ethology: Causes and conse-
quences of variation in animal personality
At the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biol-
ogy (IFM), Division of Biology. Link¨ oping University,
Link¨ oping, Sweden.
Job description A 4-year PhD position is oﬀered in the
subject of ethology, to conduct research on the causes
and consequences of variation in animal personality.
Animal personality is deﬁned as behavioural responses
that diﬀer among individuals, but are consistent within
individuals across context and/or time. While varia-
tion in personality was previously largely ignored, the
ﬁeld has recently experienced considerable attention.
We are now aware that, among a diversity of species
from insects to humans, individuals show personalities.
As a consequence, research on animal personality has
become a highly popular research area within animal
behaviour. However, the fundamental questions in ani-
mal personality remain unanswered, and these are often
relevant to key questions in evolutionary biology more
generally. For example, what limits behavioural plas-
ticity, why does variation in personality arise, and how
is polymorphism maintained?
The aim of the proposed project is to improve our un-
derstanding of the evolution of personality using the
red junglefowl and domestic chickens as models, by in-
vestigating both proximate mechanisms and ultimate
consequences of variation. The fowl is a particularly
suitable species for research on personality due to thepossibility of combining our extensive understanding of
behaviour, physiology and genetics in chickens, to apply
a strong experimental design while examining natural
behaviours. The advertised position can be combined
with a teaching assistantship of up to 20% within the
biology undergraduate program, which will extend the
position accordingly.
Requirements The successful applicant will be a highly
motivated and talented candidate with a Masters de-
gree in biology (or equivalent), with a specialization in
ethology, behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology or
similar. Research experience in experimental animal
behaviour, sound statistical knowledge and analytical
abilities are merits, as is experience in scientiﬁc writ-
ing. Good knowledge of written and oral English is
required. Both good cooperation skills and the abil-
ity to work independently are emphasised. The suc-
cessful candidate should be enthusiastic about animal
behaviour and handling birds.
What we oﬀer Link¨ oping University is a modern, inno-
vative university with over 27000 students and 3900 em-
ployees. Biology at Link¨ oping University oﬀers excel-
lent molecular facilities and exceptional avian housing
facilities. The successful candidate will be part of the
behavioural genomics and physiology group (AVIAN,
which currently has around 20 group members, includ-
ing 9 PhD students), which is a part of the Centre of
Excellence for Animal Welfare Science (in collaboration
with SLU Uppsala).
Link¨ oping is a popular university city, and is the ﬁfth
largest city in Sweden. It is located in central Swe-
den, just two hours by train from Stockholm, and of-
fers proximity to the beautiful nature of ¨Osterg¨ otland,
including the great lake V¨ attern, as well as both recent

Equal opportunity Link¨ oping University continues to
develop as an attractive and creative work place char-
acterized by equal opportunities, which works actively
to promote diversity and gender equality.

* Primary supervisors
There is a need for new sustainable technologies that
utilize the biomass of plants to replace the use of petro-
chemicals and creating new fuels.
Termite guts could hold the key as they are highly ef-
ﬁcient ’bioreactors’, the symbiotic bacteria harbored in
the insects intestine are capable of digesting lignocel-
lulose to short-chain fatty acids. The symbiont com-
munity of the termite gut cannot be cultured by con-ventional methods and are phylogenetic diversity with
a complex community structure. Therefore the aim of
this project is to apply the rapidly developing tech-
niques of single cell genomics to sequence small groups
of bacteria and unlock the enzymatic potential of the
termite gut symbiosis for industrial biomass conversion.
Training: This project is funded in partnership with
RIKEN, Japan ( www.riken.jp/engn/ ) and the Univer-
sity of Liverpool providing a 4-year PhD studentship
to commence from October 2012. The studentship
is part of the Liverpool International Graduate Pro-
gramme and provides an opportunity for the student
to spend up to 2 years in the lab of Dr Moriya Ohkuma
Wako, Japan. The candidate will receive speciﬁc train-
ing in molecular biology, developing expertise in using
techniques of single cell genomics and a broad training
in bioinformatics, including the handling of large data
sets and their computational interrogation. The candi-
date will also get bespoke training from the instrument
providers. A broad generic training program is also in
place for postgraduate students ranging from Bioinfor-
matics through to intellectual property and business.

PhD Fellowship for a Neurobiology project in Marseille
(France): Gompel/Prud’homme lab
In the context of the Initial training Network, FliACTApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 29
(www.ﬂiact.eu ), we are hiring a PhD student to work
on the the following project:
Neuronal basis of the evolution of sensitivity to speciﬁc
odours in Drosophila
Goal: Identifying genetic and neuronal diﬀerences un-
derlying variations in olfactory behaviours
Methodology: Diﬀerent species respond diﬀerently to
similar sensory stimuli. Variations in the sensory re-
sponse could be encoded in the sensory neurons and in
the sensory receptors expressed in these neurons. In
a screen for variations in olfactory receptor (OR) ex-
pression between Drosophila species, some species were
found to depart from the rest of the survey for expres-
sion of given ORs. Preliminary data indicate that these
changes in expression are associated with altered sensi-
tivity to the corresponding odour. The project aims at
characterizing and quantifying these diﬀerences in the
neural response and behaviour, and identifying their
cellular bases. To this end, the fellow will ﬁrst make use
of classical genetics in D. melanogaster to demonstrate
the link between a given OR and a speciﬁc odorant
compound. Then, to tackle the evolution of olfaction
between species with diﬀerent levels in OR expression,
s/he will make reporter constructs with the regulatory
regions of such ORs, then test them in diﬀerent species.
This is meant to reveal the molecular origin of the diﬀer-
ences in gene expression, and look for possible changes
in neuronal anatomy between species. Once the genet-
ics and neuroanatomy of the system are clariﬁed, the
next step will be to characterize the functional changes
between species. To test for causality between changes
in OR expression and changed sensitivity to an odour,
s/he will make use of transgenesis in diﬀerent species,
testing OR alleles of one species into the other, and as-
sessing the consequences on neural activity and behav-
ior. S/he will also take advantage of the possibility to
make hybrids between some species with diﬀerent lev-
els of expression in speciﬁc ORs. Altogether, the results
should identify the molecular and functional changes re-
sponsible for the evolution of sensitivity to particular
odours.

Master thesis: Object exploration and object play in
ravens (Corvus corax) We are looking for an enthusi-
astic student who is interested in investigating object
exploration and object play in ravens (Corvus corax) to
enable a better understanding of raven’s physical and
social cognitive skills. Interestingly, especially young
individuals show a predisposition to explore and ma-
nipulate almost every kind of object they encounter.
In addition, ravens often use non-food items in social
interactions to attract the attention of recipients. The
present study aims to investigate object exploration and
object play during ontogeny in six hand-raised ravens
by carrying out observations in combination with con-
trolled behavioural experiments. The study will start
in June 2012.
We seek a highly motivated person with organizational
skills, able and willing to work independently. You will
learn to work with six hand-raised ravens, set up the ob-
servation schedule, ﬁlm the behavior and experiments,
design and develop a coding scheme and analyze the
behavioral interactions.
We oﬀer the opportunity to work at one of the lead-
ing institutes for bird research in Germany and Europe
and to learn methods in comparative research and be-
havioural biology.

Abstract of the PhD project:
Understanding the origin and persistence of diversity
within and among species in a central question in evo-
lutionary biology. Genetic dominance among variants
in a population plays a key role in the invasion success
of new adaptive traits.
This Phd project focuses on the distribution of mor-
phological and genetic variation of mimic patterns in
neotropical butterﬂies from the genus Heliconius. In
these species, many species exhibit a mutual adaptive
resemblance. This convergence so called mimicry con-
stitutes an aposematic signal of their unpalatability,
which can be learned by predators. Several mimicry
rings coexist in a given habitat and some polymor-
phic species are involved in few distinct mimicry rings.
These polymorphic species constitute an ideal model to
understand how new adaptive traits can be established
and can be favored by selection.
In this context, since the level of dominance is modify-
ing the expression of diﬀerent variants, it had an inﬂu-
ence on their resemblance to the mimic patterns. Hence
the origin and persistence of new variants depends both
on dominance and discrimination capacities of preda-
tors. We thus aimed at jointly investigating how the
variation is genetically controlled in the polymorphic
species Heliconius numata and how predators can per-
ceive this variation.

Next generation DNA sequencing and analysis of whole
genomes has opened new possibilities for testing funda-
mental questions in speciation and adaptation. The
successful candidate for this PhD project will generate
a draft genome sequence for a New Zealand stick insect
(Clitarchus hookeri) and use this as a tool for exploring
detailed questions on adaptation within a species and
between closely related species. The common stick in-
sect (Clitarchus hookeri) is widespread through much of
New Zealand. This species is particularly interesting at
it is a geographic parthenogen and has hybridized with
closely related species. The successful candidate will
perform Illumina sequencing and assemble and anno-
tate a draft genome. This draft genome will be used as
a scaﬀold for RAD-tag studies of SNP variation within
C. hookeri and among closely related species. Tran-
scriptome data will also be collected and mapped to
the draft genome to obtain candidate genes underlying
phenotypic traits for further studies on selection and
adaptation. Variation at candidate genes will be mea-
sured and compared within and among populations of
C. hookeri and among related species. The successful
candidate should have experience in molecular evolu-
tion and genomics with an interest in developing skills
in the assembly and analysis of Next Generation DNA
sequence data. This project is funded by the Allan Wil-
son Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution and in-
cludes a $25,000 NZD per year scholarship, $5,000 for
tuition fees, and funding for international travel.

OxfordBrookesU HybridZones
Applications are invited for the following PhD project:
Genetic and geographical characterisation of the Cer-
atophyllus styx styx and C.s. jordani (sand martin ﬂea)
hybrid zone.
A hybrid zone between subspecies of the sand martin
ﬂea Ceratophyllus styx was mapped previously across
central England but since the 1990s the sand martin
host has arrived signiﬁcantly earlier in the spring. The
ﬂea subspecies diﬀer in morphology of the external mat-
ing structures in males and females and overwinter as
pupae in nest holes, emerging when disturbed by re-
turning birds, suggesting possible mechanisms for main-
taining the hybrid zone. Using combined approaches of
morphology and molecular genetics this project will in-
vestigate whether the location and structure of hybrid
zone has been inﬂuenced by changes in host phenol-
ogy and behaviour. Speciﬁcally the project will use the
following strategies: 1. Extensive ﬁeld sampling and
precision mapping of the hybrid zone of the sand mar-
tin ﬂea using morphological criteria and comparison of
the subspecies’ ranges for ﬂeas from recent and long-
established sand martin colonies. 2. DNA sequencing
to genotype populations of sand martin ﬂeas from re-36 EvolDir April 1, 2012
cent and long-established sand martin colonies along a
north-south transect including single subspecies popu-
lations and putative mixed/hybrid populations allow-
ing a genetic characterisation of the two subspecies
and estimating levels of divergence versus introgres-
sion along the transect. 3. DNA sequencing of sand
martins to ascertain if there is a genetic population
structure that parallels the distributions of the ﬂea sub-
species and sand martin breeding records. In addition
to these core aims we would allow the student some li-
cense to roam, which may include some of the following:
4. Comparative study of the hybrid zone between the
Scandinavian subspecies C.s.freyi and C.s.styx. 5.Be-
havioural/ecological studies of ﬂea mating within and
between subspecies and sand martin movement pat-
terns.
The student will be based in the Department of Bio-
logical and Medical Sciences, Oxford Brookes Univer-
sity and supervised by Dr Bruce Riddoch, Dr Casper
Breuker and Dr Alistair McGregor.
We are looking for a student who is robust and adapt-
able, with a full driving license and good interpersonal
skills (required for access to sand martin colonies), a
sound knowledge of evolutionary biology and compe-
tence in both lab and ﬁeld. We will provide specialist
training.

GENOMIC DISSECTION OF DOMESTICATION
TRAITS IN GRAPEVINE
This position is oﬀered by Edmund Mach Foundation
(Italy) within the International PhD Program in Ge-
nomics and Molecular Physiology of Fruits (GMPF).
The fellow will receive a salary of 20000 Euro per year
(taxable). The funding is provided for 3 years with the
possibility of a one-year extension.
The PhD student involved in this project will exploit
the diversity of agronomically important traits in do-
mesticated and wild grapes (Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa
and Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) to accelerate the
development of new varieties through marker-assisted
breeding. The Eurasian grape is the most widely cul-
tivated and economically important fruit crop in the
world, but it takes three years to grow this woody
perennial from seed to fruit, making traditional breed-
ing long and expensive. Recent studies have shown
that although grapes were domesticated up to eight
thousand years ago in the Near East, they still have
enough genetic diversity to oﬀer potential for develop-
ing desirable traits. The domestication of grapevine
involved a selection of suitable genotypes producing
larger and sweeter berries of attractive colors, followed
by their vegetative propagation. Wild sylvestris signiﬁ-
cantly contributed to the generation of grape cultivars,possibly through multiple introgression events from lo-
cal populations. A common feature of the cultivated
species is the diﬀerentiation of genetic diversity rela-
tive to the wild species. Such patterns of polymorphism
can be investigated by high-throughput sequencing and
genomic scans for selection. We propose to study the
spread of domestication alleles by collecting genetic in-
formation from a diverse sampling of both cultivated
and wild grapes. Using these methods the PhD student
will hunt for and then characterize the set of candidate
genes likely to have experienced selective pressures in
the recent past. Understanding this mechanism of ac-
celerated evolution is essential, because of the rising
demand for speeding up the development of grape va-
rieties that have the right combination of aroma and
taste, and are able to resist diseases, cold and drought.

Adaptation to Climate change/ Genomics/ Ancient
DNA
3 year PhD project in Australia and the Yukon Terri-
tory, Canada:
A 3 year, ARC funded project is available at the Aus-
tralian Centre for Ancient DNA, University of Adelaide,
Australia. The project will analyse genomic DNA ex-
tracted from frozen seeds and bones preserved in Arctic
permafrost for over 120,000 years to perform a detailed
genomic analysis of how plants and animals respond to
pronounced periods of climate change over evolution-
ary time scales. The project will examine the extent
to which, and how, genetic adaptation occurs at a ge-
nomic level - and contrast this with the impact and
utilisation of range shifts - which is commonly accepted
as the primary means of adaptation to climate change.
We will use NGS technology to build largescale genome
sequences from ancient plants and animals, and apply
advanced population genetics analyses to neutral and
coding data to perform detailed analyses of how species38 EvolDir April 1, 2012
adapt across time and space. This project promises to
provide unique views of the potential of plants and ani-
mals to adapt to climate change, and the use of ancient
samples to provide detailed views of genomic evolution.
The project will primarily be housed within the
Australian Centre for Ancient DNA ( http://-
www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/ ), located in the School of
Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Ade-
laide. There will also be an opportunity for ﬁeldwork
in permafrost areas of the Yukon Territory. We are
looking for a highly motivated individual with wide
interests who enjoys challenging and unusual research,
and has the ability to work closely with a wide range of
researchers, including bioinformaticists, climate change
researchers, museum personnel and evolutionary
biologists. A strong interest or (preferably) experience
with genomics, Next Gen sequencing, or bioinformatics
is important. Evidence of independent research and
writing/publishing skills would also be essential.
Project partners include Dr Grant Zazula (Yukon Pale-
ontologist), Prof Joe Cook (UNM), and Prof. Charles
Davis (Harvard).
Interested Australian and New Zealand residents are
encouraged to apply as soon as possible, and competi-
tive international students will also be considered until
the end of August.

cois Balloux in Computational Systems Biology
The eﬀect of population size ﬂuctuations on the rate of
evolution
One of the central dogmas of evolutionary genetics
states that the rate of evolution at neutral genes (sub-
stitution rate) is unaﬀected by population size ﬂuctua-
tions. However, we have recently shown that this result
does not hold in populations with overlapping genera-
tions (i.e. populations comprising individuals from dif-
ferent age classes). This result may have important
implications for our understanding of the fate of natu-
ral populations given that overlapping generations and
population size ﬂuctuations are typical in most organ-
isms. Moreover, all - mutations - be they selected or
not - are aﬀected by population demography. As such,
any regime of population ﬂuctuations could have a dra-
matic, currently unrecognised, additional genetic im-
pact on the ability of populations to respond to envi-
ronmental change. It is vitally important to establish
the generality of our previous ﬁndings and to increase
our understanding of the accumulation of resistance in
organisms with large amplitude in population ﬂuctua-
tions. Also it is critical to reﬁne our understanding of
the ability of declining populations to adapt to chang-
ing environmental conditions.
The student will ﬁrst characterise the eﬀect of demog-
raphy on substitution rates in realistic population mod-
els using analytical approaches in combination with
stochastic simulations. The second step of the project
will allow the student to test the theoretical predic-
tions using computational analyses of genomic data.
We have already in our possession several suitable ge-
nomic datasets from species comprising clades/lineages
with documented diﬀerences in past demography. The
ﬁnal step of the project will be an experimental vali-
dation of the eﬀect of population ﬂuctuations on the
rate of evolution. Various demographic regimes will be
imposed upon lineages of bacteria in an experimental
setup of “microchemostats” developed by our collabo-
rator from Biological Engineering at UCL. The genomes
of the various lineages having experienced various treat-
ments will be sequenced at the end of the experiment,
thus allowing for a direct quantiﬁcation of the number
and nature of the mutations accumulated in the various
treatments.
While focused on a well-deﬁned question, the project of-
fers exposure to theoretical, computational and experi-
mental biology and thus represents an ideal training for
a student to become a well-rounded biologist. The ideal
student would have already acquired a decent quan-
titative background. However, the most sought-after
qualities are enthusiasm, curiosity, creativity and ded-ication to the project. The project will be supervised
by Professor Francois Balloux (Professor of Computa-
tional Systems Biology, Dept. of GEE, UCL).
Applicants need to satisfy UK/EU eligibility require-
ments and have a minimum 2.1 Hons. undergrad-
uate degree. Current annual studentship stipend is
£15,590 per annum. Please apply to Prof Balloux
by email (Francois Balloux f.balloux@ucl.ac.uk) by the
30 March. Applications should include a CV and the
names, contact details and email addresses of two aca-
demic referees.

UExeter BumblebeeViruses Mar18
As advertised on ﬁndaphd.com, we would like to adver-
tise a NERC-funded PhD project on the virulence andhost-speciﬁcity of bumblebee viruses at the Cornwall
Campus of the University of Exeter, supervised by Dr.
Lena Wilfert and Prof. Mike Boots. The deadline for
application is March 18 2012.
We are inviting applications for this NERC funded PhD
studentship to commence October 2012. For eligible
students the award will cover UK/EU tuition fees and
an annual stipend (in 2011/12 this was £13,590 for full-
time students, pro rata for part-time students) for at
least three years. This project is one of a number that
are in competition for funding. Studentships will be
awarded on the basis of merit.
Successful applicants will beneﬁt from working within a
lively research environment within the Centre for Ecol-
ogy and Conservation, Biosciences, Cornwall Campus,
near Falmouth at the College of Life and Environmental
Sciences, University of Exeter.
Bumblebees are among the most important pollinating
insects. Many species and populations have recently
suﬀered drastic declines, with impacts on plant biodi-
versity and agriculture. Next to habitat loss, parasite
pressure is one of the potential causes of these species
declines. In particular rapidly adapting viral diseases,
which might readily jump between host species, may
drive host population dynamics. Viruses are impor-
tant parasites of honeybees, but have so far been little
studied in bumblebees. The aim of this project is to
investigate the virulence and host speciﬁcity of newly
identiﬁed bumblebee viruses. The project will combine
ﬁeldwork with experimental infection experiments to
determine the eﬀects of viral infections on bee health.
From this starting point, the degree of host-speciﬁcity -
and thus the risk for disease emergence - may be assayed
directly through experimental evolution. Using phylo-
genetic methods, experimental results can be compared
to the demographic history of viruses in the ﬁeld to
test whether experimental evolution recapitulates nat-
ural evolution.
This project will combine ﬁeldwork in the UK with ex-
perimental infection assays in the lab. The work will
heavily rely on molecular techniques, such as quanti-
tative PCR and sequencing, for quantifying infections
and for studying viral sequence evolution. The student
will be trained in these methods and will be closely
involved with the disease group at Tremough, includ-
ing Prof. Mike Boots, Prof. Angus Buckling, Dr.
Britt Koskella and Dr. Michiel Vos. Please contact
Dr. Lena Wilfert (lena.wilfert@ed.ac.uk) for informal

UExeter InsectFitnessMaximization
A fully funded NERC PhD position is available from
October 2012 at the Centre for Ecology and Conserva-
tion at the University of Exeter’s Cornwall Campus.
Social networks in wild insects
This project will investigate the possibility that wild in-
sects have networks of places and/or other individuals
that they interact with in a non-random fashion. An
important issue in animal reproduction is to identify
a mate that will maximise the ﬁtness of the searching
individual or their oﬀspring. Many diﬀerent cues have
been identiﬁed that are used for both mate ﬁnding and
mate choice, but we have no idea whether non-social
invertebrates may preferentially interact with a group
of preferred conspeciﬁcs rather than simply encounter-
ing other individuals at random. This study will be
integrated with a project we have to record the lives of
every individual in a natural population of ﬁeld crick-
ets (Gryllus campestris) in a ﬁeld in Northern Spain.
All individuals are tagged and DNA ﬁngerprinted and
a network of video cameras records their movements
and interactions (see www.wildcrickets.org ). The stu-
dentship will test hypotheses about movement, socialinteractions and behaviour in this unique study system.
It requires a highly self motivated, resourceful and am-
bitious student with a strong interest in evolution and
behaviour, prepared to work in Spain for several weeks
a year and not afraid of using quantitative techniques
to analyse data.

dentship available for 2012 start Application deadline
April 30th 2012
This project will use observations, playback experi-
ments and acoustic analyses to investigate the develop-
ment and function of vocal communication, and explore
the cognitive challenges of social life in a large-brained
bird, the jackdaw. The student will join the dynamic
Centre for Ecology & Conservation at the University

wild jackdaws in the beautiful Cornish countryside.
Corvids (members of the crow family) are renowned for
their cognitive sophistication, but the selective pres-
sures driving corvid cognitive evolution are not under-
stood. This project will explore an important potential
driving force, the need to navigate the challenges of life
in complex and dynamic societies. Working with a nest-
box population of wild jackdaws, the project will exam-
ine how jackdaws’ communicative abilities develop and
investigate the socio-cognitive skills involved in recog-
nising group members and tracking the relationships42 EvolDir April 1, 2012
between them.
The candidate will join a growing research group work-
ing on the evolution and development of cognition and
culture and will be supervised by Dr Alex Thornton,
a specialist in behaviour and cognition in wild ani-
mals. Please note that Alex Thornton is currently
based in Cambridge but will be relocating to the CEC
in September 2012.
Entry requirements:
You must have obtained, or be about to obtain, a First
or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree, or the

“Causes and consequences of variation in dispersal be-
haviour”
Organization
This research project is a collaborative eﬀort of the
research groups Theoretical Biology and Behavioural
Ecology and Self-organization (BESO), which both are
part of the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary
Studies at the University of Groningen (The Nether-
lands). The research is funded by a TopGrant (ALW-
TOP/11.017) allocated to Prof. Jan Komdeur from the
Netherlands Science Foundation (NWO).Job description
In many organisms individuals diﬀer systematically in
their dispersal behaviour. Moreover, individual vari-
ation in dispersal is correlated with other traits, in-
cluding metabolism, activity, aggressiveness, boldness,
sociability, behavioural ﬂexibility and learning ability.
Although such correlation structures (“dispersal syn-
dromes”) have been described for many species, nei-
ther their evolutionary emergence nor their ecological,
evolutionary and genetic consequences are well under-
stood. By means of a theoretical approach (using an-
alytical models and individual-based computer simula-
tions) the project will address questions such as: Why
are the dispersal syndromes in diﬀerent species remark-
ably similar in some respects and remarkably diﬀerent
in others? What are the consequences of variation in
dispersal for social evolution (e.g., cooperative breed-
ing) and the mating system? What are the implications
of non-equilibrium dynamics for the genetic structure
of a population and for the estimation of pedigrees, re-
latedness and ﬁtness?
The project is designed as a 4-year PhD project; how-
ever, we also welcome applications from exceptional
post-doctoral researchers for a 3-year position. The
close collaboration between theoretical and behavioural
researchers, along with access to the long-term Sey-
chelles warbler dataset, provides a unique opportunity
to forge a link between conceptual models and real-
world data.
Qualiﬁcations
- MSc in Theoretical Biology, Behavioural Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology or related discipline (for a PhD
candidate) or a PhD in any of these disciplines (for a
postdoc).

Graduate position- Testing the relative roles of compe-
tition and plant-soil feedbacks in explaining common-
ness and rarity of alien and native plants
PhD in plant ecology, University of Konstanz, Germany
Project supervisors- Prof. Mark van Kleunen, Dr.
Wayne Dawson
Stabilising mechanisms, such as resource-partitioning
and density-dependent soil pests and pathogens, are
considered to be crucial for species coexistence. The
role of these stabilising mechanisms in explaining vari-
ation in abundance of species has received recent atten-
tion, as common species may suﬀer less from negative
intraspeciﬁc interactions, or less from soil pests and
pathogens at high density, compared to rare species.
This PhD position will involve conducting ﬁeld and
greenhouse experiments, to tease apart the relative
roles of plant-soil feedbacks and competitive ability in
explaining commonness of both native and alien plant
species occurring in Germany. The position will start
from the 1st May.
The successful candidate should ideally have some ex-
perimental experience working with plants, as well
as experience in analysing ecological data. Appli-
cants should send a letter of application, explaining
your motivation, research interests and relevant expe-
rience as well as a CV and contact details of at least
two references, to Wayne Dawson (wayne.dawson@uni-
konstanz.de) by 31st March.

ULeicester InsectGeneticLoad
NERC PhD Studentship:
Genome-wide genetic load in a social insect
University of Leicester
About the award We are inviting applications for this
NERC funded PhD studentship to commence October
2012. For eligible students the award will cover UK/EU
tuition fees and an annual stipend (in 2011/12 this was44 EvolDir April 1, 2012
ˆA£13,590 net for full-time students) for at least three
years. Studentships will be awarded on the basis of
merit.
The successful applicant will beneﬁt from working
within a lively research environment in the Department
of Biology, within the larger School of Biological Science
and will also ﬁt into the College of Biology, Medicine
and Psychology’s research theme Genome Science.
Background selection - selection that purges deleteri-
ous mutations - is an important mechanism shaping
genomic variation. The eﬃcacy of background selec-
tion, however, depends upon mutations being ˆ avisible’
to selection. For example, recessive deleterious muta-
tions can be purged when homozygous because they
express the deleterious phenotype, but ineﬀectively
purged when heterozygous because the deleterious al-
lele is sheltered by the expressed allele.
We are looking for a PhD student to investigate the
eﬀect of gene expression and ploidy on the visibility of
genetic variation to selection and the resultant genome-
wide genetic load. Hymenoptera are haplo-diploid:
males haploid and females diploid, and these ploidy
diﬀerences, coupled with sex-speciﬁc expression, will
alter the relative visibility of genes to selection. The
male-only expressed genome is continuously exposed to
selection because of haploidy. Conversely, female-only
expressed deleterious genes will be sheltered from se-
lection when heterozygous. We wish to test two ex-
plicit predictions of this reasoning. First, that the dis-
tribution of genetic load (the proportion of deleteri-
ous mutations at a locus in a population) across the
genome should be ˆ alumpy’ with lower genetic load at
male-only expressed genes compared to female-only ex-
pressed genes. Second, that, on average, overall load is
lower than that found in diplo-diploid species.
This studentship requires a highly motivated and am-
bitious student with a strong interest in evolution,
genomics and the use of next generation sequencing.
The experiments will mostly be lab based (little ﬁeld-
work). This studentship is timely, as more than ten
Hymenoptera genomes have been sequenced in the past
year, and developments in next generation sequencing
make tractable genomic re-sequencing studies on non
model species with interesting biology. The successful
student will get excellent training in these inﬂuential
and important techniques.

ULondon VirulenceEvolution
Modelling the evolution of virulence in a bacterial pest
control agent
Supervisors: Prof. Vincent Jansen and Dr Ben Ray-
mond
School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway, Univer-
sity of LondonFully funded PhD position to start September 2012:
Bacteria and bacterial toxins are widely used in the
control of insect pests. The most successful of these
is the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis which accounts
for most of the world’s production of organic microbial
formulations and which provides the toxin genes for the
vast majority of the world’s insect resistant genetically
modiﬁed crops.
As a natural agent the capacity for bacteria to kill their
hosts is subject to selection, and bacterial virulence (i.e.
the capacity to kill the host) will adapt and evolve. Two
major selective forces that will act on such bacteria are
the competition for host resources that will take place
between bacteria, and on the other hand the amount
of spores that will be produced from a host. Often
increased ability to compete trades oﬀ against spore
production, and therefore the evolution of the bacteria
will have to strike a balance between these two forces.
As both the magnitude of the eﬀect of production and
competition depend on the presence of other strains,
the evolution of virulence is similar to the evolution
of social traits such as cooperation and altruistic be-
haviour.
This project aims to understand the evolution of viru-
lence through the development of mathematical models,
and will build on previous work by the Jansen research
group in this area (see e.g Gandon et al. 2002, Bryden
and Jansen 2010, Lion et al. 2011). The research will be
informed by empirical work on the role of competition,
virulence and reproductive success of B. thuringinsis
in the insect Plutella xylostella (Raymond et al 2007,
Garbutt et al 2011). An aspect of particular interest is
the presence of population structure of a bacterial pop-
ulation within the insect host, which emerges through
spatial structure within the host and the occurrence of
and co-infection of a host by multiple strains of bacte-
ria. This work will seek to understand on the one hand
the factors that control the virulence of the pathogen,
which is important for practical application of the bac-
teria as a pest control agent. On the other hand the
research will aim to understand the theoretical connec-
tions between the frameworks used for the evolution of
virulence and the evolution of social behaviour. The
details of the project will be ﬁnalised taking the in-
terests and capabilities of the candidates into account.
Although the project is intended to be mainly theoret-
ical, depending on whether this in the interest of the
development of the candidate and the science, practi-
cal elements could be included. This project is suitable
for candidates with a proven record in mathematical
modelling. We are looking for candidates, either with a
background in the life sciences, and experience in math-
ematical or simulation modelling, or for candidates with46 EvolDir April 1, 2012
a background in a quantitative subject (e.g. mathe-
matics, computer science, physics, economics) and an
aﬃnity for research in ecology and evolution. We ex-
pect a 2.1 or ﬁrst class degree (or equivalent if not a
UK degree).
This studentship will be part of the BBSRC doctoral
training partnership that Royal Holloway has together
with Imperial College London. Therefore the con-
ditions and eligibility rules of the BBSRC apply, of
which the main condition is residency in the UK for
the last 3 years (see http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/web/-

UNeuchatel EvolutionaryEcology
SparrowsPhD Position in evolutionary ecology, University of
Neuch ˜Atel, Switzerland
A fully-funded 3-year PhD position is available in Fab-
rice Helfenstein’s lab at the University of Neuch ˜Atel,
Switzerland, to work on the causes and consequences
of oxidative stress in avian semen. The position and
research project are funded by the Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation.
Oxidative stress is pervasive and represents a major
selective pressure throughout the animal kingdom. In
particular, vertebrate spermatozoa are very suscepti-
ble to oxidative stress, which may aﬀect sperm perfor-
mance and male fertility. Oxidative processes are thus
hypothesised to have a profound impact on the devel-
opment of male reproductive strategies and antioxidant
allocation strategies in species where males face sperm
competition, the circumstance where sperm of two or
more males compete to fertilise the same batch of eggs.
This project will test whether antioxidant allocation
strategies underlie the development of male reproduc-
tive tactics in relation to social status as predicted by
sperm competition models. This goal will be achieved
using a combination of ﬁeld observations, ﬁeld experi-
ments and aviary experiments on house sparrows Passer
domesticus.
The ideal candidate is highly motivated and creative
with a keen interest in evolutionary questions. He/she
shows a capacity to work both independently and as a
team member and has excellent writing and communi-
cation skills in English. She/he has a background in
evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and/or eco-
physiology. Previous experience with bird handling, lab
work, experimental design and/or statistics is not essen-
tial but desirable. A MSc (or equivalent) in Biology is
required. The successful applicant will be based at the
Institute of Biology, University of Neuch ˜Atel. This post
oﬀers opportunities to collaborate and interact with re-
searchers working in related and complementary ﬁelds
(http://www2.unine.ch/biol/page-7860 en.html ). Our
research groups are international and our working lan-
guage is English. Knowledge of French is useful, but
not essential. Neuch ˜Atel is an attractive city, situated
by a beautiful lake at the foot of the Jura mountains
and facing the Berner Oberland mountains. The city
provides plenty of opportunities for cultural activities
and sports and oﬀers a high quality of life. Its excel-
lent public transports make it easy to leave the city
and head to the mountains for outdoor activities such
as hiking, climbing or skiing.

UStAndrews NewCaledonianCrows
UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS SCHOOL OF BI-
OLOGY
4-year fully funded PhD studentship “Tool use and cul-
ture in wild New Caledonian crows”
BACKGROUND
The New Caledonian crow Corvus moneduloides is en-
demic to a remote, tropical island in the South Pa-
ciﬁc, where it habitually uses tools for extracting in-
vertebrate prey from deadwood and vegetation. New
Caledonian crows exhibit a remarkable degree of be-
havioural sophistication: they manufacture at least
three diﬀerent tool types (including the most sophisti-
cated animal tool yet discovered); they can modify and
combine tools to achieve a goal; and they have even
been observed inventing new tool designs to solve novel
problems.
Perhaps most intriguingly, it has been suggested that
wild New Caledonian crows may progressively reﬁne
their tool technology through culturally accumulating
innovations – a phenomenon hitherto believed to be
uniquely human. Most research to date has focused on
the species cognitive abilities and on mapping natural
variation in tool morphology, but the evolutionary, eco-
logical and social context of these birds unusual tool-use
behaviour remains poorly understood.
This PhD project will chart the ecology and behaviourApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 49
of wild, free-ranging crows, using detailed ﬁeld obser-
vations, systematic surveys, and a suite of novel biolog-
ging technologies, including animal-borne video cam-
eras. In addition, speciﬁc hypotheses will be examined
in controlled experiments with wild and captive crows
(the latter will be kept for brief periods of time in ﬁeld
aviaries). Taken together, this observational and exper-
imental research will produce a much clearer picture of
the ecological signiﬁcance of crow tool use, and its pos-
sible cultural underpinnings.
This fully-funded PhD project oﬀers exciting opportu-
nities for a keen ﬁeld biologist: to conduct topical re-
search on animal tool use and culture in a high-proﬁle
study system; to join an established, well-funded ﬁeld
research project; to receive training in state-of-the-art

UWesternSydney LifeHistory
PhD Scholarship: Using telomere dynamics to detect a
physiological constraint on the pace of life-histories.
The Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at the
University of Western Sydney, Australia, is seeking a
PhD candidate to work on a project in the ﬁeld of phys-
iological and evolutionary ecology. The PhD candidate
is anticipated to commence in ﬁrst semester 2012.
The project broadly seeks to understand the physiolog-
ical basis of trade-oﬀs in life history ecology and evo-
lution. In particular, it will test the hypothesis that
oxidative stress is a cost associated with increased in-
vestment in current production relative to future sur-
vival. The candidate will design and conduct a series of
hypothesis-driven experiments to determine how vari-
ation in the pace of key life-history traits aﬀect rates
of telomere shortening and other molecular indices of
oxidative stress. These experiments will shed light on
the potential for individual mice to make physiologi-
cal adjustments in response to perceived environmental
conditions that maximise lifetime ﬁtness but are asso-
ciated with variation in rates of decline in physiological
function.
The student will be advised by Dr Christopher Turbill
(Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment) and work
in collaboration with Professor Rob Brooks, Director
of the Evolution and Ecology Research Centre at the
University of New South Wales.50 EvolDir April 1, 2012

Physiological ﬂexibility as an evolved trait to adapt to
changing environments
Position available immediately for 2.5 years, with the
option to extend for one year. Deadline for application
is the 2nd of April and interviews will take place in
April.
Key words: respirometry; animal handling; blood sam-
pling; AVP; hormone assays; physiological adaptation;
social ﬂexibility; ecology and evolution
I am looking for a PhD candidate to study physiological
ﬂexibility as an evolved trait. Changes in physiology
enable adaptation to changing environments (physio-
logical adaptation) and regulate behavioral adaptation.
The main aim of our research group is to understand
the evolved physiological mechanisms that allow ani-
mals to behave adaptively in a changing environment.
(See full project summary at end of email).
The student will be supervised by Dr. Carsten
Schradin and be part of the research group study-
ing African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio;
see www.stripedmouse.com and www.ieu.uzh.ch/-
research/behaviour/endocrinology.html ).
I am seeking a highly-motivated, independent candi-
date with excellent organizational skills. Strong intel-
lectual skills are desired. Technical skills are mandatory
to run the respirometry ﬁeld laboratory.
The ideal candidate has a background in eco-
physiology, behavioral endocrinology or behavioral
ecology. Of advantage is experience with animal han-
dling, with respirometry, with hormone analyses, in ex-
perimental design and statistical analysis of data. The
working language in my group is English.
The student will be based at the Department of An-
imal Behavior, Institute of Evolutionary Biology and
Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich.
In Zurich the PhD student has to visit courses (12
ECS) and give lectures to fulﬁll the conditions of
the PhD program in evolutionary biology: http://-
www.evobio.uzh.ch/index.html . Zurich is a highly at-
tractive city in beautiful surroundings, with a multi-52 EvolDir April 1, 2012
national population, and many educational and recre-
ational opportunities ( http://www.zuerich.com ).
Laboratory work will be done at the CNRS in Stras-
bourg (France) where I will be positioned from October
2012 onwards.
Data will be collected in the ﬁeld in South Africa, where
the PhD student has to spend two ﬁeld seasons of ap-
prox. 9 months each. In the ﬁeld, the candidate has
to run independently the respirometry laboratory and
conduct ﬁeld experiments with the help of ﬁeld assis-
tants.
The student will be supervised by me during my stays
in Zurich (twice a year) and in the ﬁeld (twice a year)
as well as during the stay of the student in Strasbourg,
which is only 2 hs from Zurich.
The ﬁrst 6 months will be a trial period during which
time the student has to visit courses in Zurich, develop
a research proposal and spend 2 months in the ﬁeld.
After the trial period the position can be extended for
another 2 years. The student can apply for funding
another year from the University of Zurich.
The salary follows the Swiss National Science Foun-
dation scale and is very competitive, especially for
somebody spending signiﬁcant time in South Africa
(CHF 41 000 for the ﬁrst year, CH 44 400 for the
second year; this is 34 000 Euro during the ﬁrst
and 37 000 Euro during the second year). The stu-
dent is expected to apply for funding for an addi-
tional year, for example from the Forschungskredit
in Zurich ( http://www.researchers.uzh.ch/promotion/-
forschungskredit en.html ).
The position can be ﬁlled immediately.Deadline for application is the 2nd of April and inter-
views will take place in April.

Full-time teaching/prep positions in Biology 102L “Ge-
netics and Evolution,” Duke University
Position description: Work full time (40 hours/week)
as a teaching assistant and laboratory prep assistant
in the introductory biology program for the 2012-2013
academic year. The position has two main components,
teaching and behind-the-scenes laboratory preparation.
Teaching component: The primary teaching responsi-
bility of the position is to lead laboratory sections of up
to 16 students in the Biology Department’s new genet-
ics and evolution Gateway course, Biology102L. Each
Biology 102L section meets weekly for 2.5 hours for a
combined hands-on laboratory/problem-based learning
session. Additional teaching responsibilities include (a)
attending and taking notes at all course lectures in-
cluding the weekly large discussion section, (b) grad-
ing weekly student written assignments and occasional
oral presentations, (c) helping with the preparation and
grading of mid-semester hourly and ﬁnal exams, and
(d) assisting students during oﬃce hours and otherwise
mentoring students as beginning biologists.
Teaching assistants should plan to be in Durham early
the week of August 20, 2012, and are expected to par-
ticipate in a teacher-training workshop before the fall
semester begins. TAs also attend weekly prep sessions
during the semester on Mondays.
Prep component: The second set of duties associated
with the position is to assist in the preparatory work for
the teaching labs in Biology 101L, 102L, and the labo-
ratory diversity course, Biology 106L, as determined by
the Lab Administrator. Responsibilities include setting
up and putting away equipment and specimens for lab-
oratory exercises, maintaining supplies in lab rooms be-
tween sections, cleaning glassware, assisting with ﬁeld
collection of live specimens, and helping to care for a
diverse collection of invertebrate animals in salt-water
aquaria. The lab prep workload is likely to require
evening (until 10 PM) and/or early morning (8 AM)
work.
Salary: The projected salary for the position is $17,500
or commensurate with experience. Employment begins
on August 20, 2012 and ends May 10, 2013, with most of
the winter and spring breaks oﬀ, with payment made in
9 equal amounts on the 25th of each month starting inApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 57

EvolutionInst ExecDirector
*Executive Director of the Evolution Institute*
The Institute has operated without a staﬀ since its in-
ception as a ’proof of concept’ in 2009 under the aus-
pices of the Humanists of Florida Association. It in-
corporated in Florida, 2010 and received 501c-3 statusfrom the IRS in March, 2011. The Institute has func-
tioned as a result of the volunteer eﬀorts of its board
of directors and part-time graduate students. Funding
until now has limited the activities of the Institute to
employ full-time professional personnel and maintain a
core organizational infrastructure. Yet much has been
accomplished and the reputation of it has grown con-
siderably along with increased ﬁnancial support.
The Institute is now in a position to appoint a full-time
executive director to assist it in transitioning to a viable
and sustainable internationally recognized evolutionary
science based research and policy institute. However,
funding and commitment has still not reached the level
needed to ensure a long-term commitment to support
an executive director or build an infrastructure that can
function eﬀectively in the long-term. This necessitates
appointing an executive director for at least a year that
has the ability and experience to work closely with the
board to implement the approved business/strategic
plan that will result in a successful transition from a
cyberspace organization to one that will seriously con-
sider a strategic location and presence to advance its
mission and goals.
Therefore, the recruitment of the ﬁrst executive direc-
tor will require someone with considerable talent willing
to take some risk, but not expected to relocate initially.
*Responsibilities:*
- Overall management and the implementation and
achievement of the approved board of directors’ busi-
ness/strategic plan - Direction, supervision and evalua-
tion of all employees directly in the chain of command
to the oﬃce as determined by the board - Maintaining
eﬀective communication with the board of directors,
including organizing and preparing for its meeting and
providing informed reports and recommendations - En-
suring the science and executive advisory councils are
functioning eﬀectively in achieving their mission and
responsibilities - Coordinating and fully participating
in fundraising eﬀorts (including grant writing) that en-
ables the organization to achieve its annual objectives
and grow - Timely submission of all reports required by
state and federal agencies to maintain non-proﬁt sta-
tus - Building a database that includes information to
submit and ﬁle reports and policies and procedures to
properly operate the organization and maximize trans-
parency and accountability - Serves as central staﬀ per-
son for timely and eﬀective communication between EI
its external partners, organizations it is cooperating
with and interested parties. - Reports to the board
of directors
*Qualiﬁcations:* An excellent documented track record
in serving as a top or senior level non-proﬁt organiza-58 EvolDir April 1, 2012
tion is highly desirable. Preference will be given to
someone that combines a background in science and/or
technology and is an accomplished manager. Spe-
cial consideration will be given to a prospect who is
presently or recently employed in an important profes-
sional position with an organization that has strong sci-
entiﬁc credentials and considerable accomplishments.
A person who has raised substantial money from indi-
viduals and foundations will be given additional weight.
Prior successful relations with representatives of the
media/press and governmental oﬃcials are important.
A Ph.D. or its equivalent is preferred. A M.A. or M.S.
is required.
*Salary:* Commensurate with experience, credentials,
past performance and recommendations.
*Starting:* $45,000-$60,000

ing ESBL genes and various populations of E. coli in
order to explain the evolutionary success of ESBL.
Missions: The successful candidate will participate in
*missions* assigned to the laboratory within the frame-
work of the *Replicolscope* project: - setting up of
a relational database containing sequences and other
MetaData related to plasmids of Enterobacteria (pub-
lic and locally sequenced). - performing syntactic and
functional annotations of plasmidic sequences based on
original strategies for the construction of gene models
and on the protein families characterization. - integrat-
ing and performing comparative analyses of the data in
order to target genomic regions for which expert an-
notation is required. - training of the partners of the
project on the use of the platform MicroScope / Repli-
coScope.
The whole work will rely on the use and the extension
of the MicroScope platform developed in our laboratory
(further details at http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/-
microscope ).
Required skills and experiences: The successful appli-
cant will have: - a Master degree in computer science,
computational biology, or related ﬁeld - good knowledge
of Prokaryote genomics - experience in tools devoted to
genome analyses (comparative genomics, statistics). -
experience in oriented bioinformatics programming lan-
guages in UNIX environment (Bash, Perl, SQL, Java)
and compiled languages (C/C++), relational databases
and construction of computational pipelines.
Position: Minimum one year ﬁxed-term contract. Ef-
fective start date ASAP. Salary will depend on the can-
didate’s experience (minimum gross salary: 2200 eu-
ros/month).
Closing Date: *April 11 2012* Send detailed CV

Research: Eco-ethological study of termite species of
economical and ecological importance Qualiﬁcations:
Applicants should have a solid and signiﬁcant exper-
tise in relevant aspects of insect biology and high pro-
ﬁle publishing in their ﬁeld. A good knowledge of in-
sect ecology and ethology (communication, reproduc-
tive strategies, intra- and inter-speciﬁc interactions),
and experience with working in the tropics will be ap-
preciated.
Research project: The successful candidate will de-
velop a collaborative research project involving the
LEEC (University of Paris 13) and the IBIOS (Team
BIOEMCO IRD France Nord). The project concerns
investigation of the social organisation (division of
labour, caste partitioning, nestmate recognition, repro-
ductive strategies, etc.) and the biological and molec-
ular features of several species of termites with diﬀer-
ent food regimes. The aim of this comparative and
integrated approach should be to determine the evolu-
tionary, ecological and ethological conditions responsi-
ble of the spreading of species that are potentially pest
of tropical cultivars, in order to develop novel strategies
for insect control.

Best methods for Phylogenetics
Dear EvolDir Members,
When you were asked the question “What can phy-
logenetics and molecular dating do nowadays”, which
top 3 papers would you cite? Which studies impressed
you most regarding number of taxa included, num-
ber and quality of calibration points/available fossil
data base, quality of methods used for phylogenetic in-
ference, number/length of genes (genomes) included,
methods for molecular dating used and so on....What is
your personal gold standard today? Or in other words,
which studies would you present in a class as today’s
state of the art?
I would very much appreciate your suggestions. Best

BUCKy
Has anyone had this issue trying to run BUCKy
(Bayesian Untangling of Concordance Knots), a
species/gene tree reconciliation program (An´ e et al.April 1, 2012 EvolDir 77
(2007)? The program loads the *.in ﬁles (the individual
locus input ﬁles generated from Mr.Bayes output using
the component mbsum), but crashes for me whenever it
starts to generate the main event, the concordance ﬁle
wherein species trees are written. The concordance ﬁle
will only have a single line with the word “translate”
in it after the crash. I have written to both authors,
and neither has responded. I have tried running the
program in Windows 7 and Windows XP, but not (yet)
Linux. That may be the problem - the Windows exe-
cutable is I believe fairly new and may be buggy. Any
ideas will be appreciated.

Coalescent simulations
Hi,
I’m doing my Masters and am trying to ﬁgure a few
things out about coalescent simulations in DNA SP.
If I am looking for recombination via the ZZ statistic
of Linkage disequilibrium, then it is my understand-
ing that ZZ increases as recombination increases. Am
I right in thinking that because I need the value to be
signiﬁcantly HIGH, that I am looking for a p-value (in
the DNA SP coalescent simulation tool) that is 0.975
or higher? My thinking is that this would mean that
there is a p <0.025 chance of ZZ being higher than ob-
served and therefore being classed as signiﬁcant under
a 95% conﬁdence? If I got this value, would this be an
indication of recombination within that population?
I have similar issues with Fu’s Fs statistic, where I am
looking for a signiﬁcantly high value that would point
towards a population bottle neck.
Thanks

Recently I posted a message asking for feedback from
users of the Ion Torrent and how it compares to the
Illumina MiSeq.I received many responses from others
interested in the answer to this question, but unfortu-
nately I did not receive any replies from anyone actually
using this equipment. I did however receive some links
to other sites with pertinent information and a very in-
formative comparison of these two platforms.These are
listed below.I would still appreciate any additional in-
formation on this topic.

And then here is a recent anouncement from Life Tech-
nologies about a
new small sequencer:
http://goo.gl/9X8lc 2.) Here is a very helpful blog
with information about many NGS platforms:
http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/ I also contacted Dr.
Keith Robison - the author of this blog - and asked him
speciﬁcally to compare the Ion Torrent and the Illumina
MiSeq.His response is pasted below.
Just as a reminder – I haven’t had hands on either ma-
chine (I have yet to see a MiSeq up close) but I have had
data generated for me on both systems & have tried to
seriously envision what each system would be like to
have in a lab at my employer in terms of cost & labor.
Some key points to consider:
Both machines have a sequence output well suited for
amplicon sequencing and for small genome sequencing
(probably up through a few tens of megabases). Neither
is well suited for really large genomes, metagenomes, for
transcriptomes or for counting applications (e.g. ChIP-Seq) – the numbers of reads and amount of data are re-
ally too small and the cost per basepair is much higher
than a system like HiSeq.
From a user’s perspective, the main two reasons to go
with these systems rather than HiSeq/GAIIx is the low
cost per experiment and rapid turnaround time.
MiSeq has a greater range of software on the aca-
demic/freeware side; Ion doesn’t really seem to have
caught the bioinformatic developer community’s imag-
inaition. Some software developed for 454 should work
with Ion Torrent data, due to each having similar er-
ror proﬁles (homopolymer runs); this error proﬁle also
frustrates some software designed for Illumina. On the
other hand, a lot of tool are platform-agnostic. On the
commercial side, there does seem to be healthy support
for all platforms.
Contrasting the two systems further are the read pro-
ﬁles. MiSeq oﬀers a number of read lengths up to 150x2
paired end (which is longer than HiSeq and perhaps one
reason why MiSeq may have an edge over HiSeq for
genome assembly). Ion now has ~250bp reads (you get
a distribution) and a paired end protocol, though not a
lot of groups are using it & I haven’t seen 250x2 paired
end data yet (which would be very cool to have!).
Both are probably going to have further read length im-
provements. I’m guessing the next Ion mark will be in
the 300-350 range and probably be released sometime
this spring. Several groups have demonstrated greater
than 150 bp runs on the MiSeq, and Illumina will be
releasing longer kits this summer (I think 250x2 is the
ﬁrst one).
Overall, I think the true end-to-end run times are get-
ting very similar, but Ion may still be a bit better –
if you are willing to put in the extra labor. Also, in
planning throughput the timings can be troublesome.
For example, right now the 150x2 mode takes 27 hours,
which means if you were running just that & didn’t
have shifts 24x7, it is hard to keep the machine crank-
ing all week (Illumina is ﬁnding clever ways to shorten
cycle time; I think their reps told me the 250x2 will take
/less/ time than that, though I could be remembering
that wrong.).
it does appear that the 318 chip is the end of the PGM
line, though LIFE has not made that explicit – Proton
will be the instrument for doing big sequencing. MiSeq
will get an upgrade this summer to allow reading both
surfaces of the ﬂowcell; this will roughly double the
amount of data. Both will probably top out at a size
suitable for targeted sequencing in model systems or
with very focused exome arrays (but not whole exome).

OrthoMaM database update
Dear Evoldir members,
We are pleased to announce the release of OrthoMaM
version 7: a major update of our database of ortholo-
gous single-copy nuclear markers (exons and CDS) for
mammalian phylogenetics.
It can be browsed and queried at:
http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/ The new ver-
sion 7 is based on EnsEMBL release v65 and now in-
cludes 6,111 exons and 13,111 CDS alignments for 39
mammalian species.
Major changes from the previous version 6 include:
* Requests on 39 species instead of 36 (based on En-
sEMBL v65 December 2011). * Alignments have been
improved and now rely on MACSE to detect potential
frameshifts (indicated by “!”). * Unreliable alignment
sites/sequences are removed using trimAl before phylo-
genetic analyses using RAxML (raw and ﬁltered align-
ments are provided). * Exon orthology prediction has
been improved and is now based on the correspond-
ing CDS alignments. * Marker detail rendering is now
compatible with most web browsers: Firefox, Internet
Explorer, Safari, Chrome. * A visual rendering of GO
annotation is now available based on the OntoFocus
tool.
The article describing the original database is freely
available from BMC Evolutionary Biology:

Panama VolFieldAssist SocialWasps
Volunteer Field Assistant Required Social Behaviour in
Tropical Paper Wasps Mid April - Late June 2012
A volunteer ﬁeld assistant is required to help with a
ﬁeld-based project on social behaviour in social wasps.
The position is a fantastic opportunity to gain tropical
ﬁeld experience working in a vibrant research group,
from the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of Lon-
don ( www.zsl.org/seiriansumner ). The project is con-
cerned with the evolution of castes (queens and work-
ers) in Polistes paper wasps. These are a well-studied
genus of social insects representing the early stages of
social evolution where castes lack morphological dif-
ferences, but have clear behavioural roles. Our study
species is the tropical Polistes canadensis, found in Cen-
tral and South America. It builds small nests (c20-60
females) that lack an envelope, so individually marked
wasps can be easily observed and castes can be manipu-
lated. The 2012 ﬁeld site is based near the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Station at Galatea, Colon, Republic
of Panama and the ﬁeld season will run from mid April
until end of June.
The work involves marking wasps, conducting censuses
and behavioural observations and simple manipulation
experiments. Assistants are generally expected to be
graduates with a good degree in the biological sciences,
background in and keen interest in behavioural ecol-
ogy and/or social evolution. ˆA Experience gained on the
project will be especially useful for those soon to com-
mence a ﬁeld-based MSc or PhD project. ˆA Applicants
should be ﬁt, enthusiastic, hard working, and happy
with living shared accommodation and working in un-
comfortable conditions. Previous experience of working
on social insects and/or in the tropics would be an ad-
vantage. A clean driving license and some basic knowl-
edge of Spanish is also desirable. The applicant should
be comfortable and must be able to commit to the full
ﬁeld season. NB these wasps do sting if provoked!
All work-related costs in Panama will be paid, includ-
ing accommodation. In addition the assistant will re-
ceive a minimum of ˆA£500 towards travel costs (e.g.April 1, 2012 EvolDir 81
air ticket). More details are available from Dr Seirian
Sumner (Seirian.Sumner@ioz.ac.uk) and/or Dr Solenn
Patalano (solenn.patalano@babraham.ac.uk). Applica-
tions should include CV (with email addresses for two
referees) and a covering letter explaining why you would
like to work on the Project. Applications should be sub-
mitted by e-mail to both Drs Sumner & Patalano by
Thursday 24th February 2012. Shortlisted applicants
will be notiﬁed by email by March 1st, and will be in-
vited for interview either in person or over skype/phone
soon afterwards.

Common models for amino acid substitution assume
that each site evolves independently according to av-

of amino acid substitution will be presented. One ap-

the eﬀects of selection for protein folding and protein-
protein interaction on sequence evolution. Several take
home lessons include the importance of considering
linkage independent of protein structure, the impor-
tance of negative pleiotropy (or not statements in fold-82 EvolDir April 1, 2012

Pyrenees VolFieldAssist EvolBiol
Field assistants: Volunteer positions in evolutionary bi-
ology
The Barton group (Evolutionary genetics) at IST Aus-
tria requires volunteers to assist with ﬁeld work on plant
speciation in the Pyrenees (Spain) this coming summer
(May-July).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary dynam-
ics underlying species diversiﬁcation in the genus An-
tirrhinum (snapdragons). Several major loci have been
identiﬁed that underlie interspeciﬁc variation in ﬂower
colour, which is the thought to be a primary driver
of species diversiﬁcation in snapdragons. We are us-
ing a range of ecological, molecular and population ge-
netic studies to further investigate the dynamics under-
lying the speciation process in a hybrid zone between
species with diﬀerent ﬂower colours. This is a great op-
portunity for anybody looking to obtain experience in
ﬁeld work relating to evolutionary biology, plant ecol-
ogy and plant-animal interactions. You will also be part
of a large multidisciplinary team including researchers
from IST Austria (Vienna), John Innes Centre (Nor-
wich, UK) and the University of Toulouse.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students with a strong interest in
working in the ﬁeld with plants. We require people will-
ing to work ~6 days a week with potentially long days
in the ﬁeld. Some evening work may be required. You
must also be comfortable working as part of a team. Fa-
miliarly with Spanish and a driver’s license is preferred
but not essential.We require assistance between mid May and early July.
Length of stay is ﬂexible but a minimum stay of 3 weeks
is required.
The ﬁeld site is located close to the town of Planoles in
the Eastern Pyrenees of Northern Spain. It is easy to
get to by train from Barcelona ( ~2 hours). The hybrid
zone are located at ~1200m altitude in open forest and
all daily transport will be covered.
Food, accommodation and travel (within Europe) are
covered. However, we cannot oﬀer any further pay.
How to apply? Please send a statement of your back-
ground, CV, why you are interested and the length of
time you would be available to:

Software GenGIS 2 0April 1, 2012 EvolDir 83
Dear EvolDir members,
We have released version 2.0 of our GenGIS software.
GenGIS is a geospatial information system for genomic
data that allows interactive visualization of the rela-
tionship between geography, the environment, and bio-
diversity.
The GenGIS home page can be found at http://-
kiwi.cs.dal.ca/GenGIS/Main Page and includes down-
loads, a complete manual and several tutorials that
highlight diﬀerent features of the program. We are cur-
rently supporting Windows XP, Windows 7 and Mac
OSX 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7.
Here is a brief overview of what’s new in version 2.0:
- Plugins for data analysis, including regression, the
Mantel test and visualizing distance matrices on a map
- Support for saving and opening sessions - Expanded
testing of linear gradients: now a user can test all pos-
sible gradients, instead of specifying a single one to test
- Updated interface including new sequence and loca-
tion legends and new ways to subselect data - Improved
Mac version, with ﬁxes to various GUI inconsistencies
between the Windows and Mac version.
We encourage you to try it out and send in your feed-
back, and contribute examples to be featured in our
gallery. GenGIS remains under active development,
and user feedback will be incorporated into the next
release.
Best wishes Rob Beiko

Software OmegaPlus
SelectiveSweeps
Dear Evoldir members,
We have developed OmegaPlus, a scalable imple-
mentation of the omega-statistic (Kim and Nielsen
2004) to detect selective sweeps in whole-genome data
based on linkage disequilibrium patterns. OmegaPlus
has been tested with fully phased data, but also
with unphased data, where we can determine to
which diploid individual a SNP belongs to, but
we can not determine which of the two chromo-
somes carries the SNP. Outgroup information is not
required. The program recognizes FASTA, Hud-
son’s ms-like ( http://home.uchicago.edu/rhudson1/-
source/mksamples.html ) and MaCS-like ( http://www-hsc.usc.edu/˜garykche/ ) formats. OmegaPlus can scan
the DPGP dataset ( www.dpgp.org, reference release 1.0
September 2009, 37 sequences and ~340,000 SNPs) for
positive selection within 55 seconds.
The software is open source and freely distributed un-
der GNU GPL.
In addition to the eﬃcient sequential implementation,
we provide three parallelized versions that use ﬁne-,
coarse-, and multi-grained parallelism.

SSB ErnstMayr Award
Society of Systematic Biologists Ernst Mayr Award
(Graduate Student Award)
The Ernst Mayr Award is given to the presenter of the
outstanding student talk in the ﬁeld of systematics at
the annual meetings of the Society of Systematic Biolo-
gists (SSB). This is SSB’s premier award, and is judged
by the quality and creativity of the research completed
over the course of the student’s PhD program. The
award consists of $1000, a certiﬁcate of distinction, and
a two-year subscription to the journal Systematic Biol-
ogy.
Eligibility: Members of the Society who are advanced
PhD students or have completed their Ph.D. within the
last 15 months are eligible. Applicants may be from any
country, but must be members of SSB, and are advised
to join the Society as soon as possible to be considered
(to join go to: http://systbio.org/?q=node/6 ). Previ-
ous Mayr award winners are not eligible.
Application Procedure: 1. To be considered for
this award, you will need to submit a 400-word ab-
stract of your talk to the Evolution Ottawa meeting
website ( http://www.confersense.ca/Evolution2012/-
index.htm ) at the time of registration. Instructions for
registering as a potential Mayr award contender will
be given on the meeting website. 2. Abstracts should
clearly indicate methods used, conclusions, and the rel-
evance to systematics. Presentations focusing on other
areas of biology (ecology, behavior, genetics, popula-
tions or molecular biology, etc.) that lack a strong sys-
tematics emphasis are not eligible. 3. Applications for
this award will be accepted only until the end of early
registration (April 30, 2012). 4. At the closing of early
registration, a subset of applicants will be selected by
the SSB Awards Committee to present their talks in
the Mayr Symposium during the meeting. All appli-
cants will be notiﬁed about selection decisions by May
15.
Judging: Based on submitted abstracts, the Mayr
Awards Committee (appointed by the Awards Chair,
Sydney Cameron) will select a maximum of 16 appli-
cants for inclusion in the Mayr Award symposium.
The Mayr symposium will be held at a single venue asa continuous session. Talks will be judged on creativ-
ity, depth and excellence of research, and on quality of
presentation. Competitive students are expected to be
in the ﬁnal stages of their doctoral program, presenting
results of a major body of work.
Co-Authors: The talk may be co-authored. It is under-
stood that the ideas, data and conclusions presented
are primarily and substantially the work of the student
presenter, and the intention is that the student presen-
ter will be senior author on the published version of the
paper.
Notiﬁcation of Winner: The winner of the award will be
announced at the SSB business meeting in Ottawa and
again during the banquet awards ceremony (compli-
mentary ticket provided) at the conclusion of the Evo-
lution Meetings, whereupon the winner will be given
an award certiﬁcate. An announcement of the win-
ner will be published in Systematic Biology and placed
on the SSB website (see last year’s winner at http://-
systbiol.org/ ).

SSB Mini-Arts grantSSB: Mini-ARTS Grant
The Society of Systematic Biologists is pleased to an-
nounce the availability of awards for revisionary tax-
onomy and systematics, modeled after the NSF Dear
Colleague Letter: Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy
and Systematics (ARTS) recently developed within the
Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster. We are
calling these ’mini-ARTS’ grants. These awards are
designed to allow SSB members (students, post-docs,
and faculty) to spend a summer or semester appren-
ticed to an expert in a particular taxonomic group or
to enhance revisionary taxonomic and systematics re-
search in novel ways. Goals of this award program are
to address constraints on our knowledge of undescribed
biodiversity, assist in passing on taxonomic expertise
before it is lost, increase the number of students with
broad training in organismal biology and systematics,
and support projects in biodiversity and taxonomy in-
formatics as well as monographic and revisionary tax-
onomy. Activities can include a trip to the taxonomist’s
laboratory, pay for the taxonomist to visit the appli-
cant’s laboratory for a period of time, or pay for costs
of computer time or development of interactive keys
for electronic dissemination of systematics results. Re-
quests for support may be in any amount up to $3,000.
We will fund two or three of these awards this year.
Please visit NSF’s website http://www.nsf.gov/-
pubs/2011/nsf11037/nsf11037.jsp for more information
about their ARTS program.
How to apply (deadline March 31, 2012) A complete ap-
plication includes 1) a brief description of the project,
including a separate section justifying the importance
of the taxon and the revisionary work, 2) an itemized
budget, 3) the applicant’s CV, and 4) a letter of sup-
port from the taxonomic expert or collaborator. If the
applicant is a student or post-doc, please also include
a reference letter from the advisor. Applicants may
be from any country, but must be members of SSB,
and are advised to join the Society as soon as possible
to facilitate their applications (to join go to: http://-
systbio.org/?q=node/6 ). The narrative part of the ap-
plication should be no more than two pages, including
the budget, but not including the curriculum vitae and
letter(s).
Grant applications should be sent to the SSB Awards
Committee ( ssb-apps@life.illinois.edu), Committee
Chair Sydney Cameron. E-mail submissions are re-
quired, and applicants should use pdf format for all
documents. In the subject line of the email, please in-
dicate the SSB award category as ’mini-ARTS’.

TravelGrants SpeciationResearch
Dear colleagues,
The European Research Networking Programme “Fron-
tiers of Speciation Research”, supported by 18 National
Funding Organizations in member countries of the Eu-
ropean Science Foundation, is inviting applications for
travel grants intended to foster collaborations between
European researchers working on topics related to the
Programme.
Support is available for short visits (up to 2 weeks)
and exchange grants (up to 3 months), with preference
given to junior researchers at a graduate or postdoc-
toral level. A typical grant covers between EUR 1500
and EUR 2000. Applicants will want to keep in mind
that, reﬂecting the availability of funds, applications for
smaller grants are more likely to succeed than applica-
tions for larger grants, and that granted amounts are
typically adjusted relative to solicited amounts so as to
promote equity among selected candidates.
Applications are reviewed quarterly after a submis-
sion deadline of 24:00 CET on 15 March, 15 June, 15
September, and 15 December. About 4-6 weeks after
each deadline, the ESF will inform applicants about the
outcome of evaluations.
Further information and instructions on how to ap-
ply are available at www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/EEP/-

UBath VoluntaryFieldAssist
BirdBehaviour
Field Assistant position in behavioural ecology in Cape
Verde, North Africa ? Sept to Dec 2012
We are seeking 1 Voluntary Field Assistant for a bird
evolutionary ecological project in the Republic of Cape
Verde. The assistant is required from 1 September un-
til 15 December 2012. Basic food, accommodation and
research expenses are provided, although the assistant
has to cover his/her journey to (and from) Maio, Cape
Verde.
The project We are investigating breeding ecology and
behaviour of Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinusApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 87
in Cape Verde by monitoring colour-ringed individu-
als. This is an all-year resident population and many
individuals are already ringed from previous years.
The place The study sites are in Maio Island, Cape
Verde, at the Salina Porto Ingles and nearby lagoons
(see the Bradt Guide to Cape Verde Islands). Accom-
modation on the islands is in an apartment, with occa-
sional water and electricity. The island has spectacu-
lar wildlife, including endemic birds, corals and marine
mammals; it is a beautiful and inspiring place to work.
However, the island is a small and isolated place with
basic commodities, the weather can be harsh, and a
great deal of walking and cycling are required.
The job The ﬁeldwork will run from 1 September to
mid December 2012. It will be unsupervised, and will
involve ? among other tasks ? searching for plover
nests and marked plovers and their families, taking be-
havioural observations and monitoring nest survival. It
will also involve capturing, ringing and bleeding adults
and young.
The candidates This is a voluntary post ? applicants
must be willing to pay for their own transport to Maio.
Once in Maio, however, accommodation, basic food
and expenses associated with research will be covered.
Phone calls and internet costs will not be covered.
You will be a keen birder with sharp eyes and plenty
of experience in trapping, handling and ringing birds.
Clean driving licence is essential. You must be person-
able and happy to engage with locals to explain the
project; some Spanish or Portuguese is helpful. You
must be physically ﬁt, hard-working and meticulous,
and have a proven ability to work independently.
As you will appreciate from its description, the project
will involve many diﬀerent challenges. A proven abil-
ity to collect high-quality data is essential (i.e. a good
degree in a biological subject or equivalent experience),
and you should be prepared to type up your data in
the evenings. You must have a positive attitude and
an ability to look after yourself ? this means cooking
your own meals, dealing with logistics, and most im-
portantly being capable of organising your own work
for a long period of time.
If you like chatting on the phone, or feel the need to
text and email people all the time, this position is not
for you. The cost of living is high, and fancy food is
expensive.
Costs It is possible to ﬂy through Lisbon from the UK
that costs about £700. Internal ﬂights from Praia to
Maio should be under £100 one way, and the Praia-
Maio ferry costs about £15.Interested? Please send a current CV with an email
stating why you feel you are a strong candidate to me
(Professor Tam´ as Sz´ ekely) at T.Szekely@bath.ac.uk.
Application deadline: 15 April 2012. Telephone Inter-
views will be carried out in late April 2012.
I will also need the contact details (email and tele-
phone) of two referees. If you have any questions, please
direct them to me at the same email address, or call me
at +44 1225 383676.

cal Association/L’Association Botanique du Canada,
American Bryological and Lichenological Society,
American Fern Society, American Society of Plant Tax-
onomists and the International Association for Plant
Taxonomy.
The theme of the meetings this year is “Botany - The
Next Generation”. Topics range across all levels of
botany and include talks on carnivorous plants, plant
genomics, rhizosphere interactions, plant systematics,
and botanical education. There are also a number of
social functions, speciﬁcally targeted at students for
networking and fun. The meetings are a great way to
understand the breadth of botanical research and ed-88 EvolDir April 1, 2012
ucation, to meet undergraduate and graduate students
with similar interests, and to network with profession-
als in your area of interest. This is really a friendly
community, so please consider joining us!
The PLANTS program (Preparing Leaders and Nur-
turing Tomorrow’s Scientists: Increasing the diversity
of plant scientists) will fund up to 12 undergraduates
from throughout the US to attend the meeting, re-
ceive mentoring from graduate students, postdocs and
faculty, and participate in networking events including
the Diversity Luncheon and career-oriented activities.
The program covers the normal costs of travel, reg-
istration, and food and accommodation at the meet-
ings. An overview of the meetings is available at http:/-

Workshops Courses in Genomics
Colleagues,
An increasing number of labs I work with are mov-
ing towards 454, Illumina, or similar next generation
genome or transcriptome sequencing projects. I am fre-
quently asked about North American or UK workshops
or courses for molecular biologists that wish to learn
about generation and analysis of these data, particu-
larly genome assembly. Most of these are Ph.D. level
investigators but often without sophisticated compu-
tational skills. Could you please suggest appropriate
courses for these investigators (Sanger, Woods Hole,
Cold Spring Harbor?). Please reply to me directly and
I will post a summary to EvolDir.

and Development Initiative (GRDI) project at the
PHACs Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses, Guelph,
Ontario, Canada. Fellowships are awarded initially for
one year with the possibility of renewal for a second
year.
The project is focused on development of high res-
olution molecular subtyping of the highly clonal en-
teric pathogen, Salmonella Enteritidis. The approach
is to use whole genome sequencing to identify variably
present or absent loci or SNPs that will provide highly
discriminatory identiﬁcation of related and unrelated
strains.
With open whole genome sequences of numerous se-April 1, 2012 EvolDir 93
lected strains now available, the candidate will under-
take genome assembly, annotation and analysis to iden-
tify panels of loci and/or SNPs that potentially will pro-
vide the required discriminatory power. These panels
will then be evaluated on a broad range of strains.
The successful candidate should have PhD/post doc-
toral experience in molecular biology, bioinformatics
and computational genomics of microbes. Previous ex-
perience with genomics of pathogens will be an advan-
tage.

Postdoctoral researcher in Ecology, speciﬁcally entail-
ing the ecology and evolution of avian innate immunity,
ref PA 2012/144Linnaeus University is a modern, international univer-
sity in southern Sweden. The university is situated in
Kalmar and V¨ axj¨ o, and has 34,000 students and 2,000
employees. For more information see: Lnu.se. The
school of Natural Sciences is part of the Faculty of sci-
ence and engineering. The research activities within
this multidisciplinary school include the areas of Bio-
chemistry, Biotechnology, Biomedical Sciences, Organic
Chemistry, Marine Ecology and Microbiology.
The Linnaeus Centre for Ecology and Evolution in Mi-
crobial Model Systems (EEMiS) now seeks a postdoc-
toral researcher with a strong background in molecular
biology and ecology.
The research project is centered on ecological and evo-
lutionary interactions between pathogens and host in-
nate immunity in wild bird populations. Pathogenic
microorganisms are a reality for all living animals and
infectious diseases shape the ecology and evolution of
the host species they infect. The co-evolution between
pathogens and hosts can be viewed as an arms race,
with selection on both host and pathogen genomes. The
current project aims to understand how genetic varia-
tions at innate immune gene loci in Mallards give rise
to diﬀerences in susceptibility to naturally occurring
bacterial and viral pathogens. As a starting point, the
postdoctoral researcher will investigate the genetic ba-
sis for innate immune genes and the degree of allelic
variation within and between duck species. This infor-
mation will then be used to link allelic variation with
data on pathogen susceptibility using both culture- and
genetic-based approaches.
The EEMiS environment is a centre of excellence within
Linnaeus University involving larger teams of multidis-
ciplinary researchers. Therefore, the successful appli-
cant will interact with other existing research projects
within EEMiS.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. degree in a subject area
of relevance for the present project, such as molecu-
lar biology, genetics or ecology. Excellent written and
oral communication skills in English are essential. Doc-
umented experience with characterizations of immune
genes, gene function or disease susceptibility is desir-
able.
The position is available for two years. We oﬀer excel-
lent working conditions, a competitive income, access
to state-of-the-art laboratory facilities and an opportu-
nity to develop your career in a dynamic environment.
The position is located in Kalmar.

Lyon Bioinformatics
Dear colleagues,
We are seeking a bioinformatics post-doc for 24 months
in Lyon, France. Please see the details below.
Thank you Best regards Julien Varaldi
Insects are hosts to numerous bacterial symbionts shap-
ing their phenotypes. Recently, we have found that in
addition to bacterial symbionts, heritable viruses may
also deeply impact the phenotype of insect, as observed
in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. In this
system, the maternally inherited virus LbFV pushes
infected females to lay their eggs in previously para-
sitised hosts. This behaviour, called superparasitism,
is adaptive for the virus since it allows it to colonize
new parasitoid lineages through horizontal transmission
(Varaldi et al. 2003, Gandon et al. 2006). Although
this example shows that heritable viruses may have a
dramatic impact on the phenotype of insects, the diver-
sity and distribution of such viruses is mostly unknown
in any ecological system. The ANR-funded project
ˆ aViromics’ aims at delineating the diversity and circula-
tion of these viruses in a well characterised Drosophila-
parasitoid community. This issue will be addressedApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 95
using a virus-targeted metagenomic approach involv-
ing NGS sequencing. The identiﬁcation of heritable
viruses present in this community, their respective host
ranges and prevalence in diﬀerent environments should
allow us to identity viruses involved in the adaptation
of insects to their local environment. In addition to
this exploratory work, the project will aim at iden-
tifying the genes involved in the above-described be-
haviour manipulation induced by LbFV using RNAseq
(project 2). Part of the data are already available.
We are seeking a two-years post-doc that could lead
these projects. The candidate should have expertise in
NGS data analysis in the ﬁeld of genomics and metage-
nomics assembly and annotation (project 1), and/or in
the ﬁeld of transcriptome assembly, annotation and dif-
ferential expression analysis (project 2). Experience in
the ﬁeld of host-symbiont interactions is also welcome.
The project can start as soon as June 2012. If you
are interested by this position, please send a CV and

ModelingPopDynamics
Postdoc: Mathematical Modeling of Evolutionary
Strategies to combat vector-borne disease
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The incumbent will work
on an NIH-funded project that will build, test and
reﬁne stochastic, spatially explicit, simulation models
that link insect population genetics/dynamics with hu-
man disease epidemiology. We aim to develop a city-
scale model for the transmission of dengue virus, uti-
lizing rich entomological, epidemiological and human
movement data sets from a research collaboration fo-
cused in Iquitos, Peru. A major goal of the work is
to predict the impacts of various interventions (such
as conventional mosquito control, vaccines, and novel
transgenic mosquito management methods) on dengue.
The culmination of the project will be the execution
of a large-scale mosquito control study and a compari-
son between observed and model-predicted population
genetics/dynamics.
Our major new modeling eﬀorts will be to develop the
epidemiological component of our model and to use
parallel computing to increase the spatial scale of ourmosquito population dynamics/genetics models. We
are also interested in building simple spatial and non-
spatial, deterministic models as heuristic tools for bet-
ter understanding basic principles, but we are not look-
ing for applicants who are only interested in working
with simple, generic models.
An important part of our project involves ﬁeld exper-
iments to acquire data that will inform the structure
and parameterization of the models, and a large-scale
mosquito control study to provide data against which
model predictions will be tested. We anticipate that
this position will involve analysis of these and other
data, so statistical experience, particularly involving
parameter estimation and/or uncertainty quantiﬁca-
tion, would be beneﬁcial. The person in this position
will have the opportunity to travel to Peru and assist in
design of ﬁeld experiments. Some hands on ﬁeld- work
is also possible.
The funding for this postdoctoral position is through
an NIH research grant. However, our group also has
an NSF-IGERT graduate training grant titled “Genetic
Engineering and Society: The case of transgenic pests”.
Six students in the ﬁrst IGERT cohort will focus on
mosquitoes and dengue. The person in this postdoc-
toral position will have the opportunity to work with
the students and faculty involved in the IGERT pro-
gram. http://geneticengsoc.ncsu.edu/ Qualiﬁcations:
Training in ecological or epidemiological modeling and
experience with development of computer simulation
models. Experience in C++ would be highly desirable,
as would strong statistical skills.

PennStateU Metagenomicist
Penn State University and U.S. Geological Survey’s
Leetown Science Center have an immediate opening for
a metagenomicist (two-year position, with full beneﬁts)
that will conduct species inventories using next genera-
tion sequencing of genomic shotgun libraries generated
from environmental (e)DNA samples. Most of the sam-
pling has (and will) involve the collection of eDNA and
the detection of invasive, injurious, and rare species.
We believe this research will provide the beneﬁts of a
more robust comparison of the invasive or rare species
genomes, researchers involved in biodiversity monitor-
ing will have more robust answers to fundamental ques-
tions such as ?What is the species composition of a
particular ecosystem??? and ??How does biodiversity
change over time, space, and in relation to future envi-
ronmental change in threatened habitats???.
The successful applicant will be employed by Penn
State University (Dr. Jay Stauﬀer) and stationed in Dr.
Tim King’s Laboratory at the U.S. Geological Survey?s
Leetown Science Center (LSC) in Kearneysville, West
Virginia. The incumbent will lead a project designed to
collect eDNA samples, construct genomic DNA shotgun
libraries, and perform sequencing on in-house Illumina
(GA IIx), Roche 454 (GS Jr.), and Ion Torrent (PGM)April 1, 2012 EvolDir 101
platforms. There are several data management chal-
lenges that must be overcome including accurate post-
sequencing community composition estimates, binning,
chimeric contig identiﬁcation and removal; and down-
stream comparative analyses of pre- and post-impact
community composition surveys. Sequencing results
will be used to create a species-speciﬁc database con-
taining annotated contigs and singleton sequences for
many aquatic invasive, nuisance, and rare species. This
BLASTable database will allow researchers to compare
the results of eDNA sequences to eﬃciently detect the
presence of invasive and/or rare species. The assem-
bled and annotated genome sequences (including or-
ganelles), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and
microsatellite markers for each rare and invasive species
incorporated into the study will be made available
via the Aquatic Invasives and Rare Species database
(AIRSBase) at USGS?LSC.
Knowledge Required by the Position
Advanced professional knowledge of genetics and ge-
nomics, metagenomics, comparative genomics, commu-
nity ecology, and issues related to detecting aquatic in-
vasive species.
Comprehensive knowledge of molecular biology tech-
niques to analyze samples of ﬁsh and wildlife, includ-
ing DNA, RNA (mRNA and miRNA), and eDNA
extraction and quantiﬁcation, genomic shotgun DNA
and cDNA library creation, qPCR library quantita-
tion, high throughput (e.g., massively parallel) and
Sanger (capillary electrophoresis) DNA sequencing,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology, restric-
tase digests, and electrophoretic analysis; and skill in
modifying or adapting techniques to meet project goals.
Comprehensive knowledge of next generation sequenc-
ing technology, including genomic shotgun, cDNA, and
paired-end library preparation for sequence analysis
and operation of the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bio-
analyzer, the Roche 454 GS Jr., the Ion Torrent, and

tational environment making it possible to build com-
plex evolutionary models for simulation and Bayesian
inference. You will be expected to contribute to the
computational environment while developing an inde-
pendent, methodological or empirical research project
where Bayesian phylogenetic computation plays a cen-
tral role. The choice of research topic is quite ﬂexible
within these general constraints.
The successful candidates will be part of the Stock-
holm Phylogenomics Group, involving mathematicians,
computer scientists and biologists at the Karolinska In-
stitute, the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), the

Switzerland ModellingPopulations
Modelling large-scale population processes in Swiss
breeding birds
The Swiss Ornithological Institute in Sempach
(Switzerland) is seeking a highly motivated post-
doctoral researcher to model large-scale population pro-
cesses in Swiss breeding birds. The project aims 1) to
develop methods that allow the estimation of survival
and recruitment from monitoring data and 2) to model
spatial and temporal variation of survival and recruit-
ment in selected species to better understand popula-
tion trends.
The main data source in the project will be the Swiss
breeding bird survey (MHB), which has been producing
2-3 replicated counts per breeding season in 267 1 km2
quadrats in every breeding season since 1999. These
data allow estimation of population trends in abun-
dance while accommodating imperfect detection. How-
ever, the demographic mechanisms underlying these
trends remain unknown. The model of Dail and Mad-
sen (Biometrics 2011) enables the estimation of survival
and recruitment from such data. Exploring the poten-
tial of the Dail-Madsen-model at the scale of Switzer-
land will be a ﬁrst part of the project. A possible topic
is also to develop extensions of the model, such as the
inclusion of correlated spatial eﬀects or the integration
of MHB data with other data sets that are directly
informative about demographic rates, such as ring-
recoveries. A second part of the project is the appli-
cation of the modelling framework to address relevant
ecological and management questions. Candidates in-
clude the patterns of survival and recruitment along the
altitudinal gradient in Switzerland or whether particu-
lar habitat types or regions are associated with higher
survival or recruitment. It will be one of the duties
of the selected candidate to identify relevant research
topics in this ﬁeld and then to expand on the identiﬁed104 EvolDir April 1, 2012
issues using our data and the modelling framework to
be developed.
The ideal candidate has solid experience in population
modelling, in Bayesian statistical modelling and is a
proﬁcient programmer in the R and BUGS languages.
Further, a demonstrated ability and willingness to pro-
duce high-quality publications will be an important se-
lection criterion.
The work will be conducted in collaboration with
Michael Schaub (michael.schaub@vogelwarte.ch) and
Marc K´ ery (marc.kery@vogelwarte.ch), which both are
available for further information.
The position is initially for two years, but may be ex-
tended to a third year. The ideal starting date would be
June 2012. Information on the Institute can be found
atwww.vogelwarte.ch/startseite-english.html Applica-
tions (preferably by e-mail) should be submitted to
Michael Schaub (michael.schaub@vogelwarte.ch), Swiss
Ornithological Institute, 6204 Sempach, Switzerland,
before 30 April 2012 and include a letter of motivation
detailing research interests and experiences, a current
CV and contact information of three academic referees.
Interviews will tentatively take place in May 2012.

candidate will have strong interests in plant-insect in-
teractions and the use of molecular phylogenetics to testevolutionary hypotheses, be proﬁcient in phylogenetic
analyses, and have extensive experience with NextGen
Sequencing data collection and analysis.
Applicants should send an e-mail to Dr. David Althoﬀ
(dmalthof@syr.edu) explaining their interest in the po-
sition, a CV, and the names and contact information

Organization
This research project is a collaborative eﬀort of the
research groups Theoretical Biology and Behavioural
Ecology and Self-organization (BESO), which both are
part of the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary
Studies at the University of Groningen (The Nether-
lands). The research is funded by a TopGrant (ALW-

Job description
In many organisms individuals diﬀer systematically in
their dispersal behaviour. Moreover, individual vari-
ation in dispersal is correlated with other traits, in-
cluding metabolism, activity, aggressiveness, boldness,
sociability, behavioural ﬂexibility and learning ability.
Although such correlation structures (“dispersal syn-
dromes”) have been described for many species, nei-
ther their evolutionary emergence nor their ecological,
evolutionary and genetic consequences are well under-
stood. By means of a theoretical approach (using an-
alytical models and individual-based computer simula-110 EvolDir April 1, 2012
tions) the project will address questions such as: Why
are the dispersal syndromes in diﬀerent species remark-
ably similar in some respects and remarkably diﬀerent
in others? What are the consequences of variation in
dispersal for social evolution (e.g., cooperative breed-
ing) and the mating system? What are the implications
of non-equilibrium dynamics for the genetic structure
of a population and for the estimation of pedigrees, re-
latedness and ﬁtness?
The project is designed as a 4-year PhD project; how-
ever, we also welcome applications from exceptional

UMelbourne ColourAdaptation
POSTDOC - ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF
COLOUR CHANGE
A post-doctoral position is available based in the De-
partment of Zoology at the University of Melbourne,
Australia to join an ARC-funded interdisciplinary col-
laboration between Dr Devi Stuart-Fox (The University
of Melbourne), Prof. John Endler (Deakin University
- near Melbourne) and Prof. Warren Porter (Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, USA). We are seeking a highly moti-
vated and enthusiastic person to work on the adaptive
signiﬁcance of visible and near-infrared (NIR) colour
change in bearded dragon lizards. The aim of the
project is to understand the evolutionary drivers of
colour change. Speciﬁcally, the project will assess the
relationship between animal-visible and NIR colour and
colour changes, and how that relationship varies within
and between individuals and in relation to environmen-
tal and visual parameters. The research fellow will con-
duct extensive ﬁeldwork at a range of sites in semi-arid
Australia, and apply a range of techniques including
spectrodadiometry, thermal imaging and potentially
radio-tracking. The research fellow will also learn and
apply visual and biophysical modelling techniques to as-
sess the consequences of animal-visible and NIR colour
change for signalling or camouﬂage and thermoregula-
tion. Applicants should have a background in sensory
and/or biophysical ecology, excellent interpersonal and
written and oral communication skills, and ability to
work to deadlines on research publications and grant
applications. Experience with spectroradiometry, ther-
mal imaging and/or biophysical modelling is highly ad-
vantageous.

PhD POSITION - ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF
COLOUR CHANGEA PhD project is available to investigate the causes
and consequences of colour change in bearded dragon
lizards. The project is part of an ARC-funded in-
terdisciplinary collaboration between Dr Devi Stuart-
Fox (The University of Melbourne), Prof. John Endler
(Deakin University - near Melbourne) and Prof. War-
ren Porter (University of Wisconsin, USA). The student
will be based in the Department of Zoology at the Uni-
versity of Melbourne but will also regularly visit and
work closely with Prof. John Endler’s research group
at Deakin University.
The aim of the project is to understand the evolution-
ary drivers of colour change. Speciﬁcally, the project
will assess the relationship between animal-visible and
near-infrared (NIR) colour and colour changes, and how
that relationship varies within and between individu-
als and in relation to the environment. The project
addresses the consequences of colour change for ther-
moregulation, camouﬂage and signalling, and therefore
straddles the ﬁelds of biophysical and sensory ecology.
The project will involve ﬁeld work in southern-central
and eastern semi-arid Australia, where bearded dragon
lizards are relatively common, and vary in coloration.
The project will also involve captive maintenance of
bearded dragons and laboratory-based behavioural ex-
periments. The student will be an integral part of a
team comprising the project leaders, a postdoctoral re-
search fellow and potentially a Masters student and vol-
unteers.
The student will need to obtain a scholarship at
the University of Melbourne (Australian Postgraduate
Award (APA) or equivalent). Thus a ﬁrst class honours
or masters degree and/or evidence of publishing in in-
ternational peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals will be es-
sential. Experience working with reptiles and evidence
of ﬁeld skills will be a bonus. The preferred starting
date for this project is early to August/September 2012,
but a later start date is possible.
Closing date for expressions of interest is April 30th
2012. Please submit a brief cover letter and compre-
hensive CV with contact details for two referees to: Dr
Devi Stuart-Fox, Department of Zoology, University of
Melbourne, Victoria 3010 - devis@unimelb.edu.au. For
further information, contact Dr Devi Stuart-Fox - de-
vis@unimelb.edu.au.

UMichigan Phylogenomics
Postdocs: Phylogenomics, Quantitative Macroevolu-
tion, & Evolutionary Morphology.
I am seeking 1-2 postdoctoral researchers to join my
lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Bi-
ology at the University of Michigan in late summer or
fall of 2012.
I welcome applications from researchers whose interests
complement any conceptual aspects of our research pro-
gram (see below!). However, applicants with interests
and/or skills in any of the following areas are especially
encouraged to apply:
1) Phylogenomics and macroevolution. The objective
of this work is to generate and analyze genomic datasets
at the species and population level for several major
groups of Australian squamate reptiles to better un-
derstand the speciation process and large-scale patterns
of diversiﬁcation. The ideal candidate would have ex-
perience in generating, assembling, and analyzing next-
generation sequence data. An interest in understanding
Australia’s amazing reptile diversity is also desirable,
but no prior experience with reptiles is required.
2) Modeling phenotypic evolution across vertebrates,
particularly towards the development of new methods
for data acquisition and analysis. Candidates with
strong backgrounds in vertebrate paleobiology and evo-
lutionary morphology or involving the integration of
morphology and computer science (e.g., applications of
computer vision; 3D morphometrics) are especially en-
couraged to apply.
3) Computational macroevolution, particularly towards
the development of new methods for integrating fossils
and phylogenies or for analyzing the tempo and mode of
speciation, extinction, and phenotypic evolution. Pro-
gramming skills in R, C++, and/or Python are highly
desirable, but limited prior experience will suﬃce pro-
vided the applicant has genuine enthusiasm to learn.
Research in the Rabosky lab focuses on three primary
areas: (i) evolutionary biology and ecological biogeog-
raphy of Australian squamate reptiles; (ii) the causes
of variation in speciation, extinction, and phenotypic
evolutionary rates across phylogenetically diverse taxa;
and (iii) development of computational and mathe-
matical approaches for studying large-scale patterns
and processes in evolutionary biology, as applied tomolecular phylogenetic, paleontological, and ecological
data. Our primary conceptual objective is to under-
stand why species richness and phenotypic/ecological
diversity vary so dramatically across the tree of life.
The positions oﬀer excellent opportunities for inde-
pendent research, career development, and quanti-
tative skills training. The U of Michigan has an
outstanding community of researchers in quantita-
tive/computational evolutionary biology as well as
foundational biodiversity science (including many re-
searchers aﬃliated with the UM Museum of Zoology
and Museum of Paleontology).
Applications should be sent to drabosky@umich.edu.
Please include a cover letter describing your experience
and research interests, a C.V., and contact information
for three references. Review of applications will begin
in late March and will continue until the positions are
ﬁlled.

UNotreDame MosquitoGenomics
POSTDOC: Functional Genomics of malaria
mosquitoes
An NIH-funded postdoctoral position is available im-
mediately in the lab of Nora Besansky, Department of
Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame. The
goal of the project is to uncover the genetic basis of a
physiological trait– saltwater tolerance– in an Africanmalaria vector mosquito, Anopheles merus. This pri-
marily coastal species is sister to An. gambiae, an
obligate freshwater breeder that is the main vector of
malaria across most of tropical Africa. The two mor-
phologically indistinguishable species are very closely
related, and can be crossed to produce viable and fer-
tile F1 females. Laboratory colonies of both species and
insectary rearing facilities are available at Notre Dame;
other tools include completely sequenced genomes (for
An. gambiae, since 2002; for An. merus, later this
year). Genetic analysis of saltwater tolerance will
involve two experimental approaches: QTL mapping
based on next generation sequencing, and comparative
transcriptomics based on RNASeq. As such, the project
will involve the collection and analysis of large next-
generation sequencing datasets. The successful candi-
date will work with Dr. Besansky in collaboration with
Dr. Romero-Severson at Notre Dame, and Dr. Peter
Andolfatto at Princeton. The Besansky lab has other
ecological and evolutionary genomics projects ongoing
in An. gambiae; for more information, please see:

Bioinfomatics
Postdoctoral Position in Bioinformatics
A European Research Council (ERC)-funded postdoc-
toral position is available to investigate the impact of
Wolbachia endosymbionts on the mechanisms of sex de-
termination in isopod crustaceans. The project is su-
pervised by Dr. Richard Cordaux at the Laboratoire
Ecologie & Biologie des Interactions (EBI, UMR CNRS
7267), University of Poitiers, France.
Wolbachia are intracellular, maternally-inherited bac-
teria of arthropods and nematodes, with whom they
interact through a variety of symbiotic associations,
ranging from parasitism to mutualism. These bacte-120 EvolDir April 1, 2012
ria are gaining increasing interest as a biological model
because of their potential roles in evolutionary pro-
cesses, insect disease vector and agricultural pest con-
trol, and human ﬁlarial diseases. Notably, in several
isopod crustaceans, Wolbachia endosymbionts can con-
vert non-transmitting male hosts into transmitting fe-
males through feminization of genetic males (Cordaux
et al. 2004 Heredity 93, 78-84; Cordaux et al. 2011
Trends Genet 27, 332-341).
The area of emphasis for this position will be bioin-
formatics and genomics. The successful applicant will
analyze next-generation sequencing datasets obtained
from various isopods and Wolbachia strains to inves-
tigate the molecular genetic basis and evolution of
sex-determination mechanisms in the isopod-Wolbachia
system.
Qualiﬁcations include: - Ph.D. in genomics, computa-
tional biology or related ﬁeld, - Computer programming
skills (C/C++, Python, PERL and/or R), - Familiar-
ity with the UNIX/LINUX computer-operating envi-
ronment and with databases, - Experience in and/or
knowledge of bioinformatics and statistical analysis.
Other preferred qualiﬁcations include: - Experience
working with next-generation sequencing datasets and
analysis tools, - Knowledge of molecular evolution
and/or population genetics.
Applicants are requested to send a curriculum vitae, a
statement of research interests, reprints of recent pa-
pers, and the names and contact details of three ref-
erees. Please provide information regarding timing of
availability for this position.

many
http://www.awi.de/en/research/research divisions/-
biosciences/coastal ecology/events courses/ http://-
en.sylt.de/ Workshop content: Our climate is changing
at an unprecedented rate, and there is ample evidence
that these changes have ecological consequences. The
key question now being asked is whether species will be
able to adapt fast enough to keep pace with changing
environments. Some species will be evolutionary
winners (e.g. invasive species), whereas others maynot fare as well (e.g. ephemeral populations). This
especially applies to marine ecosystems, where climate
change has multi-facetted consequences (e.g. ocean
warming and acidiﬁcation, high rates of biological
invasions and emerging diseases). Despite the growing
awareness of this, very few studies to date have
quantiﬁed the evolutionary potential of marine popu-
lations or the underlying mechanisms of adaptation.
Moreover, with the increasing importance of epigenetic
inheritance, the balance between genetic adaptation
(selection on standing genetic variation) and epigenetic
eﬀects (e.g. transgenerational phenotypic plasticity) in
response to fast-changing selective agents in the marine
environment needs to be reset. In this workshop we
will bring together researchers with a primary focus
on the evolutionary potential of marine populations
to adapt to rapidly changing environments. The
workshop will be arranged into three broad topics that
include:
1. Molecular and quantitative genetic approaches (e.g.
neutral and adaptive genetic variation, standing genetic
variation, candidate genes) to investigate adaptation in
marine populations
2. Abiotic and biotic selective agents (e.g. climate vari-
ability, parasites) that lead to changes in genetic varia-
tion in marine populationsApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 123
3. Epigenetic inheritance (e.g. transgenerational plas-
ticity) as a mechanism to cope with rapid environmen-
tal change
Talks and posters will be presented in a relatively in-
formal setting with the aim of promoting discussions,
developing new ideas, and providing opportunities for
collaborations and networking.

Description
This intensive one-week course will introduce strategies
for applying core principles of evolutionary biology to
problems in medicine and public health, with a special
focus on infection and cancer. The course will not at-
tempt to cover all possible applications, it will focus
on a few examples. Some especially relevant principles
include life history theory, host pathogen co-evolution,
the regulation of defenses, developmental plasticity, and
trade-oﬀs shaping reproductive strategies. These prin-
ciples will be applied to clinically relevant topics includ-
ing aging, antibiotic resistance, clinical management
of fever, endothelial disease, prenatal experience and
metabolic syndrome, and reproductive cancers. This
year’s course will have extensive special expertise avail-
able on topics related to cancer and infectious disease.
Mornings will be devoted to lectures and structured dis-
cussions. After lunch, participants will gather in small
groups for faculty led discussions on a number of spe-
cialized topics such as strategies to prevent antibiotic
resistance, the role of infection in mental disorders, how
social evolution theory might advance new chemother-
apy strategies, how viral sequences get incorporated
into genomes, the role of imprinting in controlling gene
expression. Participants will be in small workgroups
with faculty and others who share specialized interests.
Most workgroups will investigate a speciﬁc topic, for
instance, malignant melanoma, cervical cancer, breast
cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, antibiotic resis-
tance, or vaccine design. Other groups will address
other topics such as strategies for educating physicians,
creating curriculum materials, or current debates about
levels of selection. Each group will develop a possi-
ble research or teaching project, for presentation on
Friday. Individuals are also free to create their own
projects. Late afternoons are not prescheduled, so par-
ticipants can organize their own additional discussions
and projects or pursue individual interests, including
recreation in Acadia National Park. Several optional
preplanned expeditions are available, including whale
watching, and guided hikes in the park.For more information on evolutionary applications in

Basel MicrobiotaEvolution Sep12-14
The Organizing Committee would like to invite you to
attend a 3-day international workshop on the “Evolu-
tion and Ecology of Host-Associated Microbiota” to be
held at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel,
Switzerland on September 12- 14, 2012. The major
aim of this workshop is to provide a synthesis of the
emerging evolutionary and ecological patterns govern-
ing the complex interactions of host-microbiota across
diﬀerent biological systems. We have invited leaders
in the ﬁeld of host-associated microbiota and micro-
bial ecology to share their insights on the evolutionary
and ecological principles that shape bacterial commu-
nity structure and host-microbiota interactions.
This workshop is intended for undergraduate students,
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early
career investigators (100 slots available) who wanted to
be exposed to the evolutionary and ecological concepts
and bioinformatics tools being applied on the study of
host-associated microbiota systems and microbial ecol-
ogy. Together with the lecture, a hands-on tutorial
(bioinformatic tools and approaches encompassing mi-
crobial ecology, comparative genomics, molecular evo-
lution) will be provided on the analysis of complex se-
quence data sets derived from next-generation sequenc-
ing.
Thanks to the generous funding from ProDoc of the
Swiss National Science Foundation and the University
of Basel, we are only charging a minimal fee of CHF
150 for registration (includes 3 lunches, 1 social dinner,
2 social mixers and snacks during the entire workshop)

Germany, July 2012
Dear colleagues,
On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is my great
pleasure to draw your attention to two interesting meet-
ings on “Protein Evolution” taking place this year in
July in Germany. Both events are jointly organized by
the University of Munich (LMU) and the University of
Muenster (WWU). Oﬃcial language of both events will
be English.
First, we are organizing a summer school for late
Master/early PhD students. The summerschool will
once again - for the 6th time - be held at the Abtei
Frauenw¨ orth (Lake Chiemsee, close to Munich and the
Bavarian alps) from July 22nd till July 27th, 2012. Sev-
eral international senior scientists will give general lec-
tures and hands-on sessions on their topics within the
ﬁeld of protein evolution. Around 20 students (Mas-
ter and early PhD level) will have the opportunity to
join the summerschool and present their work in short
oral presentations. In addition, there will be plenty
of time for discussion with senior scientists about the
students’ projects and other questions. Deadline for
application is May 1st, 2012. More information on the
summerschool can be found on our website: http://-
www.eeslmu.de/eeswiki/Summer school 2012 Second,
for more senior scientists (advanced PhD level on-
wards), we are organizing a workshop taking place at
the University of Munich from July 27th till July 29th,
2012. The workshop comprises four main topics: Evolu-
tion of new Proteins Protein Modelling Systems Biology
Evolutionary and Functional Genomics For each main
session, we invited 2-3 international scientists who will
present their work in 45min talks. Short oral contribu-
tions will be selected from submitted poster abstracts.
Overall, we aim for around 50 participants.
This meeting provides an opportunity for experts to
share their knowledge, present new results, and forge
new networks to develop new ideas in the ﬁeld of proteinApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 127

knowledge and share thoughts.”
“Thanks a lot for this great course and the great time
we have spent here!”
Programme This advanced course covers statistical
methods currently used to map disease susceptibility
genes, with an emphasis on (but not limited to) meth-
ods that can analyse family data or a combination
of families and individuals. Discussions of the latest
statistical methodology are complemented by practical
hands-on computer exercises using state-of-the-art soft-
ware. The statistical basics behind each method will
be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand.
With a focus on family data, we will discuss funda-
mental issues needed to increase success in gene map-
ping studies including: optimal study design, power to
detect linkage and association, determining the most
appropriate statistical methods and software, interpre-
tation of statistical results and trouble shooting. We
will also cover the basic principles of statistical infer-
ence, hypothesis testing, population and quantitative
genetics and Mendelian inheritance. Our interactive
and intensive educational program will enable one to
better carry out sophisticated statistical analyses of ge-
netic data, and will also improve one’s interpretation
and understanding of the results. All the software used
is freely available, so that skills learned can be easily
applied after the course.

Graduate and Professional Course Non-Invasive Ge-
netic Techniques in Wildlife Conservation May 19-
25, 2012 Smithsonian-Mason School of Conser-
vation At the Smithsonian Conservation Biology
Institute, Front Royal, VA, USA Visit http:/-
/conservationtraining.si.edu or contact SCBItrain-
ing@si.edu for more information.
This course is an introduction for graduate students and
professionals to the applications, beneﬁts, and draw-
backs of non-invasive genetic techniques to wildlife con-
servation. The course will concentrate on the use of
non-invasive techniques to answer questions in animal
behavior, population biology, and population manage-
ment, with a particular focus on the conservation of
mammalian populations. Participants gain hands-on
experience relating to all stages of a research project
utilizing modern non-invasive methods by working with
expert researchers through a combination of ﬁeld, lab-
oratory and computer-based modules.
Throughout the course participants work through di-
rected research projects, progressing from study design
through ﬁeld data collection, sampling protocols, and
DNA extraction and ampliﬁcation, to analysis of mi-
crosatellite and sequence data using the most eﬀective
and accessible software packages. The course focuses
on relatedness, population size estimation and popu-
lation dynamics; additional lectures address genotype
reliability, research applications for ancient DNA, and
applications of next-generation pyrosequencing.
Many of these groundbreaking non-invasive genetic
techniques were initially developed at the Smithsonian’s
National Zoo and its Center for Conservation and Evo-
lutionary Genetics (CCEG). Course instructors include
scientists from CCEG (Drs. Jesus Maldonado and Rob
Fleischer) and George Mason University (Dr. Christine
Bozarth) and several expert visiting instructors includ-
ing Drs. Mike Schwartz, Elizabeth Archie, and Lori Eg-
gert. While most instruction takes place in Front Royal,
the course also includes laboratory work at the National
Zoo’s new state-of-the-art genetics lab in Washington,
DC.132 EvolDir April 1, 2012
The course fee is $1,500, which includes instruction and
course materials as well as all meals, lodging, and trans-
port to/from Washington-Dulles International Airport
(IAD). All other travel costs and incidental expenses are
the participant’s responsibility. Participants earn Con-
tinuing Education Units; graduate course credit (1) is
available for qualiﬁed applicants through George Mason
University (total fee: $1600 in-state (VA), $1850 out-of-
state). Participants should have previously completed

Tubingen MoralityEvolution
Jun12-16 2
As the application deadline is getting near, we would
like to remind you of
International Interdisciplinary Summer School with
Frans de Waal (Emory University in Atlanta, USA.
“The Evolution of Morality”
Tuebingen, June 12th - 16th
It is a well known saying that “nothing in Biology makes
sense except in the light of evolution” (Dobzhansky).
Thus, what kind of new perspectives and implications
can be drawn from insights of the theory of evolution
for the understanding of the morality of human beings?
Therefore, this year’s Unseld summer school will focus
on the evolutionary fundaments of morality presenting
as lecturer the primatologist Frans de Waal. De Waal
brings forward the argument that the core concept of
morality has already been present in the pre-social ten-
dencies of nonhuman primates. As a consequence he
attacks what he calls the “Veneer Theory”, which holds
that human ethics and morality - established as a cul-
tural innovation - would only be a thin crust masking
our Hobbesian brutish nature.
We are looking forward to reaching all prospective par-
ticipants of a wide range of scientiﬁc disciplines and
ﬁelds of specialization.
The deadline for applications Application procedure is
March 30th.
There is no program fee. The Forum Scientiarum seeks
to facilitate the participation of competent students
from all over the world - limited ﬁnancial resourcesApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 133
should not aﬀect your decision to apply. We therefore
provide participants grants for covering part of their
travel expenses, awarded by the Udo Keller Founda-
tion Forum Humanum. Also, the Forum Scientiarum
will assist participants ﬁnding inexpensive accommo-
dation.

WORKSHOP IN VIRTUAL RECONSTRUCTION,
SHAPE ANALYSIS & BIOMECHANICAL MOD-
ELLING
Computer-based Virtual Reconstruction, Biomechani-
cal Modelling and Shape Analysis are powerful, fast
developing tools for the analysis of form & function in
evolutionary biology, paleontology, physical anthropol-
ogy and biomedicine. The Computational Biomechan-
ics Research Group (CBRG) based at UNSW and Univ.
Newcastle (Australia) is at the forefront of these ﬁelds.
Current team members working on projects ranging
from Virtual Reconstruction and modelling of extinct
hominids and giant bears to the development of im-
proved surgical techniques and vertebral disc and ankle
bone prosthetics.
This year the CBRG is running a workshop in the ap-
plication of Finite Element Analysis, Shape Analysis
and Virtual Reconstruction at the University of New
South Wales - September 3rd to 7th 2012.
Attendees will be given a solid grounding in the skills
required to assemble and analyse 3D mechanical mod-
els from serial x-ray (CT or microCT) data of biological
specimens. The very latest approaches to model gener-
ation and analysis for use in form-function studies will
be covered.
CT data is available for a wide range of taxa V including
fossil species such as the Haarsts eagle of New Zealand,
South American glyptodonts, giant short-faced kanga-
roos and extinct members of the human family tree, as
well as a wide range of living vertebrate species.
Where possible attendees are encouraged to bring their
own CT data or nominate the species or taxa of interestto them so that we can help them generate and analyse
their models.
The workshop is structured to accommodate biologists,
paleontologists and physical anthropologists with no
formal background in engineering; or engineers with no
formal training in biosciences.
We aim to get people up and running on their own
projects. We will maintain assistance beyond the work-
shop to bring projects to completion.
The workshop will be run by Stephen Wroe (Senior Re-
search Fellow, UNSW), Prof. Philip Clausen, (Head of
Discipline, Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Newcas-
tle) and Dr William Parr (Endeavour Fellow, UNSW).
Technical experts from the two primary software com-
panies involved (Materialise and Strand7) will oﬀer fur-
ther assistance, as will other members of the CBRG
team, including postgraduate students.
Guest lectures will also be presented by experts in re-
lated areas including Computational Fluid Dynamics
and Occlusal Fingerprint Analysis.
The workshop is free for postgraduates and undergrad-
uates. A nominal fee of AUD $200.00 will be charged
for professionals. The number of places available is lim-
ited.
Please contact Stephen Wroe for further details:

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of theApril 1, 2012 EvolDir 135
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
