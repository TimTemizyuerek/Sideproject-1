http://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?year=-2014&program=genes There is also an associated
GRS 8-9 February for students and postdocs:
http://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?year=-
2014&program=grs genes This sixth Gordon Research
Conference and associated GRS on Genes and Behavior
will continue the tradition of bringing together both
leading and beginning researchers focusing on investi-
gating behavior in model genetic systems and model
behavioral systems. The Conference and Seminar will
focus on topics at the interface of behavior, neurobi-
ology, genetics, molecular biology, and evolution and
will emphasize the theme of emerging model species,
technologies and analyses facilitating integrative re-
search. Talks will cover the use of sequenced genomes
across established and emerging organismal models
(invertebrates to humans), integration of experimental
contexts (eld versus laboratory), newly accessibly
phenotypes (solitary behavior to social interactions),
genetic networks, and levels of analysis (gene, brain,
physiology, and populations). Bioinformaticians,
behavioral biologists, molecular geneticists, systems
biologists, evolutionary biologists and neuroscientists
are represented among the speakers so that dierent
perspectives can be evaluated. Ample time is provided
for brainstorming. Junior scientists and graduate
students are invited to present their work in poster
format and exchange ideas with leaders in the eld.

EpigeneticsEvolution Dec3-4 4
Reminder and Deadline extension - Symposium on Epi-
genetics in Ecology and Evolution
Epigenetics, the science of reversible but heritable
changes in gene expression has grown to maturity in4 EvolDir December 1, 2013
the last years. The tremendous advancements of tech-
nologies that bring now the analysis of whole genomes,
transcriptomes and proteomics into reach of almost any
laboratory has also made possible the comprehensive
analysis of epigenomes. The understanding that epige-
netic modications are involved in almost all develop-
mental processes, and several examples that show en-
vironmentally induced epigenetic changes have fueled
the hope to better apprehend how the environment and
genetic and non-genetic heritable information interact
and allow for adaptive evolution.
The research community in this latter eld shares com-
mon concepts and fundamental question but is con-
fronted to the technical diculties associated with the
heterogeneity of their models. The French CNRS INEE
has therefore put forward and initiative to bring to-
gether existing expertise and to seek synergistic eects
in the French community wishing to peruse or to initi-
ate work in the eld of ecological epigenetics.
We have organised a symposium with a number of ple-
nary talks and plenty of room for discussion. We cor-
dially invite the community to join in on
December 3-4, 2013 in Gif-sur-Yvette (close to Paris,
France).
Inscription is free but compulsory and the number of
participants is limited to 80.

We are pleased to announce the EMBO Conference on
Human Evolution in the Genomic Era: Origins, pop-
ulations and phenotypes, to be held in Leicester, 1-4
April, 2014.
Molecular studies of human evolution have undergone
an extraordinary transformation in the last decade.
The analysis of human genetic diversity has shifted
from locus-specic to genome-wide, with new molec-
ular techniques and informatic methods, and their ap-
plication in large-scale collaborative projects. This rev-
olution is providing new insights into the human past,
into mutation rates and recombination processes, and
into adaptation and the molecular and evolutionary ba-
sis of genetic disease. This EMBO Conference aims
to provide an accessible opportunity for early-career
researchers and PhD students to exchange ideas and
knowledge with each other, and with key senior inves-
tigators who have contributed some of the major ad-
vances. The meeting represents a dynamic and stim-
ulating forum for discussing the state of the art and
future of this eld.
For further details and instructions on how to sub-
mit an abstract and register, please visit: http://-
events.embo.org/14-human-evo/index.html Spaces are
limited, so please register soon if you want to attend.

Dear all,
This is a reminder for a conference on *\Genetic Re-
sources for Food and Agriculture in a Changing Cli-
mate" *in Lillehammer, Norway, 27th - 29th of January
2014.
The main aims of the conference are to:
- contribute to an understanding of climate change and
its predicted impact on agriculture and forestry - in-
crease our understanding of adaptive genetic diversity
and adaptation - assess how genetic resources for food
and agriculture are aected by the changing climate -
discuss the consequences that climate change challenges
bring upon the sustainable utilization of plant, animal
and forest genetic resources
The conference aims at bringing together participants
from all areas relevant to genetic resources for food and
agriculture in a changing climate. The conference will
focus on the scientic frontiers in this area as well as
create a possibility for discussions from the political
point of view.
The conference is organized by the Nordic Genetic
Resource Center (NordGen, http://www.nordgen.org/-
index.php/en/content/view/full/2/) and four research
networks under a program entitled \Climate Change
Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation in Nordic Primary
Industries" nanced by the Nordic Council of Ministers
and NordForsk. The results of three years of network
activity of the four networks will be presented during
the conference.
The meeting is directed towards scientists, PhD stu-
dents and young scientists, national genetic resource
coordinators, breeding association representatives, gov-
ernment ocials and other stakeholders with special in-
terest in genetic resources for food and agriculture in a
changing climate.

Emerging viruses are recognized to be a threat not only
to human health but also to activities, such as crop or
cattle farming, and even to endangered species. ThisDecember 1, 2013 EvolDir 13
Jacques Monod conference will study virus evolution
and emergence through an original perspective by fo-
cusing on where viruses thrive. A rst series of lectures
will present virus outbreaks in the wild, ranging from
'classical' topics (ebola in humans) to more unusual
viruses (viruses infecting Archae or viruses infecting...
viruses). A second series of lectures will present exper-
imental results on outbreaks, with a particular focus
on bacteriophages, which are particularly amenable to
experimental evolution approaches. Finally, the third
series of lectures will focus on deciphering the dynami-
cal processes that can lead to outbreaks of new viruses.
Overall, this conference stands out as one of the few
that gathers researchers, who use dierent approaches
(molecular biology, experimental evolution, mathemati-
cal modeling) and work on viruses infecting a wide vari-
ety of hosts (animals, plants, bacteria, Archae, viruses)
but who are all interested in virus emergence.

How did our species, Homo sapiens, become what it is
today? How did our ancestors spread across the globe?
How did their bodies and minds evolve?
The study of these fascinating questions has seen a ver-
itable revolution in recent years: genome sequencing of
ancient and extant humans, and their relatives, has re-
vealed our evolutionary history in unprecedented detail
and sheds light on how humans adapted; new analyses
of fossils and archaeology reveal what makes humans so
unique.
Our Cell Symposium 'Evolution of Modern Humans -
From Bones to Genomes' pays homage to this revo-
lution by bringing together an uniquely broad mix of
world-class researchers who study the evolution of our
species from various angles - from palaeoanthropology
to genetics, genomics and archaeogenetics, through to
the study of cultural and cognitive processes.

Woodpeckers in a Changing World - 7th International
Woodpecker Conference Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, 23-26
February 2014
On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we are pleased
to announce the 7th International Woodpecker Confer-
ence. As usual, these international woodpecker con-
ferences aim at bringing together researchers, conser-
vationists and forest managers from across the globe.
The title of the planned conference is \Woodpeckers in
a Changing World", which shows that we strive to dis-
cuss threats to and opportunities for woodpeckers in the
face of global change and debates over forest manage-
ment and energy policies currently taking place at EU
and international institutions. In addition, this confer-
ence aims to promote an international forum for dis-
cussion on how woodpecker research may improve our
understanding of behaviour, ecology and conservation
sciences.
The conference is embedded within an EU-LIFE project
(Pro-Izki) that focuses on the development of actions
for the conservation of the Pyrenean oak forest of Izki
(North Spain) and their associated species.
The conference is being organized by The ProvincialDecember 1, 2013 EvolDir 15
Council of ~Alava and Hazi Foundation, the two partners
involved in the management of LIFE+ Pro-Izki. More-
over, the conference follows the path of previous con-
ferences on woodpeckers organized by the Woodpecker
Working Group of the German Ornithological Society,
which launched the initiative and will also hold its 25th
meeting in Vitoria-Gasteiz. These three organizations
work in partnership to generate a pleasant atmosphere
that leads to fruitful exchange of information among
researchers of this fascinating avian group.

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS TENTH ANNUAL
EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS SYMPOSIUM
Humans as a force of ecological and evolutionary change
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Michigan invites nominations of
outstanding scientists early in their careers to partici-
pate in an exciting international symposium about the
eects of human activities on ecological and evolution-
ary processes around the world. The symposium events
will take place from 28-30 March 2014, in Ann Arbor,
Michigan.
Seven early career scientists, alongside two keynote
speakers, will be selected to present their work and to
participate in panel discussions. We welcome nomina-
tions of early career scientists who are studying how
human activities have aected processes (as opposed to
an enumeration of declining or extinct components) of
ecology or evolution. Potential topics include changes
in nutrient cycling, food-web interactions, evolution of
resistance to antibiotics or pesticides, as well as fa-
cilitation of ecosystem function through maintenance
of diverse managed ecosystems. The research focus
can range from organisms (microbes to mammoths) to
ecosystems in modern or prehistoric times, using obser-
vational, experimental, or theoretical approaches. We
are interested in scientists with diverse expertise (aca-
demic, policy, non-prot, or management).
Early career scientists are considered senior graduate
students (who stand to receive their Ph.D. within one
year), postdoctoral researchers, and rst- or second-
year faculty. A colleague or advisor must provide the
nomination.
The nomination consists of a brief letter of recommen-dation addressing the nominee's scientic promise and
ability to give a good talk, the nominee's curriculum
vitae, and a brief abstract of the proposed presentation
(<200 words, written by the nominee). Nominations
may be sent electronically (in one le, please) to eeb-
ecss-nomination@umich.edu using the nominee's name
as the subject line (last name rst, please). More in-
formation is available at http://sitemaker.umich.edu/-
ecss2014 . All nominations must be received by Decem-
ber 16, 2013, at 5 pm.
Selected participants will be contacted by January 1,
2014, and will have all expenses covered (registration,
travel and accommodation). An ocial announcement
of the slate of speakers will be issued soon thereafter.

We are pleased to announce the Third Meeting of the
Network for Neotropical Biogeography (NNB3) that
will take place at the Universidad de los Andes in Bo-
got a, Colombia, on January 7{10, 2014. The theme of
the meeting will be ^ aSpace, Time, Form and Genes.'
The event includes pre-meeting workshops (Jan. 7{8)

The Network for Neotropical Biogeography (http:/-
/nnb.myspecies.info) promotes scientic interactions
across disciplines and taxa with the following goals:
- Promote scientic interaction - Stimulate the ex-
change of material, students and researchers - Increase
inter-disciplinarity between dierent elds - Discuss
and plan joint projects and grant applications - Stim-
ulate collaborative eldwork and reciprocal help with
eld collection of research material - Inform on upcom-
ing events, recent papers and other relevant material
The NNB was established during a symposium at
the BioSystematics conference in Berlin in February
2011. A second meeting, with the theme ^ aIntegrating
Neotropical Research,' was held at the Montgomery
Botanical Center, Coral Gables, Miami, Florida, USA,
on January 14th, 2013 immediately following the 6th
Biennial meeting of the International Biogeography So-
ciety.
Tropical America - the Neotropics - is the most species-
rich region on Earth. Understanding the mechanisms
underlying the historical assembly and evolution of
this extreme biodiversity constitutes a major challenge
in biology, and will require hitherto unrealized inter-disciplinary scientic collaboration.
We look forward to seeing you in Bogot a!

Ventura PredatorPrey Jan5-10
This conference touches on the evolutionary ecology of
predator-prey interactions, so we gured that it would
make sense to post it to Evol-Dir.
We anticipate the availability of a limited amount of
NSF funding to support the attendance of graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers at the rst Gor-don Research Conference on Predator-Prey Interactions
(January 5th-10th, 2014 in Ventura, CA; see the bot-
tom of this announcement for more information regard-
ing this conference). NSF regulations require that this
funding be restricted to U.S. citizens, and preference
will be given to women and underrepresented minori-
ties. All awardees must present a poster on their re-
search at the conference.
Successful applicants will receive a $500.00 credit to-
wards the $1,000.00 cost of GRC attendance. The cost
of attendance covers registration, meals, and hotel ac-
commodations for the duration of the ve-day confer-
ence, but DOES NOT include the cost of transportation
to/from the conference.
Members of underrepresented minority groups are also
encouraged to apply to the GRC-run Carl Storm Un-
derrepresented Minority Fellowship program (CSURM;
http://www.grc.org/diversity.aspx). Eligible appli-
cants can receive both CSURM and NSF funds; if
CSURM funds are awarded, NSF funding will provide
an additional $200.00 towards the cost of attendance.

In addition to the regular A0 poster size (841 x 1189
mm, portrait orientation) we will be adopting a sec-
ond poster format of so-called essence poster. This is
an A3 poster presenting preliminary data, data that
need to be discussed more informally or are an outlook
of a project. The advantage of these essence posters is
that every participant will be able to present something,
which is important as funding for congress participation
is often available only if something is being presented.

YosemiteNP Symbioses May3-4
Conference: Symbioses (Yosemite, CA)Dear Colleagues, The Fourth annual Symbiosis Work-
shop will take place on May 3-4, 2014 at the Sierra
Nevada Research Institute, Yosemite National Park.
This is an integrative meeting of biologists focusing
on symbiosis research Co-organized by Mnica Medina
(UC Merced) and Joel Sachs (UC Riverside) Keynote
speaker: Dr. John Pringle from Stanford University.
Aiptasia, a model system for dinoagellate-cnidarian
symbiosis
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our goal is to better integrate scientists that fo-
cus on symbiosis research. We plan to continue annual
workshops at Yosemite as this site is both beautiful and
secluded. This will be our 4th annual meeting and we
are now attracting scientists from all over the country
and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in both co-
operation and symbiosis. In the past we have covered
a range of symbiosis topics from ecology and evolution
to molecular mechanisms in dierent model and non-
model systems. We would like to make room for a di-
verse group of people so we will initially accept up to
3 lab members per group (including the PI) on a rst
come rst served basis.
When: The meeting will be held May 3-4, 2014, though
we make accommodation arrangements available for at-
tendees to arrive on Friday the 2nd to provide opportu-
nities to enjoy the park. Since time at the conference is
limited, we ask attendees to submit an abstract and a
preference (talk versus poster). Priority will be given to
those presenting. Abstract and early bird registration
are due on January 15th, 2014.
Where: SNRI has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room. Costs: See
details in the registration page. We will only be able to
accept credit card payments this year.

Impact of population bottlenecks on neutral and func-
tional diversity in South Georgia reindeer
Open to all nationalities
Population bottlenecks and founder events are an
important part of evolutionary process, generating
stochastic variation among populations and potentially
changing evolutionary trajectories. Natural selection is
a weak force compared to genetic drift when popula-
tion size is very small, yet strong selection could over-
come this. In some cases the new environment will
be novel, and local adaptation important for survival.
There is, therefore some conict between the expecta-
tion that genetic drift will dominate, and the need to
adapt. The key question being address in this study
will be the relative inuence of selection and drift for
populations founded in a novel environment where re-
sources were abundant. Two well-documented bottle-
neck events founded reindeer populations on the island
of South Georgia in the South Atlantic, each sourced
from the same known herd in Norway. Extensive DNA
resources are available from all three populations and
next generation sequencing methodologies will be ap-
plied.Population genetics at Y-linked and adaptive markers
in delphinid Cetaceans
UK nationals only
Understanding the evolution of diversity among dolphin
populations is important towards their eective conser-
vation and management, and requires information on
factors that promote philopatry, which may be dierent
for males and females. It also requires an understanding
of habitat dependencies and local adaptation. In spite
of high dispersal potential, many dolphin species show
population genetic structure over a small geographic
scale for neutral genetic markers, indicating dierenti-
ation by drift. In some cases this population structure
is associated with apparent habitat boundaries or for-
aging specialisations. Patterns of connectivity depend
in part on dispersal strategies that will depend on fac-
tors such as social structure, group size, reproductive
strategy, habitat dependence and inbreeding avoidance.
The primary objective of this study will be to make
use of available genomic data to identify polymorphic
genetic markers linked to the Y-chromosome and func-
tional loci, and screen these at the population level us-
ing archive DNA.
To apply please send to a.r.hoelzel@dur.ac.uk your CV
and course records and have two letters of reference
provided on your behalf. Application deadline is 10
January 2014. Preliminary contacts for further infor-
mation on the projects are welcome.

GEOMAR Kiel evol physiol sh
The Helmholtz-Centre of Ocean Research (GEOMAR)
is one of the leading institutes in marine research in
Germany. With 750 employees and a yearly budget of
65 Mio euro its major goal is fundamental and applied
research in all areas of marine sciences. The research
unit Evolutionary Ecology of Marine Fishes is oering
a position for a
PhD student position on \Evolutionary physiology of
sh larvae"
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic
candidate who is expected to contribute to the EU-
BONUS funded project BIO-C3: Biodiversity changes -
causes, consequences and management implications co-
ordinated by GEOMAR (co-lead by DTU-Aqua Copen-
hagen). The ability to work in a team of international
scientists is required. The PhD position will be placed
in the work package \genetic adaptation and ecophysi-
ology" which focuses on physiological tolerance (includ-
ing capacity for acclimatization), preference and pheno-
typic plasticity in relation to environmental factors on
larvae of commercially important Baltic Sea sh species
(herring and cod).
Project description
Biodiversity encompasses genetic diversity, species rich-
ness and habitat heterogeneity. Genetically determined
physiological requirements and phenotypic plasticity
during dierent life stages have major inuence on
species distribution patterns. For most species it is
still unresolved whether or not the phenotypic diver-
gence between ecologically separated populations re-
sults from local (heritable) adaptation, and whether
or not genetic diversity enables populations to respond
adaptively to changes. The physiological tolerance and
preference will be experimentally studied in econom-
ically important sh populations (cod, herring) sam-

ing state of the art genetics techniques (immediate
start)We are oering an exciting opportunity for an outstand-
ing doctoral student (preference for Canadian citizen
and landed immigrants) looking for a thesis incorporat-
ing both basic and applied science. This project net-
works university and government scientists with diverse
expertise, commercial salmon farms and related indus-
tries and NGOs with the goal of maximizing farmed
salmon performance while minimizing their impact on
the environment. The position is funded by an NSERC
Strategic Project Grant sponsored by six researchers
from three dierent universities and will cover a salary
up to $26,000 (stipend and TA combined).
Aquaculture is one of Canada's fastest growing indus-
tries with a total production value close to $1 billion,
but the industry must be careful to balance produc-
tion economics with potential environmental impacts.
This project will focus on improving the health and via-
bility of the particularly lucrative commercial Chinook
salmon stocks. To this end, the project will be based
in the eld o Vancouver Island, BC at a commercial
salmon farm site. The samples will then be transported
to Ontario for laboratory analysis in the state-of-the-art
Environmental Genomics Facility (EGF) at the Great
Lakes Institute for Environmental Research (GLIER).
Gene transcription at loci known to play a role in dis-
ease resistance, growth and esh quality will be ex-
amined using our brand new nanouidic quantitative
real-time PCR facility. Pathogen screening will be per-
formed with the facility's massively parallel sequencer
(Ion Torrent) and SNPs will be used to assess dier-
ences in genetic diversity among the salmon families
sampled.
Join us at the Great Lakes Institute of Environmen-

as Arabidopsis, mosses and ferns, green algae and di-
atoms. An economic exploitation of these results, thus,
stands and falls with the extent to which they can be in-
tegrated into a comprehensive evolutionary framework
of stress perception and response, and the subsequent
transfer to relevant crop species. Aim of this highly in-
tegrative research project is the development and appli-
cation of novel methods for a reliable, automated and
scalable tracing of functional protein networks across

The study of variation in DNA sequences is a powerful
tool to gain insights into biological evolution, both to
investigate the past events which have shaped modern
populations and to understand how current populations
respond to natural selection. This project will give a
student the opportunity to investigate the molecular
evolution of an economically important fungal pathogen
in order to understand how it has become a destructive
parasite. The study organism is Blumeria graminis,
the Ascomycete fungus which causes powdery mildew,
a damaging disease of cereal crops and forage grasses.
Three research questions are currently of particular in-
terest:
1. How and when forms of B. graminis evolved which
are highly specic to dierent cereal and forage crop
species. 2. How fungal avirulence-eector genes evolve
in such a way as to enable B. graminis to evade recog-
nition by the host plant's resistance mechanism. 3.
Which genetic mutations enable B. graminis popula-
tions to become insensitive to the fungicides used to
control mildew in arable crops.
The project will combine research in molecular evolu-
tion with plant pathology and applicants with a spe-December 1, 2013 EvolDir 31
cialist interest in either area can be considered. While
currently topical questions have been outlined above,
there will be scope for the student to develop her or

working with other labs within the lively network of
powdery mildew researchers in Europe.

AppliedEvolBiolNSF-IGERT Genetic Engineering and Society: The
case of transgenic pests. We are looking for three
students interested in applying the tools of evolution-
ary biology, entomology, ecology, and molecular bi-
ology to important global challenges. Genetic pest
management involves the manipulation of pest popula-
tions to suppress transmission of diseases like malaria,
and to decrease densities of agricultural pests. Please
see our website: http://geneticengsoc.ncsu.edu/ Ques-
tions about genetic pest management are technical and
scientic, but also deeply social. We believe students
must acquire both an understanding of the technologies
underpinning genetic pest management as well as an
understanding of the social context in which those tools
might be used. Because no single student can master all
these complexities, our goal is to sponsor an academi-
cally and culturally diverse group of about 6-7 students
in Fall 2014. With roughly equal representation of stu-
dents seeking degrees in humanities/social sciences and
mathematics/natural sciences, IGERT fellows in Ge-
netic Engineering and Society will use their combined
expertise to address specic agricultural pest systems
that they choose with help of faculty mentors. In work-

StockholmU Bioinformatics
PhD Studentship: Inference of protein function from
domain architecture and orthology Stockholm Bioin-
formatics Centre, Stockholm University
The function of a protein is very challenging to establish
experimentally. A faster route is to predict the function
based on the amino acid sequence. This project will em-
ploy several approaches that use sequence features to
this end. A major goal is to understand the functional
impact of the combination of domains in multidomain
architectures by analysing the evolutionary history of
both individual protein domains and domain architec-
tures. This will be done by developing computational
tools for studying domain architecture, and by applying
orthology analysis to entire proteomes. Another area of
study is 'domain versatility', which indicates a domain's
propensity to form functional partnerships with other
domains.
The project includes both development of new al-
gorithms and methods, as well as applications such
as tools and workbenches to enable public access for
database queries at http://Pfam.sbc.su.se/ and http:/-
/InParanoid.sbc.su.se/. The methods include hidden
Markov models, clustering methods, various statistical
analyses, and own developed algorithms. The project
involves programming, data analysis, benchmarking, as
well as application of the developed methods to genes
of particular interest in order to discover new proteinfunctions.
The successful candidate should have an M.Sc. in bioin-
formatics or related eld, and knowledge of molecular
biology. Alternatively, an M.Sc. in molecular biology
or related eld and at least 1 year of practical expe-
rience in bioinformatics research. Familiarity with se-
quence analysis techniques is essential, as well as a high
level of motivation. Computer programming (e.g. Perl,
Python, R, C++, Java), UNIX skills, and knowledge of
biological database systems are necessary merit

Experimental Evolution in Seed Beetles: Alter-

ing Climates <http://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=48934&LID=12 >
Body/text:
A PhD position is currently available at the Univer-
sity of Aberdeen, UK. Supervisors: Dr Lesley Lancaster
(University of Aberdeen), Dr Michael Ritchie (Univer-
sity of St Andrews) and Dr J orgen Ripa (Lund Univer-
sity, Sweden)
{ Research project description:
Climates are currently changing at an unprecedented
rate, and many organisms are responding to these
changes with dramatic range shifts involving evolution-
ary responses. Among the organisms most strongly af-
fected by changing climates are small, exothermic an-
imals such as insects, which can evolve rapidly and
quickly disperse into available niches, often posing new
threats to food security (as crop or stored-food pests),
human and animal welfare (as disease vectors), and af-
fecting overall ecosystem function.
The mechanisms of evolution and range shift under
rapidly changing climates remain poorly understood.
One question relates to the order of trait divergence,
which has important consequences for how biodiver-
sity is aected by environmental change. In a model of
^I-niche priority for population divergence, organisms
rst evolve traits related to their within-community
niche (i.e., the ^I-niche), such as alternative patterns
of resource-utilization, species-interaction, and micro-
habitat use. New ways of interacting with their local
habitat may then facilitate range expansion by pro-
viding new ways to overcome prior geographic limi-
tations. Conversely, under ^I2-niche priority, environ-
mental change induces range shifts (i.e., adaptation to
novel habitats and locales, the ^I2-niche) prior to or
in lieu of local, ^I-niche dierentiation. These alter-
native scenarios each have important implications for
how organisms respond to changing climates over the
long term. ^I2-priority implies limited scope for ne-
scale local adaptation, which may limit the success oforganisms that have nowhere suitable to go as climates
change, while ^I-priority suggests that climate change
may trigger successful invasions and adaptive radia-
tions. Each of these scenarios has been found to occur
in a variety of natural systems, but the general condi-
tions favouring each evolutionary pathway are currently
unknown.
In this PhD project, the student will investigate condi-
tions under which these alternative niche evolution sce-
narios may occur, using experimental evolution under
quasi-natural selection in a captive lab colony of seed
beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). Seed beetles are ma-
jor pests on stored legumes and grains worldwide, and
have been shown to evolve local host-plant shifts (habi-
tat utilization, an ^I-niche component) and range shifts
associated with evolving thermal tolerances (a ^I2-niche
component) in response to changing climates. Dynamic
models developed by J orgen Ripa (Lund University)
suggest that the priority of ^I- vs. ^I2-niche evolution
depends on the relative strengths of evolutionary trade-
os imposed by habitat shifts vs. alternative resource
use, and also by dispersal capacities. We will conduct
experimental evolution of replicate lineages in a two-
habitat scenario with connectivity, where habitats are
characterized by alternative thermal regimes. Within
each habitat, individuals will also have the opportunity
to adapt to new resources (i.e., new seed types). Rates
of climate change within habitats, population densities,
dispersal rates between habitats, and prior adaptations
of initial lineages will be independently manipulated.
Dynamic models of niche evolution pathways developed
by J orgen Ripa will inform experiments, and our ex-
perimental results can rene and parameterize future
models. Controlled crossing experiments of resulting
lineages will indicate the quantitative genetic basis of
niche divergence along habitat and resource utilization
axes, providing a mechanistic explanation for observed
patterns. The project can also be further developed
to incorporate genomic methods for understanding the
mechanisms of niche evolution.
The outputs of this project will inform evolutionary
theory and pest management decisions. The student
will work under Lesley Lancaster at the University of
Aberdeen, Michael Ritchie at the University of St. An-
drews, and J orgen Ripa at Lund University. We will
provide training in experimental evolution, quantitative
genetic and genomic methods, and relevant background
and training in individual-based modelling approaches
for predicting niche evolution trajectories.

Pathogenic organisms that are harmless under certain
conditions can suddenly become extremely harmful un-
der dierent circumstances. Indeed levels of parasitism
vary continuously in nature, with some species shifting
along a continuum from benign to pathogenic over eco-
logical and evolutionary time. One of our goals is to in-
vestigate the life-history evolution of parasites that ex-
press variation in host exploitation strategies, and iden-
tify the selection pressures that lead to the transition
to a parasitic lifestyle. Facultative parasites present a
unique and interesting opportunity for addressing these
questions because they regularly shift from free-living
to parasitic lifestyles. The student will perform labora-
tory manipulations and articial selection to investigate
the ecological and evolutionary transition to increased
infectivity.

PhD Scholarship in Fish Biology at the University of
Auckland, New Zealand
A PhD scholarship is available in the School of Biolog-
ical Sciences for a project on the demography of the
leatherjacket, Meuschenia scaber (Teleostei, Monacan-
thidae). The main goal of this project is to obtain the
necessary parameter estimates required for construct-
ing demographic growth models of this sh species.
Leatherjacket are the subject of a signicant coastal
bycatch shery, but little is known concerning their age
and growth. Consequently, demographic data are re-
quired for MPI to meet its strategic priority of ensuring
that the use of this shery resource is sustainable. Max-
imum age and growth rates will provide important in-
formation on the productivity of leatherjacket. This re-
search provides an excellent opportunity for training in
sh biology in general, and in particular the skills nec-
essary to assemble the parameters required for shery
management, i.e. variability of length at age, length-
weight relationship, natural mortality rate, and pro-
portion mature at length or age. Some diving experi-
ence would be useful, as the project will involve a eld
component. The project will be supervised by Profes-
sor Kendall Clements (University of Auckland), and Dr
Elizabeth Laman Trip (Massey University, Albany).
The project is supported by the NZ Ministry for Pri-
mary Industries and the University of Auckland Part-
nership Postgraduate Scholarship Fund. The Scholar-
ship consists of a tax-free stipend of $25,000 and tuition
fees of $6,014 per year. The Ministry for Primary In-December 1, 2013 EvolDir 39
dustries contribution is half the value of the stipend and
half the value of tuitionfees. The School of Biological
Sciences is also supporting half the value of the stipend
and half the value of tuition fees per year plus the stan-
dard student support. This Scholarship will provide
support for up to 36 months of study. The stipend ap-
plies to full-time enrolment only; therefore, the value for
part-time students will be pro-rated accordingly. The
Ministry for Primary Industries will provide additional
funding for operational costs.
The estimated start date of the project is in Semester
1 2014. The University of Auckland will administer
the funding. Scholarship payments will be arranged
once the student is conrmed as enrolled in the doc-

$26,459 per annum including graduate school fees.
*/Rationale/*: Both climate change and land use (agri-
culture) are recognized as a major problem in fresh-
water, estuarine and coastal environments, leading to
eutrophication (organic pollution) and ecosystem dam-
age. However, although the loss of water quality is
recognized for its impact on ecosystem functioning and
economy, one of the major issues for all types of agri-
cultural practices and land use (classied as non-point
source pollution by the EU and US Environmental Pro-
tection Agency) is that they are not easily measured or
controlled directly and therefore are dicult to regu-
late. The PhD student will measure the temperature
related changes that can lead to eutrophication as well
as study the eect of pesticides on ecosystem function-
ing. The approach optimized for these two stressors can
be extended to other environmental stressors, making
the proposed research of high impact.
*/Job description: /*We are seeking*//*a motivated
student who is looking forward to learning a multi-
disciplinary approach to science. He/she will work
in a team of scientists with diverse and complemen-
tary expertise and learn from dierent elds of science.
He/she will work in close collaboration with another
PhD student focusing on paleogenomics and a postdoc-
toral researcher expert in bioinformatics. Theapplicant
will establish a link between adaptive responses and

UExeter EnvironmentalStressBum-
blebeeParasites
GW4+ DTP - University of Exeter, Penryn &
Streatham Campuses: Environmental stress and sus-
ceptibility to Nosema gut parasites in bumblebees
We are advertising for a PhD candidate to study
the eect of environmental stress and susceptibility to
Nosema gut parasites in bumblebees. This position
is competitively funded by a NERC doctoral train-
ing program at the University of Exeter, Penryn and
Streatham Campuses.
Bumblebees pollinate commercial crops and wild ow-
ering plants. Many of these key pollinators have suf-
fered drastic declines in recent years, with 2 of the 26
native British species having gone extinct in the last
century. Both environmental stressors, such as habitat
loss and pesticides, and infectious diseases can place
a massive burden on bees. This project will investi-
gate the eect of environmental stressors on the sus-
ceptibility of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris to infec-
tions with the microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Nosema
is an intracellular parasite that has caused large-scale
population declines in North American bumblebees.
In honeybees, which are also aected by the newlyemerging N. ceranae, there is evidence that suscep-
tibility to this parasite is under environmental vari-
ation: both pesticide exposure in the lab (Alaux et
al. 2010) and harsh environmental conditions (Martin-
Hernandez 2007) have been shown to increase parasite
load or the negative eects of the parasite on the host.
This project will use the tractable laboratory model
system B. terrestris - which is also the second most
valuable commercial pollinator next to the honeybee
- to dissect the eects of environmental stressors on
the parasite's ability to infect and harm its host. We
will test how pesticide exposure, food limitation and
tempe rature stress aect parasite susceptibility and
virulence in the host. This work will be complemented
by a study of how the parasite reacts to these stres-
sors. The student will determine how the expression of
virulence factors is aected when the host is exposed
to environmental stressors. In combination with the
results on virulence and susceptibility, this will eluci-
date whether tness costs are driven by the host or
the parasite. This project oers the opportunity to un-
derstand how the host-parasite interaction is aected
by environmental stress both at whole organism and a
functional level. In combination, these complementary
approaches may provide new avenues for disease man-
agement in both honeybees and bumblebees and, more
broadly, in other economically important hosts such as
humans and sh.

UExeter EvolutionHoneybeeDiseaseBBSRC SWDTP studentship: The role of population
structure in the evolution of honeybee disease
Supervisors:
Professor Mike Boots, Biosciences, University of Ex-
eter. Dr Lena Wilfert, Biosciences, University of Ex-
eter.
A competitively-funded Phd is available on the evolu-
tion of viral disease in the honeybee. The student will
be based at the University of Exeter Cornwall Campus
but will benet from be joining a large international
group focussed on understanding how dierent move-
ment and management practices inuence the evolution
of virulence in honeybee parasites. The PhD project
will involve a combination of laboratory and eldwork
(in the USA) to study how viral disease prevalence and
evolution changes under experimentally manipulated
spatial structures.
Prof. Boots has recently been awarded a BBSRC-
NIH EEID grant with collaborators at Emory and the
University of Georgia that will carry out a large-scale
experiment that manipulates the spatial structure of
honey bee populations to understand the processes that
underpin and maintain virulence. Recent theory - de-
veloped in large part by Prof. Boots - has shown that
the spatial characteristics of parasite transmission can
have dramatic impacts on virulence evolution, with lo-
cal interactions selecting for lower virulence (reviewed
in Lion and Boots 2010). This important prediction
has empirical support in laboratory systems (Boots and
Mealor 2007), but the question remains whether it is
relevant to real-world disease interactions. Understand-
ing the impact of spatial structure is particularly rele-
vant for managed populations (such as agriculturally-
managed plants and animals), in which spatial structur-
ing of transmission is routinely modied, with poten-
tially important ramications for virulence. The aim
of this grant is to examine how dierent management
practices impact the evolution of virulence of the varroa
mite. Prof. Boots' theory predicts that more extensive
movement of bees will not only rather intuitively in-
crease the spread the pathogen, it will make them more
virulent.
In this PhD, you will use this experiment to ask how
the spatial manipulation impacts on the viral pathogens
of honeybees. These viral pathogens are implicated
in colony collapse disorder and are likely to be as, if
not more important than the varroa mite itself. You
will study how the prevalence and transmission of viral
pathogens change when the spatial structure of honey-
bee populations is manipulated. You will further test
whether this results in changes in selection pressure on
the viral pathogens, using sequence information and in-December 1, 2013 EvolDir 43
tegrating virulence data from the larger project.
You will gain skills and be trained in (1) inverte-
brate pathology, (2) virology, (3) sequencing, (4) bio-
informatics, and (6) theoretical modelling. You will
carry out eld work in the US and laboratory work in
the UK with the opportunity to develop mathemati-
cal modelling skills if interested. This project provides
particularly good training and employability skills as it
is part of the BBSRC South West Doctoral Training
Partnership (further details below), oering specialised
taught courses at MSc level in the rst year, combined
with 2 rotation projects that will complement the PhD
project and provide you with in-depth skills in bioin-
formatics and experimental manipulations of bees. Fur-
thermore, this program includes a 3-month professional
internship that will allow you to gain skills outside of
academia. Please contact Dr. Lena Wilfert for informal
enquiries about the project (lena.wilfert@ex.ac.uk). For

PhD studentship: Genetic Management of the Euro-
pean Lobster
This studentship will be based at the Environment &
Sustainability Institute, University of Exeter, Penryn
Campus, and is subject to competition funding as part
of the NERC GW4+ DTP.
Studies in major marine sh stocks (e.g. Atlantic her-
ring and cod) have revealed unforeseen levels of popu-
lation genetic structuring and local adaptation relating
to temperature and salinity gradients, and to patterns
of ocean currents. Subsequently, the management of
these stocks (currently based primarily on geopolitical
boundaries) must be adjusted to avoid over-harvesting
locally adapted sh. However, management change
may constitute a shock or disturbance in the existing
social-ecological systems, and as such, incorporating ge-
netic ndings into management policies poses signi-
cant challenges. This project is highly interdisciplinary
- rst using transcriptome sequencing to understand
local/environmental adaptation in a key commercial
species (The European lobster), and second reviewing
current management practices throughout Europe, and
assessing the implications of genetic management on

UExeter PopGen Conservation
Disease
NERC funded PhD studentship at the University of Ex-
eter, Penryn Campus, Cornwall UK Population Genetic
Impacts of an Emerging Wildlife Disease
Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are increasing
worldwide, and have been implicated in amphibian pop-
ulation declines and species extinctions. Diseases can
cause major changes to the genetic composition of host
populations (e.g. through selection and bottlenecks),
which in turn can inuence the impact of future disease
outbreaks. Furthermore, diseases can lead to changes
in mating behaviour, which also alters the population
structure, again inuencing the impact of future disease
outbreaks.
This project will use Common frogs (Rana temporaria)
and ranaviral disease (an EU notiable disease) as a
model system to examine the interactions between dis-
ease, genome, and mate choice. In addition to address-
ing fundamental scientic questions, this proposal also
addresses a direct conservation concern, as disease is
one of the major drivers of the current global amphibian
mass extinctions. Indeed, Ranavirus causes mass am-
phibian mortalities in Europe, North America and Asia,
and long-term population declines in common frogs in
the UK.
Using a combination of eld and laboratory approaches,
we will establish which genes are under selection in
wild common frog populations in the UK, and which
genes inuence disease susceptibility. We will investi-
gate disease-induced changes to mating in wild popu-
lations and establish the selective consequences. This
studentship also oers the exciting opportunity to drive
the project in directions that interest the student.
Possible directions include establishing a comparable
eld system in Asturias (Spain), epidemiological mod-
elling, behavioural experiments, and experimental co-
evolution.The studentship will be based at the Environment and
Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter,
Penryn Campus in Cornwall, and will be supervised
by Dr. Amber Teacher and Dr. Lena Wilfert. Ad-
ditional support will be provided by the CASE part-
ner, Dr. Trent Garner from the Institute of Zoology at
the Zoological Society of London. Collaboration with
the wildlife charity FrogLife and the Cornwall Wildlife
Trust will be integral to the project, and interactions
with the broader public are essential as eld sites are
primarily located in private gardens. An interest in
science communication is desirable to facilitate interac-
tions beyond academia.
This studentship is expected to begin as soon as pos-
sible. It is anticipated that the student will spend 1-3
months based at the Institute of Zoology in London
during Spring 2014.

EpigeneticsMammalianPop
PhD position (4 years) to study the signicance of
epigenetic processes in natural populations TITLE:
Coping with uncertainty: the role of genotype versus
epigenotype to overcome environmental challenges
Genetic components often explain only a small pro-
portion of variation in evolutionarily important be-
havioural and life-history traits. Whilst it is impera-
tive that we understand genetic mechanisms underlying
these traits, there is increasing recognition that \non-
genetic" or epigenetic DNA modications generate im-
portant phenotypic variation which can constrain the
evolution of adaptive alleles. This project will quantify
the relative impact of genetic and epigenetic contribu-
tions to behavioural polymorphisms using the bank vole
(Myodes glareolus) as a study system, where individ-
uals face both strong seasonal and multiannual chal-
lenges in selection pressures. Our recent work has con-
centrated on the two neuropeptides (vasopressin and
oxytocin) and their receptors that play integral roles
in social and reproductive behaviour in mammals, but
we aim to characterize more candidate genes that aect
individual socio-reproductive behaviour in vertebrates.
We are looking for a motivated postgraduate who has
strong interest in evolutionary questions and is ready
to work hard to reach his/her goals. The student will
join an international group of motivated people that
has an excellent know-how to conduct studies on ex-
perimental evolution both in the laboratory and in the
eld. The background of the student can vary from evo-
lutionary ecology to molecular biology, as the project

UMainz SocialInsectEvolution
PhD position for 3 years at the University of Mainz
The (epi-) genetic basis of division of labor in social
insects
Division of labor is key to the ecological success of in-
sect societies and fundamental to their social organi-
zation. In most social insects, behavioral and mor-
phological castes are not genetically determined, but
develop through phenotypic plasticity. Division of la-
bor becomes more pronounced in larger colonies both
within and between species. Moreover, behavior and
task allocation typically changes in workers with age, a
phenomenon known as polyethism.
This project aims at a deeper understanding of the evo-
lution and ontogeny of division of labor in ants. We
are interested in the identity, regulation and selection
of genes, whose dierential expression are important
for the division of labor in workers. We will analyzehow behavioral performance, epigenetic signature and
gene expression patterns change over a workers' life and
which factors other than age inuence worker behavior,
such as morphology or experience. Our model species
of the genus Temnothorax are characterized by small
colonies, monomorphic, long-lived workers with a clear
division of labor into dierent behavioral castes.
We are looking for an excellent, highly motivated and
enthusiastic PhD student with a strong background
in evolutionary biology. Candidates should be inter-
ested in combining behavioral experiments, molecular
lab work (RNA-seq, qPCR, RNAi) and bioinformatic
data analysis. Previous experience in one or more of
these elds is desirable.
The PhD position will be part of GeneRED (Gene Reg-
ulation in Evolution and Development), a joint research
initiative of the Institute of Molecular Biology and the
Faculty of Biology of Mainz University (www.imb.de/-
GeneRED). Candidates will prot from an established
international PhD Programme (www.imb.de/PhD), in-
cluding courses and from close interactions with various

The evolution of population structure and sexually se-
lected traits in vertebrates
Sexually selected traits, including size dimorphism,
testes size, coloration and ornamentation, are
widespread in animals. Some of these traits have
well-recognised associations with mating systems
across animals: for example, large testes and high
levels of sexual size dimorphism are more common
among polygynous breeders than monogamous ones.
However, the underlying drivers of, and evolutionary
pathways leading to, mating systems are still debated.
This project will use cutting edge phylogenetic tools to

UMinnesota PlantFungiCoevolution
The Bushley lab in the Department of Plant Biology at
The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will have an
opening for a graduate student starting in Fall 2014.
Major projects in the lab focus on how fungal sec-
ondary metabolites shapes the interaction of fungi
with plants and other organisms. Using a combi-
nation of next generation sequencing, natural prod-
ucts chemistry, molecular genetics, and metabolomics,
we examine the evolution, diversity, and functions of
fungal secondary metabolites, particularly nonriboso-
mal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide syn-
thetases (PKSs). Current research is focused on pop-
ulation genomic analyses and ne-scale evolution of
NRPS secondary metabolites among strains of the
beetle pathogen Tolypocladium inatum. Future re-
search projects include 1) a comparative genomic and
transcriptomic approach to identify genes, secondary
metabolites, and regulatory networks that allow fungi
in the genera Fusarium and Beauveria to interact with
distinct hosts (insects, plants, and other fungi), and 3)
examining the roles of root and leaf endophytic fungi
in mediating resistance to nematodes and other insect
pests.
The Bushley lab is a diverse, interdisciplinary, and
stimulating research environment that values diverse
ethnic, cultural, and gender backgrounds.
The University of Minnesota-College is home to a vi-
brant academic community with strong expertise in my-
cology, genetics, host-microbe interactions, and natu-
ral products chemistry. The university recently hired
4 new faculty in mycology, adding additional exper-

the opportunity to interact with other mycology labs
[Kennedy,May,Figuroa,Bates,Shilling, and Kistler] as
well as strong programs in plant and microbial biology
at the University of Minnesota.
Students can apply through either The Department of
Plant Biology or The Department of Ecology, Evo-
lution, and Behavior which both oer competitive
stipends, tuition waivers, and health benets for full-

UNottingham SnailSpeciation
Funding is available for a four year BBSRC DTP PhD
studentship (deadline 5th January), to be awarded on
a competitive basis within the University of Notting-
ham, to investigate the speciation of snails using next
generation DNA sequencing methods
Speciation on a snail's scale
Snails and slugs are a major crop pest, with a few in-
troduced species causing massive worldwide problems.
They are dicult to identify, and part of the second
most species-rich animal group - yet we have no good
idea of how this biodiversity has come about. This
project will use next generation sequencing methods
to investigate the speciation of snails, especially with
respect to characters under natural and articial se-
lection (e.g. shell colour and banding or molluscide
resistance), and including methods that may help iden-
tify cryptic species. Although the precise nature of the
project will be determined by the state of play when
the project begins and the interests of the student, I
envisage that he/she will use mapping and expression
methods to home in on the genes in question. He/she
may also develop new species/models to study (possibly
involving eldwork in Europe or Asia), enabling deeper
comparative analyses. The student will receive train-
ing in standard molecular lab methods, next generation
sequencing and bioinformatic methods.

plication deadline is nearing, and we welcome all good
applications for review.
Natural History Museum - University of Oslo PhD Re-
search Fellowship in Botany A 3 year PhD position
(SKO 1017) is available at the Natural History Mu-
seum (NHM), University of Oslo. The position is a
fully funded PhD fellowship (Early Stage Researcher)
under an EU FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network
(ITN), entitled Phylogenetic Exploration of Medicinal
Plant Diversity, MedPlant (www.MedPlant.eu).December 1, 2013 EvolDir 55
Project Description:
The trade of plant roots as traditional medicine is an
important source of income for many people around the
world. Destructive harvesting practices threaten the
existence of some plant species. Harvesters of medici-
nal roots identify the collected species according to their
own ethnoclassications, but once the dried or pow-
dered roots enter the chain of commercialization, accu-
rate identication becomes more challenging. Species
substitution and adulteration introduce both safety and
ecacy concerns, but also reect changes in availabil-
ity that impact subsistence harvesters of wild-crafted
medicinals. Molecular identication as a method is a
powerful tool for root product identication, but is lim-
ited by the extent of the reference libraries and unsuit-
able for species of hybrid origin.
This project will investigate substitution and adulter-
ation of complexes of medicinal roots traded in the mar-
kets of Southern Morocco. The objectives of the project
will be: a) to develop methods for accurate species iden-
tication, in particular of complexes of species of pos-
sible hybrid origin (i.e. Anacyclus, Asteraceae; Silene
and Corrigiola, Caryophyllaceae), using a combination
of NGS whole genome sequencing and specic target-
enrichment; b) to identify the drivers of substitution
and adulteration, be that increasing demand, increasing
value or decreasing populations, using eldwork focused
on collection of medicinal root products and herbar-
ium vouchers, interviews with harvesters of medicinal
plants, and market surveys of product diversity and
herbal trade.

UReading AphidBiocontrolBacteria
University of Reading PhD Studentship Project Title:
Understanding the impact of phylloplane biocontrol
agents on insects Supervisor: Dr Robert W. Jackson,
Dr Mark Fellowes, Dr Alice Mauchline and Dr Louise
Johnson, and industry partners Mr Martin Emmett and
Dr Neal Ward
School/Department: School of Biological Sciences
(RWJ, MF, LJ) and School of Agriculture, Policy and
Development (AM)
Overview: Aphids are a major pest of both agricul-
tural and horticultural crops, causing physical damage
and transmitting plant viruses. However, the ever de-
creasing availability of pesticides, and reliance on sub-
optimal parasitoids/predators, means there is a need to
innovate alternative approaches to aphid control. We
have identied several highly eective aphid killing bio-
control bacteria. We now have a timely opportunity to
capitalise on this discovery to manipulate the bacteriaDecember 1, 2013 EvolDir 57
and prove they are safe for use. We wish to determine
whether we can evolve improved aphid killing ability
in the bacteria to enhance the aphidicidal properties -
this is a natural, non-GM approach thus making the
subsequent new biocontrol bacteria more suitable for
use and complementary to an Integrated Pest Manage-
ment strategy. Another key aim of this project will be
to examine the eects of aphid biocontrol bacteria on
insect ecology and behaviour. This will include study-
ing the eects on natural enemies and non-target in-
sects following exposure to aphids treated with lethal
and sub-lethal doses of bacteria. We will also exam-
ine the likelihood of resistance occurring in the tar-
get pest. Taken together, we believe that these ex-
periments, coupled with ongoing research, will set the
foundation for future commercialisation of the biocon-
trol bacteria and provide growers with a new resource
for controlling aphids.
The student experience: The student will have a broad
range of researchers to meet via research seminars and
at postgraduate symposia held at the University. The
nature of the project ensures the student will have an
interdisciplinary training (i.e. microbiology, entomol-
ogy, botany, molecular biology). Moreover, with the
supervisors having several microbiological and entomo-
logical projects running, the student will join a team
working on dierent aspects of microbiology and aphid
biology.
Working with industry and impact: An important as-
pect of this project is for the student to engage with in-
dustry stakeholders through attendance of HDC meet-
ings and meeting industry partners. This industrial
collaboration will provide the student with an apprecia-
tion of the horticultural industry's needs and standards
which will inform the research approach. It is thus im-
portant the the candidate has excellent communication
skills. The student will also look to maximise Impact
through talks and presentations at meetings, workshops
and conferences; publication of research summaries in
industry publications such HDC Newsletters; publica-
tions in research journals; public engagement and out-
reach activities such as public talks.
Eligibility: Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK
Honours Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in a relevant
subject.
Funding Details: Studentship will cover Home/EU
Fees and pay the Research Council minimum stipend
($13,590 for 2013/14) for up to 3 years. The stu-
dentship will begin in October 2014.
How to apply: To apply for this studentship
please submit an application for a PhD in

with Zerina Johanson, Department of Palaeontology,
Natural History Museum, London.
The teeth of shes and the integrated jaw apparatus
are examples of extreme evolutionary modication that
have responded to functional and adaptive shifts within
the wider community. This novel project aims to iden-
tify shifts in biomechanical pressures on adult jaw and
tooth type that is linked to changes in the develop-
ment of the feeding system. Our integrative project
surrounds the core question of how development con-
tributes to novel evolutionary changes in trophic adap-
tation. This project will link biomechanical adapta-
tion of morphology to novel developmental modica-
tions of the jaw apparatus in shes to ask whether
having a novel dentition (e.g. beak-like dentition in
puershes) oers an adaptive advantage compared to
more standard yet highly ecient dentitions e.g. Pi-
ranha. This project will utilize advanced techniques,
including biomechanical computer simulations of hard-
tissues built from enhanced microCT data. We will use
nano-indentation analyses to observe changes of mate-
rial properties in comparative groups of shes linked
to re-specication of conserved developmental genes in
species with novel tooth phenotypes. The candidate
will utilise developmental techniques (gene expression
and manipulation) to understand how the genetic ba-
sis of tooth and jaw development and continuous tooth
regeneration impact the evolution and biomechanical
function of sh feeding systems.

address the following key question: Did both plant
lineages use the same genetic toolkits to evolve these
critical ecological adaptations to sub-mergent and
emergent lifestyles? The student will address this
question using massively parallel direct sequencing
techniques and bioinformatic tools. This comparative
work will shed new light on the importance of the
genomic background for the evolution of adaptive
novelties across land plants. The student will integrate

Understanding the response of metabolic networks to
perturbation is highly relevant to human and animal
health, for example in amino acid metabolism disorders
such as phenylketonuria and lysosomal storage diseases
like Niemann Pick disease. Additionally, novel antifun-
gal and antibiotic treatments being developed will dis-
rupt the metabolism of the pathogen without harming
the host. Thus, network-based analysis of metabolismwill have a signicant impact.
This studentship will apply computational systems bi-
ology, bioinformatics, and network analysis to assess
the vulnerability of dierent species to metabolic dis-
eases. You will use data on the interaction between pro-
teins and small organic molecules to decipher metabolic
networks, where enzyme-catalysed reactions link to-
gether substrates and products to form pathways and
cycles. You will work with bioinformatics data to trace
to both the variation of networks across dierent species
and also the networks' evolution; you will apply simu-
lations of metabolism's evolution to work backwards
in time and suggest plausible evolutionary trajectories.
Ultimately, you will develop predictions of perturba-

can be safely applied.
You will be jointly supervised by Dr V Anne Smith

UVictoria ComparativeGenomics
John Taylor's lab at the University of Victoria (http:/-
/web.uvic.ca/%7Etaylorjs/lab page.html) seeks a
graduate student. Characterizing conserved synteny
(or gene colinearity) will be an important component
of the funded research. Other comparative genomics
projects may be included in this project. The lab
is interested in gene family evolution (e.g., opsin
genes), comparative genomics at the population level
(sticklebacks), and in cancer evolution focusing largely
on gene copy number variation. UVic was recently
ranked as Canada's best 'comprehensive' university
(http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2013/10/-
31/2014-university-rankings-comprehensive-category-

*Graduate Student (MSc/PhD) in Animal and Human
Behavioural Ecology in the Lingle Lab in the Depart-
ment of Biology at the University of Winnipeg*
In our lab (www.linglelab.org), we use interactions be-
tween predator and prey to gain insight into population
ecology, social behaviour and, increasingly, mechanisms
underlying social vocal communication and species in-
teractions. For the latter topic, we conduct eldwork
with mammals - especially deer - and lab studies with
humans to investigate acoustic and (in the upcoming
future) neurochemical mechanisms involved in infant
cries and caregiver responses across species and the re-
lationship of infant cries to vocal communication taking
place in dierent contexts. Field studies probe adap-
tive explanations as well as mechanisms to understandthe behaviour and communication of animals in their
natural habitats. Opportunities for research on other
topics related to predator-prey interactions and aspects
of species relationships still exist.
Ideally I would nd one graduate student to do a eld
study (most projects are planned with deer and coy-
otes at our main eld site on the grasslands of southern
Alberta; one planned for work with subspecies of deer
on the west coast) and another student to work with
humans. I am receptive to having a student with a
background in animal behaviour work with humans or
vice versa. A project will be selected or planned that
is appropriate to the interests and background of the
strongest candidates. There are research opportunities
for Postdoctoral Fellows, but these will depend on fund-
ing you bring or that I may obtain. If interested, please
contact me to discuss this.
Potential MSc students should have an Honours degree
or equivalent (4-year degree plus research experience)
in a related eld, a strong academic record, and evi-
dence of being able to work independently and being
highly motivated and enthusiastic to pursue research in
this eld. PhD candidates must have a MSc or be will-
ing to pursue the MSc degree rst. Fully-funded MSc
positions are potentially available to international stu-
dents and Canadians through Graduate Teaching Assis-
tantships and other scholarships. PhD students would
be enrolled at a dierent university where I supervise
them as an Adjunct. Candidates having external fund-
ing such as NSERC PGS are preferred.
Why Winnipeg? Despite its reputation for a wintry
clime, Winnipeg is considered by many residents to be
\Canada's best-kept secret". This mid-sized city is liv-
able and culturally diverse in terms of its people and
amenities (outstanding music - both contemporary and
classical, other arts, food and myriad winter and sum-
mer festivals). Opportunities for enjoying the natural
landscape abound with lakes and forests nearby, prairie
grasslands to the west and tundra to the north. The
University of Winnipeg is a small, rapidly growing uni-
versity in the heart of downtown and the Department
of Biology is situated in the brand new science facility,
Richardson College for the Environment.

InsectAdaptations
UW-Madison MS and PhD positions on molecular
adaptation of invasive insects
Position Description: MS and/or PhD research assis-
tantships are available to assess how invasive insects
adapt to novel environments. Insect pests can be
viewed as model systems in which to explore fundamen-
tal concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. They
are especially promising candidates to study mecha-
nisms of rapid evolution at the genetic level, as many
insect pests have shown a remarkable ability to cope
with pesticides, novel climatic space, and novel host
plants. While there are signicant challenges in de-
termining adaptation at the genetic level and in nd-
ing ways to forecast future changes, there are strong
incentives (ecological, economic and social) to do this
research. Students will combine population genomics
approaches with eld ecology and manipulative experi-
ments to understand the evolutionary mechanisms of
adaptation. Training will focus on the use of land-
scape genomics approaches to relate spatial and tempo-
ral variation in the environment to adaptive and neutral
genetic variation.

drews) and Dr Ali Karley (James Hutton Institute)
A four-year fully funded PhD studentship is now avail-
able in the eld of community genetics, behavour and
ecology.
The project will explore how the behaviour of the par-
asitic wasp Aphidius ervi is inuenced by the genetics
of its host (the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae)
and also by the genetics of the aphid's host (the potato
Solanum tuberosum). The reproductive decisions made
by parasitic wasps can inuence their success as biolog-
ical control agents against pests such as aphids. The
project will explore the genetic basis of sex allocation
and oviposition in Aphidius ervi, exploring both within-and between-species genetic eects. There will also be
opportunities to explore the basis of sex determina-
tion in this species, and to develop new behavioural or
genetic methods for studying sex allocation in multi-
trophic systems in the lab and the wild. For further
details of the project please visit:

Faculty Recruitment for a Multidisciplinary Initiative
in Coastal and Marine Research
The President and the Provost of Florida State Uni-
versity are pleased to announce a major initiative to
develop a multidisciplinary group studying the short-
and long-term dynamics of coastal ecosystems, espe-
cially with respect to the interconnectivity among bi-
otic and abiotic components of terrestrial and marine
environments. This strategic eort seeks to recruit as
many as nine tenure-track/tenured faculty, open with
respect to rank. Faculty will have academic appoint-
ments in either the Department of Earth, Ocean and
Atmospheric Science (EOAS) or the Department of Bi-
ological Science. Some of the new faculty hires can
be based at the FSU Coastal and Marine Laboratory
(FSUCML).Successful candidates are expected to interact synergis-
tically with research programs in departments and in-
terdisciplinary programs across the University, as well
as develop new areas of interactions through research
and graduate and undergraduate teaching. The sus-
tained pursuit and growth of collaborative, externally-
funded research programs are explicit goals of this ini-
tiative.
This is a very broad search and we encourage appli-
cations from candidates trained in the physical and
life sciences who work on subjects related to coastal
and marine systems. Areas of interest include, but are
not limited to, ecosystem or community ecology, con-
servation biology, invertebrate/benthic ecology, plant
or algal ecology, sheries biology, marine mammal-
ogy, (bio)geochemistry, geology, climatology, hydrol-
ogy, shelf circulation processes and biotic/abiotic sys-
tem modeling.
Successful candidates will be oered highly competi-
tive salaries and start-up packages as well as access to
state-of-the-art research space, instrumentation, high

The LabEx BASC (Biodiversity, Agroecosystems,
Society, Climate), a network of 13 laboratories ofthe Paris-Saclay Scientic Cluster, is seeking a bioin-
formatician to analyze Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) data analysis. In the context of a agship
project aiming at understanding and improving the
adaptive capacity of agroecosystems it will be crit-
ical to establish a link between sequence variation,
functional variation, gene/protein expression and phe-
notypic adaptation. We will gather NGS data in many
genotypes of various species, the genomes of which
harbor a high level of structural complexity, with copy
number variations, insertions-deletions, whole genome
and segmental duplications. The successful candidate
will be in charge of the detection of polymorphisms
including structural variants, of the comparison of
multiple and diverse genomes of a same species
and of the construction of pan- and core-genomes.
These challenging tasks will require bioinformatics
developments and implementation of methods for
accommodating the high level of repetitiveness of
complex genomes. The tools will be integrated into
pipelines and made available to end-users through the
Galaxy platform. The bioinformatician will therefore
also have to provide researchers with advices on their
experimental designs in order to ensure compliance
of produced datasets with pipelines requirements.
He will be hosted by a bioinformatics/informatics
team (7 people) (http://moulon.inra.fr/index.php/-

pacity to work in a team and ability to communicate
with researchers.
Funding is available for one year and can be extended to
three (monthly salary includes health insurance). Ap-
plicants should send a CV and the names of 2 refer-
ees willing to provide a letter of recommendation to

Congress (fees and travel included), and a cash prize
of 250. We expect the corresponding or senior (rst)
author to be the graduate student primarily responsi-
ble for the research and paper writing, and the supervi-
sor will be asked to conrm this for shortlisted papers.
We expect papers to be submitted at the latest within
ve years of starting a PhD project. When papers are
accepted we will ask if the paper is eligible to be con-
sidered for the award, and that all the authors agree to
this. The prize will be selected by the Deciding Editors
of the journal, and we expect the rst award to be for
a paper published in 2014.

Location EVOLUTION 2016Re: Location for future joint annual meetings of the
ASN/SSB/SSE (aka the 'Evolution meeting')
As the new Chief Meeting Organizer responsible for
Evolution 2016 and beyond, I am soliciting suggestions
as to potential locations for future meetings, with par-
ticular emphasis on 2016 as time is getting tight. These
need not be major cities, but preferred locations will:
-Be relatively easy to travel to from within N. America
-Have a meeting venue that can handle 2000+ people,
including 12+ good sized seminar rooms and a large
plenary hall, that are in VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY
(i.e. no more running between buildings). This will al-
most certainly be a conference center as opposed to a
university.
-Have a meeting venue that is centrally located such
that attendees have access to a good selection of local
restaurants/pubs/bars
-Have a range of accommodation options including
lower-cost student residences
-Be somewhere interesting to visit (think night life, cul-
tural activities, natural history)
Portland is a good example of such a location and we
are considering a return visit there in the future (but
not in 2016).
Suggesting a potential location does not, in any way,
commit you to being involved in organizing a meet-
ing should your suggestion ultimately be selected. I
simply want to know about places I otherwise might
not consider. Suggestions should be sent to evolu-
tion.meetings@gmail.com and should include the loca-
tion along with any information you have concerning
the specic venue (i.e. convention center), as well any
details pertinent to the above desired qualities.
The ASN/SSB/SSE appreciate your help.

PlantEvolution
Subject: New Phytologist Tansley Medal
The New Phytologist Tansley Medal is awarded annu-
ally in recognition of an outstanding contribution to
research in plant science by an individual in the early
stages of their career (student and post-doctoral re-
searchers with up to ve years' experience since gain-
ing/defending their PhD are eligible). The winner
will receive a prize of $2000 (GBP) and will author aMinireview that will be published in New Phytologist,
accompanied by a comment from the Editor-in-Chief
and Tansley reviews Editor. The application deadline
for this year's Medal is 15 December 2013.
New Phytologist highlights the importance of plant evo-
lution by dedicating one of its four key sections to
this research area, covering studies from the molecu-
lar to ecological level. Last year's winner, Robin Hop-
kins, is a plant evolutionary biologist from the Uni-
versity of Texas, Austin, USA whose research focuses
on understanding the role of natural selection during
the process of species formation. Read Robin's win-
ning Minireview 'Reinforcement in plants' here: http:/-

Daniel Ksepka (NESCENT) Including Fossil Taxa in
Phylogenies: Advances and Issues December 3, 2013
10:00 AM PT
The fossil record oers a rich source of macroevolu-
tionary data. Fossils can reveal transitional forms that
could not be predicted from extant taxa alone, reveal
unexpected biogeographic patterns, and provide tem-
poral information crucial for inferring rates of evolution
and correlations between evolution and abiotic events.
At the same time, including fossil taxa in phylogenetic
analyses presents many challenges. Currently, there
are a wide variety of methods for including fossil data
in phylogenetic analyses ranging from indirect use of
fossil ages to inform divergence dates to simultaneous
analyses of fossil and extant taxa under various opti-
mality criteria and with varying levels of constraints.
One important consideration remains that fossils typi-
cally provide only morphological data, which can lead
to problems related to missing data and potential vi-
olation of common assumptions for model-based phy-108 EvolDir December 1, 2013
logeny inference methods designed primarily for molec-
ular sequence data. Morphological character data are
typically harvested from from fossils taxa not at ran-
dom, but with an intentional bias towards parsimony-
informative characters (with apomorphies omitted from
matrices). Combined with issues related to sparse cod-
ings in large combined matrices, care must be taken to
avoid spurious inferences.

Tracy Heath The Fossilized Birth-Death Process: A
Coherent Model of Fossil Calibration for Divergence
Time Estimation November 14, 2013 10:00 AM PT
(please visit the website for the time in your locale!)
Accurate estimates of absolute node ages are critical for
addressing a wide range of questions in evolutionary bi-
ology. Because molecular sequence data are not infor-
mative on absolute time, external data-most commonly
fossil age estimates-are required to calibrate estimates
of species divergence times. For Bayesian divergence-
time methods, the common practice for calibration
using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily-
chosen and parameterized parametric distributions on
internal nodes, often disregarding most of the informa-
tion in the fossil record. The `fossilized birth-death'
(FBD) process is a model for calibrating divergence-
time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly ac-
knowledging that extant species and fossils are observa-
tions from the same macroevolutionary process. Under
this model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated
by a single diversication model and arbitrary calibra-
tion densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD
model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We
performed analyses of simulated data and show that
node-age estimation under the FBD model results in
accurate estimates of species divergence times with re-alistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming
major limitations of standard divergence time estima-
tion methods.

Science Visualization Initiative
I am writing to you regarding an exciting Kickstarter
campaign. It could be an important new front in the
battle to improve understanding about evolution in our
schools. If only 3,800 people donate $10 each, we'll
reach our crowdfunding goal. We know there are a lot
more people out there than that who would like to see
the inuence of creationism diminish. The diculty
is reaching all of these people in a short time. We
hope you will support the campaign and help spread
the word. We've got a long way to go to reach our goal
and need your help. You can view the campaign here:

An image of our latest model is attached (Note: It has
not been through the accuracy check yet!)
Perhaps your list server subscribers would be interested.
Background: Darwin's Treasure Chest is the pre-
mier project of the Science Visualization Initiative, a
new not-for-prot organization that seeks to estab-
lish collaborative eorts between scientists, technicians,
artists, and media experts to improve science literacy
through better science communication.
Darwin's Treasure Chest makes digital models of pre-
historic creatures that teachers, parents, and students
can download from the internet for 3D printing, along
with educational content. These tools are particularly
geared to K-12 education and to provide teachers with
fun new ways to teach about evolution and climate sci-ence, two topics that are fundamental for improving
science literacy. The rst fundraising eort of our non-
prot is the Darwin's Treasure Chest Kickstarter cam-
paign which will help o-set the costs of creating the
models.
I am leading the Darwin's Treasure Chest project. My
background is that I was chief art director and senior
editor for paleontology at National Geographic Maga-
zine for many years. The project will include the collab-
oration of many researchers, but our principal advisor is
Dr. Kevin Padian, a well-known evolutionary biologist
at UC Berkeley.
Becauses of the \high-tech" nature of the project, it
will also help students learn skills that will be useful in
the technology-driven job market of the future through
hands-on project experience. This type of project is
also well-suited to kinesthetic learners-students who
learn better by doing and making things-as well as peo-
ple who are visually impaired.
Please let me know if you would be able to report on and
share information with your members about the Science
Visualization Initiative and Darwin's Treasure Chest. I
believe that the topic-PREHISTORIC CREATURES
AND 3D PRINTING TAKE ON CREATIONISM{
might be of interest to them.

Software Uncertain Paternity
Coancestry2 0
Dear Evoldir members,
I have just released a new version of the application
called Uncertain Paternity Coancestry (UPC 2.0).
This programme is intended to calculate the coancestry
matrix for a pedigree when uncertainty about the par-
ents of some individuals exists. We may have individu-110 EvolDir December 1, 2013
als with more than one possible father and/or mother.
Then, probability of receiving an allele from these po-
tential parents has to be divided between them, follow-
ing the approach presented in P erez-Enciso (1995). In
this new release not all candidates are assumed to be
equally probable but the probability of being the true
parent can be provided by the user.
The software also provides a simple pedigree analysis
that could be restricted to a portion of the genealogy
(what will be called the 'cohort of interest '). Aver-
age inbreeding and coancestry, founder contributions,
eective number of founder and non-founders as well
as founder genome equivalents will be calculated, al-
though the interpretation of such values is not clear
when uncertain parentage exists. Realise that although
averages will be calculated for the indicated individu-
als (the cohort of interest), particular values account
for the whole pedigree.
Software can be freely downloaded from my personal
web page (see address below). Hope somebody nd it
useful.
Best regards.

Systematics Research Fund
Systematics Research Fund
The Systematics Research Fund is a joint fund of the
Linnean Society of London and the Systematics As-
sociation. It provides grants for small-scale research
projects in the eld of systematics. The 2013/2014 ap-
plication round is now open. The deadline for applica-
tions is Tuesday 14th January 2014.
The SRF typically supports eldwork expenditure, the
purchase of scientic equipment or expertise (e.g. buy-
ing time on analytical equipment), specimen prepara-
tion (including the cost of temporary technical assis-
tance), and publication costs. Projects of a more gen-
eral or educational nature may also be considered, pro-
vided that they include a strong systematic component.The fund does not provide support for attendance at
scientic meetings, student maintenance or tuition fees,
nor for bench fees.
Projects already substantially funded by other bodies
may be disadvantaged.
Successful projects are selected by a panel of systema-
tists who represent a wide range of conceptual interests
and taxonomic groups. The value of any single award
will not exceed $1500.
At least one applicant from each application must be a
member of the Linnean Society of London or the Sys-
tematics Association in 2013 to apply for a SRF grant
in the 2013/14 round.

Undergraduate education
Good afternoon,
I am sending an inquiry to the Evolution community to
bring partners to our Consortium. My colleagues and
I are in the midst of building a partnership between
multiple professional organizations and institutions to
support Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Educa-
tion and Synthesis (QUBES). Currently, our partners
include NIMBioS, ABLE, BIO-SIGMAA, SMB, KSMB,
BioQUEST, NARST, SUMS4Bio, and other invested
individuals. QUBES was gathered to support and give
stakeholder feedback on the creation of QUBES Hub,
and online social-networking and repository focused on
quantitative biology education. This Hub would link
together the massive amounts of excellent quantitative
biology education material in one place, with the bene-
t of user ratings and tags to sort through information.
I am happy to communicate more specic information
upon request. Please e-mail me: ceaton \at" unity.edu

Reminder: microMORPH Training Grants
Dear Colleagues,
microMORPH is pleased to announce a funding oppor-
tunity for graduate students, postdoctorals, and assis-
tant professors in plant development or plant evolution.
$3,500 is available to support cross-disciplinary visits
between labs or institutions for a period of a few weeks
to an entire semester. We are particularly interested
in proposals that will add a developmental perspective
to a study of the evolution of populations or closely re-
lated species, or conversely, proposals to add a micro-
evolutionary perspective to developmental studies. The
deadline for proposals is November 1, 2013. More in-
formation about the training grants and the application
process may be found on the microMORPH website:
http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/microMORPH/-
grantsandfunding.html These internships are
supported by a ve-year grant from the National
Science Foundation entitled microMORPH: Molecular
and Organismic Research in Plant History. This
grant is part of the Research Coordination Network
(RCN) Program at NSF. The overarching goal of the
microMORPH RCN is to study speciation and the
diversication of plants by linking genes through devel-
opment to morphology, and ultimately to adaptation
and tness, within the dynamic context of natural
populations and closely related species.
If you would prefer not to receive any more emails
from me about the microMORPH RCN, please email
me back with the word3NO2in the subject line and
we will remove you from the mailing list. We will use
this list for occasional updates on funding opportunities
through the microMORPH RCN, and yearly workshops
hosted by microMORPH.

MalariaComparativeGenomics
Postdoctoral Position in Malaria Comparative Ge-
nomics / Evolutionary Biology Franceville (Gabon),
Montpellier (France), Hinxton (UK)
We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow
to join our team investigating the genetic adaptations
to human host environment in Plasmodium falciparum
and P. vivax, the two main agents of human malaria in
the world, using the tools of comparative genomics.
Project description: When a host radiation or host
transfer event occurs, it is expected to be accompanied
by adaptive evolutionary changes that allow the para-
site to complete its life cycle in the new host species as
well as being transmitted from individuals to individu-
als in this new host species. Identication of the posi-
tions in the parasite genome underlying the dierences
between host-specic lineages may provide information
about the molecular basis for species-specic adapta-
tion. Our objective is to identify regions of the genome
that have been subject to lineage specic evolution over
the history of P. falciparum as well as P. vivax in hu-
mans and that may have played a role in the adaptation
of the pathogen to this host. We will use the tools of
comparative genomics to detect these genomic regions122 EvolDir December 1, 2013
by comparing the genomes of P. falciparum and P. vi-
vax to the genome of their most closely related species.
This will include in particular the genome of P. praefal-
ciparum which was recently discovered in gorillas and
the P. vivax sylvatic clade which was also recently dis-
covered in great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas). Ge-
nomic data are already available for immediate start of
the analysis.
Research environment: The postdoctoral fellow will
work directly in the group of Dr Franck Prugnolle
in close collaboration with Dr Thomas Otto and Dr
Mathew Berriman (Sanger Institute, UK), Dr Fran cois
Renaud (CNRS, France, Laboratory MIVEGEC) and
Dr Benjamin Ollomo (CIRMF, Gabon). For the rst
year, at least, the post-doctoral fellow will be based in
Gabon at the International Center for Medical Research
in Franceville but missions in Europe will be done for
data analyses. The CIRMF comprises 15 researchers of
dierent nationalities, working on a variety of key issues
in parasitology, including the study of emerging dis-
eases, entomology, ecology and evolution. The Sanger
Institute is an institute of reference for comparative ge-
nomics. The Laboratory MIVEGEC in Montpellier is
considered as a laboratory of excellence for the study
of host / parasite systems and interactions.
Qualications: A PhD degree in Evolutionary Biology
/ Evolutionary genetics is required. The PhD degree
should have been awarded no more than two years prior
to the date of application. The applicant should be
well acquainted with theories in evolution and pop-
ulation genetics and genomics. Ability to manage a
laboratory research project is also required. Docu-
mented experience in genomics, programming, statis-
tics and parasitology will also be highly valued. The
candidate must have a good knowledge of English. Se-
lection will be based on the written application, CV,
personal references and an interview. For more infor-
mation, please contact Dr Franck Prugnolle by email
(franck.prugnolle@ird.fr).
Form of employment: Temporary employment for 2
years.
Place of work: Franceville (Gabon) for at least a year.
Then possibility to be located in Montpellier (France,
Laboratory MIVEGEC, IRD).
^A Starting date: As soon as possible. Application:
Please submit your application to Dr Franck Prug-
nolle (franck.prugnolle@ird.fr) and Dr Thomas Otto

>From Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network
Executive Committee
Subject Call for FY14 MarineGEO Postdoctoral Fel-
lowship Proposals
Submission Deadline: 15 January 2014
The Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network
(TMON) is the rst network of marine observatories fo-
cused on global-scale, long-term study of coastal biodi-
versity and ecosystems using standardized approaches.
The network is a developing partnership of diverse
organizations facilitating long-term interdisciplinary,
comparative research. TMON currently includes the
Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewa-
ter, Maryland (SERC), the Smithsonian Marine Sta-
tion at Ft. Pierce, Florida (SMSFP), the Carrie BowCay Marine Field Station (CCRE Program-Belize), and
sites on both Caribbean and Pacic sides of Panama
administered by the Smithsonian Tropical Research In-
stitute, Panama (STRI). Additional partner sites are
under development. TMON invites research proposals
for a Postdoctoral Fellowship that will complement our
developing comparative research program.
Eligibility and Award Amount. Postdoctoral scien-
tists must collaborate directly with Smithsonian sci-
entists as named sponsors (see Smithsonian Marine
Research Sta athttp://www.si.edu/marinescience/-
sta.htm) and must select co-Advisors from more than
one SI unit (NMNH, SMSFP, SERC, STRI, NZP).
Stipend is $45,000 per year with an allowance for health
insurance, travel to the Smithsonian host facility, re-
search travel and supplies, up to a total $60,000 maxi-
mum per year. Awards will be made for a maximum of
two years, pending rst-year performance review. Pro-
posals must focus on comparative research involving
at least two TMON facilities. Applicants must have
completed the Ph.D. degree before commencing the fel-
lowship. Individuals who have been employees at the
Smithsonian Institution within the previous year are
not eligible.
TMON research. TMON is dedicated to understand-
ing change in the biodiversity, structure, and func-
tioning of marine ecosystems, at local through global
scales. The research aims to advance scientic capac-
ity for forecasting change and to inform appropriate
policy. A cornerstone of TMON is the use of standard-
ized, repeated measurements and experiments, main-
tained over decades, conducted across the Smithsoni-
ans marine laboratories and an expanding global net-
work of diverse partnerships. This approach is designed
to achieve rigorous comparisons among sites, to under-
stand underlying variation, and to assess links between
local and global biodiversity, environmental and eco-
logical change. We seek applications for independent
Postdoctoral research projects that address at least one
of TMONs overarching research themes:
1. How does marine biodiversity vary through space
and time across the globe? 2. How do natural and
human forces (e.g. shing, land-use, invasions, habitat
loss) drive changes in marine biodiversity and ecosys-
tem functioning and resilience? 3. What are the conse-
quences for human well-being of these changes in ma-
rine ecosystems? 4. How does anthropogenic alter-
ation of carbon cycles aect coastal marine systems and
ecosystem service provision? 5. How are marine ecosys-
tem connected via dispersal and metapopulation dy-
namics, and how do these connections aect responses
to change and human well-being? 6. How do nearshore
food webs change through space and time? 7. How can128 EvolDir December 1, 2013
the pastXancient through historicXhelp us understand
the consequences of local human activities and global
change? 8. Where are the critical tipping points that
lead to rapid and unwanted shifts in marine ecosystems,
and how can these best be avoided?
Proposal submission. Prospective applicants are
strongly encouraged to consult with Smithsonian sta
scientists prior to proposal submission. Proposals must
be submitted electronically as a single PDF by 15 Jan-
uary 2014 at midnight EST to stonem@si.edu. Two
non-Smithsonian referees must be identied and sub-
mit letters of support to the same site by 15 January
2014.
Proposal Review and Award Notication. Proposals
will be peer-reviewed by a panel of Smithsonian scien-
tists for scientic merit, project feasibility and appro-
priateness match with TMON goals. Award notica-
tion will be forwarded electronically by 15 April 2014

At Trier University's 'Trier Center for Sustainable Sys-

January 2014 to 31 December 2016
in the eld \wind power inside forests versus bat pro-
tection - development of prognostic tools for estimating
threats to bat populations by wind turbines".
The issue of wind energy versus biodiversity is highly
relevant. Te estimated land requirements for wind en-
ergy plants within forest stands (Rhineland-Palatinate
for instance wants to use 2% of its total forest area
for generating wind energy) fosters a lasting conict
with other values added such as the timber industry,
local recreation, tourism and biodiversity (particularly
birds and bats). In the framework of the European
Natura 2000 network, there are clear legal regulations
for the latter subject of conservation, which could be
compromised to an uncertain extent through the devel-
opment of wind energy plants in the forest. Within the
scope of the advertised postdoc position a population
model of the threat to bats should be developed. Here-
with a deterministic model of \crash fatalities" at wind
turbines (in cooperation with the department of math-
ematics) should be linked to a stochastic population
model. A spatially explicit three-dimensional small-
scale modelling of the wind eld within the range of
wind energy plants to optimize crash fatality prognoses
of present as well as future wind regimes (in the next
60-90 years; in cooperation with the department of en-
vironmental meteorology) is supposed to enable us to
derive prot analysis of wind energy plants with dif-
ferent rotor heights and involving switcho-algorithms
used for bat conservation.
The applicants should be qualied in the eld of
stochastic, individual based, population modelling,

UAkron Ohio EvolutionColoration
A post-doctoral position in mechanisms and/or evolu-
tion of animal coloration is available in the Shawkey lab
at the University of Akron in Ohio, USA. We are ex-
amining how pigments and organization of tissue at the
nanostructural scale in feathers and eggs contributes to
their optical (coloration, iridescence) and non-optical
(tensile strength, hydrophobicity, etc.) properties. In
turn, we are examining how these properties may af-
fect their evolution, particularly in regards to sexual
selection and brood parasitism.
Specic projects will depend on the interests of the
post-doc, but will likely involve use of electron and
light microscopy, chemical analyses (Raman, mass spec,
etc.), spectrophotometry, phylogenetic and/or optical
modeling and potentially some eldwork with brood

the University of Arizona in Tucson, on one of the two
projects described below. A popular tourist destination
surrounded on all four sides by mountainous national
and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city of nearly a
million people with an attractive climate. The EEB
department in Tucson was ranked in the top 10 by US
News & World Report.
The Masel group's main research interests http:/-
/www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel/research/-

mixture of analytical theory, bioinformatic and sim-
ulation approaches. One position (on either project)
is available immediately, a second is contingent on
pending funding. The available position is renewable
over multiple years.
The rst project will study evolutionary rescue in the
presence of clonal interference, via a model of asexual
population genetics (based on Desai & Fisher 2007).
This model will be modied so that genotypes specify
absolute tness in a deteriorating environment, rather
than relative tness as is the norm in population genet-
ics. The project will explore the integration of density-
dependence terms r and K with the classical population
genetics tness term of w, as part of an eco-evo the-
oretical synthesis. A strong quantitative background
together with computational and/or modeling experi-
ence is required. A background in evolutionary and/or
ecological theory is strongly preferred.
The second project involves completing the implemen-
tation of a computational model of transcriptional net-
works that is both realistic enough to be related to yeast
data and simple enough for evolution to be rapidly sim-
ulated. The model will then be used to study a range
of questions, including network topology and the evo-
lution of robustness/canalization to mutation, to the
environment, and to the stochasticity associated with
small numbers of molecules in cells. Excellent scienticDecember 1, 2013 EvolDir 131

UFlorida Phylogenetics
Post-doc in phylogenetics A post-doc position is
available at the University of Florida (Gainesville,
Florida) to work with Rebecca Kimball (http://-
people.biology.u.edu/rkimball) and Edward Braun
(http://people.biology.u.edu/ebraun) on the phy-
logeny and evolution of the Galliformes. The orderGalliformes includes the two most economically impor-
tant birds (the chicken and turkey; both with complete
genomes), some of the most spectacular and recogniz-
able birds (such as peafowl and pheasants), and some
of the most important avian model systems (e.g., the
chicken and Japanese quail). Despite intensive research
on galliforms in many areas, their evolutionary relation-
ships remain poorly resolved. This project is partially
completed. We already have a large amount of data col-
lected, including a large number of loci (ultra conserved
elements) for a set of backbone taxa, and a smaller set
of loci (nuclear introns and mitochondrial data) that
we are collecting for the majority of species. One prob-
lem is this group arises from several rapid radiations
at dierent evolutionary depths, and the collection of
data from large numbers of loci will allow us to explore
factors aecting resolution of these dicult phyloge-
netic problems. The data matrix will also allow exam-
ination of patterns of avian molecular evolution, com-
plementing existing information available from mam-
mals, while the resulting phylogeny should benet com-
parative studies.Candidates should have completed a
PhD (or will very soon) and have a good knowledge of
phylogenetics. Ideal candidates will also have a back-
ground in computational phylogenetics or experience
in managing and analyzing large phylogenetic datasets.
Knowledge of birds (particularly galliforms) is not re-
quired (but always a plus). We anticipate publications
that are focused on using empirical and simulated data
to explore questions in phylogenetic methodology and
molecular evolution, as well as those focused on taxo-
nomic questions. Up to 1.5 years of funding is available.
Questions and applications should be addressed to Re-

4-year Post Doc position in the research project
\Opportunistic pathogens: virulence, disease dynamics

We oer a 4-year Post Doctoral position to a theoreti-
cally oriented researcher.December 1, 2013 EvolDir 137
The person will work on the theory of epidemics. The
emphasis of the work is in developing and analyzing
the models of disease dynamics. The central idea of
the study is the observation that many pathogens are
able to survive and grow in the outside-host environ-
ment, e.g., via saprotrophism. The project develops
the theory starting from a largely unfamiliar viewpoint
where pathogen eco-evolutionary dynamics is modeled
assuming that the pathogen is embedded within a re-
alistic food web where the organism has to face e.g.
the predators and parasites, and resource competition.
The project is headed by professor Veijo Kaitala. The
work will be done in the Helsinki University Integra-
tive Ecology research group addressing themes in eco-
logical and evolutionary population dynamics such as
epidemiology, spatial population dynamics, community
dynamics, and sheries.
We expect that the candidate is experienced in pro-
gramming and dynamical modelling. Experience in
MatLab or R softwares/languages are appreciated.
Applications: We ask applicants to send CV (including
possible list of publications), a letter of intent explic-
itly stating previous programming and statistical expe-
rience, and 1-2 letters of references.
Applications are due 1.10.2013 and should be sent by

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF PARASITE CO-
INFECTIONS
We are looking for candidates to ll a postdoctoral po-
sition in a project exploring responses of parasites and
their hosts to multiple parasite species and genotype
infections. The position is funded by the Academy of
Finland.Wild hosts are typically infected with a range of par-
asite species and genotypes of one species at the same
time. This has signicant implications for parasite-
parasite interactions (one factor underlying parasite
virulence) and for host's ability to defend itself against
infections. These associations may also be subjected to
considerable variation depending on the stage of a par-
asite life cycle. This is particularly true for parasites
with complex life cycles that include several consecutive
hosts with dierent conditions for co-infections in each.
However, very little is currently known about these in-
teractions in natural host-parasite systems. Currently,
we focus on
the role of antagonistic and facilitative parasite inter-
actions in shaping co-infection dynamics
the role of host responses in determining the outcome
of multiple infections
the inuence of spatiotemporal dynamics of host-
parasite interactions on patterns of parasite community
assembly
Considerable latitude in specic research questions will
be given according to personal interests of the candi-
date.
As a study system we use mainly trematodes with
complex life cycles including multiple consecutive host
species.
A successful candidate will have a PhD in evolution-
ary biology, ecology, parasitology, or related eld. We
are seeking for a highly motivated person with problem
solving skills, experience of experimental work, and a
record of successful publications.

The Department of Mathematics at the University of
Surrey invites applications from enthusiastic and well-
qualied students for a PhD studentship in the Quan-
titative Genetics of Maternal Eects.
Maternal eects can be described as the eects of
a mother's phenotype on her ospring's phenotype
through pathways other than direct genetic trans-
mission, for example through epigenetic changes in
the DNA, resource transmission in the womb, or be-
havioural responses to ospring behaviour. The aim of
this project is to develop quantitative genetics models
of the evolution of maternal eects in response to en-
vironmental change and examine the interplay between
maternal eects and within-generation phenotypic plas-
ticity.
The project will be supervised by Prof Rebecca Hoyle
in the Biosystems Group. The successful candidate will
join this group which has an excellent international
reputation and a lively community of PhD students
and postdoctoral researchers. Academic members of
the group have extensive collaborations and links with
other research institutions from around the globe as
well as world-leading industries.
In general, the Department of Mathematics hosts four
vibrant and highly rated research groups with inter-
ests focusing on themes on the interface between pure
and applied mathematics. In the latest Research As-
sessment Exercise (RAE), the Department was ranked
7th out of 42 in the UK for its world-leading research
outputs.

FlycatcherEvolutionGenomics
Flycatcher evolution and genomics
Several postdoc positions at the Evolutionary Biology
Centre, Uppsala University in the group of Prof Hans
Ellegren
Each position is for two years with the possibility of
extension for two more years
We run a long-term project using ycatchers as models
for studying e.g. speciation genetics, population ge-
nomics and the genetic architecture of traits. We re-
cently sequenced and assembled the ycatcher genome,
and performed genome-wide re-sequencing of multiple
individuals of the two closely related species, collared
ycatcher and pied ycatcher (Nature 2012 491:756-
760; PLoS Genetics 2013 9(11):e1003942). By this we
identied a number of 'divergence islands', where we
now seek to explain the underlying forces causing a
heterogenous landscape of genome divergence. The ac-
cess to the ycatcher genome sequence also oers an
excellent platform for many other types of evolution-
ary genetic analyses. Augmented with resources such
as extensive re-sequencing data from population sam-
ples, transcriptome data from multiple tissues, geno-
type data from a SNP chip and linkage map data,we are interested in questions such as the evolution
of gene expression, demographic inference, po pulation
genomics including recombination rate variation, and
GWAS approaches for studying genetic architectures.
Using genome-wide ycatcher polymorphism data in
combination with genome sequence data from many
other bird species, i.e. contrasting diversity and di-
vergence data, we also study molecular evolution. We
now seek new post-docs to join this long-term project
where successful candidates will have the possibility to
choose among several possible directions of research, or
add own perspectives and ideas, in dialogue with the
host.
The venue for these positions, the Evolutionary Biology
Centre, is situated in recently-built localities in cen-
tral Uppsala. The working atmosphere is international
with a regular recruitment of PhD students and post-
docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes an exciting
arena for multidisciplinary research in evolutionary bi-
ology in a broad sense, housing some 300 scientists and
graduate students, and with research programs in, for
example, ecology, genetics, genomics and developmen-
tal biology. The scientic environment with numerous
seminars, journal clubs and social activities oer ex-
cellent possibilities for contacts and collaborations. A
graduate school in 'The Genomics of Phenotypic Diver-
sity in Natural Populations' (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
education/postgrad/gradschool/) provides a frame-
work for courses and other activities for PhD students.
Local platforms for next-generation sequencing (http:/-
/www.scilifelab.uu.se) and high-performance computa-
tional analyses (http://www .uppmax.uu.se) ensure
immediate access to state-of-the-art technology. Up-
psala University is the oldest university in Scandinavia
and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with
beautiful and easy accessible surroundings conveniently
situated close to Stockholm.
The positions, which are funded by a European Re-
search Council Advanced Investigator Grant, are ali-
ated with the Department of Evolutionary Biology - an
overview of the research activities in the environment
can be found at our web pages (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
Research/IEG/evbiol/?languageId=3D1). Thanks to a
number of competitive grants recently obtained (includ-
ing four ERC grants), the environment has expanded
signicantly and houses 10 independent research groups
and about 25 PhD students, 20 postdocs, and some
bioinformaticians. A common theme is that we address
key questions in evolutionary biology, like speciation,
local adaptation, life history evolution, genome and
molecular evolution, using genomic approaches. Study
organisms include natural bird and plant populations,
Neurospora, Drosophila, zebra sh, domestic animals144 EvolDir December 1, 2013
and humans. We have tight connections with several
other research programs at the Evolutionary Biology
Centre.
Suitable background to these positions is a PhD either
geared toward molecular evolution, molecular ecology,
population genetics or bioinformatics. Experience from
bioinformatic analyses of next-generation sequencing
data is of general merit. Depending on which parts
of the project successful candidates will join, experi-
ence from e.g. speciation genetics, evolution of gene
expression or GWAS/QTL mapping will be of merit.
Informal inquiries and applications should be sent by
email to Hans.Ellegren@ebc.uu.se. Applicants must
provide a CV, a statement of research interests and
the name and contact details of at least two references.
The positions remain open until lled. Starting date is
exible.

Second edition; May 26-28, 2014. Instructor:Dr. Kieran McNulty ((University of Minnesota,
USA). Website: http://www.transmittingscience.org/-
courses/gm/ontogeny-and-gm/ This course will give
emphasis on using Geometric Morphometrics to address
questions related to growth, development, and evolu-

development. From here, we will take up the idea of
changes in ontogeny as a mechanism for producing evo-

status of environment ontologies: How many, how to
improve; Do we need a single environmental ontology?
2) Who is using these ontologies now? What are the use
cases? 3) How to include environment in annotations of
phenotypes? and 4) How to represent population-level
phenotypes with ontologies?
We estimate that the costs for this meeting (transporta-

March 8-15, 2014
Sponsored by the
University of California, Davis and Bodega Marine Lab-
oratory
http://treethinkers.org Introduction
Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized modern sys-
tematics and become indispensable tools in evolution,
ecology and comparative biology, playing an increas-
ingly important role in analyses of biological data at
levels of organization ranging from molecules to eco-
logical communities. The estimation of phylogenetic
trees is now a formalized statistical problem with gen-
eral agreement on the central issues and questions. A
nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
This Spring, for the fteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-

http://treethinkers.org Introduction
Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized modern sys-
tematics and become indispensable tools in evolution,
ecology and comparative biology, playing an increas-
ingly important role in analyses of biological data at
levels of organization ranging from molecules to eco-
logical communities. The estimation of phylogenetic
trees is now a formalized statistical problem with gen-
eral agreement on the central issues and questions. A
nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
This Spring, for the fteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-

Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Evolutionary Biology
(MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master pro-
gramme for talented and motivated European and non-
European students who are interested in understanding
evolution in all its facets. The MEME programme will
address the driving forces of evolution at all levels of
organismal organization (from cells and individuals to
populations and ecosystems), and it will allow students
to study all kinds of organisms (microorganisms, plants,
animals) in all kindsof habitats (marine as well as ter-
restrial) with a diversity of approaches (eld, lab, the-
ory). The focus of the programme is not only on how
evolution shaped life on our planet in the past, but also
on how understanding the principles underlying evolu-
tion can provide new insights and help to cope with
present-day challenges in a variety of elds, including
ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunology, genet-
ics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and the social
sciences.
Only few universities in the world would be able to oer
a programme of suchbroad scope without compromis-
ing scientic quality. For this reason, four European
universities: - University of Groningen (Netherlands) -
University of Montpellier II (France) - Ludwig Maximil-
ians University of Munich (Germany) - Uppsala Univer-
sity (Sweden) have joined forces with Harvard Univer-
sity (USA). Together, this consortium is able to put to-
gether an attractive multidisciplinary programme that
meets highest standards. All students have to study at
at least two partner universities and they will receive a
double degrees from two partner universities.
Being nanced by theEuropean Community,MEME has
to satisfy the high quality standardsimposed the pres-
tigiousErasmus Mundus Programme. Full scholarshipsare availablefor: - EU Students (for 2 years) - Non-EU
Students (for 2 years) - Scholars/ visiting scientists (for
2 weeks up to 3 months max)

description* The sequence of a genome alone does
not carry enough information to fully understand how
genomic processes are carried out in the cell nucleus;152 EvolDir December 1, 2013
to achieve this, the knowledge of the three-dimensional
(3D) architecture of a genome is necessary. Advances
in genomic technologies and the development of new
analytical methods, such as 3C-based methods, have
allowed getting insights at unprecedented resolution
into how the genome is organized. Recently, it has
been shown that chromatin is organized in Topologi-
cally Associating Domains (TADs), large interaction
domains that appear to be conserved among dierent
cell types. In this course, participants will learn
to use TADBit, a software for the analysis and 3D
modeling of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs)
and genomes. TADBit is based on a computational
module of the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP,
http://www.integrativemodeling.org) that uses chro-
mosome conformation capture data to determine
the 3D architecture of genomic domains and entire
genomes at unprecedented resolutions. Participants
can bring-in specic biological questions and/or their
on data to work on during the course.
*Target Audience* The course is oriented to experi-
mental researchers with minimal computational skills,
at the graduate and post-graduate levels. It is also
suitable for bioinformatics developers at all levels. We
anticipate that this course is attended by people with
several types of interests in genome organization. It
is likely that they may also aim at getting involved in
generating Hi-C data for chromosome structure deter-
mination and that they want to model its 3D represen-
tation, but that does not need to be the case for all
the participants: they may, for example, just want to
explore publicly available data.

Metabarcoding Mar31-Apr5154 EvolDir December 1, 2013
Dear Colleagues,
DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method for
assessing biodiversity from environmental DNA. It has
a wide range of applications: biodiversity monitoring,
animal diet assessment, reconstruction of paleo com-
munities, among others. DNA metabarcoding relies on
molecular techniques such as PCR and next generation
sequencing, and requires bioinformatics and biostatis-
tics competence to analyze sequencing results. This ap-
proach integrates several scientic areas and requires a
broad range of skills, in addition to the classical ecolog-
ical knowledge related to the considered research topic.
The DNA metabarcoding spring school is now in its
third edition and this year it is co-organized by the
metabarcoding.org team and the Research School in
Biosystematics - ForBio in Troms, Norway. Also this
year, the school is divided into two parts.
- The DNA metabarcoding spring school (31 March -
3 April 2014), that will be held during four days at
the Skibotn Field Station, - A two-day workshop at the
Troms University Museum that will follow the course
(4 - 5 April 2014).
The DNA metabarcoding spring school is open to 25participants. The two-day workshop is open without
limit to all person wishing to present their results in
DNA metabarcoding as a short talk of 15 min or as a
poster.
All participants attending both the school and work-
shop can receive a ForBio course certicate stating the

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of theDecember 1, 2013 EvolDir 155
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
