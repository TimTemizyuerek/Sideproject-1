Halo-DaSH: The Deep and Shallow History of Aquatic
Life's Passages between Marine and Freshwater Habi-
tats. A symposium to be held at the Annual Meeting
of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology
(SICB) in Phoenix Arizona (Jan 3-7, 2021)
Marine and freshwater biota have long been intertwined.
Major branches of the tree of life originated in the
oceans and colonized freshwater habitats; these deep-
time halo-transitions have transformed the biosphere
and a broad range of taxa. Yet these transitions exist as
shallow-time processes and halo-transitions occur today
in both directions, oering the opportunity to investigate
eco-evolutionary responses to changes in halo-habitatin real time. Indeed, in the shallowest time scale for
halo-transitions, individual organisms may live in both
freshwater and marine environments, such as in diadro-
mous shes. Moving between fresh and marine waters
requires navigating through estuarine zones of mixing
that have their own uniquely demanding regimes. The
organismal processes that permit halo-transitions pro-
vide an important context for exploring the deep-time
patterns of evolutionary euryhalinity.
We have organized a symposium and workshop on
the subject, with an accompanying contributed pa-
per session, at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the So-
ciety of Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB;
3-6 January, Phoenix Arizona). Information on the
symposium and workshop are at our website, https:/-
/draft.halodash.research.uconn.edu/. Contributed pa-
pers on this subject will have their own dedicated session.
Please consider submitting an abstract! Abstracts are
due on 9/1, at https://sicb.burkclients.com/meetings/-
2022/abstracts/index.php . Please direct any questions
about this to eric.schultz@uconn.edu.

AustralianNatlU BatEcholocation
ANU.BatEcholocation
We are oering a fully-funded 3 year PhD position at
the Australian National University. The project willemploy 3D modelling approaches to understand how
bats modify sound during echolocation.
**Project background** Bats possess some of the most
extreme mammalian adaptations. Having evolved both
echolocation and self-powered ight, bats underwent
one of the greatest adaptive radiations in mammalian
history, which enabled them to exploit an enormous
untapped foraging niche: insects in the night sky. Bat
echolocation is considered one of the most complex and
diverse modes of sensory perception in animals, but its
origin and evolutionary history is a highly contentious
issue that remains unresolved. This is due to diculty
in inferring the echolocation capabilities of fossil species,
along with a lack of molecular markers for echolocation
in bats and their potential relatives. The broad aim
of this project is to combine insights from craniofacial
development, evolution and form-function engineering
tests to uncover echolocation traits and assess how dif-
ferences in cranial shape relate to sound production.
**The PhD position** The PhD student will use 3D scan
data, represented by diceCT (soft-tissue stained) and
microCT, to construct and validate engineering models
that simulate airway function in bats. These models
will be used to understand the functional implications
of cranial shape variation among echolocators.
**The project team** The PhD student will work with a
mutli-disciplinary team of researchers, led by Dr Laura
Wilson at ANU, in collaboration with Dr Jason Bourke
(New York Institute of Technology), Assoc. Prof. Al-
istair Evans (Monash University) and Assoc. Prof.
Daisuke Koyabu (University of Tsukuba, Japan).
**The student** The successful applicant must have an
excellent grade (i.e. H1 or HD/First Class International
equivalent) in an Honours or MSc research program in6 EvolDir September 1, 2021
a relevant subject area and proven skills in scientic
writing. The student should have a strong quantita-
tive background in evolutinary morphology/zoology or,
preferably, engineering and a willingness to learn compu-
tational modelling approaches. Experience with Finite
Element Modelling or Computational Fluid Dynamics
is desirable.
Interested applicants should send a cover letter outlining
their motivation and experience, an academic CV, and
a list of contact information for 1-3 academic referees
to Dr Laura Wilson (Laura.Wilson@anu.edu.au) by 3
Sept 2021. This scholarship is open to Australian cit-
izens, permanent residents and international students.
The Australian National University is a member of the
Group of Eight, Australia's leading research-intensive
universities, and is ranked 31st in the world (QS World

Cellular, and Photonic Mechanisms of Avian Structural
Colouration (reference 101000504)".
We seek a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to be
a key player in a multi-team collaboration to elucidate
the genetic, cellular, molecular, and photonic basis of
avian structural coloration using the tail feathers of
the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) as a model system.
The ideal candidate will have prior experience in using
the techniques of cell and molecular biology to studydevelopment and/or physiology in vertebrates. The can-
didate will be primarily focused on understanding how
the genes identied by genetic mapping are expressed

teins function to create the remarkable nanostructures
that underlie the peafowl's brilliant structural colors.
The techniques to be used by the candidate will include
(but are not limited to) in situ hybridization, antibody
staining, light and electron microscopy, cell and tis-
sue culture, virus-mediated transgenesis, CRISPR-Cas9-
mediated knock-out, reporter assays, and HPLC.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Wheat is one of the most
important crops globally, forming a crucial part of hu-
man diet. Bread wheat has a polyploid genome result-
ing from ancient hybridization between its diploid and
tetraploid progenitors some 10K years ago. Understand-
ing the genetic consequences of polyploidization on the
wheat genome, transcriptome, and ultimately pheno-
type, can have crucial implications for utilization of
genetic diversity in breeding. The seminal polyploidiza-
tion of bread wheat evolution can be recreated in ex-
perimental settings, producing synthetic/nascent poly-
ploids, which are not simply a sum total of the parental
genomes, but are modied by various genetic and epige-
netic changes, including sequence elimination, transcrip-
tomic changes and epigenetic modications. Although
some of these changes are reproducible and similar to the
ones found in natural polyploid wheats, their systematic,
genome-wide characterisation is lacking. Moreover, the
mechanistic basis of these changes remains poorly under-
stood, and it is unclear whether they are necessary for
proper functioning and fertility of the nascent polyploids,
or mere (potentially deleterious) byproducts of the poly-
ploidization process. The best described consequence
of polyploidization in wheat is the re-programming of
its transcriptome, also called expression partitioning.
Transcriptomic studies have shown that homoeolog si-
lencing is pervasive in bread wheat, with 27.6%-45%
of homoeologous groups having one or two gene copies
silenced. A portion of these changes is established im-
mediately after polyploidization and can be studied
in synthetic allohexploids. Although there are several
possibilities how transcriptional reprogramming can be
achieved (e.g., gene loss, TE insertion in gene's vicinity;
position eect due to translocation), mounting evidence
suggests that DNA methylation (i.e. cytosine methyla-
tion) is the primary mechanism of polyploidy-induced
reprogramming that ensures its heritability. Despite the
obvious importance of gene expression (de)regulation
in polyploid crops, virtually no studies have examined
on the genome-wide scale the possible links between
gene expression changes and DNA methylation patterns
in nascent wheat polyploids. This projects aims to
provide gene-based (but genome-wide) exploration of
these processes. Building on existing transcriptomic
data collected from families of nascent synthetic allo-
hexaploids where 'binary DEGs' have been identied
(dierentially expressed genes showing no transcription
in the synthetic wheat despite robust transcription inthe parents), the PhD candidate will rst explore gene
losses and aneuploidy as the potential causes of such
patterns. Subsequently, the core of the project will fo-
cus on links between cytosine methylation and altered
expression. These will be explored through methylome
sequencing (Illumina) of amplicon libraries (homoeolog-
specic) constructed from the binary DEGs. Various
gene partitions (UTRs, exons, introns), sequence con-
texts (CpG, CHG, CHH), crossing schemes, tissues and
generation will be examined to provide a detailed as-
sessment of methylation changes in respect to altered
transcription in polyploids. These changes will be evalu-
ated in the context of wheat diversity and agronomically
important traits, with the aim to inform future breeding
eorts.
REQUIRED SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS: * MSc
degree in molecular genetics, or similar (required) *
wet-lab experience with DNA extractions, PCR, etc.
(required) * experience with primer design and DNA
methylation analysis (benecial) * bioinformatics: expe-

JagiellonianU EvolutionEndothermy
Graduate position
PhD in Avian Oxidative Stress Biology A fully funded
PhD 4-year position is available in the research team of
Ulf Bauchinger at the Institute of Environmental Sci-
ences, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland (https:/-
/eko.uj.edu.pl/zespoly-badawcze/badania).
Project in brief:
As endotherms, mammals and birds have evolved the
capacity to thermoregulate, an evolutionary achieve-
ment with profound impact on biology and ecology.
Endothermy, however, does not necessarily entail a con-
stant body temperature throughout a day, a year or
a life time. Instead, many mammals are known to hi-
bernate seasonally or enter torpor, reducing their body
temperature by a few ^AoC to several tens of ^AoC be-
low the normothermic level. Birds are known to also
become torpid or and reduce body temperature during
the night by rather a few ^AoC with some exceptions
of up to two tens of ^AoC. These on rst sight small
temperature drops may, however, have profound eects
on enzymatic activity. The rate of biochemical reactions
in general, and enzymatic reactions in particular are
highly temperature dependent, which also applies to
enzymes that act as antioxidants against free radicals.
They protect against the negative eects of oxidative
stress through free radical scavenging and if this protec-
tive enzymatic action is reduced in its rate, free radicals
may remain unchecked, which may lead to oxidative
damage of biomolecules. Such oxidative damage risks
functional integrity of biomolecules and is currently one
of the most frequently forwarded driver of aging. This
research is designed to understand how regulation of
body temperature may be hampered by increasing age
and how this impaired thermoregulatory capability may
lead to increased oxidative stress when animals grow
old.
While it is well established for mammals, including us
humans, that body temperature and the capacity to
thermoregulate declines with increasing age, such data
are virtually absent for birds, and in addition were never
linked to oxidative stress. Our research project will pro-
vide thorough understanding how age in the context of10 EvolDir September 1, 2021
senescence inuences thermoregulation in birds. The
second goal of our research is then to relate the ther-
mogenic capacity of birds of dierent age to oxidative
stress to test the hypothesis that body temperature is
related to the rate of oxidative damage. The starting
date is ideally October 2021. Review of applications will
begin on September 3, 2021 until the position is lled.

a MSc in life science (biology, ecology, evolution, zo-
ology or related), an interest in animal experimental
biology, avian physiology and animal metabolism for

Description of project One of the main challenges in
biology is to understand the evolution of complex adap-
tations that allow realization of the astonishing variety
of \lifestyles." Predator-prey interactions are important
components in ecological communities, where under the
pressure of natural selection, predators have evolved
a variety of behavioral, morphological and/or physio-
logical adaptations for detecting, catching, killing, and
digesting prey. The examples include the wolf with its
cooperate hunting skills, the cheetah - the world's fastest
land animal, the golden eagle with excellent eyesight that
allows to spot even a small prey from the great height, or
the grasshopper mouse Onychomys, hunting on cotton
rats that are three times their weight. The predatory
behavior is important not only from the ecological and
evolutionary, but also from biomedical perspective. It
is surprising that our knowledge concerning biological
mechanism determining the predatory aggression is very
limited, especially in comparison with that concerning
conspecic-directed aggressive behavior.
The main question to be addressed in the project: Char-
acterization of details of the predatory behavior to learn
whether the selection increased only the propensity to
attack, or also the hunting skills. Is selection for preda-
tory behavior caused changes in conspecic-directed
aggression? Assessing the contribution of \nature - nur-
ture" eects on the behavioral dierences between the
predatory and control lines. Uncovering the mechanisms
underlying the dierences due to selection for predatory
behavior, we will investigate hormones, neurotransmit-
ters and brain activity activated by recent experience
with crickets. We will use our unique experimental evo-
lution model system: lines of a rodent, the bank vole,
selected for predatory behavior. The biochemical and
neurological methods will be used to uncover the mech-
anisms underlying the dierences due to selection for
predatory behaviour. We will apply a cross-fostering
experiment in which newborn voles will be exchanged
between mothers from the selected and control lines.
This will allow to test whether rearing by a predatory
mother increases predatory propensity of an individual
independently of its genetic background. Samples of
tissues will be preserved for follow-up project focused
on for investigation of the molecular background (gene
expression level). For further information please contactSeptember 1, 2021 EvolDir 11

Liverpool HippopotamusEvolution
PhD project title: Molecular phylogeny of extinct and
extant hippopotamus species
Project outline: The family Hippopotamidae is an in-
triguing mammal group; extant hippo are more closely
related to whales and dolphins (clade Whippomorpha)
than to the many ruminants that occupy similar niches
- and habitat in Africa. Over the Pliocene-Pleistocene
and into the Holocene - there were over 30 species within
the family. Many became extinct during the Pleistocene
- but some persisted through the Holocene until very
recently. At present there are two extant hippos; the
common hippo and the pygmy hippo. We propose the
application of ancient DNA techniques to determine his-
torical relationships within the Family Hippopotamidae
A PhD position is available for this research.
Location: Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) in
the United Kingdom will administer this collaborative
project, in collaboration with Aberdeen University. The
Project will principally be based in the Ancient DNA
Lab at LJMU (Prof Richard Brown and Dr Lochran
Traill) and Aberdeen (Dr Linus Girdland Flink). There
will be an expectation to travel to Africa including
Madagascar and also the Mediterranean region. Dr
Traill has aliation with Witwatersrand University in
South Africa to facilitate work in Southern Africa.
Duration: 3 years
Eligibility: British Nationals only, or EU Nationals that
have permanent residence in the UK.Financial support: this is for British nationals. Scholar-
ships are available for high achieving students through
the LJMU Vice Chancellor Award Scheme with a dead-

Montpellier 2 PlasticityPhenology
We are looking for a PhD student (3 years funding) in co
direction between Celine Teplitsky (Montpellier, France)
and Pierre-Yves Henry (Brunoy, France). Plasticity of
phenology is considered as one of the major mechanisms
through which organisms can adapt to climate change.
However, we still know little about the limits to the
expression of plasticity in new environments such as
exceptionally warm springs or urban environments.
This PhD project will tackle this question by investigat-
ing whether we can already see limits to plasticity in
exceptionally warm years, and/or in urban environments
(where the nutrient and heat constraints are magnied).
The project will be run at a large spatial scale, based
on human landscape use. If such limits of plasticity
exist (1) can they be predicted based on some species /
populations / habitats features, and (2) what are the
constraints to the evolution of plasticity? This last
question will be tackled by investigating the within pop-
ulation genetic variance for plasticity and the extent
to which it varies among populations, but also across
species, trying to evaluate more long term constraints
on plasticity evolution.
This project will be based on statistical analyses of long
term data obtained from monitoring of wild bird popu-
lations, mainly blue and great tits but an interspecic
approach can be developed on several passerines birds
based on citizen science monitoring
Work conditions: The PhD will be implemented at the
CEFE (Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive,
Montpellier, France) and at MECADEV (M ecanismes12 EvolDir September 1, 2021
adaptatifs & Evolution, MNHN, Brunoy, France).
Appointment. The appointment is for a period of 3
years (period: November 2021 - October 2024) from a
funding from the  >1
2Climate and Biodiversity initiative'
of BNP Paribas. The salary is 1700 eafter taxes and
includes social security benets. The candidate commits
to complete a PhD dissertation, at least two publica-
tions in high-prole international journals before PhD
defence, and communication(s) at international congress
Requirements: Candidates are expected to have a MSc
degree (Master 2 in France) in evolutionary biology or
ecology with a strong statistical background. The PhD
student will be expected to contribute to data collection
during the eld season. Field experience is a plus but
not mandatory if there is a will to learn.
Applications. Written applications (in French
or English), including a cover letter, a com-
plete CV, marks obtained obtained at university

We are looking for a PhD student (3 years funding) in

ticity of phenology is considered as one of the major
mechanisms through which organisms can adapt to cli-
mate change. However, we still know little about the
ecological factors that will constrain or facilitate this
adaptation.
This PhD project is organized around two main themes
(1) Evaluate how environmental conditions aect the
expression of plasticity. Plasticity is always a response
to the environment, but this plasticity (i.e. how the
organism responds to the environment) can itself change
with the environment, due to simultaneous variation
in multiple factors or environments experienced earlier
in the organisms' life; and (2) Evaluate how adaptive
these responses are to multiple environmental factors.
Recent modelling approaches allow estimating optimum
phenotypes in the wild and assessing the adaptive value
of expressed reaction norms.This project will be based on statistical analyses of long

SexDeterminationEvolution
PhD position: Sex chromosome evolution in a viviparous
reptile with genotypic and temperature-dependent sex
determination
Project theme:
Sex-determination controls the most signicant varia-
tion within animals- the division into males and females.
While the dierent systems of sex-determination involv-
ing genetic or environmental control are relatively well
understood, transitions between these systems remain
enigmatic in evolutionary biology. This project aims to
address this gap by revealing the molecular and cytoge-
netic changes required to transition between modes, us-
ing one of only two known lizard species exhibiting both
genetic and temperature control of sex. This knowledge
will have important implications for species conservation,
facilitating predictions of highly biased sex ratios under
climate change, plus potential commercial applications
for species where the production of one sex is favoured.
A PhD position is available to contribute to this research.
This student will conduct advanced cytogenetic researchSeptember 1, 2021 EvolDir 15

genomic changes accompanying transitions between ge-
netic and temperature-dependent sex determination.

The Evolutionary (Meta-)genomics group in the Bioin-
formatics Group at Wageningen University invites ap-
plications for a bioinformatics PhD student in  >1
2Virus
diversity and evolution in natural plant ecosystems'.
You might share our view that wild plant communities
might act as viral reservoirs that are also connected to
agricultural plants. Since viruses can spill over from
natural to agricultural systems, it is highly relevant to
characterize virus diversity in wild plants. Plant virus
genomes are highly diverse and evolve rapidly. To know
which role plant viruses play in shaping natural plant
communities, we must characterize their biodiversity
and evolution.
You might be familiar with the phenomenon that plant
virus infections are often asymptomatic, i.e., they do not
cause overt disease, and can even be benecial for the
host. Recently, plant virus research expanded from the
study of individual virus-host systems into characteriz-
ing global diversity using metagenomics, i.e., sequencing
the genetic content of environmental samples without
the need for prior virus isolation. Metagenomics led
to the surprising observation that virus infections areubiquitous, that there is a high incidence of mixed infec-
tion, and that most plant viruses identied in crops also
occur in wild plants. There is growing evidence that
viruses can impact plant ecosystems, which calls for a
reappraisal of the role of viruses in natural ecosystems
and accentuates the need to understand virus genomes
and their function and evolution.
The aim of this project is to develop bioinformatics meth-
ods to analyze plant virus metagenome data that has
been sampled from wild plants in the Netherlands. This
(and potentially your) project will contribute to under-
standing plant virus diversity and evolution in natural
Dutch ecosystems. You will contribute to developing
bioinformatics methods to discover and reconstruct virus
genomes from high-throughput plant virus sequencing
data and to analyze ecological and evolutionary proper-
ties of these viruses. To this end, we aim to analyze the
eect of host range and mixed infections on intra-host
diversity and estimate how recombination and selection
impact virus genome evolution.
Beyond the scientic and potentially application merits,
you will build a wide network for your future career
both within and outside Wageningen University.
The research is embedded within the chair group of
Bioinformatics at Wageningen University which is led by
Prof. Dick de Ridder (https://www.bioinformatics.nl/).
You will be supervised by Dr. Anne Kupczok (https://-
annecmg.github.io/). The research will be carried out in
close collaboration with Dr. Mark Zwart at the Nether-
lands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) (https://-
nioo.knaw.nl/nl/employees/mark-zwart). The position
is for four years and funded by the graduate school Ex-
perimental Plant Sciences (https://www.graduateschool-
eps.info/).
We ask - a successfully completed MSc degree in bioin-
formatics or a related eld; - excellent background in
high-throughput sequencing analysis and comparative
genomics; - anity with ecology, evolution, and popu-
lation genomics; - interest in close collaborations with
experimental biologists and ability to work eectively
as a team member and to carry out individual research;
- very good level of oral and written English.

SangerInstitute UK TreeofLife
The Tree of Life Programme at the Sanger Institute
is seeking to recruit four Faculty leaders at any level
with research interests in any (or a combination) of
the following: - biodiversity genomics requiring largescale data generation - comparative genomics of symbio-
sis. - computational phylogenomics including phylogeny
reconstruction across the tree of life.
Faculty positions in Tree of Life
The Tree of Life Programme is a new initiative, taking
its place in the global vanguard of genomic science. Our
focus is to understand the structure and function of
the biomes that support human society, at a time when
those systems face acute strain. Using the latest long-
read and long-range sequencing technologies, as well as
algorithmic advances in assembly and curation, it is now
feasible to sequence all life. The Darwin Tree of Life
project and Earth Biogenome Project aim to do just
that, their ambition only matched by the dedication of
their teams. The data gathered across these and other
projects will be used to investigate species diversity,
species interactions and the evolution of genome struc-
ture - and all of it will be made openly available to the
wider scientic community. Having launched in 2019,
the Tree of Life programme is now fully operational and
has become one of the most exciting places to work in
biodiversity genomics. We will also gain new insights
into molecular mechanisms that underpin genetic asso-
ciations with diseases and traits involving blood and
immune cells, including both disease susceptibility and
disease progression, to empower the development of new
drugs and the implementation of eective stratied and
preventative medicine.
Humanity stands at a crossroads, where climate change
and environmental degradation threaten to cause the
sixth great extinction. Understanding the interconnect-
edness of the health of human society and ecosystem
health, we will deliver a groundbreaking programme to
sequence the diversity of eukaryotic life on Earth. Using
decades of experience at the Wellcome Sanger Institute
and radical new technologies, we will produce high qual-
ity reference genomes and explore their evolution, their
functioning, and their interactions with each other. We
will analyse these data to understand life's origins, con-
serve biodiversity and provide the underpinnings of a
new biotechnology.
For more information about the programme visit
www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/tree-of-life/ Support in
Tree of Life
We have an established core operations infrastructure
to support delivery of the far-reaching ambitions of the
Programme. The Delivery & Operations teams, led by
the Associate Director of Delivery & Operations, are
structured into four primary areas:
* Production Genomics: responsible for high-throughput
data generation, including assembly and curation for32 EvolDir September 1, 2021
tens of thousands of reference genomes
* Enabling Platforms: responsible for building new soft-
ware systems and data management
* Informatics Infrastructure: responsible for implement-
ing cutting- edge informatics pipelines and managing
programme IT infrastructure
* Project Management & Operations: responsible for
meeting the many compliance, admin and project man-
agement needs of our scientists
These teams work collaboratively to deliver a backbone
of operational support to the Tree of Life Programme
Faculty, as well as major national and international se-
quencing consortia, enabling them to focus on delivering
their cutting-edge research.
The operations teams also provide a key interface with
central Institute functions including the core Sanger
pipelines within Scientic Operations and the Manage-
ment Operations teams. The Project Management &
Operations team provides day-to-day administration
including core and grant funding nance management,
identifying third party funding opportunities, and en-
suring regulatory and legal compliance in collaboration
with central Institute teams.
Roles available in Tree of Life
The Wellcome Sanger Institute is seeking up to four ex-
ceptional scientists across all levels of its Faculty model,
each joining as a Core Faculty member leading a re-
search team in Tree of Life and contributing to the
Institute's scientic portfolio. Positions carry a signif-
icant core package of salaries and support, which are
backed by rewarding and exible employment terms
including excellent benets and relocation support.
Our exceptional core funding enables the Faculty to
focus their energy on science, supported by a rapidly
growing team of dedicated scientists and science facil-
itators, and beneting from the state-of-the-art facili-
ties located in the beautiful grounds of the Wellcome
Genome Campus.

Barcelona PredictingEvolution
Predicting evolution (postdoc in Barcelona): Comparing
the approaches of evo-devo and quantitative genetics in
predicting articial selection experiments.
1.Job/ project description:
The research will involve using, rening and adapting
an existing mathematical model of wing morphogenesis
to explore whether it can be used to predict how wing
morphology changes over generations in an articial
selection experiment. In addition, we will estimate the
matrix of additive genetic covariances between morpho-
logical traits in the wings of the experiment (12 traits
per wing to fully conform a multivariate analysis). In
contrast to most existing experiments we will estimate
this G matrix in each generation to better predict mor-
phological evolution in the experiment. This matrix
will also be used to predict the result of the articial
selection experiments. We will then compare, quanti-
tatively, the predictive accuracy of the developmental
model approach compared to the quantitative genetics
approach. We will not just check which approach better
predicts evolution, we will also study which aspects of
morphological evolution (e.g. linear/non-linear, dimen-
sionality, etc.) are better predicted by one approach or
the other and why.
The research will take place in the Genetics and Micro-
biology Department of the Autonomous University of
Barcelona but in close collaboration with the Biotech-
nology Institute in the University of Helsinki.
The job is for 1,5 years and it may be extendable for
two more years.
2. Background:
The process of embryonic development is now widely ac-
knowledged to be crucial to understand evolution since
any change in the phenotype in evolution (e.g. morphol-
ogy) is rst a change in the developmental process by
which this phenotype is produced. Over the years we
have come to learn that there is a set of developmental
rules that determine which phenotypic variation can
possibly arise in populations due to genetic mutation
(the so called genotype-phenotype map). Since natural
selection can act only on existing phenotypic variation,
these rules of development have an eect on the direction
of evolutionary change.
Our group is devoted to understand these developmental
rules and how these can help to better understand thedirection of evolutionary change. The ultimate goal is
to modify evolutionary theory by considering not only
natural selection in populations but also developmen-
tal biology in populations. For that aim we combine
mathematical models of embryonic development that
relate genetic variation to morphological variation with
population models. The former models are based on
what is currently known in developmental biology.
There are two traditional approaches to study pheno-
typic evolution. One is quantitative genetics and one
is developmental evolutionary biology. The former is
based in the statistics of the association between ge-
netic relatedness and phenotypic variation between in-
dividuals in populations, the latter in the genetic and
bio-mechanical manipulation of the development of lab
individuals. While the former models trait variation
with an statistical linear approach the latter models it by
deterministic non-linear models of gene networks and tis-
sue bio-mechanics. For the most, these two approaches
are largely isolated from each other.
The current project aims to contrast and put together
these two approaches in a specic easy to study system:
the y wing. In brief, we are growing y populations
and, in each generation, we select the founders of the
next generation based on how close they resemble an
arbitrary optimal morphology in their wings (based on
the proportions between several of their traits). In each
generation also, we estimate the G matrix and the selec-
tion gradient to see how well one can predict evolution
in the next generation. The quantitative genetics predic-
tions will be contrasted with the predictions stemming
from a wing morphogenesis model that we built based
on our current understanding of wing developmental
biology (see Dev Cell. 2015 Aug 10;34(3):310-22 for
the model and for slightly similar approaches: Nature.
2013 May 16;497(7449):361-4. and Nature. 2010 Mar
25;464(7288):583-6 and
Evolution. 2020 Feb;74(2):230-244)
Our groups in Barcelona and Helsinki include researchers
working in the developmental biology of teeth, wing,
brain and coating patterns and bioinformaticians, popu-
lational and quantitative geneticists, systems biologists
and paleontologists.
3. Requirements:
The applicant must hold a PhD in either evolutionary
biology, developmental biology, quantitative genetics,
statistics, morphometrics or in evolutionary develop-
mental biology (evo-devo). Applicants with a PhD in
theoretical or mathematical biology are also welcome.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.46 EvolDir September 1, 2021

and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for

vantage of a novel spatial modelling framework and
paleoclimate reconstructions to disentangle complex de-
mographies and heterogeneous selection pressures in
space and time. The PDRA will work on model devel-
opment, but, depending on interest and time, there will
be the opportunity to be involved in the application of
the models to some of the case studies.
You should hold a PhD in bioinformatics, genetics or a
relevant subject, and demonstrable skills in coding in
C++. Previous experience building population genetics
models, ideally with selection, is essential. You will
enjoy working with a wide range of people, as part of a
team, and be able to organise your time eectively.

ComparativePopulationGenomics
We are hiring two postdoctoral fellows to work on an
NIH-funded project focused on the comparative and52 EvolDir September 1, 2021
population genomics of conserved non-coding elements
in birds, building on our published work on PhyloAcc,
a program to infer evolutionary forces acting on non-
coding sequences in a phylogenetic context.
There are two positions. The rst position will be ideal
for a candidate with a background in Bayesian statistics,
and will focus on developing new comparative genomic
models and methods to detect genome-wide signatures
of adaptive evolution on phylogenies and link genomic
and phenotypic variation on trees. The second position
will be ideal for a candidate with a background in popu-
lation genetics or comparative genomics, and will focus
on the within-species population genetics of conserved
non-coding elements, including linking sequence varia-
tion to function in collaboration with colleagues with
expertise in developmental biology. Both positions will
be based at Harvard University in the groups of Scott
Edwards (Organismic and Evolutionary Biology), Jun
Liu (Statistics), and Tim Sackton (Bioinformatics).
Funding is available for multiple (up to 3) years; contin-
uation and extension will be based on ongoing successful
performance. We expect the successful candidates to
be on site so as to maximize interaction with PIs and
others working on the project.
*Qualications* The preferred candidates will have
broad expertise in statistics, computational biology, pop-
ulation genetics, phylogenetics, computer science, or
related elds, and a demonstrated record of research
achievement (via publications or preprints). Candi-
dates for the rst position will benet from expertise
in developing new phylogenetic statistical models and
comparative methods, whereas candidates for the sec-
ond position will benet from expertise in evolutionary
biology, population genetics, or comparative genomics.
Experience with bioinformatics, working with large-scale
data, and computational method development (using
Python, C, C++, or a related language) will benet any
candidate.
However, enthusiasm for the research questions, a track
record of accomplishment, and a desire to learn are more
important than any specic skills.
*Working Environment* The successful candidates will
be based in one or more of the PI labs (Jun Liu, Scott
Edwards, Tim Sackton). The exact logistics are ex-
ible and will depend on the candidate's interests and
experience, and the postdoctoral associates will have
an opportunity to gain experience and training in bioin-
formatics, statistics, population genetics, comparative
genomics, developmental genetics,and ornithology as
necessary. The successful candidates will also have the
opportunity to interact with collaborators Emma Far-
ley (UCSD) and Cli Tabin (Harvard Medical School).The combined experience of our groups spans a wide
range of topics and provides an outstanding opportunity
for training, collaboration, and scientic growth. The
larger scientic environment in Boston is unparalleled
and provides numerous opportunities for engagement,
including the Boston Area Evolutionary Supergroup
and numerous seminar series and journal clubs.
*Contact* Preferred start date would be fall of 2021, but
there is exibility around this. To apply, please send
a CV and cover letter describing interest and previous
experience to Tim Sackton (tsackton at g.harvard.edu),
Scott Edwards (sedwards at fas.harvard.edu), or Jun
Liu (jliu at stat.harvard.edu) cc-ing all three. Informal
inquiries welcome. Applications will be reviewed on a

be part of an attempt to generate a synthetic, systems-
level understanding of how a tropical forest ecosystem
operates. We are building a team to create a virtual
rainforest: a general ecosystem model replicating the
physical and biotic components of the ecosystem and
their interactions, with a view to understanding system-
level emergent properties.
You will be responsible of developing a process-based
simulation of the physical environment in a tropical
rainforest ecosystem, that will be one of four modules
that together will form the virtual rainforest (the others
are plants, animals and soil microbes). Your simulation
will be based on inputs of local topography, macro and
regional climate from atmospheric circulation models,
and dynamically updated vegetation structure from the
plants module, from which it will need to predict spatial
and temporal variation in microclimate (e.g. air and
soil temperature, soil moisture, vapour pressure decit),September 1, 2021 EvolDir 53
vertical proles of wind speed and canopy temperature,
and, ideally, streamow (e.g. base ows, ood frequency
and magnitude).
Your primary role will be to develop the physical environ-
ment module of a virtual rainforest simulation, and you
will be assisted in this by additional team members. The
project provides a generous budget for placements and
secondments to collaborate with research groups beyond
our own. The virtual rainforest will rely heavily on data
collected from the SAFE Project (www.safeproject.net),
and you will be required to help with the management
of these datasets. All team members will be expected
to help develop the skills and competencies of their
peers through the sharing of tasks and knowledge, and
you will be given time, resources and encouragement to
pursue your professional development.
We specically encourage female applicants and appli-
cants from underrepresented groups in STEM subjects.
We also welcome applications from candidates that
would like full-time or part-time positions on this project,
and will explore job-sharing arrangements should that
be appropriate.
Applicants from any climate, physics or ecological back-
ground are encouraged to apply. You will be one member
of a core team of ve people, across which we are seeking
team members who provide complementary technical
skills and disciplinary knowledge. Programming experi-
ence - preferably in Python - is essential, and experience
with either process-based or numeric simulation mod-
elling is desirable.
This position is full-time and xed term until 30 Septem-
ber 2024, and will be based at Imperial College London's
Silwood Park Campus.

LundU ProteinEvolution
There is a post-doc position available in Gemma Atkin-
son's protein evolution group in Lund University.
Information and application instructions here:https:/-
/atkinson-lab.com/post-doctoral-scholarship-in-
bioinformatics/ In the Atkinson lab our aim is to
make fundamental discoveries about the evolution of
protein function and structure. We work mainly with
bioinformatic methods, developing our own tools and
taking advantage of the huge amounts of available
genome and predicted proteome sequences. One of our
main research directions concerns toxin-antitoxin (TA)
systems of bacteria and bacteriophages. Our studies of
toxSAS TA enzymes that dramatically inhibit bacterial
growth though producing poisonous nucleotides, or
modifying tRNA have recently been recently published
in PNAS [1] and Molecular Cell [2], respectively, and
our recent discovery of a hyperpromiscuous antitoxin
domain that we have named Panacea is currently
in revision [3]. As a mechanism of defence against
bacteriophages, TAs have signicance for developing
new biotechnological tools, as well as understanding
and eventually overcoming natural barriers to phage
therapy for treating antibiotic resistant infections.
Our work on toxin-antitoxins, and their evolution,
structure, function and biotechnological applications
was recently supported by a generous project grant
from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation
(https://kaw.wallenberg.org/grundforskning-djupt-
inne-i-bakteriernas-arvsmassa).
The post-doctoral scholarship will be an opportunity for
scientic development in protein bioinformatics and skill
acquisition in coding and web development. Building onSeptember 1, 2021 EvolDir 57
the success of our gene-neighbourhood analysis Python
tool FlaGs (www.webags.se) [4], you will be participat-
ing in the development of bioinformatic methods for the
discovery of new exciting biology. The bioinformatic
predictions will be tested experimentally in our group
and through our collaborative network.

Postdoctoral Position, Oklahoma State University Eco-
logical Immunogenetics and Amphibian Disease Ecology
Research in the Waldman lab at the Department of In-
tegrative Biology at Oklahoma State University focuses
on the interaction of disease, adaptive immune function,
and the evolution of behavioral strategies to eectively
respond to emerging infectious pathogens.
Recent studies demonstrate that amphibians can rapidly
evolve immunogenetic defenses to pathogens such as the
amphibian chytrid fungus. However, these adaptations
potentially entail life-history costs that otherwise de-
crease tness. We are examining, from an integrative
perspective, how immune system genes, through the
production of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules and their regulation of microbial assemblages,
generate social signals. Studies are underway both of
the mechanisms of social discrimination and their tness
consequences.
The project is global in scope, and takes advantage of
collaborations with researchers in Asia, Australia, Cen-
tral America and Europe. The successful candidate will
have ample opportunities to interact with members of
our department along with international colleagues. The
Department of Integrative Biology has 28 faculty whose
research addresses three main research themes: ecology,62 EvolDir September 1, 2021
evolution, and environmental stress, all key aspects of
our project.
Candidates should have a Ph.D. in biology or related
elds with experience in molecular biology, population
genetics, bioinformatics, and a strong interest in evolu-
tion. Initial appointment is for one year, with expecta-
tion of renewal given satisfactory progress. The position
is available beginning October 1, although the start date
can be negotiated.
Oklahoma State University is a Carnegie Tier 1 re-
search university with excellent facilities for research
and instruction, including a high-performance comput-
ing center. Because of its mid-continent location that
spans a broad expanse of habitats, from deciduous forest
to semi-arid grasslands, Oklahoma oers a rich tapestry

Post Doctoral Scholar
Establishing a national tissue and reagents repository
for chronic wasting disease
We seek a postdoctoral researcher to assist in estab-
lishing a national CWD tissue and reagents repository.
The signicance of this program is multifold. First, a
repository of CWD eld isolates from a wide-ranging
geographic location in North America will allow, for the
rst time, the means to begin to assess the distribu-
tion and frequency of CWD strains in North America.
Since prion strains can dier in pathogenicity and host
range, this is essential data for the determination for
risk of interspecies prion transmission to humans and
to domestic livestock and wildlife. Second, this reposi-
tory can provide uniform standardized CWD-infected
and uninfected sources of tissue for diagnostic develop-
ment, mitigation testing and for basic research purposes.
Finally, the implementation of the repository will facili-
tate cooperation between the various state agencies thatcould lead to new collaborative eorts.
The Post Doctoral Scholar will be responsible for three
specic objectives: 1. Summarize current state of knowl-
edge of known strain types in various cervid species
throughout the world for submission to a peer reviewed
journal, 2. Assist in creating online infrastructure for a
virtual tissue and reagents repository for chronic wast-
ing disease along with researchers at the Department of
Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and
3. Assisting ORNL with linking metadata for tissues
and reagents to the repository by working with state
agencies interested in contributing samples to the online
repository.
This project aligns with FY21 EMA annual guidance,
and was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
RFP priority: Chronic Wasting Disease. This is also
part of a larger collaborative eort with the USDA-
APHIS-WS, National Wildlife Research Center and
USGS.
The successful candidate will be part of an interdisci-
plinary group that includes ecologists, geneticists, vet-
erinarians, and state agency researchers. This full-time
position is located at The Pennsylvania State University,
University Park, Pennsylvania or remotely depending
on the candidate's preference. The selected candidate
must agree to follow all Covid-19 safety guidelines and
protocols established by the university. This is a one-
year appointment, with an additional 6 months possible
pending performance and funding availability. Start
date is exible and dependent upon hiring process but
ideally within a month or two of oer.
Salary: $60,000/year plus excellent benets.
Closing date: Until position lled
Qualications: Competitive candidates should be highly
motivated and possess a PhD in prion biology or disease
epidemiology or a related discipline. Specic experi-
ence with prion biology is preferred. The ability to
work both independently and collaboratively in a team
environment is essential. Submission to or publishing
in peer-reviewed journals is required and mandatory
prior to any potential renewal beyond the one-year ap-
pointment. Please provide: (1) a cover letter detail-

UCalifornia Berkeley
ConservationPopulationGenomics
Project Scientist in conservation and population ge-
nomics Nachman lab, UC Berkeley Details: https://-
aprecruit.berkeley.edu/JPF03075 There is an opening
for a Project Scientist to study conservation and popu-
lation genomics of mammals as part of the California
Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP) in the lab of
Professor Michael Nachman in the Museum of Verte-
brate Zoology at UC Berkeley. The California Con-
servation Genomics Project (CCGP) is a state-funded
initiative with the goal of producing the most compre-
hensive, multispecies, genomic dataset ever assembled
to help manage regional biodiversity. More information
about this statewide eort can be found here: https://-
www.ccgproject.org/. This position will involve bioin-
formatic analysis of whole-genome sequences from 750
individual mammal specimens representing 15 species.
The primary goal of this project is to generate a map
of genetic diversity for these 15 species across Cali-
fornia. We are also interested in inferring historical
demographic changes, assessing the extent to which se-
lection has shaped patterns of genomic variation, and
linking genotype to phenotype for traits of interest. The
ideal candidate will have a strong background in popula-
tion, conservation, or landscape genomics and signicant
experience in the analysis of large genomic datasets.
Research in the Nachman lab (https://-
www.nachmanlab.org/) focuses on population,
evolutionary, and ecological genetics and genomics. We
are broadly interested in the genetic basis of evolu-
tionary change, including the genetics of adaptation
and the genetic basis of speciation. For example, we
are interested in uncovering signatures of selection in
patterns of DNA sequence variation and in linking
specic genetic changes to specic adaptive phenotypes.
Much of the current work centers on the genetic basis
of adaptation to dierent environments. Our research
utilizes a wide range of methods and approaches
including eld studies, genetic crosses in the laboratory,
tools of molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics
analyses of large datasets.

Background Info: Research in the Whitehead lab
(https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) focuses on
evolutionary change in human-altered environments. We
seek applicants for a Postdoctoral Research Associate
to study population genetic change through space and
time in Pacic herring. The causes of the collapse of the
Prince William Sound (PWS) Pacic herring stock are
controversial, and the reasons for the lack of recovery
remain a mystery. We hypothesize that interactions
between the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and a subse-
quent viral epidemic were inuential. We have collected
whole genome sequences from ~1,300 individual sh
from across Alaska and across time (four times span-
ning three decades), and throughout the rest of their
range, to explore genomic change associated with the
collapse and the period since; with these data we seek
to explore and test hypotheses about the causes and
consequences of the collapse, and test hypotheses about
the genetic basis of parallel local adaptation. This huge
population genomics dataset is ready for the right can-
didate to make rapid progress. Data are collected, and
curated; we have a ltered variant data set where sum-
mary population genetics statistics have been estimated.
Collaborations are in place with scientists in academia
and with State and Federal agencies. The ideal candi-
date has experience in population genetics, statistical
genetics, and computational biology. We are especially
interested in candidates with a passion for open science
and for connecting their work to decision makers, the
public, and the broader conservation biology and evolu-
tionary biology communities. There is funding for one
year, with possibility of extension. We are open to the
candidate working remotely. Our group is committed
to creating a safe, inclusive, diverse, optimistic, and
equitable work environment.

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the LIVE ONLINE
course 'Introduction to Evolutionary Quantitative Ge-
netics'
Instructor: Dr. Erik Postma (University of Exeter, UK)
Dates: September 13th-17th, 2021 - 10:00-13:00 & 15:00-
18:00 (Madrid time zone)
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP is available for this course.
Deadline for scholarship applications is August 15th.
COURSE OVERVIEW:
The response to both natural and articial selection
critically depends on the additive genetic variances and
covariances underlying the traits subject to selection.
As a consequence, understanding the genetic basis of
complex morphological, life-history, physiological, or-
namental and behavioural traits is crucial if we are to
understand their evolutionary potential, and the evolu-
tionary process in general.
Quantitative genetics uses the phenotypic resemblance
among related individuals to infer the role of genes and
the environment in shaping phenotypic variation. De-
pending on the species, we can use data obtained from
breeding experiments under controlled conditions (e.g.
insects, plants), or from individual-based monitoring pro-
grams in the wild (e.g. birds and mammals). Especially
the latter has beneted greatly from the application
of animal model methodology, originally developed in
animal breeding to identify individuals of high genetic
merit. By simultaneously using the resemblance among
all individuals in the pedigree, these methods provide
more precise and accurate estimates of genetic and non-
genetic variance components (heritabilities and genetic
correlations). Furthermore, they allow for the estima-
tion of individual-level genetic eects (breeding values),
and thereby the inference of evolution.
In this course we will cover everything from basic quan-
titative genetic theory and statistics to advanced mixed
model-based approaches. You will learn how to estimate
genetic variances and covariances in wild and captivepopulations, and how to test for evolutionary change.
Along the way, you will be exposed to a range of general
statistical methods (including generalised and mixed
models), the R packages MCMCglmm and ASReml-R
in particular. Furthermore, we will discuss a number
of landmark papers that have put the concepts and
methods covered during the lectures and practicals into
practice to address fundamental evolutionary questions.
You are strongly encouraged to bring your own data
(if you have them), which you will be able to work on
during the course and which will allow you to put the
theory into practice.

Online, 1-4 November
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course55/ )
Instructor: Dr. Pietro Franceschi (Fondazione E. Mach,
Italy)
OVERVIEW: The aim of the course is to cover some
of the fundamental aspects of metabolomics from the
\data analyst" point of view. We will cover all the key
aspects which have to be considered to set-up a success-
ful metabolomics investigation, from the practical issues
related to study/analytical design to data pre-processing
and statistical analysis. The course will be delivered re-
lying on a mixture of lectures, computer-based practical
sections, and group discussions.
Prerequisites: Familiarity with R will be assumed. A
full day of the course will be however devoted to a fast
introduction to data carpentry and visualization in R.
A basic experience in metabolomics will be welcomed.

Online SpeciationGenomics Dec6-10
Dear all,
registrations are now open for our 5th edition of the
Speciation Genomics course with Dr. Mark Ravinet
(University of Nottingham, UK) and Dr. Joana I. Meier
(University of Cambridge, UK).
The course will be held online in December (
6th-10th): https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course37/ This course will provide a thor-
ough introduction to the growing eld of speciationgenomics. The course aims to take students from the
initial steps required for handling raw sequencing data
to demographic modelling and inference of genome-wide
signatures of selection and introgression. Through a
combination of lectures covering key theoretical and
conceptual topics, alongside hands-on exercises, partici-
pants will learn the most important computational ap-
proaches used in speciation genomics. This will include
a heavy emphasis on data visualization and intepreta-
tion. After completing of the course, the participants
should be able to begin using NGS data to shed light on
the genomic aspects of speciation in their study system
of choice.
Learning Outcomes:
1.Handling NGS data from raw reads to genetic variants
2.Applying basic population genetic statistics
3.Visualizing the genetic structure
4.Inferring demographic history
5.Identifying regions under divergent selection or barri-
ers to gene ow
6.Understanding the potential and limitations of dier-
ent methods to detect regions under selection

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
