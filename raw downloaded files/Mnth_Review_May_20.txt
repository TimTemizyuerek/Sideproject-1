Online Demographics
Dear Colleagues,
We resend the announcement for turning the
SMTDA2020 International Conference and Demograph-
ics2020 Workshop in Barcelona into a web-conference
the same dates and with the same program but via the
facilities of the virtual event.
It is a really dicult situation, but we urge all of you
to keep together via any means and by this virtual
SMTDA2020 conference.
We already have done the appropriate provisions for a
successful event (see details below). More information
in the web at www.smtda.net <http://www.smtda.net
>.
The deadline for reduced fees and Abstract or Paper
submissions is set at April 25, 2020, see at http://-
www.smtda.net/registrfeesexcursions.html and http://-
www.smtda.net/abstractsubmission.html .
Registration fee includes: License for virtual software
and training, download and participation in all virtual
sessions, e-book of abstracts and e-posters, power points
of presentations, full paper publication in proceedings,
and considered for the Communications in Statistics
Journals or in the ISTE-Wiley book publications or the
Springer book series.
We are sorry for the situation in Spain and in other
countries in the Globe and we wish strength and good
health to all of you and your families and friends.
All the best,
Prof. Christos H Skiadas
Dear Colleague,We are deeply concerned for the virus development in
connection to the conference activities and that the
World Health Organization has declared it a global pan-
demic.
We are quite sensitive to that constraint but equally
determined to ght against the diculties that emerged.
We are in front of the new challenges, a new historical
frame, new conditions of life.
Dear colleagues,
In these conditions, and following many requests
and after consulting the committee, we have turned
the conference into Virtual Conference in order from
the one hand to follow the international instructions
about the pandemic and the other hand to turn the
SMTDA2020 International Conference and Demograph-
ics2020 Workshop into a successful virtual international
event (www.smtda.net ).
So far the basis of the SMTDA and ASMDA Conference
series will remain unchanged including the Proceedings
and Publications in Books and Journals.
The web interactions, after the appropriate adaptations,
will join better the groups of colleagues forming streams
and workshops. A new challenge to open the interna-
tional travel barriers set to stop the coronavirus spread.
While the Conference dates remain unchanged, the early
registration deadline extended to 25 April including the
corresponding reduced fees for the virtual participation
(http://www.smtda.net/registrfeesexcursions.html ).
If you have already paid for the conference fees, you will
be issuing a refund for the dierence between the early
bird registration and virtual conference fee.
Special technical details and training will be provided
to participants before the conference and especially to
the Special, Invited Sessions and Workshop organizers
and Session Chairs.
Note that the power point of your presentation is
important for the Virtual Conference schedule. It
should be send to the secretariat for the session/s
chair as early as possible at secretariat@smtda.net
<mailto:secretariat@smtda.net >.
On behalf of the Conference Committee,
Prof. Christos H Skiadas,
Conference Chair
Over the years several Books from leading publishers
emerged from the SMTDA and ASMDA Conferences
and events.
I am happy to inform you that the basic details of the 2
collective volumes we have edited for iSTE WILEY as4 EvolDir May 1, 2020

Online EvolutionHIV May11-13
The 27th International Dynamics & Evolution of HIV
and Other Human Viruses conference will be held May
11-13, 2020 via webinar. This year will include a special
session on SARS-CoV-2.
This International Workshop brings together biologists
and immunologists working in viral pathogenesis with
applied mathematicians and statisticians. The meet-
ing fosters interdisciplinary collaboration and a new
generation of young talented researchers with the aim
to contribute to the understanding of HIV/AIDS and
other human viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 through re-
search that addresses the challenges of viral persistence,
evolution and genetics, changing human behavior, and
infection control.
It was designed to promote discussion between special-
ists in quantitative and computational approaches in
two areas in the eld of HIV and other human viruses
where these are particularly important:
Modeling of viral and cellular dynamics
Viral evolution and population genetics
We actively encourage participation by members of mi-
nority groups.

presentation). There will also be live sessions for distin-
guished talks and invited speakers for the whole confer-
ence.
Talks can be on unpublished work or work published
after January 1, 2019, and delivered by speakers at any
career stage.
The selection will be made by a committee chaired by
Lars Arvestad (Stockholm University) and Edward L.
Braun (University of Florida), based on the following
criteria: (i) signicance and novelty of the contribution;
(ii) completeness of the description of methods, data,
and analysis; (iii) quality of the presentation.

Genes as Environment: Indirect Genetic Eects in Evo-
lution, Agriculture, and Medicine
The American Genetic Association 2020 President's
Symposium has been rescheduled to take place Nov 15-
18, 2020. We will still hold the meeting in Snowbird,
Utah, but instead of spring owers, anticipate snow on
the mountaintops!
Early Registration will remain open until August 31st.
Student and postdoc AGA members receive free regis-
tration if they submit a poster abstract by then, and
have the chance to be selected for an oral presenta-
tion and $300 travel award. Poster abstracts from all
registrants will be accepted. AGA members receive
signicant discounts on symposium registration.
Social or indirect genetic eects (IGE) are genetic ef-
fects of an individual on the trait values of others in the
same species. IGE provides a unifying framework for
traditional quantitative genetics, maternal and paternal
genetic eects, inclusive tness, and multilevel selection.
We hold the friendliest symposia - small meetings in
lovely settings that provide great opportunities to inter-
act with the best in the eld.

CzechRepublic PopGenetics
PhD in Population Genetics and Community Ecology
We invite prospective candidates for a four-year fully
funded PhD Studentship to explore exciting questions
on the interface of population genetics and community
ecology. How is genetic variation maintained within
populations? And how do species coexist in diverse
communities? These are analogous major questions, but
are typically addressed separately. However, genetic vari-
ation is likely to have a key role in determining species
coexistence. Similarly, species diversity may improve
maintenance of genetic variation. The candidate will
investigate interactions between variation and diversity
using laboratory microcosm experiments, experimental
evolution and eld surveys. This collaborative project
utilizes a novel experimental community model system
of wild Drosophila species and their parasitoids from
tropical Australia. The student will be involved in ob-
taining live Drosophila and parasitoid lines from the
eld, and in analysing population genomic data.
The successful applicant will join the Laboratory ofExperimental Ecology [ http://lab.hrcek.net ] at the Bi-

ETH Zurich Evolution
The Computational Biology group in the Institute of
Integrative Biology at ETH Zurich, led by Joshua L.
Payne, is hiring two new Ph.D. students, with funding
for up to four years. The group is broadly interested
in evolution, particularly in the relationship between
genotype and phenotype, and the role of mutation in
the generation of adaptive phenotypic variation. We
study these topics at all scales of information trans-
mission from DNA to protein, with an emphasis on
transcriptional regulation. The PhD projects available
are centered around these topics.
We are looking for two highly self-motivated students
to join our team, which is currently made up of 2 PhD
students and one postdoc, with backgrounds in physics,
developmental biology, and evolution. The successful
candidates will have experience in some form of compu-
tational science, a passion for evolutionary biology, and
a masters in a related discipline (math, physics, CS, life
sciences...). Fluency in a major programming language
is essential, as is the ability to work independently. Ex-
perience modeling evolutionary processes or analyzing
large-scale biological datasets, such as from functional
genomics assays, is a plus.
We will begin considering applications on May 1st, and
will continue until the positions are lled. The earliest
possible start date is July 1st. Given the ongoing global
pandemic and the computational nature of the projects,
we may begin with home oce if the candidate already
resides in Switzerland.
To be considered, please send a single pdf le to
joshua.payne [at] env.ethz.ch including your CV, publica-
tion list, academic transcripts, a single-paged statement
of research interests, and contact information for 2-3
academic references. Please write GPMAP2020 in the
subject line.

ETH Zurich GenomicDiversity
Understanding the changes in genetic diversity in time
and space
A PhD position in population genomics is available in
the Plant Ecological Genetics group at ETH Zurich. The
aim of the project is to understand how anthropogenic
impacts (e.g. habitat fragmentation, disturbance or pol-
lution) shape genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity
and the genetic structure of populations in time and
space. It is well established that rapid environmental
changes pose a threat to biodiversity. In recent years,
much emphasis has been put on monitoring changes
in species and habitat diversity. At the same time, we
know much less about extant genetic diversity in natural
populations and how it has been aected both in time
and space by rapid environmental changes mediated by
human impact. However, genetic diversity is considered
a prerequisite for adaptation, and hence essential for the
long-term persistence of populations and species under
continuing environmental change. This PhD project
aims to identify drivers of changes in genome-wide
diversity and population genetic structure over time
and space in multiple plant (and potentially animal)
species using an individual whole-genome re-sequencing
approach. The sampling and analysis of extant popula-
tions will be complemented by a retrospective approach
in which the genetic diversity in historic herbarium or
museum specimens is analysed. This allows reconstruct-
ing changes in genetic diversity over at least one century
and may help identifying underlying factors driving
changes in genetic diversity over time and space. Based
on this knowledge, an applied goal is to develop con-
servation management strategies that prevent further
erosion of genetic diversity and maintain the adaptive
potential of populations and species.10 EvolDir May 1, 2020
For this project we seek highly motivated applicants
with a solid background in population and conserva-
tion genomics, evolutionary biology and bioinformat-
ics. Applicants are expected to work independently,
to communicate and collaborate with a wide diversity
of stakeholders and have strong analytical and writing
skills.
The PhD candidate is supervised by Dr. Martin C.
Fischer and Prof. Alex Widmer of the Plant Ecological
Genetics group at the Institute of Integrative Biology
at ETH Zurich, Switzerland (https://peg.ethz.ch). The
project is facilitated by access to state of the art infras-
tructure, including the Genetic Diversity Centre (http:/-
/www.gdc.ethz.ch/) and the Functional Genomics Cen-
ter Zurich (http://www.fgcz.ethz.ch/). The working
language is English, but advanced knowledge of Ger-
man and French is important for interactions with Swiss
stakeholders.
Applications consisting of a CV with names and contact
information for two references, publication list and a
motivation letter with a statement of research interests
(not longer than 2 pages) should be prepared as a single

antibiotic-resistance plasmids in microbial communities.
The project is funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation and runs for four years, starting as soon as
possible.
Our group studies microbial ecology and evolution in the
context of infectious disease. Current topics include the
evolution of antibiotic resistance and bacteria-virus in-
teractions. The group is collaborative, international andincludes researchers from a range of backgrounds. For
more information, see our webpage: https://pe.ethz.ch.
The group is is part of the Institute of Integrative Biol-

ETH Z urich is an equal opportunities employer.
Research topic: The overall aim is to gain new insights
into the spread of naturally occurring plasmids in multi-
species microbial communities, such as those in the
human gastrointestinal tract. We plan to do this by
measuring parameters that drive the spread of clin-
ical resistance plasmids in experimentally assembled
communities, and by tracking plasmids in species-rich

|Application deadline extended to 13th April 2020|
Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany Open PhD posi-
tion: Damage, immune defence and pathogen virulence
evolution Extended application deadline: 13th April
2020
The Evolution and Ecology of Insect Defences group at
the Institute of Biology, Freie Universitaet (FU) Berlin,
Germany, would like to invite applications for a Ger-
man Research Foundation (DFG) funded doctoral candi-
date position (TV-L E13, 65%) for the research project:
\Damage, immune defence and pathogen virulence evo-
lution: From the wild to the lab". The position is
xed-term and available for 4 years and it will start in
June 2020, or as soon as possible thereafter.
Project background Our research lies in the eld of eco-
evo-immunology (https://armitagelab.com/). To fully
understand immune defence variation and function it
is essential to consider the ecological context in which
defences are used and the evolutionary pressures placed
on them. Much of our extensive knowledge is from
carefully controlled laboratory-based studies, which is
quite dierent from the complex environments under
which the defences have evolved. Given rapid adap-
tation rates to lab conditions in short-lived insects, it
is relevant to connect insight from the lab with that
from wild organisms. To address this, in this project,
the successful candidate will sample ies (Drosophila
melanogaster) from the wild and examine their \natural
state", in terms of the degree of wounding that they
have been subjected to and their cuticular microbiota.
The latter will be identied and quantied using e.g.
16S rRNA metabarcoding. They will also ask how im-
mune defences of wild- and lab-bred D. melanogaster
dier in terms of resistance to bacterial pathogens, and
whether their associated cuticular microbiota aect the
virulence evolution of bacterial pathogens. A mathemat-
ical/statistical analysis will provide an understanding of
the drivers of the virulence data. The results will give
insight into variation in the natural selection pressures
placed upon the host, and inform us about how they
aect insect defences and pathogen virulence evolution.
The position is part of the \Insect Infect" Research Unit
funded by the DFG. The Research Unit will give the
opportunity for the candidate to interact with a diversegroup of doctoral candidates, post-docs and PIs, to
obtain methodological training, to collaborate with the-
oreticians, and to receive bioinformatics support. There
will be yearly retreats for Research Unit members and
access to a graduate training programme.
Requirements A completed University Master's degree
in biology.
Desirable - We would like applications from enthu-
siastic and highly motivated students with a back-
ground/strong interest in evolutionary ecology. - Lab-
oratory experience with bacteria and insects. - Good
basic knowledge of statistics and experimental design. -
Procient in spoken and written English. - Good team-
working and communication skills. - Ability to work
independently. - A European driving licence would be
an advantage. - Experience in collecting insects from the
wild. - Experience in molecular biology. - Completed
projects/internships on topics relevant to the research
area are advantageous.
How to apply Applications should be written in English
and include the following documents: (1) a cover letter
detailing your suitability and motivation to join the
research project (no more than one page), (2) a CV in-
cluding details of your research experience, the abstract
of your MSc thesis, and any publications, (3) the names

TardigradeEvolution
*PhD studentship in tardigrade evolution*
Fully funded 4-year PhD studentship in tardigrade evo-
lution at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow (Poland)
in the team of Dr. ukasz Michalczyk.
The main goal of the project is to test how reproductive
mode and cryptobiotic abilities aect dispersal and, in
consequence, speciation and extinction rates in tardi-
grades. Tardigrades are a phylum of microinvertebrates
that dwell a wide variety of habitats throughout the
globe. They are famous for their cryptobiotic abili-
ties that allow them to withstand extreme conditions
(including outer space) and are also thought to aid
dispersal of individual species. Moreover, tardigrades
exhibit various reproductive modes, including dioecy
and parthenogenesis. Theory predicts that both asexual
reproduction and cryptobiotic survival should increase
dispersal potential. On the other hand, both reproduc-
tive mode and dispersal abilities are hypothesised to
aect speciation and lineage extinction rates. Thus,
tardigrades are an interesting model to address some of
the fundamental questions of modern evolutionary biol-
ogy, biogeography and taxonomy such as mechanisms
underlying the evolution of biodiversity or evolution of
sex.
The successful candidate will be involved in extraction of
tardigrades from moss samples, slide preparation, mor-
phometrics and imaging in light microscope, processing
specimens for scanning electron microscope, karyotyping,
DNA extraction, amplication and multilocus sequenc-
ing (NGS), species identication, testing cryptobiotic
abilities, and taking care of tardigrade cultures. The
student will also analyse data and prepare drafts of
manuscripts, and will be involved in the promotion of
results at seminars and conferences.
The PhD programme in Biology at the Jagiellonian Uni-
versity is run entirely in English and it includes some
obligatory and facultative classes. The programme is
open to all nationalities and there are no tuition fees.
The PhD stipend is 4 |000 |PLN per month (typically,
cost of life in Krakow for a PhD student is ca. 2 |500
PLN/month).

Krakow OutbreakInsectGenomics
PhD Student position in Population genomics of out-
breaks
We are seeking a motivated PhD Student to join the
project \Genomics of population outbreaks in an emerg-
ing model system - neutral and adaptive evolution in
the spruce bark beetle", funded by the Polish National
Science Centre (NCN) SONATA BIS grant.
About the project
A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand
which processes shape genetic diversity observed in nat-
ural populations. Classic population genetic theory
provides a solid mathematical framework to study ge-
netic variation and predict ecacy of natural selection
relative to drift in equilibrium conditions, for example
under constant population size. However, the majority
of natural populations often experience large size uc-
tuations that make prediction less straightforward. The
main purpose of this project is to test how extreme uc-
tuations in population size of outbreaking species aect
the dynamics of neutral and adaptive genetic variation.
Many pests experience epidemic outbreaks characterized
by sudden changes in population size, often spanning
orders of magnitude. Such outbreaks are known from
ecological studies of closely monitored species of eco-
nomic importance. However, little is known about how
genetic variation changes during outbreak cycles. Specif-
ically, the rate of adaptive evolution during relatively
short periods of large population size remains unknown.
This can be studied in species which experience extreme
uctuations of population size, such as spruce bark bee-
tle (Ips typographus). Spruce bark beetle is the most
destructive pest of Norway spruce forests because under
specic conditions (e.g. storms) populations may out-
break, causing mass mortalities of spruce stands. We
will compare populations of spruce bark beetle that
have experienced frequent, recent outbreaks and popu-
lations that did not experience outbreaks in the recent
past. By combining existing knowledge on biology and
ecology of the species with newly generated, large-scale
genomic data, we will address specic questions about14 EvolDir May 1, 2020
the relationship between genome-wide variation and uc-
tuating eective population size: How outbreaks aect
species genetic structure? Are adaptations in frequently
outbreaking populations mainly driven by soft sweeps?
How demographic history of the spruce bark beetle and
historical uctuations of eective population size over
time aect current patterns of neutral and adaptive
variation and more.
The PhD student will be working with large, whole
genome resequencing data obtained from several pop-
ulations and >500 individuals. The samples are being
collected and the sequencing is planned for autumn
2020. Thus, the student will be able to work with the
data shortly after he/she starts his/her PhD studies.
The PhD student will analyse whole-genome variation
patterns including dierentiation, divergence and re-
combination rate variation along the spruce bark beetle
genome. The PhD student will also infer spruce bark
beetle's demographic history using coalescent-based sim-
ulations. The PhD student will gain a wide range of
scientic experience including genome-wide sequence
data analysis as well as demographic history modelling
and will be encouraged to develop his/hers own projects
using extensive datasets available.
About the place and salary
The student will be based at one of the top research in-
stitutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolution in Central
Europe - Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiel-
lonian University, Krakow, Poland ( www.eko.uj.edu.pl/-
enGB). Krakow is a beautiful city with a dynamic cul-
tural life (European City of Culture 2000; more than 100
festivals and other events organized every year; modern
museums, cinemas, theaters, restaurants etc). It has
good access to outdoor activities (biking, hiking and
more) and is well-connected to the rest of Europe.
The PhD student will be supported by a 48-month,
tax-free research stipend: 4500 PLN ( ~1050 EUR) per
month. This stipend may be combined with the stan-
dard PhD program scholarship (for those that will pass
the entrance exam to PhD graduate school at Institute
of Environmental Sciences, approximately 2200 - 3500
PLN). Note that in Poland, the living costs are rela-
tively low (check out a cost-of-living calculator such as
www.numbeo.com) and even without additional funding
from graduate school the salary is more than enough to

Vacancy description We are pleased to announce a PhD
fellowship for a highly motivated, enthusiastic and inde-
pendent person with a keen interest in the paleontology
of freshwater mollusks and their application to pale-
oenvironmental reconstruction through the integration
of taphonomy and sedimentary geology. Background
knowledge of evolutionary biology, morphometrics, eco-
logical data analysis, facies analysis, sequence stratigra-
phy and enthusiasm to participate to eldwork in Africa
are plus-points.
Project description Freshwater mollusks are common
in lakes, rivers and wetlands and, hence, they record
living conditions in continental hydrosystems. They
leave abundant fossil remains in the deposits of various
basins in the East African Rift, but despite their uniqueMay 1, 2020 EvolDir 15
potential to reconstruct paleoenvironments, including
those in which hominids evolved, they remain underuti-
lized compared to terrestrial vertebrates. We propose
a trans-disciplinary PhD project on the sedimentology,
taphonomy and paleontology of late Cenozoic mollusk as-
semblages of the Omo-Turkana Basin to reconstruct hy-
drosystems of the basin in space and time. Although the
basin harbored various paleolakes, it is unclear whether
changes in aquatic communities coincide with major
lacustrine transgressions and regressions, and how en-
vironmental change aected biotic communities. We
propose to study freshwater mollusk communities over
time from stratigraphically constrained shell beds to-
gether with depositional facies and basin-scale sequence
analysis.
Setting and requirements The project is funded by the
CNRS 80jPRIME initiative and will be developed in an
inter-institutional collaboration between the UMR 8198
Evo-Eco-Paleo of the CNRS and Lille University, the
European Centre for Research and Teaching in Environ-
mental Geosciences (CEREGE) in Aix-en-Provence and
the Institute for Earth Physics (UMR 7516) of the CNRS
and Strasbourg University. Furthermore, this project
is embedded in an ongoing GDR on the East African
Rift that brings together a larger research consortium.
Lille University is the diploma-granting institution for
this PhD project, so that the successful candidate will
be subscribed to a doctoral school of Lille University.
Master students that are graduating over the summer
are welcome to apply. More information on studying
at Lille University can be found on the Lille University
webpage: https://www.univ-lille.fr/home/international-

Project description Our team conducts research on
HLA1b molecules in alloimmunisation and inammation
(Carlini, Traore et al. 2013, Di Cristofaro, El Moujally
et al. 2013, Di Cristofaro, Reynaud-Gaubert et al. 2015,
Di Cristofaro, Reynaud-Gaubert et al. 2015, Carlini,
Ferreira et al. 2016, Di Cristofaro, Pelardy et al. 2016,
Carlini, Picard et al. 2017, Ribeyre, Carlini et al. 2018).
The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region
is the most studied genetic region of the human genome,
in large part thanks to the presence of classical HLA
class I (HLA-A, -B and -C) and HLA class II (HLA-DR
and -DQ) genes. Its huge genetic diversity is challenging
because of functional implication in many clinical elds
such as transplant and graft outcome, or viral escape.
However, this diversity also deeply contributed to an-
thropological science by helping to dene Homo sapiens
evolution and the earliest worldwide migration routes
(Parham 1993). Conversely, less is known about world-
wide genetic diversity and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
of non-classical HLA class I genes (HLA-E, -F and -G)
and of HLA class I pseudogenes. Among these, HLA-E
and -G are the most studied, both at genetic diversity
and at functional levels (Hviid and Christiansen 2005,
Kolte, Steensen et al. 2010).
Non classical HLA-E, -F and -G (HLA Ib) display spe-
cic features compared to classical HLA class I (HLA Ia)
such as very low genetic polymorphism and restricted
pattern of antigens presentation. Their role is not to
elicit an immune response but rather to inhibit its acti-
vation.
HLA-G modulates NK and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte me-
diated activity as well as B-lymphocyte proliferation
and is involved in epithelial cell dierentiation (Rouas-
Freiss, Goncalves et al. 1997, Allan, Lepin et al. 2002,
Howangyin, Loustau et al. 2012). Many diseases in-
volving immune tolerance were studied in regards to
HLA-G expression variation, especially in pregnancy
(Lynge Nilsson, Djurisic et al. 2014, Rebmann, da Silva
Nardi et al. 2014). Several studies associated genetic
polymorphisms both at coding level and in regulatory
regions with inter-individual expression variation (Reb-
mann, da Silva Nardi et al. 2014). HLA-G displays
ve main alleles with unequal worldwide distribution
(Castelli, Mendes-Junior et al. 2007, Carlini, Traore et
al. 2013, Castelli, Ramalho et al. 2014, Carlini, Ferreira
et al. 2016, Castelli, Gerasimou et al. 2017, Oliveira,16 EvolDir May 1, 2020
Veiga-Castelli et al. 2018, Sonon, Sadissou et al. 2018,
Castro, Issler et al. 2019).
HLA-E regulates natural killer cells (NK) and cyto-
toxic T-lymphocyte cells via its inhibitory receptor
CD94/NKG2 (Allan, Lepin et al. 2002, Pratheek, Nayak
et al. 2014, Celik, Kraemer et al. 2015). HLA-E mRNA
is expressed in most tissues (Heinrichs and Orr 1990) and
HLA-E is mobilized at the cell surface by leader peptides
of HLA Ia and HLA-G molecules. HLA-E also binds
peptide ligands from stress proteins and viruses (Foroni,
Couto et al. 2014, Kraemer, Blasczyk et al. 2014). The
two main HLA-E alleles, E*01:01 and E*01:03, display
similar frequencies worldwide, suggesting an advantage
for heterozygous carriers; E*01:03 is associated with
higher expression (Geraghty, Koller et al. 1992, Grim-
sley and Ober 1997, Felicio, Porto et al. 2014, Pabon,
Navarro et al. 2014, Olieslagers, Voorter et al. 2017,
Ramalho, Veiga-Castelli et al. 2017, Sonon, Sadissou et
al. 2018, Castro, Issler et al. 2019).
HLA-F mRNA is expressed in most cell types and the
protein is intracellular, and is mobilized at the cell sur-
face of activated monocytes, NK, B-lymphocyte and
T-lymphocyte (Lee, Ishitani et al. 2010, Goodridge,
Burian et al. 2013). HLA-F, expressed in an open
conformer form and whose function seems indepen-
dent of peptide loading (Boyle, Gillingham et al. 2006,
Goodridge, Lee et al. 2013) is implicated in immune
system regulation in pregnancy, infection, autoimmunity
and cancer, especially via its interaction with the in-
hibitory receptor KIR3DS1 (Burian, Wang et al. 2016,
Garcia-Beltran, Holzemer et al. 2016). HLA-F dis-
plays four alleles dened at second eld resolution, with
F*01:01 representing 90% of allelic diversity (Carlini,
Ferreira et al. 2016, Lima, Buttura et al. 2016, Buttura,
Ramalho et al. 2019, Castro, Issler et al. 2019).
HLA-H (formerly named HLA-12.4 or HLA-AR), lo-
cated at 55 Kbp away from the telomeric side of HLA-A,
is more related to HLA-A than to HLA-B or -C (Malis-
sen, Malissen et al. 1982, Zemmour, Koller et al. 1990)
and together with HLA-J and -G forms a group dened
as HLA-A related genes (Messer, Zemmour et al. 1992).
HLA-H has orthologs in chimpanzees, bonobos and go-
rillas, hence the separation between HLA-H and other
HLA-A-related genes predates the divergence of these
species (Lawlor, Warren et al. 1991, Adams and Parham
2001, Hans, Bergl et al. 2017). A proposed model of
evolution suggests the duplication of an ancestral MHC-
A/H block 30 million years

DarwinWaspMacroevolution
* DARWIN WASPS AND THE K-PG MASS EXTINC-
TION *
A PhD position in systematics and macroevolution is
available at the University of Bern and the Natural His-
tory Museum Basel. The project combines entomology,
palaeontology, molecular clock analyses, and computer
simulations to assess the impact of the K-Pg mass ex-
tinction event on Darwin wasps (Ichneumonidae), a
species-rich group of parasitoids.
Evidence of past mass extinctions is only conclusive for
groups with a dense fossil record, such as hard-bodied
marine taxa. Insects have been the most species-rich
taxon on earth ever since the Carboniferous, but our
knowledge of their fate during past mass extinctions is
limited by their capricious fossil record. Bayesian phylo-
genetic methods potentially allow estimating the impact
of mass extinction events on groups that do not fossilize
well, provided a well-dated phylogeny is at hand.
Our project aims to date the tree of life of Darwin wasps
using total-evidence dating, an approach that integrates
morphological and molecular data of extant and fossilMay 1, 2020 EvolDir 19
taxa. The wasp time tree will then be used to assess the
impact of the K-Pg extinction event on this group, which
is at the top of the insect food web. The project spans a
broad range of tasks, from analysing and describing new
fossil species, over coding morphological characters and
ltering next-generation sequencing data, to Bayesian
phylogenetic and macroevolutionary analyses.
We are looking for a highly motivated and versatile ap-
plicant with an interest in morphology, palaeontology,
and macroevolutionary inference. The PhD student will
be enrolled at the University of Bern and will work at
the Natural History Museum in Basel. He or she will be
supported by a postdoc and supervised by PI Seraina
Klopfstein. The position is funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation for four years.
Applications should include a brief CV, two references
with contact details, a publication list, and a motivation
letter detailing previous experiences with any of the
aspects of the project. Please send these documents in
a single PDF le to seraina.klopfstein@bs.ch. The dead-

j.tig.2019.12.003 Project Description
While most animal bodies are bilaterally symmetric on
the outside, the internal organs usually show a con-
sistent left-right (LR) asymmetry. Dening this LR
asymmetry is a critical part of early development, such
that left/right positional errors are an important class of
human birth defect, and in later life numerous diseases
aect apparently symmetric organs in an asymmetric
fashion. Yet, in trying to understand how this LR asym-
metry is established, it is straightforward to conceive
how the LR axis is dened relative to front/back and
top/bottom, but more dicult to comprehend how left
and right are consistently orientated in the same di-
rection. In the classic view, the solution is that LR
asymmetry is signalled by a chiral structure, the fabled
\F-molecule", which is directionally orientated relative
to the other axes.
To date, a wealth of studies have revealed the genes
that promote the propagation of asymmetric signals,
but the earliest LR symmetry-breaking events are not
clear. In seeking to understand if there is a common
pathway, an emerging consensus is that LR asymmetry
in diverse organisms originates from the cytoskeletal
dynamics that underlie the asymmetric behaviour of
individual cells Nonetheless, a central problem remains
- how and why are left and right consistently orientated
in the same direction? The main approach to under-
standing this invariance has been to use rare mutants
or manipulations in model animals (vertebrates, nema-
tode/y), to create individuals that are partly or wholly
orientated in the opposite direction. This methodology
has been fruitful, of course, but unfortunately, scientists
have largely ignored the only animal group - snails - in
which ordinary development can produce individuals
that are LR orientated in dierent directions. Studies
of LR asymmetry (\chirality") in snails may be key
to understanding how and why are left and right con-
sistently orientated in the same direction in nearly all
other animals. In this project, we propose to use as-
sociation mapping and long read genome sequencing
to identify the gene that underpins natural variation
in the LR asymmetry of Hawaiian snails of the genus
Lymnaea or Auricullela. This knowledge will then be
used to understand how molecular chirality denes the
LR asymmetry of cells, organs and bodies, with implica-
tions for understanding human health and development.
The project will involve cutting-edge methods in DNA
sequencing / bioinformatics, and may also require eld
or lab work in Hawaii.

StockholmU ButteryPlantEvolu-
tionaryGenomics
PhD position in Evolutionary genomics of buttery-
plant associations (deadline April 23)
A PhD position has been announced at the Department
of Zoology, Stockholm University, Sweden, as part of
the project \Evolving modularity in the adaptations
of phytophagous insects to their host plants", newly
funded by the Swedish Research Council.
The Department of Zoology is a vibrant international
community, consisting of ve interactive and collabora-
tive divisions: Ecology, Ethology, Functional Morphol-
ogy, Population Genetics, and Systematics and Evolu-22 EvolDir May 1, 2020
tion. The advertised PhD will be part of the Division
of Ecology.
The project aims to improve our understanding of the
causal mechanisms behind the evolutionary patterns
observed in insect-plant associations, and is based on
the idea that adaptations to specic host plants can
best be understood as \modules" of co-expressed genes
and the corresponding phenotypes { in particular larval
performance on dierent hosts.
Work in the PhD project will focus on butteries, and
will involve eld collection and laboratory rearing of in-
sects, including short-term selection experiments, as well
as genomic analysis of in particular RNA-sequencing
data. Experience from rearing and genomics of non-
model insects is thus particularly meriting.
The position is for four years full time, with salary and
social security. To be eligible you need a degree cor-
responding to at least four years of higher education,
including an independent project at an advanced level in
animal ecology, evolutionary biology or similar subject
(i.e. a Master's degree or similar).
The project will be supervised by Prof. S oren Nylin:

SalmonidImmunogenetics
Project title: Immunogenetic status of salmonid popu-
lations in Scotland
Institutions: School of Biological Sciences, University
of Aberdeen, and Marine Scotland Science Freshwater
Fisheries lab.
Supervisors: Stuart Piertney, Marius Wenzel, David
Morris, John Gilbey
Application: Deadline 1 May 2020 via Findaphd at
www.tinyurl.com/salmonPhD About the project
The genetic integrity of wild salmon in Scotland is be-
ing challenged by interaction with escaped farmed sh.
Gene introgression from farmed to wild sh can result
in genetic pollution of maladaptive alleles, the dilu-
tion and disruption of natural adaptive gene complexes,
and in declining populations the erosion of standing
genetic diversity which compromises the relationship
between genetic variation and resilience to immune in-
sult. Moreover, the spill over of pathogens and parasitesMay 1, 2020 EvolDir 23
from aquaculture can exert strong selective pressures
on wild individuals that drive selective sweeps within
populations, or expose wild sh to novel immunogenetic
challenge.
There is a recognised need to characterise im-
munogenomic diversity in wild Atlantic salmon around
Scotland, and examine how this is inuenced by inter-
action with aquaculture mediated by both gene intro-
gression and novel selection pressures. This project will
detail immune gene diversity in natural populations us-
ing multiple approaches including targeted sequencing of
key genes such as the MHC, and RADseq to identify ge-
nomic regions associated with immunological adaptation
to or elevated levels of population genetic divergence
consistent with the eects of directional selection. The
project will exploit two unique sample sets that allow
for assessment of both spatial and temporal variation in
immunogenetic diversity in salmon populations. First,
samples collected as part of the National Electroshing
Programme for Scotland (NEPS) that covers over 400
sites and 11,000 samples across Scotland. Second, his-
toric material (scales and tissue samples) held at Marine
Scotland Science Freshwater Fisheries Lab.
The studentship will be structured around key ques-
tions that include: How much spatial and temporal
immunogenetic variation exists among populations of
wild salmon in Scotland? Do the levels of diversity and
patterns of structure at adaptive immunogenetic mark-
ers mirror those observed for non-functional, neutral
markers? How much genetic introgression has there
been through escapes of farmed genetic variants asso-
ciated with pathogen resistance? Can signatures of
adaptation to pathogens associated with farming be de-
tected in wild populations? Are these signatures more
acute in areas associated with aquaculture? Does any
historical variation in the frequency of gene variants
associated with introgression or adaptation correspond
with farming activity?
It is an exceptional training opportunity for a student
to exploit leading edge molecular genetic approaches in
an applied context that interfaces with both industry
and conservation. You will be become part of a vibrant,
supportive and international research team, and receive
in-depth training in modern molecular and sequencing
techniques, bioinformatics and statistical modelling.
The student will also benet from wider interactions
with other projects funded by the Scottish Universities
Partnership for Environmental Research (SUPER) Doc-
toral Training Partnership (NERC) and collaboration
with the Marine Scotland Science freshwater sheries
laboratory.
Funding NotesThis project is funded by the SUPER-DTP and is avail-
able to UK/EU nationals who meet the RCUK eligibility
criteria. The studentship provides funding for tuition
fees, stipend and a research training and support grant,
subject to eligibility.

UGothenburg FlatOysterEvolution
Ph.D. candidate in molecular ecology of at oysters
The University of Gothenburg meets the challenges of
society with diverse knowledge. 47,500 students and
6,400 employees make the university a great and inspir-
ing workplace. Strong research and attractive programs
attract researchers and students from all over the world.
With new knowledge and new perspectives, the Univer-
sity of Gothenburg is contributing to a better future.
The Department of Marine Sciences (http://-
marine.gu.se) is Sweden's most complete marine
research and education environment, and is one of the
few such organizations in Europe. The Department of
Marine Sciences, established in 2015, brings together
expertise in physical oceanography, marine chemistry,
marine biology, marine geology and marine cultural
conservation. The department thus has excellent
conditions for meeting future challenges in marine
research and education. The Department of Marine
Sciences is located and has permanent sta in three
locations: in Gothenburg and at the research stations
Kristineberg and Tj arn o in Bohusl an.
Subject
Marine molecular ecology
Subject description
Although European at oysters (Ostrea edulis) consti-
tute a potentially important marine resource, and that
Scandinavian populations are still unaected by the
parasites that have decimated populations on the Euro-
pean mainland, little has been done to investigate where
there may be barriers to gene ow along the coasts of
Scandinavia, or if there are dierences in genetic di-
versity between geographic areas or local adaptations
to environmental factors. With new genomic methods,
there are now also excellent conditions for dramatically
increasing the understanding of the underlying factors
behind adaptations, and for predicting which factors
will be important for stocks when the marine environ-
ment changes in the future due to global environmental
changes (especially climate change and ocean acidi-
cation). This project is based on a combination of
eld studies, breeding of oysters and laboratory exper-
iments linked to genomic and bioinformatic methods
to increase the knowledge of at oyster ecology and
population genetics. The project is also linked to ma-rine management through the development of a better
classication scheme for management based on genetic
data.
Employment conditions
Applicants will work in an international research group
within a project aimed at investigating population struc-
ture, local adaptations, and resilience to global environ-
mental changes in European at oysters (Ostrea edulis)
in Scandinavia. This group includes researchers at the
Department of Marine Sciences, the Technical University
of Denmark, the University of Agder and the Swedish
Environmental Institute IVL.
The doctoral student is expected to work with com-
binations of eld and laboratory experiments of local
adaptations, tolerance to e.g. pH and temperature
changes, and to examine the genomic background to
dierences in tolerance levels between individuals and
between populations.
Eligibility
Basic qualications for postgraduate education is given
by: a completed degree at an advanced level, completed
course requirements of at least 240 higher education
credits, of which at least 60 higher education credits are
obtained at an advanced level, or in some other way in
or outside the country acquired essentially equivalent
knowledge.
The applicant must have an education in evolutionary
biology, evolutionary genetics or similar elds.
Evaluation criteria
Regulations for employment as a doctoral student are
found in Swedish Code of Statutes 1998: 80. Only those
who are or have been admitted to PhD-studies may be
appointed to doctoral studentships. When appointing,
the primary focus is on the ability of the student to take

and phenotypic diversity will Reverse to the genetic and
phenotypic diversity state of sampled reference popula-
tions. Briey, we plan to expose Daphnia populationsfrom dierent time periods to eutrophic and oligotrophic
conditions. We will measure genotype/allele frequencies
using whole genome pool sequencing, determine juve-
nile growth rates under standardized conditions as a
means to assess tness dierences, and collect samples
for phytoplankton dynamics. Further, to allow assess-
ment of a putative role of associated bacteria to aid
ecological adaptation, we will determine microbial com-
munity composition using 16S marker gene sequencing.

UManchester BirdsongEvolution
Modelling Birdsong Evolution at the University of
Manchester
In many bird species, young males learn their songs
from their fathers. But, learning occurs with error,
so songs can change over generations. This culturally
transmitted behaviour fascinates the public and has im-
portant implications for conservation. Birds use songs
to choose mates. If songs diverge among partly isolated
populations, this may prevent those populations from
exchanging genes and threaten species viability. Data-
driven mechanistic models of the evolution of birdsong
could help us understand birdsong evolution, but few
such models exist.
Birdsong evolution is in some ways analogous to genome
evolution. Notes are like nucleotides, and mutations(i.e.,
errors in copying) can change one note to another. Notes
or song segments can be inserted, deleted, or duplicated.
Tools from molecular phylogenetics may thus provide a
foundation for modelling such changes.However, there
are important dierences between genomes and bird-
songs. For example, individuals have a single genome,
but a bird may sing many dierent songs. Genomes
are comprised of only four dierent nucleotides, but
birdsongs may have more than four dierent notes, and
in principle entirely new notes can arise. Furthermore,
because changes between related birdsongs are more
common than genetic changes,aligning birdsongs for
study is dicult, and inferences may need to be drawn
from multiple possible alignments.Novel approaches are
needed to overcome these challenges.
The student on this PhD will develop new models to pre-
dict birdsong evolution. These models will help explain
how animal cultures evolve, and will have applications
for in situ and ex situ conservation. Students with
strong backgrounds in maths, physics, computer science,
or mathematical and computational approaches in their
own elds are particularly encouraged to apply.
The project will be advised by Tucker Gilman (Earth
and Environmental Science), Mark Muldoon (Mathe-
matics),and Pat Strycharczuk (Linguistics) at the Uni-
versity of Manchester, and Masayo Soma (Biology) at
the University of Hokkaido.
Applicants must be eligible to live and work in the
UK/EU. Please contacttucker.gilman@manchester.ac.ukwith questions, or for information on how to apply.

PhD Position in Evolutionary Epigenetics
A PhD position investigating the relevance of epigenetic
variation in natural populations to evolution is available
in the research group of Jochen Wolf at Munich Uni-
versity, Germany This project is part of a collaborative
eort involving several avian research groups in Europe.
Background
Since the merger of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian
hereditary principles at the onset of the 20th century,
genetic variation has been at the core of evolutionary
research. Genome-wide scrutiny of genetic variation
segregating in natural populations has provided funda-
mental insights into the evolutionary processes under-
lying adaptation and speciation. Yet, calls for incorpo-
rating epigenetic modications of the DNA blueprint
into an extended evolutionary synthesis have repeatedly
been made. And indeed, epigenetic variation consti-
tutes an important modier of phenotypic variation and
may promote plastic responses allowing populations to
explore novel niche space. Evolutionary relevance of
epigenetic modication, however, will depend on the re-
lationship between environmental inducibility and trans-
generational stability independent of the underlying
genetic variation. Comprehensive data on both of these
aspects are scarce.
The Project
The research program run by the successful candidate
proposes to ll this knowledge gap using a broad geo-
graphic sampling regime of over 2,400 individuals from
pedigree-informed natural populations of two avian
species as a model: the great tit, Parus major, and
the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus. Specically, we will
use this setup to characterize the intrinsic and external
forces shaping diversity in 5mC DNA methylation across
various scales of integration. First, we will quantify the
inheritance patterns of these epigenetic marks within
families (broods) leveraging additional power from ex-
tra pair young. Second, we will determine the extent
of population-level epigenetic variability across diverse
environments. Third, by adding populations of the Eu-
ropean crow, Corvus (corone) spp. we will assess the
degree of genetic and epigenetic divergence across 44
million years of evolution.
Qualications The successful applicant holds a master28 EvolDir May 1, 2020
degree in a relevant subject, has experience in popula-
tion genetics and/or comparative genomics and is skilled
in bioinformatic analyses of large genome-wide data sets.
Previous experience with epigenetic work is an asset.
Research environment of the host lab The Wolf lab
applies an integrative approach to explore micro-
evolutionary processes and genetic mechanisms under-
lying species divergence, adaptation and genome evolu-
tion (1, 2). Using large-scale genetic approaches, as
well as eld based experiments, we characterize ge-
nomic divergence across populations and (sub-)species
and assess its relationship to phenotypic divergence
(3) - sometimes with an applied angle (4, 5). In addi-
tion, we explore methodological aspects of data anal-
yses (6, 7) and engage in comparative approaches to
study evolution across larger timescales (8, 9). Em-
pirical systems currently include natural populations
of birds (swallows, cuckoos and corvids (10-14)), ma-
rine mammals (pinnipeds and killer whales) (15, 16)
and, recently added, the European hemiclonal water
frog system and ssion yeast (17, 18). More infor-
mation on the research activities in the lab can be
found at http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/j wolf/-
index.html . The University of Munich is consistently
ranked among the top Universities worldwide, in par-
ticular the life science branch with its newly inaugu-
rated campus oering excellent technical facilities and
many interaction possibilities including the gene cen-
ter, several Max-Planck-Institutes and the Helmholtz
Centre (http://www.campusmartinsried.de/en/336-2/-
#). With the highest concentration of supercomputing
in Germany the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre and
its local partners provide access to state-of-the art com-
puting facilities (https://www.lrz.de/english/). Munich,
Bavaria's capital, is a vibrant, yet relaxed city with
many traditions still alive, a high quality of living and
the Alps nearby.
How to apply Applications including a CV, a state-
ment of motivation and the contact details of at least
two references in a single .pdf should be sent to evo-
lution@bio.lmu.de. Please use 'epigenetic position' as
subject header. The position remains open until lled,

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The selected student
will work with Dr. Salvatore Cozzolino (https://-
www.docenti.unina.it/salvatore.cozzolino) on a research
project entitled \The contribution of plastic and hered-
itable components in scent emission for shaping species
distribution and speciation in sexually deceptive or-
chids"
We are interested in how diversity evolves and under-
standing the processes and factors that determine the
spatial distribution of species on the planet. By us-
ing one of the most evolutionary successful families of
owering plants, the orchids, as a study system, we
are addressing a set of inter-related questions about
species sorting/species coexistence and competition. In
particular, by focusing on sexually orchids, oral scent
traits modulating adaptations to pollinators as well as
their molecular bases will be studied using selection
analysis, phenotyping (particularly for oral volatiles)
and segregation analyses. We are particularly interested
in how plasticity and hereditability of scent emission
in sexually deceptive Ophrys allows the potential for
rapid adaptation to local pollinator. This is a central
issue for species radiation but also for rapid adaptive re-
sponse to climate changes. POSITION CHARACTER-
ISTICS: The Department of Biology in Naples (http://-

Open PhD position Sexual signals in hermaphroditic
worms and their evolution during the transition between
hermaphroditism and separate sexes
Application deadline: May 31st 2020
Applications are invited for a PhD candidate position
funded by the University of Sorbonne Paris Nord for
the research project: \ Sexual signals in hermaphroditic
worms and their evolution during the transition between
hermaphroditism and separate sexes". The position is
funded for 3 years, starting on September 2020.
Project background Sexual selection is a central topic
in behavioral ecology and is usually associated with
male and female reproductive success. Communication
between the two sexes is crucial at the moment of repro-
duction; a huge amount of research has focused on sexual
signals, such as sexual pheromones, visual displays and
bodily parades that males and females use in the con-
text of mating. Although the majority of animals have
separate sexes, hermaphroditism is almost ubiquitous
among animal taxa and more than 65000 hermaphroditic
species exist. Hermaphroditic organisms have the two
sexual functions tied together in the same body, and pro-
duce female and male gametes either at the same time
(simultaneous hermaphrodites), or at dierent times
during their life (sequential hermaphrodites).
How does communication between sexes work in
hermaphroditic species where individuals need to mate
with partners to fertilize their eggs? What implications
the hermaphroditic lifestyle has on signals and cues used
to attract mates? What quality are hermaphrodites
advertising to their partners? Given their two sexual
functions, what information are hermaphrodites signal-
ing to attract mates, and what sex are they advertising
the most? At what extent do sexual signals produced by
hermaphrodites convey honest information as opposed30 EvolDir May 1, 2020
to manipulative substances to force partners into over
expressing the less preferred sex? These questions have
been rarely addressed in sexual selection research. This
timely PhD project plans to meet these goals using the
polychaete worms of the genus Ophryotrocha as biolog-
ical models. This genus includes simultaneously and
sequentially hermaphroditic species (all strictly unable
to self), as well as species with separate sexes, making
it possible to explore the evolution of sexual signals as
sexual systems diversify.

(WZ/ZZ). Unlike in other WZ/ZZ taxa, sex chromosome-
autosome fusions are common in Lepidoptera, which
makes them ideal model system for investigations into es-

research museum collection manager -fungi Job Sum-
mary The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology (EEB) is seeking a Collection Manager of Fungi.
The fungarium is part of the larger MICH Herbarium
(https://lsa.umich.edu/herbarium), located at the new
state of the art Research Museums Center (RMC) in
Ann Arbor, Michigan. The MICH fungarium develops
and maintains fungal collections explicitly for use in
research and education and facilitates specimen-based
research on campus and at other institutions. EEB
has an outstanding, diverse and collaborative group of
researchers in evolutionary biology, ecology, and biodi-
versity science.
The MICH fungarium contains ~280K preserved fungal
specimens, which have been largely digitally databased.
The fungarium is extraordinarily strong in North Amer-
ican higher fungi, with, among others, the collections
of A. H. Smith (agarics, boletes, and gastromycetes),
C. H. Kauman (agarics), D. Baxter (polypores), R. L.
Shaer (agarics), and R. Fogel (hypogeous fungi). The
personal herbarium of F. K. Sparrow, which contains
mostly specimens of the parasitic genera PhysodermaMay 1, 2020 EvolDir 43
and Urophlyctis as well as a microscope-slide collection
of aquatic fungi, is also included. The fungarium has
recently developed a cryopreserved collection of living
zoosporic true fungi (https://czeum.herb.lsa.umich.edu)
which represents the largest collection of chytrid fungi,
including hundreds of strains of the amphibian pathogen
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The collection man-
ager will also be responsible for maintenance of use of a
collection of ~57K lichen specimens.
We seek candidates with a strong commitment to cu-

I sent this message yesterday and neglected to

D48viuKYRm?amp=1 If you're overwhelmed right now
(as many of us are) and have no interest in taking on
anything extra, stop reading this. However, if you're in
a position to play with a bit of data to distract yourself
from the troubles of the world, read on.
Have you ever wondered to what extent results in evo-
lutionary biology and ecology vary just because of the
choices we make when processing and analyzing data?
If so, we invite you to help us nd out by analyzing adata set that many other evolutionary biologists and
ecologists are also analyzing. We estimate that the
analysis will take about a day of your time. However,
your single analysis (completed sometime in the next
three months or so) will earn you co-authorship on our
paper titled \Same data, dierent analysts: variation
in eect sizes due to analytical decisions in ecology and
evolutionary biology" (this paper is already provision-
ally accepted at BMC Biology through a new publishing
model known as registered reports, where peer review
occurs prior to study implementation).
If you think this project is interesting, but you'd rather
not take on a data analysis, we're also recruiting people
to peer review the contributed analyses. Ideally, each
peer reviewer will review four analyses. These internal
peer reviewers are also invited to be co-authors (by the
way, identities of people conducting specic analyses or
peer reviews will not be shared, so even if you join the
project as a co-author, your name will not be linked to
a particular analysis or review).
We want people from across the spectrum of experience
and expertise 'V we would love to include anyone who
would analyse ecological or evolutionary data for their
work (including grad students).
If you participate, you have a choice between two data
sets, each with its own question. The two questions are:
1) \To what extent is the growth of nestling blue tits
(Cyanistes caeruleus) inuenced by competition with sib-
lings?" 2) \How does grass cover inuence Eucalyptus

Evolution board game
Dear Evoldir members, A few weeks ago, I released
a free educational board game about climate change
and evolution inspired by the work of the Evolutionary
Ecology group at the University of Cambridge (http://-
www.eeg.zoo.cam.ac.uk/).
Everything needed for the game can be freely down-
loaded at the link https://michelaleonardi.netsons.org/-
climate-change-board-game/ The idea is to let the
player experience life as a medium/large mammal species
in a word where climate changes unexpectedly. Every
species has its DNA and collects mutations through time,
allowing it to adapt to new habitats. Sometimes evolv-
ing is not an option, and the species must migrate or go
extinct. It is also possible to integrate human-associated
climate changes.
It has been designed as an educational resource for
schools (groups of 4-5 people, with an approximate du-
ration of 30 minutes to leave space for discussion and
questions): we have used it successfully to do outreach
at the Museum of Zoology, University of Cambridge.
Still, it can also be played with friends and family.
At the moment it is available in English and Italian, a
Portuguese (Brazilian) version of it will be also uploaded
shortly.
Please, feel free to use it for educational purposes or
for fun, and to get in touch for questions or comments.48 EvolDir May 1, 2020

Dear colleagues,
It is our great pleasure to announce the publication of
the Open Access book \Phylogenetics in the Genomic
Era":
https://hal.inria.fr/PGE/ The book covers various as-
pects of phylogenomics, from concepts and algorithms
to programs and applications.
It is freely available as a pdf, downloadable as a single
document or chapter by chapter. We hope to oer a
print-on-demand option soon. Prots, if any, will be
directly re-invested in the Peer Community In initiative
(https://peercommunityin.org/).
We're very proud of the content, and also of the proof of
concept that much can be done without the (expensive)
services of professional publishers. We would like to
thank all the authors for their tremendous contributions
to this collaborative eort.

Quantitative Genetics
ANNOUNCEMENT:
*Quantitative Genetics - Cambridge University Press*
*Armando Caballero*
Quantitative genetics is the study of continuously vary-
ing traits, which make up the majority of biological
attributes of evolutionary and commercial interest. This
book provides a much-needed up-to-date, in-depth yet
accessible text for this eld. In lucid language, the
author guides readers through the main concepts of
population and quantitative genetics, and their applica-
tions. Written to be approachable to even those without
a strong mathematical background, applied examples,
a glossary of key terms, and problems and solutions,
support students in grasping important theoretical de-
velopments and their relevance to real-world biology.
An engaging, must-have textbook for advanced under-
graduate and postgraduate students. Given its applied
focus, it also equips researchers in genetics, genomics,
evolutionary biology, animal and plant breeding, and
conservation genetics, with the understanding and tools
for genetic improvement, comprehension of the genetic
bases of human diseases, and conservation of biological
resources.

SSE IntlEventGrants DeadlineExt
Jun1
In light of the uncertainties around event planning for
the next few months, the Society for the Study of Evo-
lution (SSE) International Committee has extended the
deadline for two of their grants.
A message from the International Committee:
\Due to uncertainties concerning the COVID-19 pan-
demic, its potential impact on scientic events, and its
distressing eects on our communities, we are extend-
ing the application deadline for these grants to June 1,
leaving more time for organizers to adjust to the current
situation and have a better vision about the future. We
are also happy to consider applications at any time as
long as our budget for the year has not been entirely
spent. We will also consider applications for virtual
conferences and remote events. If an event has been
approved for funding and needs to be postponed, we can
arrange to reimburse the organizers once the meeting
has actually taken place."
1. \Co-sponsorship of symposia organized by non-US
evolution societies" The goal of this award is to fos-
ter communication between scientists from dierent
countries by stimulating scientic dialogue through co-
sponsored symposia. Evolution societies with limited
nancial resources will have the opportunity to invite
speakers who are SSE members to their meeting. This
will provide growth opportunities for both societies,
since it will not only benet the hosting society but
also create opportunities for new collaborations for the
invited speakers.
New deadline: June 1, 2020
More information: https://bit.ly/2RgjTV3 2. \Evo-
lution International Events Award" These events are
aimed at furthering the purpose of SSE by fostering
international collaborations amongst evolution oriented
societies and scientists. Eligible events would include
specialized symposia, workshops and short courses in
any aspect of evolutionary biology. The events could be
hosted either in the US or abroad and preference should
be given to events that specically include participants
from countries other than the USA.

about multifactorial genetics (e.g., GxE, GWAS). The
primary duties and responsibilities include developing
these interventions, using surveys to measure thinking
about genetic determinism in undergraduate students
from several institutions, deploying these interventions
in multiple classrooms using randomized controlled tri-
als, conducting think-aloud interviews with undergrad-
uate students, analyzing data from the interventions,and helping to develop curricular materials that address
ndings in the study. The successful candidate will
also disseminate the results through publications and
presentations at meetings.
Discipline-based education research is growing at Cor-
nell, with faculty and collaborators in physics, biology,
and other STEM elds, as well as a number of new post-
docs, graduate and undergraduate student researchers.
The successful candidate will have an opportunity to
mentor and work with many individuals and participate
in weekly education journal clubs and research meetings
with the larger EEB and Cornell community.
Preferred qualications include:
- Ph.D. in biology, genetics, biology education research,
or closely related eld
- Experience with relevant literature and education re-
search methods, expertise in quantitative research meth-
ods and statistics (prociency in multilevel statistical
modeling using R, STATA, SAS, or HLM), and ex-
perience with qualitative research approaches such as
conducting interviews with students using think-aloud
protocols
- Knowledge of and experience with the eld of genetics
(e.g., GxE, GWAS)
- Ability and desire to work collaboratively, mentor
graduate and undergraduate students, and to also work
independently
- Project leadership, time management, communication,
and writing skills
The Postdoctoral Associate will be appointed for a one-
year period with the possibility of extension for two
additional years based on satisfactory performance.

CzechRepublic PopulationGenetics
Postdoc in Population Genetics and Community Ecol-
ogy
A three-year Postdoc position is available for a highly
motivated candidate to help explore the interface be-
tween population genetics and community ecology. The
processes that maintain genetic variation in populations
and allow species to coexist in diverse communities are
likely to interact, but are typically addressed separately.
However, genetic variation is likely to have a key role
in determining species coexistence. Similarly, species
diversity may improve maintenance of genetic variation
within interacting populations.
The postdoc position is part of a frontier, high-level
funding from 2020 to 2025 (ERC-CZ grant). The can-
didate will lead the population genomics aspect of the
project, which includes laboratory microcosm experi-
ments, experimental evolution, eld surveys and eco-
logical modelling. This collaborative project utilizes a
novel experimental community model system of wild
Drosophila species and their parasitoids from tropical
Australia. We will sequence genomes of ve Drosophila
and ve parasitoid species and use whole genome geno-
typing to quantify changes in genetic variation and link
host resistance phenotypes to their associated genotype.
There will also be opportunities to develop the project
in a direction of the candidate's own choosing.
The successful applicant will join the Laboratory of
Experimental Ecology [ http://lab.hrcek.net ] at the Bi-
ology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ceske Bude-
jovice, Czech Republic, under the supervision of Dr Jan
Hrcek. The laboratory is a multinational team of PhD
students, postdocs and technicians and the applicant
will have the opportunity to work extensively with other
team members. The laboratory can provide substantial
resources and support for exceptional research. The lab-
oratory is part of the Department of Ecology, a dynamic
international centre for research on interaction networks,
with regular publications in leading journals. Further,the candidate will collaborate within a wide network of
the PI's collaborations and establish new links for this
project.
The review of applications will begin on 10th June 2020
and will continue until the position is lled. The salary
of 50.000-60.000CZK/month gross + benets more than
comfortably covers living expenses in Ceske Budejovice
and international holiday travel. Further, there will

ETH Zurich MicrobialEvolution
Postdoc Position in Microbial Evolution at ETH Z urich
The Pathogen Ecology group at ETH Z urich seeks a
postdoctoral researcher to join our team for a project
investigating antibiotic-resistance plasmids in microbial
communities. The project is funded by the Swiss Na-
tional Science Foundation.
Our group studies microbial ecology and evolution in the
context of infectious disease. Current topics include the
evolution of antibiotic resistance and bacteria-virus in-
teractions. The group is collaborative, international and
includes researchers from a range of backgrounds. For
more information, see our webpage: https://pe.ethz.ch.
The group is is part of the Institute of Integrative Biol-
ogy at ETH Z urich (https://ibz.ethz.ch).
We are looking for a highly motivated researcher who
can develop projects, carry out experiments, analyze
and communicate the results, and interact with other
scientists with a high degree of independence. Appli-
cants must have a PhD in a relevant discipline and
excellent communication skills in English. Advanced
knowledge of microbiology, molecular biology, bioinfor-
matics, genomics or evolution will also be advantageous.
The position is for two years. ETH Z urich is an equal
opportunities employer.
Research topic: The overall aim is to gain new insights
into the spread of naturally occurring plasmids in multi-
species microbial communities, such as those in the
human gastrointestinal tract. We plan to do this by
measuring parameters that drive the spread of clinical
resistance plasmids in experimentally assembled commu-
nities, and by tracking plasmids in species-rich commu-
nities sampled from human gut microbiomes. By doing
so, we hope to learn something new about the role of
interspecic interactions in the spread of mobile genetic
elements, and to identify reservoir species/strains for
clinically important plasmids. The postdoc will work on
some of these objectives, collaborate with other group
members, and potentially develop other related projects.

toral research position at the Institute of Biology of the
Ecole Normale Superieure (IBENS) in Paris, France.
Position is for two years, with possibilities for extension.
Start date: from July 1rst 2020, exible.
We are hiring an enthusiastic postdoc to work with Dr
Camille Berthelot on ERC Starting Grant EVOMENS,
which seeks to understand how menstruation evolved in
the primate uterus. Menstruation is a recent evolution-
ary innovation in primates: the trait is present in some
species (humans, baboons) but not in closely related oth-
ers (vervets). The molecular and genetic bases of men-
struation are not fully understood, despite its involve-
ment in critical gynecological conditions. EVOMENS
aims to prole cellular populations, gene expression and
gene regulation in the uterine lining of several primates
across the female hormonal cycle to characterize how
menstruation evolved at the functional level. The post-
doc will be in charge of functional genomics experiments
(single-cell transcriptomics, cell sorting, cell population
RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) and data analysis.
Applicants must have a PhD degree or equivalent, or
have submitted their thesis at the time of applica-
tion. The applicant should have wet-lab experience
relevant to the project such as functional genomics ex-
periments, transcriptomics, experimental genetics, cell
sorting and/or cell culture. Computational experience
is appreciated, but not required - however, the success-
ful candidate will be expected to develop that skillset
and will receive appropriate support. The postdoc will
also be expected to write manuscripts, deliver research
presentations and be involved in the daily life and man-
agement of the laboratory.
The postdoc will join the Dynamics and Organisation
of Genomes laboratory, located at the Institute of Biol-
ogy of the ENS. ENS is a prestigious university with a
vibrant academic life and is part of the Paris Sciences

JagiellonianU TardigradeEvolution
*PostDoc position in tardigrade evolution*
A 3-year postdoctoral position in tardigrade evolution
at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow (Poland) in
the team of Dr. ukasz Michalczyk.
The main goal of the project is to test how reproductive
mode and cryptobiotic abilities aect dispersal and, in
consequence, speciation and extinction rates in tardi-
grades. Tardigrades are a phylum of microinvertebrates
that dwell a wide variety of habitats throughout the
globe. They are famous for their cryptobiotic abili-
ties that allow them to withstand extreme conditions
(including outer space) and are also thought to aid
dispersal of individual species. Moreover, tardigrades
exhibit various reproductive modes, including dioecy
and parthenogenesis. Theory predicts that both asexual
reproduction and cryptobiotic survival should increase
dispersal potential. On the other hand, both reproduc-
tive mode and dispersal abilities are hypothesised to
aect speciation and lineage extinction rates. Thus,
tardigrades are an interesting model to address some of
the fundamental questions of modern evolutionary biol-
ogy, biogeography and taxonomy such as mechanisms
underlying the evolution of biodiversity or evolution of
sex.58 EvolDir May 1, 2020
The successful candidate will be involved in laboratory
work (extraction of tardigrades from moss samples, slide
preparation, morphometrics and imaging in light mi-
croscope, processing specimens for scanning electron
microscope, karyotyping, DNA extraction, amplication
and multilocus sequencing (NGS), species identica-
tion, testing cryptobiotic abilities, and taking care of
tardigrade cultures) and in data analysis (mostly phy-
logenetic and phylogeographic analyses) as well as in
preparation of manuscript drafts and in the promotion
of results at seminars and conferences.
The salary is ca. 4 |500 |PLN per month after tax
(typically, cost of life in Krakow for a single young person
is ca. 3 |500 PLN/month).

UManitoba SturgeonEvolution
Postdoctoral Position in Sturgeon genomics and tran-
scriptomics
Under the Canadian Species At Risk Act the Commit-
tee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada
(COSEWIC) recently rearmed their recommendation
that Lake Sturgeon be listed as endangered or of special
concern across Canada. Three of the four designatable
units of Lake Sturgeon populations in Canada are found
in Manitoba and an intensive research eort supported
by NSERC and Manitoba Hydro in partnership with in-
digenous stakeholders, conservation groups, and provin-cial and federal legislative bodies has been ongoing for at
least the last ve years forming part of a long-term com-
mitment to augment, conserve and sustain populations
of Lake Sturgeon throughout the province and North
America. Understanding underlying genetic variation
within these populations is key to the success of this
research eort. In collaboration with colleagues from
UC Davis this research will develop tools to sequence,
assemble and annotate the polyploid genome of Lake
Sturgeon providing a valuable resource for understand-
ing phenotypic development during early life history and
therefore development of appropriate rearing practices
for stock enhancement programs.
A maximum of four years of funding is available for a
post-doctoral salary commensurate with NSERC guide-
lines. This position will be responsible for directing
genome sequencing, assembly and annotation of the
lake Sturgeon genome. Additionally, existing transcrip-
tomic datasets will be available for assessment of tran-
scriptomic responses to environmental factors in Lake
Sturgeon related to growth and regulation of pH balance.
The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary
research team examining environment phenotype inter-
actions during early life history and developing tools for
improving our use of eDNA and elemental signatures to
understand eectiveness of stock enhancement strategies
in the conservation of this ancient species. Extensive
knowledge and experience in the use of bioinformatic
tools is an essential for this position, prior experience in
working with polyploid datasets is a distinct asset. Inter-
ested candidates should email a cover letter and CV to

HostMicrobeInteractions
University of Pittsburgh - Postdoc in Host-Micobe In-
teractions
The lab of Dr. Kevin Kohl (University of Pittsburgh)
is looking to recruit a postdoctoral researcher focused
on the ecology/evolution of host-microbe interactions,
using approaches of integrative and systems biology.May 1, 2020 EvolDir 65
The concept of phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of a
single genotype to produce varying phenotypes depend-
ing on the environment, is a central focus of biology.
However, animals are not a \single genome" in that
they also maintain intimate associations with complex
communities of microbes. It has been proposed that the
genomes of hosts and associated microbes should be com-
bined into a wholistic \holobiont" and \hologenome",
upon which natural selection acts. Yet, our knowledge
of how the microbiome contributes to host plasticity
remains poorly understood.
This critical gap will be addressed by experimentally de-
termining how the microbiome and rodent host species
interactively inuence animals' physiological responses
to variation in diet. This project will test whether gut
microbial communities contribute to phenotypic traits
and dierential host phenotypic plasticity across organ-
isms by conducting microbial transplants into germ-free
mice and inventorying aspects if host and microbial
physiology at numerous levels of biological organization
(gene expression, enzyme activities, whole-system per-
formance metrics). Data integration will be a crucial
aspect of this project, and so applicants experienced
in systems biology or computational approaches are
especially encouraged to apply.
This position will also provide opportunities for mentor-
ing undergraduates, conducting scientic outreach, and
designing and implementing allied side projects tailored
to the skills and interests of the postdoctoral researcher.
This position is for one year, with renewal for a second
year given sucient progress. Start date is negotiable
but expected to be late summer/fall 2020.

Project description: Stochastic models have a strong
tradition in population genetics. Diusion and branch-
ing processes are frequently used to describe evolution
forward-in-time. At the same time, birth-death pro-
cesses such as the coalescent are used to track evolu-
tion backward-in-time. Duality relationships between
forward-in-time and backward-in-time models have been
established and analysed. Together, such mathematical
treatment has led to a large body of theoretical popula-
tion genetics and promoted our general understanding
of evolution.
Building on concepts of theoretical population genet-
ics, we have formulated a time-dependent Poisson ran-
dom eld model that permits describing allele fre-
quency trajectories in nonstationary populations (doi:
10.1016/j.tpb.2016.06.003). This has, for example, en-
abled us to formulate an analytical description of the
joint allele frequency spectrum of two populations dur-
ing the process of speciation, and investigate the impact
of incomplete lineage sorting on genomic signatures of
natural selection.
The project prots from an interdisciplinary collabora-
tion between the Department of Ecology and Genetics
and the Department of Mathematics at Uppsala Univer-
sity.
Duties: Several extensions of the basic model of allele
frequency evolution are of interest, such as dependence
among allele frequency trajectories due to physical link-
age and recombination. A relevant body of population
genetics models that address recombination exists the
sequential Markovian coalescent, the ancestral recom-
bination graph and diverse branching process models.66 EvolDir May 1, 2020
The Postdoc project will start by investigating possibil-
ities of integrating such models of recombination into
the forward-in-time model of allele frequency evolution,
which has been formulated by our group. In particu-
lar, analytical results on the allele frequency spectrum
(AFS) in the presence of physical linkage are of interest.
Ultimately, the derivation of such an AFS shall form
the basis to analytically investigate the relationship be-
tween the recombination rate and measures of natural
selection, which is a central question in evolutionary
biology.
Qualications required: For this position, the candidate
must hold a PhD degree within mathematics, evolu-
tionary biology, bioinformatics or another relevant eld.
The Postdoc candidate must have experience in mathe-
matical biology and interest in population genetics. The
candidate must be able to express themselves uently
in spoken as well as written English. In addition, the
applicant must be able to work independently, have
good collaborative skills and be able to communicate
(both spoken as well as written). The applicant must
have integrity and personal maturity, be able to take
initiative and to handle setbacks.
To be eligible the candidate must have a PhD degree, or
a foreign degree equivalent to this, completed less than
three years before the application deadline. The three
year period can be extended due to circumstances such
as sick leave, parental leave, duties in labour unions,
etc.

PopulationGenomics
In light of the past month's upheaval, I would like to
clarify that: * This position described below remains
open through May 1. * Start date is still exible. * It
should be possible to start work on a remote basis for
the rst few months if travel is not yet possible.
The research group of John Pool at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison invites applications for a postdoc-
toral research position. There are multiple potential
project areas, with an overarching theme of addressing
big questions in population/evolutionary genetics. I'd
like to give the successful candidate for this position a
strong voice in shaping their research direction in the
lab.
Potential research areas could include (but are not lim-
ited to):
* Model Inference for the Genetic Architecture of Adap-
tive Evolution When traits evolve in nature, we'd like
to understand things like how many genes are involved,
whether selection acts on standing variation or new mu-
tations, whether it ultimately xes the causative vari-
ants. We focus on local adaptation among Drosophila
melanogaster populations from contrasting natural envi-
ronments, which provides a powerful and ecient system
for investigating these questions. One particular oppor-
tunity is to make statistical inferences about the genetic
architecture of adaptation, in part from existing QTL
mapping data.
* Fundamental Population Genetics We are interested
in leveraging big data (such the >1000 genomes from
our Drosophila Genome Nexus) to ask basic population
genetic questions. Our lab is especially interested in
leveraging genetic dierentiation between populations
to address classic but unresolved questions about the
inuence of natural selection on genomic diversity.
* Quantifying Adaptive Potential It is widely recog-
nized that genetic diversity is a primary determinant
of whether populations can rapidly adapt to new chal-
lenges. Yet in spite of its relevance to basic evolutionary
biology and conservation, our understanding of adaptive
potential is still quite lacking. Our lab is interested
in which types of genetic diversity are most important
for adaptive potential (e.g. within vs. between popula-
tion) and how best to quantitatively estimate adaptiveMay 1, 2020 EvolDir 67
potential within and among populations.
Our research group was founded 8 years ago and cur-
rently includes 1 postdoc and 6 graduate students. I
have also advised 5 former postdocs, and the publi-
cation records of Amir Yassin and Justin Lack show
what a productive environment our lab can be. I also
welcome postdocs taking important components of our
research with them when they found their own labs. Fur-

'PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING IN BIOLOGY'
Instructor: Nichole Bennett (The University of Texas
at Austin, USA) Dates: July 20th-24th, 2020 Location:
Crete, Greece
COURSE OVERVIEW: The eld of biological sciences
is becoming increasingly information-intensive and data-
rich. For example, the growing availability of DNA
sequence data or clinical measurements from humans
promises a better understanding of the important ques-
tions in biology. However, the complexity and high-
dimensionality of these biological data make it dicult
to pull out mechanisms from the data. Machine Learning
techniques promise to be useful tools for resolving such
questions in biology because they provide a mathemati-
cal framework to analyze complex and vast biological
data. In turn, the unique computational and mathemat-
ical challenges posed by biological data may ultimately
advance the eld of machine learning as well. This
course will cover basics of the Python programming lan-
guage as well as the pandas and sklearn Python libraries
for data wrangling and machine learning. The course
is intended to give participants a conceptual overview
of machine learning algorithms and an intuition for themathematics underlying them, equipping participants
to be able to choose and implement appropriate models
for biological datasets

COURSE OVERVIEW: Python is a user-friendly and
powerful programming language commonly used in scien-
tic computing, from simple scripting to large projects.
This workshop will provide hands-on practice in a bi-
ological context for beginners, with very limited prior
programming experience. This course is designed to
be very applied, and we will explore Python tools of
immediate help to the working scientist. After com-
pleting this course, participants will be able to apply
Python programming automation to their own research
problems and should be equipped to continue their own
Python learning. While this course will focus on data
analysis using Python, participants will gain language-
agnostic principles of programming, like automation
with loops and encapsulation with functions, that will
serve as best practices for their scientic computing.

tion of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural
variants (SVs) within the population, to the assessment
of their likely functional impact of the detected variants
in an evolutionary context.
Learning outcomes:
1) Identication of SNPs and SVs using de novo genome
assembly and read mapping strategies
2) Assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the dif-
ferent DNA sequencing technologies, Illumina, Pacic
Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, for the detection of varia-
tions
3) Strengths and pitfalls of de novo assembly and map-
ping approaches for comparative genomics
4) Hands on experience of state of the art methods to
compare multiple genomes
5) Annotation of variations and comparative genomics
analysis
6) Familiarity with biological sequence analysis in an
evolutionary context

Online MorphologicalPhylogenetics
Oct19-30
Dear colleagues,
Registration is open for Transmitting Science on-
line course: MORPHOLOGICAL PHYLOGENETICS:
PRINCIPLES, APPLICATIONS, AND TECHNIQUES
'V 2nd edition.
Dates: October 19th-30th, 2020
This course will be delivered ONLINE: 35 hours of on-
line live lessons. A good internet connection is required
to follow the course.
Max number of students: 18, slots will be allocated in
rst come, rst served basis.
Course Overview: An accurate reconstruction of evolu-
tionary relationships among species is the cornerstone ofMay 1, 2020 EvolDir 71
evolutionary biology. Building phylogenetic trees thus
provides the fundamental framework upon which system-
atic, biogeographic and evolutionary research operates.
Morphological phylogenetics provides a unique toolkit
for inferring relationships, considering that the vast ma-
jority of the species that have ever lived are now extinct
and can only be assessed based on morphological data.
Additionally, combining fossils and morphological data
with molecular data from extant species is becoming the
most comprehensive method of assessing phylogenetic
relationships on deep time and the time of origin of ma-
jor evolutionary lineages. In this course, we will focus
on the analysis of morphological data (and combining
morphological data with molecular data) using multiple
optimality criteria for phylogenetic inference. We will
discuss the best available approaches to construct mor-
phological data sets and their impact on phylogenies.
We will follow with theory and hands-on practice of
phylogenetic programs using maximum parsimony, max-
imum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Participants
will learn how to combine morphological and molecu-
lar data for total evidence analyses, how to conduct
time-calibrations using tip and node dating, dierent
birth-death models, morphological clocks and combined
evidence relaxed clock analyses. Softwares: Mesquite,
TNT, RAxML, IQTree, Mr. Bayes and BEAST.

ONLINE PopulationGenomics
May18-22
Dear all,
the 5th edition of the Population Genomics course
will be held online: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course9/ Instructors: Dr. Martin
Taylor and Dr. Lewis Spurgin (University of East Anglia,
UK)
The course will cover the basics of population genomicanalysis from SNP data onwards and will cover the key
analyses that may be required to successfully analyze
a population genetic data set. The course will NOT
cover steps prior to generation of a .vcf le or SNP
data set such as NGS data demultiplexing, clustering
and SNP calling (This is covered in detail in the Intro-
duction to RADseq course). This course will introduce
Linux and the command line environment, basic perl
and python usage, le conversions and manipulation,
population structure and dierentiation in R, outlier
analysis, landscape / seascape genomics and introgres-
sion. The course will use a range of software including
the Linux operating system and R.
This course is aimed at postgraduate students and early
career researchers who are interested in using population
genomic tools in their research. No previous experience
of bioinformatics is required, but an underpinning in
evolutionary biology and basic population genetics con-
cepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and FST are
desirable.
Having completed the course, students should have a
good understanding of the software and methods avail-
able for population genomic analysis and be competent
in population genomic analysis.

Videos for EvolutionaryBiology
In this new era of distant engagement, those who
tire of Power-Point may nd the \Academy" ap-
proach of Salman Kahn a refreshing change (http:/-
/www.khanacademy.org). Students see multicoloured
drawings, arrows, numbers and letters, moving across a
black background to Khan's melodious vocal accompani-
ment. With pause and rewind options, they can proceed
at their own pace. Each 15 minute video can act as a
basis for a subsequent Zoom discussion. The courses
have spread worldwide and volunteers have translated
them into many languages.
While lacking Kahn's high oratorical skills, I have done
my best to emulate his pen-tablet approach with a series

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but74 EvolDir May 1, 2020
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
