SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT Next generation se-
quencing and aquaculture - October 5, 2011 ˜A La
Rochelle.
Genomic approaches for aquatic species How can new
technologies help to improve breeding and sustainabil-
ity of farmed aquatic resources?
Context: Biotechnology evolves quickly oﬀering new
tools to researchers and producers to advance in the
knowledge of ﬁsh and molluscsˆ a genomics with appli-
cation in both ecology and production. AQUAGENET
is a cooperation project funded by INTERREG IVB
SUDOE program. Its main objective is to promote
the interaction between scientists and aquaculture sec-
tor in the SUDOE area to apply the new biotechnolo-
gies to the sector. This synergistic cooperation im-
plies a unique opportunity to join eﬀorts to improve
the competitiveness and development of aquaculture in
this area.
Topic of the workshop: The availability of genomic
tools applicable in aquaculture is still scarce. Next
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide the
means to rapidly increase the availability of such tools.
This workshop will form a unique opportunity to gather
producers and researchers from various ﬁelds around
the common theme of improving breeding and sustain-
ability of farmed aquatic species with NGS.Provisional program: Conﬁrmed keynote speakers :
Deborah Power (CCMAR, Faro, Portugal); Gregory
Maes (LeuwenUniversity, Belgium); Florian Humily
(Station Biologique de Roscoﬀ, France). One day work-
shop divided in four sessions, one dedicated to NGS
technologies followed by three sessions dedicated to
their use in ﬁsh, molluscs and their pathogens. Lan-
guage of the workshop will be English.

*2nd Call for Participants* * * *Workshop on the
Biogeography and Phylogeography of Atlantic Fishes*
Date: 26-27 November 2011 Location: Lisbon, Portu-
gal
Over the last several years a number of studies on the
phylogeography of Atlantic ﬁsh have started to shed
light on evolutionary processes in this taxa and in their
marine environment. Some reviews devoted to biogeo-
graphic patterns, namely diversity patterns, historical
refuges, dispersal routes and barriers, etc have been
published in recent years. The aim of the workshop is
to present a coordinated synthesis and discuss studies
and perspectives on major patterns and give updates
on the state of the art in Atlantic biogeography and
phylogeography of ﬁsh and outline directions for future
research.
The workshop will focus on a number of high proﬁle
keynote speakers and the aim is also to provide a fo-
rum in which early career students have an opportunity
to discuss their work through informal poster presenta-
tions.
The meeting will be held in a location where speak-
ers and attendants can spend quality time interacting
informally, taking advantage of breaks and meals to-
gether.

ference on Polyploidy, Hybridization, and Biodiversity
(ICPHB2012) which will take place from 7-10 May 2012
in Pr` uhonice near Prague, Czech Republic.
The International Conference on Polyploidy, Hybridiza-
tion and Biodiversity aims at promoting knowledge ex-
change and discussion of the latest developments con-
cerning these major drivers of genome shaping and
evolution. A wide range of topics will be covered
such as polyploid speciation and phylogeny; diversity
of reproductive modes and their impact on popula-
tion structure; analysis and modeling of population
structure; inﬂuences of polyploidy and hybridization

PhD opportunity - The impact of ﬁre on the endangered
Gouldian ﬁnch
A PhD project is available investigating the role of
ﬁre in determining the distribution, foraging ecology
and health of the endangered Gouldian ﬁnch (Ery-
thrura gouldiae). This project is a collaboration be-
tween the Department of Environment and Conserva-
tion (DEC), Save The Gouldian Fund (STGF) and Aus-
tralian National University (ANU). The student will
be based in the Research School of Biology at Aus-
tralian National University (Canberra) under the su-
pervision of Dr Sarah Pryke (ANU, STGF) and will be
co-supervised by Dr Ian Radford (DEC).
This is an exciting cross-disciplinary initiative that
combines ﬁre and plant ecology with conservation and
animal behaviour. The project will address a large
knowledge gap about how ﬁre aﬀects the distribution,
diversity and health of tropical Australian ﬁnches, andespecially the endangered Gouldian ﬁnch, in the east-
ern Kimberley of Western Australia. Although common
until relatively recently, the Gouldian ﬁnch is now one
of Australias most endangered birds. The reason for
this rapid decline remains untested at present, but it
is thought that frequent hot ﬁres severely reduce the
availability and diversity of perennial grass seeds (the
Gouldian ﬁnches diet), causing the ﬁnches to starve.
This project will experimentally test this idea by: (1)
investigating how birds are distributed in relation to
habitat quality (ﬁre histories); (2) testing the role that
ﬁre plays in the distribution, abundance and diversity
of perennial grass seeds; (3) evaluating the relative role
of ﬁre-sensitive food resources in determining breeding,
habitat use and dispersal decisions; and (4) determin-
ing the health and success of diﬀerent populations un-
der diﬀerent ﬁre regimes. This project has implications
for understanding how ﬁre aﬀects the behaviour, habi-
tat use and distribution of ﬁre-sensitive species, and
for generating large-scale ﬁre management strategies to
eﬀectively conserve and promote the endangered Goul-
dian ﬁnch.
Applicants should preferentially have a background in
ﬁre, landscape or plant ecology and relevant experi-October 1, 2011 EvolDir 9
ence working in remote ﬁeld sites. This project will be
largely ﬁeld-based in the eastern Kimberley of West-
ern Australia, with the student based at the Save The
Gouldian Fund Research Station in Wyndham.
The opportunity is only open to Australian and New
Zealand Citizens (permanent residents of Australia).
The candidate will need to obtain an Australian Post-
graduate Award (APA) scholarship at ANU, and thus
eligibility includes a Bachelors degree with First-class
Honours, or a research Masters degree from a recog-
nised university. APA scholarships include a stipend
and allowances for relocation and thesis costs, and addi-
tional funding will be provided through ANU and Save
The Gouldian Fund to cover ﬁeld expenses.
Interested students should email their CV (includ-
ing details of two academic referees), academic
record, and research interests to Dr Sarah Pryke
(sarah.pryke@mq.edu.au).

WeedPopulationGenetics
PhD position in evolutionary ecology of invasive wild
radish populations in Australia
The evolutionary basis of invasiveness in weeds is a
rapidly developing area of theoretical and empirical
research. This project will explore possible mech-
anisms that inﬂuence invasiveness using wild radish
(Raphanus raphanistrum) as a model system. You will
use a phylogeographic approach, incorporating both
chloroplast and SSR markers, to ascertain the coloni-
sation history of wild radish in Australia and relate
this to the evolution of invasiveness in this highly suc-
cessful weed. This study should increase our under-
standing of the ecological and evolutionary signiﬁcance
of several possible mechanisms that generate invasive-
ness including evolution of the breeding system and
intra- and inter-speciﬁc introgression. This 3 year stu-
dentship would be co-located at the University of Can-
berra and the the CSIRO Division of Plant Indus-
try. At CSIRO the student would work with Profes-
sor Andrew Young and Dr Jenny Pierson and at the
University of Canberra with Assistant Professor Paul

ETH Zurich HostParasite
The Institute of Integrative Biology at ETH Zurich -
Experimental Ecology Group - is oﬀering a PhD posi-
tion
“Alternative resistance systems in host-parasite inter-
actions”
The project is ﬂexible but a ﬁrst aim is to use current
methods (such as RAD sequencing) to identify appro-
priate markers for the study of host-parasite interac-
tions in the ﬁeld. Our study system involves Bombus
spp. on the host side and trypanosome infections. As
a background resource, the genomic toolbox for B. ter-
restris is currently reﬁned and will result in an anno-
tated genome. The project work will be based on sam-
pling and experiments in the ﬁeld and lab. We seek
to understand some principles that govern the dynam-
ics and adaptive processes in this model host-parasite
system. The anticipated project is part of an ERC
Advanced Grant on alternative host resistance systems
and the population structure of parasites (RESIST).
We look for candidates that are interested in challeng-
ing ecological and evolutionary questions and who are
willing to explore new methodical tools for this purpose.
A successful candidate may have some experience, for
example, in molecular or population genetics, the use
of gene data banks, or be familiar with the analysis of
adaptation. Whatever the background, a demonstrated
interest in evolutionary biology, population genetics, or
ecology is an asset. The project will be embedded in
an active research group with long-term experience of
the system.
Starting date is negotiable, but no later than spring
2012. Please send applications (CV, Publication list,

We are looking for two students, preferably biologists,
to start two grants for two PhDs in systems biology12 EvolDir October 1, 2011
and/or evo-devo about:
-Gene network simulations of pattern formation, mor-
phogenesis and morphological evolution of mammalian

Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them are
required.
The grants are provided through the Finnish academy

LMU Munich Hybridization
The Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) in Munich
is among the top one hundred universities in the world,
and part of the German Excellence Initiative. The De-
partment of Biology (Evolutionary Ecology) seeksA PhD students in Evolutionary Ecology
Project title: The role of hybridization in the coloniza-
tion of newly opened habitats
The PhD students will participate in a collaborative
research project of Justyna Wolinska to investigate hy-
bridization between species as a creative evolutionary
force that allows rapid adaptation to new environments.
This project is a part of a large research initiative
funded by the German Science Foundation: ˆ aNatural
Selection in Structured Populationsˆ a. The overarching
goal of this Research Unit is the study of natural selec-
tion in realistic population settings. Because of its role
as a driving force of adaptation, understanding natu-
ral selection is undoubtedly one of the most important
objectives of evolutionary biology.
Speciﬁcally, the student will study how hybrid-speciﬁc
traits may facilitate the colonization of novel habitats
(small quarry lakes), using the *Daphnia* hybrid com-
plex as a model system. *Daphnia* communities will be
screened at the microsatellite loci and three contrasting
scenarios of hybrid maintenance will be tested: survival
of hybrids as clonal lineages, recurrent hybridization
events or establishment of hybrids through migrants. In
addition, using laboratory experiments it will be tested
if hybrids have more diverse phenotypes compared to
parental taxa (due to increased genetic variation in hy-
brid individuals). Finally, the ﬁeld and laboratory data
will be used for parameterization of a mathematical
model, which will be developed to study the contri-
bution of diﬀerent ecological parameters to the success
of hybrids. The proposed combination of empirical and
theoretical approaches will advance our understanding
of the role of hybridization in the colonization of new
habitats and, more generally, of genetic exchange in
adaptive evolution.
The main methods are: microsatellites, experiments,
some mathematical modelling (in collaboration with
Joachim Hermisson, University of Vienna) and a little
bit of ﬁeld work.
We are looking for highly motivated candidates with
interests in the evolutionary ecology and population
genetics. The position will be for a period of three
years, and should start as soon as possible (December
2011 or soon thereafter). The students will take part in
the organized PhDprogram (including attending vari-
ous skills courses) of the university. The ideal candidate
should have a strong background in evolutionary biol-
ogy and/or population genetics. Good molecular skills,
excellent communication and writing skills in English,
good work ethics, and creative thinking are desired.
Skills in mathematical modelling will be advantageous.
A Diploma or Masters degree (or equivalent) in biologyOctober 1, 2011 EvolDir 13
is necessary for admission. The working language in
the group is English.
Applications should include 1) a letter of interest with
a description of pertinent experience, 2) curriculum vi-
tae, 3) abstract of the master/diploma thesis, 4) a list

now well recognized that evolutionary change can aﬀect
the interaction between species within in a few gener-
ations and that ecological interactions may inﬂuence
the outcome of evolution in return. This project uses
fast growing aquatic organisms (algae, viruses, rotifers)
that allow tracking of evolutionary change and ecolog-
ical dynamics in combination with subsequent analy-
sis through mathematical modeling. For details of the
study system refer to Becks et al. 2010 Ecology Let-
ters, Becks & Agrawal 2010 Nature, Ellner & Becks

We are looking for a highly motivated ecologist or evolu-
tionary biologist to join our newly formed group ?Com-munity dynamics? at the Max Planck institute for Evo-
lutionary Biology. The ideal candidate is fascinated by
evolutionary and ecological questions, independent and
creative. She/he has a background in evolutionary biol-
ogy, population or community ecology and has worked
with aquatic systems before. A MSc (or equivalent)
in Biology is required. For more information on the
project contact Lutz Becks (lbecks@evolbio.mpg.de).

MonashU 2 InvasionDynamics
Two PhD projects will be oﬀered from 2012 in the
Evolutionary & Invasion Biology research group at
Monash University, Melbourne, Australia ( http://-
www.biolsci.monash.edu.au/staﬀ/chapple/ ).
The two projects are part of a long-term research
project on the invasion dynamics of the delicate skink,
*Lampropholis delicata*. The delicate skink is na-
tive to eastern Australia, but has successfully invaded
several regions of the Paciﬁc (New Zealand, Hawai-
ian Islands, Lord Howe Island). Previous research in
the group has used molecular markers to identify the
source population(s) for each introduction, examined
post-introduction molecular and morphological evolu-
tion, and investigated the behavioural traits that en-
hance the likelihood of human-assisted dispersal.
Project 1: The role of behaviour and behavioural syn-
dromes in the invasion success of the delicate skink:
Recent research has indicated that particular be-havioural traits, or suites of correlated traits (be-
havioural syndromes), may enhance the success of in-
troduced species at particular stages of the invasion
process. The project will use a series of ﬁeld and
laboratory-based studies to investigate the role of be-
haviour in the success of the delicate skink as an inva-
sive species. The project will be co-supervised by Dr
Bob Wong (Monash University).
Project 2: Evolutionary ecology and climatic adapta-
tion of invasive delicate skink populations:
This project will involve a series of ﬁeld and laboratory-
based experiments to investigate climatic adaptation
in *Lampropholis* and the invasive populations of the
delicate skink. The study will examine populations
across both the native and introduced range. It will
also examine the behavioural interactions in the intro-
duced range among individuals from genetically diver-
gent source populations (i.e admixture). The project
will be co-supervised by Prof Mike Thompson (Univer-
sity of Sydney).
Interested students should email their CV (includ-
ing details of two academic referees), academic
record, and research interests to Dr David Chapple (
David.Chapple@monash.edu) by Monday 3rd October.
For each project, one applicant will be selected to com-
plete and submit an online PhD scholarship application
by the 31st October deadline (a mid-year scholarship
round [31stMay] may be available for highly-qualiﬁed
students who are unable to make the October dead-
line).
Students will need to successfully obtain a PhD
scholarship. Australian and New Zealand citizens
can apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award
(APA) or Monash Graduate Scholarship (MGS). In-
ternational students can apply for an IPRS or

NewZealand Insect Genomics
Two PhD positions, in the School of Biological Sciences
at the University of Auckland and funded by the Allan
Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution,
are available in insect genomics and genome evolution.
These positions will be based at Landcare Research
on the Tamaki campus of the University of Auckland.
Both students will be primarily supervised by Thomas
Buckley and co-supervised by Richard Newcomb and
Howard Ross, all of the Allan Wilson Centre and the
University of Auckland. The successful candidates will
have an interest and experience in bioinformatic anal-
ysis of genomic data and computational evolutionary
biology.
Project 1: Genome evolution, speciation and molecular
population genetics of giant weta
Giant weta (Insecta, Orthoptera) are the largest insects
on earth and some species are highly endangered. This
project involves genome sequencing a species of giant
weta using Illumina technology, followed by genome
assembly, annotation and comparative analysis. The
draft genome will be used as a template for downstream
transcriptome and RAD-tag studies of variation within
and among other giant weta species. The transcrip-
tome studies will target various phenotypic character-
istics such as reproductive and sensory processes. The
data will be used to examine processes of adaptation
within and among species. The conservation implica-
tions of these data will be an important aspect of the
research.
Project 2: Genome evolution, speciation and molecular
population genetics of stick insects
The common stick insect (Clitarchus hookeri) is
widespread through much of New Zealand. This
species is particularly interesting at it is a geographic
parthenogen and is closely related to other species, one
of which it has hybridized with. The successful can-
didate will perform Illumina sequencing and assemble
and annotate a draft genome of this stick insect species.
The draft genome will be used as a scaﬀold for further
RAD-tag studies of SNP variation within C. hookeri
and among closely related species. Transcriptome data
will also be collected and mapped to the draft genome
for study of various phenotypic traits and selection and
adaptation. Variation will be measured and compared
within and among populations of C. hookeri and withclosely related species.
Funding includes a $25,000 NZD per year scholarship
and $5,000 for tuition fees.

UMainz AntEvolution
PhD position in ant ecology
We invite applications for a PhD position in tropical
ant ecology at the University of Mainz, Germany. The
PhD candidate will study and compare the ecosystem
functions of ant communities in the tropical rainforests
of South America and Southeast Asia. He/she will use
standardized experiments to assess the performance of
diﬀerent ant species in a set of ecosystem functions that
are related to food consumption and the defense of food
resources.
The overall aims of the project are to assess functional
redundancy and niche diﬀerentiation of ant communi-
ties in tropical rainforests. The studies will take place
in primary and disturbed rainforests in French Guiana
and Malaysian Borneo, and the results will be compared
between habitats, but also between French Guiana and
Borneo to determine whether the functional niche dif-
ferentiation in ant communities evolved convergently on
the two continents.
The position requires a recent diploma or master degree
in biology or a related ﬁeld. The successful candidate
should be highly motivated and have experience with
ﬁeld experiments and entomology. A driving licence
is necessary; expertise in ant identiﬁcation and statis-
tics is advantageous. The project involves a four-month22 EvolDir October 1, 2011
stay each in French Guiana and Malaysian Borneo. The
position (65% TV-L E13) is funded by the DFG and
limited to three years.
Interested candidates should send applications as a
single e-mail attachment (pdf) containing a curricu-
lum vitae, a list of publications, a pdf of the Master
or Diploma thesis, a letter of motivation and the ad-
dresses of two potential referees to Dr. Florian Menzel,

UNeuchatel EvolutionTheory
1 phd position: Partner Control/ Game theory /Coop-

A 3 year phd position is available, for theoretical re-
search in a joint project of the Institute of Biology
at the University of Neuchˆ atel and the Department of
Ecology and Evolution of the University of Lausanne,
the latter providing the actual working location ( http:/-
/www.unil.ch/dee ). It is funded by a project of the
Swiss National Science Foundation aiming at investi-
gating the evolution of various partner control mecha-
nisms in the context of cooperative interactions.
The project will be supervised by Redouan Bshary (an
empirical biologist at Neuchˆ atel) and Laurent Lehmann
(a theoretical biologist at Lausanne) and aims at study-
ing a number of questions from a theoretical point of
view. How should an individual respond to a non-
cooperative partner? Should the partner be punished or
should one switch partner? How does partner switching
depend on the variation of the expressions of coopera-
tion in the population? Does it depend on the within-
group network of interactions? A key aspect of the
modeling will be that assumptions regarding popula-
tion structure and interaction patterns will be informed
by natural model systems such as vervet monkeys and
cleaner ﬁsh mutualism.
Applicants should have a master degree in a relevant
area (e.g. behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology,
economics with focus on game theory, physics, or math-
ematics), with strong mathematical and computing
skills, and a vivid interest in fundamental research.
Inquiries and applications should be sent to lau-
rent.lehmann@unil.ch or redouan.bshary@unine.ch.
Applications should be sent by November 1st, and
should include a CV, a one-page statement of research
interests, and names of 2-3 referees. Only applications
with all these information will be considered.

At the Department of Organism Biology. Starting date:
As agreed upon, preferably as soon as possible.
The overall aim of the project is to use comparative
genomics to study the eukaryote/prokaryote transition.
This will involve investigating the origin of eukaryote
speciﬁc traits, particularly the origin of the nuclear en-
velope and the nuclear-encoded components of the mi-
tochondrial proteome. The PhD projects will run in
parallel and will initially focus on assembling and an-
alyzing genome sequence data from microbial eukary-
otes and bacteria. The work will be conducted entirely26 EvolDir October 1, 2011

PhD Position in Theoretical Population Genetics at the
University of Vienna
The mathematics and biosciences group (MaBS, home-
page www.mabs.at ) led by Joachim Hermisson at the
University of Vienna is looking for a strong and highly
motivated candidate for a PhD position in evolutionary
modeling and statistical data analysis.
Project: Due to modern methods of high-throughput
sequencing, huge amounts of DNA sequence data from
population samples (“polymorphism data”) are avail-
able today. Interpretation of these data is an important
task for theoreticians. In the project, we will develop
novel methods to detect so-called footprints of selection
in DNA polymorphism data. These footprints can be
used to describe the pattern of recent adaptations on a
genome. We will particularly focus on eﬀects of poly-
genic selection on genetic footprints. We will use math-
ematical methods based on stochastic processes (coales-
cent theory) and extensive computer simulations. TheOctober 1, 2011 EvolDir 29
project is part of an international DFG-research group
“Natural Selection in Structured Populations” in col-
laboration with groups in Evolutionary Biology at the
University of Munich, and Mathematics at the Uni-
versity of Freiburg. This work will be conducted in
collaboration with Angela Hancock, a postdoctoral re-
searcher in the MaBS group. Research environment:
Vienna is not only one of the world’s most liveable
cities, but also oﬀers an excellent research environment
and is currently developing into one of the main centers
in evolutionary research in Europe. The position will
be located at the Max F. Perutz Laboratories, part of
the Vienna Biocenter Campus, which houses a vibrant
community of researchers from several institutes. As a
member of the MaBS group, the student will also inter-
act closely Magnus Nordborg and members of his group,
and will be part of a larger community of evolutionary
biologists and population geneticists through the activ-
ities of the Vienna Graduate School for Population Ge-
netics ( http://www.popgen-vienna.at ) and EvolVienna
(www.evolVienna.at).
Conditions: The position is for three years, salary is ac-
cording to the FWF standard rates for PhD students in
Austria. The starting date is ﬂexible (November 2011
or later, starting date before summer 2012 preferred).
Application: We are looking for a candidate with a
strong background in quantitative methods (analytical
or computational modeling or data analysis) and inter-
est in evolutionary research. Applicants should have a
Master / Diploma degree in natural science (e.g. biol-
ogy or physics), mathematics, or bioinformatics. Pro-
gramming skills are highly appreciated. The working
language in the group is English. German skills are not
essential. The reviewing process will start in mid Oc-
tober 2011 and will continue until the position is ﬁlled.
Applications should include a CV, letter of interest, and
the names and email addresses of two potential ref-
erees. Informal inquiries and applications (preferably
as a single pdf) should be sent to Joachim Hermisson
(joachim.hermisson[AT]univie.ac.at).

PhD position in plant ecology and evolution
A four year PhD position funded by the European Re-
search Council (ERC) is available from January 2012
at the Institute of Systematic Botany, University of
Z¨ urich, to study the evolution of ﬂoral signals. A fo-
cus of the project will be the trade-oﬀ between attrac-
tion of pollinators and defense against herbivores. The
behavioral impact of ﬂoral signals on pollinators and
herbivores and/or the molecular bases of ﬂoral volatile
production will be studied. In addition, evolutionary
models will be constructed to predict the evolutionary
responses of ﬂoral signals to diﬀerent biotic environ-
ments. The project is embedded in the larger context
of the ERC grant on ﬂoral signal evolution; thus, close
collaboration with other PhD students working on this
topic is expected. You should have a Master or equiv-
alent academic degree, a keen interest in evolutionary
biology, and a background in either molecular or organ-
ismal biology. Enthusiasm for experimental work with
plants and insects is required. The successful candidate
will work in a very well equipped institute and an excit-
ing research environment. The Institute of Systematic
Botany at the University of Z¨ urich consists of 3 profes-
sors and 6 academic staﬀ, as well as a large group of
PostDocs, PhDs, and Master students. The institute
is located in the pretty botanical gardens and houses
modern molecular and chemical ecology labs, including
greenhouses and climate chambers for plant cultivation.
The University of Z¨ urich has a very broad coverage of
organismal and molecular biology, and several research
groups work on evolutionary topics ( www.lifescience-
zurich.ch ). The city also oﬀers excellent quality of life
through cultural programs and infrastructure, as well
as an attractive surrounding (lake, alps).
If you are interested in the job, please send (preferen-
tially by e-mail) a letter describing your motivation,
C.V., copy of degrees, publications (or manuscripts, if
available), and e-mail addresses of two academic ref-
erees, by 15th of October 2011. If you have further
questions, don’t hesitate to contact me.

ABI 3130xl
Dear EvolDir
I am experiencing some problems with an ABI 3130xl
sequencer. When running a spectral calibration I get an
error code: failed spectral calibration, “no” candidate
spectral ﬁles found. I looked at the possible causes and
made changes but still I get the same error code. I am
suspecting this has something to do that the spatial cal-
ibration does not get saved. When I go into run history:
Spatial Calibration Viewer, none of my recent spatials
are saved there (although they passed). Anyone had a
similar experience?
Thankful for any help or suggestions!

AmerSocNaturalists survey
Dear Members,
The American Society of Naturalists (ASN) typically
holds a joint conference each year (the “Evolution Meet-
ing”) with the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE)
and Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB). Starting in
2014, we plan to begin biennial independent meetings ofthe American Society of Naturalists, to bring together
a broader spectrum of biologists, including ecologists
and animal behaviorists who might not typically attend
the Evolution meeting. The purpose of these meetings
will be to foster interdisciplinary interactions among
biologists who share ASN’s goals: “ to advance and to
diﬀuse knowledge of organic evolution and other broad
biological principles so as to enhance the conceptual
uniﬁcation of the biological sciences.”
To help us plan the best possible meeting, I am writing
to ask you to take just a couple of minutes to ﬁll out
a brief survey. This will help us evaluate the level of
interest in this meeting, choose the optimal time, and
gather ideas for themes and formats that might help
interdisciplinary conversations and communication be-
tween students, postdocs, and faculty at all levels.
The survey can be found at: http://-
www.surveymonkey.com/s/YNCHZ9V Please also
forward this message to any students or colleagues who
might be interested.

VOLUNTEER FIELD ASSISTANT OPPORTUNITY,
sexual selection and reproductive biology of Australian
birds.
We are looking for a volunteer ﬁeld assistant to help
with a study of the reproductive biology of passer-
ine birds in Australia from November 12 through to
mid/late-December. This is a great opportunity for
someone who wants to gain further ﬁeld experience in
preparation for a Masters or PhD program in evolu-
tion, ecology or behaviour. Work will be conducted at
multiple sites throughout Australia (New South Wales,
South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland),
thus the position will involve a large amount of travelingby air and car. Primary duties will include observation
and passive and target netting of birds, collection of
blood and other tissue samples and data entry. Vol-
unteers are also expected to help with driving (thus a
drivers license is required), maintenance of equipment
and general logistics (cooking, cleaning, etc). Previ-
ous experience mist netting and bleeding is preferred,
but highly motivated individuals lacking experience will
also be considered. Study sites are remote, ﬁtted with
only basic facilities and poisonous snakes, ticks and spi-
ders are common. Thus volunteers must be able to work
under harsh conditions V high temperatures, hiking oﬀ-
trail in a variety of habitats, etc V and live and work
with a small group (group size varies from 2 to a dozen)
throughout the period. Moreover, working days will be
long, often beginning at or before dawn and continuing
until dusk. Throughout the project there will be fan-
tastic wildlife viewing opportunities (kangaroos, walla-
bies, parrots, wombats, etc) and our ﬁnal site is in close
proximity to the Great Barrier Reef and the Queensland
rainforest. Food, housing and domestic travel will be
provided. However, assistants will have to provide their
own airfare to and from Australia (beginning in Syd-
ney). To apply, please send a cover letter detailing in-
terests and previous experience, your CV, and the con-
tact details of three references to Dr. Melissah Rowe
(email: melissah.rowe(at)nhm.uio.no: (at) replaces @

Coding BEAST discontinuous
partitions
Hello BEAST users
I need to create partitions that are composed of discon-
tinuous sequence and import it into BEAUTi to make
an .xml ﬁle for BEAST.
Example: charset chr1 = 3060-3709 6780-7084 7085-
7388 10321-10644; charset chr3 = 8831-9573; charset
unknown = 2043-2578 5441-5806; etc
BEAUTi appears to read only the ﬁrst segment. If
I separate with comas it can’t parse it. Does anyone
know whether BEAUti can read discontinuous parti-
tions and if yes, how to code it? Many thanks for sug-
gestions

Eden research funding opportunity
Dear Colleague:
Please note the upcoming deadline for research
exchange grants from the Evo-Devo-Eco Network
(EDEN) is October 31, 2011. EDEN is a program
funded by the National Science Foundation Research
Coordination ( http://edenrcn.com/ ).One of EDENs major goals is to enable graduate stu-
dents, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty to undertake
research exchanges in the ﬁeld of Evo-Devo-Eco, in or-
der to develop or share techniques, protocols and tools
for use with emerging model systems.
This fall EDEN will award ﬁve research exchanges to be
held in 2012. Each exchange will consist of an award of
up to $3,000 per researcher toward travel, lodging and
subsistence costs. Applicants must be based at a US
institution, may be of any nationality, and may apply
for an exchange anywhere in the world. You can ﬁnd
out more about this program at http://edenrcn.com/-
funding/index.html . If you know of outstanding lab
personnel who would be interested, please forward this
announcement to them.
If you have not done so already, please consider “join-
ing” EDEN by ﬁlling out a brief survey about your lab’s
areas of expertise. You can complete the survey on our
website at http://edenrcn.com/join/ or by clicking
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JoinEDEN This
survey will allow your lab to be added to a searchable
database of scientists, organisms and techniques that is
available on the EDEN website ( http://edenrcn.com/-

ESEB Symposia
InﬂuentialSymbionts
Dear Evoldir community.
We are organizing a symposium at the First Joint
Congress on Evolutionary Biology. This will be an
ESEB Symposia.
Our topic is Inﬂuential Symbionts: Master manipu-
lators of adaptive host behavior. While we can all
agree that dramatic examples of behavioral manipu-
lation such as ants infected by fungi or rats infected by
Toxoplasma are obviously hostile takeovers what is the
role of the unseen symbionts (mutualists, commensals
& parasites) on host behavior? We are interested in ex-
ploring everything from mobile DNA to the microbiome
and from parasites to mutualists. We expect that in the
coming years the way in which behavior is viewed will
change and increasing examples of it being a product
of two or more genomes will be surface. Since we ex-
pect that some of this research is currently nascent we
want to have a general call for our symposium. If you
are interested in attending please apply. Depending on
what comes up this could lead to an invited, 30 minute
presentation to you.
Please express your interest before the 30th September.

Speciﬁcally:
Hemiptera (both Homoptera and Heteroptera)
Tysanoptera (thrips) Psocoptera (bark lice) Phthi-
raptera (true lice) Any Polyneoptera (grasshoppers,
crickets, etc.)
There are limited publicly available data sets for these
taxa, so if anyone has an as yet unpublished data set
that they wouldn’t mind me taking a look at please e-
mail (rduncan@bio.miami.edu). Also, please feel free
to contact me with any questions you may have.

LizardEvolution
Field assistant for frillneck lizard study in the Kimber-
ley (WA)
An enthusiastic and capable volunteer ﬁeld assistant
is required for a research project on frillneck lizards
(Chlamydosaurus kingii) in Wyndham, Western Aus-
tralia. This project will form part of a PhD study in
tropical northern Australia on the evolution of colour
in the frill. Fieldwork will involve:
- locating and capturing lizards in order to ﬁt them
with radio- transmitters - taking morphometrics and
other ﬁtness indicators (e.g. bite force) - tracking radio-
collared lizards to determine territory size - conducting
behavioural focals on territorial males - assisting with
performance experiments on captive lizards at the ﬁeld
station
The ﬁeldwork requires spending 7-8 hrs per day (6 or
7 days/week) working in hot, humid conditions. The
study areas are located near a small town, where a ﬁeld
station with basic facilities is located
The position requires commitment to the full ﬁeld sea-
son, which will run from late October/early November
2011 until February 2012. Travel to and from the ﬁeld
site will be covered by the university, as will accommo-
dation for the duration of the ﬁeld season.
Ideally, applicants should have some ﬁeld experience,
good observational skills, be reliable, and also able to
work independently. Previous reptile handling experi-
ence would be preferable, but is not essential. This is
an excellent opportunity for recent science graduates to
gain valuable ﬁeld experience of in-depth behavioural
and evolutionary research.
Application deadline: 1st October 2011
For more information, and to apply, please contact
David Hamilton (davidghamilton@hotmail.com), PhD
candidate, Department of Brain, Behaviour and Evo-
lution, Macquarie University. Interested applicants
should e-mail a cover letter, CV and the contact in-

Microsatellite duplication
Dear evoldir members,
We are amplifying nuclear microsatellites in a diploid
plant species. We are working with eight loci. Seven of
them works normally, but one the loci shows a dupli-
cation of the ampliﬁed product. That is, we found two
groups of fragments of diﬀerents size that are ampli-
ﬁed simultaneous and with the same genotype proﬁle.
For instance, when a individual is homocigote for one
of these regions (e.j. genotype 119:119 bp) is homo-
cygote for the other (genotype: 151:151 bp), while a
heterocygote individual for one region (ej. 119:124) is
heterocygote for the other region (151:157). On the
other hand, we always found a higher intensity signal
in the bigger fragments region (150pb). Is this a du-
plication of the microsatellite sequence in the genome
of the species?, Could this proﬁle be a artefact of the
technique?. We have found this duplication with two
diﬀerent DNA sequencer (ABI3100 and ABI3730XL).
Thank in advance,

Microsatellite services answers
Dear All,
A few weeks ago I asked for suggestions/experiences
with companies that construct microsatellite libraries.
I have collated all the replies (thank you to everyone
who got in touch) and appended these below.
Many thanks again, Sophie (svdh@sun.ac.za)

You could try GIS in the US ( http://www.genetic-id-
services.com/library.htm ). They’ve done a couple oflibraries for us and we’ve always been happy with the
output.

Savannah River Ecology Lab does microsat li-
brary development: http://srel.edu/microsat/-
Microsat DNA Development.html I had them develop
primers for my thesis and got good results.

I have been developing msats for 6 species. I found
a company in France (lille) that promises 100 bioinfo-
matic loci! for approx $2500! They get their micros
by enrichment and and 545 sequencing. You only have
to send 1 ug of mixed DNA (8 or more specimens). I
have had no results yet, but at least what they promise
sound good and cheap. details:

SREL does really nice work at low expense. I used to
work as a tech there.
http://www.srel.edu/microsat/-
Microsat DNA Development.html —–
I’d suggest you don’t get a library at all.
It will be (much) cheaper, probably quicker and cer-
tainly better (more diﬀerent repeat types, more loci) to
get a modest amount of next-gen sequencing done.
I don’t know if he is still doing this, but Michael Gard-
ner<michael.gardner@ﬂinders.edu.au >has been orga-
nizing multiple people to share the same next-gen run,
and then putting the sequences through the relevant
software.
He has a recent paper (Mol Ecol Resources) explaining
it all.
Typical outcome for a vertebrate is several hundred
candidate loci (with primer design) for a few thousand
dollars.
My particular species was very tricky, and the outcomes
were better than multiple attempts at old fashioned li-
braries, even given we have a lot of experience with the
old way.
—–
We have had several microsatellite libraries constructed

Have you thought about skipping the library business
and doing a portion of a next gen sequencing run in-
stead? I’ve made several libraries but never would again
as it’s more expensive and takes a heap longer than a
next gen seq run. The trick is to ﬁnd others who are do-
ing it so you can all share part of a lane to save money.
I expect there are several folk who are organising such
things but I know for sure that Steve Donnellan at the
South Australian Museum (and Uni of Adelaide) is co-
ordinating this. I think the cost is somewhere in the
vicinity of A$2000. Good luck.

Microsat NGS answers
Dear all, here are the relevant answers I received con-
cerning my question on amplicon sequencing of mi-
crosats. The ﬁrst paper provides actual data on thenext-gen sequencing of microsats. Thank you for all
responses.
Koen
>Hello,
I dont have direct experience with this, but i have one
idea. You mention “how many X coverage do you need
to know the ’correct’ allele sizes”. This is going to be
related to how speciﬁc the pcr is, i.e. how much slip-
page goes on. Well if you run these microsats as ’true’
microsats on an abi3730 (or whatever) how much of a
stutter peak is there? if these almost no stutter then
youd expect the 454 results to give predominantly 2 al-
lele sizes. if theres a lot of stutter then not so much.
the other consideration is that if the alleles diﬀer in
size by one repeat length (eg alleles sizes 250/252 in a
dimer microsat then stutter of one allele can easily give
the second allele, but if they diﬀer in several repeats
(250/260 in a dimer) then this wont happen
Though with 454 it seems like getting microsat data is
not the most eﬀective use of your cash (what about
RAD tags? eg http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/-
info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000862 )!
thats my 2 cents :)

NESCent Hackathon member
Dear colleague–
Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenetics (HIP), a
NESCent working group [1], envisions a future virtual
phyloinformatics bazaar in which comparative data and
phylogenies are archived, shared, annotated, re- used,
aggregated, marked up, mashed up, and linked in. In
pursuit of this vision, the working group is staging a
series of hackathons (i.e., intensive participant-driven
hands-on development meetings) that empower early-
career scientists to help build and take advantage of
an emerging network of interoperable evolutionary re-
sources [1].
The HIP leadership team [2], which is responsible for
planning and implementing the hackathons, is seeking
an additional member to share in our vision. We are
particularly interested in a scientist with experience in
applying phylogenetic approaches in ecology (broadly
deﬁned), ideally with some kind of emphasis on data
integration, aggregation, or other kinds of data reuse.
Leadership team members need not be programmers,
but they must be interested in promoting the devel-
opment and application of software tools and interop-
erability standards, and they are expected to bring to
the table knowledge of software-related challenges (and
possibly resources) relevant to using phylogenies and
comparative data for ecological research questions.
HIP leadership team members are expected to at-
tend a face-to-face leadership meeting in December
2011 or January 2012, monthly teleconferences, and 3
hackathons over the next 2 years; they should allow
additional time to prepare for meetings and to follow
ongoing hackathon projects. Hackathons thrive on a
balanced mix of participant expertise and roles: lead-
ership team members will be part of the mix, but may
serve in roles other than software developer, such as
documentation coordinator, use-case researcher, code
tester, etc. (If you are interested only in being part ofOctober 1, 2011 EvolDir 73
a hackathon, watch for future calls for participation in
this venue).
Over the 2-year period of the project, the HIP lead-
ership team will steer the focus areas, participant
mix, and tangible products for the working group
hackathons. The team members can expect enjoyable,
rich, and productive interactions with a growing and en-
ergetic community of evolutionary scientists interested
in issues of interoperability, data sharing, standards,
and cyberinfrastructure. This is a unique opportunity
to make a contribution towards advancing the state-of-
the- art and the state-of-the-practice in interoperability
and evolutionary biology.
To apply, ﬁll out a short online application form at
http://bit.ly/qmqfXi by September 12th, 2011. We en-
courage you to resolve any questions you have about the
group’s mission, the hackathon model, or the speciﬁc
role you might play, by contacting one of the project’s
PIs listed below. The current Leadership Team [2]
will sort through the applications and reach a decision
within one week.
Feel free to re-send this message as needed. Thanks!

Noninvasive DNA extraction
Hi Everyone,
Can somebody please help me with the issue below.
I am new to DNA extraction from animal tissues (as
Ive only worked with plants), and Id like to wonder
what non-invasive sampling technique can be recom-
mended for small mammals (as wed like to work with a
highly endangered animal no liver, heart, etc. samples
are normally available)? What storage conditions can
be recommended before DNA extraction? Does 95%
ethanol provide good samples for ampliﬁcation of frag-
ments >1 kb? (In plants it does not.) The general
practise in plants to store plant tissue before extrac-tion in silica-gel, and it usually provides high quality
DNA. Does this work in animals? We would also like
to work with (old) museum preserved specimens and
skeletal samples found in owl pellets. Is there a good
method to extract DNA from these tissues where we
expect to have small quantities of fragmented DNA?
Thanks a lot!
Cheers to the community, Orsi

Original source of origin-ﬁxation
model
What is the original source of the origin-ﬁxation model?
Dear colleagues–
Evolutionary models based explicitly on origin-ﬁxation
dynamics – including the mutational landscape model
of adaptation, as well as a variety of other models from
population genetics and phylogenetics – treat evolution
as a series of events whose dynamics are characterized
by multiplying a rate of origin (e.g., 2Nu for diploids)
with a probability of ﬁxation (e.g., 1/2N for the neu-
tral case; 2s for beneﬁcial mutations), leading (in the
simplest case) to familiar formulas of k u for random
ﬁxation of neutral mutations, and k 4Nus for selective
ﬁxation of beneﬁcial mutations.
The origins of this model of evolution are not widely
known. Some recent authors attribute it to Gillespie,
Sella & Hirsh, or others. However, a generalized origin-
ﬁxation formalism is presented in Eqn 5 of Kimura &
Ohta, 1971 (JME 1:1-17). Interestingly, the beneﬁcial
version (Eqn 7) and the neutral version (Eqn 9) were
invoked earlier, in 1968 to 1971, in works (listed below)
by Kimura, Ohta, Maruyama, King, Jukes, Zuckerkandl
and Vogel.
Was the origin-ﬁxation model used prior to the molec-
ular revolution? We have not seen any deliberate anal-
ysis of the source of the origin-ﬁxation model, though a
reading of Crow (1987) suggests that it originated with
Kimura.
If you know of an earlier source for this formalism, we
would appreciate hearing about it. Of course, formulas
for the probability of ﬁxation date back to the work of
Fisher, Haldane and Wright in the 1920s and 30s, but
writing down the ﬁxation probability of a new mutant
is not the same as modeling evolution as a series of74 EvolDir October 1, 2011
ﬁxation events. Our interest is speciﬁcally in whether
a theoretical model of origin-ﬁxation dynamics was in-
voked prior to the period of 1968 to 1971.

Plant microEvoDevo funding
microMORPH (Molecular and Organismal Research in
Plant History) training grants Deadline: November 1,
2011 Award amount: up to $3,500
microMORPH is announcing a funding opportunity for
graduate students, post-docs, and early career faculty.
Each award is up to $3,500 and is available to indi-
viduals with an interest in microevolutionary aspects
of plant evo-devo. In particular, we wish to encour-
age visits from evolutionary ecologists, systematists and
morphologists to visit molecular developmental labs
with the intention of developing tools to investigate
clade-level diversiﬁcations V and visits from members
of molecular developmental labs interested in learning
of the biology and evolutionary ecology of non-model
groups of species. The interdisciplinary nature of these
focused interactions will provide a unique opportunityfor participants to integrate historically disparate ﬁelds
and in turn develop research programs at the interfaces
of evolutionary ecology, organismic biology, and devel-
opmental biology.
Please see our website ( http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/-
microMORPH/ ) for a list of past awardees and details
on how to apply.
These training grants are supported by a ﬁve-year grant
from the National Science Foundation entitled micro-
MORPH: microevolutionary Molecular and Organismic
Research in Plant History. This grant is funded through
the Research Coordination Network Program at NSF.
The overarching goal of the microMORPH RCN is to
study speciation and the diversiﬁcation of plants by
linking genes through development to morphology, and
ultimately to adaptation and ﬁtness, within the dy-
namic context of natural populations and closely re-
lated species.
In addition to awarding travel and training grants, the
microMORPH RCN also hosts web pages for graduate
students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty working
on plant microevolutionary developmental biology from
a paleobotanical, organismic, morphological, or molec-
ular perspective or any combination thereof. If you do
not already have a microMORPH web page and would
like us to host one for you, please contact us and we
will set one up for you (no computer work is necessary
from your end). Please visit our web page for exam-
ples: http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/microMORPH/

Software Transformer-4 T4
Dear EvolDir members:
I am contacting you to introduce Transformer-4 (T4),
a free multi-platform computer software programmed
in Java to boost the analysis of any genotype matrix in
PC, Mac or Linux.
T4 is suitable for codominant and dominant genotype
matrices containing an unlimited number of alleles perlocus, loci, individuals, populations, or taxa (diploid
individuals, in the case of codominant data).
Any number of genotype matrices resident in T4’s ma-
trix explorer is liable to be transformed easily, swiftly
and simultaneously into the input formats of one or
several of the 38 most commonly used population ge-
netic software (and for any possible combination of the
populations that each matrix contains).
T4 also allows the users to quickly publish peer-
reviewed “genetic diversity digests” in the Demiurge
information system. Such “digests” are made up by
a geo-referenced T4 genotype matrix plus any ancil-
lary information relevant to its interpretation that the
authors see ﬁt to include (see an example digest click-
ing here <http://www.demiurge-project.org/images/-
digest show.png >).
To use T4, just register in the Demiurge information
system by clicking on
http://demiurge-project.org/register , and ﬁll in at
least the mandatory ﬁelds. Registration is a free, fast
and easy process.
After accepting Demiurge’s terms of use through the
validation email that the system will send you, users
can download T4 and all its converters (or any subset
thereof) respectively from:
http://www.demiurge-project.org/download t4http:/-
/www.demiurge-project.org/converterstore Four ex-
amples of Excel matrices suitable to be imported to
T4 are available in the T4 download page.
Downloading and installing converters in T4 is an ex-
tremely fast and easy process, which is described in
Chapter 4 of the user’s manual provided within the ap-
plication (under the “Help” button).
Two papers about the information system Demiurge
and the software Transformer-4 will soon be submitted
to the journal Bioinformatics.
A list with the most important features oﬀered by T4
and Demiurge is given below.
On behalf of the Demiurge development team <http://-
www.demiurge-project.org/contact >, we hope you en-
joy T4 and Demiurge
Juli Caujap´ e-Castells Jardin Botanico Canario “Viera
y Clavijo”-Unidad Asociada CSIC (Cabildo de Gran
Canaria)
The key features oﬀered by T4 and the Demiurge in-
formation system are the following:
1. T4 and all its converters are free, and suitable for
Mac, PC and Linux operative systems. 2. The T4 for-76 EvolDir October 1, 2011
mat provides a standard for genotype matrices. 3. T4 is
customizable, as users may choose which software con-
verters to install. 4. T4 is interactive, as independent
programmers may submit new converters that comply
with T4’s API through Demiurge’s Converter store. 5.
T4 includes a “Thesaurus wizard” web service for the
validation of the taxonomic names in the matrices prior
to initiating the publication of a genetic diversity di-
gest. 6. The publication of digests in Demiurge can
only be initiated from the T4 software, with the advan-
tages that: (i) Demiurge aﬀords a fast, free and easy
way to store standardized T4 genotype matrices, and
manage or re-analyze them, thereby avoiding the risk
of their being lost or corrupted in the users’ comput-
ers; (ii) Demiurge immediately assigns a unique digest
code upon submission that does not change after the
review process, and may therefore be cited in scientiﬁc
communications or papers; and (iii) Demiurge allows all
registered users to access other matrices hosted by this
information system, which are ready for download and
fast meta-analysis through the above-described capabil-
ities of T4. 7. Demiurge automatically hyperlinks all
taxa in the digests with available meta-data about them
in GBIF, GenBank, JSTOR, and The Encyclopedia of
Life. 8. Upon digest acceptation, all authors receive an
e-certiﬁcate of digest authorship and integrity, and the
reviewers receive an e-certiﬁcate of acknowledgement.
9. After digest publication, the corresponding authors
may use their access data to Demiurge to manage most
items in the digests on behalf of all authors (except
for the .tfm4 genotype matrix), correct eventual errors,
and add or remove optional ancillary information. 10.
Data in published digests can only be downloaded by
registered users, who have accepted Demiurge’s terms
of use. 11. All the data and meta-data in Demiurge
are safely and permanently stored at the supercomput-
ing facilities of the Instituto Tecnol´ ogico de Canarias
(Gobierno de Canarias), and are curated by members
of this institution. To

SSE September Update
Greetings,
Here’s an update on the latest from the Society for
the Study of Evolution. I hope you made it to the
annual meeting in Norman, Oklahoma. If you didn’t,
we’re meeting in Ottawa next summer (July 6-10, 2012)
with several societies, including the European Society
for Evolutionary Biology, the American Society of Nat-
uralists, the Society of Systematic Biologists and the
Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution. Infor-
mation about Evolution 2012 Ottawa will be coming
soon at this link: www.confersense.ca/Evolution2012/-
index.htm . REMEMBER to update your passport!
And, in 2013, we’ve decided to confab among the moun-
tains at Snowbird, Utah.
Our Council meeting in Norman conﬁrmed that the
Society is in excellent ﬁnancial shape, enabling us to
double the number of student travel awards over theOctober 1, 2011 EvolDir 77
previous year (20 to 40). We’ve passed a motion for
subsidized childcare for the next meeting and are work-
ing on a new mentoring program. Since our goal is not
simply to accumulate endowment funds, over the next
few years we will continue to fund new projects and in-
crease funding of old ones, especially for student travel
and research.
A few other items of interest: the SSE is now provid-
ing ﬁnancial support for the National Center for Sci-
ence Education, a critically important organization for
ﬁghting creationism in America, and our Education and
Outreach Committee continues to fund teacher work-
shops as well as sponsoring a symposium at the annual
meetings.
We also have a slate of candidates for this fall’s elec-
tions, and you’ll be asked to vote soon. Do remember
that you can nominate candidates for the various of-
ﬁces by responding to the call for nominations early
each calendar year.
Like the Society, our journal Evolution is thriv-
ing as well. You can read Editor-in-Chief
Daphne Fairbairn’s journal update here ( http://-
www.evolutionsociety.org/zNews20110902-journal.asp )
Five other matters for your attention: 1) The Bi-
ological Sciences Directorate at NSF is implement-
ing new submission and proposal review procedures.
As this will aﬀect many of you, please read the
recent “Dear Colleague” letter (dated August 15)
from Dr. Joann Roskoski, Assistant Director (Act-
ing) www.evolutionsociety.org/news.asp#nsf11815 2)
Announcing the NSF and USAID Partnerships for
Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) http:/-
/www.nsf.gov/news/news summ.jsp?cntn id=121003
3) Membership renewals will start on October 1st. Why
October 1st? Eﬃciency is the answer, particularly if
you are ordering a print copy of EVOLUTION. Get-
ting the subscription numbers right before producing
the new volume allows us to be as eﬃcient and timely
as possible in working with our printers and distribu-
tion services. During the renewal process, you will have
the opportunity to support the Society through gifts to
our important awards and Society funds.
Please take the time to renew your membership when
the notice comes out.
4) The American Society of Naturalists (ASN) is solic-
iting a brief survey about future biennial and indepen-
dent meetings of the ASN, although they will continue
to meet with the SSE/SSB. To read about this concept,
and ﬁll out a brief survey to help the ASN plan these
meetings, go here ( http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/-YNCHZ9V ).
5. Are you interested in supporting improved Sci-
ence Literacy? In 2010, SSE became a partner in
the PlantingScience program. This is a 14 Society
coalition mentoring middle and high school students
online. We’re looking for members to volunteer 3-5
hours, over a four to six week period, to be online
mentors. Learn more about the program at http://-
www.PlantingScience.org/ . To become a part of the
program click the scientist tab and then, Volunteer as
a Scientist Mentor.

Wolf parental care reference
Dear Evoldir community,
I am looking for a (probably old) reference regarding
the evolution of male parental care in wolves. The
story that i vaguely remember is that mothers produce
so many pups that they are rendered unable to forage,
and so the male is forced to forage. Any similar docu-
mented case for any species would be welcome.
Thank you in advance, Doug Yu

ComputationalGenomics
The Computational Genomics Group in the John
Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National
University (Canberra, Australia) have made pioneering
contributions to our understanding of genetic diversity
within and between mammal species in areas including:
the genomic distribution of linkage disequilibrium, hu-
man molecular adaptation, the inﬂuence of sex on mu-
tation rates, the relationship between epigenetic state
and genetic variation, and the radiation of mammals.
These contributions have been accompanied by signif-
icant methodology developments in the form of both
novel statistical models and open source software foranalyses of genomic diversity. Our recent advances in
models of context-dependent substitution, for instance,
represent a signiﬁcant advance in robust estimation of
the mode of natural selection.
We are seeking outstanding applicants for a postdoc-
toral fellowship. The individual will work on the devel-
opment and application of improved models of sequence
divergence, joining a highly productive collaboration
between Associate Professors Gavin Huttley and Von
Bing Yap (Department of Statistics and Applied Proba-
bility, National University of Singapore). The work will
build on the PyCogent open source software toolkit for
statistical modelling of molecular evolution developed
in the Huttley lab.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher
position at the Centro de Ciencias do Mar (CC-
MAR), University of the Algarve (CCMAR - http://-
www.ccmar.ualg.pt/ ) in the research group of Cymon J.
Cox (Plant Systematics and Bioinformatics). The suc-
cessful applicant will participate in the project titled “A
phylogenetic study of charophyte and land plant chloro-
plast evolution using data- and time-heterogeneous sub-
stitution models” funded by the Portuguese Foundation
for Science and Technology (FCT).
Project overview: The evolutionary transition of plants
from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment marks the
initiation of terrestrial ecosystems and is one of the
most important events in Earth history. It is widely
accepted that the modern diversity of land plants (em-
bryophytes) originated from a single evolutionary event
and that they arose from ancestors of the freshwater
charophyte algae. However, phylogenetic relationships
among the groups of charophytes and among the major
groups of land plants (bryophytes and tracheophytes)
are controversial. This phylogenetic uncertainty spans
the evolutionary land-transition boundary making it
diﬃcult to polarise the key developmental innovations
underpinning land colonisation. In this project we will
apply innovative phylogenetic analyses to chloroplast
genomic data to resolve these relationships, and supply
the necessary conceptual framework to determine the
evolutionary trajectory of morphological traits during
the colonisation of land.
The project includes the assembly and annotation
of chloroplast genomes from next-generation sequence
data, and will provide the successful candidate with
an opportunity to study bioinformatic techniques and
phylogenomic analysis.
Candidates must have a strong background in phyloge-
netic and systematic theory and practice, and prefer-
ably a knowledge of green algal and bryophyte sys-
tematics. Familiarity with the manipulation of next-
generation sequence data and a programming language
such as Perl or Python would be an advantage, though
not a strict requirement. An extensive publicationrecord will also be advantageous.
The position is available immediately and until the end
of December 2013 (after an initial 1 year probation),
and is open to all nationalities. The researcher will re-
ceive a salary of 1495 euros/month in accordance with
the grant component amounts of the Portuguese Foun-
dation for Science and Technology.
Applications should be submitted before Wednes-
day 14th September 2011 to Cymon J. Cox (cy-
mon@ualg.pt). Applicants should send a covering letter
detailing their research interests, a current C.V., and
the email addresses of 3 professional referees. Informal
enquires are welcome to the same address.

professional development and academic networking op-
portunities. Details about the program are available
athttp://sitemaker.umich.edu/um-postdocs . Most im-
portantly, we view these postdoctoral fellowships as
providing an exceptional opportunity to recruit poten-
tial new faculty to the University by oﬀering them a
combined postdoc and tenure track faculty appoint-
ment.
The University seeks applicants whose research, teach-
ing and service will contribute to diversity and equal
opportunity in higher education. Each applicant will
need to specify a faculty mentor at the University of
Michigan; this faculty mentor must be contacted in ad-
vance of application and express a willingness to mentor
the applicant if she or he is selected. Faculty are encour-
aged to identify emerging scholars they would be inter-
ested in sponsoring for this fellowship program and as
potential faculty colleagues, and directly inform them
about this opportunity. It is also possible to plan for
a potential candidate to do a postdoc in one academic
department, but to take up a tenure-track position in
another; in that case, both departments should be iden-
tiﬁed in the application process. Please note that the
President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program will pro-
vide funds for salary, beneﬁts and research. Up to nine
post-doctoral positions will be available annually; par-
ticularly outstanding candidates may be considered si-
multaneously (or subsequently) for tenure-track faculty

H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies for the pur-
pose of promoting academic and creative excellence in
the humanities, the arts, the social, physical, and life
sciences, and in the professions. In 2007, the Mellon
Foundation awarded a grant to add four Mellon Fellows
annually in the humanities, expanding the number of
fellowships awarded each year from four to eight. The
objective of the Society is to provide ﬁnancial and in-
tellectual support for individuals holding advanced de-
grees in their ﬁelds, who are selected for their outstand-
ing achievement, professional promise, and interdisci-
plinary interests. We invite applications from qualiﬁed
candidates for three-year fellowships at the University
of Michigan.
Candidates should be near the beginning of their pro-
fessional careers. Those selected for fellowships must
have received the Ph.D. degree or comparable artis-
tic or professional degree between June 1, 2009, and

Professors in appropriate departments and as Postdoc-
toral Scholars in the Michigan Society of Fellows. They
are expected to be in residence in Ann Arbor during
the academic years of the fellowship, to teach for the
equivalent of one academic year, to participate in the
informal intellectual life of the Society, and to devote
time to their independent research or artistic projects.
This is not an artist-in-residence program but rather
an opportunity to develop one’s work in conversation
with fellows from a range of disciplines during the three
years of the fellowship. Applications from degree candi-
dates and recipients of the Ph.D. or comparable artistic
or professional degree from the University of Michigan
will not b e considered.

UPMC Paris MicrobialEvolution
We are oﬀering a position for a 18 months postdoctoral
fellowship in Paris (France, Pierre and Marie Curie Uni-
versity) in evolutionary bioinformatics to study the evo-
lution of pathogenicity in microbial and viral genomes,
starting before June 2012. This position particularly
concerns recently graduated candidates, for a ﬁrst post-
doctoral experience. The postdoctoral fellow will work
with Eric Bapteste and Philippe Lopez, and 3 PhD stu-
dents, all specialized in the study of microbial evolution
by network- and forest-based methods.
More precisely, his/her research will focus on the the
detection of candidate genes involved in the emergence
and evolution of pathogenic agents, by identifying new
gene families of bacterial and viral pathogenecity with
bioinformatic network- and forest-based approaches.
This research will exploit the hypothesis that some gene
families involved in pathogenicity show a comparable
molecular evolution, genomic distribution, and topolog-
ical structure in gene networks and forest of gene trees.
Therefore, if new sequences (e.g. from the environment
or from genome projects) and new genes and gene fam-
ilies show comparable topologies, molecular evolution,
and genomic distribution with respect to gene families
already known to be involved in pathogenicity, these
new sequences may correspond to candidate genes of
pathogenicity.
Forest and network reconstructions and the analysis of
topological properties in these graphs are already mas-
tered in the lab. Based on our pre-existing methods, the
postdoctoral fellow will further develop computational
and statistical tools (i) to automate the detection of
candidate genes of pathogenicity in massive molecular
datasets, (ii) to detect what environments and genomes
may constitute reservoirs of genes of pathogenicity, and
(iii) to identify and classify novel environmental vari-
ants of known genes of pathogenicity. In silico methods
developped during this postdoctoral training should be
generic, to be readily applied to the search and analy-
ses of other types of genes (e.g. involved in parasitism,October 1, 2011 EvolDir 95
symbiosis, etc.) in massive datasets, to provide the
evolutionary community with fast and eﬃcient tools to
better understand the dynamic and evolution of micro-
bial genomes.
The postdoctoral fellowship will earn a monthly salary
of at least 2, 100 euros, and beneﬁt from an additional
2, 250 euros to attend national and international con-
ferences. He/she will have numerous opportunities to
collaborate with (i) graph theorists and statisticians
(Michel Habib, Fran¸ cois-Joseph Lapointe), (ii) micro-
bial evolutionary biologists (James McInerney, Christo-
pher Lane, Tal Dagan, Yan Boucher, William Martin)
and (iii) philosophers of biology (Richard Burian, Mau-
reen O’Malley, Fr´ ed´ eric Bouchard), regularly visiting
our parisian lab.

Jon Slate, Terry Burke and Tim Birkhead.96 EvolDir October 1, 2011
Postdoctoral Position.
We are looking for somebody with a track record of
publishing in leading journals and skills in one or more
of the following areas: evolutionary quantitative genet-
ics, next-generation sequencing-based genomics, QTL
mapping, genomewide association studies. The post-
doc will lead the analyses on a project that seeks to
identify the genes responsible for heritable variation in
sperm morphology and motility in the zebra ﬁnch (see
Mossman et al. 2009 63:2730-2737). In this project
we will construct and use a 10K Illumina SNP chip to
map QTL for sperm traits in a pedigreed captive pop-
ulation of zebra ﬁnches, where it is known the focal
traits are highly heritable. Results will be validated
by typing a wild population. In addition, Illumina Hi-
Seq sequencing will be carried out on cDNA obtained
from testes of males in selection lines for long and short
sperm. Genotyping and sequencing will be outsourced,
and so the bulk of the work will involve data analy-
sis. This project builds on zebra ﬁnch genomics work

Agroecological annotation of gene function and net-
work characterization in Brassica rapa. One post-
doctoral position in Evolutionary Genetics is available
to study in the lab of Cynthia Weinig at the University
of Wyoming. The position is associated with a ﬁve-year
multi-investigator NSF project that includes collabora-
tors from Dartmouth College, Kansas State University,
and University of California-Davis. The overarching
aims of this project are to 1) annotate shade-avoidance
genes using diverse genotypes and agroecologically rel-
evant conditions in order to understand variability in
yield, and 2) elucidate the shade-avoidance network
via computational methods that predict plant archi-100 EvolDir October 1, 2011
tecture from complex genotypes and that are applica-
ble to other traits. These objectives are highly com-
plementary in that phenotypic and environmental data
collected to annotate gene function can be used with
genetic regulatory information as inputs to develop sys-
tems biology models of shade avoidance.
Preference will be given to candidates with a strong
background in evolutionary genetics, particularly quan-
titative genetics, and candidates with either molecu-
lar genetic or modeling experience. The position oﬀers
opportunities to learn new measurement and analyt-
ical techniques in alternative disciplines through col-
laboration with other labs. Activities of the diﬀer-
ent labs will include function-value trait characteriza-
tion, quantitative-genetic analysis and QTL mapping
in RILs and natural accessions of B. rapa, ﬁne-scale
mapping and transgenic rescue to clone QTL, RNAseq
in lab and ﬁeld settings, and development and dissem-
ination of B. rapa genetic resources for enhancing K12
and undergraduate education. In addition, the posi-
tion requires data analysis, publication of manuscripts
and participation in workshops on career development.
Applicants should send a Curriculum Vitae, a brief let-
ter stating speciﬁc research interests, research accom-
plishments, and future research objectives as well as
the names and contact information for three profes-
sional references as a single pdf ﬁle to Cynthia Weinig
(cweinig@uwyo.edu). A Ph.D. is required by the time
the successful applicants start a position. Review of ap-
plications will begin Nov. 1 and continue until suitable
candidates are identiﬁed. The start date is negotiable
and salary will be competitive with full beneﬁts.

sity of Rochester)
http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Front Page
Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
and play an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecological communities. The development
of statistical methods for inferring phylogenies and for
making inferences from phylogenies continues to be an
extremely active and exciting research area.
In March 2012, for the thirteenth consecutive year, we
will oﬀer a workshop for graduate students interested
in applying phylogenetic methods to explore diverse bi-
ological problems. The one-week course is an intensive
exploration of the most current statistical approaches
in phylogenetic biology. The course starts with re-
cent advances in phylogeny estimation, and then fo-
cuses on methods for making various phylogeny-based
inferences.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Lab on
the Northern California coast, which has extensive com-
puting resources and on-site housing. The course for-
mat will involve equal parts of lecture, discussion, and
hands-on software training. One afternoon during the
week will be left free for ﬁeld trips to local natural areas.
Topics Covered
* Estimating, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees
* Recent advances in Bayesian and Maximum-
likelihood estimation of phylogeny
* Estimation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree
conﬂicts
* Divergence-time estimation from sequence data: re-
laxed clocks, fossil calibration
* Analysis of character evolution: maximum likelihood
and Bayesian approaches, ancestral-state estimation,
character correlation, rates of trait evolution
* Analysis of morphological form, function of complex
character systems
* Inference of diversiﬁcation rates: detecting rate shifts,
testing key innovation hypotheses
* Model speciﬁcation issues: model selection, adequacy
and uncertainty* Diagnosing MCMC performance
Course Registration. Complete details of the ap-
plication process will be announced in mid-October.

Dear all,
The SYNTHESYS2 JRA4 project is organising an open
seminar on DNA extraction from herbarium specimens
in London on 21st October. We would like to advertise
this more broadly to include anyone in the vicinity at
the time. The seminar is aimed for disseminating the
results from the JRA4 project which focuses on optimis-
ing DNA extraction from old herbarium samples. The
seminar is free and open to anybody, and is directed
to people who are using or planning to use herbarium
specimens in molecular studies. We hope to provide
answers, solutions and ideas for maximising the use of
herbarium collections in research & provide opportuni-
ties for the community to discuss future work.

Abstract: Taxonomy is one of the oldest branches of
biology and in a time of major loss of biodiversity of
critical importance today. But the subject currently
faces great threats and as well as great opportunities
- many tasks that traditionally required taxonomic ex-106 EvolDir October 1, 2011
pertise can now be performed by non-specialists using
modern molecular techniques, and the users of taxon-
omy expect information to be made available seamlessly
over the web. In the lecture I’ll explore some of the ma-
jor challenges facing the subject, drawing on the recent
NERC-sponsored report “Developing a National Strat-
egy in Taxonomy & Systematics”. I shall argue that
the future of taxonomy and systematics is assured, as
long as the subject takes the lead in redeﬁning itself as
a modern information science.

5th ConGen- Population Genetics Data Analysis
Course: Recent Approaches for Estimation of Popu-
lation Size, Structure, Gene-ﬂow, Selection Detection
focusing on conservation and beyond
27-Sep/1-Oct 2011, Flathead Lake Biological Station,
Montana, USA
Due to last minute quits two places become available
to attendend this edition
Objective: To provide training in conceptual and prac-
tical aspects of data analysis for the conservation ge-
netics of natural and managed populations. Empha-
sis will be on interpretation of output from recent
novel statistical approaches and software programs.
The course also will allow daily discussions among
young researchers and top-researchers to help develop
the next generation of conservation geneticists, and to
identify developments needed to improve data analy-
sis approaches. This course will cover analysis meth-
ods including the coalescent, Bayesian, approximate
Bayesian, and likelihood-based approaches.
Who should apply: Ph.D. students, post-docs, and pop-
ulation biologists with a background of at least one
semester university-level course in population genetics
and a course in population ecology. Applicants must
have a basic background in population genetic data
analysis, including testing for Hardy-Weinberg propor-
tions and gametic disequilibrium. Participation will belimited to 25 people allowing eﬃcient instruction with
hands-on computer exercises during the course. Pri-
ority will be given to persons with their own data to
analyze (for example graduate students at the end of
their degree program).
Deadline for application is 20 September, 2011
Course/Workshop Format: For each subject, we pro-
vide 30-45 minutes of background, theory, discussion
and introduction to concepts. Immediately following,
we will conduct data analyses together for 30-60 min-
utes using relevant software programs and real data
sets. Evening hands-on computer sessions and hous-
ing together of instructors and students in the same
location will allow for extensive exchange and facilitate
learning.

DiseasePhylogenetics Oct10-14
Workshop on Phylogenetics for Infectious Diseases -
with a focus on DNA viruses (October 10 - 14, 2011)
The aim of this workshop is to discuss how to im-
prove the analysis of evolutionary and epidemiological
aspects of viruses (mainly focusing on their genomic
sequences) and the infections they cause, using mathe-
matical tools. The main focus will be on DNA viruses
(e.g. varicella zoster virus, human papillomaviruses,
adenoviruses, etc.) though RNA viruses, such as in-
ﬂuenza and HIV are also included. The invited speak-
ers/participants are an inter-disciplinary mixture of
specialists in virology, epidemiology and mathematical
modelling (phylogenetics/statistics). By the end of the
workshop, the participants should have a better under-
standing of alternative and possibly newer mathemati-
cal approaches to analyse such viral gene sequence data.
Venue: Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS) of
the National University of Singapore

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
