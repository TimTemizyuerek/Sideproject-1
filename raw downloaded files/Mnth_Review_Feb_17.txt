SMBE 2017 Symposium \Systems approaches to behav-
ior"
We welcome abstract submissions for a symposium on
\Systems approaches to behavior" at SMBE 2017 in
Austin, TX. The symposium will feature talks by Lau-
ren O'Connell (Harvard University) and Hans Hofmann
(UT Austin). The deadline for abstract submissions is
February 1: http://www.smbe2017.org/ If you have
any questions, please feel free to contact Julia Saltz
(julia.b.saltz@rice.edu)
Symposium summary: Understanding the diversity of
animal behaviors and how this diversity evolves is an
intricate challenge because behavior uniquely combines
inputs across biological scales-from genes, transcripts,
and proteins interacting at tissue, organ, and whole
organismal levels to environmental factors such as other
individuals via social interactions. The goal of our sym-
posium is to bring together researchers working at the
interface of multiple levels of behavioral and molecular
analysis to highlight how systems-level approaches can
lead to new insights about behavioral evolution. Our
symposium will be timely because high-dimensional \-
omics" data, representing functional information at mul-
tiple biological scales, is rapidly becoming available; but
the evolutionary relevance of such information, particu-
larly for highly-plastic phenotypes like behavior, remains
unclear. Our symposium will contribute to building an
integrated conceptual framework for thinking about the
causes of variation in behavior at a systems level and
how such systems can evolve. Our invited speakers
will provide \worked examples" illustrating how dier-
ent molecular levels, neurobiology, and ecology can be
integrated to understand why behavior varies within
individuals, among individuals, and among species.

SMBE 2017 Symposium \Convergent evolution"
We are pleased to announce a symposium on \Conver-
gent evolution" at SMBE 2017 in Austin, Texas, this
July. Our invited speakers are Jay Storz (University of
Nebraska-Lincoln), Matthew Hahn (Indiana University),
and Sarah Kocher (Princeton University). Abstract sub-
missions for contributed talks and posters are welcome
and due on 1 February 2017. Please use the follow-
ing link for submission: http://www.smbe2017.org/-

prior to registration for the conference.
Symposium description:
*** Convergent evolution, wherein species independently
evolve substantially similar phenotypes in response to
similar selective pressures, is a potentially powerful crite-
rion to identify genotypes underlying adaptive evolution.
The on-going boom in comparative genomics has re-
newed interest in the molecular and genetic basis of
convergent phenotypes. Recent progress in the eld
has demonstrated the extent of convergence in a wide
variety of contexts, from microbes to vertebrates, and
resulting from conditions including environmental shifts,
sensory systems, and biochemical challenges. In addi-
tion, whole-population sequencing and in vitro evolution
has provided evidence of the dependence of convergence
on the nature of the selective pressure. At a higher level,
the study of convergence is outlining the constraints on
adaptive evolution and deepening our understanding
of natural selection. In light of the increasing amount
of genomic data available, the eld will benet from a
discussion of the challenges in robustly identifying and
testing apparent cases of convergence, with one major
challenge being distinguishing adaptive convergence at
the sequence level from chance events. This symposium
will present a balanced program of historical evolution,
in vitro evolution, methodology and theory in convergent
evolution. Talks will span the full spectrum of potential
convergence ranging across molecules, networks, and
phenotypes. ***

July. Our invited speakers are Isabel Mendizabal (Geor-

stract submission is possible prior to registration for the

Symposium description:
*** The quote from Dhobzhansky (\Nothing makes sense
in biology except in the light of evolution") is overused.
But there may be no current area of biology to which
this quote is more pertinent than epigenetics. In many
respects, the study of epigenetics has been a sterling
success. Geneticists and molecular biologists have un-
raveled some of the intricacies of epigenetic pathways
and the interplay of epigenetics with development. And
yet, without the tools and context of evolutionary bi-
ology, it is dicult to put these ndings into a proper
context. Evolutionary comparisons provide a lter to
help determine what phenomena are conserved, general,
and important over time. In this symposium, we seek
to integrate epigenetic information into an evolution-
ary framework, including the eects of epigenetics on
development, phenotype, and genome evolution. ***

Symposium Description |{
Cells are the basic units of life. Decades of researchin molecular-, cell-, and systems-biology have accumu-
lated impressive insights into the molecular mechanisms
of life, but the biodiversity of cellular systems remain
vastly under-explored despite its critical role in evolu-
tion. Building on successful models of well-known cells
in controlled environments, this symposium aims to
bring together cell biologists, systems biologists, evolu-
tionary biologists, and others interested in advancing
models of evolution at the cellular level. This focus on
cellular systems celebrates the latest advances in the re-
lentless Evolutionary Synthesis that started with Fisher
1918, and has been continuing whenever evolutionary
biologists study complex biological systems to achieve
an integrative understanding of evolution. Topics of
interest include, but are not be limited to:
- Mechanistic simulations predicting distributions of
mutational eects on cellular growth or survival - Mech-
anisms for establishing, maintaining, and modifying
cellular pathways, gene-regulatory sub-networks and ge-
netic subsystems - Mechanisms for evolving novel cell
types - Methods that help study the above
We will discuss how to integrate recent advances in
genome biology, computational molecular systems biol-
ogy, cell biology and evolutionary biology.

the symposium below:6 EvolDir February 1, 2017
The complex dynamics of host-parasite coevolution have
infrequently been described as changes in gene, protein,
or cell function. But as more researchers delve into
diverse host and parasite systems, armed with techno-
logical advances and focused on molecular evolution,
it is an opportune time to discuss novel ndings and
compare denitions and questions. This symposium will
foster dialogue among ecologists, geneticists, molecular
biologists, and immunologists, all united by an inter-
est in the mechanisms that underlie natural host and
parasite evolution. Although presentations will cover a
wide range of taxa and approaches, speakers will also
address unifying concepts, including: Which questions
and approaches are likely to scale across many systems,
and which are relevant to only subset of taxa? How
can molecular data be used to revamp models of host-
parasite interactions (or to design new ones), and what
previous theoretical predictions demand mechanistic at-
tention? What are the big dierences between studying
two-species versus multi-species interactions? How is
the molecular or cellular biology of immunity dierent
in wild populations (as opposed to lab settings), and
how can we best study immunology in the wild? And -
nally, what advances in other elds of biology should be
incorporated into host-parasite studies, and vice versa?

SMBE 2017 Symposium \Integrating Ancient and Mod-

We are pleased to announce a symposium on \Inte-

Shapiro (UC Santa Cruz) and Stephan Schiels (Max
Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena,Germany). Abstract submissions for contributed talks

ence.
Symposium description:
***
The study of contemporary whole genomes has greatly
improved our understanding of the evolution of pop-
ulations, but the availability of ancient genomic data
should give us a much more detailed comprehension of
the evolutionary process. However, the integration of
ancient and modern DNA into a coherent inferential
framework is challenging notably due to heterogeneous
sampling times and locations, dierences in coverage,
and post-mortem DNA damages. We also lack appropri-
ate theoretical models linking these two types of samples,
as one for instance often ignores the diusion of genes in
both space and time and assumes that old and modern
samples belong to the same population. The proper inte-
gration of old and contemporary samples is essential to
e.g. better distinguish genetic drift from selection, follow
specic adaptive processes over time, uncover ancestral
relationships among populations, distinguish between
alternate modes of selection, follow changes in gene ow
over time, or probe past population movements. In this
symposium, we aim at bringing together empiricists and
theoreticians presenting either novel methodological ad-
vances or new genomic datasets including a mixture of
ancient and modern samples or experimental/natural
time series to tackle fundamental problems in evolution.

SymbiosesAndInteractions Jul2-6
SMBE 2017 Symposium \Symbiosis and Interactions"
We are accepting abstracts for our symposium on \Sym-
biosis and Interactions" at SMBE 2017 in Austin, Texas,
from July 2-6. The symposium features invited speakers
Daniel Sloan (Colorado State University) and Teresa
Pawlowska (Cornell University). Abstract submissions
for contributed talks and posters are due Wed Feb 1
(http://www.smbe2017.org/abstracts/).
Symposium summary: Symbiotic interactions between
independent organisms play a critical role in providing
new ecological niches and promoting biological diversi-
cation. Over evolutionary time, hosts and symbionts
often enter a permanent co-evolutionary relationship,
where proper maintenance and regulation of symbiosis
is required for both lineages to survive. Although bene-
cial, symbiotic partners are also faced with challenges.
Symbionts experience rapid evolution due to high levels
of genetic drift and potential selection for selsh traits
and hosts must evolve to compensate for these factors in
order to maintain functional symbiosis. Thus symbioses
may be more similar to a coevolutionary arms race rather
than a static optimum. Our understanding of coevolu-
tionary interactions largely focuses on organelles (i.e. mi-
tochondria and plastid) and intracellular endosymbionts
present within host cells. Examining the role of genetic
variation and functional constraints on the evolution
of interacting genomes will shed light on how obligate
interactions between co-evolving genomes can promote
reproductive isolation, thus promoting biological diver-
sication. This symposium highlights work examining
coevolutionary interactions involving organelles and en-
dosymbionts and how these interactions may impact
the evolutionary trajectory of these lineages. This sym-
posium provides a central opportunity for integrating
the advancements in both endosymbiont and organelle
evolution as well as symbiosis.

previous theoretical predictions demand mechanistic at-
tention? What are the big dierences between studying
two-species versus multi-species interactions? How is
the molecular or cellular biology of immunity dierent
in wild populations (as opposed to lab settings), and
how can we best study immunology in the wild? And -
nally, what advances in other elds of biology should be
incorporated into host-parasite studies, and vice versa?

Apr3-5
NGS'17: Structural Variation and Population Genomics,
3-5 April 2017, Barcelona, Spain
Hosted by the International Society for Computational
Biology (ISCB) and the Centre for Genomic Regula-
tion (CRG), the Next-generation sequencing conference
covers a broad range of topics in genome sequencing
and analysis. Our particular focus areas in 2017 are
structural variation and population genomics.
New sequencing technologies have opened up the pos-
sibility to sequence genomes at a previously unprece-
dented scale. The sequencing of whole genomes from
large number of individuals representing multiple pop-
ulations allows the extent of genetic diversity, of both
at the single nucleotide level, and of larger structural
variants, to be catalogued. Using such data the genetic
basis of evolutionary and disease processes can be ex-
plored. The meeting will draw together researchers from
diverse backgrounds who develop and apply novel tools
to sequencing data. Topics covered will include, but are
not limited to, genome assembly, variant characteriza-
tion and analysis, gene expression, population history,
disease, and more!
The conference program will be a combination of keynote
talks from renown scientists with research focusing on
structural variation and population genomics, a selection
of thought-provoking submitted abstract talks, technol-
ogy and applications talks, as well as posters.

\ Wildre Ecology and Life Evolution: From Ancient

description
[T11-01] Wildre Ecology and Life Evolution: From
Ancient Time to Present
Wildres have been a signicant evolutionary factor
shaping the ecology of ora from ancient time to the
present. This symposium synthesise research from on
how has shaping ecology and evolution of terrestrial
ecosystems from ancient time to the present, and how
current knowledge can be translated into better re
management. \ Wildres are common and widespread
in the modern world, with about 60% of the Earth's land
surface being burnt over a 15-year period. The fossils
provide strong evidence in support of hypotheses of great
antiquity for re. Charcoals as evidence of presence of
ancient wildre rst appeared from the late Silurian,
410 Ma. However, ecologists and paleo-botanists have
long believed that climate and soils controlled the dis-
tribution of ecosystems, the role of wildre was largely
overlooked. The strong focus on the negative impact of
wildres on life and property has historically hindered
our understanding of re ecology. Only very recently,
evidence become emerging that wildre played an im-
portant role throughout the history of life on the Earth.
Wildre inuences on global ecosystem patterns and pro-
cesses, and has had a pronounced eect on the evolution
of biotas, and distribution of ecosystem.
In view of the limited fossil evidence for re being a
signicant ecological and evolutionary factor, a major
breakthrough in determining the origin of re-related
lineages has occurred over the last seven years. There is
accumulating molecular evidence that re-adapted lin-
eages go back many tens of millions of years. These dates
have been largely reconciled with fossil evidence. Hu-
mans and our ancestors are the only re-making species.
As we have expanded their use of re, our actions have
come to dominate some ecosystems and change natural
processes in ways that threaten the sustainability of
some landscapes. Moreover, the interaction between
res and climate change add to the future uncertainty.
We need to learn more about how wildre interacts with
a multitude of ecosystem processes. Particularly, we
need better data on past and current human inuences
on re regimes, and a greater understanding of dier-
ent cultural traditions of landscape burning and their
positive and negative social, economic and ecological
eects.
This symposium intends to bring together ecologists,
public educator, practitioners and policy-makers who
have common interest on wildre, synthesise researchFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 9

Dear Evoldir,
I think this symposium will be of interest to some of
you (and registration is free!)
*** Information transmission in small RNA pathways:
Mechanisms and consequences ***
When: Friday 10 March 2017 Where: Royal Society of
Edinburgh, George Street, EdinburghRegistration: https://small-rna-
pathways.eventbrite.co.uk This one-day symposium
aims to stimulate discussion between researchers
working on dierent aspects of small-RNA biology. This
includes both molecular biologists and evolutionary
biologists interested in small-RNA mechanisms in
disease and life-history contexts.
The theme of \information transmission" has been cho-
sen to include the transmission of information through
the pathways themselves (interaction or coevolution be-
tween small RNAs and their targets, target recognition),
transmission in space by small-RNA transport (between
tissues or between hosts and parasites), or transmis-
sion of information in time, either within-individuals
('memory') or between individuals (mother to ospring).

We are excited to invite you to submit abstracts and at-
tend our ESEB2017 symposium [S5] on \*Evolutionary
Biology of Ageing: integrating function and mecha-
nism*".
The symposium will take place at the 16th Congress of
the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB),

www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-abstracts/ SYMPOSIUM DE-
SCRIPTION: Ageing is an almost ubiquitous feature of
living organisms but its evolution and mechanistic basis
are still poorly understood. The rapid advances in our
understanding of the molecular biology of ageing pose
new challenges for our understanding of ageing evolu-
tion, and have created an urgent need for the integration
of recent empirical insights with an evolutionary frame-
work of senescence and lifespan. Thus the ambition of
this symposium is to address the integration of function
and mechanism in our understanding of the process and
evolution of senescence, both from an empirical and a
theoretical point of view. In addition, we aim for a
perspectives paper by the organizers together with the
speakers. Questions of interest include: Does the evo-
lution of ageing depend on the mechanisms mediating
senescence and death, and if so - how? Is the trade-o
between reproduction and survival indispensable for our
understanding of the biology of ageing? How important14 EvolDir February 1, 2017
are condition-dependent and true extrinsic mortality
rates for the evolution of ageing? How and why do de-
velopmental processes and growth aect the evolution of
senescence? What do state-dependent (i.e. sex-specic
or caste-specic) ageing patterns tell us about ageing in
general?

Dear Colleagues,
We encourage you to submit abstracts and attend our
ESEB2017 symposium [S28] on \Intragenomic conicts
and cytonuclear incompatibilities as engines of specia-
tion"

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: This symposium is
the result of merging two former independent proposals,
\Intragenomic conicts and speciation" and \The impact
of mitonuclear incompatibilities on animal speciation".
Conicts between genetic elements within an individual
for transmission into the next generation are increasinglyrecognized as powerful drivers of evolutionary change.
A by-product of the conicts and their dierential res-
olution can be negative epistatic interactions causing
reduced tness of hybrids and thus paving the way to
speciation. Multiple genes involved in postzygotic repro-
ductive isolation between recently diverged species have
experienced bouts of adaptive evolution which cannot
be easily linked to ecological selection, but which could
result from intragenomic conict (IC) and selection for
its resolution. Also phenotypes of interspecic crosses
experiencing asymmetric hybrid breakdown can often
be linked to ICs. A major unresolved question is the
relative role of ecologically based selection and selec-
tion due to ICs in the early stages of speciation. In
this symposium we would like to bring together diverse
experimental, comparative and theoretical perspectives
on the subject.
Many dierent and essential molecular factories within
the cell combine units contributed both by nuclear and
organelle genomes. Notwithstanding the functional con-
straints that operate on those complexes, the indepen-
dent control of the replication of those genomes antici-
pates challenging scenarios for the interplay of genetic
conicts, compensatory changes and molecular drive.
Mitochondrial and plastid genome variation in natural
populations have been traditionally considered as essen-
tially neutral, and accordingly used during the last three
decades to reconstruct the history of genetic lineages
in a huge number of animal and plant species. Direct
evidence of cytonuclear incompatibilities in wild popula-
tions is relatively common in plants, but denitely not
in animals, which could be particularly hard to analyze
in this respect. If mitonuclear incompatibilities in wild
animal populations were nally unveiled, it would be
necessary to revise the main conclusions of hundreds of
papers dealing with phylogeographic patterns in animal
species, published in the last 30 years, and the general
role of the coevolution of nuclear and organelle genomes
in speciation.

SCRIPTION: Horizontal gene transfer (genetic ex-
change) plays a key role in microbial evolution. New
insights into mechanisms and consequences of gene ex-
change, such as the contribution of phage-encoded genes
to bacterial adaptation in the gut and CRISPR systems
for bacterial immunity, are fundamentally changing our
understanding of how the genetic variation that fuels
evolution is created. Moreover, genetic exchange is cen-
tral to the evolutionary biology of infectious disease. For
example, antibiotic resistance alleles and virulence fac-
tors are often encoded on mobile elements such as plas-
mids. This symposium aims to bridge the gap between
research on the basic evolutionary biology of genetic
exchange and consequences for understanding the evolu-
tion and epidemiology of infectious diseases. We think
this will make an exciting ESEB symposium because ge-
netic exchange is a highly active eld among theoretical
and experimental evolutionary biologists, and its role
in pathogen evolution is a clear example of how evolu-
tionary biology can inform public health and medicine.
The invited speakers are at the forefront of research on
horizontal gene transfer, its role in evolution in general
and in key contexts like antibiotic resistance. To mini-
mize implicit bias in reviewing submitted abstracts we
will use a blinding procedure.

Abstract submission deadline: **Next Tuesday Jan 10**
Dear All,
We would like to invite abstract submissions for our
upcoming symposium on the Genomics of Adaptation
that will take place as part of the 16th Congress of the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB). The
conference will take place from August 20th - August
25th, 2017 in Groningen, the Netherlands.
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Genomics of Adapta-
tion [S16] Model organisms for life-history research are
mainly studied in the lab where functional genetics is
assessable. In general, however, knowledge about their
eco-evolutionary dynamics, such as biotic interactions,
is rare. By contrast, in organisms for which the ecology
and adaptation strategies in the eld are well known,
we typically lack the appropriate genetic tools to investi-
gate functionality. Advances in genomics and statistics
as well as investments in evolutionary model organisms
are now providing access to putatively adaptive genome-
wide variation within species from across the tree of life.
In this symposium, we focus on integrating life-history
biology, genetics and evolutionary ecology in the ge-
nomics era. We wish to (1) highlight the role of genetic
architecture of complex traits, such as adaptations to
biotic interactions or life-history traits; (2) contrast this
to morphological traits which are generally thought to
have a less complex genetic architecture; and (3) dis-
cuss the opportunities and drawbacks of specic model
systems.

Dear Colleagues,
We are excited to invite you to submit abstracts for
ORAL and POSTER presentations and attend our
ESEB2017 symposium [S12] on \Environmental eects
on sexual selection".
http://www.eseb2017.nl/sub/s12-environmental-eects-

Congress of the European Society for Evolutionary
Biology (ESEB), in Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25

www.eseb2017.nl/call-for-abstracts/ SYMPOSIUM
DESCRIPTION [S12] Environmental eects on sexual
selection
Sexual selection plays an important role in the evolution
of novel traits and can both enhance and delay the rate
of adaptation to changing environments. As for all other
traits, the evolution of sexual traits depends on three
factors: variation in trait expression, heritability of this
variation, and the association of traits with reproductive
output. However, specically in the case of sexual se-
lection environmental variation and selection pressures
(mate choice and competition) can interact to shape
the evolutionary dynamics of secondary sexual traits. It
is currently widely debated how environmental change
will aect sexual selection and, inversely, what the roleof sexual selection is in adaptation to a new environ-
ment In a time of major environmental change, these
questions are particularly important. We encourage
submission of a diversity of studies (descriptive, experi-
mental, theoretical) that address the inuence of spatial
or temporal variation of environmental conditions on
the expression of sexual traits, their heritability, or their
selective advantage. We aim to cover a wide range of
methodological approaches, systems and modalities to
facilitate a lively exchange about how to study and
understand the magnitude of environmental eects on
sexual selection.

Lund SexHermaphrodites Mar9-10
RegistrationOpen
Dear all,
We are happy to announce that 2017 SHOW meeting
will be held in Lund, Sweden during 9 - 10th of March!
The meeting will take place in the Ecology building
(S olvegatan 37) which is located northeast of the city
centre. It takes between 10-15 minutes to get there by
bus from the centre, or 30 minutes by walking. The
preliminary schedule for the meeting is:
Wednesday, 8th March: Informal meet-up at restaurant
Inferno in downtown Lund Thursday, 9th March: 9-12:
talks 13-16: talks 16-17: poster presentations Evening:
conference dinner at restaurant Hardings in Marieholm
(town located close to Lund) Friday, 10th March: 9-12:
talks 13-15: workshop/group discussion 16: meeting
closes18 EvolDir February 1, 2017
As usual, we will reserve the last session on Friday for
discussion/workshop and we are grateful for suggestions
and ideas for discussion topics, and thoughts on what
the meeting should focus on.
The dinner venue is Hardings in Marieholm, a small
town in the countryside, less than 20 minutes train
ride from Lund. Since this involves additional travel
expense (approximately 100 SEK return fee), we
have decided to make the dinner optional. Thus, the
registration fee without the conference dinner will
be slightly less expensive (300 SEK) than with (450
SEK). Alcohol with dinner is purchased separately
by cash or card - Hardings sells wine, cocktails,
locally brewed beer, and has a decent selection of
whiskey and rum. Tickets to and from Marieholm
can easily be purchased at the time of travel or in
advance through the Sk ~A ¥netraken app (Android:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=-
se.fskab.android.reseplaneraren&hl=en, iPhone:
https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/skanetraken/-
id310917083?l=en&mt=8).
Travelling to Lund by airport is very convenient, since
Kastrup airport (in Copenhagen, Denmark) is just
across the bridge. Trains from Kastrup airport to Swe-
den depart every 20 minutes and takes around 40-50
minutes to Lund.
There are several places to stay in Lund, and most of
them are located in the city center, like for example these
two hotels: http://www.concordia.se/en.aspx https:/-
/www.elite.se/en/hotels/lund/hotel-bishops-arms and
this hostel: http://www.winstruphostel.se/. Another
option would be to stay closer to the Ecology building
where the meeting is held, at Hotel Ideon: https://-
www.elite.se/en/hotels/lund/hotel-ideon/. Please make
your own reservation at your preferred hotel/hostel.
If you like to attend, please reply with the information
in the registration form below. The deadline registration
is February The small registration fee (450 SEK with
conference dinner, 300 SEK without) can be paid in
cash on arrival or by bank transfer to Jessica Abbott,
and will cover food and drinks during the meeting.

OldSpecimensNewTechnology
Dear colleagues,
We welcome contributed talks in our symposium \Mor-
phological Lazarisation: when new technology brings life
to historical specimens" at the International Congress
on Invertebrate Morphology in Moscow this August,
18th-23rd. Museum specimens remain an invaluable
part of our work and are often of stunning quality, even
in comparison with more recently obtained material. We
want to celebrate this, and the development of modern
techniques which help us bring these specimens back to
new life.
We realise that there may be certain political and per-
sonal concerns associated with attending this year's
conference, and we want to reassure you that we under-
stand these concerns. Your support of science without
borders is very important to us and the International
Society for Invertebrate Morphology, to our host com-
mittee in Moscow and to the wider community, so we
hope that you will join us this summer to celebrate
research with our colleagues in Russia. Registration and
abstract submission are now open! Please do register
when possible - there are just two weeks left before the
early bird deadline.
All presenting authors can submit one oral and one
poster abstract. Please do encourage others in your labs
and networks to submit content for the symposium -
we would be delighted to have other researchers, at any
career stage, join us.
A quick breakdown of the various upcoming deadlines:
www.icim4.com 1st February = Early bird registration
deadline. Early bird registration is 250 EUR, increasing
to 280 EUR. Note that to request an invitation letter
for your visa application, you will need to complete the
necessary boxes in the registration form (marked 'for
visa support').
31st March = Manuscript deadline for publication in In-

Dear Colleagues,
The Natural History Museum (London, UK) together
with the Malacological Society of London is hosting
a symposium, \Molluscan Colour and Vision" to be
held on the 27th of April 2017 at the Natural History
Museum.
The phylum Mollusca is highly speciose and is the largest
phylum in the marine realm. Many species are brightly
coloured and patterned and yet nearly all molluscs are
thought to be colour blind. Despite their limitations
with colour vision, molluscs showcase a myriad of dier-
ent eye types, many of which are unique in the animal
kingdom. In this symposium speakers will cover a range
of topics that highlight the extraordinary nature of
colour and vision in molluscs.

SensoryDrive Jun23-27
The American Society of Naturalists is seeking 5-minute
lightning talks for a Spotlight Session at the Evolu-
tion2017 meetings dedicated to the topic of ?25 Years
of Sensory Drive?. In 1992, the American Naturalist
published a supplemental issue on the topic of 'Sensory
Drive' organized by John Endler.? This issue featured
a number of inuential papers that emphasized the
role of the environment, phylogenetic history, and de-
velopment on the evolution and functioning of sensory
systems. This supplement introduced many ecologists
and evolutionary biologists to the intriguing and well-
developed topic of sensory ecology.? In this spotlight
session, we will consider the role of sensory drive as a
guiding framework in ecological and evolutionary stud-
ies of communication systems over the past 25 years,
and the extent to which it serves as a useful framework
going forward.
The format of Spotlight Sessions is the following: 1 15-
minute talk 3 5-minute lightning talks 1 15-minute talk
3 5-minute lightning talks 1 15-minute talk
Conrmed Speakers include Molly Cummings (Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin) and Leo Fleishman (Union
College). People who give 5-minute lightning talks may
also give a 15-minute talk in a regular session. We
seek speakers from a diversity of institutions and career
stages (including graduate students).
Those interested in participating should e-mail Becky
Fuller (fuller@life.uiuc.edu) by February 1, 2017.

Spotlight Symposium - Evolution Portland 2017
Conference: Portland.SSE MaleComp&Speciation.Jun23-
27
Sexual selection via male competition and the process
of speciationFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 23
I am organizing a special Spotlight Symposium for this
year's Evolution meeting in Portland, focused on the
role of male competition in speciation. The meeting
takes place June 23-27, 2017 in Portland Oregon.
The role of sexual selection in speciation remains con-
troversial, despite the last two decades of intensive work.
The importance of male competition has been almost en-
tirely ignored, as nearly all the work focuses exclusively
on how female preferences generate sexual selection in
ways that hinder gene ow. This is despite that ecolog-
ical competition over resources plays a central role in
speciation via natural selection, and that male competi-
tion can generate very strong selection. However, recent
work suggests that incorporating both male competition
and female choice into research on speciation can help
resolve the controversy over whether and when sexual
selection causes speciation, prevents it, or has no real
eect. Male competition sometimes complements and
other times opposes female choice, which can either ac-
celerate or put a brake on the speciation process, or lead
to asymmetries in gene ow. Another complexity is that
males compete both before and after copulation through
sperm competition or the analogous pollen competition
in plants; including this component can draw interesting
parallels between animal and plant speciation.
I invite submissions for 5 minute 'Lightning Talks' that
present perspectives from behavior, ecology, and evolu-
tion in an explicitly evolutionary framework with direct
connections to speciation research.
Here's the low-down on Spotlight Sessions from the
meeting organizers:
\Spotlight Sessions are more focused than a typical ses-
sion and have a dierent format. First, the talks are
solicited in advance. Second, each of the six Spotlight
Sessions will consist of 3 standard 15-minute talks inter-
spersed with sets of lightning (5-min) talks. We chose
this format by the logic that having several high-prole
researchers "anchoring\ a session on a specic topic
with a 15-minute talk will make it more valuable for
relatively junior researchers to give a 5-minute talk in a
focused session with the right target audience and other
relevant and well-known speakers rather than giving a
15-minute talk in a regular session."
Being part of this symposium can highlight your work
in this up-and-coming eld in context with others inter-
ested in similar topics. You get to help pave the way
for this new type of symposium at an awesome meeting
in the fun city of Portland. Unfortunately, the society
cannot compensate your expenses for participating in
this symposium.
Please contact me at boughman@msu.edu before Jan-uary 31, 2017 to indicate your interest in the symposium
and send an abstract. Also feel free to contact me if
you have questions. I will let you know whether you're
selected by March 15, well in advance of the April 15,
2017 early registration discount application deadline.
If selected for this Spotlight Session, you will register
accordingly on the website. Best wishes to you!

Jun23-27
Hi everyone,
I am writing to solicit applications from junior re-
searchers for a 5-minute talk in a \Spotlight Symposium"
that, as an Associate Editor at Evolution, I am orga-
nizing on a topic of my choice for the Society for the
Study of Evolution meetings in Portland, OR, June 23-
27, 2017. Here is how Spotlight Sessions are described
by the meeting organizers:
\Spotlight Sessions are more focused than a typical ses-
sion and have a dierent format. First, the talks are
solicited in advance. Second, each of the six Spotlight
Sessions will consist of 3 standard 15-minute talks inter-
spersed with sets of lightning (5-min) talks. We chose
this format by the logic that having several high-prole
researchers "anchoring\ a session on a specic topic
with a 15-minute talk will make it more valuable for
relatively junior researchers to give a 5-minute talk in a
focused session with the right target audience and other
relevant and well-known speakers rather than giving a
15-minute talk in a regular session."
My topic idea is \Sex in the Wild", which will focus
on exciting work relevant to the evolution/maintenance
of reproductive mode polymorphism in non-model or-
ganisms and/or using eld-based approaches to study
sex (and its alternatives) in natural populations. It
seems like a great opportunity to highlight this rela-24 EvolDir February 1, 2017
tively rare type of research, which is absolutely critical
to the study of sex but is often neglected in favor of
laboratory and/or model organism-focused studies.
The only problem is that we have no means to oset
travel or meeting costs, so I can't oer anything to the
speakers besides a spot in an exciting new type of sym-
posium featuring awesome speakers at a great meeting
in a very fun city.
Please contact me (maurine-neiman@uiowa.edu) by Jan.
31, 2017 if you're interested in being considered for a
5-minute talk and/or if you have any questions. I will
let you know whether you're selected by March 15, well
in advance of the April 15, 2017 early registration dis-
count application deadline. If selected for this Spotlight
Session, you will register accordingly on the website.
You can also sign up for a regular talk, along with your
Spotlight talk, if you'd like to do so.

Portland SSE Speciation Jun23-27
I am excited to solicit applications for 5-minute \light-
ning talks" for a Spotlight Session on \Speciation with
and without sex chromosomes" to be held at the up-
coming SSE conference in Portland OR, June 23-27,
2017.
Session description: Studies of the genetics of speciation
frequently focus on sex chromosomes. In fact, the \two
rules of speciation" (Coyne & Orr 1989) are both based
on sex chromosomes. In this symposium we address
how sex chromosomes aect speciation and explore how
speciation mechanisms may be dierent in the wide
diversity of taxa lacking sex chromosomes.
This is a new format for SSE and each Spotlight Session
will include three standard 15-minute talks interspersed
with six 5-minute talks. Unfortunately, there are no
funds to oset travel or meeting costs. Those who give 5-
minute Spotlight talks will also be permitted to register
for a 15-minute talk in a regular session.
Conrmed 15-minute spotlight speakers: Suzanne Ed-
mands (University of Southern California), NormanJohnson (University of Massachusetts, Amherst), Nicole
Valenzuela (Iowa State University)
If you are potentially interested in giving a 5-minute talk
in this session, please contact me (sedmands@usc.edu)
by Jan 31, 2017. I will let you know if you are selected
by March 15 and you would then register on the SSE
website (early registration deadline is April 15, 2017).

YosemiteNationalPark Symbiosis
May5-7 Registration
Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop - Registration Now Open:
Dear Colleagues,
The Seventh annual Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop will
take place on May 5th-7th, 2017 at the Sierra Nevada
Research Institute, Yosemite National Park. This has
become a great venue for a diversity of symbiosis re-
searchers. We hope to continue to attract a diverse
group in 2017!
Keynote speaker 2017: Dr. Corrie Moreau from the
Field Museum of Natural History.
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our continuing goal is to better integrate the
broad groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis re-search. Yosemite serves as an ideal site as it is both
beautiful and secluded. This will be our 7th annual
meeting and we have been consistently attracting scien-
tists from all over the country and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in cooper-
ation, mutualism, and symbiosis. In the past we have
covered a range of symbiosis topics from ecology and
evolution to molecular mechanisms in dierent model
and non-model systems. We would like to make room
for a diverse group of people so we will initially accept
up to 3 lab members per group (including the PI) on a
rst come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held May 6-
7, 2017, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 5th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting.
Abstract and early bird registration are due on March
6th, 2017.
Where: SNRS has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room.
Costs: See details in the registration page. We will only
be able to accept credit card payments this year. Your
registration is not activated until you have completed
the payment process. NOTE that the payment link is
at the top of the registration page. The registration fee
includes room and board.

The origin of odorant receptors in insects
A PhD position is available to study the origins of a
unique family of receptors for odorants and pheromones
that arose early in the evolution of insects. Supported
from a grant from the prestigious Marsden Fund, thePhD project will address the timing and role of the rst
insect odorant receptors. Our hypothesis is that they
appeared just before the origin of insect ight and ex-
panded to ll roles in detecting food, predators and/or
mates in this new three dimensional environment. The
research will involve the isolation of candidate odorant
receptors from the transcriptomes and genomes of early
insects and their deorphaning in surrogate cell systems.

the coevolution of interacting species, particularly how
mutualists shape each others' genomic diversity, and
how interactions between species can help or hinder
adaptation to abiotic factors like climate.
Our research particularly focuses on the yucca-yucca

FUNDED PhD OPPORTUNITY
Mapping the molecular specicity of virus-host in-

www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/robertson >
A three and a half year PhD project is available in
the CVR's Viral Genomics & Bioinformatics group, <
http://www.bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk >from Septem-
ber 2017. The project will be computer-based and
will train the student in systems virology, evolution-
ary biology, bioinformatics/computational biology and
network biology/modelling. Please direct enquiries to
david.robertson@manchester.ac.uk,who will be moving
to CVR in 2017. Note, the deadline for applications is
23rd January 2017.
Project description Viruses exploit the molecular system
of an infected host in order to replicate. This requires
an intricate set of molecular interactions between the
virus and the host system, placing a high degree of
specicity on the virus-host relationship. The key to
better understanding this relationship will be to study
the coevolutionary changes between viruses and their
host, in particular the precise nature of the interactions
involved, i.e., a viruses' ability to mimic host molecular
interactions and events, in the context of the host's
response to infection. Depending on the student's inter-30 EvolDir February 1, 2017
ests there will be some exibility in terms of the focus
of the project, e.g., a study of HIV/retroviruses versus
bacteriophage infections. The aim will be to construct
the virus-host interaction network at the species level
and for case studies model the virus-host molecular in-
teraction network. These molecular interactions can
be represented as a dynamic network by considering
both temporal and spatial aspects of infection of a cell.
This will be represented as a directed network, and
properties of the host proteins investigated, for exam-
ple, their connectivity, control-status, and functional
relationships. Questions to be addressed include: How
many host species on average does a virus target? How
do viruses so eectively use and control the host system?
What changes contribute to host-switching? What con-
straints do the maintenance of host interactions place
on viral evolution? Given the inherently hierarchical
and multi-scale nature of function, how should infection
be modelled? The project can be tailored to candidates
with a background in virology, biology, bioinformat-
ics, computer science, machine learning, statistics or
mathematics.
To apply, please follow the steps detailed in 'How to
apply for a research degree': <http://www.gla.ac.uk/-
research/opportunities/howtoapplyforaresearchdegree/
>. When applying, please search for \Mapping the
molecular specicity of virus-host interactions" in the
programme description box.

are looking at how insect pollinators (primarily social
bees) respond to rapid land-use change by studying
behavioural ecology and trait evolution.

land-use change Supervisors: Dr Richard Gill & Dr Nick

Application deadline: 19th January 2017 The past
century has seen rapid rates of agricultural land use
change, yet our understanding of how animal popu-
lations have responded to such newly-emerging agri-
landscapes over decadal time frames is still limited. A
further complication is that some species appear to have
coped better with agri-LUC than others, resulting in
so called 'winners and losers', and thus understanding
the traits underpinning success or failure is key to their
future protection. This project will look at an aspect
of plant-pollinator phenology to investigate whether
agri-landscapes have selected for change in insect pol-
linator life-history and functional response traits. For

Deadline: 20th January 2017
Start date: March (as soon as possible)
Project description
As human populations grow, the habitats for many
species are becoming increasingly urbanized. Thus, un-
derstanding how urbanization aects individuals, popu-
lations, and species is important to prevent loss of bio-
diversity and maintain functional ecosystems. The aim
of the project is to investigate whether urban environ-
mental stress, particularly with respect to air pollution,
noise and articial lighting at night, resulting in: (i)
increased physiological stress response, which will be
examined by measuring antioxidants, stress hormonesand gene expression; (ii) increased physiological damage
which is examined by measuring the oxidative damage
and telomere attrition, and/or (iii) changes in behaviors
such as sleep and food intake. In particular, experimen-
tal studies with zebra nches will be implemented, but
also eld studies will be part of the project. The eld
work will be based in Southern Sweden and of urban
and rural populations of tit species. The project is
multidisciplinary with elements of evolutionary ecology,
conservation, toxicology and biochemistry.
The PhD project will be part of the above project, how-
ever, the specic focus of the thesis will be developed
by the candidate together with the supervisor when
starting. The candidate is expected, regardless of the
focus of the dissertation, to participate and run its own
experiments and collect tissue samples both from cap-
tive and wild birds, and then analyze them in the lab.
A student who is only interested in one or the other is
not suitable for the project. Students are also expected
to read a number of courses equivalent to 60 credits.
These studies must be of both depth and width of the
character.
Required qualications
A masters degree in Biology focusing on either evolu-
tionary ecology, molecular ecology and/or ecophysiology.
For this position it is important to have experience with
handling birds and to have laboratory experience: an
advantage is to have training in molecular techniques.
It is a requirement that spoken and written English is
excellent. It is also a requirement to have a drivings
license and a car at the starting date.
Eligibility Students with basic eligibility for third-cycle
studies are those who- have completed a second-cycle
degree- have completed courses of at least 240 credits, of
which at least 60 credits are from second-cycle courses,
or- have acquired largely equivalent knowledge in some
other way, in Sweden or abroad.
The employment of doctoral students is regulated in the
Swedish Code of Statues 1998: 80. Only those who are
or have been admitted to PhD-studies may be appointed
to doctoral studentships. When an appointment to a
doctoral studentship is made, the ability of the student
to benet from PhD-studies shall primarily be taken
into account. In addition to devoting themselves to their
studies, those appointed to doctoral studentships may
be required to work with educational tasks, research and
administration, in accordance with specic regulations
in the ordinance.

NEVOL - Function & Evolution Subject: There is a
strongly repetitive and convergent evolution of presumed
graviportal specializations in amniote evolutionary his-
tory that highlights the major impact of biomechan-
ical constraints on anatomical macroevolution. This
project proposes to investigate the morphological and
microanatomical changes in weight bearing long bones
associated to the evolution of graviportality in rhinocero-
toids.
Beyond the ve extant species from the family
Rhinocerotidae (that will be extensively analyzed), the
diversity in Rhinocerotoidea is much richer, with two
additional families: Amynodontidae and Hyracodonti-
dae. Very distinct morphologies are observed within this
group and dierent ecologies with notably semi-aquatic
and exclusively terrestrial forms.
Analyzing the changes observable between rather small
and extremely large forms, but also between gracile and
massive ones will be important to understand the skele-
tal changes associated with the repeated evolution of
large body mass within this group. The aim will be to
distinguish adaptations linked to graviportality and to a
semi-aquatic lifestyle, respectively. The combination of
these results with the ecological data available for extant
taxa will enable to better characterize the link betweenecology, functional requirements and bone inner and
outer structure. In addition to providing robust and
integrative data about the inner and outer bone changes
linked to graviportality, this project will also enable to
perform paleoecological inferences on fossil forms.
This project will necessitate to perform 3D geomet-
ric morphometric (after acquisition by photogramme-
try, surface scanning, or microtomography) analyses on
limb long bones of a large sample of modern and fossil
rhinocerotoids for a detailed comparison of bone shape.
In addition, for the bones scanned using microtomogra-
phy, the complete bone microstructure will be analyzed
in 3D. The study requires thus an important time of 3D
data analysis.
This PhD is part of an ERC project whose larger ob-
jective is to model the relationship between bone mor-
phology, microanatomy and the functional requirements
of body support and locomotion in graviportal taxa
through amniote evolutionary history.
Financial information: The PhD will be nanced as part
of an ERC project.
The material necessary for this project is present in
the collections of various museums. If many specimens
are available in the collections of the MNHN, visits to
several museums will be required in addition to loans.
All the required technical support is available at the
MNHN.
Start: 01/09/2017 / Duration: 3 years Candidate pro-

some experience in 3D data analysis; dynamic, able to
work autonomously as well as in a team; good level in

Increase in body size seems to have occurred quickly in

been accompanied by changes in limb and bone propor-

The Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology (De-
partment of Entomology) in Jena has an opening for a
PhD student (m/f).
Project Description The eld of ecological immunol-
ogy seeks to understand the evolutionary and ecological
process which shaped and maintained variation in in-
sect immunity. Recently, our group demonstrated that
adaptation by the specialist /Heliothis subexa/ (He-
liothine) to withanolides, an anti-herbivore compound
of /Physalis/ plants, directly and indirectly protect the
larvae from bacterial pathogens [1]. Beyond simply coun-
tering plant-produced compounds, /H. subexa/ has
succeeded in converting the inhibitory eects of withano-
lides into activation eects for its own advantage. In the
context of a DFG funded project, the PhD student will
work on the mechanisms by which /H. subexa/ over-
came the inhibitory eects of withanolides. The project
is based on three major objectives, (1) Identication
and characterization of possible withanolide receptors or
decoy proteins, (2) Analysis of withanolide metabolism,
(3) Impact of withanolides on plant and larval gut mi-
crobiome. Furthermore, the PhD student will analyze
the eects of other plant-produced anti-herbivore com-
pounds on the immune system of specialist insects to
identify general eects of plant chemistry on ecological
immunology.
We are looking for a motivated student with a University
degree (M.Sc. or equivalent) and a focus on molecular
biology, biochemistry, immunology, zoology, evolution
or equivalent discipline. We expect good verbal and
written communication skills. Experience working with
proteomic, transcriptomic and/or metabolomic data as
well as knowledge of dierent research methodologies
(e.g. PCR; DNA, RNA and protein extraction; Western
Blot; Enzyme assays; Cell and/or bacterial cultures;
Insect rearing) are a plus.
We oer excellent technical equipment and close super-
vision in an international environment. A structured
PhD program is oered by our graduate school (IMPRS)
which provides interdisciplinary training by seminars,
lectures and scientic workshops. The payment and
benets are based on the TV oD guidelines and the ap-
pointment is for 3 years with possibility of extension.
The position is available from now. The Max Planck
Society is committed to increasing the number of indi-36 EvolDir February 1, 2017
viduals with disabilities in its workforce and therefore
encourages applications from such qualied individuals.
Furthermore, the Max Planck Society seeks to increase
the number of women in those areas where they are
underrepresented and therefore explicitly encourages
women to apply.
Application Questions concerning the project or the
position are welcome and should be addressed to Dr.

We are recruiting two graduate students (MSc or PhD)
to work on the ecology and genetics of adaptation and
geographic range limits in owering plants endemic to
the wonderful Pacic coastal dunes of California and
adjacent Oregon and Baja California. The students
would be co-supervised by Chris Eckert (Queen's U)
and Karen Samis (U Prince Edward Island) and basedFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 37
in the Biology Department at Queen's University in
Kingston, Ontario, Canada.
Our research programs provide opportunities for diverse
graduate student projects, and PhD students, especially,
are encouraged to develop their own research directions.
Here are some examples:
(1) Using experimental evolution to investigate con-
straints on adaptation at and beyond geographical range
limits. (2) Contribution of hybridization to adaptation
across geographic ranges. (3) Does geographic variation
in metapopulation dynamics yield stable range limits?
(4) Reproductive isolation during diversication of the
mating system and life history across species' ranges.
All projects will involve considerable eld work in Cal-
ifornia, Oregon and Mexico, eld experiments and ge-

/post.queensu.ca/ ~birdpop/index.html As numerically
dominant apex predators, seabirds are key components
of Canada's arctic marine ecosystem. Seabirds and
their eggs also are important to the culture and diet
of indigenous Arctic peoples. However, Arctic seabird
populations are facing multiple simultaneous direct and
indirect threats from climate change, shipping and in-
dustrial development. Unsurprisingly, many populations38 EvolDir February 1, 2017
are showing signs of stress such as reduced reproduc-
tive success or declining numbers. To avoid extinction,
wildlife populations must adapt through (1) changes in
behaviour or physiology, (2) dispersal, or (3) genetic
changes. The capacity for seabirds to adapt through
these three avenues is virtually unknown, but it is criti-
cal to maintenance of healthy populations. New genomic
methods, especially when combined with on-going stud-
ies of behaviour and physiology, provide powerful oppor-
tunities to determine the long-term sensitivities of Arctic
seabirds to climate change and industrial development.
We will use genomic, behavioural and ecological data
in a landscape context to estimate levels of phenotypic
plasticity, dispersal, and genomic variation for seven
seabird species that Canada has a global responsibility
to protect. Results will help Environment and Climate
Change Canada (ECCC) develop science-based policies
for Arctic stewardship. The students will be responsi-
ble for analysis of one species, and will gain training
in population and landscape genomics, bioinformatics,
population modeling and arctic ecology.

PhD Position: The tness consequences of spatial cog-
nition in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris
Closing date: Midnight, 31st January 2017
A fully-funded 3-year PhD studentship is available to
join the Insect Cognition Lab at Royal Holloway Uni-
versity of London, under the supervision of Dr. Elli
Leadbeater. The studentship covers tuition fees, a stu-
dent stipend of 16 296 per year (in line with Research
Council stipends) and research costs. The position is
open to UK and Non-UK EU applicants, and must start
on August 1st 2017 (although provision can be made
for applicants who are due to nish a Master's degree
in September 2017).
There is evidence from diverse animal groups that de-
mand for high-level performance in spatial memory tasks
selects for brain structural evolution, and foraging bees
face spatial challenges on multiple levels. For example,
long-term recall of visual landmarks is important in
re-locating the nest or feeding sites, while on a shorter
timescale, individuals must navigate through dense for-
age patches that may contain hundreds of owers, with-out revisiting inorescences. Here, we will investigate
the cognitive abilities that bumblebees employ to meet
these demands. The PhD student will (a) seek to es-
tablish for the rst time whether bees form working
memories of individual ower locations (b) explore the
capacity and temporal properties of such memories (c)
evaluate the power of cognitive task scores to predict
performance in a tness-determining spatial assay.
The student will be based in the School of Biological
Sciences at Royal Holloway University of London. Our
department is a centre of excellence for social insect
research, and the project will capitalize upon our EU-
funded research apiaries. The PhD student will join a
diverse and productive team of researchers in the Insect
Cognition Lab. She or he will work independently in
developing the protocols for the PhD project, but the
position is part of a Leverhulme-Trust funded research
project into the tness consequences of cognitive abilities
in bees, and the student will also contribute to data col-
lection for the wider project and will work closely with
the other team members. More information about the
research that takes place in our group can be found at
http://ellileadbeater.wixsite.com/insectcognition . Ap-
plicants should have a 1st Class or 2:1 Bachelor's degree
in a relevant Biological or Psychological subject. A
Masters degree is desirable, with a grade (or expected
grade) of Merit or Distinction. Experience of working
with insects is not essential, but the successful candidate
will have experience of independent research with live
animals (e.g. through an undergraduate or postgraduate
research project) and must be able to provide strong evi-
dence of aptitude and enthusiasm for research in Animal
Behaviour, together with a broad knowledge of biolog-
ical topics and a rm grasp of appropriate statistical
methods.

genes, to ascertain their roles in mediating variation in
human psychological phenotypes.
Imprinted genes are expressed from either the copy from

Under Climate Change
The Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment

one of three institutes within Western Sydney University.
The plant adaptation group at HIE is widely recognised

We are now seeking a highly motivated PhD student to
contribute to a NSW Environmental Trust project \A
scientic basis for assisted gene migration under climate
change". The project objectives are:
Characterise neutral and adaptive genetic variation to
estimate demographic and evolutionary processes. Do
warm/dry populations harbour adaptive variation for
drought resilience? Determine the ecological and physio-
logical capacity to respond to climate change. Do plants
growing under rainfall regimes found in their native
source population outperform plants from dierent cli-
mates ('local-is-best')? Do warm/dry populations have
higher resilience to drought?
Understanding the capacity of trees to respond to cli-
mate change is essential for the maintenance of biodi-February 1, 2017 EvolDir 41
versity, forest health and productivity. Climate change
has increased the frequency and intensity of droughts,
which has resulted in tree death and negatively aected
essential ecosystem services. Adaptive land manage-
ment is urgently needed in order to mitigate the risk
of large-scale drought mortality in a rapidly changing
climate. Assessing genetic adaptation and physiologi-
cal tolerance to drought across species distributions is
critically important if we are to develop management
tools, such as assisted gene migration, for sustainable
and productive forests in a drying climate.
The project will focus on dominant Eucalyptus species
in eastern Australia and compare populations from
coastal, tableland, and western bioregions with repli-
cation across latitudes. The student will undertake
genotyping-by-sequencing (ddRAD) to assess genetic
structure and identify adaptive variation for climate
change. Temperature and water manipulations under
controlled glasshouse conditions will be employed to
test for genetic adaptation and determine physiological
tolerance to drought and heatwaves.
The student will be based at HIE, working under the
supervision of Dr Paul Rymer and Prof. David Tissue,
and engage with the project partners Oce of Environ-
ment and Heritage, Greening Australia, and Local Land
Services.
What does the scholarship provide? Domestic students
will receive a tax free stipend of $27,000 per annum and
a funded place in the doctoral degree. International
students will receive a tax free stipend of $27,000 per
annum. Those with a strong track record may receive
a fee waiver. Funding is available for project costs and

Criteria We welcome applicants from a wide range of
backgrounds, especially those with a strong grounding
in ecology, genetics or plant biology who are keen to
apply their quantitative skills to key questions in current
biology. The successful applicant should:

PhD position on computational models of collective
escape of bird ocks 1.0 fte (217006)
Organisation
Founded in 1614, the University of Groningen enjoys an
international reputation as a dynamic and innovative
center of higher education oering high-quality teaching
and research. Flexible study programmes and academic
career opportunities in a wide variety of disciplines en-
courage the 30,000 students and researchers alike to
develop their own individual talents. As one of the
best research universities in Europe, the University of
Groningen has joined forces with other top universities
and networks worldwide to become a truly global center
of knowledge.
The Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences
(GELIFES) GELIFES, the largest institute of the Fac-
ulty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMNS) lls
a special niche in the life sciences by covering and in-February 1, 2017 EvolDir 43
tegrating mechanistic, evolutionary and ecological ap-
proaches, aiming to understand adaptation on all levels
of biological organisation. Researchers pursue funda-
mental questions while collaborating with partners from
industry, medicine and other realms of society. Our re-
search elds include behavioural biology, chronobiology,
ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics and genomics,
neurobiology, physiology and theoretical modelling, us-
ing a wide array of research tools. Research levels range
from molecular and organismal to population and com-
munity, performed under laboratory, semi-natural and
eld conditions.
Job description
One of the advantages of group life, such as in birds, is
increased protection against predation. Increased pro-
tection is, for instance, assured by the complex patterns
of collective escape by bird ocks under attack. These
patterns may confuse the predator. Collective behaviour
of ocks is, however, dicult to investigate empirically.
As a solution, the proposed project concerns the com-
putational modelling of collective escapes. This is done
with the help of empirical data collected by another
PhD candidate using robot-falcons (RoboFalcons) for
controlled attacks on ocks. The empirical study is
aimed at driving ocks away in a specic direction for
preventing collisions between ocks and airplanes. The
PhD candidates will closely exchange data and results.
The modelling project aims to gain understanding on
what causes dierent patterns of collective escape under
dierent conditions. For this, the PhD candidate will
extend our computational model, StarDisplay, and may
develop new models. The model will be informed by
two empirical sources, namely, the experiments with
RoboFalcons and the movies of huge starling ocks
under attack by Peregrine falcons above Rome. The
student will experiment with dierent escape strategies
and attack strategies in the model to improve both un-
derstanding of the observations of patterns of collective
escape and methods of driving ocks away.
Daily supervision will come from Prof. Charlotte Hemel-
rijk and Dr Hanno Hildenbrandt; Dr Colin Torney (Glas-
gow, UK) will co-supervise the project.
Qualications
The successful candidate will have previous research
experience in theoretical modelling, be in good com-
mand of the English language (oral and written) and
possess excellent communication skills (indicated by
the ability to write scientic papers and deliver presen-
tations). Since studies on self-organisation are highly
interdisciplinary, successful candidates are expected to
demonstrate an active and supportive approach to inter-
disciplinary research and collaborate with other groupmembers. Suitable candidates can be either individuals
with a background in the computational (life) sciences,
with interest in evolutionary and biological questions, or
evolutionary biologists with experience in computational
modelling.
Candidates for the PhD position should have: - MSc in
theoretical biology, a MSc in computational science with
focus on biology or an MSc in computational physics
with specialization in biology, MSc in Articial Intelli-
gence with a specialization in an area of computational
or mathematical biology or a MSc in Biology, with a spe-
cialization in an area of computational or mathematical
biology - experience with developing computer simula-
tion code and a sucient background in mathematics
- a strong interest in collective, swarming behaviour,
biomechanics of ight, attack and escape. Candidates
with research experience in these areas are particularly
encouraged to apply.

Erasmus Mundus Master Program in Evolutionary Bi-
ology (MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master program
for talented and motivated students who are interested
in understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats44 EvolDir February 1, 2017
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four Euro-
pean universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands;
University of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,
Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA). Together, this consortium has put together an
attractive multidisciplinary program that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at (at least)
two partner universities, and they will receive a double
degree from two partner universities they have attended.
Being nanced by the European Community, MEME
has to satisfy the high quality standards imposed the
prestigious Erasmus+ Program. A limited number of full
scholarships is available for European and non-European
students and these will be awarded in a selective pro-
cedure. Details on the program and the selection pro-
cedure can be found on www.evobio.eu . Starting date:

(LGM). To reach these goals, study sites in northwestern
and northern Madagascar will be visited for the joint
collection of (paleo)ecological and population datasets
and samples of mouse lemurs in direct vicinity to each
other. The lemur samples will be analyzed by applying
NGS technologies.
The successful candidate will join a multi-disciplinary
eld team and spend a period of 6 months in Mada-
gascar for sample collection and the determination of
lemur abundance in several study sites. We oer the
opportunity for the acquisition of a doctoral degree in
the framework of this study.
Applicants should hold a M.Sc degree in biology or
equivalent qualication. A high motivation for a multi-
facetted project that includes substantial amount of eld
work under remote and basic living conditions as well as
advanced bioinformatics techniques on large molecular
datasets will be a prerequisite. Good language abilities
in English, both orally and in writing, are required and
some knowledge of French would be benecial. Previ-
ous experience with tropical countries and with eld
techniques such as capture or handling of animals or
distance sampling is a plus. Experience with molecular
techniques such as sequencing and analysis of popula-
tion genetic datasets would be highly benecial. In
addition, the applicant should have a high capability
of self organization and the ability to work in a team
as well as independently under dicult eld working
conditions.February 1, 2017 EvolDir 45

UHongKong ConservationGenetics
A fully funded PhD studentship is available for the study
of population genetics and conservation biology of the
endangered tree Aquilaria sinensis at the University of
Hong Kong, in collaboration with Kadoorie Farm and
Botanic Garden, Hong Kong.
Aquilaria sinensis, also known as incense tree or agar-
wood tree, is one of the most famous medicinal plants in
Hong Kong and China. However, due to the rising de-
mands for agarwood, this species is threatened by illegal
felling throughout the region. To conserve and maintain
healthy incense tree populations in Hong Kong, there
is an urgent need to study the conservation genetics
of this species. We now seek a high calibre student to
(1) study the genetic diversity of Aquilaria sinensis in
Hong Kong and understand how the genetic diversity
is aected by illegal felling; (2) understand the genetic
variation of Aquilaria sinensis at dierent age classes,
and disentangle the gene ow patterns of this species.
This work will contribute to the synthesis of a Species
Action Plan and information gained from this project
will be useful for conservation and restoration of this
species in Hong Kong and throughout the region.
Prospective students with a background in conservation
biology or population genetics are encouraged to apply.A strong academic record, evidence of excellent writing
and analytical skills, as well as enthusiasm for eld and
laboratory research will be a plus.
The PhD studentship includes a postgraduate schol-
arship, travel insurance and research support for four
years. To apply, please send application materials, in-
cluding a cover letter and copies of academic transcripts,
resume and contact information for 3 references to saun-
ders@hku.hk, gscher@kfbg.org or hzhang@kfbg.org.

We are advertising a cluster of projects on the evolution
of parental care funded by University of Hull including
two PhD studentships and a postdoctoral position super-
vised by Drs Isabella Capellini, Lesley Morrell and James
Gilbert. For details about the postdoctoral position,
soon to be open, please contact I.Capellini@hull.ac.uk.
To be considered for the shortlist, interested applicants
are strongly advised to contact the relevant lead super-
visor well in advance of application. Please enclose a CV
and a brief explanation of why this position interests
you, and any questions you have. Applicants should
have at least a 2.1 undergraduate degree in Biology,
Ecology, or related discipline, together with relevant
research experience. A 1st class undergraduate degree
or Masters level qualication are anticipated.
There are astonishing dierences in whether, how, and
for how long, animals care for their ospring. In most
species, such as many marine shes, parents abandon
their fertilized eggs, which are mostly eaten by preda-
tors. By contrast, parents of other species, as in humans,
provide protection and substantial amount of resources
to their eggs or ospring.
PhD 1: Evolution of parents feeding ospring. Lead
Supervisor: Dr James Gilbert, james.gilbert@hull.ac.uk
Parental feeding is rare among animals. The studentship46 EvolDir February 1, 2017
will focus on this crucial but little-understood behaviour.
Insects are excellent for asking evolutionary questions
about parental care: strategies are diverse, and often
dier among related species. The student will rst com-
plete and publish a large reproductive trait database for
insects, begun by Dr Gilbert, and second, in a broad
comparative analysis across many species, address the
following questions: (1) What ecological factors favour
the evolution and/or maintenance of parental provision-
ing? Does provisioning evolve with harsh or stable en-
vironments; scarce, specialized resources; or predation?
Is loss of ospring self-suciency a key precondition for
the evolution of parental provisioning? (2) What are
the evolutionary consequences of a food-provisioning
strategy? Is optional (or partial) food provisioning be-
haviour inherently unstable? The project will deepen
our understanding of an extremely important group,
insects, and provides key comparisons not available in
groups like mammals who uniformly feed ospring.
Further requirements: experience essential with at least
one out of: database management, phylogenies, insect
behaviour studies; two or more desirable. Experience
with R desirable.

Laterality and parental care in sh. Lead Supervisor:
Dr Lesley Morrell, l.morrell@hull.ac.uk
Long thought to be unique to humans, lateralisation
(or handedness) is now recognised as widespread in ver-
tebrates. Animals show lateralisation in a wide range
of organs and behaviours, and it is hypothesised that
cerebral lateralisation can enhance cognitive abilities,
particularly through the ability to attend to multiple
tasks at one time (multitasking). For sh, this might
be the ability to simultaneously forage and remain vig-
ilant for predators, for example. In this project, we
will investigate the potential link between lateralisation,
parental care and other ecological factors in sh. More
specically, the project seeks to address the following
questions: 1) Within and across species, are individu-
als that provide care more likely to be lateralised than
individuals that do not? 2) How does laterality link
to the ability to multitask in caring and non-caring sit-
uations? 3) How do environmental conditions shape
laterality, and how does this link to the ability to multi-
task? Experimental work on the behaviour of sh in the
Universitys aquarium facilities will be a key component
of this project.
Further requirements: essential to the project are good
skills and experience with experimental work, preferen-
tially in behavioural ecology and/or with sh; experiencewith R desirable.
How to apply: Application is online at the

will start on the 25th September 2017. Full-time UK/EU
PhD Scholarships will include fees at the home/EU stu-
dent rate and maintenance (pounds 14,121 in 2016/17)

SeychellesWarblersFitness
A funded PhD studentship on \Individual variation
in reproductive success in the cooperatively breeding
Seychelles warbler" is available at the University of
Leeds, UK, supervised by Dr Hannah Dugdale and
co-supervised by Dr Simon Goodman. The PhD is
in collaboration with Prof Terry Burke (University of
Sheeld), Prof David S Richardson (University of East
Anglia), Prof Jan Komdeur (University of Groningen)
and Nature Seychelles (www.natureseychelles.org).
Accurate measures of tness components, such as sur-
vival and reproduction, are fundamental to the study of
evolutionary and conservation biology. However, tness
can be very dicult to measure in natural populations,
e.g., individuals may disperse from the study area. Even
in closed populations where survival can be monitored
accurately, parentage can be hard to assign from be-
haviour alone, and requires the use of genetic mark-
ers. This requires genetic samples, which are usually
obtained from ospring soon after hatching/birth. How-
ever, measuring tness at this early life-history stage
can be problematic as selection can act at dierent time
points in life, aecting ospring at various ages. Fitness
therefore needs to be measured at multiple life-history
stages, and extend to grand-ospring, when investigat-
ing individual variation in reproductive success. Few
studies have done this, as extensive, detailed long-term
studies are required. The proposed study will use such
data to investigate a range of key factors that impact
on individual reproductive success in a cooperatively
breeding system of Seychelles warblers. Understanding
variation in reproductive success will provide important
information to guide the long-term conservation eortsFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 47

Why you should apply: The University of Leeds is in

In particular, we will provide supervision in life-history
evolution, social evolution and conservation biology, and
we will encourage you to develop your own research ideas.
You will gain specialist training in molecular ecology

Overview
The population genetics and evolution of great apes
(chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans) are of par-
ticular interest because this group is the most closely
related to humans, yet critically endangered. Species
and subspecies taxonomy has been labile over the last
20 years, and driven by molecular genetic data. Whole-
genome data have given insights into gene ow between
groups [1], with population isolates showing high ge-
netic drift (particularly in mountain gorillas [2]), which
has important implications for conservation genetics.
Pathogens (e.g. Ebola) are decimating wild populations
and imposing strong selection that will lead to adap-
tation. There is a clear need to better understand the
structures of wild populations in their environments.
The genetic diversity of wild populations is strongly
inuenced by mating patterns and sex-biased dispersal,
including the inuence of sperm competition. Analysis
of DNA variants in the male-specic region of the Y
chromosome (MSY) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
has contributed much to understanding these factors in
many mammalian species. Until recently, typing of mul-
tiple short-tandem repeats (STRs) [3] has been the only
way to assess MSY diversity in great apes. We have se-
quenced several megabases of MSY via next-generation
sequencing (NGS), deriving a detailed MSY phylogeny
(Fig. 1) containing thousands of single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) [4]. In our zoo-based sample this
distinguishes well between (sub)species and reveals dra-
matic dierences suggesting diverse sex-biased processes.
This project will expand the MSY tree by NGS analysis
of additional great-ape individuals, to properly under-
stand STR/SNP haplogroup relationships, and to de-
velop methods to type MSY SNPs and STRs, as well as
mtDNA, in non-invasive samples such as faeces and hair
from wild populations. As well as allowing a large-scale
approach to demography and sex-biased processes in
samples from natural environments, such methods will
be also be adapted for in-eld analysis of bushmeat
samples in order to combat a major threat to wild ape
populations, thus aiding conservation.
The project will envolve the initial establishment of
'conventional' methods for assessing diversity, includ-
ing building uorescent PCR multiplexes, analysis via
capillary electrophoresis, set-up of software for auto-
matic allele calling, PCR primer design, SNP typing,
and Sanger sequencing.
PCR-based and sequence capture approaches will be
established for next-generation (Illumina MiSeq) and
third-generation sequencing platforms (MinION; Oxford48 EvolDir February 1, 2017
Nanopore Technologies). Methods will be adapted and
validated for non-invasive samples from the wild, and
MinION methods established for in-eld analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences and population-
genetic statistical analysis will be undertaken to illumi-
nate the population structures and evolution of great
ape (sub)species, to understand the roles of sex-biased
processes, and to aid in the establishment of conserva-
tion strategies.

phd-studentships Overview: Human genetic variation
commonly exhibits geographic structuring as a con-
sequence of demographic history (such as population
subdivision, migration, and admixture or replacement),
as well as locus-specic forces such as selection, muta-
tion and recombination. Thus, dissecting the patterns
of this variation is important for the reconstruction
of human evolutionary history, and can contribute to
the understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic
adaptation and complex disease. Drawn by the
knowledge of high levels of genetic diversity and low
levels of linkage disequilibrium (which have important
implications for the mapping of disease susceptibility
loci), geneticists are increasingly turning their attention
to Africa, the continent of origin of our species. The
African Genome Variation Project has enhanced
our understanding of the genetic variation in West,
West-central and East Africa, and started to reveal
the inuence of pre-historical and historical large-scale
migrations and expansions on the distribution of the
genetic diversity across the continent.
Here, we propose to complement these studies with a
detailed genomic study of our own collection of samples,
and to provide a detailed characterization of the timing
and extent of important recent migrations that occurred
within Africa and from Africa to the Americas. Firstly,
the student will combine public African datasets with
our samples from Southwest and Southeast Africa to
model the signicant demographic shift in Sub-Saharan
Africa that took place during the Bantu expansion. Sec-
ondly, they will combine this extended contemporary
African dataset with ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses of
human remains recovered from slave cemeteries located
in the main receiving ports in Northeast and South-
east Brazil, and modern DNA analyses of descendants
of enslaved Africans (Brazilians) collected in the same
regions, to investigate the ethnic origins, demographic
history and contemporary legacies of the trans-Atlantic
slave trade. Given the historical evidence on dierent
forced migratory routes from Africa to the Northeast-
ern and Southeastern Brazilian ports, the shift in the
relative importance of these routes through time, and
the large number of slaves carried (ten times more than
were carried to North America), the study of the African
diaspora in Brazil provides a unique opportunity to un-
derstand the population dynamics of the trans-Atlantic
slave trade. The student will apply both analytical andFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 49
simulation-based methods to test dierent evolutionary
scenarios, and to infer the main population parameters
(such as population sizes, divergence times, migration
rates, and timing and magnitude of recent admixture
events) that gave rise to the contemporary diversity of
European and European-derived populations.
By using such a complete dataset and state-of-the-art
techniques, the project will be able to shed light on
the demographic history of Africa and of populations
inuenced by African migrations, and on the funda-
mental processes of human migration. Finally, pairing
this genomic data with ecological, historical, linguistic
and other socio-economical variables, as well as with
morphological and biomedical trait values such as skin
colour, body mass index and blood pressure, the stu-
dent will be able to interpret a range of genetic and
non-genetic dimensions of African variation, including
disease susceptibility, morphologic variation, linguistic
dierentiation, and cultural and social practices.
Applicants should expect to hold a 1st or 2.1 BSc in a
relevant eld by the end of September 2017 when the stu-
dentship will commence. Those holding a 2.2 degree plus
a Master's degree or >3 years relevant post-graduate

Project Description
Knowledge of dispersal in mosquitoes such as Aedes
aegypti, the vector of dengue, Zika and chikungunya
viruses, is critical to the implementation of several meth-
ods of disease control. For example, the eectiveness
of insecticide spraying depends upon immigration rate
of new mosquitoes into the treated area and spacing
of the release of sterile males depends upon dispersal
distance and ease of movement through the landscape.
Population genetics methods potentially oer the most
powerful approach to infer dispersal from estimates of
gene ow. However, estimating gene ow on the ecolog-
ically relevant (i.e. recent) time frames for control of
mosquito borne disease is non-trivial, as estimates are
confounded by historical eects in most existing meth-
ods of analysis. Population genomics (i.e. population
genetics on a genome wide scale) oers the potential
for a new approach to tackle this problem due to the
large amounts of data that can be generated. In this
project, the student will generate and analyse genomic
sequence data in a population genomics and landscape
genomics framework to understand gene ow in and evo-
lution of Aedes aegypti on a scale relevant for disease
transmission control.
This studentship is suitable for students with either bio-
logical or mathematical backgrounds. During the stu-
dentship, the student will develop a deep understanding
of population genetics theory. The project will involve
a limited amount of eldwork to collect mosquitoes and
some molecular genetics work in the laboratory. How-
ever, the project will largely focus on the analysis of
genetic data and, as necessary, the development of novel
and modication of existing analytical approaches. The
primary aim of the project is to characterise recent gene
ow and any landscape barriers to mosquito dispersal.
However, from the genomic data it will also be possible
to infer demographic history and identify genes that
may be under positive adaptive selection; such genes
are likely to be particularly relevant to disease trans-
mission and/or control. The methodological approaches
developed will be relevant to a wide range of problems
concerned with man-made environmental change (e.g.
the spread of pest species and the conservation of species
of conservation concern).

*A PhD position is available to study extreme stress
responses in the notorious bdelloid rotifers, UNamur,

A PhD position is available immediately to start work-
ing on the oxidative stress responses of bdelloid rotifers
following desiccation and radiation within the group of
Prof. Karine Van Doninck (Laboratory of Evolutionary
Genetics and Ecology) and Dr. Florence Chainiaux at
the University of Namur (Belgium).
While several metazoan asexual lineages exist, the most
notorious and successful clade is the bdelloid rotifers
containing at least 460 morphospecies that seems to
have evolved for tens of millions of years without sexual
reproduction (including fertilization and meiosis with
pairing of homologous chromosomes). Besides their
asexual mode of reproduction, they are also well-known
for their extreme desiccation and radiation resistance.
Entering a desiccated state is however harmful in most
animals and is expected to be accompanied by the gener-
ation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), known to induce
damages at the DNA, protein and lipid level if not neu-tralized by antioxidants. This PhD project will study
and characterize in detail the oxidative stress generated
during desiccation and radiation in the model bdelloid
species Adineta vaga and investigate their antioxidant
responses. Being funded by the European Space Agency,
this Phd will also investigate the impact of simulated mi-
cro gravity on oxidative stress responses and be involved
in space mission preparation.
This PhD position is for 1 year andcan start beginning of
February 2017, being funded by two projects, ESA (Eu-
ropean Space Agency) and ARC (Actions de Recherche
Concertees). An extension of another 3 years is possible
but the candidate will be encouraged to apply for its
own FRIA or FNRS Belgian PhD grant.
Prof. Karine Van Doninck recently acquired an ERC
Consolidator Grant to study the mechanisms of genome
evolution in the absence of meiosis in bdelloid rotifers;
this ERC CoG will start in 2017. This PhD will join a
very dynamic research lab including nowadays 5 post-
docs, 2 PhD students and 3 technicians at UNamur.

**EXTENDED DEADLINE**
University of Plymouth, UK
Fully funded PhD studentship with Dr Mike Thom
(Plymouth) and Dr Jon Bridle (Bristol) investigating
the role of sexual selection in adaptation to variable
environments.
The studentship will be available to start from 1st April2017, and must start by 1st October 2017 at the latest.
Project Description Understanding how organisms adapt
to changing environmental conditions is a central goal
of evolutionary biology, and one which has important
conservation application in helping to predict potential
impacts of environmental challenges on species distribu-
tions and diversity. Two key theoretical questions are (1)
how does temporal and/or spatial variability in the envi-
ronment aect evolutionary response to change, and (2)
how do various evolutionary mechanisms interact dur-
ing adaptation? This project will use an experimental
evolution approach with the model organism Drosophila
melanogaster to explore evolutionary responses to a
number of static and uctuating environmental chal-
lenges, focusing on the interplay between sexual and
natural selection during adaptation. The student will
use a variety of behavioural, physiological and quanti-
tative genetic techniques to investigate the phenotypic
signatures and genetic architecture of population level
responses to environmental variation.
The studentship is supported for 3 years and includes
full UK/EU tuition fees plus a stipend of 14,296 per
annum. The studentship will only fully fund those appli-
cants who are eligible for Home/EU fees with relevant
qualications. Applicants normally required to cover
overseas fees will have to cover the dierence between
the Home/EU and the overseas tuition fee rates (ap-
proximately 11,040 per annum).

Title: Genetic causes and ecological consequences of
owering initiation in Linum bienne
Project description: Global warming has shifted the
start of owering in many plant species. Spring starts
earlier in the UK and the North of Europe, where the
owering season has now extended. In Mediterranean
countries, owering also starts earlier, but its duration is
shorter to avoid the summer period and the dry season.
Although we have a relatively good understanding of
the pathways that trigger owering initiation, we are
still far from understanding how plants perceive and
respond to environmental and climatic variation to shift
from vegetative growth to initiate owering, and the
level to which global warming aects it. Furthermore,
an adaptive response to the stress imposed by global
warming can only occur if plant populations harbour
sucient genetic variation in owering initiation. In
this project, we will investigate variation in owering
initiation and in other plant traits to assess how they
aect seed production in Linum bienne. This will be
done in populations across its geographic range between
the South of Spain and the UK. The project will include
greenhouse experiments and common garden experi-
ments to estimate genetic and phenotypic variation, and
heritability of owering initiation and correlated traits
and plant performance. This will allow detecting lo-
cal adaptation associated to dierent environments and
climates in Europe. It will also help identifying popula-
tions resilient to global warming and prompt to provide
an adaptive response to climate change. Because L. bi-
enne is the wild crop relative of cultivated ax, measures
of traits with agronomic value will be included to assess
the potential of L. bienne to improve cultivated ax.
Candidates must have a Master degree, and background
in Plant Biology, Ecology and Evolution. The present
project will suit candidates interested on Evolutionary
Ecology, and with a prole in data analysis. The can-
didate should be familiar with R for data analysis of
ecological and molecular data, and exible to work in
a team and independently. It is expected that (s)he
will be active preparing grant proposal and manuscripts.
The candidate will gain skills both in the eld and the
lab, plant breeding, crop research, and data analysis.
The lab work and greenhouse experiments will be con-
ducted in the facilities of The University of Portsmouth.
The candidate will have access to the Graduate School
Development Programme and Department Postgradu-
ate Researcher Training, and will join the Biodiversity
and Evolution research team at the School of Biologi-
cal Science. Funding Notes:Home/EU applicants only.
Please use the online application form and state the
project code (BIOL3150217) and studentship title inthe personal statement section.

URochester.MolluscShellEvoDevo
PhD position in evolutionary development of gastropod
shells
A graduate student position is available for study of the
mechanisms of mollusc shell development. Molluscs are
one of the most diverse and successful animal groups, in
terms of body plans, species, and their ubiquity across
ecosystems and niches. Their success is likely due in
part to a key molluscan character{ the shell, a strong
and durable exoskeleton of calcium crystals.
Mollusc shells are a very powerful model system for
morphological evolution. They are extremely diverse
and disparate, and dierent morphologies can often be
directly related to functional dierences. They have an
exquisitely detailed fossil record, which allows morpho-
logical change to be tracked through evolutionary time.
Shells grow progressively, at the outer edge, so they
record ontogenetic change like no other animal struc-
ture. Despite the diversity of mollusc shell morphology,
the geometry of shell growth is relatively simple{ even
dramatic dierences in shell form can be explained by
dierences in basic parameters of shell growth. This has
made them a prominent system for modeling morpholog-
ical change. Indeed, work on mollusc shells inspired the
concept of morphospace{ the theoretical representation
of all the possible forms or structures of an organism.
In addition, shell biomineralization has been extensively
studied and is a model for materials science (Marin et
al., 2012). Despite the many strengths of mollusc shellsFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 57
for studies of morphological evolution, they have not
been tractable for mechanistic studies of the evolution
of development, because the developmental mechanisms
that control shell growth are not known.
The successful candidate will extend recent discoveries
in the Lambert lab at the University of Rochester. Stud-
ies will focus on the cellular behaviors in the mantle
epithelium that control shell shape, and on the genes
that regulate these processes. Methods will include
cell proliferation assays, RNA-seq, in situ hybridization
and gene knockdown studies. Further comparative and
modeling projects are also anticipated.

GeneticsAdapation
The Lowry Lab at Michigan State University is currently
seeking to hire two research technicians to study the
genetics of adaptation.
The rst technician will be hired through Michigan
State University and will participate in projects fo-
cused on identifying the genetic mechanisms of evo-
lutionary adaptations. The goals of the research are to
understand how adaptations contribute to the forma-
tion of new species and how those adaptations can be
exploited to improve bioenergy and food crops. The lab
uses three agship systems for research: Monkeyower
(*Mimulus guttatus*), Switchgrass (*Panicum virga-
tum*), and Common Bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris*). The
successful applicant will assist with research on all
three systems. Applicants should send their resume/CV
and contact information for at least two references
to David Lowry at dlowry@msu.edu. All applicants
must also formally apply for the job through the follow-
ing link: https://jobs.msu.edu/applicants/jsp/shared/-February 1, 2017 EvolDir 69
frameset/Frameset.jsp?time=3D1484159189609 .This
position will initially last for one year, with the possi-
bility of annual renewal contingent on the availability
of funding and satisfactory performance.
The second technician will be hired through the Uni-
versity of Texas, but be stationed at the Kellogg Bio-
logical Station in Hickory Corners, MI. This research
will be focused on a large collaborative project studying
adaptation in the bioenergy feedstock switchgrass. The
research will utilize new genetic mapping populations
to identify genomic regions responsible for adaptation
between northern upland and southern lowland ecotypes
of switchgrass. These mapping populations have been
planted at an unprecedented geographical scale, span-
ning ten common garden eld sites distributed over 17
degrees of latitude, making them ideal for studies of
regional adaptations. The technician will be primarily
responsible for maintaining and gathering data from the
switchgrass common garden located at MSU's Kellogg
Biological Station (KBS). The technician will also work
in the laboratory of David Lowry on MSU's main cam-
pus, especially during winter months. The research will
often involve all-day physical activity outdoors. The
technician will be expected to organize data collection
eorts and coordinate these eorts with the larger team
across the central United States. For more informa-
tion please on this position, please contact David Lowry
directly at dlowry@msu.edu.

Field assistant position for
great and blue tit population monitoring
We seek 2 eld assistants in urban ecology to work
in the Wild Urban Evolution & Ecology Lab (http://-
leem.cent.uw.edu.pl) at the Center of New Technologies
(CeNT), University of Warsaw (Poland) for a period
of 3 months from April to June 2017 or mid-April to
mid-July. The position is part of a 2-year Polonez grant
from the Polish Science Foundation (NCN) that aims to
investigate the eects of trace metal exposure on great
and blue tit physiology (i.e. oxidative stress, telomere
length) and tness (i.e. reproduction and survival) in a
gradient of urbanisation.
Background - Current anthropogenic activities are re-
sponsible for considerable modications of the natural
environment. Those include light, noise and chemical
pollution, which may have considerable impact at the
individual level and in terms of populations' dynamics
and functioning. Given the rapid increase in urbanisa-
tion worldwide, it is becoming increasingly important to
better understand the underlying mechanisms and the
potential impacts of anthropogenic pollution on natural
populations. Chemical pollution such as trace metals
are of particularly timely concern given their implicationFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 81
in several human diseases and their noxious eect on
wildlife (e.g. oxidative stress).
Job description - The eld assistants will participate in
eldwork, in collecting phenotypic data (i.e. morpho-
metric measurements) and other biological information.
The eld assistants may also oversee sample preserva-
tion and transportation to the lab. The team will be
split into couples to monitor all sites located in gradient
of urbanisation; most sites can be reached by public
transports.
Job requirements - We seek motivated candidates with
a strong interest in eld work of wild bird populations.
A previous experience in eld work, in population mon-
itoring or in bird handling would be appreciated. Pref-
erentially, the candidate should have a theoretical back-
ground in ecology, in physiology or in population biology.
Operational Polish language is essential, but because
English is the working language in the group, the candi-
date should be able to understand and speak English.
Driving licence and ringing licence are a plus.
Employment - Part or full-time position. The eld assis-
tant may work on any day of the week including weekend
and the working hours are exible.
Salary - depends on the assistant qualications and time
involvement in the project.
How to apply - Your application should include in
PDF format: a cover letter and C.V. (including
your research experience, formation and contact in-
formation). Please send your application to mar-
ion.chatelain@cent.uw.edu.pl as early as possible and
no later than the 31 ^th of January 2017 with the term
\Field assistant position" as e-mail subject line. Selected
candidates will be invited for live interview.
Field assistant position for arthropod sampling and

months from mid-April to mid-July 2017. The position
is part of a 2-year Polonez grant from the Polish Science

of trace metal exposure on great and blue tit physiology
(i.e. oxidative stress, telomere length) and tness (i.e.

Background - Current anthropogenic activities are re-
sponsible for considerable modications of the natural
environment. Those include light, noise and chemical
pollution, which may have considerable impact at the
individual level and in terms of populations' dynamicsand functioning. Given the rapid increase in urban-
isation worldwide, it is becoming increasingly impor-
tant to better understand the underlying mechanisms
of anthropogenic activities on natural populations. The
dierences of food availability between urban and rural
sites during the breeding season and more particularly
during chicks' rearing would explain part of the eects of
urbanisation on wild populations. Therefore, it is essen-
tial to measure food availability (i.e. arthropod richness,
abundance and diversity in the case of great and blue
tits) to then draw a detailed outline of urbanisation
eects on urban wild populations.
Job description - The eld assistants will take care of
arthropod sampling (in the eld), counting and iden-
tication (in the lab) to estimate food availability in
great and blue tits. Depending on their interest and
availability, they may also participate in collecting phe-
notypic data (i.e. morphometric measurements) and
other biological information in great and blue tits. Both
assistants will work together,

ASN RegionalMeeting Awards
ASN Awards for Support of Regional Meetings in Ecol-
ogy, Evolution and Behavior
The American Society of Naturalists solicits propos-
als from organizers of regional meetings in the elds
of ecology, evolution and behavior. The purpose of
these small awards is to promote increased participa-
tion in regional meetings that fall along the research
interests supported by the ASN and to use this sup-
port as a way of recruiting new membership to ASN.
The awards typically provide subsidized registration for
ASN members at these regional meetings. Please note
that these awards are not intended to support work-
shops. Previous awardees have included meetings such
as SEEPEG, SEEC, EVO-WIBO, and OE3C. Organiz-
ers of regional meetings should submit a brief proposal
describing the research focus of the meeting for which
funds are requested as well as details of the meeting such
as anticipated number of participants, meeting venue
and dates.
Instructions: Proposals should include two components.
One should clearly describe the (1) overlap of the re-
gional meeting with ASN research interests, (2) extent
that the support would reach out to new audiences to
grow ASN's membership, and (3) potential size of the
impact on ASN membership. The second component
should include a brief budget justifying the amount re-
quested and detailing how the funds will be used. To
standardize the applications, there is a strict one-pagelimit (US Letter size paper, 1? margins, standard [e.g.,
Times] 12-point font, and no more than six lines per inch)
for each component (i.e., 1 page for proposal, 1 page
for budget description and use of funds). We anticipate
funding 4-6 awards, typically valued at $2000- $3000.
Please send proposals to the ASN Regional Soci-
ety Liaison Committee Chair Rebecca Kimball (rkim-
ball@u.edu) by Feb. 15.

Call for Papers
MaleCompetitionSpeciation
CurrentZoology
We are excited to solicit papers on male competition
and speciation for a special column in an upcoming issue
of Current Zoology. Please feel free to contact any of
the guest editors with inquiries.
SPECIAL COLUMN: Male Competition and Speciation
(https://academic.oup.com/cz/pages/malecompetition)
GUEST EDITORS: Alycia Lackey (aly-
cia.reynolds@gmail.com), Michael Martin ( md-
martin7@gmail.com), and Robin Tinghitella
(Robin.Tinghitella@du.edu)
DESCRIPTION: Despite our long-standing pursuit
to understand the evolution and maintenance of new
species, we still lack a clear understanding of mecha-
nisms of speciation. Speciation remains an importantFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 85
focus due to its role in the evolution and maintenance
of biodiversity; this is particularly critical given current
and predicted global change and loss of biodiversity.
Sexual selection is a powerful source of rapid evolu-
tionary change, and there is a long-standing hypothesis
that it can cause reproductive isolation (i.e., when male
mating signals and female preferences for those signals
diversify). However, this understanding of speciation
by sexual selection is largely limited to sexual selection
via female mate choice. Male competition for mates,
Darwin's second mechanism of sexual selection, can
also favor rapid and dramatic phenotypic and genotypic
changes, yet it has been all but overlooked in speciation
research.
This special column will address when and how male
competition can generate or maintain population or
species dierences. The aims of this special column are
to: 1) expand our current speciation framework to in-
clude the contribution of male competition to speciation
by sexual selection 2) examine the importance of male
competition at dierent stages of divergence (e.g., within
populations, between diverging populations, between
distinct species) 3) explore the diversity of mechanisms
by which male competition drives divergence 4) motivate
future work by identifying unanswered questions

Freshwater Diatoms rbcLa gene
Dear list members,
I am a PhD student in New Zealand studying freshwater
ecology. I am interested in surveying diatom species
richness using the rbcLa gene region. I was wondering
if anyone had any suggestions for which primers to use
for amplication of this region. I have found a number
of primers published in the literature, but it does not
seem like there is a \standard".
Any help is much appreciated, and I am happy to com-

Instagram Course
Subject line: New class - Boost your science with Insta-
gram
Dear colleagues, Instagram can be a powerful social me-
dia tool for scientists. When used eectively, Instagram
can advance research careers and further outreach goals.
Unfortunately, very few researchers receive any training
on how to use Instagram for professional purposes.
That's where SciFund Challenge, an outreach-focused
nonprot, comes in with our new class: Using Instagram
to Boost Your Science. Over three weeks, you'll learn
how to use Instagram to further your science. Addi-
tionally, since Instagram is focused on photos, we'll also
teach you how to create better images. Even better,
by the end of the class, you'll have created a personal
Instagram plan to further your research or outreach
goals.
This class is being taught in partnership with the
Louisiana State University's College of Science and
Communication across the Curriculum program. The
class will be running for three weeks, from January 27-
February 17, 2017. The class is intended for academics
that are new to Instagram and it is open to academics
at any level, in any discipline. The class will be online,
so all countries are welcome.
he deadline to apply is January 26th, but our classes usu-
ally ll up early. Act soon if you are interested! Here's

Low Recombination
Request: information on species with low levels of re-
combination
Dear all,
We are currently conducting a review of species with
low levels of genome-wide recombination. Apart fromspecies in which one sex does not recombine and with
the exception of some specic chromosomes with zero
recombination (e.g., dot chromosomes in Drosophila),
most species appear to undergo at least one crossover
per chromosome pair and meiosis. We would be very
grateful for any hints on species, in which this is not
the case, that is, species with chromosomes that are less
than 50cM of total genetic length (if such species exist)
or, equivalently, that undergo less than one crossover
per meiosis. An alternative would be species, in which
crossovers occur exclusively at the ends of the chro-
mosomes, and hence with low levels of recombination
within chromosomes.
With best wishes and many thanks for any help oered,
Christoph Haag and Thomas Lenormand

PeerCommunity in
EvolutionaryBiology
Dear Evoldir members,
We are pleased to announce the launch of the Peer
Community in Evolutionary Biology (PCI Evol Biol)
website: https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org . This
website will host free, open and transparent reviews and
recommendations of preprint (i.e. prereview) articles
deposited in open archives, such as bioRxiv (biorxiv.org)
as well as recommendations of postprint (i.e. reviewed)
articles. Several recommendations for postprint articles
are already available on the home page of the website.
We warmly invite you to submit your preprint articles
to PCI Evol Biol for evaluation and recommendation
by this community.
PCI Evol Biol is currently supported
by more than 160 researchers (evol-
biol.peercommunityin.org/public/recommenders)
and we expect to be joined by many more.
Details about the aims, structure and functioning of
PCI Evol Biol can be found on the websitehelp page
(evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/about/help generic).
Briey, PCI Evol Biol is the rst community of the par-
ent project Peer Community In (peercommunityin.org).
The Peer Community In project is driven by a desire to
establish a high-quality, free, public system for identi-
fying high-quality articles through specic recommen-
dations recognized initially within, and subsequently
beyond the community, including by funding and re-
search agencies. This recommendation system will oer
a free alternative to all those uncomfortable with the cur-
rent evaluation and editing process of scientic journals,
which is very costly for research institutions.
Using PCI Evol Biol as an example, we will call for the es-
tablishment of other specic communities of researchers
(e.g. PCI Ecology, PCI Entomology) reviewing and
recommending articles in their elds. In the long term,
this project could, therefore, lead to the development
of an entirely new system of scientic publication, in
which articles are deposited in free open archives, and,
if appropriate, are reviewed and awarded a recommen-
dation providing a public guarantee of their scientic
quality.We hope you will appreciate this project and will pro-
vide it with your support, by submitting preprints of
high quality. Please tell your colleagues all about PCI
Evol Biol and its website.

Kuruman River Reserve, in the South African Kalahari
Desert.
My research, investigates the causes of individual vari-
ation in cooperative behaviour. I am particularly in-
terested in whether and how varied social experiences
throughout life can generate dierences in development
and behavioural prole. Further information about the
experiments will be provided on interview.
I am looking for applicants available for a period of 6
to 12 months starting as soon as possible. Applicants
should be hardworking, enthusiastic, physically t, and
prepared for long hours in the laboratory. Successful
applicants will be responsible to run experiments and

Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis).
We are looking for voluntary research assistants to help
with our research on the completely subterranean, highly
social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) in
the Kalahari. Starting between March and July 2017
for 6 months
Position 1: Behaviour and Physiology - mainly labora-
tory based
This position entails assisting in several studies on social
evolution and hormonal eects on social behaviour of
mole-rats. We are interested in the eects of hormonal
variation on allo-parental care and the eects variation
in the social environment on behaviour and physiology in
mole-rats. The research assistant will be involved in all
steps of the experiments and will mainly work in the lab-
oratory with our captive mole-rats which are housed in
large semi-natural tunnel systems. The responsibilities
include behavioural observations, hormonal measures
(blood sampling, urine sampling), obtaining morpholog-
ical measures by X-Ray, and hormonal manipulations.
The laboratory is situated in the Kuruman River Re-
serve in the southern Kalahari, Northern Cape province
of South Africa.
The successful applicant will work in a team of 5-10
persons and will receive extensive training to acquire
the skills needed for the above mentioned data collec-
tion. The research station is also the home of sev-
eral other projects studying meerkats (www.kalahari-
meerkats.com), cape ground squirrels, pied babblers,
forktailed drongos and hornbills resulting in a stimu-
lating scientic environment. Around 20-30 research
assistants are based at the station year round. Research
assistants will learn a range of skills such as remote
sensing of behaviour, endocrine sampling techniques, be-
havioural observations, data handling and management.
Applicants should be enthusiastic, willing to work hard
and keen to get involved in a research project in a remote
location.Position 2: Ecology - mainly eld based
We are conducting a capture-mark and recapture study
in which the voluntary research assistant can play an im-
portant role. Entire groups of mole-rats will be captured
and individually marked. Morphological measurements
and tissue samples will be obtained before the release
of the animals. The eld work is physically demanding
(long hours, heavy digging to capture mole-rats) and
weather conditions are very challenging (heat during the
day, very cold during the night). Field work will make
trapping during the night necessary. The assistant will
mostly be working along one more experienced scientist
but will need to work independently at times. This po-
sition requires working in a very small team in a remote
location on free ranging animals and the trapping season
will last for 3 months (starting in March or April 2017)
In both positions accommodation is provided, and re-
search assistants are paid a monthly allowance to cover
their personal costs and food. Domestic travel to the
eld site can be covered but we cannot provide an in-
ternational airfare, travel insurance, or visa fees for
applicants from overseas.

additional eld research experience before doing so. Re-
search will take place in semi-remote areas of Trinidad
sometimes under bad weather conditions. Applicants
must be able to live and work well with others. Research
will involve carrying heavy packs over slippery and steep
terrain. Applicants must be in good physical condition
and be able to meet the demands of eld research under
these conditions. Ability to drive a standard transmis-
sion vehicle is desirable but not required. Applicants
with rst-aid/rst responder training, skills in auto-
mobile maintenance, and construction skills are highly
desirable. Please address these skills when applying.
Interns will be required to spend a minimum of 3-months
in Trinidad, with possibility of extension. Starting dates
are as early as May 2017. We will cover all travel and
living expenses and provide housing.

UOxford VolResAssist Seabirds
Voluntary research assistantship in seabird behaviour &
ecology Skomer Island & University of Oxford
We are looking for an enthusiastic, hardworking young
biologist to work as a voluntary Research Assistant to
help with our pelagic seabird research on Skomer Island,
Pembrokeshire, Wales, in Spring and Summer 2017. The
work will involve several research projects coordinated
by Prof Tim Guilford at Oxford's Department of Zo-
ology (see the OxNav website). We utilise state-of-the
art tracking technologies (miniature GPS, geolocators,
time-depth recorders, etc) on several species of seabirds
but mainly on Manx shearwaters. Most work will in-
volve assisting doctoral students with the day-to-day
monitoring of breeding birds and with deploying and
retrieving tracking devices. It will also involve entering
data collected in the eld into appropriate databases.
There will be a signicant amount of nocturnal work,
since the primary study species is the Manx Shearwater,
which only arrives at the colony after dark. The role will
also involve monitoring Atlantic puns tracked with
geolocators and helping with their recapture (with some
work to be carried out at dawn) as part of a project led
by Dr Annette Fayet.
Unfortunately we cannot provide a stipend but (shared
and basic) accommodation on Skomer will be provided.
However, the project is a great opportunity to gain
valuable experience in modern eld ornithology. There
will also be opportunities for the assistant to learn some
analytical techniques applied to animal movement data.
Skomer has mobile coverage and some access to Inter-
net, however movements to and from the mainland are
limited due to unpredictable wind conditions. There is a
small community of wardens, assistants and volunteers,
who are involved in the running and conservation of
the Nature Reserve, monitoring the seabird populations,
and managing the daily and over-night visitors. There
might be opportunities to visit other UK island reservesFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 97
during the project. There will also be scope for involve-
ment in other conservation and ecological projects on the
island, which is a National Nature Reserve administered
by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.
Prole: we are looking for a motivated and hardworking
biologist, who likes working in the eld and can cope
with dicult working and living conditions, and who can
work with us between April and September 2017 (with
some exibility for the start and end dates). Previous
experience in the eld or in harsh conditions is desirable,
but not essential. Work on Skomer requires long hours
(with some work at night and at dawn) spent in a cold
and wet environment and considerable manual work. A
good candidate should be able to work independently
and have a reasonable level of tness. Planning to em-
bark on further research degrees in the future would be a
plus (previous assistants have engaged in doctoral stud-
ies afterwards). It is also important that the assistant
feels comfortable sharing sometimes crowded accommo-
dation with a number of colleagues over long periods
of time, and can cope with the occasional untidiness
inevitably associated with eldwork. Unfortunately, for
administrative reasons, we can only accept applications
from people having permission to work in the UK (UK
and EU citizens, UK residents, or persons with a UK
work permit).
How to apply: If you are interested, please
email a CV and a statement of interest, and
arrange for two letters of reference to be
emailed to tim.guilford@zoo.ox.ac.uk (with
oliver.padget@zoo.ox.ac.uk, james.evry@wadh.ox.ac.uk
and annette.fayet@zoo.ox.ac.uk in cc). Please note
that providing names of referees is not enough, the
candidate needs to arrange for their referees to email
us a reference (unfortunately we do not have time to
contact each referee individually). The deadline for
submitting applications (including reference letters) is
the 12th February 2017. We will interview the best
candidates on Skype shortly after and we expect to
make a decision by the end of February.

Big data are characterized not only by their size but
also by their heterogeneity and noisiness. These fea-

has been increasing exponentially with the advent of
new sequencing technologies, but also their complexity.
We aim at combining several available sources of infor-

but also, e.g., annotation features or metabolic path-
ways. An important goal is not only to provide ecient
predictors but also tools to biologically interpret the
results. We will explore machine learning tools such as
ensemble methods or deep learning to investigate two
main problems (i) genomic prediction, and (ii) inference
of selective sweeps.

Budapest CancerEvolution
A postdoctoral position is available to join the recently
established Evolutionary Genomics Research Group
funded in 2016 under a highly competitive 5 year grant
from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' \Momentum"
program as well as an ERC Starting Grant starting in
2017.
Research Topic:
Cancer is a genetic disease fuelled by somatic evolution.
Despite advances in the molecular biology of cancer
associated genes and the recent surge in the amount
of DNA sequences available for dierent cancers, our
understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that lead
to cancer is limited and cancer mortality rates have
changed little in the last few decades. Until we unravel
cancer's basic principles, the battle against it can only
progress in inches, rather than in miles.
To address the problems quantitatively, a new eld
called the \physics of cancer" has emerged. In the con-
text of this emerging eld the Evolutionary Genomics
Research Group works to understand the evolutionary
process that leads to the breakdown of the hierarchical
organisation of healthy tissues and the emergence of
tumours, using evolutionary models, computer simu-
lations, and sequence analysis. We do this with the
aim of developing models that can predict how cancers
respond to treatment depending on their functional and
genetic diversity and guide us toward developing novel
treatment strategies and improving existing ones. In our
most recent work (Der enyi & Sz oll ~Asi 2017) we asked
how tissues generate large numbers of cells while at the
seam time minimising the accumulation of mutations
and the risk of cancer.
To answer the question we introduced a general model of
hierarchically organised self-renewing tissue and derived
the lower limit of lifetime divisional load of a tissue.
We showed that hierarchically dierentiating tissues can
approach this limit, and that this depends on uneven
divisional rates across the hierarchy. We are looking for
a postdoctoral researcher to build on these results and
work with us in exploring the evolutionary process that
lead to breakdown of hierarchical organisation of healthy
tissues. The questions that we want to answer include:
Under what conditions do hierarchically dierentiated
tumours, i.e. \cancer stem cells", evolve? Which kind
of mutation lead to cancer and in what combination, e.g.do mutations that increase symmetric vs. asymmetric
cell division rate drive tumour progression or vice versa?

tion as a general mechanism to limit the accumulation

The successful candidate will either have a PhD in Evo-
lutionary or Computational Biology or come from a
strong quantitative background such as Physics, Ap-
plied Mathematics or Statistics with the ambition to
pursue research in Evolutionary Biology.
The position is for up to 2 years with the possibility of
extension and a salary of up to 2,000 EUR per month
conditional on experience (adjusting for cost of living
this corresponds to approx. EUR 3,000 in Berlin, 3,300

PolyploidEvolution
*Short-term postdoc position at the Department of
Botany, Faculty of Science, Charles University in the
working group of Population ecology* *(option for a
PhD position)*
*Consequences of polyploidization: from single traits to
population dynamics*
Understanding the consequences of polyploidization is
a major step in the attempt to understand species di-
versication. The project addresses critical gaps in our
knowledge on the role of polyploidization in the genesis
and maintenance of plant diversity. It describes dier-
ences in single traits and population dynamics between
diploids, tetraploids and newly synthesized tetraploids
by using multiple species and comparing performance
of plants coming from dierent evolutionary lineages
(dened by their haplotype proles). The results will
allow the identication of general dierences between
tetraploids and diploids. It will be one of the rst studies
to compare i) dierent cytotypes from the same evolu-
tionary lineage with dierent lineages within the same
cytotype, ii) dierences between neo-polyploids (syn-
thetically created polyploids) and their established coun-
terparts and iii) full life cycles of diploids, tetraploids
and neo-tetraploids under natural conditions.
*We seek *a highly motivated independent postdoc in-
terested in the evolution of polyploids. The postdoc
will use the existing data of the team, analyze the data
and prepare publications. Ideas for new analytical ap-
proaches are most welcome. Candidates will be expected
to produce peer-reviewed publications in high impact
factor international journals based on these data and
present their results at an international conference. We
welcome candidates interested to start their indepen-
dent research projects within our group and stay with
us past the postdoc period. A PhD position within the
framework can also be discussed.
At the moment, we dispose of a large amount of data
waiting to be analyzed and published. Specically, we
have data on:
1) the dierence of natural diploids and natural and syn-
thetic tetraploids in photoprotective and antioxidative
enzymes. These data can be combined with data on
plant tness (a manuscript on the tness data alone isabout to be submitted). This is a unique opportunity
to study the eects of polyploidization without subse-
quent evolution and between population variation in the
enzyme production patterns.
2) seed damage in natural diploids and natural and
synthetic tetraploids and diploid ospring of synthetic
tetraploid mothers. These data come from a two-year
survey and can be combined with data on plant phenol-
ogy (repeated census per individual) and tness. This is
a unique opportunity to study the eects of polyploidiza-
tion without subsequent evolution but also to account
for colchicine eects in the second generation after the
treatment and for between population variation of seed
damage.
3) pollinator communities and a range of pollinator re-
lated traits e.g. phenology, nectar production, pollen
production from several diploid-polyploid pairs from
multiple populations studied in control conditions.
4) pairwise competitive interactions between dierent
cytotypes in two species using plants of dierent phylo-
genetic origin.
5) interactions of the same species in mixture of the two
cytotypes allowing to study the development of mixed
ploidy populations using material of dierent sources
cultivated under dierent soil conditions.
6) performance (tness related traits) of dierent cyto-
types belonging to dierent evolutionary lineages allow-
ing to study the relative importance of cytotype and
lineage for species performance.
*The applicant* will be selected based on their past
publication record, ideas on the subject and additional
skills. The successful applicant is expected to bring new
expertise to the group. We will also consider candidates
interested in pursuing a PhD within the project.
*Application and project duration.* The application is
opened until being lled. The postdoc position is for a
maximum of 9 months and has to nish by December
31st 2017. The position may be prolonged by applica-
tion for a subsequent project. Conditions for the PhD.
will be explained individually.
*We oer* a young, friendly, working group broadly
interested in plant population biology and genetics with
many PhD and Master students involved in the research,
a competitive salary (by Central European standards)
and freedom to direct your work according to your inter-
ests within the broad topic of our research. Candidates
will enjoy working in a collaborative team but must be
highly self-motivated and work well independently.
*Location.* The post-doc will be primarily based
at the Charles University in the center of Prague102 EvolDir February 1, 2017
(www.natur.cuni.cz). It will, however, be partly as-
sociated with the Botanical Institute situated in a large

Paris SimilarityNetworks
Dear colleagues, Please nd below the description of
a postdoctoral position in statistics and evolution to
\improve the comparative framework based on simi-
larity networks". The EVOLUNET project, funded
by the ERC, is enhancing the use of similarity net-
works, adapted to evolutionary biology questions (http:/-
/www.evol-net.fr/index.php/fr/evolunet). Such net-works, inspired by the studies on social and regulatory
networks, allow mainly for fast inclusive comparative
analyses of both (highly) divergent and conserved molec-
ular sequences from living organisms, mobile genetic
elements, that were obtained either from lab cultures
or from environmental samples, or both. These net-
works allow in particular to detect chimeric genes (i.e.
genes made of parts with dierent evolutionary histo-
ries) and therefore to investigate the evolution of genes;
and to detect lateral gene transfer, and therefore to
investigate the evolution of genomes and microbial com-
munities. Moreover, similarity networks also allow to
compare diverse data, gathered by experts from dif-
ferent evolutionary elds, such as historical linguistics
and paleontology. The EVOLUNET project already
implemented various methods and applied them to dif-
ferent evolutionary questions. Now, network comparison
becomes the next important development for network
analyses. In particular, network comparison should be
most useful to test whether dierent similarity networks
(i.e. constructed from samples from dierent locations
and/or dierent time periods) have resulted from similar
(or from distinct) evolutionary processes. To further
develop network comparisons, especially networks of
sequences from environmental microbiomes, our lab is
now looking for a post-doctoral fellow in bio-informatics,
graph theory or evolutionary biology with a strong back-
ground in programming, who will be funded for up to
2 years by an ERC grant (for an approximate salary of
2,727 euros/ month before taxes). The candidate will
take advantage of the properties of many of the real-life
networks constructed in the lab, of our original micro-
biome data, and of algorithms from network sciences for:
-1) Developing and comparing network-based diversity
indices -2) Constituting a comparative framework be-
tween real-life sequence similarity networks and sequence
similarity networks generated based on various models
of sequence evolution The rst task implies exploring
various network-based diversity measures to compare
labelled weighted networks that harbor millions of nodes
and dozens of millions of edges. Such networks are often
too large to be directly compared by graph matching
algorithms. However, they contain precious information
regarding genetic diversity of the investigated datasets.
While diversity measures have been developed for phy-
logenetic trees or phylogenetic networks, sequence simi-
larity networks provide an additional kind of distances
among biological objects (sequences, genomes, environ-
ments) that can be investigated taking advantages of
the network topological properties, and therefore the
comparison of similarity networks should provide new
insights about the evolution of genetic diversity.
The second task relies upon descriptions of large net-February 1, 2017 EvolDir 109
works by various topological indices (diameter, cluster-
ing, distribution of motifs of a given size, ...) and by
the diversity indices considered above. These descrip-
tions will be used to test whether two networks exhibit
the same properties or not. The postdoctoral fellow
will rst test if real-life similarity networks share the
same properties as networks generated from sequences
evolved under a given model to determine whether the
data t that particular model. Such comparisons will
help the postdoctoral fellow to determine what a real-life
network properties usually are, and thus help him/her
build better null model similarity networks, specically
designed for evolutionary studies (as opposed to the ran-
dom networks often used in the graph literature that do
not always t the properties of real-life networks). The
postdoctoral fellow will also develop test statistics to
compare the topological and diversity indices of real-life
similarity networks with those of carefully simulated
networks. Such statistics will allow classifying genes
and proteins into sets that show a diversity that can
be relatively simply explained (e.g. displaying indices
compatible with known processes and evolutionary mod-
els), or require other explanations (e.g. surprisingly
extremes rates of divergence, fusion, or recombination).
Ultimately, the postdoctoral fellow will determine which
simulated networks best t with real-life networks and
develop a random graph model specically designed for
evolutionary studies, so that this model might be further
exploited by

A postdoctoral position is available study the genetic ba-
sis of adaptation in native populations of the model plant
Arabidopsis thaliana. This research is part of a NSF
funded collaborative project on the genetic basis of t-
ness tradeos across environments, focusing on freezing
tolerance as a key adaptive trait. We use a combination
of eld experiments in the native environments, experi-
ments in controlled growth chambers, and -omic data to
investigate, across environments, the links between geno-
type, phenotype, and tness. Additional research in thelab is focused on the evolutionary ecology and genetic
basis of heterosis and outbreeding depression in Ara-
bidopsis. Resources available in the lab include a large
collection of lines from natural A. thaliana populations
spanning latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, recombi-
nant inbred lines and near isogenic line populations for
genetic mapping, and engineered lines (transgenic and
CRISPR-CAS9) for candidate genes. Development of
new research directions building on these themes and
resources is encouraged.
Research activities will include (but are not limited to):
Leading growth chamber experiments to estimate freez-
ing tolerance, lifetime tness, and patterns of global
gene expression; eld planting and harvesting of ex-
periments at sites in Italy (near Rome) and northern
Sweden (three to four trips per year, ~10 days each);
overseeing development of near isogenic lines (for ne
mapping), and the production and genotyping of two
new recombinant inbred line populations; data analysis;
and manuscript preparation.
A PhD in biology or related discipline is required and
preference will be given to candidates with a strong
background in plant evolutionary biology. Previous ex-
perience with the analysis of genomic data is strongly
preferred. This is initially a one-year appointment, with

We are looking for a highly motivated person that will
work within a newly started project focused on climate-
adapted poplars (Populus spp.) for Swedish and Baltic
regions (CLAP, https://www.slu.se/clap). The postdoc
(24 months xed term employment) will do work in
association genetics and quantitative genetics to study
the genetic architecture of phenology traits as bud burst,
bud set and growth cessation with the overall aim to110 EvolDir February 1, 2017
develop molecular markers for breeding poplars vari-
eties for use at northern latitudes. The applicant will
conduct work in the lab, in the eld and use genomic
and phenotypic data for dierent types of quantitative
genetic analyses.
Successful candidates will have a PhD degree in genetics
or equivalent eld. As postdoctoral appointments are
career-developing positions for junior researchers, we
are primarily looking for candidates with a doctoral
degree that is three years old at most. The candidate
should have proven expertise in genetics and be used
to handle large genomic and/or phenotypic datasets.
Prior experience of working with computational and/or
statistical analyses in a quantitative genetics framework
is thus highly desirable. Excellent prociency in English
is required, as English is the working language in the
research group. A driving license is preferable, as the
work will involve some eldwork in remote areas. The
project involves working within a larger research team
of around ten researchers, so candidates should have
an easy time working with others but also the ability
to work independently with your own research topics.
Creativity and drive are personal characteristics that
are desirable due to the knowledge-driven aspect of the
project. The PhD position is housed at the Department
of Plant Biology, Swedish University of Agricultural
Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.

Description
A NSF-funded postdoctoral scholar position is immedi-
ately available in the laboratory of Dr. Adriana Briscoe
at University of California, Irvine. Research in the
Briscoe lab is aimed at understanding the molecular
basis of color vision evolution in butteries. The lab
has recently developed a new method for expressing
invertebrate rhodopsins at levels suitable for functional
characterization of rhodopsin absorption spectra (see
Frentiu et al. 2015 Molecular Biology and Evolution).
The lab is seeking a postdoctoral scholar who will extend
this method to develop further insights into the molecu-
lar basis of spectral tuning, a form of adaptation to the
light environment. To accomplish this, the postdoctoral
researcher will use homology modeling, western blot
analysis, and functional expression of opsins in HEK293
cells to identify the amino acid residues responsible for
the tuning of buttery rhodopsins across an adaptive
radiation.
Successful candidates will collaborate with a dynamic
team of behaviorists, electrophysiologists, and evolution-
ary biologists at UC Irvine and other institutions.
Required qualications include a Ph.D. in molecular bi-
ology, biochemistry, or related elds and demonstrated
prociency with cell culture, western blot analysis, and
immunoanity purication. Desirable qualications in-114 EvolDir February 1, 2017
clude expertise in immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and
DNA sequence analysis; a strong publication record and
excellent writing/communication skills.

The postdoc will primarily work with phylogeography
and evolutionary genetics of a range of tree species grow-
ing in the Caspian forest of northern Iran. The forests
contain tree species which are also indigenous in Europe
- for example beech, ash, oak, maple, lime, wild cherry,
elm and hornbeam. The Caspian forests date back tobefore the Pleistocene, i.e. more than 2.6 million years,
and have thus existed continuously during all the glacial
and interglacial periods in the current ice age. The
overall project, to which the postdoc will be aliated,
aims to test to which extend the Caspian forests in Iran
contain genetic potential for our European forests and
their ability to adapt to future challenges in terms of
climate change, new diseases and pests. This will imply
establishment of eld trials in Denmark and Iran with
Iranian provenances and the following 6 species have
been selected as study objects: 1) Fagus sylvatica subsp.
orientalis, 2) Fraxinus excelsior, 3) Acer velutinum, 4)
Quercus castaneifolia, 5) Carpinus betulus and 6) Alnus
subcordata. The project includes a DNA work pack-
age, which will study the population genetic structure
and evolutionary genetics of the selected species in Iran
and compare genetic diversity between the Caspian and
Danish/European forests. This will be the main subject
for the post doc.
The ideal candidate may already have postdoctoral ex-
perience, and should have an expertise in one or ideally
several of the following areas: population and evolu-
tionary genetics, bioinformatics and handling of next-
generation-sequencing data, DNA-marker development,
phylogeny and forest genetics. The applicant should be
familiar with working in a molecular genetics lab as well
as be able to do independent eld work in remote areas
of Iran for periods of up to 1-2 months.

Project description Eects of climate change on ecologi-
cal communities are expected to be particularly strong at
northern latitudes. The collaborative project \Climate
change induced regime shifts in northern lake ecosys-
tems" addresses two major, climate-dependent drivers
of northern lakes: (i) altered thermal regimes, and (ii)
increased input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter
(tDOM). In a series of interconnected work packages
we will use experimental, comparative, paleo-ecological,environmental genomics and modeling approaches to
study the impact of temperature and tDOM on ecosys-
tem processes ranging from primary production and
greenhouse gas dynamics to sh production and food
web dynamics. We expect responses to these drivers to
be highly nonlinear.

PhyloComparativeMethods
Postdoctoral Position at the University of Minnesota,
Twin Cities
A postdoctoral researcher is sought to develop phyloge-
netic comparative methods and apply them to stud-
ies of plant macroevolution. This project is a col-
laboration between the labs of Emma Goldberg at
the University of Minnesota (where the position will
be based), Itay Mayrose at Tel Aviv University, and
Tracy Heath at Iowa State University. The post-
doc will additionally work closely with Heath Black-
mon at UMN, with a postdoc and software engineer
at TAU, and with graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents at UMN and TAU. More information about
our labs is available at <http://www.umn.edu/ ~eeg
>,<http://www.tau.ac.il/ ~itaymay>,<http://-
phyloworks.org >, and<http://coleoguy.github.io >.
The work will focus on improving and applying phylo-
genetic methods for testing the inuence of traits on
lineage diversication. One line of attack is develop-
ing new model-based phylogenetic comparative methods,
targeting known weaknesses in existing approaches. The
other is creating tools for more robust testing, to stabi-
lize the use of existing and future methods; this includes
designing benchmark test suites and tests of model ad-
equacy. For all topics, the goal is to create products
that are intellectually stimulating and practically useful,
and to facilitate their adoption by the broader commu-
nity. Empirical work will make use of extensive datasets
on plant reproductive systems and chromosome counts,
and it has the potential to make one of the strongest
cases yet for the importance of species selection. The
postdoc will also contribute to new workshops teaching
phylogenetic comparative methods, to be held in the
Midwest US and in Israel.
Relevant skills and knowledge include: macroevolution
of reproductive systems and genome structure; phyloge-
netic comparative methods use and development; math-
ematics of stochastic processes; computational statistics;
database and user interface design; programming in R,
RevBayes, and C++; software tools for reproducible re-
search workows; writing clearly for both technical and
general readers; and teaching in a computer lab setting.
Expertise is not required in all these areas, however!
We are generally looking for a biologist with macroevo-lutionary interests and technical problem-solving skills.
Initial appointment will be for one year with competitive
salary (compliant with FLSA) and benets. Renewal
for up to two more years is possible, pending excellent
performance and mutual agreement. The start date
is exible. To apply, please assemble (i) a 1-3 page
cover letter that highlights how your research inter-
ests and skills t with this project, (ii) a CV, and (iii)
names and contact information for three professional
references. Materials should be submitted online at
<http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/employment/ >(Job Id

UWarwick AncientPathogens
4 Year Research Fellow in Ancient Pathogen Statistical
Genomics (78464-117), Warwick Medical School, Uni-
versity of Warwick (Closing 15th February 2017)
This four-year fellowship will focus on the development
of novel statistical tools and analysis pipelines for an-
cient DNA metagenomes. The post is associated with
a ve year, 2M Wellcome Trust Investigator award
to determine: How old are bacterial pathogens, and
what evolutionary steps have they undergone? The re-
search fellow will address these key questions through
the analysis of hundreds of ancient metagenomes gener-
ated from human associated fossils during this project.
Statistical problems to be addressed include: infer-
ence of ancient transmission dynamics between dierent
hosts and geographical areas, de novo reconstruction
of pathogen genomes and abundances directly from
metagenomes, applications of the fossilised-birth-death
process to improve placement of ancient pathogens on
ancestral branches within time calibrated phylogenies
and applications of Bayesian non-parametrics to incor-porate time varying rates of evolution into phylogenies.
It will be co-supervised by an international team of ex-
perts headed by Prof Achtman (WMS). This will consist
of Dr Christopher Quince (WMS - metagenomics), Prof
Tanja Stadler (ETH Zurich - computational evolution)
and Prof Philippe Lemey (KU Leuven - Bayesian phylo-
genetics). The ideal candidate will have a background
in statistics or computational biology or a related quan-
titative discipline such as theoretical physics. Expertise
in quantitative data analysis is essential as is either
theoretical or applied experience, as evidenced by high
quality publications, in at least one of the following
areas: phylogenetic inference, metagenomics, statisti-
cal genomics, stochastic processes and Bayesian non-
parametrics. The closing date for applications is the
15th February 2017 for a start date of 1st March 2017
although later starts are possible. Applications should
be through the University of Warwick website job id

THREE YEAR POSTDOC POSITION IN STATISTI-
CAL GENOMICS
The postdoctoral position will be part of a joint
project between the groups of Carolin Kosiol
(University of St. Andrews / Vetmeduni Vienna,
https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/population-genetics/-
research/research-groups/kosiol-lab/ ), Gergely Sz oll osi
(Etv os University Budapest, http://ssolo.web.elte.hu/-
), Asger Hobolth (Aarhus University, http://-
www.daimi.au.dk/ ~asger/). The recent sequencing
of genomes of closely related species and of many
individuals from the same species enables the study
of speciation and the inference of the history of
populations. Standard phylogenetic methods reduce
entire populations to single points in genotypic space
by modelling evolution as a process in which a single
gene mutates along the branches of a phylogeny.
Recently, we have developed new approaches that
allow the inclusion of population genetics such as the
Wright-Fisher model (Tataru et al, Syst Biol 2016;
Hobolth, JTB 2015), that are polymorphism-aware
phylogenetic models (PoMo, Schrempf et al., JTB
2016, DeMaio et al., Syst Biol 2015) , and model gene
duplication transfer and loss (DTL, Sz oll osi et al., SystFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 123
Biol 2015; Scornavacca et al., Bioinformatics 2015) for
species tree estimation. We envisage developing new
theory and software to tackle the problem of species
tree estimation and molecular dating genome-wide.
Applications will include mammalian genomes to study
the Cambrian explosion as well as contributions to
international genome consortia.
The postdoc will be based in Vienna. Visits to Budapest
and Aarhus for close collaboration are planned. The
project is funded for three years by Wiener Technology
and Science Fund (WWTF) through the \Maths and
.." Call ( http://www.wwtf.at/programmes/ma/ ). It
also includes a PhD student and a programmer position
that will be advertised separately.
Candidates will be expected to have completed a PhD in
Computational Biology, Mathematics, Statistics, Com-
puter Science or a related eld. Prior experience witheither phylogeny, population genetics or comparative
genomics is essential. Preferably the candidate will have
experience in C or C++ and a scripting language such
as Python or Perl.
The position will be hosted by the Institute of Popu-
lation Genetics at the Vetmeduni Vienna. Vienna has
developed into an international center in evolutionary bi-
ology (http://www.evolvienna.at, http://www.popgen-
vienna.at/ ). In addition to a stimulating scientic
environment, Vienna is also a quite liveable city with af-
fordable housing, good public transport and an exciting
cultural life.

May29-June2
Data analysis in high throughput biology https://-
www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course3/ >From the
29th of May to the 2nd of June 2017 in Berlin, Germany
(https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course3/).
Instructor: Dr. January Weiner (Max Planck In-
stitute for Infection Biology; https://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t14/).
Course overview
High throughput (HT) techniques such as transcrip-
tomics or metabolomics are of great signicance in many
areas of biology. With the standard techniques becoming
more aordable and new techniques being introduced
all the time, the amount of data sets generated is stag-
gering. However, statistical and computational analysis
of HT data sets present many challenges. In this course,
the students will gain the ability to independently pro-
cess and analyse HT data sets, select the appropriate
tools, functionally interpret the results as well as learn
the paradigms of computational biology and statistics
which will allow them to eciently communicate with
computational biologists.
Intended audience
In general, the course is aimed at biologists who would
like to take their data analysis in their own hands. While
an aptitude for computational work is necessary, the
main goal of the course is the application of biological
and statistical knowledge to HT sets with as little eort
as necessary.February 1, 2017 EvolDir 125
* basic computer skills (a rudimentary knowledge of pro-
gramming principles in any language is recommended,
but not mandatory) * basic understanding of statis-
tics * basic understanding of molecular techniques for
generating high throughput data
The students should be comfortable with using a com-
puter and have at least a rudimentary understanding of
computer programming. However, no specic skills are
necessary; the students will learn basic R programming
in this course.
Basic skills in statistics are necessary. The students
should understand the concepts of statistical hypothesis
testing and p-values. However, an in-depth introduction
to these concepts will also be provided.
Target student skills
* overview of commonly used high-throughput data types
* techniques for data clean-up and preparation for anal-
ysis * understanding of computational problems associ-
ated with high- throughput data analysis * statistical
problems and solutions in analysis of HT data * practical
skills in analysis methods of HT data: - basic dierential
analysis (limma, DESeq, alternative and non- paramet-
ric techniques) - set enrichment techniques (GSEA, gene
ontologies, metabolic proling and more) - multivariate
approaches to data analysis (PCA / ICA, PLS, multiple
correspondance analysis) - basic approaches in machine
learning: cross * Communication skills in statistics and
computational biology
After the course, the student should be able to pre-
pare, analyse and interpret a HT data set, including
multivariate and machine learning techniques.
Teaching format
On each day, the course will consist of four parts:
* Lecture: theoretical introduction to the days focus *
Hands-on guide: guided practical session in R where
students replicate the analysis performed by the teacher.
While the lecture is general, here specic R techniques
and R packages are introduced * Guided self-study: stu-
dents are given excercises and problems to solve and
work on them individually under the guidance of the
teacher * Individual project work: each student will
receive a transcriptomic (RNASeq or microarray) data
set to analyse throughout the course * Lecture: wrap-up
and side notes; preparation for the following day

Berlin DatavizWithPython
March13-17
Dear all,
we still have a few places available (rst come, rst
served) for the \Data Manipulation and VIsualization
with Python" Workshop, 13-17 March 2017 in Berlin
(Germany) http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/-
course10/ Application deadline:
February 24th 2017.
Instructor:
Dr Martin Jones (Founder, Python for Biologists
http://pythonforbiologists.com ) http://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t1/ Course overview:
One of the strengths of the Python language is the avail-
ability of mature, high-quality libraries for working with
scientic data. Integration between the most popular
libraries has led to the concept of a \scientic Python
stack": a collection of packages which are designed to
work well together. In this workshop we will see how126 EvolDir February 1, 2017
to leverage these libraries to eciently work with and
visualize large volumes of data.
Workshop format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at
the organizer's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
The last two sessions will be kept free for students to
work on their own datasets with the assistance of the
instructor. A description of the sessions can be found
at the bottom of this page.
Who should attend:
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers who are dealing with large datasets and don't
know how to investigate them to make publishable
graphics.
Requirements:
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the example datasets. They
should also have some basic Python experience (the
Introduction to Python course will fulll these require-
ments). Students should be familiar with the use of
lists, loops, functions and conditions in Python and
have written at least a few small programs from scratch.
Students will require the scientic Python stack to be
installed on their laptops before attending; instructions
for this will be sent out prior to the course.

Curriculum
Monday 13th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1 - Introduction and datasets
Jupyter (formerly iPython) is a programming environ-
ment that is rapidly becoming the de facto standard for
scientic data analysis. In this session we'll learn why
Jupyter is so useful, covering its ability to mix notes and
code, to render inline plots, charts and tables, to use
custom styles and to create polished web pages. We'll
also take a look at the datasets that we'll be investigat-
ing during the course and discuss the dierent types of
data we encounter in bioinformatics work.
Session 2 - Introduction to pandas
In this session we introduce the rst part of the sci-
entic Python stack: the pandas data manipulationpackage. We'll learn about Dataframes the core data
structure that much of the rest of the course will rely on
and how they allow us to quickly select, sort, lter and
summarize large datasets. We'll also see how to extend
existing Dataframes by writing functions to create new
columns, as well as how to deal with common problems
like missing or inconsistent values in datasets. We'll
get our rst look at data visualization by using pandas'
built in plotting ability to investigate basic properties
of our datasets.
Tuesday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3- Grouping and pivoting with pandas
This session continues our look at pandas with advanced
uses of Dataframes that allow us to answer more com-
plicated questions. We'll look two very powerful tools:
grouping, which allows us to aggregate information in
datasets, and pivoting/stacking, which allows us to ex-
ibly rearrange data (a key step in preparing datasets
for visualization). In this session we'll also go into more
detail about pandas indexing system.
Session 4- Advanced manipulation with pandas
In this nal session on the pandas library we'll look at
a few common types of data manipulation binning data
(very useful for working with time series), carrying out
principal component analysis, and creating networks.
We'll also cover some features of pandas designed for
working with specic types of data like timestamps and
ordered categories.
Wednesday 15th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 5-Introduction to seaborn
This session introduces the seaborn charting library by
showing how we can use it to investigate relationships
between dierent variables in our datasets. Initially we
concentrate on showing distributions

Berlin LinuxForBiologists
July31-Aug4
Dear all,February 1, 2017 EvolDir 127
We are happy to announce that we will be holding the
second edition of the \Introduction to Linux and work-
ows for biologists" in Berlin (Germany) from the 31th
July to the 4th August 2017.
Instructor:
Dr Martin Jones (Founder, Python for Biologists
http://pythonforbiologists.com ) http://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t1/ Overview
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lifting
genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation tools
are designed to work best when used with a command-
line interface. Because the command line can be an
intimidating environment, many biologists learn the
bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools work-
ing. This means that they miss out on the power of
Linux to customize their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.
Intended audience
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology who want to learn
to use the Linux operating system and the command
line environment. No previous experience of Linux is
required.

Berlin Metabarcoding Apr3-7
updated
Dear all,
here's an updated version of the syllabus for the \16S
rRNA gene Metabarcoding" workshop, 3-7 April 2017
in Berlin (Germany).
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course8/ In-
structor: Dr. Alexandre de Menezes (National
University of Ireland Galway) https://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t5/ Course overview
The 16s rRNA gene has become the standard marker for
prokaryote phylogenetic analysis, and combined with
high-throughput sequencing technologies it is widely
used to infer the structure and composition of microbial
communities. Due to the continuous improvements in
sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, there
is a wide choice of methods for sequencing and analysing
16S rRNA gene assemblies. This workshop is designed128 EvolDir February 1, 2017
to give students the necessary background and prac-
tical experience of the strategies for the analysis of
the diversity and structure of prokaryote communities,
covering i) experimental design and primer choices; ii)
wet-lab and library preparation options; iii) sequence
quality control and analysis and iv) statistical analysis
of microbial community data. The many sequencing
and analysis options will be discussed, whereas a more
in-depth tutorial using real sequence data will provide
an opportunity for the student to practice 16S rRNA
sequence analysis from raw sequence les to ecological
interpretation. Course material, such as presentation
slides and necessary model data, will be provided to the
students.
Targeted audience and assumed background
This workshop is intended for students and researchers
interested in microbial ecology but who are not yet very
familiar with the techniques involved. Choosing the ap-
propriate primers, library preparation kits, sequencing
methodologies and bioinformatics pipelines can be quite
daunting to the uninitiated. This workshop will allow
researchers interested more condence in their method-
ology and analyses choices. The target audience include
students of animal or plant microbiomes as well as those
studying environmental microbial communities. It is
assumed that the workshop attendees are interested in
performing 16S rRNA metabarcoding using the Illumina
MiSeq platform, although other sequencing technologies
will be discussed during the workshop.
Knowledge of Linux and R or familiarity with work-
ing in the command line will be helpful, but for those
new to the area detailed instructions will allow students
to follow the workshop. Students will need to have a
computer running either on Linux or a Linux virtual
machine running on MacOX/Windows computers. Con-
tact the instructor at ademez@gmail.com if in doubt
about computational requirements.
Workshop structure
The workshop will consist of both lectures and practical
classes. Background information will be provided to
help workshop attendees choose the appropriate experi-
mental design, primers, sequencing library preparation
kits and to contextualise the bioinformatics and sta-
tistical analysis methods. Practical tutorials will be
conducted on a step-by-step basis to guide the student
from when receiving data from a sequence provider to ob-
taining plots and tables describing microbial community
diversity, structure and relationships to environmental
variables or host data.

Session contents
Monday 3rd-Classes from 10:00 to 18:00
Session 1: the 16S rRNA gene
The use of the 16S rRNA gene as a marker for prokary-
ote phylogenetics will be discussed to introduce the
students to the concept of conserved and hypervariable
regions. The student will learn about the history of this
molecular marker and why it is the choice for prokaryote
diversity studies. The primer combinations used to tar-
get the dierent hypervariable regions will be discussed,
as well as what is known regarding their advantages
and disadvantages. The pros and cons of PCR-based
16S rRNA gene sequencing versus PCR-free shot-gun
metagenomics will also be discussed.
This session will also include an overview of current se-
quencing technologies, and the Illumina MiSeq platform
will be contrasted with other sequencing technologies
(Ion Torrent, MinIon, PacBio and Moleculo).
Session 2: sequencing experimental design and initial
hands-on exercises
Focusing on the MiSeq platform, experimental design
considerations will be discussed and topics discussed
will include sequence depth, replication, contamination
and the use of appropriate controls and mock communi-
ties. Other topics that will be taught include: metadata
collection, DNA extraction and RNA-cDNA sequenc-
ing. Demo sequence data will be used to check that the
appropriate tools are installed correctly for subsequent
practical work, and students will perform exercises in

EVOLUTION OF SEX ROLES
Dear Colleagues
Glad to announce that our Wshop just launched a web-

See you soon in Tihany.
Best wishes, Tamas Szekely on behalf of the organisers
===WORKSHOP INVITATION SEX-ROLE EVOLU-
TION: INTEGRATING NEURAL, BEHAVIOURAL
AND PHYLOGENETIC APPROACHES
We are glad to invite you to our Workshop that will
take place between 6th April 2017 and 9th April 2017 in
Tihany, Hungary. The event will start with wine-tasting
on Thursday 6 April, will include 2 full days for research
talks by top scientists, post-docs and students, and
an optional excursion on Sunday to a hot spa (Heviz)
and/or the historic Festetics Palace in Keszthely.
Theoretical, experimental, phylogenetic, demographic
and neuro-genomic studies of sexual selection, mating
systems, pair-bonding, parenting and reproductive be-
haviours are rapidly advancing. The objectives of the
workshop are to overview recent developments in sex
roles and associated behaviours, and allow scientists
and students to develop new ideas. The Workshop
will take place at the guesthouse of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences at Lake Balaton. The guest-February 1, 2017 EvolDir 131
house oers a great venue for up to 60 participants,
see www.blki.hu/vendeghaz/index en.html Balaton is a
major tourist destination in Central Europe (see http:/-
/balaton.gotohungary.com/), and the Workshop will be
before the peak tourist season; so we'll have all the
scenery, folklore and tradition without the crowd. Bala-
ton is one of the best wine-growing regions in Hungary
famous for white wines including the Szurkebarat and
Juhfark.
The Workshop will focus on three main themes: (i) be-
havioural variations in sex roles and their ecological and
demographic causes, (ii) phylogenetic analyses of sex
role variations, and (iii) neuro-genomic regulation of sex
roles.
In each theme there will be seminars by invited speakers
and contributions by young scientists, post-docs and
PhD students. We will also discuss the future of sex
role research: what are the outstanding questions, what
techniques will need to be developed, and how should
the eld as such develop. The combination of dier-
ent research skills and variety of model organisms will
provide outstanding opportunities to synthesize major
research directions.

national guidelines for the monitoring of ve saprox-
ylic beetles species (Osmoderma eremita, Lucanus
cervus, Cerambyx cerdo, Rosalia alpina and Morimus
asper/funereus) listed in the Habitats Directive. One
innovative method tested is the use of a \molecular dog"
to detect Osmoderma eremita. The MIPP project is
also applying a citizen science approach for the map-
ping of rare insects in Italy: people collaborated with
scientists. The workshop is open to anyone interested in
entomology and in particular in: monitoring protocols,
conservation and management, habitats and biodiversity,

Course description
Study methods in population genomics have been pro-
foundly reshaped in the last few years thanks to the
growing availability of complete genomic sequences at
population level. The rapid and recent growth of data
and methods calls for new approaches to become routine
in evolutionary genomics laboratories. The objective ofthis EMBO Practical Course is to give an overview of
state of the art methods in population genomics combin-
ing lecturing from outstanding experienced population
geneticists and software developers. All conceptual in-
novation will be presented in lectures and applied in
practice both individually and in group work.
Practicals includes computer exercises supervised by
lecturers and training assistants. After attending the
course participants will be aware of up-to-date concepts
in population genetics, capable of running analyses us-
ing software based on whole genome data sequences
and able to deal with basic aspects of any population
genomics project. This EMBO Practical Course aims at
evolutionary biologists who already have bioinformatics
skills. PhD students and Post-Doc researchers will ben-
et the most out of this course, but applications from
all candidates will be evaluated in their context.

IntroductoryMolecPylogenetics
May8-12
Dear Colleagues,
The Natural History Museum, London and BBSRC are
oering a one-week introductory course ^A3Integrating
molecules with taxonomy and systematics: an introduc-
tory molecular phylogenetics course for species iden-
tication and evolutionary analysis ^A2, to run from
8-12th May 2017. The course will be taught by
NHM scientists and will benet anyone wishing to
gain expertise in molecular diagnostics and phylo-
genetic analysis for systematic, taxonomic and eco-
logical studies. Note that this course assumes no
prior experience with DNA sequence analyses and is
an introductory course. As such, it is not appro-
priate for more advanced students. More informa-
tion can be found here: http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-
science/courses-and-students/integrating-molecules -
with-taxonomy-and-systematics.html
Summary: This one-week introductory-level course will
teach participants the steps involved to produce molec-
ular phylogenies from raw Sanger and next-generation
sequence data (i.e. Illumina paired-end). A phylogeny is
essential for dening species boundaries, species identi-
cations, recognition of cryptic species, testing systematic
hypotheses, identifying evolutionary and biogeographic
patterns and understanding the evolution of traits. As
such, knowing how to produce a robust tree is an indis-
pensible tool for modern taxonomists, systematists and
evolutionary biologists. By the time the participants
have completed the course, they will have had theoreti-
cal and practical experience enabling them to i) edit raw
Sanger and NGS sequence data, ii) carry out multiple
sequence alignments, iii) choose appropriate models of
sequence evolution, iv) carry out phylogenetic analyses
(including Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood), v)
interpret tree topology and nodal support, vi) produce
publication ready trees, vii) work with public sequence
repositories, vii) assemble and annotate next generation
sequence data, and viii) recognise cryptic species.Venue and duration: The Natural History Museum,
London, UK. The course will run for one week, 9.30am-
6.00pm, 8-12th May 2017.
Eligibility and how to apply: The course is available to
anyone but please note that priority will be given to
applicants supported by BBSRC, working on a BBSRC
grant or based at a BBSRC institute. There are a max-
imum of 12 places available. The course is sponsored
by BBSRC and the NHM and we are charging only a
nominal fee of 300, which includes all course costs as
well as accommodation in London and some travel costs
within the UK. Lunch and light refreshments will be
provided each day. To apply please use the application

website: http://treethinkers.org/ Introduction Phyloge-
netic methods have revolutionized modern systematics
and become indispensable tools in evolution, ecology
and comparative biology, playing an increasingly impor-
tant role in analyses of biological data at all levels of
organization ranging from molecules to ecological com-
munities. The estimation of phylogenetic trees is now a
formalized statistical problem with general agreement
on the central issues and questions. A nearly standard
set of topics is now taught as part of the curriculum
at many colleges and universities. On the other hand,
application of phylogenetic methods to novel problems
outside systematics is an area of special excitement, in-
novation, and controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
This Spring, for the seventeenth year, we will teach a
workshop for graduate students interested in applying
phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The
one-week course is an intensive exploration of problems
to which modern phylogenetic approaches are being
applied and the most current statistical tools and ap-
proaches that are used to solve those problems. We cover
a wide range of topics in comparative phylogenetics. The
course starts with recent advances in phylogenetic infer-
ence, and then focuses on methods for making inferences
from phylogenies.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the beautiful Northern California coast, which
has on-site housing. The course format will involve equal
parts of lecture and hands-on software training (with
an emphasis on performing analyses using RevBayes:

ConservationGenomics
UCLA/La Kretz Workshop in Conservation Genomics,
25 - 29 March, 2017 Conservation biology, genetics, and
evolutionary biology have had a long and intimate re-
lationship, and conservation constitutes one of the key
applications of evolutionary analysis to real-world biolog-
ical problems. The impacts of population and landscape
genetics and gene expression studies have been particu-
larly striking, and are helping to solve some of the most
pressing problems in biological conservation.
As the eld of conservation genetics continues to grow
and mature, the availability of genome-scale data stand
to make profound new contributions to our ability to
identify and protect at-risk populations and recover
those that are most endangered. However, genomic
analyses also carry a heavy burden{data sets are enor-
mous, often requiring diverse computational approaches
for assembly, quality control and analysis.
The La Kretz annual workshop provides a comfort-
able, rigorous, but informal training environment for a
small group of motivated graduate students to explore
how conservation problems can best be addressed with
genomic-level data. Our goal is to provide hands-on
experience in the ecient collection, troubleshooting,
and analysis of large data sets for conservation-relevant
problems. One of the highlights of our workshop is
active participation from members of several govern-
mental agencies who are at the forefront of endangered
species protection and management, providing a forum
for exploring the most relevant aspects of conservation
genomics to managers.
The UCLA/La Kretz workshop is held at the La Kretz
Field Station (https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/santa-monica-
mountains-research/) and Stunt Ranch Reserve (http:/-
/stuntranch.ucnrs.org/) in the heart of the Santa Monica
Mountains. Only 30 miles from UCLA and the LAX air-
port, but nestled in the relatively undeveloped 160,000
acre Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,
the Field Station/Stunt Reserve provides an ideal loca-
tion to explore new developments in genomic science
and pressing needs in conservation and management
together in a single setting.
Our current instructor list, drawn from UCLA faculty
and several other partner institutions, includes: BenFitzpatrick (U. Tennessee Knoxville) Kirk Lohmueller
Evan McCartney-Melstad Ian Wang (UC Berkeley, ten-
tative) Brad Shaer Victoria Sork Bob Wayne Ying
Zhen Erin Toelmier Alice Mouton/Devaughn Fraser
Emily Curd/Zach Gold Agency partners represented
include: USGS BLM USFWS CDFW
Topics covered include: Overview of traditional conser-
vation genetics Next generation platforms: the best tool
for the job Data management pipelines: Quality Control
Data storage Data organization Data types and analyses:
SNPs Sequences Exploring very large data sets Func-
tional genomic data RNA-seq RADseq pipelines, from
raw reads to analyzing data Genomic data and GIS Vi-
sualizing geographic structure and demographic history
Admixture, clines, and hybridization Detecting adaptive
variation RNAseq in a conservation context eDNA as
an emerging tool Prerequisites: Available housing limits
course enrollment to ~20 students. Preference will be
given to masters and doctoral candidates who are in the
early to middle stages of their thesis research, and who
have some familiarity with using a command line inter-
face or programming languages (i.e. Perl, python etc.).
We also welcome applications from postdocs, faculty,
and government researchers, although our top priority
is graduate student applicants. We encourage appli-
cations from women, minorities, and individuals from
under-represented demographics in the sciences.
Admission and Fees: Applicants will be admitted based
on academic qualications and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $425. This includes
food and lodging at the La Kretz Field Station, as well
as any incidental fees, for the duration of the course (ar-
riving Saturday March 25, departing Thursday March
30).
This year, the workshop is co-sponsored by a UC Cata-
lyst program grant, which will provide some student sup-
port and stang. University of California students from
any campus may apply for partial support (up to $225)
from the newly awarded Conservation Genomics Con-
sortium (https://ucconservationgenomics.eeb.ucla.edu/)
funded under the UC Catalyst program. To do so, sim-
ply note in your application that you would like to apply
for this partial support.
UCLA students are encouraged to take the La Kretz
Workshop for graduate credit. Other UC students may
also be able to take the course for credit.

Dr. Martin Jones (Founder, Python for Biologists) Dr.
Bert Overduin (Training and Outreach Bioinformatician,
Edinburgh Genomics)
WORKSHOP FORMAT
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks atthe organiser's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
A description of the sessions can be found at the bottom
of this page.
WHO SHOULD ATTEND
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a basic knowl-
edge of Python.
Note that we are also oering a workshop Data Manip-
ulation and Visualisation with Python. The Advanced
course is aimed at people who want to develop bigger
or more complicated programs in Python, or to learn
more about the language, or to explore dierent ap-
proaches (object-oriented, functional) to programming.
The material covered is very general purpose and can
be applied to any kind of problem. The Dataviz course
is about using a set of Python libraries that are speci-
cally designed for data exploration and visualisation. In
the Dataviz course, we're going to concentrate on using
these tools to explore patterns in data, but the actual
code that we write will be very simple - mostly we will
be calling the functions and methods in these libraries.
To summarise: if you want to learn more about the
language, build more complicated programs, or need to
work with existing complicated programs, attend the
Advanced course. If you want to explore datasets, nd
patterns, produce gures and charts, attend the Dataviz
course.
REQUIREMENTS
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein acces-
sion number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence is).
They should also have basic Python experience (the
Edinburgh Genomics Introduction to Python for Biol-
ogists course will full these requirements). Students
should be familiar with the use of lists, loops, functions
and conditions in Python and have written at least a
few small programs from scratch. During the workshop
students will use their own laptops. Instructions for any
software to be installed will be sent out prior to the
course.
SESSION CONTENT
1. Data structures in Python
In this session we will briey recap Python's basic data
structures, before looking at a couple of new data types
\ tuples and sets " and discussing where each should
be used. We will then see how we can combine these
basic types to make more complex data structures for144 EvolDir February 1, 2017
solving specic problems. We'll nish our discussion
by looking at specialized data types that are found in
the Python core library. This session will also be our
rst introduction to benchmarking as we talk about
the relative performance of dierent data types. In the
practical session we'll learn how to parse an input le
into a complex data structure which we can then use
to rapidly query the data. Core concepts introduced:
tuples, sets, higher-order data structures, default dicts,
Counters, big-O notation.
2. Recursion and trees

[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/] . Course overview:
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a
popular platform for all types of bioinformatics work,
from simple one-o scripts to large, complex software
projects. This workshop is aimed at complete beginners
and assumes no prior programming experience. It
gives an overview of the language with an emphasis on
practical problem-solving, using examples and exercises
drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics work.
After completing the workshop, students should be in
a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to
tackle problems in their own research and (2) continue
their Python education in a self-directed way. Intended
audience:
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. Teaching
format:The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.

Previous versions of this 5-day workshop were given
at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NES-
CENT) at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina
from 2011-2013, and then at the National Institute for
Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) at
the University of Tennessee in Knoxville from 2014-2016.
Like past versions, the Friday Harbor version will review
the basics of theory in the eld of evolutionary quantita-
tive genetics and its connections to evolution observed at
various time scales. The aim of the workshop is to build
a bridge between the traditionally separate disciplines
of quantitative genetics and comparative methods.
Quantitative genetic theory for natural populations was
developed considerably in the period from 1970 to 1990
and up to the present, and it has been applied to a wide
range of phenomena including the evolution of dier-
ences between the sexes, sexual preferences, life history
traits, plasticity of traits, as well as the evolution of
body size and other morphological measurements. Text-
books have not kept pace with these developments, and
currently few universities oer courses in this subject
aimed at evolutionary biologists. Evolutionary biolo-
gists need to understand this eld because of the ability
to collect large amounts of data by computer, the de-
velopment of statistical methods for changes of traits
on evolutionary trees and for changes in a single species
through time, and the realization that quantitative char-
acters will not soon be fully explained by genomics.
This workshop aims to ll this need by reviewing basic
aspects of theory and illustrating how that theory can
be tested with data, both from single species and with
multiple-species phylogenies. Participants will use R, an
open-source statistical programming language, to build
and test evolutionary models.
The workshop involves lectures and in-class computer
exercises. You can consult the 2016 tutorial website for
examples, it will be found at http://www.nimbios.org/-
tutorials/TT eqg2016 The intended participants for thisFebruary 1, 2017 EvolDir 147
tutorial are graduate students, post-docs, and junior
faculty members in evolutionary biology. The work-
shop can accommodate up to 35 participants. Guest
instructors will include:

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword148 EvolDir February 1, 2017
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
