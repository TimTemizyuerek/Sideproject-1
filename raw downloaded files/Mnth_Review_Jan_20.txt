International Conference of Quantitative Genetics, Bris-
bane, 14-19 June 2020
We were delighted with the response to the call for oral
abstracts. We have put together a great program that
gets to the heart of some of the core issues in quantita-
tive genetics (QG) of the 21st century.
* We have a session on epistasis 'V perhaps the most
confused and confusing topic in QG. Led by theory
from Nick Barton <https://icqg6.org/invited-speakers/-
nick- barton/ >, with contributed talks from plant,
livestock and human applications, followed by what
we expect to be a lively panel discussion. * We have
several sessions on the thorny topic of genotype by en-
vironment interaction, genotype by environment corre-
lation and the genetic control of environmental vari-
ance. Looking at the same problem from the per-
spective of dierent organisms can help reveal dier-ent ways of approaching data collection and analysis.
Several of our invited speakers will be addressing this
topic in dierent ways 'V from wild birds by Anne
Charmantier <https://icqg6.org/invited-speakers/anne-
charmantier/ >, livestock by Han Mulder <https:/-
/icqg6.org/invited-speakers/han- mulder/ >, crops by
several contributed talks. * While genetic risk prediction
of common disease is a new hot topic in human genetics,
the methods are rmly grounded in quantitative genetics
of livestock and crops. We have speakers using the big
data sets of humans, such as Albert Tenesa <https://-

Budapest MathStatMolBio
Apr18-19
The 30th Workshop on Mathematical and Statistical
Aspects of Molecular Biology (MASAMB) will be held
in Budapest on April 18 and 19, 2020.
Registration opens early 2020. For details see http://-
masamb2020.elte.hu and below.
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running series of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression, pro-
teomic, metabolomic and single-cell genomics technolo-
gies. These immense data resources, and the underlying
complexities of molecular and cell biology, provide ex-
citing research opportunities for numerate scientists.
With typically around 80-120 participants from mathe-
matics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, biol-ogy and related elds, the MASAMB meetings provide
an intimate setting for exchanging ideas in method-
ological and applied research. Research students and
scientists newly entering the eld of genomic research
are particularly welcome and encouraged to submit ab-
stracts. Details of previous meetings are available at the
MASAMB archive: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-
srv/masamb/ sszolo@gmail.com

GenomicBiomonitoringInsects
Jul19-24
We would like to invite submissions to our symposium
entitled *Genomic tools for biomonitoring of insects*,
held during the International Congress of Entomology
(ICE 2020) on Wednesday the 22nd July 2020 in Helsinki,
Finland,
How landscape-scale disturbances aect insect diversity
remains poorly known. The lack of data is in part due to
the fact that traditional biomonitoring schemes are too
labour intensive and costly to handle large amounts of
samples and taxa. The development of high-throughput
sequencing allows the detection of insects from bulk sam-
ples. The underlying techniques are advancing rapidly,
and renements are being made constantly to improve ef-
ciency and reduce error. Talks will provide an overview
of the current and future applications of new molecular
technologies in insect biomonitoring.
*Topics of interest include*:
- Biomonitoring of terrestrial and aquatic insects using
metabarcoding and mitogenomics.
- Metabarcoding of bulk samples from mass trapping
(Malaise, interception traps $B!D(B)
- eDNA
- Metabarcoding of ethanol-preserved samples
- PCR-free approaches
- Estimation of changes in species-abundance from
metabarcoding data

free to contact us:

other than HIV, so beginning this year, we encourage
the submission of abstracts relating to work on other
human viruses. We welcome submissions on all topics
on statistical, mathematical, and computational ap-
proaches to analyzing the dynamics and evolution of
human viruses.
Abstracts are being accepted for the following topics:
>>Origins & Evolution
>>Transmission Dynamics & Transmission Clusters
>>Between Host Evolution & Epidemiology
>>Within-Host Dynamics & Modeling
>>Software & Methods
>>Immunology & Vaccines
>>Antiviral-Treatment & PrEP
>>HIV-Latency & Reservoirs
>>Outbreaks

Final list of attendees: 2020 April 15th
Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and con-
cepts form an essential basis for modern evolutionary
studies. The goal of the MCEB conference (at its 12th
edition) is to bring together scientists with diverse back-
grounds to present recent advances and discuss open
problems in the eld of mathematical and computational
evolutionary biology. The theme of this year's edition
will be on \Climate Changes and their Impacts on Evo-
lution", in particular the preservation of biodiversity,
the conservation of species, the study of ecosystems and
their dynamics, and the reconstruction of major past
changes of climate and living conditions on Earth. All
speakers will be kindly asked to say a few words (or a full
talk!) on these crucial questions and how they interfere
with their own research. Moreover, special attention
will be given to Machine Learning approaches, which
should be key in the development of complex models
and the analysis of big data sets. General concepts,
models, methods and algorithms will also be presented
and discussed, just as during the previous conference
editions.
Where and when: Hameau de l'Etoile, near Montpellier,

Places left!
**** deadline for nancial aid extended to Thursday
Dec 12 **** Priority will be given to participants from
countries in the tropics
Many conservation genetics tools have been developed
for use in temperate other high latitude habitats, and so
not all of these tools translate to the tropics. Tropical
habitats share some features which complicate the ap-
plication of some conservation genetics tools which are
heavily relied upon in higher latitudes, and also share
some basic questions and problems that are less of an
issue in higher latitudes or other, better studies and/ or
less diverse habitats.
This course will discuss practical issues, genetic and
genomic theory, tools and analyses as applied to issues
relevant to conservation in the tropics. Some basic
questions of conservation importance include describ-
ing species diversity, determining species distributions,
characterizing the basic biology of species, and under-
standing demographic history and population size and
structure. Underlying biogeographic histories that have
shaped communities, and the biotic interactions within
those communities are also of fundamental importance.
There is an optional, personalized conservation genetics
project immediately following the lecture and computer
practical week.
This course is designed with students and practitioners
of Conservation Biology or Conservation Genetics in the
tropical regions of America, Africa and Asia in mind.
This course will take place January 27-31, 2020 in the
Biological Reserve of Do nana (Spain).

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS 16TH ANNUAL EARLY
CAREER SCIENTISTS SYMPOSIUM
-Natural History Collections: Drivers of Innovation-
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Michigan invites nominations of
outstanding scientists early in their careers to partic-
ipate in an exciting symposium about innovative and
unconventional uses of biological collections across scien-
tic disciplines. The symposium events will take place
13-15 March 2020, on the campus of the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor.
Eight early career scientists will be selected to present
their work and generate intriguing discussions at the
2020 ECSS symposium. In addition, two keynote speak-
ers will be featured in the symposium. We welcome
nominations of early career scientists who study and
utilize natural history collections in new and potentially
unexpected ways. We envision this symposium as a
way to showcase the often-unrealized opportunities and
non-traditional avenues of research that museum collec-
tions make possible to the entire scientic community,
and emphasize some of the interdisciplinary ways in
which collections are being or could be used. We hope
to foster a broader understanding and expanded use
of the incomparable resource that is a biological collec-
tion. This symposium aims to highlight the work of
up-and-coming scientists whose research interests spana breadth of disciplines in collections work including
but not limited to: comparative genomics, bioengineer-
ing, climate change, historical pathogen dynamics, and
many, many more. We both advocate for and cham-
pion diversity and strongly encourage the nomination
of members from groups traditionally underrepresented
in science.
Early career scientists are considered senior graduate
students (who stand to receive their Ph.D. within one
year), postdoctoral researchers, and rst- or second-
year faculty. A colleague or advisor must provide the
nomination.
Nomination materials must include a brief letter of
recommendation addressing the nominee' ^As scientic
promise and ability to give a compelling talk, nomi-
nee'^As curriculum vitae, and a brief abstract of the
proposed presentation ( <200 words, written by the
nominee).
Nominations should be sent electronically as a single
PDF le to ecss-2020@umich.edu using the subject line
format, \nominee' ^As Last Name, First Name ECSS 2020
Nomination".
Review of nominations will begin on January 7, 2020.
Selected participants will be contacted in mid-January
and will have all expenses covered (registration, travel,
and accommodation). An ocial announcement of the
slate of speakers will be issued soon thereafter.

PhD position available on Microbiome Ecology and Evo-
lution.
The group of Dr. Jaime Iranzo studying \Evolution-
ary dynamics of genomes, viruses, and microbial pop-
ulations" at the Centre for Plant Biotechnology and
Genomics (CBGP, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,
Spain) oers a PhD position under La Caixa Founda-
tion's INPhINIT Programme to study the evolution
of ecological interactions, metabolic interdependencies,
and virus-microbe predation networks within human
and environmental microbiomes.
DEADLINES 4 February 2020 (\Incoming" fellowship,
for candidates that have not resided in Spain for more
than 12 months in the last 3 years). 26 February 2020
(\Retaining" fellowship, for candidates that have resided
in Spain for more than 12 months in the last 3 years).
TITLE: Interplay of evolutionary and ecological pro-
cesses in the microbiome
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Evolution of bacteria and
archaea critically depends on the exchange of genes
through multiple mechanisms collectively known as hor-
izontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT occurs at time scales
that overlap with those of ecological processes, gener-
ating diversity in microbial populations and providing
ready-made tools that facilitate fast adaptation to en-
vironmental challenges. As a result, the sharing of
genetic information through HGT underlies much of the
adaptability and evolutionary plasticity of prokaryotes,
aecting their population and community structure. A
second driving force of microbial evolution is the arms
race between viruses and hosts, which not only results
from but also modies predator-prey ecological inter-
actions within the microbiome. While the importance
of HGT and virus-host arms races in microbial evolu-
tion is widely recognized, their combined eects on the
dynamics of complex microbiomes is less well known.
To ll these gaps, we are applying methods from compar-
ative genomics, ux balance analysis, and mathematical
modeling to large metagenomic datasets in order to in-
vestigate how HGT and virus-host predation networksshape the microbiome over time and determine the
structure and stability of microbial communities. This
bottom-up approach will add an evolutionary perspec-
tive to our understanding of microbiomes, leading to
more accurate predictive models for the management of
microbial communities.
JOB POSITION DESCRIPTION: We are seeking a
highly motivated candidate with strong quantitative
and computational skills and a background in bioinfor-
matics, computer science, or biology. The PhD student
will join a multidisciplinary team of young scientists
that study fundamental aspects of microbial ecology
and evolution using empirical data, computational tools,
and mathematical models.
The PhD student will contribute to the research of the
group by investigating how evolutionary processes, such
as gene gain and loss, strain replacement, and virus-host
coevolution, aect ecological interactions within the mi-
crobiome. Depending on the candidate's background
and personal interests, the project can be oriented to-
wards (a) the development and application of advanced
comparative genomic methods to infer metabolic inter-
dependencies within microbial communities, virus-host
infection networks, and their variation over time based
on deep-sequencing metagenomic data; (b) the develop-
ment of integrative mathematical models to predict the
response of a microbiome, in terms of composition and
stability, to the evolutionary processes listed above; or
(c) a combination of both.
FELLOWSHIP BENEFITS: The doctoral fellowship
INPhINIT \La Caixa" is devoted to attracting talented
early-stage researchers of any nationality who wish to
pursue doctoral studies in top-level research institutions
in Spain and Portugal. Benets of the Program include

Edinburgh InsectHermaphroditism
Dear all,
I am looking for a talented and enthusiastic evolution-
ary/molecular biologist or entomologist for a 4-year
PhD position in my lab http://lauraross.bio.ed.ac.uk
at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of
Edinburgh. There are funding options for both UK
and international students. If you are interested please
contact me directly (laura.ross@ed.ac.uk) to discuss.
Deadlines vary depending on funding source: 13th of
December for non-UK, 9th of January for UK, but please
contact me at least a week before the ocial deadline if
interested!
The evolution of hermaphroditism in insects
Summary Organisms reproduce in diverse ways. Yet it is
unclear why and how new reproductive strategies evolve.
This project focuses on the only case of hermaphroditism
in insects: In species of the scale insect Icerya, female-
like hermaphrodites produce both sperm and eggs and
self-fertilize.
Project background Understanding why there is such
variability in the way organisms reproduce is one the
most important unsolved puzzles in evolutionary biology.
This project aims to tackle this question by focusing
on the unique and puzzling reproductive strategy of
the scale insect Icerya purchasi. This species is the
only insect unequivocally described as hermaphroditic;female-like hermaphrodites can produce both sperm and
eggs and self-fertilize. But how can a female produce
sperm? A recent hypothesis suggests that the sperm
present in hermaphrodites seem to have originated from
the individuals father \infecting" his future ospring
with sperm-producing cells. However although the data
is suggestive, this hypothesis requires further scrutiny.
It is also unclear why, while most ospring develop as
hermaphrodites, a small number develop as males. Fi-
nally it seems that while hermaphroditism is exceedingly
rare in insects, it might have evolved independently in
several close relatives of Icerya. This PhD project will
explore how and why this unusual reproductive system
evolved by using comparative methods across species
as well as experimental and genomic analyses in the
laboratory. Together this work will help us to better
understand what evolutionary forces shape the ways
animals reproduce.
Research questions The projects sets out to test a num-
ber of key questions to better understand the evolution
of the only insect hermaphrodite:
* What is the evolutionary and developmental origin of
the sperm produced by female-like hermaphrodites? *
Hermaphrodites can self-fertilize, so why and how do
they occasionally produce male ospring? * How fre-
quently did hermaphroditism evolved within the clade of
insects and do any ecological factors predict the patterns
we observe?
Methodology The project will use two main approaches:
The rst will focus on collecting insect specimens of
dierent Icerya species, and then use molecular phyloge-
netic methods to determine their evolutionary relation-
ships, and to study transitions between reproductive
strategies employed by the dierent species. This part
of the project is in collaboration with Prof. Penny Gul-
lan, The Australian National University, Canberra. The
second part of the project will focus on Icerya purchasi.
We will use laboratory experiments and a combination
of cytogenetic and genomic approaches to study dierent
aspects of the reproduction of this species.
Training A comprehensive training programme will be
provided comprising both specialist scientic training
and generic transferable and professional skills. Speci-
cally the student will undertake training in the use of
molecular wet lab techniques, the analysis of sequenc-
ing data and the use of microscopy and cytogenetic
approaches.
Requirements Candidates must be highly motivated
with a keen interest in evolutionary biology and genetics
and a strong motivation to pursue a scientic career.
Previous experience working with insects and phyloge-
netic and genomic analyses would be advantageous.20 EvolDir January 1, 2020

BeeEvolutionaryEcology
PhD: Studying bumblebee population dynamics and
adaptations to understand plant-pollinator evolution
under climate change Supervisors: Richard Gill, Jacob
Johansson & Keith Larson
To date our understanding of how insect pollinator de-
clines are inuenced by climate change remains limited.
For instance, why have some species shown evidence of
latitudinal range shifts in apparent response to climate
change when others have not? To address this type of
question requires us to understand the eco-evolutionary
processes by which insect pollinator populations and
their host plants are dynamically responding and how
this translates to plant-pollinator network evolution
under climate change. Taking a population biology ap-
proach (using complementary genetic approaches), this
project will look to understand how bumblebee popula-
tions and host plant visitations have changed over the22 EvolDir January 1, 2020
past 50 years for an Arctic bumblebee community in
Lapland, Sweden. This will involve understanding how
preceding climatic condition has aected population
demography of each of 13 species of bumblebee. The
study will reveal changes on population trait frequencies
over space and time and how resource competition is de-
termined through adaptations to temperature extremes
to predict plant-pollinator network structure and the
potential for species invasions.
The project takes advantage of a unique phenology tran-
sect established over a century ago allowing us to com-
pare past data on bumblebee/plant community compo-
sition and phenology with contemporary data spanning
the major warming over the last ve decades. The tran-
sect runs along an altitudinal gradient on Mount Nuolja,
Abisko, providing a thermal cline with the study taking
a space-for-time substitution approach. The student
will become experienced in using a number of interdisci-
plinary techniques, including a variety of eldwork skills,
bee and plant taxonomic identication, molecular meth-
ods in DNA barcoding and population genetics, studying
bee thermal proling, managing and analysing big data,
skills in ecological network construction, statistics and
developing mathematical models to understand extinc-
tion vulnerability. The project will involve a signicant
amount of eldwork in the Arctic and will require the
candidate to be relatively physically t. This interdisci-
plinary project will also benet from co-supervision &
collaboration from a number of world-leading scientists,
including: Jacob Johansson (Imperial College and Lund
University, Sweden); Keith Larson (Umea University,
Sweden); Jason Tylianakis (Canterbury University, NZ),
Andrew MacDougal (University of Guelph, Canada);
Emily Baird (Stockholm University (Sweden).
The PhD is competitively funded. The student will
based at the Silwood Park campus of Imperial College
and hosted by the Gill lab that is well equipped to
study bee evolution and ecology. The student will be
surrounded by world leading researchers in the disci-
plines of ecology, evolution and conservation. Facilities
include 100 hectares of eld site, new controlled envi-
ronment rooms, microbiology facility, labs tailored for
bee research and spacious workspace.

LausanneU EvolutionBehavior
PhD position in comparative neurogenetics and be-
haviour
We are looking for a PhD candidate (earliest start-
ing date: 01/01/2020) to develop a project in compar-
ative neuroscience and behaviour in the lab of Prof.
Richard Benton (www.unil.ch/cig/benton) under the
co-supervision of Dr. Thomas Auer at the Center for
Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Switzer-
land.
The candidate will develop his/her project within the
larger lab topic of behavioural evolution using the
chemosensory system of the closely-related Drosophila
species D. melanogaster and D. sechellia. These ies
show opposing behaviours upon exposure to hexanoic
acid: D. melanogaster is repelled while D. sechellia is
attracted. This behavior is highly relevant for the ecol-
ogy of D. sechellia, as it lives exclusively on a single
host fruit enriched with hexanoic acid. We are using
a comparative evolutionary approach to decipher how
acid sensing circuits dier between both species.
This involves RNA-sequencing, neurogenetic tool de-
velopment for functional imaging in chemosensory cir-
cuits, genome engineering and behavioural analysis (see
Auer et al., bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/-
10.1101/546507v1 as relevant reference).
Our experiments will answer the fundamental question
of how evolutionary adaptations in the chemosensory
circuits lead to dierential sensing of information at
the periphery and/or how neural circuit connectivityJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 23
modies the perception of the sensed information in the
central brain. Ultimately we aim to link genetic and
neural changes to an animal's behavioural choices and
the occupation of specic ecological niches.

LundU EvolutionMulticellularity
Doctoral Student in Biology
Project description A fully funded PhD position is avail-
able to work on evolutionary transitions to multicel-
lularity. The student will work within the molecular
ecology and evolution lab as well as the aquatic ecology
group at the Department of Biology, Lund University.
Over evolutionary time there have been several major
transitions that have shaped contemporary patterns of
organismal complexity. In each of these transitions a
group of individuals that previously replicated indepen-
dently joined together to form a new, more complex life
form. For example, single cells joined together to form
multicellular organisms just as certain species of animals
have foregone independence to live and reproduce in
social groups.
Work description This PhD position will examine what
predisposes some species to undergo the transition from
unicellularity to multicellularity, and why multicellu-
larity has been lost in some lineages. The project will
initially focus on green algae where there have been
gains and losses of multicellularity across species and
will use a combination of experimental evolution, eco-
logical and life-history data from natural lake systems
and comparative analyses across dierent species.
This position will provide opportunities to generate
independent ideas and learn social evolutionary the-
ory; omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics &
metabolomics); developmental biology and the evolution
of life-cycles; experimental evolution design and analy-
sis; lab and eld experiments with micro-organisms; a
range of microscope techniques including SEM, TEM,
spatial and temporal visualisation; advanced statistical
modelling and phylogenetic comparative methods.
The Department of Biology has a number of dierent
research units including evolutionary ecology, molecu-24 EvolDir January 1, 2020
lar and microbial ecology, aquatic ecology, speciation,
sexual selection, and host-parasite coevolution, and as
such the PhD student will be integrated in a lively,
stimulating and diverse intellectual environment.

whether parasites' prevalence and virulence is altered
under elevated temperatures and if long-term exposure
to warming amplies this eect. The successful candi-
date will use a combination of experimental evolution
and eld approaches to generate new predictions re-
garding the evolution of parasites in a warmer world.
He/she will use a model system consisting of the crus-
tacean Daphnia and their microparasites. The project
oers opportunities to learn state-of-the-art methods
and a range of transferable skills.

NERC QUADRAT DTP CASE: Understanding and
predicting the success of alien freshwatersh
Project Description
Overview:
Alien species, those introduced outside their native
range, are a major driver of environmental change that
may lead to the extinction of local biodiversity, alter
ecosystem services and cause huge economic damage.
With increasing global trade, the number of new alien
species is growing rapidly. Thus, identifying which
species may establish and become invasive is an ur-
gent global challenge. However, with no history of past
invasion, it is hard to predict which new alien species
will establish, and which ones will go naturally extinct.
Freshwater sh are among the most frequently intro-
duced vertebrates and many have major detrimental
eects on the most vulnerable ecosystems on Earth 'V
freshwater habitats. Surprisingly, we know remarkably
little of why some sh species are more likely to establish
and spread in novel regions, and which species are likely
to be the future successful aliens.
Aim:
To identify which species' ^A traits facilitate the intro-
duction, establishment and spread of alien freshwater
sh and predict the probability of success of potential
future invaders, at global and local scale.
Objectives:
1) To build a global scale database on freshwater sh
introductions, introduction pathways, and species traits;
2) To test which species characteristics determine the
probability of introduction, establishment and spread
of alien freshwater sh using the database, phylogenetic
comparative methods and theoretical modelling; 3) To
produce a Horizon scanning output that informs policy,
by quantifying how dierent pathways to introduction
(e.g. angling, sheries, pet trade) inuence the prob-
ability of release in novel regions, and deriving their
probability invasion at global and local scale for speciesJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 29
likely to be introduced globally and in the UK and Ire-
land in particular. There is also the possibility to carry
out case studies in the eld in Ireland, Argentina or
Indonesia.
Training:
The student will be trained in data collection and man-
agement of large datasets, state of the art phylogenetic
comparative approaches in R and mathematical models
of range expansion, and will use Queen' ^As University
High Performance Computer KELVIN. The student will
engage with stakeholders through a 3 months placement
at AFBI.
While working on important ecological questions and a
global challenge, the student will gain a rare set of inter-
disciplinary skills that increase employability, including
cutting edge statistical and mathematical modelling,
data management, numeracy, evaluating risk and un-
certainty, as well as gaining in depth understanding
of fundamental principles in ecology and freshwater
science. Through the placement the student will gain
better understanding and skills required to inform policy
on environmental monitoring and management.
Start date:1 October 2020
Duration:42 months

\Global proles of species declines and success in the era
of climate change"
A PhD position to join the MacroBiodiversity Lab
(http://selectiondynamics.weebly.com/) at Queen's Uni-
versity Belfast funded by NERC as part of the
QUADRAT Doctoral Training Partnership is open for
applications to start in October 2020.

proles-of-species-declines-and-success-in-the-era-of-
climate-change/?p115924 Project Description The
alarming extinctions of species worldwide pose unprece-
dented challenges for wildlife and human wellbeing.
But, what factors drive species to extinctions? Why
do some species face extinction risks while others seem
to be thriving? Do some species benet from the
extinctions of other species? Just like medicine and the
insurance industry do, can we identify the 'prole' of
features that dene threatened species, and the prole
of species that are thriving with climate change? These
are all critical questions that we are only starting to
elucidate. Traditionally, conservation agendas around
the world have estimated extinction risks based on the
'conservation status' that is assigned to each individual
species - these are static 'labels' used to class species
within either threatened or non-threatened categories.
However, while this classic approach has shaped our
understanding of the modern extinction crisis, it largely
neglects whether species are currently undergoing
population decreases, increases or stability. Estimating
extinction risks based on these 'population trends'
is a critical pending challenge, given that ongoing
population declines lead to extinctions (even in species
currently classed as non-threatened), while ongoing30 EvolDir January 1, 2020
population increases can indicate progressive recovery
(even in species currently classed as threatened).
This project implements a global-scale research pro-
gram investigating the drivers of population declines
and increases in the world's amphibians - one of na-
ture's most endangered animal lineages. The project
is part of the Global Amphibian Biodiversity Project
(GABiP), a scientic initiative investigating the diver-
sication, distribution, and extinctions of amphibians
worldwide. Using a global dataset spanning population
trends, reproduction, morphology, ecology, and distribu-
tion for>4,000 species, and a range of state-of-the-art
phylogenetic and spatial computational techniques, this
project will (1) elucidate the 'prole' of traits shared by
species in decline and of those with increasing/stable
populations, (2) combine multiple environmental vari-
ables to establish the geographic areas hosting high
concentrations of declining and succeeding species, to
ultimately (3) develop quantitative predictions about
geographic areas of threat and of success around the
globe, to inform conservation action and policy.
Start date: 1 October 2020
Duration: 42 months
Eligibility: Candidates should have (or expect to

AmphibianSexualSelection
\The extinction of the sexier? A global investigation
of the role of sexual selection in modern amphibian
declines"
A PhD position to join the MacroBiodiversity Lab
(http://selectiondynamics.weebly.com/) at Queen' ^As
University Belfast funded by the DfE is open for
applications to start in October 2020 (funding duration:
36 months). The closing date is the 13th January

the-extinction-of-the-sexier-a-global-investigation-
of-the-role-of-sexual-selection-in-modern-amphibian-
declines/?p115361 Project Description: Biodiversity
is undergoing alarming declines worldwide. Modern
species extinctions are predominantly attributed
to environmental factors, mostly climate change
and habitat destruction. However, sexual selection
'competition over mates'drives evolution of intrinsically
costly traits (calls, ornaments, displays) that increase
chances of population collapses, thus potentially leading
to non-ecological extinctions. But, is sexual selection
a factor responsible for ongoing species extinctions?
Despite its enormous implications for our understanding
of current and future global biodiversity, this question
remains unresolved. Existing theories linking sexual
selection to extinctions make contradictory predictions
'Vsome models suggest that sexual selection accelerates
extinctions, while others suggest that it mitigates
species declines. Unfortunately, empirical evidence
remains limited.
This project implements the rst global-scale research
programme investigating whether the worldwide extinc-
tions of one of nature' ^As most threatened lineages, am-
phibians, are accelerated by the widespread evolution of
a particularly costly sexual trait 'Vadvertisement calls,
known to enhance mortality via energetic and ecolog-
ical costs. Using a dataset spanning morphological,
ecological, life history, genomic, climatic, geographic
and phylogenetic data for 7,000+ amphibian species,
this project aims to establish the mechanistic connec-
tions between sexual selection and extinctions at an
unprecedented scale. This project is part of the Global
Amphibian Biodiversity Project (GABiP) led by Dr
Daniel Pincheira-Donoso.

6 Months funding of 3500 Euros for a Master project
available at Rennes, France, on \Where will herbivores
succeed to track the phenologies of their host trees under
climate change?" Note that you can be registered at
your home university.
In short: Under what conditions do communities and
populations of herbivorous insects track phenologies of
their host trees? Rather in a neighborhood of other hosttrees or rather in isolation among non-host trees (low or
high phylogenetic isolation)? Rather on trees with high
or low intra-individual variability? The results will help
to predict under which conditions herbivorous insects
will follow the change of their hosts imposed by climate
changes. The focus is on the budburst phenology of
trees, but other aspects can be treated.
The project is a study on the eects of climate change
that is mechanistic and experimental. We will take
into account the micro evolutionary response of her-
bivores, and the physiology of trees. We will test
micro-evolutionary responses to climate through lar-
val mortality. The project may help to identify eco-
evolutionary structures of tree communities that al-
low an evolutionary response of herbivores to climate
change, a form of eco-evolutionary feedback. The project
may also help to identify how these eco-evolutionary
structures of tree communities can be used to con-

of Animal Ecology, Department of Zoology, Stockholm
University, Sweden, as part of the project \Evolving
modularity in the adaptations of phytophagous insects
to their host plants", newly funded by the Swedish
Research Council.
The project aims to improve our understanding of the
causal mechanisms behind the evolutionary patterns
observed in insect-plant associations, and is based on
the idea that adaptations to specic host plants can
best be understood as \modules" of co-expressed genes
and the corresponding phenotypes { in particular larval
performance on dierent hosts.
Work in the PhD project will focus on butteries, and
will involve eld collection and laboratory rearing of in-

as genomic analysis of in particular RNA-sequencing
data. Experience from rearing and genomics of non-
model insects will thus be particularly meriting.
The position is for four years full time. To be eligible
you need a degree corresponding to at least four years
of higher education, including an independent project
at an advanced level in animal ecology, evolutionary

Graduate Opportunity in Applied Conservation Genet-

Supervisor: Dr. Joanna Freeland, Dept. of Biology,
Trent University
The magnolia tree Magnolia acuminata, commonly re-
ferred to as the Cucumber Tree, is a forest canopy
species growing in remnants of the Carolinian forest in
southern Ontario, where it is classied as endangered.
Previous research that was based on the population
genetics of extant populations found that saplings had
lower genetic diversity than mature trees, which raises
a concern for the long-term sustainability of popula-
tions (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-
015-0746-9). This graduate project will build on earlier
research by collaborating with the Carolinian Canada
Coalition and other partners to develop a plan for sup-
plementing existing populations with genetically diverse
saplings. The research will involve genotyping saplings
and working with partners to develop a restoration plan
in which trees will be planted in a manner that should
maximize the genetic diversity of future generations.
Applicants should have an interest in conservation ge-

'Plus One' MS opportunities in Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology at Tulane University.
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in
the School of Science and Engineering at Tulane Univer-
sity (http://www2.tulane.edu/sse/eebio/) encourages
applications to our 'Plus One' MS program, a one-year,
non-thesis MS program.
The Plus One degree program is designed for students
who are interested in seeking employment with environ-
mental agencies of federal, state, and municipal govern-
ment; non-governmental organizations; and in private
industry, including environmental consulting rms. The
program also will be useful for students planning to
enter more advanced professional degree programs (e.g.,
law, public health, medicine, veterinary medicine, natu-
ral resources management) and for students intent on
pursuing additional academic training (e.g., Ph.D. de-
gree programs). The program is also useful for students
seeking to strengthen teaching skills and pedagogy for
a future career in education.
Students have freedom to design the program to meet
their educational and professional needs, but typically
elect to pursue one of three loosely dened tracks in the
program:
(1) Research, in which students work closely with a
tenured or tenure- track faculty mentor, with the goal of
strengthening research capacity and potentially produc-
ing a peer-reviewed publication; these students typically
use this track as a steppingstone to a Ph.D. program in
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology or a related eld. (2)
Pedagogy, in which students work closely with one or
more teaching faculty mentors, with the goal of strength-
ening teaching experience and skills, including the option
to serve as an Teaching Fellow in EBIO 1010, Diversity
of Life; these students typically go on to teach at the high
school or elementary school level or otherwise engage
in educational activities. (3) Knowledge base, in which
students work with the Graduate Studies coordinator
or other faculty member to identify courses required to
bolster transcripts and knowledge base; these studentstypically go on to apply to professional degree programs
such as law, medical, or veterinary schools or join the
workforce.
We have established a strong track record of assisting
Plus One students to meet their professional and ed-
ucational goals. Recent graduates from the program
are currently in highly regarded PhD programs, law
schools, medical schools and vet schools; teaching in
high schools; and working in industry and governmental
and non-governmental agencies.
Our department houses a strong team of outstanding
researchers and educators, with established strengths
in coastal and tropical systems. We are committed to
promoting diversity in STEM, and particularly welcome
applications from members of groups that are tradi-
tionally under-represented in the eld of Ecology &
Evolutionary Biology.
Students are encouraged to directly contact the faculty
member or members they are interested in working with
as advisors.

PopulationGenomicPlantPathogens
The Chair of Phytopathology at the Technical Univer-
sity of Munich, TUM School of Life Sciences, hires a
PhD Student in the eld of Population genomics of
pathogens on wild tomato species.
We are interested in understanding the diversity and
evolution of pathogens and pathogen resistance in rel-
atively short time scales, therefore we study dierent
populations from a diverse and geographically dier-
entiated tomato species, Solanum chilense. We have
shown that these populations show dierent levels of
defence against a range of pathogens. For this project
we have collected hundreds of strains of naturally occur-
ring pathogens (Alternaria spp.) from S. chilense plants
throughout the species range in Chile and Peru.
We are now looking for an enthusiastic PhD student
assess genetic diversity of the collected strains using
whole genome sequencing (ONT) to study adaptation
of the pathogen to the dierent host populations. The
applicant must have a very good MSc in biology, bioinfor-
matics or related disciplines. Knowledge of and practical
experience in sequence analyses or population genetics
and keen interest in molecular plant pathology are re-
quired.
The project will be carried out in the group of Dr.
Remco Stam at the Chair of Phytopathology (Prof. Dr.
Ralph H uckelhoven). The chair hosts several research
groups studying biology of plant pathogens. In addition,
we have several ongoing collaborations on campus (in-
cluding the large SFB924 project) and direct access to
state of the art technology for next generation sequenc-
ing, diverse molecular biology techniques and extensive
glass house facilities.
The Technical University of Munich wishes to increase
the percentage of employed women. Women are there-
fore explicitly encouraged to apply. Handicapped per-sons with equivalent qualication will be given prefer-
ence. The salary is according to German income level

Research within the Applied Evolutionary Ecology
(AEE) research group centre's around evolutionary ecol-
ogy dened as a eld within both ecology and evolution
that examines how interactions between and within
species evolve. Understanding the evolutionary eects
of organism interactions is of fundamental signicance
in ecology, evolution, agriculture and human health. We
study how antagonistic (pathogenic) and benecial (mu-
tualistic) fungal symbionts are shaped by host ecology
and evolution, how ecological and evolutionary factors
determine the species-range partners interact with, and
how new species interactions are established, for exam-
ple through partner-shifts. We mainly use molecular
and applied bioinformatics coupled with experimental
work. Our work is fundamental in nature, but of ap-
plied signicance for example for biological control and
pathogen host shifts.

Modelling Neurocristopathies in Xenopus, mechanisms

gies are a major group of congenital diseases in human,
and a heavy societal concern. The NEUcrest network
comprises 20 partners in academia, industry and hos-
pitals from seven European countries, gathered in a
synergistic eort to advance knowledge and outreach
about these diseases.
The adrenal gland is derived from NC and mesoder-
mal lineages. Disorders of the adrenal glands can lead
to congenital neuroendocrine anomalies, autoimmune
disease, neurocristopathies and tumors such as neurob-
lastoma. The embryology of this organ has not beenwell-studied; therefore, it has been dicult to correlate
developmental gene-function interactions and identify
novel disease variants. In this project the student will:
1) determine a temporal and spatial map of the develop-
ment of the adrenal gland during Xenopus embryogene-
sis including how the NC contributes to its development.
2) generate novel assays for gene discovery and function
of diseases associated with the adrenal gland. Poten-
tial syndromes to look at include Allgrove syndrome
and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Assays will include

measurement of adrenaline and noradrenaline levels. 3)
carry out a small molecule enhancer/suppressor screen
on an adrenal gland Xenopus model line generated by
the student.
The student will gain skills in molecular biology, embry-
ology, in vivo biology and chemical biology. In addition,
training for transverse skills in outreach and industrial
managements are deeply embedded in the ITN pro-
gramme.
Micro RNA regulation of neural crest development Mi-
croRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs around
22 nucleotides in length that inhibit gene expression by
translational repression or by causing degradation of
target mRNAs. Some genes associated with miRNA pro-
duction are deleted in neurocristopathies (e.g. DGCR8
in DiGeorge Syndrome). We have identied two microR-
NAs (miR-196a and miR-219) expressed in the early
neural crest. Our preliminary studies show that knock-
down of either miRNA in the model organism Xenopus
tropicalis (African clawed frog) causes a loss of neu-
ral crest tissue and are therefore predicted to target
genes involved in NC specication. In this project the
student will identify potential targets of miR-196a and
219, validate possible targets using cell-based luciferase
assays and knockout of target sites in specic genes by
CRISPR/Cas9 and determine where miR-196a and 219
act in the gene regulatory network for NC development.
The student will gain skills in molecular biology, embry-
ology, in vivo biology and chemical biology. In addition,
training for transverse skills in outreach and industrial
managements are deeply embedded in the ITN pro-
gramme.
The start date is exible and it will be possible for the
successful candidate to start prior to 1 April 2020, but
applicants should discuss this with Dr Wheeler in the
rst instance.
Interviews will be held week commencing 6 January

UEdinburgh ParasiteEvolution
A studentship on \The evolutionary ecology of dis-
ease transmission: how will vector control programmes
change parasite life histories?" is available in the Reece
Lab, University of Edinburgh, UK. This studentship is
available to start ASAP rather than in Autumn 2020.
More details can be found here, including eligibility
criteria and how to apply [deadline 10th Jan 2020]:
https://www.ndaphd.com/phds/project/the-
evolutionary-ecology-of-disease-transmission-how-
will-vector-control-programmes-change-parasite-life-
histories/?p114770 The Reece lab uncovers the
strategies parasites have evolved to cope with the
challenges of their lifestyle and to exploit the oppor-
tunities it brings, by asking \what makes a successful
parasite and what are the evolutionary limits to their
success?". Specically, we investigate how parasites
maximise \survival" and \reproduction". These tness
components underpin the severity and transmission of
diseases.
Most disease research focuses on interactions between
parasites and their hosts. Analogous studies of interac-
tions between parasites and vectors have been largely
neglected, despite the fact that vectors are responsible
for spreading disease. Clearly, to fully understand the
evolution of vector-born parasites it is necessary to ask
how they solve the challenges of living in hosts and in vec-
tors. This is especially important for malaria parasites
whose vectors are changing in response to vector-control
programs (e.g., bed nets, insecticides). Whilst the evo-lutionary responses of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes
to vector-control are being monitored, the knock-on con-
sequences for parasite evolution have been overlooked.
Just like drugs or vaccines administered to hosts, vector-
control represents an ecological perturbation aimed at
reducing parasite tness. History clearly illustrates that
attempts to reduce the survival and/or transmission of
malaria parasites is usually met with counter-evolution
(e.g., drug resistance mutations and phenotypic toler-
ance). Parasite counter evolution to vector-control may
be constrained or facilitated, depending on the amount
of genetic variation and plasticity underpinning parasite
phenotypes. Anticipating parasite evolution will inform
monitoring strategies for current control programs as
well as uncovering novel new vector-control strategies.

UGlasgow BatSatelliteVirus
PhD position: Cross-species transmission of bat-
associated satellite viruses
A fully-funded 4-year PhD studentship on the biology,
epidemiology, and evolution of satellite viruses is avail-
able in the Streicker Group at the University of Glasgow,
UK.
Satellite viruses are hyperparasites that require a fully-
functioning, unrelated 'helper virus' to spread between
cells and individual host. This obligatory dependence on
a second virus should constrain the ability of satellites
to switch host species; however, we recently discovered
a satellite virus in South American bats that appears to
be capable of switching host species and helper viruses.
This is important since satellites generally alter the viru-
lence of their helper viruses so could eectively functionJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 43
as host-jumping virulence factors that act on a variety
of viruses. We currently understand neither the extent
to which satellites jump between species nor how they
establish associations with new host species or helper
viruses. This PhD will use a combination of in vitro
experiments, eld studies on wild bats in Peru, and
metagenomic sequencing to understand the mechanisms
that allow satellite viruses to switch species and the
risks they may pose to humans and livestock. The exact
balance of laboratory/eld/bioinformatic projects will
depend on the experience and interests of the successful
candidate.
We seek a candidate who is passionate about exploring
new biological processes and integrating research across
biological scales - from cells to populations to species.
The successful candidate should have a strong back-
ground in at least one of the following: bioinformatics,
laboratory virology, wildlife disease ecology or evolution,
but must be motivated to work across disciplines.
The student will work in a vibrant community of ecolo-
gists, epidemiologists and evolutionary biologists at the
Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Compara-
tive Medicine and virologists and bioinformaticians at
the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Re-
search. Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland and the
third largest in the UK. It is a UNESCO City of Music,
a 2018 New York Times Top 10 holiday destination, and
located in close proximity to Scottish highlands which
oer world class hiking and outdoor activities. It is also
the top city in Europe for openness, tolerance and trust.
The supervisory team includes Dr Daniel Streicker (in-
fectious disease ecologist), Dr Laura Bergner (molecular
ecologist), Dr Richard Orton (bioinformatician) and Dr
Arvind Patel (virologist).
This PhD is funded through a new Wellcome Trust Inte-
grative Infection Biology Programme at the University of
Glasgow. UK/EU or International students are eligible,
but must have rst or upper second class UK honours
degree, or the international equivalent. While not a
strict requirement, a masters degree in a related eld is
recommended. Details of the program structure and eli-

AnthraxGenomicEpidemiology
PhD project: Leveraging pathogen genomics and phylo-
dynamics to control endemic anthrax
We are seeking applicants for a 4-year PhD position in
One Health and genomic epidemiology, jointly super-
vised by investigators at the University of Glasgow and
the University of Edinburgh. The position is open to
UK, EU and international applicants.
Recent advances in sequencing technology have revolu-
tionised our ability to track infectious disease dynamics
using pathogen genomes, such as during outbreak inves-
tigations [1]. However, these tools remain underutilised
for addressing endemic disease threats, especially those
aecting human and animal health in low-resource set-
tings. Anthrax is a classic example of a neglected bac-
terial zoonosis, aecting marginalised communities in
many parts of the global south, including much of Sub-
Saharan Africa [2]. It causes signicant mortality in
people as well as livestock losses, but tends to be undi-
agnosed and underreported [3]. Although vaccination of
livestock plays a key role in preventing infection in both
people and animals, it is often not aordable. Moreover,
because the spores of the anthrax bacterium Bacillus
anthracis can remain infectious within the environment
for decades, it is not clear how long livestock vaccination
would have to be maintained before a measurable re-
duction in infection risk is achieved. Obtaining genome
data from detected cases, and incorporating genomic
and epidemiological data into phylodynamic models [4],
provides a novel and powerful means to track residual
anthrax transmission and quantify progress towards its
elimination.
This project aims to create the necessary framework for
guiding anthrax control programmes in endemic settings
through the use of pathogen genomics and phylodynamic
modelling.
Specic objectives are to: 1) Extend current analytical
tools and molecular clock models to accommodate the44 EvolDir January 1, 2020
alternation between extended environmental persistence
and periodic rapid replication typical for B. anthracis; 2)
Develop a simulation model combining genomic, spatial,
temporal and epidemiological information to examine
the eect of vaccination on B. anthracis genetic diversity
and transmission in silico; 3) Validate this model by
generating genomic data obtained during a livestock
vaccination program expected to start in the study area
in 2020.
Supervisors Dr Roman Biek (Reader, University of Glas-
gow), whose primary research interest is infectious dis-
ease ecology. He has wide-ranging experience in quan-
titative and phylogeographic approaches incorporating
both spatio-temporal and genomic sequence data.
Dr Samantha Lycett (Group Leader, University of Ed-
inburgh) has expertise in pathogen phylodynamics and
population modelling. She brings to the project ex-
tensive experience in developing new computational
tools and models to gain epidemiological insights from
pathogen genome data and guide control eorts (e.g.
eradication of bovine diarrhoea virus from UK farms).
Dr Taya Forde (BBSRC Future Leader Fellow, Univer-
sity of Glasgow) is a molecular epidemiologist with a
particular interest in the transmission dynamics of bac-
terial zoonoses. She has led the collection of long-term
genomic data from cases of animal and human anthrax
in Tanzania and brings expertise in the genomics of
Bacillus anthracis.
Dr Tiziana Lembo (Senior Lecturer, University of Glas-
gow) is a eld veterinary scientist with an interest in
applied infectious disease epidemiology in complex multi-
host environments. She has a long track record of pro-
ductive collaborative research in Tanzania, including
in the area of One Health interventions, and has been
helping support Tanzanian stakeholders in developing
vaccination campaign strategies.
The student will thus benet from a highly multidisci-
plinary supervisory team. They will be primarily based
at the University of Glasgow's Institute of Biodiversity
Animal Health and Comparative Medicine (BAHCM),
at the main campus (Gilmorehill). The Institute pro-
vides a rich and collaborative research environment with
a strong track record of applying evolutionary and quan-
titative approaches to One Health problems.
Combined, this supervisory group has the available re-
search platform and expertise to guide the student in
developing novel approaches that capitalise on epidemio-
logical and genomic data to gain insights into pathogen
dynamics towards informing anthrax control eorts. The
student will greatly benet from expertise, networks and
opportunities at both Universities. The student will de-velop core skills in bioinformatics, phylodynamics and
population modeling and gain familiarity with the elds
of bacterial genomics, neglected zoonotic diseases, One
Health and intervention studies.
The project builds on robust partnerships and research
platforms established in northern Tanzania by the Glas-
gow supervisors, including existing genomic and epi-
demiological data. It also brings together

ULiverpool ClimateAdaptation
Designing landscapes that are robust to climate change
A PhD position is available at the University of Liver-
pool to develop new mathematical and computational
methods that will support the design of new nature
networks. Your mathematical models will account for
population dynamics and dispersal, ensuring that the
best ecological information is used when designing 'con-
nected landscapes' that will allow species to shift their
geographic distributions in response to climate change.
Global warming and habitat loss present signicant chal-
lenges because a species needs to be able to reach new
(climatically suitable) locations before its current geo-
graphical range becomes inhospitable. Therefore, theJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 47
limited amount of habitat that can be preserved or re-
stored must be arranged as networks that are suciently
well connected to allow species' ranges to shift over time,
and extensive enough that they can move long distances.
But, what is the best design for these networks? Un-
fortunately, existing computer models that incorporate
realistic details of a species' ecology are far too slow to
design habitat networks, and currently available tools
make over-simplistic assumptions.
You will build on recent advances in mathematical popu-
lation dynamics to develop new and ecient methods for
accurately predicting the spread of populations through
habitat networks, and you will test the robustness of the
model's predictions using empirically observed range
expansions for buttery species in the UK.
This project will suit a graduate of a quantitative dis-
cipline (e.g. mathematics, physics, computer science)
who wishes to apply their skills to environmental change
biology, or a biologist with strong mathematical and/or
computational skills. You will be part of the NERC
ACCE PhD programme, which will provide both sup-
port and training, and based at the University of Liv-
erpool. You will be supervised by a multi-disciplinary
team comprising Stephen Cornell (Mathematical Ecol-
ogist), Jenny Hodgson (Conservation Biologist), and
Chris Thomas (Biodiversity Researcher). Funding Notes

UNeuchatel EvolutionaryBotany
A four-year PhD position combining ecology and evo-
lutionary botany is available in the Laboratory of evo-
lutionary genetics, Institute of Biology, University of
Neuch^ atel, Switzerland. The thesis is nanced by the
Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) within the
framework of a Sinergia project. It is directed by Prof.
Jason Grant (UniNe) and co-supervised by Dr. Pierre-
Emmanuel Du Pasquier (UniNe) and Dr. Beryl Laitung
(Universit e de Bourgogne, UMR Agro ecologie, Dijon,
France).
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Anthropic pres-
sure may lead to the rapid and sometimes irreversible
decline of botanical diversity, or on the contrary, favors
the expansion of certain non-native species. In Europe,
since the mid-20th century, the intensication and mod-
ernization of agricultural practices (mechanization withJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 49
deep ploughing, use of herbicides, seed sorting, densi-
cation of monocultures and systematic use of certied
seeds) has had an unprecedented impact on archaeo-
phyte messicole species (crop-related species that were
introduced mainly from the Middle East before the year
1500). As messicole species are generally therophytes
(annual plants that spend the dicult season in the form
of seeds), modernization quickly destroys seed stocks
in the soil and contributes to the decline of these popu-
lations that were common until the mid-20th century.
Although messicolous species are part of the oristic
richness of the dierent countries where they are now
native, they seem to have been introduced in the past by
man in the form of seed since the domestication of crops
from the Neolithic period (11000 to 9000 years ago).
Some species introduced secondarily and recently into
new regions may be locally abundant and may pass from
archaeophyte to neophyte status: this is the case, for
example, of the cornower (Centaurea cyanus or Cyanus
segetum), introduced into North America from Europe.
The main goal of this PhD is to study the population
dynamics of dierent archaeophyte messicole taxa with
varied population dynamics using functional ecology
(life history trait analysis) and evolutionary botany (ge-
netic analysis of evolutionary history) approaches. From
herbarium collections, we plan to recreate populations
from the 18th century to the present from which genetic
analysis and mapping will be carried out. Experiments
will be done in the eld (experimental station in Di-
jon) in order to analyze current populations. Fieldwork
is necessary to sample populations and establish the
current status and future of the taxa.
REQUIREMENTS The successful candidate holds a
master's degree in ecology, evolutionary biology or an
equivalent eld with an excellent academic record. A
strong interest in ecology, evolutionary genetics and a
good knowledge of botany is desirable. Periods of work
in experimental elds, in the laboratory, in herbaria and
in the eld are an integral part of this thesis.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND DEADLINE The
candidate should send a single PDF le by e-mail con-
taining 1) a letter of motivation describing research
interests, willingness to do a PhD, and suitability for
this subject, 2) a curriculum vitae, 3) a copy of master's

sis, and 5) the names and contacts of two referees. The

Supervisor: Pavel Flegontov, Ph.D. (contact pe-

Duration of study: 4 years
Institution: University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czechia
Collaborations: Harvard Medical School
Net salary: 20000 CZK
I am looking for a Ph.D. student who will start working
preferably in March 2020. I work as a senior sta sci-
entist in David Reich's group (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, USA) and as a group leader at the Univer-
sity of Ostrava, Czech Republic. The position is open
at the University of Ostrava with a starting net pay of
20000 CZK (scholarship and part-time salary combined).
Research stays at Harvard University are possible.
Research project: While ancient DNA sequencing proto-
cols became standardized and reached industrial scale,
standardization of data analysis protocols in archaeoge-
netics is conspicuously lacking. Currently most studies
are focused on the Bronze/Iron Age and historical peri-
ods characterized by increasing mobility and admixture
of people, and the complexity of tasks facing a genetic
data analyst ever increases. Genetic history of humans
is best approximated as a graph including divergence
and admixture events. Methods that test alternative
graph models or search the model space automatically
have been developed since 2012, and several classes of
these tools exist. But a dierent set of analytical tools
has become the mainstay of archaeogenetic studies: prin-
cipal component analysis, simple statistics measuring
shared genetic drift or symmetry of simplest population
trees (e.g., f3- and f4-statistics), and qpAdm - a tool
that tests if a target group can be tted as a mixture of
specied ancestral sources. A common feature of thosemethods is that they ignore the phylogeny. We show
that f4-statistics are insensitive to large-scale admix-
ture events under certain demographic scenarios, that
qpAdm often lacks sensitivity for distinguishing alterna-
tive ancestral groups, and that some popular protocols
for building admixture graphs (qpGraph) are awed.
We propose a method for inference of ancestral sources
based on qpGraph and a set of strict model ranking and
topology exploration rules. We show that this method
is superior in sensitivity to the standard techniques and
apply it for revaluating accepted views on the settlement
of America and Bronze Age Europe. We propose an
exhaustive simulation study of qpGraph/qpAdm, source
code optimization for qpGraph, preparing protocol pa-
pers, and application of the novel tool for reanalysis of
thousands of ancient genomes published.

One PhD position is available in the research group
of Pascal Milesi at the Evolutionary Biology Centre in
Uppsala, Sweden. Our research group works on plant
population genetics and evolutionary biology with a
special emphasis on local adaptation and genome evolu-
tion. We work on two groups of organisms: forest trees
(mainly spruces) and weeds (mainly the tetraploid weed
Capsella bursa-pastoris and its close relatives). Please
note that a background in Plant Biology is not required.
The deadline to apply is January 15, 2020.
For more information please con-

The environment.
The Evolutionary Biology Centre (http://-
www.ebc.uu.se/) is one of the world's leading
research institutions in evolutionary biology. It is
part of Uppsala University which is considered one of
Europe's leading universities in the subject of biology
bridging a broad variety of disciplines. The scientic
environment with numerous seminars, journal clubs and
social activities oer excellent possibilities for contacts
and collaborations. Our lab is part of the Department
of Ecology and Genetics and of the program in Plant
Ecology and Evolution (http://www.ieg.uu.se/), an
active environment addressing fundamental evolution-
ary and ecological questions with a wide range of
dierent approaches. As members of the Science for
Life Laboratory (http://www.scilifelab.se/) we make
extensive use of high performance computing resources
(https://www.uppmax.uu.se/uppnex) and extended
bioinformatic infrastructure (http://www.scilifelab.se/-
platforms/bioinformatics/). The lab is situated in the
student town of Uppsala that oers rich opportunities
in cultural and outdoor activities. Sweden's capital,52 EvolDir January 1, 2020
Stockholm, is less than an hour's train ride away.
The project.Understanding the genetic determinism of
phenotypic traits is of paramount importance to identify
and understand the mechanisms that drive their evo-
lution and, for instance, predict their evolution under
environmental changes. One major issue with genome-
wide approaches is that they usually focus on point
mutations and structural rearrangements are generally
not considered. Coniferous tree species are particularly
tted to address such questions as it is possible to ex-
tract and sequence DNA from haploid tissues and their
population are known to show strong pattern of local
adaptation. The PhD project thus aims at studying the
role of structural rearrangements (starting by gene du-
plications) in adaptation using an integrative approach
to link dierent levels of organization.
The position.This integrative approach will lead the
successful applicant to work in the eld (sampling and
common garden), in the wet-laboratory, and analyze
-omics and eco-evolutionary data. There will be also
possibility to participate in other ongoing projects on
local adaptation in spruce. The applicant is expected to
master main concepts in Evolutionary Biology, have a
good background in population genetics/genomics and
a solid foundation in statistics. Prociency in relevant
programming languages (e.g. bash, Perl, Python) will
be a strong advantage.
How to apply.Applicants with a proven record with
a Master degree are encouraged to apply. To apply

LongTerm Monitoring Pollinators
Deadline December 31st 2019
A PhD position is available for a highly motivated candi-

long-term monitoring of tropical insects.
A highly motivated postgraduate student is sought to
join a project funded by the Czech Academy of Sci-
ences integrating genomic and trophic information into54 EvolDir January 1, 2020
long-term monitoring of tropical insects. More speci-
cally the project will study the main insect pollinators
of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Current evidence
suggests insect pollinators to be undergoing population
declines worldwide with catastrophic consequences to
biodiversity and human crop production. These popula-
tion declines are dicult to demonstrate using census
data alone. High-throughput sequencing techniques
such as RAD-seq allow to study ne-scale population
genomic patterns such as population structure and eec-
tive population size. Using collections from long-term
monitoring eorts allow to study how populations have
been recently aected by factors such as climatic change
and anomalies. We seek to analyze recent population
changes of diverse insect pollinators (euglossine bees,
Cyclocephalini beetles and butteries). The ForestGEO
Arthropod Initiative has been monitoring arthropod
assemblages on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, since
2009. We will use these data to infer population ge-
nomic changes in the 25 most common pollinator species.
We will improve forecast of population dynamics using
ower resource, determined from DNA pollen metabar-
coding and litterfall trap data, as covariates of pollinator
time-series.
The student will implement eld work in Panama and
will be involved in laboratory analyses at the Univer-
sity of South Bohemia in the Czech Republic. His/her
main responsibility will be to develop a sound analytical
framework as to ultimately improve forecast of popula-
tion dynamics of pollinators on Barro Colorado Island,
one of the most intensively studied tropical forest in
the world. Developing related directions of research will
also be encouraged. The successful applicant will be
based at the University of South Bohemia in Ceske Bude-

USouthBohemia SexChromosomes
2 PhD positions in evolution of sex chromosomes at the
University of South Bohemia (Czech Republic).
Project description: Sex chromosomes, their dierentia-
tion, and role in speciation belong to the most intriguing
questions of evolutionary genetics. It was proposed that
comparison of patterns in sex chromosome evolution
between male and female heterogametic taxa could be
informative for identication of general features of this
process. Moths and butteries (Lepidoptera) repre-
sent the most speciose lineage with female heterogamety
(WZ/ZZ). Unlike in other WZ/ZZ taxa, sex chromosome-
autosome fusions are common in Lepidoptera, which
makes them ideal model system for investigations into
establishment and dierentiation of neo-sex chromo-
somes. The project combines cytogenetic and genomic
approaches to investigate the role of sexual antagonism
in turnover of lepidopteran sex chromosomes and exam-
ine genomic changes underlying degeneration of neo-W
chromosomes observed at the cytological level. The role
of lepidopteran neo-sex chromosomes in reproductive
isolation between moth sex chromosome races will be
tested.
Qualications: We are looking for enthusiastic students
with a MSc degree in a relevant eld interested in ge-
nomics of sex chromosomes and evolutionary forces driv-
ing their evolution. Candidates should have background
in biology and preferably good wet lab skills (cytoge-
netic and/or molecular biology methods) and at least
some basic skills in bioinformatics. Candidates should
also be able of independent work, have organization
skills, and speak good English.January 1, 2020 EvolDir 55
Funding: Projects will be funded by Czech Science
Foundation and Czech-American scientic coopera-
tion grant under the INTER-ACTION program of
the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of
the Czech Republic. The students will enrol in
one of 4-year graduate programs of the Faculty of
Science (https://www.prf.jcu.cz/data/les/8/123/172/-
3310rds2017.pdf) and receive a regular scholarship. In
addition the students will get 3-year part-time jobs
(health insurance included).

*PhD opportunity in an international group.*
*Pollution, aging and cancer in common gulls.*
Exposure to pollution shortens the life-span of humans
(i.e. Apte et al. 2018) and laboratory model animals
(i.e. *C. elegans*, Haghani et al. 2019), but little is
known about the eects of pollutants on wild organ-
isms, especially on aging rate and life-history. There
is data indicating that exposure to specic pollutants,
e.g. mercury, leads to tness reductions (Whitney and
Cristol, 2017), however, a systematic study of how wild
animals' life history is aected by the exposure to cock-
tail of pollutants including air pollution and various
forms of marine pollutants is missing. Animals that are
ecologically connected to marine pollution are especially
vulnerable to pollution eects, due to biomagnication
processes (Bryan et al., 1979).
Aging research has been traditionally conducted on
short-lived laboratory organisms (Holmes and Martin2009). Since long-lived organisms dier in their senes-
cence patterns from short-lived ones (Lemaitre et al.
2015) and senescence eects on life-history cannot be
measured in laboratory conditions (Speakman et al.
2015), biogerontological research should include more
long-lived wild populations.
Two main mechanisms related to senescence and
longevity are especially intriguing in this context. First,
attention should be turned to telomeres, repeats of DNA
at the ends of chromosomes, shortening with each cell
division, eventually passing a threshold length, after
which the cell starts to senesce (O'Sullivan & Karlseder,
2010). In birds exposed to urban pollution telomeres
shorten more quickly than in natural habitats (Salmon
et al. 2016), but little is known about the eects of ma-
rine pollution on telomere shortening and, consequently,
aging.
The second mechanism understudied in natural popula-
tions, but highly relevant in the context of aging, are
oncogenic processes. Cancer is an age-related disease
(White et al. 2014), however, prevention of cellular
senescence (i.e. through inhibition of telomere shorten-
ing) can lead to malignant processes. It is known that
human activities, especially related to pollution, can
increase cancer rate in wild populations (Giraudeau et
al. 2018).
We here suggest to use a combination of large-scale
comparative analyses and a eld study in a long-lived
seabirds as models for improving our understanding
of the interactions between pollutants, aging rate, life
history and oncogenic processes in natural populations.
*Methods:*
The planned project will be based on three approaches.
First, we will use the largest databases ever compiled on
telomere shortening (more than 100 species) and cancer
prevalence (1500 species) to test if aging rate predicts
neoplasia development. In addition, these databases
combined with already exciting databases owned by
Drs. Giraudeau and Vincze will be used to detect
the life-history predictors of aging rate in wild pop-
ulations Second, we will take advantage of the already
collected longitudinal data about common gull (*Larus
canus*) life-history parameters (e.g. body condition,
reproductive success), and compare these data to his-
torical changes in pollution levels (e.g. metallic trace
elements like mercury, lead and cadmium) and climatic
conditions. The data were collected from a breeding
colony of common gulls in the Baltic Sea that has been
monitored for 40 years. Third, we will use already col-
lected longitudinal samples from known-aged common
gulls to assess changes in telomere length and compare
these to pollutant exposure and life-history parameters56 EvolDir January 1, 2020
of the same birds.
The PhD student will be funded by a fellowship
from the University of Tartu (Estonia) and be
based in Tartu. Depending on funding availability,
the student will have possibilities to spend several
months per year in France to work with his/her co-
supervisors. He/she will also be encouraged to apply
for grants to spend some time in France. The stu-
dent will be co-supervised by Tuul Sepp (University of
Tartu, Estonia, https://www.researchgate.net/prole/-

Montpellier, France, https://www.researchgate.net/-

to aging. Mathieu Giraudeau will supervise the com-

versity of Turku
Comparative analysis of blood thyroid hormones and
life histories in vertebrates
Life-history variation (e.g. age of maturity, rates of
reproduction) constitutes a large part of biodiversity
within and across species. Yet the underlying physio-
logical correlates and mediators are not yet well under-
stood. We are seeking master student to join our project
where we study the associations between for blood thy-
roid hormones (THs) and life histories in vertebrates
at the University of Turku. The project aims to collect
population-level data of blood TH concentrations across
all vertebrates from the past studies in the literature
by conducting a systematic literature review, and apply
phylogenetic comparative analysis to test the potentialrelationships between THs and life-history variation.
Currently, we have identied ~12000 studies that may
or may not contain relevant data. The master student is
expected to help to screen abstracts and further full-text
screening for inclusion and exclusion, extracting data
from the included studies, and eventually participation
in the phylogenetic comparative analysis.
We expect:
* Advanced English communicating skills (CEFR B2
or higher) to ease the daily communication with su-
pervisors * Prior experience with advanced statistical
methods, such as general and generalized linear mixed
models, using the software R are required. * Relevant
education in biology (e.g. ecology, evolutionary biology,
physiology) to understand the content of the identied
scientic papers.
We oer:
* The master student will be jointly supervised by Dr.
Bin-Yan Hsu and Dr. Suvi Ruuskanen at Department
of Biology, University of Turku, and have a close collab-
oration with Dr. Hsu on a daily basis.
* Supportive environment in an active and interna-
tional research group at an international department
(see https://sites.utu./ruuskanengroup/) * For interna-
tional students, travel costs to Finland will be covered.
The recruited student is expected to start as soon as
possible, in Jan/Feb 2020. For international applicants
working remotely part of the time is also possible.
Questions and applications should be addressed directly
via email to Dr. Hsu and Dr. Ruuskanen.

UZurich PlantAdaptation
PhD position in plant adaptation
A PhD position is available in my group at the Depart-
ment of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Univer-January 1, 2020 EvolDir 57
sity of Z urich, for a period of four years. The position
is to study the evolutionary consequences of interac-
tions between plants and insects. Most studies on plant
evolution use either an ecological approach to study
mechanisms leading to future evolutionary change, or
study patterns of past evolution using phylogenetic ap-
proaches. In this project, we will conduct experimental
evolution using fast cycling Brassica plants to investi-
gate real-time adaptation in plants. This approach has
been proven highly successful in past experiments, and
enables to study in detail the process of ongoing evolu-
tion. As selective, variable biotic environment, dierent
communities of pollinators and herbivores will be used.
During 5 generations, groups of plants will be under
selection by these insects, and their adaptive evolution
will be studied. Afterwards, selection treatments will be
swapped to study the potential of plants to reverse their
evolutionary trajectory, as required during adaptation
in dynamic environments. Plant traits under adaptive
evolution will be studied using selection analysis, phe-
notyping, as well as molecular and bioinformatics tools.
The work will be primarily based in the greenhouse and
lab. You should have a Master (or comparable) degree in
any eld of biology and a thorough interest in evolution-
ary biology. Prior experience with plants and/or insects
is an advantage. Prociency in English both orally and
written is a must. The successful candidate will work
in an exciting research environment focusing on pat-
terns and process of plant evolution. Our department
is located in the botanical gardens and houses modern
molecular and ecological labs, including greenhouses and
climate chambers for plant cultivation. The University
of Z urich has a very broad coverage of organismal and
molecular biology, and several research groups work on
evolutionary topics (www.lifescience-zurich.ch). The
city also oers excellent quality of life through cultural
programs and infrastructure, as well as an attractive
surrounding.
If you are interested in the job, please send me by e-
mail (orian.schiestl@systbot.uzh.ch) a letter describing
your motivation, C.V., copy of degrees, publications
(manuscripts), and e-mail addresses of two academic

Wageningen.InsectEmbryogenesis
We invite applications from highly motivated candi-
dates with relevant research experience and a passion
for studying insect development. Insects display an
amazing diversity in Bauplan modications, species
and taxa richness. Remarkably, the insect diversity
is already reected in their embryogenesis in terms of
morphological and molecular variation. To date, most
molecular information about insect embryogenesis has
come from studies of model-organisms like Drosophila
melanogaster. However, understanding the extent of
gene expression variation during embryogenesis from
diverse insect lineages could elucidate broad develop-
mental constraints and novelty during insect evolution.
Towards this end, the PhD student will combine in
vivo documentation of embryogenesis of several phy-
logenetically diverse insect species and transcriptional
analysis from next-generation sequencing to identify
temporal gene expression dynamics in a comparative
manner. The PhD project will be imbedded within The
Graduate School Experimental Plant Sciences (EPS)
under the supervision of Dr. Sabrina Simon in the
Biosystematics Group, Wageningen University & Re-
search. You will be part of the Biosystematics group,
with about 25 employees, including technicians, PhD stu-
dents, post-docs, junior and senior scientists working on
fundamental questions about biological diversity. The
inter-university Graduate School EPS is a collaborative
research and teaching institution of Wageningen Univer-
sity (WU), Radboud University (RU), Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam (VU), Leiden University (LU), University
of Amsterdam (UvA), Utrecht University (UU) and
University of Groningen (RUG). The mission of EPS is
to organize the training of PhD students and postdocs
to become self-reliant researchers. The Biosystematics
Group is part of the Plant Science Group and works
closely together with other groups within Wageningen
University. The group research themes are: (1) ori-
gin and maintenance of plant and insect biodiversity,
(2) speciation, domestication and plant-animal interac-
tions, and (3) applying phylogenetic patterns to test
hypotheses on underlying evolutionary processes.
Requirements The successful candidate will have an MSc
degree in Biology. Students with an interest in insect
development, transcriptomics, gene expression analyses,58 EvolDir January 1, 2020
and evolutionary biology, are encouraged to apply, The
candidate should know or be willing to learn protocols
for setting up insect cultures, microscopy and dissection
protocols, next-gen sequencing methods and analyses,
and computer programming languages. Skills in molecu-
lar biological techniques and a proven ability to organize
laboratory experiments and bioinformatic pipelines are
highly advantageous. This position requires an excel-

The Porter lab at Washington State University, Van-
couver seeks a PhD student to join our research project
investigating how crop domestication aects benecialplant-microbe interactions. The student will have the
opportunity to conduct research that integrates across
our research in agricultural elds, the greenhouse, the
wet lab, and via computational approaches. Prior expe-
rience in areas such as Evolutionary Ecology, Agronomy,
Microbiology or Plant Science would be useful. The
successful candidate will join a collaborative research
team, so strong communication skills are a plus.
Project Background Over thousands of years of domes-
tication and crop improvement, humans have shaped
wild plant species into the diverse crops we depend
upon. While benecial microbes that live on and in-
side of plants play key roles in plant health, little is
known about how a plants' ability to benet from co-
operative microbes changes during domestication. To
investigate the evolution of plant benets from wild
plants to modern varieties, our project uses seed collec-
tions and genomic resources for legume crops ranging
from soybeans to peas as model systems. The utility of
legumes in agriculture lies in their unique symbiosis with
rhizobial bacteria, which convert atmospheric nitrogen
into useable forms, essentially fertilizing the plant. We
compare crops' ability to benet from rhizobia to that
of their wild relatives by integrating approaches from
phylogenetics, molecular genetics, quantitative genetics,
and genomics. Legumes account for a quarter of global
crop production and a third of human dietary protein.
Understanding how and why rhizobial symbiosis evolves
during domestication will help identify ways to improve
crop benets from microbes to increase our ability to
feed a growing human population.
Lab Description The Porter lab (https://labs.wsu.edu/-

Evolutionary Ecology of Plant-Microbe Interactions,
ranging from how symbiotic plants and microbes adapt
to environmental stresses to the ways in which plant-

A PhD position is available for a highly motivated candi-
date to integrate genomic and trophic information into
long-term monitoring of tropical insects.
A highly motivated postgraduate student is sought to
join a project funded by the Czech Academy of Sci-
ences integrating genomic and trophic information into
long-term monitoring of tropical insects. More speci-
cally the project will study the main insect pollinators
of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Current evidence
suggests insect pollinators to be undergoing population
declines worldwide with catastrophic consequences to
biodiversity and human crop production. These popula-
tion declines are dicult to demonstrate using census
data alone. High-throughput sequencing techniques
such as RAD-seq allow to study ne-scale population
genomic patterns such as population structure and eec-
tive population size. Using collections from long-term
monitoring eorts allow to study how populations have
been recently aected by factors such as climatic change
and anomalies. We seek to analyze recent population
changes of diverse insect pollinators (euglossine bees,
Cyclocephalini beetles and butteries). The ForestGEO
Arthropod Initiative <https://forestgeo.si.edu/node/-
145497/>has been monitoring arthropod assemblages
on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, since 2009. We will
use these data to infer population genomic changes in
the 25 most common pollinator species. We will improve
forecast of population dynamics using ower resource,
determined from DNA pollen metabarcoding and litter-
fall trap data, as covariates of pollinator time-series.
The student will implement eld work in Panama and
will be involved in laboratory analyses at the Univer-
sity of South Bohemia in the Czech Republic. His/her
main responsibility will be to develop a sound ana-
lytical framework as to ultimately improve forecast of
population dynamics of pollinators on Barro Colorado
Island, one of the most intensively studied tropical for-
est in the world. Developing related directions of re-
search will also be encouraged. The successful applicant
will be based at the University of South Bohemia <
https://www.jcu.cz/?set language=en >in Ceske Bude-
jovice and will perform eld work at Barro Colorado
Island<https://stri.si.edu/facility/barro-colorado >.

The Hom Lab at the University of Mississippi is seek-
ing a dedicated, full-time Research Associate (RA) to
assist with research and publications, the supervision
and support of students, and overall lab management.
The RA will primarily lead a NSF CAREER-funded
project on experimentally co-evolving model fungal-algal
mutualisms, but will also be given opportunities to be
involved in several projects in our eclectic research port-
folio (http://darwinsdaemon.com/research.php).
The successful candidate must be self-motivated and
a self-starter, growth-minded, highly disciplined and
organized, able to eectively multitask, and have an
attestable record of productivity and working well with
others. The candidate should have demonstrated experi-
ence working with microbes (fungi and algae are a plus)
and be enthusiastic about learning/developing new tech-
niques, approaches, and research areas. Experience in
molecular genetics, next-gen sequencing/bioinformatics,
and/or 3D-printing/device-tinkering are pluses. We en-
vision strong candidates having a Ph.D. in biology (or
related eld) but welcome applications from candidates
with a B.A./B.S./M.S. degree who have a substantial
laboratory/research background. The expected commit-
ment is for at least two years, with an initial one-year
term with review, and the potential to renew for up to
ve years depending on annual performance.
Our lab is interested in understanding how biotic and
abiotic factors dovetail to facilitate the formation, per-
sistence, and evolution of species interactions, notably
those that are symbiotic. We are particularly fond
of studying associations involving fungi, algae, and
cyanobacteria, and take a two-pronged approach to-
wards understanding how microbes interact to form
stable, functioning communities. In one approach, we
create new ecosystems of interacting microbes (syn-
thetic ecology) to test our predictive understanding ofJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 79
basic design principles in microbial ecology. In a com-
plementary approach, we focus on dissecting, manipu-
lating, and observing reduced microbial communities
(polycultures) isolated from nature to infer fundamental
rules. Our lab is passionate about STEM education
and outreach to individuals and communities in under-
served/disadvantaged contexts, while pushing forward
an innovative and world-class research program.
The University of Mississippi is located in Oxford, MS,
an idyllic and growing college town about 1 hr south
of Memphis, TN. In addition to SEC sports, a famous
tailgating culture at \The Grove," and a rich South-
ern culinary scene, Oxford is home to a vibrant music,
arts, and literary community with strong historic ties to
William Faulkner and The Blues. Ours is a very livable
city with a small town feel for those who value work-life
balance, community, and proximity to the countryside.

The Opportunity:
We are seeking a talented Bioinformatician or genomics
data scientist to contribute to the development of meth-
ods and software and to deliver high-quality analysis
and annotation for genomes in the Moore Foundation
Aquatic Symbiosis project. Sequencing technologies are
constantly evolving in terms of the type and volume of
the sequence data they produce. The recent progress in
long-read sequencing technologies means that we are now
able to eciently deliver high quality genome assemblies
for species that did not previously have such a resource.
We will produce thousands of genome assemblies for
symbiotic organisms, and analyse these to understand
their biology. There are opportunities and challenges in
the robust, integrated annotation and analysis of these
assemblies, and particularly in the co-analysis of sym-84 EvolDir January 1, 2020
biotic partners. One of the most challenging aspects of
this role will be to produce high-quality scientic results
on a large scale while adapting to rapid developments
in sequencing technology and software.
About the Programme:
The Tree of Life Programme at the Wellcome Sanger
Institute is dedicated to the generation and analysis
of high quality genome sequences from across eukary-
otic biodiversity. The Tree of Life team is initiating a
new, three-year project on theGenomics of Symbiosis
in Aquatic Systems, funded by the Gordon and Betty
Moore Foundation. We will use advanced genomics
toolkits to describe and decipher the biology of thou-
sands of species that live in intimate association. The
project will collaborate internationally to deliver ex-
citing research outcomes and further understanding of
the importance of symbiosis in generating diversity and
maintaining function in aquatic ecosystems. To deliver
this new project we are recruiting a team of molecular
biologists, computing scientists and project management
support.
About you:
This role would suit somebody with some previous expe-
rience with genome bioinformatics or other large scale
scientic data analysis, or a newly qualied graduate
student with data science skills interested in DNA se-
quence data. While desirable, previous experience with
DNA sequencing data is not strictly necessary for the po-
sition. We have a strong publication record and culture
of producing open data resources and open source soft-
ware development. This role requires an investigative
and solution-oriented mindset and excellent communica-
tion skills to work eectively within large national and
international consortia.

UParis Saclay Internship
BirdBehavior
Internship opportunity (5 months) : Daily foraging rou-
tines in common garden birds using birdfeeders - is the
proverbialearly birdliving in the garden?
UMR 8079 Ecologie, Syst ematique, Evolution (ESE),
Universit e Paris-Saclay, B^ at 362 Orsay in collaboration
with CESCO, MNHN
Carmen Bessa-Gomes (UMR 8079 ESE) Fran cois Chi-
ron (UMR 8079 ESE) Romain Lorrilli ere (UMR 7204
CESCO) Nicolas Deguines (UMR 7204 CESCO)
Timing of feeding and daily foraging routines have been
the object of research in the past, particularly in the
eld of optimal foraging. Daily foraging routines will
inuence energy budgets. Hence, albeit the proverbial
advantage of the \early" bird, past research has high-
lighted that under cold temperatures individuals may
delay the beginning of their foraging journey, limiting
the metabolic costs of foraging under cold temperatures.
Daily routines also depend of intraspecic interactionsand subdominant individuals have been shown to have
longer foraging hours in relation to dominant individu-
als. While an early start can reduce competition, it may
increase predation risk, diminishing overall survival. Re-
search on daily foraging routines has often been made in
controlled feeding apparatus focusing on target species
or functional groups. Hence, the role of interspecic
interactions other that predation have received scant at-
tention. Such approaches limit our understanding of the
impact of such interactions, particularly competition.
We propose to further such understanding by examining
the question of daily foraging routines at the community
level using bird feeders for garden birds.
Here we propose to examine the question of daily forag-
ing routines at the community level using bird feeders
for garden birds. We propose to test the following hy-
pothesis:
\Territorial species favour an early/dusk feeding pattern
relatively to species likely to participate in winter forag-
ing ocks"
Other than being present at close proximity to the re-
source, territorial individuals are likely to benet from
their familiarity with the local environment. We pro-
pose that they should reduce the cost of interspecic
competition by feeding before/after the presence hours
of winter foraging ocks.
We propose to test our hypothesis using the citizen
science scheme BirdLab. BirdLab is the rst citizen
science scheme that couples a serious game and bird
observation on a smartphone. It aims at gathering infor-
mation about foraging social behaviours of birds during
winter, using a standardized protocol. Data provided
are species abundance and interactions at feeders. The
participants set up two identical feeders 1-2 meters apart
and lled with sunower seeds. They can record up to
27 species among the most common and easily identi-
ed ones at bird-feeders. A user-friendly app (available
for tablet and smartphone on Android and iOS) repre-
sents the two feeders, as well as icons of the 27 species.
During exactly ve minutes, the participant will drag
and drop these icons between the feeders to mimic bird
movements they see. Hence, timing of bird arrivals,
departures and switch between feeders are recorded in
real time. Participants can repeat this 5 minutes pro-
tocol any time they want during winter season (from
November 15th to March 31th). After ve winters (since
the 15th November 2014), ca. 33,000 5 minutes sessions
have been performed covering the whole France and
2,264 participants sent data at least once.
The student will be based at the ESE lab in Orsay,
but there will be regular monthly meetings with all
researchers working on the project. The student willJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 93

Project details: Species richness and endemism of the
tropical-alpine oras of South America and Africa have
attracted botanists since the early 19th century. Evolu-
tionary mechanisms that generated such diversity, how-
ever, still remain largely unknown. The main goal of
this research is to compare the timing of plant radia-
tions in tropical-alpine habitats, detect key evolutionary
processes involved in these radiations, particularly those
related to Pleistocene climate oscillations, and assess
their relative contribution to the origin of plant diver-
sity in these biodiversity hotspots. To answer these
questions, the core of the project will be analysis of
intra- and inter-specic DNA sequence variation gath-
ered using the state-of-the-art methods (target capture,
hybridization-RAD sequencing) across several recently
diversied plant genera, and interpreting them in a com-
parative manner using available environmental and trait
data. The candidate is expected to be fully involved
in the overall project design and lead the analytical
part with opportunities to design spin-o projects. The
project allows an immediate start with phylogenomic
analyses, as a majority of samples are already collected
and partly (one genus) also sequenced. For more info

remarkably biodiversity in the Hengduan Mts, the Hi-
malayas and adjacent alpine regions, the world's hottest
hotspot for plant diversity and endemism, and want
to understand how this diversity has been formed and
evolved. Biogeography is at the heart of everything we
do, but we also devote to studies of macroevolution of
angiosperm functional traits. While not simply focusing
on single model lineage, we are committed to integrate
multiple taxa and new methods for studying the origin
of these oras. The Fellow will be a fully participating
member of the garden, and is going to collaborate with
group members on a funded project, which aims to com-
pare the assembly history of alpine oras at a global
scale, especially those in the Andes, the Alps and the

EuropeanResearchCouncil 2
EvolutionaryGenomics
ERC.2.EvolutionaryGenomics
Postdocs in evolutionary genomics and phylogenomicsare available to join the ERC 'GENECLOCKS' project
(http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/207593 en.html)
headed by Gergely Szollosi (http://ssolo.web.elte.hu) .
Two positions are oered for 2 years with the possibility
of a one year extension. The position comes with a
salary of up to EUR 43,200 per year (approx. up to
EUR 2,400-2,900 net per month after taxes), as well as
a travel and research funds.
We are looking for an individual who received his or
her PhD preferably within the last six years, who is
highly self-motivated and can work independently on a
project that he or she will help develop in the context
of GENECLOCKS.
A central theme of GENECLOCKS is disclosing new
sources of information for dating the rst three-quarters
of Earth's evolutionary history that are independent
from both fossils and molecular clocks. Life's early his-
tory has remained terra incognita until now, because
the fossils needed to calibrate standard evolutionary
timescales are simply not available for microbial life.
Microbial fossils are scarce and dicult to interpret in a
phylogenetic context with condence. In previous work
we have shown that patterns of lateral gene transfer
inferred from modern genomes encode a record of co-
existing lineages throughout the history of life, and that
we can use this record to reconstruct the relative ages
of microbial groups from the three domains of life in
deep time.
This discovery is a game changer for anyone interested
in the history of life, from either a geological or genomic
perspective. It demonstrates the existence of a new
and abundant source of dating information that is in-
scribed in the genome of any organism, provided a gene
transfer occurred in its ancestry. This constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the diversity of life.
Postdocs will undertake projects together with interna-
tional collaborators with the goal of either i) developing
new methods that systematically extract information on
the pattern and timing of genomic evolution by explain-
ing dierences between gene trees, or ii) apply existing
methods to resolve the timing of microbial evolution and
its relationship to Earth history and answer long stand-
ing questions. Possible collaborations and associated
projects include:
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Eukaryotes includ-
ing their position within Archaea in collaboration with
Tom Williams at the University of Bristol.
Implementing and applying methods to include trans-
fer derived relative age constraints in molecular clock
estimates with Bastien Boussau and Vincent Daubin at
the LBBE in Lyon.104 EvolDir January 1, 2020
Developing novel species-tree aware phylogenetic meth-
ods with the guys who make RAxML at Exelixis Lab in
Heidelberg and Nicolas Lartillot at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing new hierarchical probabilistic models of gene
tree-species tree reconciliation with Sebastian H ohna at
LMU in Munich.
Research visits of up to several months are foreseen as
part of potential collaborations.

A two-year postdoctoral position is available for a re-
searcher with strong qualications in population genet-
ics/landscape genetics, at the Health and Ecosystem
Unit at INRA Rennes (France). The work aims at iden-
tifying marine environment parameters which favor or
impair the dispersal and gene ow between coastal pop-
ulation of anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta) in
the Channel (see details below).
Project summary : Brown trout (Salmo trutta) exhibits
a strong individual variability in migratory tactics. In-
dividuals can spend their whole life in freshwater, or
migrate to sea for growth before returning to a river to
reproduce. This plasticity confers to the species a good
adaptive potential in a changing environment. This
behavior is determined by genetic and environmental
factors, still not fully elucidated. Trout populations
from rivers of the Channel area show a strong genetic
structure, but the marine form allows for gene ow be-
tween populations because homing (return to the native
river) is not strict. Sea trout favor coastal areas for their
feeding and movement, and these areas exhibit a strong
environmental heterogeneity (substrate, temperature,
sea currents...). The role of the marine landscape on
the environmental determinism of migratory tactics and
the functional connectivity of populations remains to
be elucidated. In addition, these areas are subjected to
strong anthropic pressure (shing, pollution, industrial
developments...) and alteration to the coastal areas
may impact the trout's usage of the marine environ-
ment, which can in turn impact connectivity at the
metapopulation level.
The postdoctoral work is part of the SAMARCH project
(Salmonid Management Round the Channel, INTER-
REG France-Channel-England https://samarch.org),
which aims at providing new data and information to
improve salmonid populations management, especially
in coastal and transitional areas, in order to minimize
the eect of environmental changes. The work aims
at describe and quantiy the gene ow between trout
populations of coastal Channel rivers in both France
and England, and identify the marine environment pa-
rameters which favor or impair the dispersion (habitat
functional connectivity). The analysis will be based on a
new genetic database of a few hundreds of SNPs for over108 EvolDir January 1, 2020

rently in production, in collaboration with University
of Exeter).
Prole and skills : PhD degree in population genetics,

not required.

The postdoc will lead analyses of multiple population
genomic datasets through time, including changes in di-
versity and signatures of selection, compare impacts and
changes across species, and conduct trait-based analyses
to understand characteristics of populations more or
less prone to genetic bottlenecks. The postdoc will also
contribute to summer population genomic workshops in
the Philippines. Extensive opportunities for collabora-
tion across the multi-institutional team, across Rutgers,
and in the region are available, including within the
Rutgers Genome Cooperative, the Institute of Earth,
Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, and the Genetics

populations from a diverse and geographically dier-
entiated tomato species, Solanum chilense. We have
shown that these populations show dierent levels of
defence against a range of pathogens. For this project
we have collected hundreds of strains of of the naturally
occurring pathogens (Alternaria spp.) from S. chilense
plants throughout the species range in Chile and Peru.
We are now looking for an enthusiastic Postdoc to assess
genetic diversity using whole genome sequencing (ONT)
to study adaptation of the pathogen to the dierent host
populations. The applicant must have a PhD in biology,
bioinformatics or related disciplines. Knowledge and
practical experience with ONT data, bioinformatics and
population genetics are required.
The project will be carried out in the group of Dr.
Remco Stam at the Chair of Phytopathology (Prof. Dr.
Ralph H uckelhoven). The chair hosts several research
groups studying biology of plant pathogens. In addition,
we have several ongoing collaborations on campus (in-

BacterialGenomeEvolution
Postdoctoral Research Fellow Position in Bacterial
Genome Evolution at the University of Auckland, New
Zealand
We are seeking a postdoc to work on a project inves-
tigating coevolution between prokaryotes and mobile
genetic elements (MGEs) such as viruses and plasmids.
The successful candidate will work on either the com-
putational modelling of bacterial genome evolution or
bioinformatic sequence analysis of bacterial genomes (or
both if desired).
The aim of the project is to test the hypothesis that
evolutionary conict between prokaryotes and MGEs
substantially impacts the distribution of genes and the
dynamics of horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes.
This impact is thought to arise from the interplay of
the two types of interaction between prokaryotes and
MGEs: ecological interaction, where MGEs serve as
selsh elements that exploit prokaryotes, creating host-
parasite conict; and genetic interaction, where MGEs
serve as vectors that mediate horizontal gene transfer
in prokaryotes, increasing gene mobility. By considering
both types of interaction, the project will develop a
theory of prokaryote genome evolution. The project will
consist of two parts: modelling part, where we develop
computational models of prokaryote genome evolution;
and bioinformatics part, where we analyse prokaryotic
genome sequences to inform and validate the modelling.
The successful candidate will work on either (or both
if desired) of these parts, depending on expertise andinterest. The candidate will also have the opportunity
to design their own research related to the evolution of
prokaryotes. The opportunity to gain teaching experi-
ence, such as lecturing and supervising, is also available
if desired.
The successful candidate will work with Nobuto
Takeuchi at Bioinformatics Institute, the School of
Biological Sciences, the University of Auckland, New
Zealand. Our lab is lunched in October 2018 and
interested in the evolution of biological complexity. For
Takeuchi's CV, please see https://researchmap.jp/-

New Zealand's top-ranked national university. The
School of Biological Sciences has a diverse research
portfolio, including molecular biology, microbial

MolecularEcolEvolution
Postdoc position in Molecular Ecology and Evolution
We are looking for highly motivated candidates to apply
for a 2-year postdoctoral position (that can be extended
for another 2 years), funded through the Fonds Na-
tional de Recherche Scientique (F.R.S.-FNRS), in the
labs of Profs Bertanne Visser and Caroline Nieberding
(UCLouvain, Belgium).
All living organisms have the ability for fat synthesis,
with the exception of parasitic wasps that were thought
to have lost and subsequently regained fat synthesis
during their evolution. Recent ndings have revealed,
however, that fat synthesis in these wasps was not lost,
but depends on environmental conditions: when devel-
oping in a fat-poor environment (lean hosts) wasps will
readily synthesize fat; yet when development occurs in a
fat-rich environment (fat hosts) fat synthesis can be shut
o completely. The main aim of this project is to eluci-
date how plastic responses in fat synthesis are regulated.
We will use an ' ^Aomics' ^A approach (RNA-sequencing,
epigenetics) to identify the molecular mechanisms re-
sponsible for switching fat synthesis on and o. The
project will mainly involve laboratory work, including
various molecular techniques. There is also room for
eld work and physiology experiments with dierent
host and parasitic wasp populations.
The ideal candidate for this position will have a strong
background in molecular biology/ecology and a capacity
for creative and critical thinking. Knowledge of RNA-
seq data production and analyses, and analysis of the
methylome is a plus. The candidate will have opportu-
nities to learn some of the specic skills required for the
project from our network of national and international
collaborators. Applicants should hold a PhD diploma.
The deadline for applications is December 31st, or until
the application is lled.
The salary will be between 2600-3000 euro gross per
month, including benets (e.g., health insurance), which
are included in the Belgian system. Our Univer-
sity is an Equal Opportunity/Armative Action Em-

and inbreeding on genomic variation and individual t-
ness. A unique collection of current samples and historic
data will be analyzed. We have already mapped more
than 100 genomes from Iceland and the neighboring
countries and applied Radseq analyses on the Icelandic
population. The study has implication for evolutionary
and conservation biology and the conservation of the
White-tailed eagle.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN GENOMICS
(xed period 15.1.2020 - 31.1.2022)
We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic
postdoc to join our Predator-Prey Interactions Group.
We use wood tiger moths (Arctia plantaginis) as our
model. This moth is a Holarctic, warningly coloured,
polymorphic moth in which alternative colour morphs
dier in behaviour, physiology and ecology. The project
aims to determine the molecular regulatory mechanisms
underpinning the colour polymorphism. Integrating
knowledge from these dierent regulatory levels (i.e.
molecule-molecule, predator-prey, and mating prefer-
ences) will allow us to elucidate how dierent factors
determine the overall tness of the dierent phenotypes.
The project will be carried out in close collaboration
with Prof. Chris Jiggins (Cambridge University) and
the postdoc will work both in Cambridge and Jyv askyl a.
We have already generated a high quality reference
genome assembly using a trio-based assembly method for
the study species (N50 >10Mb). We have resequenced
data and have identied a candidate region for the colour

UOslo 4y Metabarcoding
Postdoc UOslo: 4y Metabarcoding and environmental
DNA
The Natural History Museum is recruiting a postdoc
in metabarcoding and environmental DNA for a full-
time faculty funded four-year position (25 % of which is
devoted to required duties). The Natural History Mu-
seum (NHM) at the University of Oslo holds Norway's
most extensive collections of animals, plants, and fungi.
These natural history collections are invaluable reposi-
tories because they enable the scientic community to
answer key questions about geographical and temporal
variation in biodiversity. As a museum, we seek to be
at the forefront of developments in biology and adapt
our infrastructure to the needs of science and society
today. To develop our position at the cutting edge of
metabarcoding and environmental DNA, we are recruit-ing a researcher for a four-year postdoctoral position.
This person enters a vibrant research environment in
which ve out of eight research groups at the museum
apply and develop metabarcoding approaches, including
applied work on the authentication of food and medicine,
or for molecular biodiversity assessments, as well as to
answer ecological or evolutionary questions using aquatic
environmental DNA, trophic material, bulk invertebrate
and plant samples, soil DNA, and sedimentary ancient
DNA.
Traditionally, the museum ^As strategy emphasizes the
use and collection of individual scientic collections, ei-
ther through morphological or molecular research. The
collection infrastructure requirements of environmental
samples calls for a reassessment of our workows, includ-
ing physical sample storage, DNA bank storage, in-silico
repositories, and reproducibility of analysis pipelines.
In recent years, the museum has developed extensive
experience in metabarcoding research, and we aim to
increase the number of projects in these elds in the
near future. The museum aims to strengthen its prole
in environmental DNA/DNA metabarcoding by recruit-
ing a postdoctoral researcher with a proven track record
of scientic publications, international collaborations,
and external funding in this eld. The eld is broadly
dened and we are open to receive applications from
anyone making a strong case for themselves, their re-
search prole, and research plans with connection to
natural history collections. The postdoc will join the
Plant Evolution and DNA metabarcoding group led by
Prof. Hugo de Boer, but is encouraged to work with all
research groups at the museum.
Current research topics include:
- DNA metabarcoding of herbal products for authen-
tication - Aquatic eDNA monitoring of invertebrates
- Bulk insect biodiversity analysis - Vegetation type
assessments using soil eDNA - Molecular biodiversity
monitoring and restoration ecology - Dietary analysis of
herbivore interactions - Sedimentary ancient DNA from
cave sediments - Soil core ancient DNA from lake sedi-
ments - SedaDNA archaeobotany of monastery gardens
- Wood decaying fungi succession
The museum aims to strengthen its prole in environ-
mental DNA/DNA metabarcoding by recruiting a post-
doctoral researcher with a proven track record of sci-
entic publications, international collaborations and
external funding in this eld. The eld is broadly de-
ned and we are open to receive applications from any-
one making a strong case for themselves, their research
prole, research plans and its connection to natural his-
tory collections. This person will join a strong team
of scientists with a portfolio of eDNA projects and is132 EvolDir January 1, 2020
expected to contribute signicantly to the advancement
of scientic research on development and application of
environmental DNA/DNA metabarcoding.
We seek an active researcher with a relevant and strong
publication record that can collaborate with existing
groups and projects as well as develop their own re-
search program. The successful candidate should be on
an upward trajectory and is expected to have strong
potential to execute competitive research projects at a
high international level. They should have the ability to
create an attractive research environment and perform
research that inspires synergistic eects with current re-
search at the museum. The ideal candidate would focus
on using environmental DNA/DNA metabarcoding to
study fundamental questions in biology, rather than ap-
plying or developing methods. The museum also plays
a leading role in postgraduate education in biodiversity
and systematics through ForBio - Research School in

1. Postdoctoral position in population genomics of forest
trees (Milesi group)
The project. The development of next generation se-quencing has just begun to shed light on the complexity
of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits. How-
ever, the role of structural rearrangements in their con-
trol has received limited attention. Coniferous species
being of economic interest, a lot of genomic resources
were produced during the last decades in both west-
ern Europe and north America. These species are also
known to show strong pattern of local adaptation and
their genome is enriched in paralogous genes. The
project aims at studying the role of structural variants
in adaptation and convergent evolution in Coniferous
species.
The position. The successful applicant will be respon-
sible for gathering genomic data and analyzing them.
There will be also possibility to participate in other
ongoing projects on local adaptation in spruce. The
applicant is expected to have a solid background in pop-
ulation genomics, including associated lab work and be
familiar with UNIX environments and have experience in
standard bioinformatic approaches using high through-
put DNA and RNA sequencing data from platforms
such as Illumina. Prociency in relevant programming
languages (e.g. awk, bash, Perl, Python, C) will be a
strong advantage. Skills in modelling and simulation
would be considered a merit.
How to apply. Applicants with a proven record and
with a PhD degree are encouraged to apply. To apply

on evolution of polyploids (Lascoux group, https://-
lascouxlab.wordpress.com)
The project. The present position is associated with a
newly funded Swedish Research Council project that
focuses on the evolution of genomic polymorphism and
gene expression in polyploids, and more specically on
the importance of parental legacy in the evolution of
allopolyploid species. In particular, we aim to test
whether the evolution of gene expression is associated to
deleterious alleles and whether this relationship is less
pronounced in tetraploids than in diploids due to com-
pensation. This work will be based on new genome and
transcriptome sequencing in Capsella bursa-pastoris.

UTurku BirdMicrobiomes
Are you interested in gut microbiome, ecology, evolution
and physiology?
I am looking for an applicant to apply 3-year postdoc
grants from Turku Collegium for Science and Medicine,
to the following project in my group at the University
of Turku (Finland):
The role of gut microbiome in adapting to changing
environmental conditions (starting 1.9.2020)
All organisms on our planet carry microorganisms in
their gut. Human and animal model studies show that
gut microbiome is strongly linked to health. Host and its
full microbial community have been suggested to form
an inseparable entity 'V the holobiont. It is currently
heatedly debated whether and how microbiome may
help holobiont to adapt to variable environments. To
address this, holobiont studies must be taken from the
lab to the wild to reach the natural variation in develop-
mental and selective environments. In this proposal, our
overarching aim is to contribute to the understanding
whether microbiome can drive the holobiont adaptation
to environmental variation in wild populations, by fol-
lowing the principles of evolutionary theory (variation,
inheritance, selection, adaptation). The study will be
conducted at extensive temporal and European-wide
spatial scale using well-established wild passerine bird
populations, using both experimental microbiome ma-
nipulations and large-scale data collection. The project
helps to understand how microbiome can contribute
to phenotypic variation and allow animals to adapt to
changing environments.
Applicants: The applicant should preferably have exper-
tise in microbiology and bioinformatics. The applicant
is expected to have strong publication record, strong an-
alytical skills, interest in ecology, evolution and working
in wild populations.
We oer a position in an active, enthusiastic, interna-
tional research group in beautiful Finland. This is an
collaborative project with a large international network
across Europe. The position is very exible, and the
applicant can contribute to development of the project.
There are plenty of possibilities for supervision, too.

Yale EnvironmentEvolution
The Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies (YIBS) was
established in 1990 through a generous bequest from
Yale alumnus Edward P. Bass. YIBS is an umbrella
environmental science organization that supports theenvironmental community at Yale University through re-
search and training, grants and fellowships, and weekly
seminars and events (yibs.yale.edu). The newly estab-
lished Hutchinson Environmental Program, named in
honor of G. Evelyn Hutchinson, the father of modern
ecology, is intended to support the environmental priori-
ties identied in Yale's strategy to advance the sciences.
We seek to attract as many as 10 Hutchinson Environ-
mental Postdoctoral Fellows in the summer and fall of
2020. Cohorts of postdoctoral fellows, representing mul-
tiple disciplines, will be centered around the two broad
themes outlined below: Environment and Evolution,
and Climate and Greenhouse Gases. The Hutchinson
Fellows will share space in the Osborn Memorial Lab-
oratories on Yale's Science Hill. Postdoc cohorts will
engage in research and synthesis activities with a net-
work of Yale faculty mentors spanning multiple schools
and departments. Priority will be given to applicants
whose research incorporates data-driven synthesis, mod-
eling, and/or conceptual unication of knowledge as a
means to address these core themes. These are two-
year postdoctoral fellowships (contingent on success in
year one) with a starting salary of $62,000, plus $10,000
for research and travel. Funds will also be available
to support cohort projects, symposia, workshops, and
training in science communication. THEME I Environ-
ment and Evolution. Human-accelerated environmental
changes are aecting the ux of energy and nutrients in
ecosystems, in many cases by altering the structure and
function of species interactions. We are seeking candi-
dates whose research addresses how species interactions
are reshaped by ecological and evolutionary responses
to environmental change and/or how this reshaping
determines processes and patterns at larger scales. Suc-
cessful applicants will work in a highly collaborative
environment around themes including, but not limited
to: (1) eco-evolutionary dynamics in ecosystems driven
by human-accelerated change; (2) the genomic basis
of evolving species interactions; and (3) contemporary
eects of environmental change from a paleoecological
perspective. Faculty lead for Theme I: David Vasseur,
Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. Other
relevant faculty are aliated with the Yale School of
Forestry & Environmental Studies, and the Depart-
ments of Geology & Geophysics and Anthropology. See
yibs.yale.edu/hutchinsonfellowship for additional details
and aliated faculty. THEME II Climate and Green-
house Gases. Atmospheric levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O
are increasing, leading to planetary warming. We are
seeking candidates whose research can contribute to our
general understanding of the generation and manage-
ment of greenhouse gases (GHG). Because of growing
interest in global methane among a group of Yale fac-
ulty, we are particularly interested in building a cohortJanuary 1, 2020 EvolDir 139
of postdoctoral fellows who can advance knowledge of
the production and control of CH4 losses from natu-
ral and human-managed systems. Successful applicants
will work in a highly collaborative environment around
themes including, but not limited to: (1) GHG uxes
from ecosystems and the energy sector; (2) microbial
ecology and evolution relevant to GHGs; (3) GHG path-
ways in plants; (4) GHG dynamics in deep time; and
(5) natural climate solutions. Faculty lead for Theme II:
Peter Raymond, Yale School of Forestry & Environmen-
tal Studies. Other relevant faculty are aliated with
the Departments of Geology & Geophysics, Ecology &
Evolutionary Biology, Chemical & Environmental En-
gineering, and the Yale School of Management. See
yibs.yale.edu/hutchinson-fellowship for additional de-
tails and aliated faculty. APPLICATIONS. Interested
candidates should have, or will soon receive, a Ph.D. in
a relevant discipline. Applications must be submitted
by Monday, January 13, 2020. Submit a CV (with a
complete bibliography), the names and email addressesof three references, and a research statement detailing
potential connections to one (or both) of the themes de-
scribed above; please also identify one or more potential
Yale faculty mentors. Applications should be submitted
to http://apply.interfolio.com/71435. Applicants will
be notied of the results of the selection process by mid-
February 2020. Yale University considers applicants for
employment without regard to, and does not discrim-
inate on the basis of, an individual's sex, race, color,
religion, age, disability, status as a veteran, or national
or ethnic origin; nor does Yale discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.

Berlin EukaryoticMetabarcoding
Feb3-7
Dear all,
last 6 places left on the Physalia course on Eukaryotic
Metabarcoding with Dr. Vasco Elbrecht (Zoological Re-
search Museum Alexander, Bonn, Germany) and Daniel
Marquina (Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Swe-
den)
When: 3-7 February
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
Overview:
This course gives an overview of metabarcoding proce-
dures with an emphasis on practical problem-solving and
hands-on work using analysis pipelines on real datasets.
After completing the course, students should be in a
position to (1) understand the potential and capabilities
of metabarcoding, (2) run complete analyses of metabar-
coding pipelines and obtain diversity inventories and
ecologically interpretable data from raw next-generation
sequence data and (3) design their own metabarcoding
projects, including bioinformatic data analysis and plan-
ning of laboratory work. All course materials (including
copies of presentations, practical exercises, data les,
and example scripts prepared by the instructing team)
will be provided electronically to participants.
Intended audience
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research and at researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing com-
munity of metabarcoders worldwide. This workshop
will review mostly techniques and software useful for
eukaryotic metabarcoding. Other workshops focused on
procedures currently used in microbial metabarcoding
will be available from Physalia-courses.142 EvolDir January 1, 2020
Teaching format
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours
of practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's
discretion.
Assumed background
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments, with some
ssh connections to remote servers. For Windows users,
a virtual box running Linux under Windows and/or
the installation of an ssh client (e.g. PuTTY) will be
needed. For MacOSX systems, installation of some ad-
ditional Python packages might be needed for running
the OBITools software suite. The syllabus has been
planned for people which have some previous experience
running simple commands from a terminal in Linux or
Mac and using the R environment (preferently RStudio)
for performing basic plots and statistical procedures.
You will need to have a laptop with Python 2.7 installed
for running OBITools, but no experience with Python
is necessary. If in doubt, take a look at the detailed
session content below or contact us.

les through appropriate bioinformatic methods and ap-
proaches for subsequent integrative statistical analyses.
Participants are invited to bring their own data to the
practical session on the nal day or can use publicly
available data from the Integrative Human Microbiome
Project (HMP2).
Format
This course is designed for researchers and students with
interest in using culture-independent molecular data
(particularly DNA and RNA sequencing technologies)
to study microbial communities. This includes both the
human microbiome in population studies and techniques
generalizable to any microbial communities. The course
will mainly focus on the analysis of meta'omic sequenc-
ing, including workows for processing raw sequencing
data, multivariate analysis of microbial proles, and
visualization techniques.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background
in microbiology and/or bioinformatics. Programming
experience is advantageous but not required, and a basic
introduction to UNIX-based command line applications
and R will be provided. All labs/tutorials will be run
using pre-built cloud instances provided to students.
Statistical analyses and visualizations will also be run
in R using RStudio.
Learning outcomes
Familiarity with the goals of typical microbial commu-
nity studies and common culture-independent molecular
technologies used to assay them. Metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic data analysis for taxonomic, func-
tional, and strain-level characterization of communities
using reproducible workows. Learning how to perform
multivariate statistical analyses, combine multiple mea-surement types in microbial communities, and how to
visualize associated results. Experience in integrative
multi'omics analysis for large sets of human microbiome
or environmental microbial community populations.

We are very excited to announce the fourth edition of
the EMBO practical course in population genomics: this
year there will be added emphasis on programming and
machine learning applied to population genomics. The
link to the course page is: http://meetings.embo.org/-
event/20-populationgenomics This EMBO Practical
Course will cover coalescent theory, the eect of de-
mography in space and time, genetic clustering, the
detection and quantication of admixture and selec-
tion. Lectures on these topics will be complemented by
hands-on computer practicals introducing a wide range
of software packages, both in R and Python.
This course is aimed at evolutionary biologists who al-
ready have basic bioinformatics skills. A main criterion
for selection will be how much a candidate can benet

Switzerland TamingTheBEAST
May31-Jun5
Dear colleagues,
We are happy to announce that registration is now open
for the June 2020 edition of our summer school, \Taming
the BEAST".
Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in
modern biology. Phylogenetic inferences reconstruct the
evolutionary relationships between organisms, whereas
phylodynamic inferences reveal the dynamics that lead
to the observed relationships. These two elds have
many practical applications in disciplines such as epi-
demiology, developmental biology, paleontology, ecology
and even linguistics. However, phylogenetics and phylo-
dynamics are complex and fast-evolving elds. As such,
inference tools are not easily accessible to researchers
who are not from a computational background.
Taming the BEAST is a summer school focusing on the
BEAST 2 software and consisting of a mix of invited
talks, lectures and hands-on tutorials by leading and
renowned experts in the eld (including several of the
core developers of BEAST 2). The aim of this summer
school is to equip participants with the skills necessary
to condently perform their own phylogenetic and phylo-
dynamic inferences in Bayesian settings, while providing
them with a rm grasp of the theory behind those in-
ferences. Participants are also highly encouraged to
bring their own datasets along and to engage with the
organisers and speakers to address any problems specic
to their own datasets/analyses.
REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN. We welcome applica-
tions from graduate students and early-career scientists
in the life sciences. Preference will be given to appli-
cants who are not from a computational background
and applicants who have already collected/assembled a
dataset that they need to analyze.
Invited speakers:
Alexei Drummond (University of Auckland) Tanja
Stadler (ETH Zurich) Remco Bouckaert (University
of Auckland) Denise Kuehnert (Max Planck Institute)Dates: May 31 to June 5, 2020 (Deadline for registration
is March 1).

Jan22
Call for participation in the 1st Lisbon Area RADCamp
workshop presented by cE3c at the University of Lisbon.
This one day workshop is designed to guide participants
through the full bioinformatic processing of RADSeq
data, taking raw data all the way through downstream
analysis. We will introduce RADseq assembly in ipyrad
( https://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/), phylogenetic and pop-
ulation genetic methods, high performance computing,
basic unix command line and python programming, and
jupyter notebooks to promote reproducible science. We
will make extensive use of the ipyrad 'analysis' API
which provides a powerful, simple, and reproducible
interface to several widely used methods for inferring
phylogenetic relationships, population structure, and
admixture.
This workshop is geared toward practicing empirical
biologists, so no previous experience with command line
interface or bioinformatics is required. The workshop
will be presented over the course of one full day (January
22, 2020) at the University of Lisbon. The preliminary
schedule is available on the RADCamp website.
This workshop is free, but registration is mandatory.
Participation will be limited to 32 individuals. Regis-

WoodsHole MolecularEvolution
May31-Jun10
The 2020 Workshop on Molecular Evolution at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mas-sachusetts, USA, will be held *** MAY 31 to JUNE 10
*** (note that this is earlier than past years).
Founded in 1988, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution
is the longest-running workshop of its kind. The Work-
shop is the premier program for integrating the meth-
ods, theory, and applications of molecular phylogenetics,
statistical genetics, molecular evolution, and related
disciplines. Students work closely with internationally-
recognized scientists, receiving (i) high-level instruction
in the principles of molecular evolution, phylogenetic in-
ference, and evolutionary genomics, (ii) advanced train-
ing in statistical methods best suited to modern datasets,
and (iii) hands-on experience with the latest software
tools (often from the authors of the programs they are
using). The material is delivered via lectures, discus-
sions, and bioinformatic exercises motivated by contem-
porary topics in molecular evolution. A hallmark of this
workshop is the direct interaction between students and
eld-leading scientists. The workshop serves graduate
students, postdocs, and established faculty from around
the world seeking to apply the principles of molecular
evolution to questions of both basic and applied biologi-
cal sciences. A priority of this workshop is to foster an
environment where students can learn from each other
as well from the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to use
the following software to address questions concerning
the origins, maintenance, and function of molecular vari-
ation: ASTRAL, BEST, FASTA, FigTree, IQTree, MI-
GRATE, MAFFT, MP-EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML,
PAUP*, SVD Quartets, and SNaQ. Students will have
the opportunity to work with software on their own
laptops as well as receive training on how to use the
same programs on a computer cluster.
In 2020 the course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joe
Bielawski, Jeremy Brown, Minh Bui, Belinda Chang,
Scott Edwards, Deise Gon calves, Kelley Harris, Tracy
Heath, John Huelsenbeck, Lacey Knowles, Laura Ku-

this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
