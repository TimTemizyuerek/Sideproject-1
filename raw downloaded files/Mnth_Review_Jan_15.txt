logenomics, community & ecosystem genomics, genetic
and ecological networks, methods & non-model organ-
isms, genomics & animal behavior, and applications of
ecological and evolutionary genomics, will highlight how
biodiversity can be used to illuminate complex biologi-
cal relationships and inform ecological and evolutionary
processes and molecular mechanisms of adaptation to
changing environments. The conference will also feature
emerging approaches and technologies to aid further
exploration of the genomes from organisms that span
the tree of life. Gordon Conferences are famous for
fostering in depth interactions that yield new insights
in a collegial atmosphere.

Cairns Australia
ReproductiveConict Aug
Dear colleagues, For those interested in conict as it
pertains to reproduction, I am pleased to announce a
symposium that will be held at the Behaviour2015 con-
ference in Cairns, Australia, in August 2015. Abstracts
are due March 15 2015.
Please see below for details:
COSTS AND CONFLICTS IN REPRODUCTION Niko-
lai Tatarnic1, Leigh W Simmons2 1. Western Australian
Museum, Welshpool, WA, Australia 2. Centre for Evo-
lutionary Biology, The University of Western Australia,
Perth, WA, Australia
Conict between individuals is ubiquitous in nature,
and stems from costs incurred by one or more players
in an interaction when their optima do not align. Self-
promotion and cost avoidance help to shape all manner
of behavioural interactions X including those associated
with reproduction. Conict can manifest among mem-
bers of the same sex (e.g., male-male sperm competition,
queen/worker conict), or between the sexes, where thereproductive optima of females and males dier (sexual
conict). Additionally, when species with poor mate
recognition systems occur sympatrically, interspecies
interactions may also impose signicant costs to one or
both players (reproductive interference). This sympo-
sium aims to focus on dierent facets of antagonism in
the context of reproduction, to gain insights into conict
and conict resolution gleaned from dierent perspec-
tives and across hierarchical levels (i.e., within sexes,
between sexes, between populations, between species).
For further information, please contact Nik Tatarnic for
details (nikolai.tatarnic@museum.wa.gov.au).

CSIC, Sevilla, Spain Co-organizer: Dr. Ovidiu Paun
<ovidiu.paun@univie.ac.at >Department for Botany
and Biodiversity Research, University of Vienna, Aus-
triaSummary During the last two decades it has become in-
creasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms, that do not
aect the nucleotide sequence of the genome but regulate
gene expression, can cause new phenotypes (epilalleles).
Frequently altered by environmental stimuli epigenetic
marks can be transmitted from one generation of or-
ganisms to the next throughout the germline. Studies
focused on model organisms have showed that cyto-
sine DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark,
whose de novo formation and maintenance involves dif-
ferent enzymes, histone modication and RNAs. New
developments are expected in the eld of molecular epi-
genetics that will clarify some controversial issues such
as the maintenance for multiple generations in absence of
the environmental disruption and the potential genetic
basis of epigenetic variation.
However, to unravel the role of epigenetics in adapta-
tion and evolution it is now essential to analyze in a
real-world context the magnitude of and environmental
eects on epigenetic variance, the correlates with indi-
vidual tness, and the inheritance of epigenetic signals
(Population Epigenetics), as well as their possible ef-
fects on speciation, diversication rate and appearance
of evolutionary novelty (Macroevolutionary Epigenetics).
This symposium seeks to join evolutionary ecologists,
botanists and zoologists, and geneticists working with
natural populations to contribute to this end.

Deadline for Abstract submission is January 10th, 2015
Genomics of Local Adaptation
The study of how organisms adapt to dierent environ-
ments is one of the major challenges in evolutionary
biology. Recent genome and transcriptome sequencing
has allowed fast progress in our understanding of the
genomic signatures of local adaptation, including the ge-
netic architecture of tness traits, and the identication
of ecologically-relevant gene variation. Genome-wide
molecular studies have addressed classical questions on
local adaptation, such as the role of new mutation vs.
standing variation or the geographical distribution of
adaptive polymorphisms. They are also starting to pro-
duce the empirical information needed to assess the
potential for evolutionary responses of keystone plants
and animals in the face of impending climate change, a
major societal concern, and to push forward the eld
from mostly descriptive studies towards the construction
of prediction models. Recently, genome-wide studies
have also produced detailed knowledge on covariance of
allelic eects and adaptive gene networks. Nevertheless,
ecological genomic studies of local adaptation also bring
about new challenges related to sampling issues, the
production of reliable genomic data in many individuals,
the analysis of large and particularly complex datasets,
and the understanding of the limitations associated with
these analyses. This Symposium will welcome original
research in model and non-model species as well as the
presentation of novel methodological approaches.

ESEB SYMPOSIUM ON GENES AND ALLELES UN-
DERLYING ADAPTATION
Dear Colleagues:
The abstract submission deadline (10 January 2015) for
ESEB in Lausanne is approaching fast.
We would like to invite you to contribute to the ESEB
symposium
'HOW TO IDENTIFY AND TEST THE LOCI AND
ALLELES UNDERLYING ADAPTATION?'
which will take place at the 15th Congress of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in
Lausanne, Switzerland, 10 - 14 August 2015 (http://-
www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/)
INVITED SPEAKERS: - Felicity Jones (Friedrich Mi-
escher Laboratory, Max Planck Institute, T ubingen,
Germany) - Alistair McGregor (Oxford Brookes Univer-
sity, Oxford, UK)
ORGANIZERS: - Paul Schmidt (University of Pennsyl-
vania) - Thomas Flatt (University of Lausanne)
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: To understand the
mechanisms underlying adaptation, causal molecular
variants, genes and pathways must be identied, charac-
terized and ultimately experimentally veried. To this
end, various methods for outlier detection, QTL map-
ping, and association studies have provided a wealth
of 'candidates' for phenotypes of interest, the response
to articial and natural selection, and adaptive dier-
entiation within and among taxa. Recent advances
in whole-genome sequencing allow an unprecedented,
comprehensive evaluation of genotype-phenotype asso-
ciations. However, one major issue with whole-genome
screens is whether any given 'candidate' actually rep-
resents a true positive: population structure and de-
mography, the number of independent chromosomes,
statistical power, and other complications are known
to generate false positives. Thus, one of the emerging
challenges in evolutionary genomics is to unambiguously
identify and empirically validate candidates identied
in omics-level screens. The goal of our symposium is toJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 9
discuss and showcase how to best identify and validate
candidate variants, genes, and pathways. Specically,
the symposium aims to (1) evaluate methods by which
candidates are identied and investigated; (2) generate
discussion regarding the signicance of functional valida-
tion of identied candidates in quantitative, ecological
and evolutionary genetics; and (3) present some of the
best current research related to functional identication
and validation.
WEBSITE (see symposium no. 18): http://-
www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/symposium list/ The
site for registration for the ESEB meeting and for ab-
stract submission for this symposium is now open at:
http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/ DEADLINE for
abstract submission for contributed talks and posters:
10 January 2015.
We are interested in receiving abstract submissions re-
porting studies that seek to identify AND validate eco-
logically and evolutionarily relevant phenotypic eects of
candidate genes and alleles in the wild or the laboratory.
Abstracts will be evaluated by the symposium organizers
and will be selected for either oral or poster presenta-
tion by early March. When submitting your abstract
please state your preference (talk, poster) during the
submission process. Submitted talks will be 17 min
each, including discussion, plus 3 min to change rooms.
The overall time window allotted to each symposium
will be decided by the congress committee, depending
on the number and quality of submissions.
We are looking forward to seeing you in beautiful Lau-
sanne!

NextGenerationPhylodynamics
Aug10-14
Dear colleagues,
we're happy to announce the symposium \Next-generation phylodynamics" at the ESEB 2015 conference
(August 10-14) in Lausanne, Switzerland (details be-
low). We're looking forward to receive exciting abstracts
(deadline Jan 10, 2015, http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/-
eseb2015/abstract-submission/) from which we can put
together a great symposium program.
Please forward to anybody interested! Best wishes,

Next-generation phylodynamics Tanja Stadler http:/-
/www.bsse.ethz.ch/cevo Alexei Drummond http://-
compevol.auckland.ac.nz/dr-alexei-drummond/ The
term phylodynamics was coined in the early 2000's to
highlight host-pathogen systems in which evolutionary,
epidemiological and immunological processes interact
because they proceed on the same time scale. Such
interaction is in particular observable for fast-evolving
pathogens including RNA viruses and bacteria. When
this is the case genomic sequence data sampled from
pathogen populations contains a ngerprint of the pro-
cesses that acted in the past ' namely the evolutionary,
epidemiological and immunological dynamics. Recent
advances in next-generation sequencing technology pro-
vide the required data for phylodynamic analysis using
pathogen and host data. The development of phylody-
namic inference methods relies on models that reconcile
evolutionary, epidemiological and immunological dynam-
ics. This then allows the quantication of fundamental
parameters using genomic sequence data. This sympo-
sium aims to bring together scientists working on both
theoretical and experimental aspects of phylodynamics.
We envision a mix of people working on computational
method development, experimental host-pathogen sys-
tems and empirical eld studies to exchange the latest
developments in the eld of phylodynamics. Such a
symposium will foster the identication of key future
challenges to improve our understanding of the spread
of pathogens in host populations.

ABOUT PROTOLANG The Protolang conference se-
ries creates an interdisciplinary platform for scholarly
discussion on the origins of symbolic communication
distinctive of human beings. The thematic focus of
Protolang is on delineating the genetic, anatomical,
neuro-cognitive, socio-cultural, semiotic, symbolic and
ecological requirements for evolving (proto)language.
Sign use, tools, cooperative breeding, pointing, vocali-
sation, intersubjectivity, bodily mimesis, planning and
navigation are among many examples of such possible
factors through which hominins have gained a degree
of specicity that is not found in other forms of animal
communication and cognition. We aim at identifying
the proximate and ultimate causes as well as the mech-
anisms by which these requirements evolved; evaluating
the methodologies, research tools and simulation tech-
niques; and enabling extended and vigorous exchange
of ideas across disciplinary borders.We invite scholars
from A(rcheology) to Z(oology), and all disciplines in
between, to contribute data, experimental and theoreti-
cal research, and look forward to welcoming you at one
of our conferences!

GENETIC TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COORDINA-
TION NETWORK June 17, 2015 (Wednesday morning
and afternoon) Robust protocols to manipulate genes
and genomes have not yet been developed for most
insects other than Drosophila melanogaster, and this
shortfall is limiting research progress in many aspects of
arthropod genomics. The NSF-RCN on Insect Genetic
Technologies (IGTRCN: 2014-2019; igtrcn.org) seeks to
remedy this problem by facilitating the communication
of best practice and new techniques among arthropod
genomicists.
This IGTRCN-sponsored workshop will comprise (1)
talks that showcase the latest genetic technologies, and
(2) discussion sessions for exchange of ideas and solutions
for eective insect genetic engineering. Proposals from
the workshop will be integrated into the IGTRCN pro-
gram of hands-on practical workshops, fellowships, and
the IGTRCN KnowledgeBase. Early-career researchers
are particularly encouraged to present their research at
this workshop.

Aim of the meetingNext Generation Sequencing (NGS)
has been a driving force in the eld of evolutionary
biology, providing opportunities to reveal the genetic
architecture of adaptive traits in a wide range of organ-
isms. This exciting advance in technology has produced
considerable impetus to develop methods and tools for
data analysis and to extend theoretical foundations for
modelling adaptive events. To produce a detailed under-
standing of adaptive processes, well-designed studies and
sample collection, evolutionary models of adaptation,
and statistical models to detect the genomic signatures
of biological adaptation are all necessary. This workshop
brings together evolutionary biologists along the empir-
ical to theoretical continuum to exchange ideas and
perspectives in a relaxed atmosphere.Keynote speakers

UMichigan SSB Standalone Meeting
May20-22
*Society of Systematic Biologists Stand-alone meeting
2015*
Please join us for the upcoming stand-alone meeting of
the Society of Systematic Biologists, May 20-22, 2015,
to be held at the University of Michigan.
This meeting is being oered to complement the joint
meeting of American Society of Naturalists (ASN), So-
ciety for the Study of Evolution (SSE), and the Society
of Systematic Biologists (SSB) in June, by oering a
setting and organizational structure conducive to one-on-
one interactions and in depth discussions. In addition to
attending panel discussions, hackathons, tutorials and
workshops, participants are invited to give a lightening
talk (i.e., 5 minute presentations: 4 minutes for the talk
and one minute for questions).
Grants-in-aid will be made available for attending the
meeting, and aordable housing will be available via
dorm-rooms on the campus of the University of Michigan.
Details about the schedule, grants, and registration will
be available at http://ssb2015standalone.weebly.com/
.Note that attendance will be capped at 300 participants
so register early (registration opens in January).
The workshop topics1 include:
- - Macroevolutionary dynamics on phylogenies - - Open
Access to phylogenetic data - - Comparative methods
- - Biogeography - - Species-tree estimation from SNPs
to sequences - - Interrogating transcriptomic data from
processing to analysis - - Estimating divergence times -
- Phylodynamics
1Note that these workshops are in addition to a Sym-
posium and Software School that will be oered as a
pre-meeting workshop by Tandy Warnow (as described
below).
Topics for debate:- - The concept of \species" is outdated and hinders
progress in ecology/evolution/systematics - - Molecular
dates are reliable/molecular dates are unreliable - - Is
more data better in phylogenetics - - Phylogenetic com-
parative methods are ultimately bound to fail because
they cannot capture the complex evolutionary processes
that shape phylogenies
2Panel discussions will involve two short presentations of
opposing viewpoints on each topic followed by a debate
with audience participation.
Pre-meeting workshop, May 18-19:
A Symposium and Software School focusing on New
Methods for Phylogenomics and Metagenomics will be
held on May 18-19, immediately preceding the stan-
dalone meeting at the University of Michigan. The sym-
posium will cover new methods for multiple sequence
alignments, genome-scale species tree estimation, phy-
logenetic network estimation, and metagenomic taxon
identication. The software school will include hands-on
tutorials in new methods, and taught by the develop-
ers of the software. No fee will be charged, and travel
awards of up to $500 per person are available. Please
see http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/symposium-2015.html

Ventura California Speciation
Mar15-20
Last call - GRC conference SPECIATION 2015
Dear colleagues,
A few places are still available for SPECIATION 2015,
a new Gordon Research Conference (GRC) devoted en-
tirely to speciation research, which will be held from
March 15 to 20, 2015, at the Four Points Sheraton
Harbor Resort in the beautiful coastal city of Ventura,
California. The conference will be the world's largest on
speciation research and will feature an unprecedented
mosaic of interrelated talks by invited researchers, as
detailed in the conference program appended below.
The GRC conferences on speciation, of which this will
be the very rst, will raise to a trans-Atlantic level
a tradition of international conferences on speciation
research that has been initiated by the European Re-
search Networking Programme 'Frontiers of Speciation
Research'. The two conferences that have been heldJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 19
so far, SPECIATION 2010 and SPECIATION 2013,
helped facilitate bridge-building between disparate ap-
proaches to speciation research and attracted more than
150 participants on each occasion.
SPECIATION 2015 will continue this tradition of sci-
entic bridge-building and promote integrative perspec-
tives that interface empirical insights with theoretical
advances and bring together developments in ecology,
systematics, and genetics. Reecting the aims of the
GRC conference series, and committed to a pluralistic
perspective on the eld, we have selected invited scien-
tists based on their complementary expertise in dierent
areas of speciation research. In this way, the conference
will provide a platform for comparing and orchestrating
dierent approaches to speciation research.
In addition to about 30 invited presentations, the con-
ference will prominently feature a rich poster session, as
well as selected poster introductions. The topics that
will be covered at the conference include the biodiver-
sity crisis, mechanisms of reproductive isolation, genetic
constraints, ecological drivers, genomic signatures, be-
havioral mechanisms, species cohesion, hybrid zones,
macro-ecological explanations, as well as integrative and
synthetic perspectives on speciation. Each of a total
of nine conference sessions will feature 3 or 4 invited
presentations, with ample time for discussion.
Registration is open at http://www.grc.org/-
programs.aspx?id=16902 until the few remaining
open slots have been completely lled.
With many thanks and best wishes,

BrighamYoungU PlantEvoDevo
Two PhD graduate student positions in the evolution
of plant development are available beginning Fall 2015
in the Whipple lab, Department of Biology, Brigham
Young University. Research interests in the Whipple lab
center on the genetic basis of morphological diversity
in plants, with a focus on both model and non-model
systems (see whipplelab.byu.edu). Students will em-
ploy molecular, morphological and genetic approaches
to address basic questions in the evolution of plant devel-
opment. Specic research projects include comparative
ower and inorescence development in both grasses
(Poaceae) and Gilia (Polemoniaceae).
Successful applicants will be highly motivated with
a strong interest in plant development, and demon-

We announce the availability of a NERC Doctoral
Training Partnership opportunity (PhD studentship)
held jointly between the British Antarctic Survey
and Bristol University (through the GW4+ scheme
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/gw4plusdtp/programme/), to
commence in autumn 2015. Students are eligible for
full funding if they are a UK citizen or EU national
who has been resident in the UK for three years at

Resolving the evolutionary history of a Southern Ocean
\hotspot" family: the philobryid bivalves
The Southern Ocean (SO) is a unique and iso-
lated marine habitat, with over-deepened continental
shelves, oceanography strongly inuenced by the circum-
Antarctic current and a low-temperature, stenothermal
environment hosting a vast number of endemic and un-
usual species. The recent Census of Antarctic Marine
increased the knowledge on known species and their
biogeographic distributions but for most taxa, South-
ern Ocean diversity is still greatly underestimated. The
Philobryidae (Bivalvia: Arcoida) are with 13 species one
of the most speciose marine bivalve families in the SO,
cover a depth range from the intertidal to the abyssal
zone and have their global diversity hotspot in the SO.
Previous genetic work on this family has been extremely
limited.
Despite this diversity, the genetic relationships and shell
morphology of this family are poorly known, possibly
due to their small size ( <1.5cm). This project will
assess the evolutionary history of the Southern Ocean
Philobryidae and how past climate change and conti-
nental drift has inuenced their species diversication.
Preliminary molecular work has identied a number
of cryptic species within nominal species of the gen-
era *Adacnarca* and *Philobrya* from dierent loca-
tions and depth in the Southern Ocean, suggesting that
even described species require investigation in terms
of species limits, using genetics and morphology. The
British Antarctic Survey holds extensive collections of
Southern Ocean philobryids, including representatives of
all described Southern Ocean species. The student will
link genetic and material property tools to (i) determinethe phylogenetic relationships within Southern Hemi-
sphere Phylobryidae, particularly focusing on Antarctic
taxa, using multiple mitochondrial and nuclear loci and
placing this into broader context within the superfamily
Arcoidea, (ii) measure the patterns of divergence and ra-
diation of Philobryidae within the Southern Ocean, (iii)
examine morphological and material property variation
between species, and (iv) conduct population genetic
analysis of population history for selected philobryid
species.
This studentship will include a genetic laboratory com-
ponent, sequencing multiple nuclear and mitochondrial
genetic loci to investigate phylogenetic relationships, and
conducting ddRAD-seq and subsequent genomic analy-
sis to investigate population structuring within selected
taxa. They will also perform morphometric analysis,
and conduct high resolution chemical and structural
mapping using Electron Microprobe Analysis, Atomic
force microscopy, and Electron Backscatter Diraction,
to characterise the shells. The analytical skills devel-
oped in this studentship are highly transferable to a
wide range of jobs. The student will get a solid overview
of marine ecology, genetics, bioinformatics, in-situ chem-
ical and structural analysis. The student will be part
of the vibrant Palaeobiology group at Bristol and the
world leading Research Team at BAS.
Applicants should possess a degree (II.1 mini-
mum)/higher degree in a relevant subject. Experience
of invertebrate biology, appropriate molecular and data
analysis techniques and polar marine ecosystems are
advantageous.
The studentship is expected to last 3.5 years from Octo-
ber 2015, subject to NERC funding. To apply for this
studentship, please send an expression of interest, CV
and names and contact details for two referees to jen-
nifer.jackson@bas.ac.uk by 3rd January 2015. Primary
supervisors are Dr Katrin Linse of the British Antarctic
Survey and Dr Daniela Schmidt of the University of
Bristol, with Dr Jennifer Jackson of the British Antarc-
tic Survey co-supervising. For more about the GW4+

rural livelihoods
In a recently approved international research project
funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation
(SNSF) and the Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation (SDC), we aim to help mitigate the eects
of woody invasive alien species (IAS) on biodiversity,
ecosystem services and human well-being in case study
areas in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. To achieve this
goal, we will generate and share knowledge on invasion
processes and on context-dependent eects of woody
IAS. Also, we will elaborate sustainable control measures
and develop and document Sustainable Land Manage-
ment (SLM) strategies that mitigate the negative eects
of woody IAS in East Africa.
Within this project, an exciting PhD position is avail-
able at CABI in Switzerland (cabi.org/about-cabi/cabi-
centres/Switzerland), which is the coordinator of this
project. The PhD aims to improve our understanding
of the positive and negative eects of key woody IAS on
biodiversity, ecosystem services and rural livelihoods in
three case study areas in East Africa. Specic goals of
the study include: (1) measure eects of selected woody
IAS at small scale, e.g. at the household or community
level, and (2) compare IAS cover - eect response curves
for multiple indicators of biodiversity, ES and rural
livelihood. The results from this study will be combined
with those from parallel studies assessing the current
and potential future distribution and abundance of the
woody IAS in the case study areas and at the national
level, which will allow us to assess the impact of woody
IAS across multiple spatial scales. The student will be
based at the CABI Centre in Del emont, Switzerland,
and registered at a Swiss University. Extended eld-
work will be conducted in the East Usambara mountains
(Tanzania), the Baringo district (Kenya) and the Afar
Region (Ethiopia).

Research Training Group RESPONSE: 12 open Ph.D.
positions
The Research Training Group \Biological responses
to novel and changing environments " RESPONSE\
(RTG 2010), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemein-
schaft (DFG), invites applications for 12 Ph.D. positions
(salary scale TV-L E13, 65 %; including social benets)
for a three-year structured Ph.D. program. Start of
the program and all respective Ph.D. positions will be
April 1st, 2015. The RTG is based at the University of
Greifswald, Germany (www.uni-greifswald.de).
Research Program
The ability to respond to novel and changing environ-24 EvolDir January 1, 2015
mental conditions, either by phenotypic plasticity, ge-
netic adaptation, or range shifts, is pivotal to the longer-
term survival of all organisms. Owing to increasing con-
cerns about the consequences of human-induced global
change, such responses have attracted increasing interest
in recent years. RESPONSE focuses on the plastic and
genetic capacities for in situ responses (cluster A) and
on the factors limiting or facilitating dispersal to new
habitats (cluster B). The RTG aims at deepening our
understanding of the limits to population persistence,
enabling more accurate predictions regarding the fate
of populations under changing conditions. Our research
program spans dierent levels of biological organization,
ranging from molecular and physiological mechanisms
to ecological population-level responses, and a wide vari-
ety of organisms including myxomycetes, plants (trees),
and animals (snails, crustaceans, insects, spiders, bats).
Please refer to www.uni-greifswald.de/RESPONSE [1]
for further information, especially on the available indi-
vidual research (= Ph.D.) projects and specic require-
ments. Note that all projects involve eld work at least
to some extent.
Teaching Concept
A teaching program accompanies the interdisciplinary
research strategy. It covers dierent scientic topics
and techniques relevant to the RTG as well as soft skills
relevant to career development, and includes summer
schools, journal clubs, practical courses, lectures, and in-
dividualized educational as well as mentoring programs.
Each Ph.D. project involves visiting stays at dierent
laboratories, partly abroad. The participation in the
teaching program is mandatory.
Requirements
We invite applications from highly motivated candidates
with above-average qualications, passion for and ex-
perience in research, and the willingness to actively
participate in the RTG. Successful applicants will (1)
hold a M.Sc. degree (or equivalent) in Biology or an-
other relevant discipline, (2) have a solid background in
ecology and evolution, (3) experience with methods and
/ or organisms relevant to the RTG, (4) an excellent
command of the English language, which will be the of-
cial language of the RTG, and (5) will be motivated to
join an interdisciplinary research training environment.

EmergingModelGenomics
PhD fellowship (3 years, similar to http://-
education.gov.au/australian-postgraduate-awards
but internationals welcome):
As part of a new lab focused on the genome bioinfor-
matics of emerging model species from plants, animals
(especially arthropods) and microbes, Im seeking an
exceptional candidate to take up a PhD scholarship on
one of two topics: i) informatic methods for emerging
model species, ii) the genetics of ecological adaptations.
There is no xed project descriptions (but see below)
as Im a believer of the US model for post-QUALs PhD
projects. Having said that, proposals that match my
skills, research interests and current/future grants are
more likely to receive support and lead to a successful
graduation. Bonus points if the proposal can be readilyJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 25
couched in biosecurity or climate adaptation outcomes.
International candidates are encouraged to apply as are
candidates with strong molecular or evolutionary skills
who wish to develop their informatics skills but bring
something else on the table. Candidates are expected
to give a broad outline of a proposed project (their own
interest or pick one from below). Note that experiments
ought to be feasible within the three years of the fellow-
ship and double note that in Australia we have a strong
commitment to work/life balance.
The following projects topics are of core interest (read:
more likely to have a good research budget).
Bioinformatic methods for (eukaryotic) comparative ge-
nomics (suitable for a computer scientist or those inter-
ested in software engineering):
1) The development of novel informatics approaches for
annotation using NGS experimental data. For example
Trinity RNA-Seq or Just Annotate My Proteins. A
particular challenge is the analysis and ecient interro-
gation of population variants.
2) New approaches to visualise and interact with spa-
tially and temporarily distributed population genetic
data (GeoGenetics) in the face of huge amounts of data.
I'm most interested in interactive data analytics and
browser-based technologies that will empower our col-
laborators.
Wet-lab and entomological projects (with NGS):
3) Insect gut microbes and nutrition: building a model
for investigating ecosystem function.
4) The transcriptomic signals of stress response and cell
death in the Mediterranean and Queensland fruit ies
(Tephridae:Ceratitis and Tephridae:Bactrocera).
5) similarly, response to environmental pollutants in
aquatic organisms (with J. Colbourne)
and two topics which would suit those strong in evolu-
tionary theory (with a blend of informatics and experi-
mental work):
6) investigating the molecular basis of adaptations in
Helicoverpa moths, Heliconius butteries or Tephritid
fruit ies
7) using whole genome (re)sequencing to understand
the evolutionary trajectory of genes relating to environ-
mental adaptation
We're heavily embedded in international communi-
ties/collaborations and therefore the successful candi-
date will be supported to travel nationally and interna-
tionally (e.g. UK, Panama, France, Germany, Austria,
Greece, USA).Note: It is a requirement of the fellowship funding body
that you have the equivalent to the Australian rst class
Honours (i.e. at least 6 months of a research project), a
Masters or equivalent research working experience. If
English is not your native language, you will be required
to pass an IELTS exam. Australian citizens who are eli-
gible for an APA, are also welcome to apply and discuss
their research project budget.
Closing Date: I will go through the applications montly,
around the 25th of every month and the position will
remain open until lled.
How to Apply: send a 2 to 3-page CV that includes two
contact details for referees and 1 to 2-page Research
Statement to alexie@butterybase.org
The research environment:
The Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment (HIE) is
a research only institution focused on environmental re-
search. It is one of four Institutes at UWS dedicated to
excellence in research. The HIE is dedicated to answer-
ing crucial questions about impacts of environmental
change on terrestrial ecosystems. Oering comprehen-
sive eld and laboratory based facilities for research from
genes to ecosystems, the Institute encourages collabora-
tions between its three themes: Soil Biology & Genomics;
Plants, Animals & Interactions; and Ecosystem Func-

Institute has over 70 academic and support sta and is
located on the Hawkesbury campus of the University of
Western Sydney (UWS) in Richmond, NSW, Australia.
The institute is highly collaborative and diverse. Based
on its location, candidates who enjoy being the beautiful

Linking morphology and molecular responses of marine
mollusc larvae to climate change
We are looking for a masters student to join the Nunes
lab (IUEM), in collaboration with St ephanie Auzoux-
Bordenave (MNHN), to carry out a placement investi-
gating how temperature and ocean acidication aect
larval development, in terms of both morphology and
underlying gene expression.
As a result of the changing global climate, marine or-
ganisms are increasingly subject to environmental stres-
sors such as rising sea surface temperatures and ocean
acidication. One group of organisms that may be at
particular risk are calcifying mollusc larvae, as elevated
atmospheric CO2 results in reduced carbonate availabil-ity for biomineralization of their calcite shells; however,
eects of environmental change are often taxa specic.
Multispecies comparative approaches are therefore re-
quired to identify shared or divergent responses. This
project will aim to link morphology (via analysis of lar-
val growth and shell development, using transmitted and
polarized light microscopy) with the underlying changes
in gene expression (using Quantitative real-time PCR),
as part of an investigation into the responses among
four mollusc species (Crassostrea gigas, Pecten maximus,
Venerupis philippanarum and Haliotis tuberculata).
The position will start in January/February 2015, and
a stipend of 523 EUR per month will be available for
the 5 month placement.

PhD position \Comparative analysis of sexual selection
in parrots of the world" at the Max Planck Institute for
Ornithology
The department Behavioural Ecology & Evolutionary
Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology
in Seewiesen is looking for a PhD student to study the
link between sexual dimorphism and the complexity of
courtship displays in parrots (Psittaciformes).
The candidate will rst compile a data set containing
information on a variety of behavioural, sexual, and
life-history traits for all parrots of the world based on
literature, existing data, and own observations. These
data will then be analyzed using modern phylogenetic
comparative methods to make inferences about the evo-
lution of these traits. The practical work will take place
at the Loro Parque Foundation on Tenerife, which keeps
the largest parrot collection in the world and maintains
an extensive long-term data base from veterinary stock
control and breeding monitoring.
The position is funded for the duration of 3 years, witha possible one-year extension. A Master's degree in biol-
ogy or equivalent is required. A focus on behavioural or
evolutionary ecology is preferred, but candidates with
a background in comparative cognition, evolutionary
genetics, or ecological physiology are also encouraged
to apply. The project requires the ability to acquire
in-depth knowledge of modern statistical methods in
ecological meta-analysis and phylogenetic comparative
analysis. We are looking for a person who is enthusiastic
and highly motivated to work with captive birds. We
expect the candidate to work in a reliable, structured
and eective manner, and to have good oral and writ-
ten communication skills. Preference will be given to
applicants that previously have conducted behavioural
work and developed skills in data analysis. Ability to
communicate in Spanish is advantageous.
The successful candidate will join a vibrant, interna-
tional group of researchers at an institute focused on re-
search on birds and will have the opportunity to work in
a multidisciplinary setting, in contact with professionals
from an array of elds and institutions. Remuneration
will be according to pay group 13/2 TV oD. We provide
a supportive research and learning environment with
excellent facilities. Working language is English. The

ReproductiveFailure
PhD Position at MPI Ornithology: Evolutionary Ge-
netics of the Embryo Mortality Puzzle in the Zebra
Finch
A PhD position is available at the Max Planck Institute
for Ornithology (MPIO) in Seewiesen (near Munich,January 1, 2015 EvolDir 31
Germany) starting around September 2015 to study the
quantitative and molecular genetics of embryo mortality
in zebra nches.
It is one of the most fundamental puzzles in evolutionary
biology why many animal species show high rates of re-
productive failure despite the fact that natural selection
should be acting against this in every single generation.
For instance, in humans, it is estimated that two out
of three fertilized eggs die before birth, and it is still
not understood why such a wasteful system has evolved.
The case of the zebra nch also represents such a puz-
zle, because we see high rates of embryo mortality that
cannot be attributed to trivial phenomena like environ-
mental eects or inbreeding. The project will combine
the use of various genomic tools and QTL mapping
with setting up specic experimental crosses to identify
and characterize the genetic factors that lead to embryo
mortality. In particular, we will attempt to understand
better the evolution of incompatibility-causing loci and
of selsh genetic elements.
We seek a highly motivated individual who shares our
fascination with this topic and who has a background
or strong interest in some of the following elds: evo-
lutionary biology, quantitative genetics, molecular ge-
netics and statistics. A Master's degree in biology or
equivalent is required. The project primarily involves
handling of extensive data sets of phenotypic and ge-
netic data (breeding records of egg fates, pedigrees,
SNPs, microsatellites, sequence data). Any prior knowl-
edge in using R or Python or any experience in using
bioinformatics tools in a Linux environment would be
advantageous but can also be acquired at a later stage.
Initial appointment will be for three years with a possible
extension for another year subject to research progress.
Payment will be through a Max Planck PhD position
(13/2 TV oD). We provide a supportive research and
learning environment with excellent facilities. Work-
ing language is English. Knowledge of German is not
required.
The successful candidate will become a member of the
International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for
Organismal Biology, a close cooperation between the
Max Planck Institute for Ornithology and the Depart-
ment of Biology of the University of Konstanz. Besides
their own research, the IMPRS fellows attend labora-
tory courses and workshops focussing on statistics and
transferable skills like scientic writing and project man-
agement. Talks by invited speakers during our annual
IMPRS symposium, student retreats, and conference
participation complete the individually tailored curricu-
lum. Each PhD student receives individual supervision
and mentoring and is guided in her/his research workby a PhD advisory committee.
The Max Planck Society is an equal opportunity em-
ployer and encourages disabled persons to apply. The
Society aims at increasing the number of women in
elds where they are underrepresented, and therefore
encourages them to apply.
To apply for this position, it is strongly recommended to
do this via the webpage of the International Max Planck
Research School for Organismal Biology (IMPRS-OB
http://www.orn.mpg.de/2383/Application). Deadline
of application is January 15th, 2015. Interviews with
the applicants are scheduled for Mid-March.
Alternatively, you can send your application as
a single le to our secretary Carmen Dobus
(cdobus@orn.mpg.de). Here, the deadline is the same,
but late applications may potentially be considered.
This le should include a concise statement of research
interests and work experiences relevant to the project,
curriculum vitae and contact details for 2-3 academic
references. In case of such direct application, we would
expect the successful candidate to apply for becoming
an IMPRS student in the following year.

tion skills are essential, and quantitative (incl. computer
programming) skills will be a plus.
Project overview: New mutations play a fundamental
role in adaptive evolutionary change, yet the mutational
architecture of phenotypic and tness variation remains
understudied. In this project, the student will address
key unanswered questions in biology by examining the
evolutionary dynamics and consequences of spontaneous
mutations across the genome. The research will unravel
the unique mutational properties of dierent genomic
regions, as well as the prevalence and distribution of
sex-specic mutational eects across the genome. The
project will involve a combination of empirical research
on Drosophila fruit ies, quantitative analyses of high
throughput datasets (life history and transcriptomic),
and theoretical modelling.
The successful candidate will apply for a scholarship
package through Monash University, which provides atax-free annual stipend (current rate of AUD$25,392
p.a., equaling $973 per fortnight) and full waiver of
tuition fees for the duration of the doctoral program
(for three years). The successful student can further
supplement their annual income by contributing to the
undergraduate teaching classes of Dowling and Connal-
lon, by acting as laboratory class demonstrators and
tutors. All research expenses will be fully covered, as
well as costs associated with all postgraduate coursework
and conference attendance.
Monash University is a member of Australias Group
of Eight coalition, and is internationally recognized for
excellence in research and teaching. The School of Bi-

A 4-year PhD position is available at SLU, Alnarp:
Plant Resistance Ecology: A new tool to engineer bi-
ological control of herbivores Several plant traits are
important for plants' interactions with herbivores and
parasitoids. One very important plant trait is resistance
against herbivores. A general question to investigate is
how herbivore-parasitoid interactions are aected when
resistance in wild plants evolves, and when domestic
plants are bred for increased resistance.
Horticultural plants are often dependent on biological
control of herbivores provided by parasitoids. This
ecosystem service may be aected if resistance increases
or declines during plant breeding. Knowledge regard-
ing such plant eects opens up novel opportunities to
actively breed for improved biocontrol. Similarly, plant
resistance evolution in natural populations may lead to
altered trophic interactions which could aect the level
of herbivory experienced by the plant.
The aim of this PhD project is to investigate how plant
resistance against herbivores aects plant-herbivore-
parasitoid interactions in wild and domesticated straw-
berry. The PhD student will have access to a large
common garden with 100 wild plant genotypes (Fragaria
vesca), and several domesticated varieties (Fragaria x
ananassa, F. vesca, F. viridis, F. moschata), that dier
in their resistance against herbivores.

Conservation genomics: predicting the adaptive poten-
tial of the endangered New Zealand hihi (stitchbird;
*Notiomystis cincta*)
A PhD scholarship, funded by a New Zealand Marsden
Fund Grant, is available with Dr Anna Santure in the
School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland,
New Zealand. This project is an exciting opportunity
to use genomics and statistical genetics approaches to
understand and predict the adaptive potential of the
endangered New Zealand hihi (stitchbird; *Notiomystis
cincta*).
Determining the adaptive potential of wild populations
requires that we understand the genetic basis of traits
that are important for survival and reproduction in these
populations. In this project, we will characterise the
genetic basis of morphological and life history traits in
the reintroduced Tiritiri Matangi Island population of36 EvolDir January 1, 2015
hihi, in order to understand the potential of the species
to respond to changing environmental pressures, includ-
ing anthropogenic climate change. Hihi are an ideal
study system because, in addition to being a wonderful
example of eccentric New Zealand wildlife, a reintro-
duced population of birds on Tiritiri Matangi Island has
been intensively monitored since introduction and we
have a wealth of data on morphological and life history
traits, social and genetic relationships, DNA samples
and environmental variables. The project student will
be responsible for helping to develop a genomic toolkit
for hihi, using this toolkit to determine the genetic basis
of traits in the population using genetic linkage mapping
and association, and investigating genetic trade-os be-
tween traits that may constrain the adaptive potential
of the species.
We are looking for a candidate with a strong background
in statistics, bioinformatics, mathematics, computer pro-
gramming or similar, as well as a passion for genetics,
ecology and conservation biology.
The PhD position requires the applicant to be eligible
for admission to the PhD programme at the University
of Auckland (see https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/-
for/future-postgraduates/how-to-apply-pg/apply-for-a-
doctorate/phd-entry-requirements.html; please note the
English language prociency requirements). Candidates
should ideally have a GPA of 7 or above; international
students are welcome to apply.
This project is a collaboration with Drs Patricia Brekke
and John Ewen at the Institute of Zoology, Zoological So-
ciety of London, see http://www.hihiconservation.com.

UCambridge EvolutionAvianTaste
*PhD on the function and evolution of avian taste with
Hannah Rowland at the University of Cambridge. *
*Importance of the area of research concerned*: Many
animals depend upon their sense of taste to survive.
But our understanding of the molecular basis of taste
is mostly based on mammal studies. It is unclear to
what extent other vertebrates, such as birds, use simi-
lar mechanisms. Genomics and behavioural studies on
the avian sense of taste will address basic questions in
evolutionary biology. Findings can be applied to create
agricultural pest control measures and to formulate diets
for the pet trade or for captive breeding programs.
*Project summary*: The molecular bases of bird olfac-
tion and visionare well understood. In contrast, little
is known about the taste sensitivity of birds, or the
genetic basis of taste in any bird species. Because birds
are adapted to a diverse range of habitats and dietary
niches, they are an ideal study system for questionsJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 37
about the evolutionary ecology of taste. The candi-
date will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of avian
taste receptor genes, dierences in feeding behaviour
and taste preferences across individuals and species, and
the physiological processes underlying taste behaviour
plasticity.

The genomic architecture of mitochondria
Supervisors
Dr Nick Lane, Dr Francisco Ubeda, Prof. Andrew Po-
miankowski and Prof. Vincent A.A. Jansen
Research Outline
Mitochondria transitioned from free-living bacteria to
obligate symbionts of eukaryotic cells. In this process
they gave up a good part of their genome (either lost or
transferred to the nucleus of their host cell) and their
reproductive independence (which is now controlled by
the nucleus).
Little is known regarding this fundamental transition.
We are interested in which scenarios favor the transfer
of genes from bacteria engulfed by a cell to the nucleus,
and the transfer of reproductive control to the host
nucleus.
In the rst place we will do this through studying mod-
els of the evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial genes.
By taking a gene eye-view we will be able to determine
when the gene copies in the nuclear genome would out-
compete the ones in the mitochondrial genome. We plan
to test model predictions using model organism such as
Chlamydomonas and Yeast.
This studentship is suitable for candidates with a back-
ground in biology or the quantitative or life sciences,
and some experience, interest and exposure to the use
of mathematical models. It is particularly suited for
candidates who have already obtained a good MSc. This

UCollege London TetrapodEvolution
We are currently accepting applications for a fully-
funded 4-year PhD studentship on morphological evolu-
tion and modularity in tetrapods in the Goswami lab
at University College London
Further details about the lab at www.goswamilab.com
Project Description:
Morphological variation is the foundation of evolution-
ary theory, but the basic inuences on morphological
variation are still poorly understood. Developmental
interactions are often discussed as a major control on
variation, but direct analysis of this hypothesis has been
hindered by the lack of quantitative comparative data.
Similarly, robust analyses analysing both extrinsic and
intrinsic inuences on morphological evolution are often
limited by data availability.
Using advanced biological imaging techniques (CT- and
laser scanning) combined with surface-based 3-D mor-
phometrics, this study will build on existing work in
mammals by providing the rst broad comparative data
on modularity and disparity of skulls, jaws and limbs
for living and fossil tetrapods. The PhD studentship
will focus on one of the major non-mammalian clades,
such as lissamphibians or reptiles, clades with incred-
ible diversity in reproductive strategies, ecology and
morphology. This project will require extensive inter-
national travel for data collection, as well as running
analyses and possibly writing new code in R. In combi-
nation with existing data from an ontogenetic sequence
of Xenopus, and juvenile and adult neontological and
paleontological specimens of mammals, this project will
produce a robust analysis of the relationships among
modularity, morphological disparity, evolutionary rates
and how each of these responds to major life history
and ecological transitions as well as large-scale biotic
and environmental events.38 EvolDir January 1, 2015
In addition to training in biological imaging and quan-
titative analyses, there will be opportunities for inter-
national palaeontological eldwork during the course of
this project. This project is part of a larger European
Research Council grant that will fund a total of 5 team
members, including this studentship.

UEssex ArticialSelection
Microorganisms are central to many biotechnologies, in-
cluding the synthesis of many chemicals, the production
of biofuels from algae and the bioremediation of water
contaminated by oil. The use of complex communities
represents the next frontier in microbial biotechnology.
Ecological and evolutionary theory can inform eorts
conducted to assemble such useful communities or isolate
them from wild environments. The process of producing
and maintaining these communities also provides the
ideal test bed for these same ecological and evolutionary
theories.
The PhD Student will use articial selection to increase
a trait value of interest in complex communities of mi-
croorganisms. Articial selection allows us to force a
link between the tness of communities and a desired
trait value. This link can counteract natural selection
and ensures the proliferation of the desired community
type. The trait can be a biochemical character such
as chlorophyll concentration or a service such as the
rate of degradation of a pollutant. The student will
use high-throughput methods including microtiter plate
assaying and cell-sorting ow-cytometry to characterize
the communities and apply selection. This will be used
to test the factors that aect the rate and nal amount
of change in a trait value under selection.

Project: The challenges posed by big data are the new
reality across scientic disciplines. For example, re-
cent advances in high throughput DNA sequencing tech-
nology for genomics have revolutionised our ability to
quantifying how genes are expressed at cellular, biolog-
ical, and evolutionary scales. However, the tools for
analysing the resultant big data from such transcrip-
tomics studies have not kept pace for biological and
evolutionary perspectives on gene expression and co-
expressed gene networks. The current project aims to
advance the eld by applying ideas from topology V a
branch of mathematics that is specically adapted to
treat qualitative properties such as connectivity. Since
the expression of genes in an organism are co-dependent,
co-varying and continuous, treating data from a topo-
logical viewpoint can reveal new relationships by Vperhaps paradoxically V deliberately ignoring structure
from conventional modes of traditional analysis. This
project will bridge mathematics and biology to adapt
and develop new ways to analyse patterns in complex
data, specically transcriptome-wide gene expression in
evolutionary, molecular, and biodiversity context.

Supervisors
Prof. Vincent A.A. Jansen (Royal Holloway), Dr John
Pinney (Imperial College), and Prof. Michael Stumpf
(Imperial College)
Research Outline
This studentship aims to understand how populations
of bacteria interact within a population of hosts that
carry these bacteria. We want to know how popula-
tions of gut bacteria interact, and what forces structure
such bacterial populations. This will be investigated
through modelling these populations and investigating
the population dynamics and evolution in these models.
This work is important because foodborne zoonotic
bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, are
important cause of foodborne illness. One way to reduce
the incidence of foodborne is to reduce the abundance
of the pathogenic strains in the populations of their
animal hosts such as cattle and poultry. To do this suc-
cessfully, we need to know what shapes the community
of bacterial strains in the host population.
Many dierent strains of bacteria are found in host pop-
ulations, and we do not really know what makes some
of these strains abundant and others much less so. ToJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 41
reduce the numbers of pathogenic bacteria in animal
hosts, nding out how such populations are structured
and organised is very important. This will be done
through making mathematical or computer models of
the bacterial populations in their hosts.
The studentship will be held at the School of Biological
Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London, UK,
and supervised by a team of supervisors from Royal
Holloway and Imperial College London. We are looking
for either a biology graduate with strong interest in
evolutionary theory and modelling, or an economics /
mathematics /computer science graduate with strong
interest in biology and evolution. This studentship is
part of the BBSRC Doctoral training partnership jointly
awarded to Imperial College and Royal Holloway. Stu-
dentships are fully funded and normally for a duration
of four years (unless a relevant MSc has already been
obtained). The applicant will need to fulll the UK
research council's residency criteria.
If you are interested in doing a PhD in mathematical

Research Outline
Natural selection explains the adaptation of individuals
but genes within individuals may act as Trojan horsessabotaging adaptive processes as long as they gain an
evolutionary advantage. Evolutionary theory provides a
unique insight into the role of genes within maladaptive
processes.
We invite applications for a PhD studentship in the
evolutionary theory group at the School of Biological
Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London, UK. We
are looking for either a biology graduate with strong
interest in evolutionary theory and modelling, or an
economics / mathematics /computer science graduate
with strong interest in biology and evolution.
Current research in our labs involves the use of mathe-
matical models - population genetics, game theory, kin
selection, theoretical epidemiology and ecology- to un-
derstand evolutionary processes within the individual
and between individuals in a wide range of organisms
from viruses to humans. Our groups are well connected
with theoretical and empirical biologists within the Lon-
don area and beyond.
This project is suitable for candidates with some back-
ground or experience in mathematical modeling or sim-
ulation at undergraduate level. We are looking for
candidates, either with a background in the life sciences,
and experience in mathematical or simulation modeling,
or for candidates with a background in a quantitative
subject (e.g. mathematics, computer science, physics)
and an anity for research in ecology and evolution.
If you are an EU national interested in the genes eye
view of evolution in general, and human evolution in
particular, and you are careful thinker consider applying
to the funded PhD opportunity we oer.

UMontana Astrobiology2
New graduate student positions at the NASA Astrobiol-
ogy Institute at the University of Montana (admitting
for Fall 2015)
Overview:
The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) at the Univer-
sity of Montana is seeking outstanding graduate students
interested in pursuing research related to the evolution
of biological complexity. Research assistantships (NIH
scale) are available to work on projects led by Scott
Miller, Matt Herron and Margie Kinnersley. NAI stu-
dents will join the robust and collaborative Evolutionary
Genetics and Genomics Group, a diverse set of UM fac-
ulty using genetic and genomic approaches to investigate
evolutionary processes in plants, animals, and microbes.
Funding is also available for short- or long-term travel
to the UM-NAI partner labs of Vaughan Cooper (U
New Hampshire), Shelley Copley (U Colorado, Boul-
der), Gavin Sherlock (Stanford U), and Paul Sniegowski
(U Pennsylvania). Students will also have the opportu-
nity to interact with Montana NAI team leader Frank
Rosenzweig, Montana NAI co-Investigator John Mc-
Cutcheon, as well as with theoretical biologists Eric
Smith (Santa Fe Institute) and Phil Gerrish (U New
Mexico), who will be summer scholars-in-residence at
Montana and Pennsylvania, respectively.
Program Description:
It is now widely recognized that not just competitive,
but also cooperative interactions are fundamental fea-
tures of biological systems ranging from enzymes to
organelles, cells and societies of cells and organisms.
The Montana NAI consists of eight projects organized
around ve questions related to how such interactions
inuenced major transitions in the history of Life: (1)
How do enzymes and metabolic networks evolve? (2)
How did the eukaryotic cell come to be, specically the
cell that contained a mitochondrion? (3) How do sym-
bioses arise? (4) How does multicellularity evolve? and
(5) How do pleiotropy, epistasis and mutation rate con-
strain the evolution of novel traits? A unifying theme
underlying these questions is: how do cooperative vs.
competitive interactions play out in driving major transi-
tions that occur when independently replicating entities
combine into a larger, more complex whole?
Project Descriptions:Consequences of recA duplication for recombina-
tion, genome stability and tness (PI Scott Miller;
Scott.Miller@mso.umt.edu; www.cas.umt.edu/dbs/-
labs/miller/ ):
Despite the importance of homologous recombination
during the proliferation of biological diversity, we still
have a poor understanding of the balance of its creative,
stabilizing and destabilizing contributions to organis-
mal tness and genome evolution. Addressing this issue
hinges on understanding the regulation of the expression
and activity of the recombinase A (recA) gene family,
an ancient gene family that plays a central role in HR-
mediated processes in all three domains of life. We
will use the extraordinary genetic variation exhibited
by duplicated recA gene copies in the genomes of the
cyanobacterium Acaryochloris as a model to address
both the impact of recA copy number on recombination
and tness and whether Acaryochloris RecA paralogs
have specialized for dierent sub-functions. With the
recent development of genetic tools for these organisms
that enables us to manipulate recA copy number, the
Acaryochloris system presents a unique opportunity to
gain novel insights on the tness consequences that
emerge from the interplay between HR-mediated main-
tenance of genome stability, selectively favored gene
duplications and non-adaptive genomic rearrangements.
The evolution of complexity via multicel-
lularity and cell dierentiation (PI Matt
Herron; matthew.herron@mso.umt.edu;
rosenzweig.dbs.umt.edu/people/matthew-herron/):
How and why organismal complexity increases are cen-
tral questions in evolutionary biology. Although the vast
majority of life forms remain simple, both the maximum
and the average levels of complexity have increased from
the origin of life to the present day. Large increases in
organismal complexity resulted from a series of events
in which existing individuals combined to become parts
of a new kind of individual with components specialized
for various roles. Such events are known as major tran-
sitions and include the emergence of cellular life from
groups of interacting molecular replicators, of eukary-
otes from two prokaryotes, of multicellular organisms
from unicells, and of eusocial `superorganisms' from in-
dividual animals. Among such transitions, the evolution
of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors
set the stage for unprecedented increases in complex-
ity, especially in land plants and animals. We have
used the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii to experimentally generate de novo origins of
simple (undierentiated) multicellularity in two separate
experiments. Using these newly-evolved, multicellular
Chlamydomonas, we plan to ascertain the genetic basesJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 43

UMontana PlantEvolution
GeneticsGenomics
The Fishman Lab at the University of Montana is recruit-
ing PhD (or MS, possibly) students to pursue studies of
adaptation and speciation using the genus *Mimulus*
(monkeyowers) as a model system.
I am particularly interested in recruiting an outstand-
ing student to develop integrative research on yellow
monkeyower adaptation to geothermal habitats in Yel-
lowstone National Park. A newly funded project (2015-
2018) will investigate diverse traits that allow plants
to live in this extreme environment and contribute to
their reproductive isolation from nearby nonthermal
populations. This novel system provides many research
opportunities for a student prepared to integrate physio-
logical, genetic, and genomic approaches to understand-
ing adaptation and speciation (as well as the necessity of
eldwork in one of the most amazing places on Earth!).
Other active research areas in the lab include the genetic
basis of parallel divergence in life history, mating sys-
tem and owering time, the evolution of postmating and
postzygotic species barriers, the role of chromosomal
rearrangements in speciation, and selsh centromere evo-
lution. In addition, students are encouraged to develop
new research areas within the broad framework of plant
evolution. *Mimulus* is a model system for evolutionary
genomics, with tremendous biological diversity, excellent
genome resources, and a collaborative research commu-
nity. For more information on our current research, see
the lab web page at: http://www.cas.umt.edu/dbs/-

interactive and productive group of six labs (J. Good, J.
McCutcheon, S. Miller, F. Rosenzweig, and D. Emlen
labs) at UMontana with diverse organismal foci but
shared enthusiasm for evolutionary questions addressed
with genomic tools. The Organismal Biology and Ecol-
ogy Program at UM has faculty research strengths in
evolutionary genomics, physiology, and ecology, excel-
lent training for students, and outstanding access to
natural areas for both research and recreation. We

\From pests to paradise: control and conservation of
molluscan biodiversity".
BBSRC DTP-funded PhD position
Dr. Angus Davison, University of Nottingham
Snails and slugs are a major crop pest, with a few intro-
duced species causing worldwide problems. Yet, they
are dicult to identify and we have little idea of how
this biodiversity has come about, hindering appropri-
ate control and conservation eorts. This project will
use next generation sequencing methods to investigate
the evolution and speciation of snails, especially with
respect to characters under natural selection (e.g. shell
colour and banding), and including methods that may
help identify invasive or cryptic species, or species of
conservation concern.
Building upon the work of a recent BBSRC-funded PhD
student (Richards et al 2013), who investigated the
diversity within colour polymorphic Cepaea, this new
project will investigate the degree of parallelism and con-
vergence between Cepaea and other species. Ultimately,
the precise project will be determined by the interests
of the student, but the overall aim is that he/she will
begin to determine if the same modes of speciation and
evolution are involved in widely divergent species. The
conclusions will have implications for both control and
conservation of molluscan biodiversity.
Although much of the work will be lab-based, with a
related bioinformatics element, eld collection will be a
necessary component, including probable work in East
Asia or the Caribbean region.
The closing date for applications for this fully funded
scheme is Sunday 21 December 2014. It is advisable
to make an informal enquiry with Dr Angus Davison
(angus.davison@nottingham.ac.uk) prior to making a
formal application.
Successful candidates will be oered four years PhD
training. Part of the rst year will consist of lab ro-
tations, with the remaining time focused on the main
research project. Funding requirements mean that the
project is advertised under the \Agricultural and Food
Security" banner. Funding available to UK residents
(fees + stipend) and EU citizens (fees only).

UOtago NewZealand NicheVariation
Travis Ingram's research group at the University of
Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, is seeking a PhD
student with interests in niche theory, evolution and
freshwater ecology.
The three-year PhD studentship will be funded by a
grant from the Royal Society of New Zealand's Marsden
Fund between 2015-2017. The project will address the
causes and consequences of individual niche specialisa-
tion in multiple ecological dimensions. Our study system
will be a metacommunity of wetland ponds containing
native (common bully, Gobiomorphus cotidianus) and
introduced (perch, Perca uviatilis) sh species. We
will measure the extent of individual specialization in
diet and habitat use in these populations, and use ex-
periments in ponds and mesocosms to investigate the
ecological causes and consequences of multidimensional
niche variation.
The successful student will be expected to lead multiple
eld seasons, to help to shape the project to reect their
interests and expertise, and to take the lead on pub-
lishing and presenting the results. Quantitative skills
(including matrix algebra and multilevel statistical mod-
eling) or experience with freshwater sh biology and
food web ecology would be assets. PhD programs are
short in New Zealand (3-4 years), so it is important
that the student is capable of planning and beginning
research soon after arrival, and evidence of previous
research experience is essential (e.g. a Masters or a BSc
Honours thesis). The start date is negotiable but prefer-
ably during the austral winter (between June-August
2015).
The scholarship is fully funded by the Marsden grant for
three years, and includes a NZ$25,000 annual stipend,
associated student fees, and funds for conference travel,with opportunities to apply for additional research and
travel funding. Dunedin is a coastal city of 120,000
in the south part of New Zealand's beautiful South
Island. The University of Otago is an internationally
successful research university, and the Department of
Zoology is a busy and productive department with par-
ticular strengths in freshwater ecology and evolutionary
genetics and numerous opportunities for collaboration.
If interested, please email the following to Dr. Travis
Ingram at <travis.ingram@otago.ac.nz >- a cover letter
summarizing your research experience and interests -
a current curriculum vitae - a copy of your university
transcripts (unocial transcripts are ok) - names and
email addresses of two individuals willing to write letters
of recommendation on your behalf (please do not have
referees send letters at this point)
Informal enquiries prior to application are welcome, as
are enquiries from students interested in other projects
that fall broadly within our research interests. These in-
clude but are not limited to macroevolutionary studies of
trait diversication and eco-evolutionary studies of food
web interactions: for descriptions of our research and
publications see our website at http://www.otago.ac.nz/-

Our research project within the University Focus Area
Functional Ecology and Evolution aims to uncover the
genomic and ecological basis of local adaptations in ver-
tebrates, invertebrates and plants in response to dierent
climatic conditions. The results of our investigations
should lead to more informed and realistic predictions
about the eects of human-mediated climate change on
future biodiversity patterns.
The comprehensive experimental design uses both tem-
poral and spatial climatic transects to study represen-
tative species ranging from invertebrates to vertebrates
and plant species. We combine ecological phenotyp-
ing and genome sequencing of target organisms across
space and time with paleogenomic analyses of selected
species across the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. We
strive to support conclusions based on genomic data
and modeling with a range of ecological common gar-
den, competition and climate change experiments to
identify the genomic basis of adaptation to rapid cli-
matic change
* Evolutionary adaptive responses to rapid climate
change in plants We are looking for a highly motivated

gradient from mid-to Northern Europe, (ii) common gar-
den and greenhouse experiments as well as crossing ex-
periments using a population genetic approach, and (iii)
molecular and statistical analyses of genomic and phe-
notypic response data. Applicants should have a deep
interest in plant evolutionary ecology and hold a Master
degree (or equivalent) in the relevant research elds (e.g.
plant population genetics). Applicants are expected to
have relevant laboratory experience, and an interest in
the design and analysis of ecological experiments. This
position requires strong communication skills and a very

with their curiosity and their dedication makes Uppsala
University one of Sweden's most exciting work places.
Uppsala University has 41.000 students, 6,500 employees
and a turnover of SEK 5,900 million.
Project description: The PhD position is part of an
externally founded project to investigate the environ-
mental factors that control the production of edible
mushrooms in western Africa. Mushrooms are an im-
portant part of the diet for many people in West Africa
and selling mushrooms give an opportunity of monetary
income. Many edible mushrooms are ectomycorrhizal,
i.e. form a symbiotic relation with trees, and there
are calculations indicating that the potential value of
mushroom production is higher than the value of timber
production in many forests.
The project will include inventories of mushrooms and
collection of climate data for sample sites in ectomyc-
orrhizal forests in Benin. Species determination using
morphology and molecular methods will be an impor-
tant part of the project. Except the goal to predict
mushroom production from climate data, there will be
studies of fungal diversity and etnomycology. The exact
questions of the PhD-work will be developed in collab-
oration with other project participants and there are
also opportunities to pursue studies outside the main
project. The project will be done in close collabora-
tion with scientists and students at the University of

UStAndrews ComputationalBiology
PhD Studentship, Robustness and Fragility of Microbial
Metabolic Networks
A PhD studentship in computational systems biology is
available at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.
Understanding the robustness and fragility of microbial
metabolic networks will have impacts across bioscience,
in particular for understanding how pathogens might
respond to anti-infective drugs which target the enzymes50 EvolDir January 1, 2015
essential to the pathogen's metabolism, and how mi-
crobes might respond to synthetic biology modications
which co-opt or otherwise interact with the organism's
metabolism.
This studentship will apply computational systems biol-
ogy, bioinformatics, and network analysis to assess the
robustness and fragility of microbial metabolic networks.
You will use data on the interaction between proteins
and small organic molecules to decipher metabolic net-
works, where enzyme-catalysed reactions link together
substrates and products to form pathways and cycles.
You will work with bioinformatics data to trace to both
the variation of networks across dierent species and
also the networks evolution; you will apply simulations
of metabolisms evolution to work backwards in time
and suggest plausible evolutionary trajectories.
Ultimately, you will develop predictions of perturbations
that disrupt metabolic networks, and those which would
have little eect. You will categorise the architecture and
robustness or fragility of metabolic systems across both
biological species and time. Likely future applications
include the use of synthetic biology to exquisitely design
interventions that will aect a pathogen's metabolism
without risk to the host or environment.
You will obtain training in bioinformatics, systems bi-
ology, modelling, and machine learning, as well as a
working knowledge of microbial metabolic networks.
You will be jointly supervised by Dr V Anne Smith
(Biology) and Dr John Mitchell (Chemistry). Both
groups work in computational systems biology and ma-
chine learning, with Dr Smiths research concentrating
on network analysis and Dr Mitchells on enzymes and
computational chemistry. For more information on

local ecotypic specialization as well as adaptational lag.
This project will: 1) investigate the genetic factors that
lead to local adaptation using genetic markers and 2) ex-
amine natural disturbance as a mechanism for genotypes
from warmer climates to establish in tussock tundra of
northern regions by seeding a recent burn site and iden-
tifying genotype success utilizing molecular markers.
This research aims to provide students with a multi-
disciplinary training as part of a collaborative team that
also includes Drs. Ned Fetcher (Wilkes University) and
Jim Tang (Marine Biological Laboratory; MBL).
Qualications: Candidates with background in Molecu-
lar Ecology and Evolutionary Theory are strongly en-

Potential advisors
Marion Brodhagen: Microbiology, molecular biology,
and chemical ecology. Our lab studies the plant
pathogenic fungus Aspergillus and aatoxin, a potent
toxin produced by this fungus. Our current projects
involve the ability of certain plant secondary metabo-
lites to stop growth and/or toxin production by As-
pergillus. Future research directions will include inves-
tigations of the molecular mechanisms by which these
plant compounds alter fungal metabolism. We also are
interested in the role of Aspergillus in colonization of
plastics labeled biodegradable, in agricultural settings.
Aspergillus is a key colonizer of such plastics but its
ability to break down polymers is unclear, as is the
extent of toxin formation during plastic colonization.
Dave Hooper: Plant Community and Ecosystem Ecol-52 EvolDir January 1, 2015
ogy. I will be accepting one graduate student in fall
2015. My local research is currently focused on assessing
ecosystem services associated with dierent scenarios of
riparian restoration in Whatcom County. Student work
would combine GIS analyses of ecosystem services and
eld work, particularly on nutrient retention, to vali-
date modeling results. I also have opportunities focused
on analyzing large data sets to understand aspects of
biodiversity loss and assembly of plant communities.
Robin Kodner: Marine Microbial Metagenomics. The
Kodner lab does interdisciplinary work integrating ma-
rine microbial ecology with comparative genomics and
bioinformatics for metagenomes. I am recruiting for
one student for work on bioinformatics projects. Some
experience with sequence analysis and programming
required.
Ben Miner: Students in my laboratory focus on how
marine organisms alter their morphology and behav-
ior in response to dierent environmental conditions,
typically biotic conditions. Current projects in my lab
include research on wasting disease in sea stars, predator-
induced hatching plasticity in marine animals, context-
dependent inducible oenses and defenses in marine
organisms.
Craig Moyer: My interests are marine microbiology and
geomicrobiology focusing on molecular approaches for
exploring microbial diversity, community structure and
ecological interactions. Presently, my lab and I are
focused on the study of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobac-
teria acting as the ecosystem engineers in microbial
mats found at strong redox boundaries, including seep,
spring and vent habitats. We are also examining the
evolutionary divergence of surface and deep subsurface
Zetaproteobacteria in hydrothermal systems.Merrill Peterson: Ecology and Evolution of Insects. The
primary focus of our lab is on insect diversication and
diversity. Potential graduate student projects include:
1) experimental investigation of the mechanistic basis
of sperm precedence in hybridizing Chrysochus beetles,
2) analyses of the factors inuencing insect species rich-
ness in rapidly-declining natural habitats in the region
(e.g., lowland prairies, coastal dunes), and 3) using a
database of the regions moth collections to document
community-wide responses to climate change.
Lynn Pillitteri: Plant Molecular and Developmental
Biology. A potential graduate project in my lab would
be aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms
driving cell type dierentiation in the model organism,
Arabidopsis thaliana.
Dietmar Schwarz: Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics
and Genomics, Evolutionary Ecology. Schwarz's lab
oers opportunities to study speciation, hybridization,
and adaptation in host specic insects (apple maggot

MaxPlanck CollectiveBehavior
*Job oers from Feb 2015*
The Department of Collective Behavior at the Max
Planck Institute for Ornithology seeks to appoint up to
four Max Planck Principal Investigators in the eld of
Collective Behavior, broadly dened. Ideal candidates
should have a research program that integrates experi-
mental and theoretical studies on invertebrates and/or
vertebrates - research on birds is not a requirement. Col-
lective behavior naturally spans scales, encompassing
areas ranging from the organization and evolution of the
neural decision-making circuits that give rise to individ-
ual behavior, to coordinated communication among cells,
or animals, to the dynamics of information exchange
among sophisticated organisms and the emergence of
complex societies. Successful applicants are expected to
establish and lead an internationally recognized research
program.* Your prole* Applicants must hold a Ph.D.
in biology, biophysics, applied mathematics, computer
science or a related eld. The primary criterion for
selection will be that candidates exhibit outstanding
research promise, and are conducting ambitious, inter-
disciplinary research. Candidates who pursue research
with a highly quantitative experimental component are
particularly encouraged to apply.
*Our oer*
Successful candidates will be oered a Max Planck Re-
search Lab for an initial period of 5 years, with the
possibility of extension up to a further 4 years after suc-
cessful evaluation and considering labor law-related and
nancial requirements. This includes a Principal Inves-
tigator position with a salary up to level E15 based on
the German Federal Salary Scale as well as support for
a research group (consumables, travel funds, technical
support sta, and where possible support for excellent
Ph.D. students/postdoctoral fellows). Principal Investi-
gators are also expected to apply for third party funds.
Max Planck Institutes focus on excellence in scientic
research and are supported by the Max Planck Society.
Principal Investigators are expected to become faculty
of the International Max Planck Research School ofOrganismal Biology, a competitive doctoral training
program in the elds of behavior, ecology, evolution,
physiology and neurobiology, which has a faculty of
more than 30 leading researchers and 64 Ph.D. inter-
national student fellows. Although the principal focus
will be leading a research group, candidates are also
expected to contribute to the innovative teaching ob-
jectives of the department. The language of the Max
Planck Institutes is English and consequently applicants
must be uent in this language; knowledge of German
is not necessary. We seek candidates from all nation-
alities (the visa application process will be supported
by the Institute). Principal Investigators will benet
from the Institute's interdisciplinary environment and
scientic exchange with existing research groups at the
Max Planck Institute and University of Konstanz as
well as excellent infrastructure, including a guesthouse
for visiting academics, and speedboat and plane for eld
research. The necessary administrative support will be
provided.
*Location***
The new Department of Collective Behavior is located
on the campus of the University of Konstanz in the
historic city of Konstanz, by Lake Constance and over-
looking the Alps in southern Germany. It is approxi-
mately 50 minutes (by train or car) from Zurich Interna-
tional Airport and closely aliated with the nearby Max
Planck Department of Migration and Immuno-Ecology
in Radolfzell.
*Your application*
Applications, including a CV, a description of past re-
search activities (2 pages) and a vision statement for the
future research program (2 further pages) should be sent,
in PDF format, to Iain D. Couzin (icouzin@orn.mpg.de),
Director,with subject line \Max Planck Principal In-
vestigator Application". In addition, applicants should
arrange to have three letters of recommendation sent sep-
arately to Daniel Piechowski (dpiechowski@orn.mpg.de),
Science Coordinator. Review of applications will begin
immediately and continue until the positions are lled.
The Max Planck Society is committed to increasing
the number of individuals with disabilities in its work-
force and therefore encourages applications from such
qualied individuals. Furthermore, the Max Planck So-
ciety seeks to increase the number of women in those
areas where they are underrepresented and therefore
explicitly encourages women to apply. All Max Planck
Institutes are certied family-friendly institutions, and
we oer extensive support to help researchers balance
professional and home life, including assistance with
childcare and support of the elderly, and exibility in
how employees arrange working hours. For details see60 EvolDir January 1, 2015

AvianPaternity data
Dear EvolDir users,
(sorry for repost, some users pointed out no contact
information)
I'm currently assembling a database for a meta-analysis
looking at the performance of extra-pair young in versus
within-pair young in birds. I would appreciate your help
in getting the data that was not published (e.g. due
to lack of signicant results, low statistical power etc).
The types of data I would require include mainly dier-
ences between the extra-pair and within-pair young in
any phenotypic traits (morphology, physiology, genetics,
sex-ratio, life-history etc). The form of these dierences
should ideally be means in respective groups (within-
pair and extra-pair young) and respective sample sizes
but if for some reasons original means are not available
any form of sigicance testing is acceptable. Of course
- I would gladly accept original data if only you could
share them with me - that would make calculation of
relevant eect sizes the easiest.
The data of particular interest are dierences measured
in several consecutive breeding seasons (accompanied
by indication of geographical location and year ID) or
measures taken in diering conditions (e.g. dierent
experimental treatments, dierent climatic regimes etc.)
Please contact me if you nd my explanations unclear,
I'll be happy to explain everything in more detail if
needed.

GBIF EbbeNielsenChallenge
The GBIF Secretariat has launched the inaugural GBIF
Ebbe Nielsen Challenge, hoping to inspire innovative
applications of open-access biodiversity data by scien-
tists, informaticians, data modelers, cartographers and
other experts.
Background
For the past 12 years, GBIF has awarded the Ebbe
Nielsen Prize to recognize outstanding contributions to
biodiversity informatics while honouring the legacy of
Ebbe Nielsen, one of the principal founders of GBIF,
who tragically died just before it came into being.
The Science Committee, working with the Secretariat,
has revamped the award for 2015 as the GBIF Ebbe
Nielsen Challenge. This open incentive competition
seeks to encourage innovative uses of the more than half
a billion species occurrence records mobilized through
GBIF's international network. These creative applica-
tions of GBIF-mediated data may come in any form
and variety\from new analytical research and richer
policy-relevant visualizations to improvements to pro-
cesses around data digitization, quality and access"or
something else entirely.
For more background on the challenge please visit http:/-
/www.gbif.org/page/62262 Challenge
A jury composed of experts from the biodiversity in-formatics community will judge the Round One entries
collected through this ChallengePost website on their
innovation, functionality and applicability, before select-
ing three to six nalists to compete for a >20,000 First
Prize later in 2015.

Madrid StarlingPopBiol Volunteers
Volunteers seeked: Starling Camp 2015
Between April and June 2015 we will run our yearly in-
tensive research campaign in our starling colony, 50 kms
from Madrid. Around 250 nest boxes are almost daily
followed through the two sequential broods that most
nests obtain. Field work includes capturing adult birds
for measuring and sampling, follow-up of reproduction
(egg laying, hatching and edging), ringing nestlings,
setting-up of microchip readers to assess parental care...,
as well as other activities related to the specic experi-
ments running in each year.
The eld site is a pleasant and undisturbed woodland,
an hour from Madrid. Several researchers, PhDs and
master students take part in the eld work, but to be
able to run it properly, we count with the help of a few
volunteers every year. We provide free accommodation
for volunteers in a nearby eld station, transport to
and from the eld site, and a fantastic team-work at-
mosphere. We are happy to consider volunteers for any
periods of time starting from a minimum of 2 months.

pirical view of the population pedigree
Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 10:00 AM PST
Often, the summary statistics of population genetics are
framed in the setting of Kingman's coalescent or related
models. These statistics can be alternatively thought
of as descriptive statistics of the realized population
pedigree-with-recombination, in a way that has become
much more useful in the era of whole-genome sequencing.
For instance, pairwise number of nucleotide dierencesJanuary 1, 2015 EvolDir 79
is proportional to \eective population size", which is
sometimes more usefully thought of as an estimate of
the average length of the path through the pedigree to
the most recent common ancestor at a randomly chosen
locus (with an explicit standard error). Another exam-
ple is the pairwise distribution of long tracts of IBD,
which provides an estimate of a functional of the entire
distribution of such paths.

Software TeachingEvolution
Some very talented developers have created mobile apps
to help with teaching transmission genetics and evolu-
tionary genetics for our Duke and Coursera classes, but
these apps are likely broadly useful for other classes.
The basic versions are free, and run on both iOS
(iPhone/iPad/ iPod Touch) and Android devices. Ad-
ditionally, for those without smartphones, the new An-
droid app can also be run on PCs.
One of the most useful features is a \problem generator"
that will make an innite number of problems for either
the professor to use on tests or for students to prac-
tice (including Hardy-Weinberg, 3-point cross mapping,
heritability, and population growth). Additionally, the
evolutionary simulator (\AlleleFreak") is very elegant
at demonstrating single locus allele frequency changes
under any combination of selection, genetic drift, and
inbreeding.

pact of gene losses on the evolutionary diversication of
mechanisms of development in chordates, focusing on
Wnt, Fgf signaling, and heart development. Our main
subject of study is Oikopleura dioica, a new emergent
urochordate model within our own phylum, with the
smallest metazoan genome size known so far, and with
an outstanding amount of gene losses (Denoeud et al.,

DiseaseResistanceGenes
What: postdoc to test candidate genes for disease resis-
tance in Biomphalaria snails
Where: Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR
PI: Michael Blouin
Description: A position as a postdoctoral scholar is
available to start immediately in Michael Blouin's lab at
Oregon State University, Department of Integrative Biol-
ogy. Candidate must be within 5 years of PhD to qualify
for the postdoctoral scholar position at OSU. The aim
of this project is to identify genes in the snail Biom-
phalaria glabrata, that convey resistance to Schistosoma
mansoni, a major parasite of humans that is transmitted
by this snail host. We have already found major QTL
correlated with infection risk in laboratory populations
of snails and have annotated nearby candidate genes.
Thus, the major task for this position is to functionally
assess candidate genes for their role in resistance. The
main approach to this goal will be gene knockdowns
using RNAi, but may also include transgenics, neutral-
izing antibodies, immunohistochemistry, or proteomics.
Once causal gene(s) are identied, future work may in-
clude probing their mechanisms of action, including how
they interact with parasite-derived molecules. The long-January 1, 2015 EvolDir 93
term purpose of this research is to nd ways to block
transmission of schistosomiasis via interference with the
snail host. The candidate will be encouraged to develop
his/her own ideas to approach this goal. Biomphalaria
and Schistosoma form a well-studied model host-parasite
system with numerous available molecular and genomic
resources and established laboratory protocols. The suc-
cessful candidate will hold a PhD in biology or a related
science and be able to document substantial expertise
in molecular/cellular biology. Strongly desired qualica-
tions include experience with RNAi and/or alternative
gene knockdown/knockout techniques, especially in an
invertebrate system. Other desirable qualications in-
clude experience in microscopy and immunohistochem-
istry techniques, a background in protein biochemistry,
and training in immunology. Strong computational and
quantitative skills would be useful too. We are looking
for a highly motivated and enthusiastic candidate with
excellent writing and communication skills.
Position will be open until a suitable candidate is found.
Ability to start soon would be highly desirable. This
project is funded by NIH grant AI109134 to Michael S.
Blouin.
To Apply: For more information or to apply, contact
Mike at blouinm@science.oregonstate.edu and include
\Snail postdoc position" in the title of your email. To
apply, include a curricula vitae that includes the names
of at least three professional references, their email ad-
dresses and telephone contact numbers. Include a cover
letter indicating how your qualications and experience
have prepared you for this position, and what interests
you about coming to Oregon State University to work
on this project.

Paris EvolutionaryEcology
Post-doc position in Evolutionary Ecology/Community
Ecology/Theoretical Ecology
\Adaptation and Resilience of Spatial Ecological Net-
works to human-induced changes"
Anthropogenic environmental changes increasingly
threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services, thus kin-
dling a societal demand for predictions that ecology
as a science has yet to answer. Available models are
poorly suited to predicting the ecological eects of such
changes because they ignore variation in species' nichedue to ecological interactions and evolution. Without
understanding the functioning of ecological networks
and how they are shaped by evolution, it is indeed dif-
cult to predict how changes of the environment will
cascade through ecosystems and make species traits
evolve. Understanding the dynamics of ecological net-
works is a dual goal, both for fundamental research and
for building informed programs on sustainable ecosys-
tem services and species conservation. Accounting for
species interactions and evolution to understand the
consequences of global changes is the critical question
we want to tackle through the post doc we propose here.
In this context, the post-doctoral fellow will develop
models linking the coevolution of traits to the structure
of ecological networks (both trophic and mutualistic net-
works). Such models will especially account for spatial
aspects, i.e. heterogeneous landscapes and dispersal of
individuals among habitat patches, and will focus on
the structure of ecological communities emerging from
evolutionary processes acting at the landscape scale.
Modelling will be based on adaptive dynamics and/or
theoretical quantitative genetics methods.
Application Process
This job is supported by a larger ANR project ARSENIC
(2015-2019) involving a network of 8 dierent labs, most
of them in France. More precisely, this position will
involve collaborations between the Ecology, Evolution &
Paleontology lab in Lille and of the Institute of Ecology
and Environmental Sciences in Paris.
The post-doctoral fellow will work at IEES Paris (Insti-
tute of Ecology and Environmental Sciences of Paris).
IEES is a new laboratory that merges dierent aspects
of ecology, such as evolutionary ecology, community
ecology and functional ecology. The post-doc fellow
would be part of the team \Ecology and Evolution of
Interaction Networks" (team leader: Nicolas Loeuille).
The post-doctoral position will particularly focus on the
theoretical developments proposed above. We welcome
applications from candidates with a PhD in ecology,
evolutionary biology or applied mathematics, with good
skills in ecological modelling, theoretical ecology and
evolutionary ecology. Skills in game theory, adaptive
dynamics or quantitative genetics modelling will be par-
ticularly appreciated.
The position is funded for two years. Salary depends on
experience (eg, about 2200 euro two years after PhD).
Applications will be considered until the position is
lled.
To apply, send a CV and a letter express-
ing why the project interests you to Nicolas
Loeuille (nicolas.loeuille@upmc.fr) and Fran cois Mas-94 EvolDir January 1, 2015

GENETICS
Searching for an enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher
to work on single cell genomics of the malaria para-
sites, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
Plasmodium parasites are of huge medical importance,
causing ~700,000 deaths per year and millions of in-
fections. However, we know little about how genetic
diversity of parasites within an infection partitions be-
tween individual parasite genomes, or how this impacts
disease pathogenesis and treatment. This work will ex-
plore this \black box" in malaria research. It will be a
cross-disciplinary project which combines uorescence
activated cell sorting, single genome sequencing and sta-
tistical genetics approaches to ask key questions about
within-host variation of malaria infections in Malawi
and Thailand. The postdoctoral scientist will report to
Dr. Ian Cheeseman.

versity of Berne is opening 2 new PhD and 1 post-doc
positions in January 2015.
The postdoc position is available for 1 year to model
the pattern of genomic diversity created during range
expansions. A computer simulation framework will be
developed to 1) detect typical signatures of range ex-
pansions at the molecular level and 2) to co-estimate
the distribution of tness eects and the past history of
populations from their patterns of genomic diversity.
The rst PhD position is in evolutionary theory under
the main supervision of Dr. Stephan Peischl. It will
consist in studying the interactions between ecology,
demography and selection at range margins.The second PhD position is in human population ge-
nomics, and will be mainly supervised by Prof. Laurent
Excoer. It will consist in improving methods to de-
tect selection at the gene network level and after range
expansions in humans.
The two PhD positions are available for 3 years.
We are looking for highly motivated individuals with
a good background in population genomics, statistics,
and advanced computational skills, and with strong oral
and written communication abilities.
The CMPG lab is hosted by the Institute of Ecology
and Evolution at the University of Berne, and it oers a
very international and stimulating research environment.
It is also aliated to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformat-
ics (SIB) which oers ample potential for interactions.
Berne is ideally located in the middle of Switzerland
and Europe, and provides rich cultural and outdoor
activities.
The gross salary of the post-doc candidate would be
around 80,000 CHF per year and those of PhD students
around 32,000 CHF, per year. All three positions are
expected to start in January 2015.

*Project Description:*
The evolution of complexity via multicellularity and cell
dierentiation
How and why organismal complexity increases are cen-
tral questions in evolutionary biology. Although the vast
majority of life forms remain simple, both the maximum
and the average levels of complexity have increased from
the origin of life to the present day. Large increases in
organismal complexity resulted from a series of events
in which existing individuals combined to become parts
of a new kind of individual with components specialized
for various roles. Such events are known as major tran-
sitions and include the emergence of cellular life from
groups of interacting molecular replicators, of eukary-
otes from two prokaryotes, of multicellular organisms
from unicells, and of eusocial 'superorganisms' from in-
dividual animals. Among such transitions, the evolution
of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors
set the stage for unprecedented increases in complex-
ity, especially in land plants and animals. We have
used the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii to experimentally generate de novo origins of
simple (undierentiated) multicellularity in two separate
experiments. Using these newly-evolved, multicellular
Chlamydomonas, we plan to ascertain the genetic bases
underlying the evolution of multicellularity, evaluate the
role of genetic assimilation in the evolution of multi-
cellularity, and observe the evolution of multicellular
development in real time.
The successful applicant will be expected to take pri-
mary responsibility for executing the evolution experi-
ments described for this project, and for coordinating
sequencing eorts. Evidence of excellent oral and writ-
ten communication skills and organizational abilities is
required, in addition to a strong interest in evolution,and a willingness to learn new techniques. The post-
doctoral associate will be expected to attend weekly lab
meetings, supervise undergraduate students working on
this project, present research at national and regional
conferences, and to take a lead role in the data analysis
and background research required for timely publication
of research results.
The postdoctoral position will be based at the University

Job Description
A postdoctoral position is available in the Rosenzweig
Lab in the Division of Biological Sciences at the Uni-

ron, uses experimental evolution to explore fundamental
questions in the evolution of multicellular development.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in biology or a related

Project Description: Experimental evolution of multicel-
lularity The evolution of multicellularity was transforma-
tive in the diversity of life; virtually all life visible to the
naked eye is multicellular. Life on earth would be dra-
matically dierent, and morphologically depauperate, if
multicellularity had not evolved. The central question in
this proposal is: Why is the evolution of multicellularity
so repeatable? We have used the unicellular green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to experimentally generate
de novo origins of simple (undierentiated) multicellu-
larity in two separate experiments. The rst is described
in Ratcli, W.C., Herron, M.D., Howell, K., Pentz, J.T.,
Rosenzweig, F. and Travisano, M. 2013. Nature Com-
munications, 4: 2742. Current research focuses on the
evolution of multicellularity in response to lter-feeding
predators. Results from these experiments will be com-
pared with those from similar experiments using other
experimental organisms to address the following ques-
tions: How readily does multicellularity evolve? What
is the tempo and mode in the rst steps in the evolution-
ary transition to multicellularity? Does evolutionary
ancestry substantially impact multicellular adaptabil-
ity?
The successful applicant will be expected to take pri-
mary responsibility for executing the evolution experi-
ments described for this project, and for coordinating
sequencing eorts. Evidence of excellent oral and writ-

gorithms to study the evolution of molecular systems
through gen(om)e duplication under stabilizing, direc-

study the mechanisms by which duplicates in gene reg-
ulatory networks may diverge, and the impact of du-
plications on the origin of emergent system properties
such as robustness and evolvability. The framework
to be developed will also be instrumental in investigat-
ing the impact of neutral versus adaptive evolutionary
mechanisms on the origin of complexity in gene regu-

oratory
http://treethinkers.org Introduction Phylogenetic meth-
ods have revolutionized modern systematics and become
indispensable tools in evolution, ecology and compar-
ative biology, playing an increasingly important role
in analyses of biological data at levels of organization
ranging from molecules to ecological communities. The
estimation of phylogenetic trees is now a formalized sta-
tistical problem with general agreement on the central
issues and questions. A nearly standard set of topics is
now taught as part of the curriculum at many colleges
and universities. On the other hand, application of
phylogenetic methods to novel problems outside system-
atics is an area of special excitement, innovation, and
controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
This Spring, for the sixteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a wide range of topics in comparative phy-
logenetics. The course starts with recent advances in
phylogenetic inference, and then focuses on methods for
making inferences from phylogenies.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the Northern California coast, which has on-site
housing. The course format will involve equal parts of
lecture, discussion, and hands-on software training. One
afternoon during the week will be left free for eld trips
to local natural areas.
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesian
inference of phylogeny * Model specication issues:
model selection, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing
MCMC performance * Divergence-time estimation: re-
laxed clocks, fossil calibration * Species-tree estimation
* Character evolution: ancestral-state estimation, rates
of trait evolution * Lineage diversication: detecting
rate shifts, testing key innovation hypotheses

Huelsenbeck * Michael Landis * Sarah Longo * Mike
May * Brian Moore * Samantha Price * Bruce Rannala
* Bob Thomson * Peter Wainwright
Prerequisites Available housing limits course enrollment
to~30 students. Preference is given to doctoral candi-
dates who are in the early to middle stages of their thesisresearch, and who have completed sucient prerequisites
(through previous coursework or research experience)
to provide some familiarity with phylogenetic methods.
Unfortunately, because of limits on class size, postdocs
and faculty are discouraged from applying.
Admission and Fees Students will be admitted based on
academic qualications and appropriateness of research
interests. The course fee is $750. This includes room
and board at BML for duration of the course (arriving
March 7, leaving March 14) and return transportation
from Davis to the Bodega Marine Labs.

Course on Programming for Evolutionary Biology
When: March 17th - April 2nd 2015
Location: Leipzig, Germany
Application deadline: January 15th 2015
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ \Nothing in
Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"
(Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolutionary biology often
involves the analysis of an unprecedented amount of
information and supports many other disciplines, such
as medicine (evolutionary medicine), behavioral biol-
ogy (evolutionary psychology), ecology, and information
transfer. Scientists have to analyze large datasets, which
requires computational programming skills to design and
apply own ideas into customized algorithms.
In this intensive 17 days course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on experi-
ence in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the eld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a
focus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
\learning by doing", which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as nal projects in small
groups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs of
evolutionary biology or related research elds with no
or little programming experience who want to become
procient in computational evolutionary biology in a
couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the University of Leipzig.

Registration
Dear Colleagues,
The Fifth annual Symbiosis Workshop will take place on
May 1-3, 2015 at the Sierra Nevada Research Station,
Yosemite National Park.
This has become a great venue for a diversity of sym-
biosis researchers, so we hope to continue to attract a
diverse group
Keynote speaker 2015: Dr. Ellen L. Simms from the
University of California, Berkeley.
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our goal is to better integrate scientists that fo-
cus on symbiosis research. We plan to continue annual
workshops at Yosemite as this site is both beautiful and
secluded. This will be our 5th annual meeting and we
are now attracting scientists from all over the country
and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in both
cooperation and symbiosis. In the past we have covered
a range of symbiosis topics from ecology and evolution
to molecular mechanisms in dierent model and non-
model systems. We would like to make room for a
diverse group of people so we will initially accept up to
3 lab members per group (including the PI) on a rst
come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held May 2-
3, 2015, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 1st to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting. Abstract and early
bird registration are due on January 31st, 2015.
Where: SNRS has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room. Costs: See
details in the registration page. We will only be able to
accept credit card payments this year.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although120 EvolDir January 1, 2015
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
