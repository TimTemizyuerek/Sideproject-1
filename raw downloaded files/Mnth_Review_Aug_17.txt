Dear All,
We are convening a topical session entitled \Biodiver-
sity dynamics in the face of environmental change: In-
tegrating paleontological and neontological approaches
to macroevolution" at the 2017 Geological Society of
America conference. The conference will be held 22-
25 October in Seattle, Washington. Our session (T51)
will focus on how environmental changes have shaped
Earth's biodiversity through geologic time and how these
macroevolutionary relationships might be used to un-
derstand the responses of extant species to current and
projected environmental conditions. Invited speakers in-
clude Samantha Price (University of California, Davis),
Andy Purvis (Natural History Museum London), and
Alejandro Ordonez (Queen's University).
If you have a current project that ts the scope of our
session we hope that you will consider submitting an
abstract for consideration. Abstract submission will be
open around April 1st, 2017 and close on August 1. We
are keenly interested in putting together a slate of talks
that span a diversity of disciplinary approaches and in-
cluding presenters from neontological backgrounds who
are interested in incorporating paleontological perspec-
tives into their research. For more information about the
conference: https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Events/-

SAVE THE DATE FOR AGA2018!
We are now planning the next AGA President's Sympo-
sium, to be held at the Hawaii Preparatory Academy in
beautiful Waimea, Hawai'i.
AGA symposia focus on a single topic and last for 2-3
days. They are small, friendly gatherings, and provide
wonderful opportunities for researchers and students to
engage with one another and share their science. The
2018 meeting will examine processes at the early stages
of adaptive radiation, focusing on phenomena such as
admixture, priority eects, and repeated evolution. In-
vited speakers will discuss their research in such areas
as
§The role of allopatry vs sympatry in fostering initial
divergence
§Interplay between isolation and mixing in divergence
and adaptation
§The role of plasticity in facilitating adaptation
§The role and extent of hybridization and admixture,
and at what stage they occur in the evolutionary process
§Repeated evolution of similar forms
§Conditions that facilitate adaptive radiation, and their
relative rates and extents. Details will be available
soon on the AGA website: http://www.theaga.org Best

way for the 2017 meeting on Mobile Genetic
Elements: https://mbl-web.ungerboeck.com/wri/-
wrip1display.aspx?oc=3D10&cc=3DMOBILEDNAAbstract submission deadlines: August 1 for talk
and fellowship consideration; August 12 for poster
presentations.
The 2017 Meeting \Mobile Genetic Elements" in Woods
Hole, MA, USA will take place from Thursday, August
31 to Saturday, September 2 at the Marine Biological
Laboratory (MBL). The meeting will bring together
experimental and computational scientists seeking to
narrow the existing gap between the fast-paced discov-
ery of transposable elements (TEs) in silico, stimulated
by exponential growth of comparative evolutionary ge-
nomic and metagenomics studies, and a limited number
of experimental models amenable to in vitro and in
vivo studies of structural, mechanistic, and regulatory
properties of TEs and their impact on their prokaryotic
and eukaryotic hosts. Special emphasis will be placed
on the evolutionary aspects of TE-host interactions.
The meeting continues the series of bi-annual regional
meetings held since 2007 in Woods Hole and in Cold
Spring Harbor, and now covers a broader swath of the
continent, following the aliation between the MBL
and the University of Chicago. Participants from any in-
terested US and international labs are welcome. Half of
the talks will be selected from submitted abstracts. We
especially encourage abstract submissions from young
scientists at the graduate, postdoctoral, and early-stage
investigator levels. Limited nancial support towards
registration costs will be made available to selected
presenters, as well as to members of under-represented
minority groups. To qualify for reduced registration,
please provide a brief justication to either of the orga-
nizers by e-mail upon abstract submission.
We look forward to welcoming you on Cape Cod!

Do you study how birds are adapting to a rapidly chang-
ing world? We would like to invite you to join us at
Bird Sense 2017 where we will discuss the exibility and
evolutionary potential of birds to respond to shifts in
their environments. We will explore how research on
avian sensory ecology is revealing how birds perceiveAugust 1, 2017 EvolDir 9
the varying landscapes in which they live, and how we
might tackle challenges faced in welfare, conservation
and anthropogenic change.
Birds inhabit every continent of the world and virtu-
ally all available ecological niches, from cities to the
frozen tundra, from tropical rainforests to deserts, and
from mountain ranges to the ocean. They eat fruits
and insects; snails and worms; cereal grains and plants;
mammals and sh; beeswax; sap, and nectar. But in our
human-modied world birds face many challenges their
ancestors did not: the glass fronts of tall buildings, wind
turbines and power lines, articial daylight that turns
night to day; and noisy air trac that moves faster thanany of their natural predators. But birds also cause
conicts for humans: they can be major pests of crops
and cause nuisance in urban settings. Some birds are
thriving; others are struggling.
Together, can we formulate questions, instruments and
analyses to capture how birds make sense of their chang-
ing word?

AuburnU InsectEvolution
Graduate position: Auburn.U.Insect.Evolution
The Hardy Lab at Auburn University (http://-
hardylab.skullisland.info/) is recruiting one PhD
student and one MS student to start in the spring
semester of 2018. Each position will be supported fully
through research assistantships, including a competitive
stipend and tuition waiver.
The PhD student will work on an NSF-funded projectAugust 1, 2017 EvolDir 11
to study the species diversication of aphids in North
America. This will entail phylogeny estimation from
genomic data, niche modeling from geospatial data, and
comparative statistical analyses. Background in any of
these areas would be great, but the only thing that is
required is an interest in the evolution and biodiversity
of insects.
The MS student will study the evolutionary genetics
of host-use adaptation in scale insects. This will entail
a greenhouse-based selection experiment coupled with
transcriptome analyses. No prior knowledge of these
methods is required - just an interest in how plant-eating
insects evolve (or in how gene expression changes with
niche breadth). The experiments have been designed.
What's needed is an enterprising student to do them.
If you are interested (or are interested enough to
want more information) please send an email to Nate
Hardy (n8@auburn.edu) with your CV and few words
about yourself. Applicants must meet requirements
of admission to the Auburn Graduate School (http://-
www.grad.auburn.edu/). There is a rolling admission
system. These vacancies will stay open until lled.

FISHeEST - Using sh environmental DNA to assess
the biodiversity and ecological status of estuarine ecosys-
tems. PhD Annual Stipend: pounds 14, 340
Project Description: Biodiversity is an essential compo-
nent of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to ecosystem
function/services and used to monitor ecosystem health,
both from a regulatory perspective and for nature conser-
vation. In Europe, legislative drivers exist that require
member states to monitor all water body types, includ-
ing socio-economically important estuaries. The Water
Framework Directive and similar future legislation use
a range of biological quality indicators, including sh
as key indicator groups to measure ecological status.
Nevertheless, sh communities are highly challenging to
assess, whether the focus is regulatory biomonitoring,
invasive non-native, or rare species. A variety of netting
and other monitoring methods exist, but all suer from
drawbacks including intensive personnel requirements,
taxonomic or ecological bias, logistical challenges and
in some cases, mortality of sh.
Macrobial environmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA isolated
directly from an environmental sample (e.g. sediment,
or water) and in recent years, a growing number of stud-
ies have shown that the analysis of sh eDNA provides
assessment of sh communities that are as good as, or
better than traditional approaches. Moreover, eDNA12 EvolDir August 1, 2017
techniques oer a number of advantages over conven-
tional techniques including reduced sampling cost, lower
sampling bias, improved detection of a wide range of
taxa and the increased availability of relatively cheap
DNA analysis techniques. While substantial progress
has been made in freshwater ecosystems, the proposed
project here will take the development and deployment
of this tool a stage further into more challenging, but
ecologically critical estuarine habitats.
The aim of this fully funded studentship is the develop-
ment and testing of an operational eDNA method for
monitoring sh communities in estuaries in relation to
biomonitoring, non-native invasive and rare species.
Examples of specic objectives would include: 1. Identi-
cation and development of a suitable laboratory meth-
ods 2. Working with NRW sampling sta, test eld sam-
pling techniques to (i) deliver a cost-eective balance
between the number of samples collected and acceptable
estimates of key metrics and / or detection thresholds;
(ii) provide adequate sampling of biotopes and estuarine
zones to deliver appropriate representation of taxonomic
groups; (iii) identify the most appropriate seasons and
/ or conditions for data collection; 3. Compare eDNA
data with results from conventionally collected surveys
in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of the
various techniques. 4. Evaluate the eectiveness of the
tool for monitoring Habitats Directive and other species
of biodiversity importance in estuaries.
Training will be provided in aquatic eDNA molecular
ecology (DNA extraction, PCR and meta-barcoding),
eld sampling and monitoring, bioinformatics, popula-
tion genetics, statistical modelling and scientic com-
munication. Field work will take place around the
Welsh coastline, potentially extending into the rest of
the UK. The successful candidate will become a highly
skilled, interdisciplinary graduate working at the in-
terface between molecular ecology, environmental sci-
ence and legislation, hosted by the vibrant Molecular
Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Laboratory (http://-
mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/ with Profs. Simon Creer, Gary Car-
valho and Dr. Mathew Seymour) and Natural Resources
Wales (Dr. Tristan Hatton-Ellis), with co-supervision
via Prof. Stefano Mariani (Salford) and Dr. Lori Hand-
ley (Hull).
Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Honours
Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in subjects such as Biol-
ogy, Ecology, Environmental or Natural Sciences, with a
strong motivation to study eDNA biodiversity from a ge-
netic and organismal perspective. Eligibility is restricted
to UK and EU nationals only and candidates with Mas-

GhentU EvolutionGastropods
PhD position Ghent University snail parasites.
Topic: Unravelling the role of Bulinus gastropods as
intermediate hosts in Schistosoma disease transmission
with state-of-the-art molecular techniques
Duration: 3 years with a possible extension14 EvolDir August 1, 2017
Start: October 2017
Vacancy description:
We are pleased to announce a PhD fellowship for a
highly motivated, enthusiastic and independent person
with a keen interest in evolutionary parasitology and
the ecological context of snail-parasite-human disease
transmission in aquatic habitats in Africa. The project
is conceptualized in molecular ecology with a focus on
the intermediate snail host rather than in a biomedical
context. Experience with molecular biology and bio-
informatics, and enthusiasm to participate in eldwork
at transmission sites in Africa are plus-points.
Project background:
Snail-borne diseases aect more than 300 million people
worldwide but also lead to economic losses and mor-
tality in livestock. Especially developing countries are
aected but due to globalization and climate change the
distribution of snail-borne diseases is changing. Because
the distribution of the intermediate snail host species
determines where snail-borne diseases occur, updated
information on snail distribution and their role in par-
asite transmission is highly needed. Acquiring these
insights is however hampered by taxonomic confusion in
the group of host snails and lack of associated ecological
and parasitological data.
The aim of this PhD project is to develop an ecient,
sensitive and robust monitoring tool based on next-
generation DNA-sequencing technology that will simul-
taneously detect the snail and associated parasite DNA.
Applied to new and existing museum collections this
will allow to 1) accurately dene the complete helminth
fauna of each snail species and their role in disease
transmission; 2) combine genetics with morphology to
improve snail identication in the eld; and 3) use snail
and parasite genetic data for comparative phylogeogra-
phy.
Setting and requirements:
The project is funded by the Federal Science Policy of
Belgium and will be developed in an inter-institutional
collaboration between the Royal Museum for Central
Africa (Tervuren, Belgium; Dr. Tine Huyse), Ghent
University (Ghent, Belgium; Limnology Unit, Prof. D.
Verschuren, Dr. Bert Van Bocxlaer), and the Justus-
Liebig University (Giessen, Germany; Prof. Christian
Albrecht). Ghent University is the diploma-granting
institution for this PhD project. Training in the doc-
toral school will take place at Ghent University, whereas
project-related tasks will be primarily developed at the
Royal Museum for Central Africa (Tervuren); language
is English and Dutch. Applicants should hold a master
degree in biology, bio-engineering or biotechnology tobe allowed into the PhD program at Ghent University.
Master students who are graduating during the summer
of 2017 are also welcome to apply.
More information on studying at Ghent University and
living in Ghent can be found on the Ghent Univer-
sity webpage: (https://www.ugent.be/en/ghentuniv;
https://www.ugent.be/en/sta).
Interested?
To apply for this position, please send the following
information to tine.huyse@africamuseum.be: 1) a com-
plete CV, including grades of the last completed year;
2) a short description of past research accomplishments

Ph.D. position: Role of Midichloria mitochondrii, en-
dosymbiotic bacterium of the tick Ixodes ricinus, in thedevelopment of its host Supervisors Dr Olivier PLAN-
TARD (France, Nantes, UMR INRA-Oniris BIOEPAR)
Dr Davide SASSERA (Italy, Pavia, Dipartimento di Bi-
ologia e Biotecnologie, Universita degli Studi di Pavia)
Scientic background In temperate areas of the north-
ern hemisphere, ticks are the most important group of
disease vectors. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus, the most
common tick species, transmits numerous pathogens
including those responsible for Lyme diseases and Tick-
Borne Encephalitis. Vector control against ticks is essen-
tially based on the use of acarides, but its applicability
is reduced for I. ricinus, due to its widespread ecological
distribution and its broad host range, as this species
is capable to feed on numerous vertebrates from both
wildlife and domestic fauna. This tick species harbours
an intracellular bacterium, Midichloria mitochondrii,
vertically transmitted and present with 100% prevalence
of females in natural populations. M. mitochondrii is
unique due to its capability to invade host mitochondria,
but its role in the host physiology is still unknown.
Project description The present Ph.D. project is focused
on understanding the role of M. mitochondrii in the bi-
ology of I. ricinus, towards the development of a vector
control method based on antisymbiotic control.
The rst part of the thesis will aim to evaluate the
eects of Midichloria on I. ricinus tness by the com-
parison of several tick life-history traits between a wild
strain (harbouring Midichloria) versus an aposymbiotic
strain (obtained after antibiotic treatment). A dual
transcriptomic approach will also be conducted to iden-
tify dierentially expressed genes from both the bacteria
and the ticks. A vaccination approach, targeting specic
Midichloria proteins will be conducted on rabbits and
their eect on tick engorgement will be assessed. Skills in
evolutionary biology, parasitology, microbiology, molec-
ular biology and bioinformatics are desiderable and will
be positively evaluated for this Ph.D. project. Fluency
in English is required for the proposed position, as it is
the shared language between the two labs involved in
this project. Fluency in French and/or in Italian will
be helpful but not mandatory.
Funding notes This Ph.D. grant is funded for
3 years by the call of project Vinci of the
Universite Franco-Italienne (https://www.universite-
franco-italienne.org/) and will take place both in
France (Nantes; UMR INRA-Oniris BioEpAR for 24

L-unite2/Groupes-fonctionnel s/TiBoDi ) and in
Italy (University of Pavia; 12 months ; http://-
sasseralab.unipv.it/). The annual gross amount is 21
096 euro.
Applicants should send a CV, a cover letter summaris-16 EvolDir August 1, 2017

KULeuven Belgium
ComputationalPhylogenetics
The Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virol-
ogy (Rega Institute - KU Leuven, Belgium; https://-
rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/) is looking for a motivated
PhD student to perform research in a multidisciplinary
team. This constitutes an exciting opportunity to work
on computational and statistical methods in molecular
evolution with applications in infectious diseases.
Research group
The Evolutionary and Computational Virology Labo-
ratory at the Division of Clinical and Epidemiological
Virology (Rega Institute, KU Leuven) focuses on the
evolutionary processes that shape viral genetic diversity.
This encompasses large-scale epidemic processes, such
as population growth and spatial dispersal (a popular
topic in phylogeographic and phylodynamics research),
as well as small-scale transmission histories and within-
host evolutionary processes, including adaptation andrecombination. It is our objective to gain better insights
into these evolutionary and population genetic processes
and to clarify how they relate to epidemic and disease
dynamics. To this aim we plan to focus on statistical and
computational developments to analyze the increasing
amount of data brought about by massive sequencing
studies, mainly in a framework of Bayesian phylogenetic
inference, for which our research group holds a strong
track record. We also aim to explore the applicability of
novel models and statistical inference tools, developed
as part of our research, in dierent elds of research.
Project
This project focuses on new developments in a popular
Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework (BEAST:
https://github.com/beast-dev/beast-mcmc) and its ap-
plications to important evolutionary problems, with a
particular focus on infectious diseases.
The project involves the development of an integrated
web system and database that allows users to regis-
ter, upload and retrieve sequence data to and from the
database. Each user will be able to determine the shar-
ing policy for the data he/she has provided. Such a
system should be easily distributed so that other re-
search groups can deploy it on their own server(s) and
put it to use without technical interventions. Further,
this system will interface with the BEAST software
package to analyze the sequence data in an ecient
manner. The candidate is expected to design and im-
plement such a system and determine an appropriate
strategy to properly distribute the developed system as
an easily installed/deployed software package.
Additionally, multiple parallelization ideas will be im-
plemented in the BEAST software package. BEAST
is mostly written in Java, with its high-performance
computational library, known as BEAGLE, being im-
plemented in C/C++. The goal is to develop and im-
plement ecient parallelization strategies from both a
computational and a statistical perspective. The com-
putational aspect entails the implementation of pop-
ular routines typically used in computer architecture,
whereas the statistical aspect entails the development
and adaptation of novel transition kernels in a Bayesian
phylogenetic inference framework.
Prole
The candidate for this PhD position should have a
strong quantitative background, and preferably holds
a master's degree in computer science / informatics
(or equivalent through experience), with an interest in
statistics/mathematics and (bio)informatics. The candi-
date hence needs to be experienced in an object-oriented
programming language such as Java or C/C++. TheAugust 1, 2017 EvolDir 17
candidate should be suciently procient in English,
motivated to work in a team and publish his/her nd-
ings, and willing to travel.
Oer
The candidate will be able to perform research in a dy-
namic and multidisciplinary team (computer scientists,
data analysts and evolutionary biologists), housed in the
brand new facilities of the Rega institute at the Univer-
sity hospital campus, and guided by prolic supervisors.
KU Leuven is one of the top universities in Europe and
leads the Reuters ranking of Europe's most innovative
universities for the second year in a row.
The targeted starting date will be October 1st 2017
and the candidate should obtain his/her master's degree
by that time. All applicants are expected to submit a
motivation letter, overview of their study results and
two references (with their contact details).

dure, can be found here: https://icts.kuleuven.be/apps/-

Apply by 21st July
We are pleased to announce two opportunities available
for a start from mid to late 2017
1: Adapting to a foreign climate: the reproductive ecol-
ogy of the house sparrow in Australia The house sparrow(Passer domesticus) was introduced into Australia in the
1860's and has since become well established across a
broad range of climates in both countries. This project
will take advantage of this 'experimental' introduction
to focus on behavioural and physiological adaptations
to dierent climates through a eld-based comparative
approach. This research will complement our existing
work on related questions in endemic Australian species
and will provide insight into the capacity of avian species
to adapt to changing climates. This project will involve
periods of eld-work in Broken Hill, Armidale and Ho-
bart in Australia, along with a range of behavioural,
molecular and physiological assays. The project will
involve collaboration with other groups in Australia and
the US.
2: The challenge of growing in a hot climate (in the
zebra nch) In recent years we have characterised the
very hot conditions in which zebra nches are raised
(with nests regularly exceeding 40 degrees (C)), as well
as identifying adverse eects of these conditions on em-
bryonic development, ospring growth, and adult sperm.
This project will investigate the adaptations that this
iconic and well-studied species has to deal with the ex-
treme climate in which it lives. The project will take a
variety of approaches including behavioural work, and
assays of metabolism and physiology. The research will
combine eldwork and laboratory work. The project
will be run in collaboration with Dr Christine Cooper
(Curtin University, Western Australia), Prof. Pierre
Deviche (Arizona State University, US), and Prof. Pat
Monaghan (Glasgow, UK).
Both of these projects are supported by ARC Discovery
Project funds.

How bright and how nasty: the economics of variable
aposematic traits
Supervisors: Hannah Rowland, MPI for Chemical Ecol-
ogy; Jon Blount, University of Exeter, UK
Deadline for application: August 18, 2017
More information: http://imprs.ice.mpg.de/ext/-
index.php?id=home Supervisors: Hannah Rowland,
MPICE; Jon Blount, University of Exeter, Penryn Cam-
pus.
Background: Many species of animals, plants and micro-
organisms have evolved to use defensive chemicals to
reduce the likelihood of being ingested by predators
(Ruxton, Sherratt, & Speed, 2004). Aposematic species
advertise these chemical defences with conspicuous or
distinctive colours (Poulton, 1890). This paring of visual
and chemical cues causes predators to learn about prey
more quickly (Gittleman & Harvey, 1980), remember
them for longer (Roper & Redston, 1987), and make
fewer discrimination errors (MacDougall & Dawkins,
1998). Warning colours are selected for their reliability
as an indicator of defence (Sherratt, 2002) - a qualita-
tively honest signal. What is much less clear, however,
is whether variation in conspicuousness within or among
species provides ne-grained information about levels
of defence - a quantitatively honest signal (Summers,
Speed, Blount, & Stuckert, 2015).
There is a growing body of theoretical and empiricalAugust 1, 2017 EvolDir 21
evidence that warning colours can be related in some
way to the defence that it advertises (Blount, Speed,
Ruxton, & Stephens, 2009; Darst, Cummings, & Can-
natella, 2006; Leimar, Enquist, & Sillentullberg, 1986;
Summers & and Clough, 2001). This project will focus
on testing the link between warning colours and chem-
ical defences. You will investigate how prey optimize
their aposematic defences by quantifying a set of tness
costs and benets.
Project Description: You will test the predictions of
Blount et al. (2009). They proposed a 'resource compe-
tition' model to explain variability in aposematic traits.
The premise of this model is: if sequestration or pro-
duction and maintenance of aposematic defences and
conspicuous signals compete for access to a shared phys-
iological resource (for example, antioxidant molecules),
then in low resource states, prey are predicted to invest
equally in conspicuousness and defence. This would re-
sult in a positive correlation between these traits, which
would indicate honest signalling. There will be two
avenues of research:
1. Are aposematic defences costly to generate?
Aposematic signals sometimes incorporate structural
colours, for example in butteries, but invariably they in-
clude pigments such as carotenoids, avonoids, melanins,
ommochromes, papiliochromes, pteridines and por-
phyrins. Such pigments have a long-chain conjugated
polyene structure, which absorbs visible light and im-
parts colour, but also deactivates reactive oxygen species
(ROS) that arise due to electron leakage during ATP pro-
duction. If antioxidant defences become overwhelmed by
ROS (i.e. oxidative stress), serious damage is sustained
by DNA, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Plant
secondary metabolites are commonly sequestered and
utilised for chemical defence by insects; such allelochemi-
cals are powerful pro-oxidants. It has been hypothesised
that toxin-sequestering insects therefore require robust
antioxidant defences if they are to avoid oxidative stress.
Similarly, species that produce their own secondary de-
fences may risk oxidative stress caused by metabolic
expenditure for foraging, toxin (or weapon) production
and storage, as well as direct pro-oxidant eects of toxins
(Blount et al. 2009).
You will test the fundamental assumptions of the re-
source competition model (Blount et al. 2009): (1) that
aposematic displays are costly in terms of fecundity,
(2) that secondary defences can incur oxidative stress;
and (3) that oxidative stress can reduce the capacity of
individuals to produce aposematic displays.
2. Are aposematic defences costly to use?
Key work by Endler and Mappes (2004) examined therole of variation in predator responses to aposematic
prey. It is one of the few recent theoretical treatments
to consider variation in aposematism in detail. You will

Munich CrustaceanEvolution
Doctoral position - Palaeo-Evo-Devo of malacostracan
crustaceans
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to take
part in the investigation of the evolutionary history of
malacostracan crustaceans, including extant and fossil
representatives. The project is funded by the German
Research Foundation (DFG).
The project is based on an interdisciplinary approach, in
which developmental data of extant and fossil species are
incorporated into an evolutionary framework, shortly
referred to as palaeo-evo-devo. The major data base is
provided by morphological investigations of extant and
fossil specimens with modern imaging methods. Data
are interpreted in a strict phylogenetic framework.
Focus groups of research are isopods and meiuran de-
capods. Both groups exhibit a large diversity of mor-
phology and developmental patterns and have a rich
fossil record. Specimens will be provided via scientic
collections, eldwork is not considered.
The prospective PhD student does not necessarily need
to have experience with the imaging methods or system-22 EvolDir August 1, 2017
atic groups mentioned above, but is expected to gain
expertise early in the course of the project. The project
includes a distinct amount of traveling to collections in
Germany and abroad. The results of the project are
expected to be presented regularly at national and in-
ternational conferences by the prospective PhD student
as well as published in peer-reviewed journals.
The successful candidate will be based in the work group
of Functional Morphology of Animals at the campus
Martinsried south-west of Munich, in close proximity
to Munich. Child care facilities as well as schools are
nearby.
We oer: DFG-funded PhD position (75%) for 36

AphidLandscapeGenetics
10 days left to apply to this exciting PhD to study
landscape genetics of pest aphids and applying it to
improving pest management. *Deadline 10 July
*A full Waitrose - BBSRC CTP funded PhD position is
open to work on population genetics and the evolution
of resistance in aphids. The project is a collaboration
between Rothamsted Research, University of Warwick,
and G's, a leading lettuce producer.
\Using landscape genomics to improve management of
insect pest species"
Insect pests have a widespread negative impact in agri-
culture, resulting in very large economic loses. Moni-
toring and surveillance of pest species is fundamental
to control their populations and reduce the damage
they inict on crops. This is because an early detection
improves the chances of controlling them before they
spread out and increase their population size. However,
studying the migration of small insects can be prob-
lematic due to the diculty of tracking individuals. In
addition, resistance to pest control methods, whether
to insecticide or to host-plant resistant cultivars, is be-
coming an increasingly important issue. Inferring the
population structure of pest species and the connectivity
across populations and landscapes is key to understand
migration patterns, which can be used to inform pest
surveillance and control schemes. This fully-funded
project provides an exciting opportunity to apply popu-
lation genomics and evolutionary concepts to improve
insect pest management and understand the evolution
of resistance.
The project will use /Nasonovia ribisnigri/, the currant-
lettuce aphid, as a model system to evaluate how land-
scape genomics can be used to improve aphid surveil-
lance and control the spread of resistance alleles. The
currant-lettuce aphid, /Nasonovia ribisnigri/, is a ma-
jor pest of lettuce crops responsible for large economic
losses. One of the most ecient way to reduce aphid
infestations and damage is growing host-resistant let-
tuce cultivars that stop aphids from colonising the plant.
However, the capacity of breaking the host-plant re-
sistance mechanism (Rb) has recently evolved in some
biotypes. In these circumstances, surveillance and mon-
itoring of crops becomes of great importance to produceAugust 1, 2017 EvolDir 23
early warning information that would improve targeted
control of /N. ribisnigri /before aphids enter the lettuce
head. However, the paradox is that whilst winged aphids
are quick to colonise the lettuce crop in spring they are
unusually scarce in both water traps and suction traps.
Understanding the migration patterns of the species
is, therefore, fundamental to design ecient methods
of capture and control. For this, the project will use
genomics to infer the population structure and the lev-
els of gene ow between populations of /N. ribisnigri/
at dierent geographic scales and dierent landscapes.
This knowledge will be used to develop surveillance
methods that maximise the observation of individuals
of the species at the early stages of their migration into
the crops. Furthermore, these results combined with
the development of genome-wide markers for the Rb
phenotype will provide fundamental information about
the evolution and spread of resistance across the UK.

date is October 2017. *

ComputationalEvolGenomics
PhD in Computational Biology
Applications are invited for a PhD position to work
with Dr. Carolin Kosiol at the Centre of Biological
Diversity of the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.
Starting date will be the 27th September 2017 or shortly
thereafter. The position will be funded for 3.5 years.
The PhD project is part of a larger project en-
titled \Genome-wide molecular dating" (https://-
www.wwtf.at/programmes/mathematics/MA16-061)
The recent sequencing of genomes of closely related
species and of many individuals from the same species
enables the study of speciation and the inference of the
history of populations. Standard phylogenetic methodsreduce entire populations to single points in genotypic
space by modelling evolution as a process in which a
single gene mutates along the branches of a phylogeny.
In this project, we envisage developing new theory and
software to tackle the problem of species tree estimation
and molecular dating genome-wide. Visits to Vienna,
Budapest and Aarhus for collaborations with Gergely
Sz oll osi and Asger Hobolth are possible.
The successful candidate should have a strong interest in
applying quantitative methods and modelling to Biology.
They will have a degree in Bioinformatics, Computer
Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or a related
eld. Prior experience with either population genetics
or comparative genomics is a benet. Preferably the
candidate will have experience in programming language
such as C, C++, Java and a scripting language such as
Python or Perl.
To receive full consideration, applicants should submit a
single PDF le by e-mail with the following items before
August 15 to ck202@st- andrews.ac.uk : * A cover letter
with a brief summary of previous research experience

MicrobialFungalEvolution
Two PhD positions are available in the Goddard Lab
at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Both
projects will use a combination of next-generation DNA
sequencing to evaluate aspects of microbial community
ecology and population biology and understand how
this relates to fungal populations associated with
vines and winemaking. These projects will build
on a body of work in this area at the University of
Auckland (http://www.goddardlab.auckland.ac.nz),August 1, 2017 EvolDir 25
be strongly aligned with the Vineyard Ecosystem's
program (https://www.nzwine.com/en/innovation/-
innovation-new-zealand-wine/vineyard-ecosystems/),
and collaborate strongly with Plant and Food Research
(http://www.plantandfood.co.nz) and New Zealand
Winegrowers (https://www.nzwine.com/en).
Project 1 - Microbes beyond the soil
There is signicant market and industry desire to pro-
duce wine in ways that maximises the quality and dis-
tinctness but does so using environmentally respon-
sible methods that minimise impact and increase the
longevity of vineyards. The MBIE Vineyard Ecosystems
(VE) programme makes a paradigm shift and takes a
holistic approach and focusses on a core set of sites and
evaluates the impact of two main management styles on
vineyard health, quality and longevity.
However, the VE programme does not consider the ef-
fects of these dierent management approaches on the
microbial biodiversity on ripe fruit and the resulting
juice. This is important as these microbial communities
play a role in dening the complex mix of compounds
that aect wine aroma and avour. This project will fo-
cus on Sauvignon blanc due to its economic weight and
that we understand these systems best in terms of micro-
bial ecology and wine chemistry. While Saccharomyces
yeasts are the main species that drive fermentation,
the range of other species that dominate on ripe fruit,
in juice and early ferment also aect key avour com-
pounds. This project proposes to evaluate the species
present on ripe grapes and see if and how these might
change leading up to harvest, into the winery and early
ferment. Importantly the project will evaluate how vine-
yard management might aect these communities and
their eect on a key set of esters and thiols.
Project 2 - Integrating habitats in the vineyard ecosys-
tem
The wine industry and the public in general are inter-
ested in ways to produce wine that maximises ecological
sensitivity and sustainability yet produces high quality
products. Our scientic understanding of how dierent
agricultural approaches aect ecosystems as a whole is
growing, but large gaps in our knowledge persist. The
MBIE Vineyard Ecosystem program addresses some of
these gaps, and is evaluating the eect of 'conventional'
and 'future' management approaches on vineyard ecosys-
tems across six years. Microbes and invertebrates are an
important aspect of vineyard ecosystems as these dene
disease pressure (there are fungal, bacterial and insect
pests and diseases), fruit quality, and, once in the win-
ery, fermentation dynamics and wine quality (especially
if spontaneous ferments are used). The MBIE program
only has resources to evaluate biodiversity in soil as aproxy for the vineyard ecosystem; however, our very
recent work shows that at a single time point in Sauv
ignon blanc: 1) microbial diversity diers among habi-
tats in vineyards (soil, vine-bark, and ripe fruit); 2) that
management approaches aect the diversity in each of
these habitats dierentially; and 3) that biodiversity in
juice and thiols in nal spontaneously fermented wines
do not dier by management approach. Whether this
pattern holds across multiple years, dierent regions
and dierent varieties is thus worthy of investigation.
We propose to do this here. Such a project will produce
solid academic outputs and valuable information for
growers and winemakers regarding the eects of man-
agement on vineyards ecosystems and the quality of the
wine deriving from these, and thus is precisely aligned
with the MBIE Vineyard Ecosystem program.
Formal application should comprise a CV and covering
letter to Dr Sarah Knight by 1st August at wineresearch-
network@auckland.ac.nz.
Please state which project you prefer, but we
will also consider combined applications to both
projects. Informal enquires may be addressed to
both Dr Sarah Knight and Prof Matthew Goddard
(m.goddard@auckland.ac.nz).

UAuckland PlantAnimalInteractions
PhD Scholarship available: Sensory ecology of a resilient
ancient deceiver, the Splachnaceae dung mosses (The
University of Auckland, New Zealand)
How do plant-animal interactions survive and adapt
in a changing world? The extraordinary Splachnaceae
mosses grow on animal carcasses and dung, and use
bright colours and rotten odours to lure ies into acting
as spore dispersers. Splachnaceae are generally hosted
by the remains of native mammals, e.g. in Australia,
they grow on dung from wombats, wallabies and Tas-
manian Devils. Splachnaceae specimens have also been
found with preserved mammal remains, e.g. giant Irish
deer and Canadian caribou.
In New Zealand/Aotearoa, the biota is bird dominated
with no native land mammals ?C the Splachnaceae
mosses are now hosted by introduced mammals, e.g.
goats. Could Aotearoa Splachnaceae's original hosts be
extinct moa or other herbivorous birds like takah c or
putakitaki? Or seal or seabird colonies? Which insects26 EvolDir August 1, 2017
are fooled into dispersing Aotearoa Splachnaceae? Our
pilot data suggests dung beetles may be an extra courier
here.
This project aims to use behavioural ecology, chemi-
cal ecology, spectral modelling, paleoecology and an-
cient DNA to discover how mosses mimic the scents
and odours of dung to deceive spore-dispersing insects,
switch between bird, mammal, native and introduced
hosts, as we explore how networks can respond to in-
troduced species and megafaunal extinctions. There is
scope to develop the project to suit your interests and
aspirations as you develop your career.

HostPathogenChemicalCoEvolution
The Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences,
Faculty of Science at University of Copenhagen is oer-
ing a PhD scholarship in Host-pathogen co-evolution to
work in the Section for Organismal Biology. The 3-year
position is expected to commence 1 December 2017. |
Description of the scientic environment | The De-
partment of Plant and Environmental Sciences (PLEN)constitutes a highly competitive, stimulating, and inter-
national research environment. The PhD project will be
carried out within the research theme Host-pathogen co-
evolution in the research group of Insect-Pathology and
Biological Control aliated to the Section of Organismal
Biology (SOBI). SOBI provides a highly dynamic envi-
ronment with a long history of studying host-pathogen
interactions in a number of systems, ranging from insect,
mammal and plant hosts to pathogenic fungi, bacteria,
and macroparasites. We pursue internationally compet-
itive excellence in a multinational research environment
where English is the working language. The PLEN
research laboratories are located at the Frederiksberg
Campus of the University, close to the centre of Copen-
hagen, one of the most liveable cities of the World. |
Project description | Transmission to new suscepti-
ble host is crucial for a pathogen, and the biological
world is rife with examples of pathogens that manipu-
late host behavior to enhance host transmission. This
mind-control can go beyond the infected host and for
example exploit the mate-seeking behavior of healthy
males that becomes signicantly more attracted to in-
fectious females than uninfected females. The project
will use a newly established laboratory host-pathogen
system of the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae
and Dipteran insect hosts for exploring the pathogen in-
duced alterations in host chemistry, including chemical
analysis and electro-antennal responses to -volatile com-
pounds and dual-transcriptomics of host and pathogen.
The research is fundamental with considerable applied
potential in attract-and-kill biological control strategies.

ComputationalPaleogenomics
PhD position in Computational Paleogenomics Statis-
tical and Computational Evolutionary Biology Group,
Prof. Wegmann University of Fribourg, Switzerland
Who we are: We are a young, international and enthu-
siastic group at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland,
aiming at characterizing the evolutionary and ecological
processes shaping the realm of biological diversity we see
today. To achieve this, we design and evaluate new sta-
tistical and computational approaches to infer complex
evolutionary histories and subsequently, apply them to
the wealth of data currently being generated, primarily
from the latest sequencing approaches. A recent focus
of the lab was on the development of tools to analyze
next-generation sequencing data that properly account
for genotyping uncertainty resulting from low-depth and
post-mortem damage prevalent in ancient DNA.
Your tasks: Currently, we seek a highly motivated PhD
student to join our research group and to address ques-
tions regarding large scale population movements inhuman history and pre-history using ancient DNA. For
this the successful candidate will develop new and extend
existing population genetic methods, and in particular
model-based inference tools, for ancient DNA data, and
then apply these tools to newly generated data sets.
This work will be mostly of a statistical and computa-
tional nature, involving explicit modelling, simulations
and data analysis, yet there is also an option to con-
tribute to data generation with our collaborators in a
dedicated paleogenetic laboratory at the University of
Mainz, Germany.
What we oer: We oer a stimulating research environ-
ment, well embedded in the strong evolutionary- and
population genetics community in western Switzerland.
We are part of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics
(SIB) and boost excellent research facilities, including
state-of-the-art high-performance computational infras-
tructures. Fribourg is a lively university town with
pleasant surroundings (such as the Alps) and an excel-
lent quality of life. It is located only 20 minutes from
the capital of Switzerland, Bern, and just a little over an
hour from Geneva and Z urich. While some knowledge of
German or French is benecial for living in Switzerland,
it is not essential. The working language in our lab and
institute is English.
What you bring: Applicants for this position should have
a Master degree (or equivalent) in biology, population
genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, computational biol-
ogy, computer science, statistics or a related eld. Good
knowledge of written and spoken English is expected.
While experience in programming is not required (but
an asset), we expect candidates to be highly motivated
to acquire skills in programming and statistical infer-
ence, for which we are happy to provide state-of-the-art
training.
The position is fully funded with a competitive salary
for three years, with the possibility to extend by one
additional year. The successful candidate should ideally
start in October 2017, or soon thereafter.
To receive full consideration, applicants should submit a
single PDF le by e-mail with the following items before
August 15 to daniel.wegmann@unifr.ch:
* A cover letter with a brief summary of previous re-
search experience and motivation for the position. *

UIceland SpeciationEvolReprodBar
PhD position in biology, Institute of Life and Environ-
mental Sciences, University of Iceland
A full PhD position in biology is open for applications, at
the Institute of Life and Environmental Sciences for the
project: Evolution of reproductive barriers in sympatric
Arctic charr morphs.
How is phenotypic integrity maintained in the face of
gene ow? What is the eect of hybridization on develop-August 1, 2017 EvolDir 31
ment and tness? What are the molecular mechanisms
behind hybrid incompatibilities? These and related ques-
tions will be addressed by a team of researchers, and a
capable PhD student responding to this advertisement.
The project The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) of
Lake Thingvallavatn is ideally suited to address these
questions. The Lake was formed at the end of the last
glacial epoch just 11-10 thousand years ago and despite
its young age it now harbors four morphs of Arctic
charr, whose distinct variation in life history character-
istics, behavior and trophic morphology suggest rapid
adaptive diversication, possibly followed by or caus-
ing build-up of reproductive barriers. The focus of
this project will be on the two smaller Thingvallavatn
morphs, planktivorous- (PL) and small benthic-charr
(SB), which have diverged along the limnetic - benthic
ecological axis, and inhabit dierent parts of the lake.
Breeding populations of both morphs are large and their
spawning overlaps spatially and temporally seemingly
presenting ample opportunities for cross-mating. Yet,
population genetic studies show that they constitute
distinct populations, which suggests eective reproduc-
tive barrier(s). We intend to cast light on the nature of
these barriers. The central hypothesis underlying our
investigation is that reproductive isolation between SB
and PL Arctic charr is partly due to strong negative se-
lection against hybrid ospring and/or dierences in the
exact timing of spawning (i.e. time of the day), precise
spawning location and/or mating behavior. The Ph.D.
project^ a euro s aims are to: i) Assess hybrid survival and
tness during embryonic and early larval development
ii) Study gene expression during development of hybrid
and pure morph crosses iii) Study the spawning behavior
of the two morphs and their interaction in the wild and
in the lab. The applicant must have completed an M.Sc.
degree in Biology or related elds from a University ap-
proved by the University of Iceland's Graduate School.
Those with an advanced degree including at least a 60
ECTS credits thesis project will be given precedence.
Diving experience is a plus.
We are seeking a student with dedication, drive and
good theoretical background in evolution, developmen-
tal and molecular biology and an interest in animal
behavior. The work involves planning and executing
sampling in the eld, acquisition and analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data and numerical analyses,
designing laboratory experiments. The position will
be at the University of Iceland and the work will take
place there. Experts at the University of Aberdeen,
Scotland and the Holar University College, Iceland, will
also participate in the project. Application deadline
is 1st of August 2017. The PhD study should be com-
pleted within four years of full time study. The PhDstudent may be involved in teaching, for two semesters
maximum. The selected candidate will have to formally
apply for PhD studies at the University of Iceland in due
time. Applications should be submitted here: https://-
ugla.hi.is/radningar/index.php?sid=2448&starf=192 ac-
companied by i) a letter of intent (maximum two pages)
explaining interest in working on this project, the rea-
son to pursue a PhD, hopes to gain and learn during
the PhD studies and what makes them suitable for this
project ii) CV, iii) transcripts of university diplomas,
courses taken at bachelor and masters level, iv) degree
project thesis and vi) names and contact information
of two persons that could provide letters of references.
The student will join the Arctic charr group at the In-
stitute of Life and Environmental Sciences, under the
supervision of Sigurdur S. Snorrason, Arnar Palsson
and Zophonias O. Jonsson. The Arctic charr group
consists of several PhD students and senior personnel,
and has collaborators in Iceland, Denmark, Scotland
and Canada. The combined expertise covers population
ecology and genetics, molecular biology and bioinformat-
ics. At the institute we have well equipped molecular
biology labs, and instruments and computer pipelines
for high throughput sequencing, are accessible there or
at collaborating centers. For further information con-
tact: Kalina H. Kapralova (kalina@hi.is) or Sigurdur S.

UMelbourne BeetleEvolution
PhD Project Available (Commencing 2018) School of
BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Aus-
tralia, 3010
I am seeking a PhD student to join an interdisciplinary
project involving thermal adaptations, colour, near-
infrared reectance properties, and nano-structures in
beetles. The project is funded by the Hermon Slade
Foundation and the University of Melbourne. I am par-
ticularly keen to recruit students with a background
or interest in the interface between biology and optical
physics.
Project description
Animals have evolved remarkable and unique ways of
controlling light (e.g. uorescence, iridescence). Un-
til now, biologists have focused almost exclusively on
how ultraviolet (UV) and human-visible wavelengths
are manipulated to produce the diversity of colours and
optical eects we see in nature. However, the way near-
infrared wavelengths of sunlight are controlled to aect
body temperature is critical to survival; yet the adaptive
signicance of near-infrared variation remains almost
entirely unexplored in animals.
This project will characterise near-infrared variation
in leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) and reveal its adaptive
signicance using experimental approaches. The project
will also reveal how the nano-scale architectures of bee-
tle cuticles control UV-visible and near-infrared light,
enabling them to balance camouage, communication
and thermal requirements. Discovery of nano-structures
to manipulate near-infrared light has exciting potentialbiomimetic applications.
Requirements
Successful applicants will be assisted in applying for an
Australian Postgraduate Award (for Australians) or an
International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (for
Internationals) through the University of Melbourne. To
be competitive, a First-class Honours or Masters Degree
(or international equivalent) or publication in interna-
tional journals are essential. Please send applications
by 1st October or earlier.
To apply, please send A) A brief letter outlining your
research interests; B) a CV, C) your academic tran-
script/grades, D) contact details of two referees (includ-
ing a previous research supervisor).

SexualCompetition
PhD Student Position - UNSW Sydney: Economic in-
equality as a driver of sexual competition and gendered
traits
This is an exceptional opportunity for students inter-
ested in how evolved traits interact with economic cir-
cumstances to shape behaviour in contemporary soci-
eties. Students may be trained in evolutionary biology,
psychology, anthropology, economics or other disciplines.
This position is supported by the generous Scientia PhD
Scholarship Scheme at UNSW Sydney, Australia. In
addition to a stipend of $40K p.a. There is a $10k p.a.
Travel allowance, and other opportunities for career
development.
The supervisory team is: Professor Rob Brooks - evo-
lutionary biology A/Prof Pauline Grosjean - economics
Dr Khandis Blake - evolutionary social psychology
DESCRIPTION: We propose to test the exciting new
idea that economic inequality among households also
shapes mating competition, giving rise to many of thestark sex dierences in dress, spending patterns, and
mental and physical health that pervade societies. While
wealthy Western countries have progressed steadily to-
ward gender-equitable opportunities over the last cen-
tury, dierences between women and men in aggression,
interests and the incidence of diseases like anxiety and
depression have, paradoxically, increased. It is clear
that ossied old ways of understanding gendered traits
as either biologically essential or socially constructed
have little to oer in terms of further understanding.
Our approach transcends old territorial boundaries, and
promises a newer, better and more general way to under-
stand gendered behaviours, including those implicated in
harm to mental health, safety, and happiness. The work
will involve both experimental psychological research
and analysis of economic data.
The project will be designed in collaboration between
student and supervisors. There may be opportunities
for eld work in Australia or the Pacic.
This is a highly competitive scheme, with excellent sup-
port, open to students from any country. Interested
students must express interest by 21 July (20 July in
the Western hemisphere due to time dierences). To
earn more and to express interest visit:

ogy. Bowdoin is located in coastal Maine with con-
venient access to a diverse range of natural habitats
including meadows, forests of diering species compo-
sition, the Gulf of Maine, the White Mountains and
the major rivers that drain them, Merrymeeting Bay
(a large freshwater tidal system), urban centers, and
agriculture. The College maintains three unique eld
sites in support of teaching and research: the Coastal
Studies Center, a 114 acre preserve on Harpswell Sound,
which includes a owing seawater laboratory and small
boat eet; the Bowdoin Scientic Station on Kent Is-
land in the Bay of Fundy; and 260 undeveloped acres
of sandplain grassland, oak-pine forest and pitch pine
heath barren adjacent to campus.

Cairns VolunteerFieldAssistant
Volunteer eld assistant
We are looking for eld assistants to help monitor nests
of a small bird, large-billed gerygone for PhD project
(Australian National University, Canberra). The main
objective of this research is to gain a better understand-
ing of the breeding ecology of large-billed gerygone, and
the coevolution between large-billed gerygone and littlebronze-cuckoo. Research will be conducted in Cairns
region, Queensland, Australia. We will be based in
Cairns city, and travel to several sites in this area. Vol-
unteer eld assistants are needed from *15 Sep to 15
Nov, 2017*. The exact dates are exible but need to be
around this time.
Overall duties will include nest searching and lming,
behavioral observations, and data entry. The large-bill
gerygone build nests over the water, and the height of
nests varies from 1m to 5m. The study site is rugged,
hot, and venomous snakes and ticks are quite common.
Working days are long, with early starts, six days a week.
Therefore, applicants must have good physical tnessAugust 1, 2017 EvolDir 63
to walk along the creek with a heavy ladder, withstand
harsh conditions at the site, and maintain an energetic
attitude despite long hours in hot and humid conditions.
Work schedules and duties will vary, so exibility is
necessary. Previous experience with eldwork is highly
desired, and handling eggs and chicks is also preferred,
but a positive attitude is much more important than
tons of eld experience.
Food and housing will be provided, and assistants will
enjoy fantastic wildlife viewing opportunities, proximity
to Queensland rainforest and the surrounding area of
Cairns. Please feel free to enquire with any questions
related to the application process or on the project in
general.
To apply, send a cover letter detailing interests, previous
relevant eld research experience, dates of availability
and a CV to Hee-Jin Noh (hjnoh891@gmail.com).

Fish internal fertilisation answers
Dear All
Internal fertilisation in an egg-laying sh
Some months ago I asked whether anyone was aware
of any records of internal fertilisation of eggs in nor-
mally egg laying sh species. What I meant by that
was records of embryos inside the ovaries of normally
oviparous females. Thank you to those who responded.
Although there are quite a number of sh species with
internal fertilisation (viviparous), it appears that records
of this occurring in species that normally lay eggs are
extremely rare. The only well documented one that I
have found is in the Japanese cottid sh Hemilepidotus
gilberti, in which the embryos fail to develop properly,
see:
Hayakawa, Y., Munehara, H., 2001. Facultatively inter-
nal fertilization and anomalous embryonic development
of a non-copulatory sculpin Hemilepidotus gilberti Jor-
dan and Starks (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae). J. Exp.
Mar. Biol. Ecol. 256, 51- 58.
and
Hayakawa, Y., Munehara, H., 2003. Comparison of
ovarian functions for keeping embryos by measurement
of dissolved oxygen concentrations in ovaries of copula-
tory and non-copulatory oviparous shes and viviparous
shes. 295, 245- 255.

Help with kSNP3 problem
REQUEST FOR HELP WITH kSNP3 PROBLEM Dur-
ing the last year many of you have contacted me about
problems with kSNP3 when trying to annotate genomes.
The problem appears to be the result of NCBI discon-64 EvolDir August 1, 2017
tinuing the use of GI numbers in sequence les as of a
year ago.
Shea Gardner, who was the author of kSNP3 (and its
earlier versions), died last year at the end of February.
I am condent that Shea would have dealt with this
problem promptly and eciently. Sadly, I am a much
less skilled perl programmer than was Shea, and I have
been unable to solve the problem.
I have been able to determine that, provided that
the reference genome les use the new style header
(>accesion number) rather than the old-style header
(>gijnumber), the problem is conned to the anno-
tate SNPs from genbankFiles3.pl script. Despite the
lack of gi numbers in the new-style header kSNP3 still
downloads the full genbank les that are to be used for
annotation.
Fortunately, it is not necessary to run the entire kSNP3
program in order to test the correct operation of the
annotate SNPs from genbankFiles3.pl script.
If you are willing to try to x anno-
tate SNPs from genbankFiles3.pl please email me
(barryghall@gmail.com) and I will happily send you
everything you need to have a go at xing it.

have temporarily stopped producing it.
Does anyone know of an alternative supplier of fresh

Opinions On ThermalCyclers
Hello all,
I have a grant to purchase 4 thermal cyclers for my
group. It was originally envisioned that this would be a
set that could be daisy-chained together (e.g. Eppen-
dorf MasterCyclers), however, these are all very large
units and space is a major constraint for us. We have
settled on 3 other models with smaller footprints but
would like to solicit opinions/reviews from anyone who
has experience with them (particularly in terms of ease
of use, reliability, and overall longevity).
1) BioRad T100August 1, 2017 EvolDir 65
2) ABI/Life Technologies SimpliAmp
3) PCRMax AlphaCycler4 (seems to be the only tetrad
unit on the market- I am especially interested in anyone
with experience in this system as it doesn't seem to be
very common in North America).

Soil Sampling In Alaska
Hi,
I am reaching out to obtain soil samples from an eleva-
tional gradient in Alaska. I would need soil samples from
grasslands located at altitudes of 1000m, 2000m and
3000m AMSL (if 3000m is not possible then altitudes
of 500m, 1000m and 2000m would be ne as well). For
each grassland, eight replicate samples of about 300g
of soil should be taken at 10-20cm depth. If possible,
thermologgers (which I will provide) should be burried
for 1 year at the 3 elevation sites. Shipping of samples
will be arranged and all costs will be covered by my lab.
Considering the involved sampling eort, co-authorship
on a publication resulting from this work will be oered.
Contact me if you are interested in helping out or if you
need further details!
Thanks in advance,

VisualizingGenomicData Sep11-15
Visualizing genomic data: techniques and challenges.
The advent of Next Generation Sequencing technologies
has allowed the rapid production of massive amounts of
genomic data, and created a corresponding need for new
tools and methods for visualizing and interpreting these
data in order to extract relevant biological information.
Visualizing genomic data requires more than simplyplotting data. It requires a decision: what message
should be conveyed by a particular plot? And, it often
presents a choice: which methodologies should be used
to represent the results in an easy, clear and accurate
way to the users? Interpretation and visualization of
genomic data, often consisting of thousands to billions of
data points, and extracting biological meaning remains
a serious challenge.
We will run a workshop on Genomic Data Vi-
sualization and Interpretation (Sept 11-15, 2017;
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course14/) https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course14/ with the twin scientists
Dr. Malachi Grith (Malachi's website http://-
www.malachigrith.org ) and Dr. Obi Grith (Obi's
website http://www.obigrith.org ), who lead a
combined research group (The Grith lab) at the
McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University.
They will be joined by Mr. Zachary Skidmore, a sta
scientist in their group and expert in genomic visualiza-
tion. The Grith lab's research is focused on developing
methods of applied bioinformatics for genomic data
analysis, personalized medicine and improved cancer
care. They have participated in dozens of genomic
studies from the earliest sequencing of full-length human
genes and whole genomes, initial surveys of the muta-
tional landscape of multiple cancer subtypes, and some
of the rst proof-of-principle applications of sequencing
to cancer precision medicine. They have a strong
commitment to developing open-source tools and knowl-
edgebases for cancer gene and variant interpretation
including pVAC-seq (github.com/grithlab/pVAC-Seq
https://github.com/grithlab/pVAC-Seq ), CIViC
(http://civicdb.org ), DGIdb (http://dgidb.org
), and DoCM (http://docm.info ). They
are also the creators of GenVisR (bioconduc-
tor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenVisR.html
https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/-
GenVisR.html ), a Bioconductor package, which
provides a user-friendly, exible and comprehensive
suite of tools for visualizing complex genomic data for
multiple species of interest. In this Workshop we will
explore a number of best-in-class visualization tools,
and we will provide working examples that demonstrate
important principles of omic interpretation strategies.
Participants are encouraged to bring their own experi-
mental design ideas and data from recent experiments
to discuss with the team of instructors who have collec-
tively participated in hundreds of diverse data analysis
projects.
Here we have the possibility to discuss this topic with
them:68 EvolDir August 1, 2017
* You are both leading the Grith Lab - could you please
tell us about the dierent research topics of your group?
How has the combination of your dierent bioinformatics
skills and knowledge been important in accomplishing
scientic objectives and key results?
Our lab's activities can be divided into four broad cate-
gories: cancer genomics studies, personalized medicine
eorts, bioinformatics tool development, and educa-
tional eorts such as this workshop. Our group con-
ducts data analysis of a wide array of data types. Major
sources of data include whole genome, exome and RNA-
seq. We are also involved in many projects that involve a
wide variety of custom gene panel assays. We are increas-
ingly working with T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing
and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequence data. We don't
focus on a particular cancer but have many projects
involving AML, lung, head and neck cancer, liver cancer,
and breast cancer. To help translate results from these
next generation sequencing assays to clinical application
we develop open source tools and online resources for
interpretation of data in a personalized genomics con-
text. These include the drug-gene interaction database
(http://www.dgidb.org ), the database of curated muta-
tions (http://www.docm.info ), the personalized Variant
Antigens by Cancer Sequencing (pVAC-seq) pipeline

at Emory University.
I* am especially looking for people who are interested
in developing new approaches for learning the evolu-
tionary dynamics of viral and microbial populations
from large-scale sequencing. I've been lucky enough to
start collaborations with some great experimental and
observational groups, but now there's way more to be
done than I can handle by myself. The current projects
range from fairly well-dened ones to ones where the big
challenge is even guring out what questions to ask, so
postdocs would be able to reliably build a track record
while also thinking about new directions that they could
use to start their own careers as independent researchers.
While data analysis is the most urgent need in the group
right now, I'm also very happy to hire people who would
prefer to focus more on pure theory, including but not
limited to evolution on tness landscapes and the in-
teraction between adaptation and spatial structure and
their eects on genetic diversity. Ideally, everyone in
the group gets to do a mix of theory and analysis.
If you're interested and would like to hear more about
the specics, please email me. Successful applicants will
have a PhD and a strong publication record in evolution-
ary theory, theoretical physics, statistics, or a related
eld. I am particularly interested in candidates with
a track record of scientic creativity and independent
thinking. Review of applications will begin immediately
and will continue until the positions are lled. Please

within the Mobilitas Pluss funded project \Unravelling
the Estonian genome: the whole is greater than the sum
of its parts" (see description below).
Research project short description: Recent advances in
the eld of ancient human genetics showed that the gene
pool of Estonians, as elsewhere in Europe, is the sum
of various evolutionary histories that met in the region
after the Ice Age. Each of these human groups, how-
ever, carried dierent genetic variants with potentially
dierent consequences on the physiology and genetic
makeup of modern Estonians. With the present project
the whole genome sequences of 2500 modern Estonians
recently generated at the Estonian Genome Centre will
be subdivided into their ancestral components. These
components will be screened for their burden of genet-
ically causative variants (from a catalogue of GWAS
and literature hits). Given the uniqueness of modern
Estonian genomes, this approach will shed light on the
evolutionary bases that form the present disease burden
in the region.

EvolutionOfHumanAging
Postdoc position in Citizen Science and Evolution of
Human Aging
The Department of Biology and Max Planck Odense
Center on the Biodemography of Aging invite applica-
tion for a position in human aging research working on a
citizen science project. The position is funded within the
Open Data Experimentarium (ODEx) and will initially
run for a period of 13 months, starting September 2017
or soon thereafter. Application deadline: 15 August
2017.
Human life expectancy rises by about two years per
decade. Despite intensive aging research we have only a
limited understanding of the underlying aging process
that allows such lifespan extensions. Are longer lives sim-
ply achieved by delaying aging, or has the wear and tear
process behind aging slowed? Such fundamental ques-
tions will be studied by the dierence between perceived
age (how old one looks) and chronological age (how
old one is) as a biomarker. The core of project builds
on a citizen science project, AgeGuess.org, in which
more than 3750 citizen scientists currently participate.
The citizen scientists have uploaded over 4700 facial
images and guessed an impressive 200000 times the age
on the images, analyzing this data and expanding the
project by launching targeted campaigns and publicly
outreaching will be the main task of the post-doc.
Job description The successful applicant will be expected
to work on a citizen science project, AgeGuess.org, by
conducting and publishing international research in the
eld of human aging research with focus on biomark-
ers of aging comparing chronological and perceived age,
and statistical analysis of such data collected by citizen
scientists. We also expect the applicant to be centrally
involved in outreach activities and launching targeted
campaigns to increase the involvement of citizen scien-
tists in the project.
The applicant will work in a multi-disciplinary, interna-
tional team of biodemographers, evolutionary biologists,
health-scientists, economists, computational biologists,
and biostatisticians.
Major requirements - A PhD in natural, health, techni-
cal or social sciences or comparable - Research in the
mentioned disciplines, preferably across disciplines, witha strong quantitative component - A proven interest in
the fundamentals of human aging - Experience in teach-
ing and outreach activities - Grant writing experience.
It is expected that the new postdoc participates in under-
graduate and postgraduate teaching and in supervising
of students and researchers.
Other requirements - Excellent communication and in-
terpersonal skill - Excellent statistical and analytical
abilities - A computer language such as R, Python, or
similar is required. Applicants from computer science
are particularly welcome. - Fluent English language
skills - Ability to work independently as well as in mul-
tidisciplinary teams - A strong team player.

The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Gradu-
ate University (OIST) is a model for change in education
and research with the best international graduate stu-
dents, working side by side with world-class faculty in
modern well-equipped laboratories. Beautifully situ-
ated on the island of Okinawa, OIST relies on a cross-
disciplinary approach, with an emphasis on creativity
and exchange, to oer unique, individualized graduate
training. OIST is a university with no departments,
eliminating articial barriers between people working
in dierent elds, but many nationalities, with students
and faculty being attracted from all over the world. Con-
centrating initially on Neuroscience, Molecular Sciences,
Mathematical Sciences, Environmental and Ecological
Sciences and Physical Sciences, OIST is bringing some
of the best brains in the world to Okinawa to transformthe way science and education is done in the global
academic world.
Position summary:
The Evolutionary Genomics Unit is seeking for a post-
doctoral researcher with background in ecology and
evolution, and with ability to analyze high through-
put sequencing data. The researcher will work around
on one or more of these promising topics: molecular
evolution of the symbiosis between insects and microor-
ganisms, molecular phylogenetic of insects and their
microorganisms, historical biogeography of termites.
Position:
The Evolutionary Genomics Unit is a research group
recently established at OIST with interests in evolution
of insects in general. Our main research topics include
molecular evolution of the symbiosis between insects
and microorganisms, molecular phylogenetic of insects
and historical biogeography of termites. We address all
these themes using high throughput sequencing. OIST
possesses cutting edge sequencing facilities, equipped
with high throughput sequencing, including Illumina
Hiseq 2500, Hiseq 4000, Miseq, and PacBio. We are
looking for a postdoctoral candidate with extensive ex-
perience in high throughput sequencing and who is keen
to work on one of our insect models: cockroaches or
termites. The candidate is expected to work in collab-
oration with members of the Evolutionary Genomics
Unit, and she/he will be given relative independence to
develop her/his own research within the frame of the
Unit's research agenda.
Some possible research topics include, but are not re-
stricted to:
- Studying the role of termite gut microorganisms in
soil-feeding termites using metagenomic analyses. Many
species of termites feed on soil but they are not studied
as intensively as wood-feeding termites. Metagenomics
can help us understanding the function of these microor-
ganisms.
- Studying the evolution of genome reduction in the cock-
roach endosymbiont Blattabacterium. Most cockroaches
are associated with Blattabacterium, a bacterium that
recycles nitrogen wastes and provides amino acid to their
host. The number of genes varies between strains of
Blattabacterium, and one question is therefore what are
the factors responsible of gene erosion in some strains?
- Studying the historical biogeography of termites using
molecular phylogenies. Termites are distributed world-
wide and often make up a large part of animal biomass
in the tropics. We are studying the origin of their dis-
tribution using mitochondrial genome phylogenies, to80 EvolDir August 1, 2017
determine the timing and direction of their spread across
the globe.
- Studying the coevolution between termites and their
microorganisms. The gut of termites host 1000s of bacte-
rial species participating to the degradation of wood and
other organic compounds. Gut bacteria are inherited
from parents, or are acquired by transfer from other
sources. We aim to determine the respective role of
vertical inheritance versus horizontal transfer in shaping
the termite gut bacterial communities.

Princeton University (www.mallarinolab.org). The lab
focuses on uncovering the genetic and developmental
mechanisms by which form and structure are generated
during vertebrate embryogenesis. We combine the study
of emerging and traditional model organisms to explore
questions relating to patterning and evolution of nov-
elty in the mammalian skin. The lab uses a variety of
approaches, including experimental embryology, genet-
ics, genomics, imaging, and mathematical modelling to
uncover gene function and understand mechanisms of
evolutionary change.
The lab is currently focusing on two model systems:
striped rodents and gliding mammals. Available projects
include:
- Spatial control of genes implementing stripe patterns
- Molecular mechanisms of stripe pattern specication
- Comparative genomics and evolution of pigment pat-
terns
- Molecular mechanisms of gliding membrane formation
and evolutionary genomics of gliding
While the position entails working on one of these areas,
the candidate is expected/encouraged to take a leading
role in the conceptual and experimental design of the
project. In addition, there will be signicant opportu-
nities for pursuing original ideas that fall within the
general focus of the lab.
Applicants with a strong background in developmen-
tal biology, genetics/genomics, and/or molecular/cell
biology are encouraged to apply. A Ph.D. in these disci-
plines is preferred, but candidates holding a Ph.D. in
other areas that have strong laboratory and/or bioinfor-matics skills will also be considered. Prior experience
with experimental embryology, cell/tissue culture, and
microscopy would be very benecial. However, neces-
sary training will be provided for a motivated candidate.
Excellent oral and written communication skills and the
ability to work independently or in collaboration are
essential.
To apply for this position please submit a CV, a cover
letter describing research interests, and contact infor-
mation for three references who can comment on your
research to rmallarino@princeton.edu. Applications will
be reviewed promptly until the position is lled. Prince-

Postdoc position: long-term trends in protein evolution
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna Masel
(http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at the Uni-
versity of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist des-
tination surrounded on all four sides by mountainous
national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city of
nearly a million people with an attractive climate. The
EEB department was ranked in the top 10 by US News
& World Report.
We recently found that genes of dierent ages encode pro-
teins with dierent computationally predictable struc-
tural properties, forming an extraordinarily long-term
trend. This project will use bioinformatics techniques
to discover whether these long-term trends are really a
consequence of evolution by descent with modication
that continues for long periods of time in a consistent di-
rection. More details of the project, including preprints
of preliminary ndings, are available upon request.
Techniques used may include phylostratigraphy (assign-August 1, 2017 EvolDir 89
ing ages to gene families), ancestral sequence recon-
struction, and porting macroevolutionary techniques
for studying speciation and extinction to the study of
gene duplication and loss. A high level of statistical
sophistication is required throughout.
Excellent computer programming skills are strongly pre-
ferred, ideally with bioinformatics / genomics and statis-
tics experience. Exceptionally strong candidates who
come from a more experimental background within evo-
lutionary biology, and who now wish to retrain as bioin-
formaticians, will also be considered. A background
in evolutionary biology is also strongly preferred, al-
though again, exceptionally strong computational sci-
entists from highly quantitative backgrounds outside
evolutionary biology will also be considered. Statistical
knowledge, and knowledge about protein structure and
folding, are advantages. Start date is negotiable, and

UCambridge 2 Evolutionary Theory
Two post-doctoral research associate positions in the De-
partment of Zoologe are available to work with Professor
Rufus Johnstone on mathematical and computational
modelling of the evolution of inheritance and life history.
|{
Position 1, Evolution and inclusive inheritance
Available from 8 August 2017 for up to 31 May 2019.
The position is part of the world's largest project
to expand our understanding of evolution. The Ex-
tended Evolutionary Synthesis project, involving a
multi-national, interdisciplinary consortium of 51 world-
renowned experts, with funding from the John Tem-
pleton Foundation, aims to explore new ways to think
about and understand evolutionary phenomena.
The PDRA will work on modeling three mechanisms
of inclusive inheritance: (i) social transmission (explor-
ing how social learning and teaching changes across
the life-cycle), (ii) epigenetic inheritance (investigating
how maternal investment and resource transmission im-
pacts on subsequent health and development), and (iii)
ecological inheritance (considering how environmental
modulation and niche construction generate group dif-
ferences in behaviour). There is, however, scope for
the focus of the modelling to reect the interests of the
candidate.
Duties will include developing models, using a combi-
nation of game theoretical and adaptive dynamic tech-
niques, possibly supplemented by individual-based sim-
ulations, and analysing and writing up the results.

Position 2, Life history evolution
A post-doctoral research associate position in Depart-
ment of Zoology, located in Central Cambridge on Down-
ing Street, is available from 7 August 2017 or as soon
as possible thereafter for up to eighteen months, to
work with Professor Rufus Johnstone on mathematical
and computational modelling of life history evolution in
banded mongooses.
The PDRA will work on integrating trans-generational
costs of reproduction into models of life history evo-92 EvolDir August 1, 2017
lution, and exploring the strategies that breeders may
adopt to ameliorate these costs. We are interested in
i) the circumstances under which selection favours par-
ents that incur costs themselves in of trans-generational
damage on their ospring, ii) how this trade-o mod-
ulates investment in other life history traits, and iii)
how investment in shielding of young, and consequently
ospring quality and subsequent life history, may be
expected to change with parental age. There is, how-
ever, scope for the focus of the modelling to reect the
interests of the candidate.
This work will be carried out as part of a NERC-funded
project, in collaboration with Dr Jon Blount and Prof
Michael Cant at the University of Exeter, who will be
collecting data on trans-generational costs of reproduc-
tion in wild banded mongooses, which will be used to
inform development of the models and to test their
predictions.

http://explore.jobs.u.edu/ (job number 502790)General project summary:
Seabirds have the longest migrations on earth and can
travel 8 million km in a lifetime, yet how they navi-
gate across a seemingly featureless ocean is still one of
the greatest puzzles in nature. Evidence from mam-
malian and insect systems shows that animals adjust
their behavior in response to infrasound and a handful
of studies have suggested pigeons may use infrasound
for navigation. These low frequency sound waves can
propagate over hundreds of kilometers, creating \hills"
and \valleys" of an infrasoundscape that birds may use
to navigate, like a topological map. When combined
with meteorological and oceanographic models, these
maps can be modeled to create real time soundscapes
that individual seabirds could use in movement decisions
over spatial scales. By combining a network of 60 in-
ternational atmospheric infrasound and hydro-acoustic
monitoring stations that detect signals from around the
globe with a database of over 15,000 seabird movement
tracks, we will have a unique opportunity to explore the
role of atmospheric and oceanic infrasound in naviga-
tion, respectively for aerial and aquatic species. The
mechanisms allowing animals to detect low frequency
sound has been identied in other taxa, and our study
will examine how seabird sensory organs may capture in-
frasound. The development of an innovative movement
framework grounded in landscape ecology will allow us
to assess determinants of large-scale movement, notably
the eect of infrasound in directing migration and com-
muting trips in the open ocean. Furthermore, novel
biologging devices, which can detect sound and mete-
orological parameters, will be used to simultaneously
capture movement, infrasound and weather conditions
to examine individual movement decisions at ne scale.
Finally, interspecic comparisons will assess the relative
importance of infrasound for seabird navigation, with
respect to phenotypical and phylogenetic dierences,
thus oering a complete assessment of the physiology,
behavior and physics underpinning the use of infrasound
in navigation.

ModellingPhenotypicEvolution
Post-doc in mathematical modelling on phenotypic evo-
lution and embryonic development:
1.Job/project description:
The postdoc could choose between three main research
projects:
a. Mathematical modeling of phenotypic evolution in
populations with embryonic development.
b. Mathematical modeling of gene network and embry-
onic development evolution.
c. Mathematical modeling of organ development and
their evolution in mammalian teeth or Drosophila wing.
The actual project will be chosen together with the
candidate depending on his/her interests and skills.
The research will take place in the Isaac Salazar-
Ciudad's group in the Center of Excellence in Experi-
mental and computational developmental biology of the
Biotechnology Institute of the University of Helsinki.
The job is for 1 year and renewable for 1 extra year.
2. Background:
The process of embryonic development is now widely ac-
knowledged to be crucial to understand evolution since
any change in the phenotype in evolution (e.g. morphol-
ogy) is rst a change in the developmental process by
which this phenotype is produced. Over the years we
have come to learn that there is a set of developmental
rules that determine which phenotypic variation can
possibly arise in populations due to genetic mutation
(the so called genotype-phenotype map). Since natural
selection can act only on existing phenotypic variation,
these rules of development have an eect on the direction
of evolutionary change.
Salazar-Ciudad's group is devoted to understand these
developmental rules and how these can help to better
understand the direction of evolutionary change. The96 EvolDir August 1, 2017
ultimate goal is to modify evolutionary theory by con-
sidering not only natural selection in populations but
also developmental biology in populations. For that aim
we combine mathematical models of embryonic devel-
opment that relate genetic variation to morphological
variation with population models. The former models
are based on what is currently known in developmental
biology.
Salazar-Ciudad's group is in close collaboration with
Jukka Jernvall's group and other groups within the cen-
ter of excellence in experimental and computational de-
velopmental biology. The center includes groups working
in tooth, wing, hair and mammary glands development.
In addition to evolutionary and developmental biologists
the center of excellence includes bioinformaticians, pop-
ulational and quantitative geneticists, systems biologists
and paleontologists.
\The Academy of Finland's Centres of Excellence are the
agships of Finnish research. They are close to or at the
very cutting edge of science in their elds, carving out
new avenues for research, developing creative research
environments and training new talented researchers for
the Finnish research system."
3. Requirements:
The applicant must hold a PhD in either evolutionary
biology, developmental biology or, preferably, in evolu-
tionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Applicants
with a PhD in theoretical or mathematical biology are
also welcome.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.
The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.
4. Description of the position:
The fellowship will be for a period of up to 1+1 years
(100% research work: no teaching involved).
Salary according to Finnish postdoc salaries.
5. The application must include:
-Motivation letter including a statement of interests
-CV (summarizing degrees obtained, subjects included
in degree and grades, average grade).
-Summary of PhD project, its main conclusions and its
underlying motivation.
-Application should be sent to Isaac Salazar-Ciudad by
email:
isaac.salazar@helsinki.No ocial documents are required for the application
rst stage but these may be required latter on.
6. Deadline:
There is no specic deadline, the position will be lled
as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

UKansas PopulationModelling
Dr Daniel Reuman is recruiting into his lab in the Univer-
sity of Kansas Department of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology (EEB). At least 3 years of funding are available
to carry out modelling pertaining to spatial population
dynamics and analysis of large spatial population data
sets. The postdoc will join an interdisciplinary team
consisting of Reuman, three postdocs and one student
currently in the Reuman lab, collaborators in EEB and
in the Math Department at KU, and collaborators at
several institutions in the USA and UK. Funding is from
the NSF Mathematical Biology program and the James
S McDonnell Foundation.
In many hierarchical dynamical systems, \synchrony"
between multiple uctuating variables, i.e. correlations
or other similarities in uctuations between variables
through time, is more important than the individual
variables themselves. For instance, a neuron may re
only when its input neurons re synchronously. Or the
electrical grid may crash only when demands of multi-
ple users become synchronized, producing total-usage
spikes. Ecosystems can show this type of dependency on
synchrony. Ecosystems include multiple trophic levels,
with population signals from lower levels often being
spatially aggregated to aect higher levels. For instance,
a predator is only harmed if its prey are scarce overits whole hunting area. For systems of this type, it is
primarily the synchronous components of signals that
matter in the average signal that aects the next level
- non-synchronous components tend to cancel in the
spatial average. Thus synchrony is very important to
ecosystems. Synchrony is found in organisms as diverse
as mammals and protists, at distances up to thousands
of kilometers. Synchrony relates to large-scale outbreaks
and shortages and is important in conservation. In spite
of the importance of synchrony in ecology, possible im-
pacts of climate change on synchrony are little studied.
Synchrony can also be transmitted through trophic in-
teractions - e.g., a synchronized predator can induce
synchrony in its prey. But the extent to which climate-
induced changes in synchrony may cascade through
species interaction networks via this mechanism, or in-
uence spatial or other branches of ecology, is unknown.
The postdoc will perform statistical and/or mathemati-
cal population modelling to address these questions, and
will investigate connections to extinction risk models
and to Taylor's law, a commonly applied empirical regu-
larity in spatial ecology. The postdoc will be encouraged
to develop his/her own projects within the goals of the
funding grants.
We seek individuals from biological or physical-science
backgrounds with skills and demonstrable interests in
modelling and related areas. Experience with stochastic
process modelling and Fourier or wavelet approaches is
a plus. Experience with population models is a plus,
as are computational skills, particularly if applied in a
statistical or modelling context. A PhD or ABD in a re-

NSF Funded Postdoctoral Position
A two-year postdoctoral position is currently available in
the Knowles Lab, in collaboration with Jeet Sukumaran
and Craig Moritz, to work on statistical and conceptual
issues regarding species delimitation. Specically, the
postdoc will work as part of the joint eort aimed at
(i) developing a new approach that couples the multi-
species coalescent with dierent diversication models
for Bayesian statistical inference, with (ii) applications
of genetic-based delimitation. Although the postdoc will
not be required to program, the ideal candidate should
have a quantitative background (e.g., experience with
scripting and analysis of large genomic datasets) and
conceptual interest in species delimitation. Given that
the postdoc will be responsible for conducting analyses
for extensively evaluating the general performance of
the new modeling approach through simulated datasets,
as well applications to existing datasets on Australian
squamates, the postdoc should have experience conduct-
ing coalescent simulations. The postdoc will be based
in Ann Arbor; however, as part of the collaborative
project, will also be engaged in outreach activities that
include workshops and public engagements in both the
USA and Australia.
Please send CV and inquires to L. Lacey Knowles

WolbachiaEvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral Positions Available Cooper Lab, University
of Montana brandonscooper AT gmail
Postdoctoral scholars are sought to join the laboratory of
Brandon S. Cooper in the Division of Biological Sciences
at the University of Montana. Positions are funded by
the NIH and expected to start on or after September
1; however, start dates are negotiable. Our group is
focused on understanding the origin, spread, and main-
tenance of maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria
in several (N ~20) Drosophila systems. We believe
that the diversity of experiences and ideas that we each
bring to the lab improves our ability to answer our ques-
tions. Thus, we encourage qualied individuals from all
backgrounds to apply.
The positions - Postdoctoral research will be broadly
focused on determining Wolbachia eects on host physi-
ology and tness that facilitate Wolbachia spread. Infec-
tions could be old and co-diverging with their hosts. In
contrast, hybridization with sister species or horizontal
transfer could lead to contemporary between-species
Wolbachia spread. Once Wolbachia infect host lineages
they often spread rapidly to high frequencies. For ex-
ample, the wRi variant that infects D. simulans took
over most of the Australian continent in about a decade.
Yet how Wolbachia interact with their hosts to spread
so rapidly remains mostly unknown. Postdocs will push
back the frontiers of knowledge about the origin, spread,
and maintenance of Wolbachia infections in Drosophila.
Desired skills - A variety of projects are available that
will enable postdocs to leverage their existing expertise
while learning new skills. For example, we would be
equally happy to recruit evolutionary biologists with
expertise in molecular genetics, cell biology, bioinformat-
ics, and/or evolutionary genetics. Some projects will
evaluate genomic variation, some will evaluate pheno-
typic variation, and others will assess cell-level variation
in Wolbachia abundance. While our approaches are102 EvolDir August 1, 2017
diverse, all projects seek to make progress towards our
primary goal of understanding how Wolbachia infections
spread to become common. Anyone interested should
contact me directly (brandonscooper AT gmail).
The pay - Postdoctoral scholars will be paid according
to the NIH stipend levels, which is currently $47,484 for
rst year postdocs. You can live quite comfortably on
this salary with the reasonable cost of living in Missoula,
MT. Postdocs will be initially appointed for one year,
but up to three years of funding is available for postdocs
making sucient progress.
Our lab at UM - We share a new 5000 ft2 lab space
with Zac Cheviron, Lila Fishman, Je Good, John Mc-
Cutcheon, and Scott Miller, which generates an excep-
tional intellectual microenvironment. Several other labs
interested in evolutionary genetics and host-symbiont
interactions are nearby making UM a wonderful place
for completing our goals. Postdocs will interact heavily
with these labs in addition to our collaborators at other
universities.
Life in Missoula - Missoula is located along the Clark
Fork River in western Montana. Within minutes of our
lab you can hike a mountain, oat down a river, y sh,
or relax at any of the nearby breweries/coee shops.
We work hard, but we also enjoy life, and Missoula is a
good place to do both.

Postdoctoral Research in Plant Population Genomics
The Juenger lab at the University of Texas at Austin
is recruiting a postdoctoral position in population ge-
nomics to work on DOE funded research. The focus
of the research is to explore the genetics and genomics
of adaptation in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a
native C4 perennial grass. The project is a multidisci-
plinary eort including ecologists, physiologists, genomic
scientists and modelers. Our collaborative project is
generating a number of exciting datasets ranging from
high throughput phenomic descriptions of plant mate-
rial to genome-scale polymorphism data. A major aim
is to understand the natural diversity and evolutionary
history of switchgrass. To this end, we have developed
a diversity panel of hundreds of natural accessions that
have been resequenced and are being utilized in common
garden studies. The candidate will likely be involved
in studies of demographic history, population structure,
adaptive molecular evolution, and association studies of
ecologically-important traits.
The position requires a PhD in Evolution, Population
Genetics, Genomics, Plant Biology, or a related eld.
The ideal candidate will have experience in bioinformat-
ics, population genomic modeling and inference, and
statistical analyses of genome-wide polymorphism data.
We are looking for highly motivated candidates with ex-
cellent communication skills, initiative, and enthusiasm
for large collaborative team eorts. Our diverse research
eort oers an ideal scenario for cross-disciplinary train-
ing, leveraging existing datasets and resources, leader-
ship opportunities, a creative work environment, and
avenues for applied impact in the development of sus-
tainable biofuels.
Austin is the state capital of Texas, an inland city border-
ing the Hill Country. Home to the University of Texas,
Austin is known for its eclectic live-music scene, sizeable
tech sector, and SXSW Conference. Its many parks and
lakes are popular for nearly year-round hiking, biking,
swimming and boating. Austin boasts approximately
300 days of sunshine per year and is America's fastest
growing city. https://hr.utexas.edu/prospective/austin

Postdoctoral Research in Statistical Genetics
The Juenger lab at the University of Texas at Austin is
recruiting a postdoctoral position in statistical genetics
to work on NSF and DOE funded research of native
perennial C4 grasses. The candidate will be involved in
projects exploring ecological and evolutionary genetics
using switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) as a model sys-
tem. The project involves a multidisciplinary team of in-
vestigators including ecologists, physiologists, modelers
and genomic scientists. A major theme of the research is
the study of gene-by-environment interaction, ecological
and evolutionary tradeos, and the evolution of adap-
tive trait sets in natural plant populations. A central
goal is to identify genes underlying local adaptation
and ecotypic dierentiation across species ranges. The
Juenger lab has longstanding interests in quantitative
genetics, gene-by-environment interaction, and the ge-
netic architecture of ecologically important traits. Over
the last decade we have developed a number of resources
for studying quantitative genetics in perennial grasses
include diversity panels, mapping populations, and com-
mon garden plantings. Our funded projects leverage
existing gardens spanning 10 locations across the latitu-
dinal species range of switchgrass (from Texas to South
Dakota). The candidate will likely be involved in sta-
tistical genetic projects including genome-wide complex
trait analysis (gREML), genetic mapping (outbred QTL
and GWAS), and genomic selection in plant breeding.
The position requires a PhD in Evolution, Population
Genetics, Genomics, Statistical Genetics, Plant Biol-
ogy, Plant Breeding or a related eld. We are looking
for highly motivated candidates with excellent com-
munication skills, initiative, and enthusiasm for large
collaborative team eorts. Our diverse research eort
oers an ideal scenario for cross-disciplinary training,
leveraging existing datasets and resources, leadership
opportunities, a creative work environment, and avenues

function, gene expression, and population genomic sig-
natures of selection associated with changes in salinity.
This postdoc project will entail conducting population
genomic analyses along temperature and salinity gra-
dients in the wild, and during selection experiments in
the laboratory.
A key advantage of the E. anis system is its short
generation time (20d), ease of culturing large numbers
(thousands per population), and ability to generate in-
bred lines. We have a full genome sequence of E. anis
and several reference transcriptome sequences. Addition-
ally, the multiple independently-derived environmental
clines enable the observation of parallel evolution.
The ideal candidate should hold a Ph.D. and have publi-

Course: Assembly and Annotation of genomes
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course20/ 12-16 February 2018, Berlin (Germany)
Instructor: Dr. Thomas D. Otto (University
of Glasgow, UK; https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
instructors/t28/) https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
instructors/t28/ Overview
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the concepts of de novo assembly and anno-
tation. Dierent technologies, from Illumina, PacBio,
Oxford Nanopoor and maybe 10X will be used mixed
with dierent approaches like correction, HiC scaolding
to generate good draft assemblies. Particular attention
will be given to the quality control of the assemblies
and to the understanding how errors occur. Further,
annotation tools using RNA-Seq data will be introduced.
An outlook of potential analysis is given. In the end of
the course the students should be able to understand
what is needed to generate a good annotated genome.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learning
more about genome assembly and annotation. It will
include information useful for both the beginner and
the more advanced user. We will start by introducing
general concepts and then continue to step-by-step de-
scribe all major components of a genome assembly and110 EvolDir August 1, 2017
annotation workow, from raw data all the way to a
nal assembled and annotated genome. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
command line Linux.
Attendees should have a background in biology. We
will dedicate one session to some basic and advanced
Linux concepts. Attendees should have also some famil-
iarity with genomic data such as that arising from NGS
sequencers.
Session content
Monday 12th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \get it
starting"
Session 1: Introduction (morning)
In this session I will kick o with an introduction lecture
about genome assembly and annotation - the past, the
present and the future. I will use this introduction to
motivate the ve-day course. Next, I will explain the
use of the virtual machine (VM), and the use of cloud
computing. This is followed by short introduction to
Linux (although I would prefer if student know a bit
of Linux). Through the morning we will kick o our
rst assembly and put it through an annotation tool
(Companion).
Session 2: Visualization (half afternoon)
During this afternoon, we are going to visualize the
assembled and annotation genome from this morning
in Artemis. The aim is to use the viewer to inspect the
annotation, correct annotation and write out les. Next,
we are going to perform a comparative exercise, (compar-
ing the genome from the morning with a close reference)
to understand the concept of syntheny, breakpoint or
errors.
Session 3: Mapping
In this module, I will teach the basics of read mapping.
We will map reads with bwa mem onto a reference and
will examine duplications and errors through not proper
mapped read pairs. This is important to exanimate
the correctness of assemblies and will be used later the
week.
Tuesday 13th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \learn it
the old way"
Session 4: De Brujin graph and PAGIT
This module is dedicated to short read assembly. Al-
though it might be superseded due to long reads, under-
standing the concept of short reads and De Brujin graph
is crucial. After a seminar about this subject, we will
assemble the same genome as before, but this time with
Illumina: de novo assembly with velvet, contig ordering,
error correction. Through comparative genomics we aregoing to look at errors in the assembly, and how they
could be found with remapping short reads, and also
split long reads. Last, we are going to compare the
assembly to the assembly from Monday. This session
will go into the afternoon of Tuesday.
Session 5: RNA-Seq
In this session, we will analysis the transcriptome of the
sample we assembled so far, motivated through a little
talk. In the exercise, we will map RNA-Seq reads, (short
and long reads) understanding rst the basics of RNA-
Seq, but then will use the reads to correct gene models.
We will discuss the concept of alternative splicing.
Finally, we will annotate our assembly with Augustus,
using the mapped RNA-Seq data and some manually
corrected genes.
Wednesday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \do it
yourself"
Session 6: Large genome assembly
First we are going to kick o an assembly of a larger
genome, and let it run in the cloud over the day and
the night. It will be important during the day to check
if the assembly is still running.
Session 7: Group Taks I
Group task I: You will get a set of reads (from a ran-
dom technology) and need to generate a draft genome
assembly. Due to time restriction,

Berlin GenomicVisualizationsInR
Sep11-15 deadline
Workshop title: Genomic Data Visualization and Inter-
pretation
11th-15th September, Berlin (Germany)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course14/ Application deadline is the 10th of August
2017.
Topic: Advanced R and bioinformatics applications for
visualization and interpretation of genomic data.August 1, 2017 EvolDir 111
Instructors:
Dr. Obi Grith (http://obigrith.github.io/; Washing-
ton University School of Medicine, USA),
Dr. Malachi Grith (http://malachig.github.io/; Wash-
ington University School of Medicine, USA)
Mr. Zachary Skidmore (Washington University School
of Medicine, USA)
Course overview
The advent of rapid and relatively cheap massively par-
allel sequencing has dramatically increased the availabil-
ity of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome proling.
Analysis workows and published best practices are
also now available to process raw sequence data into
alignments, variant calls, expression estimates, etc., in
relatively standardized le formats. Interpretation and
visualization of these data, often consisting of thousands
to billions of data points, and extracting biological mean-
ing remains a serious challenge. In this workshop we will
explore a number of best-in-class visualization tools, and
provide working examples that demonstrate important
principles of 'omic interpretation strategies.
Workshop format
The workshop will be delivered over the course of ve
days. Each day will include an introductory lecture with
class discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each
day will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These
sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring
exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as
well as applying these skills on your own to complete
complete individual exercises. After and during each
exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a
group. Computing will be done using a combination of
tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and
web resources accessed via web browser.
Who should attend
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers who are analyzing some kind of omic data (e.g.
WGS, exome, RNA-seq, variant les, etc.). Examples
demonstrated in this course will involve primarily human
genome/transcriptome data but many of the concepts
learned will be applicable to model organisms, metage-
nomics, simulated data, etc.
Requirements
Attendees should have a background in biology and
a basic knowledge of R. We will dedicate one session
to a brief R/linux primer. Attendees should have also
some familiarity with genomic data. The course will
teach relatively advanced usage of R (especially ggplot2
and Bioconductor packages). Attendees should have aworking installation of R and RStudio on their laptop.
Example data
Attendees will learn to visualize and interpret results
from real human genome data sets generated at the
McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University
School of Medicine. These data will be analyzed to de-
termine previously known as well as potentially novel in-
terpretations. Since the example data are not simulated
or arbitrarily ltered, interpretation and visualization
will be performed in the context of representative levels
of sequence error, and other sources of technical and
biological noise.

Berlin IntroAdvancedPython
Oct-Nov
Dear all,
We are pleased to inform you that we will run two
Python courses this year in Berlin:
1. Introduction to Python for biologists. 2-6 October
2017
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biol-
ogists: https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/-
t1/)
This course is aimed at all researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology who want to learn
programming. Students should have enough biological
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know about DNA and pro-
tein sequences, what translation is, and what introns
and exons are). No previous programming experience or
computer skills (beyond the ability to use a text editor)
are necessary, but you'll need to have a laptop with
Python installed.
Syllabus: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course11/curriculum-11/ For more in-
formation: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course2/ 1. Advanced Python for biologists.
13-17 November 2017
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biol-
ogists: https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/-
t1/)
The advanced course is aimed at people who want to
develop bigger or more complicated programs in Python,or to learn more about the language, or to explore dier-
ent approaches (object-oriented, functional) to program-
ming. The material covered is very general purpose and
can be applied to any kind of problem. Students should
have enough biological/bioinformatics background to
appreciate the examples and exercise problems (i.e. they
should know what a protein accession number, BLAST
report, and FASTA sequence is). They should also have
basic Python experience (the Introduction to Python
for Biologists course will full these requirements). Stu-
dents should be familiar with the use of lists, loops,
functions and conditions in Python and have written at
least a few small programs from scratch.

Berlin SingleCellRNAseq Feb5-8
Workshop: Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course18/ Dates: 5th-9th February 2018
Instructors:August 1, 2017 EvolDir 113
Dr. Vladimir Kiselev (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
UK)
Dr. Tallulah Andrews (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
UK)
COURSE OVERVIEW
In recent years single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has
become widely used for transcriptome analysis in many
areas of biology. In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-
seq provides quantitative measurements of the expres-
sion of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze
scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some
of the underlying assumptions for the methods devel-
oped for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid.
In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq
processing, starting from the raw reads coming o the
sequencer. The course includes common analysis strate-
gies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss
the central biological questions that can be addressed
using scRNA-seq.
WORKSHOP FORMAT
The workshop will be delivered over the course of ve
days. Each day will include an introductory lecture with
class discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each
day will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These
sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring
exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as
well as applying these skills on your own to complete
individual exercises. After and during each exercise,
interpretation of results will be discussed as a group.
Computing will be done using a combination of tools
installed on the attendees laptop computer and web
resources accessed via web browser.
WHO SHOULD ATTEND
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers who are analyzing scRNA-seq data. The mate-
rial is suitable both for experimentalists who want to
learn more about data-analysis as well as computational
biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods.
Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied
to any experimental protocol or biological system.
REQUIREMENTS
The course is intended for those who have basic famil-
iarity with Unix and bash and R scripting languages.
We will also assume that you are familiar with mapping
and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with the
commonly available computational tools.
EXAMPLE DATA
Attendees will learn to process, analyze, visualize and
interpret results from one of the Gene Expression Om-nibus (GEO) publicly available single cell datasets.
These datasets were generated from dierent organisms
and tissues. These data are representative of multiple
scRNASeq protocols and various experimental designs.
They will be analyzed to determine previously known
as well as potentially novel interpretations.

larly ape and phangorn). Other software will be used
(e.g., MUSCLE or Clustal) called from R. Overall, the
course will cover almost all aspects of phylogenetic infer-
ence from reading/downloading the data to plotting the
results. This course is intended for PhD and postgradu-
ate students, researchers and engineers in evolutionary
biology, systematics, population genetics, ecology, con-
servation.

*Understanding the genetic architecture of complex
traits through SNP-based heritability analysis*
Date: Tuesday 5th September, University College Lon-
don, 10-4pm
Tutors: Prof David Balding (Melbourne and UGI) and
Dr Doug Speed (UGI)
Cost: 40 (or 30 for UCL Members)
Advance Registration is REQUIRED
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ucl-genetics-short-
course-methods-for-analysing-complex-trait-gwas-data-
tickets-36314483598 *|- *
*Background: *In recent years there has been great
progress in developing genome-wide statistical analyses
for detecting causal variants, constructing prediction
models and better understanding the genetic architec-
ture of complex traits. However the underlying regres-
sion model involves very large numbers of predictors,
and strong modelling assumptions are required to tackle
the consequent problem of over-tting. The results can
be sensitive to these assumptions, and also to the ef-fects of population structure, genotyping errors and the
extent to which rare SNPs are included.
*Course outline: *We will cover mixed-model associa-
tion analysis (e.g., Fast-LMM, GEMMA), risk prediction
(e.g., polygenic risk scores, BLUP and MultiBLUP) and
heritability analyses (GCTA, LDAK, LDSC), both using
individual-level genetic data and summary statistics. We
will emphasise the common elements of these methods,
highlighting a standard framework that has emerged for
genome-wide SNP analysis, while also contrasting the
dierences in underlying modelling assumptions.
The practicals will provide step-by-step details for
analysing genetic data, starting either with indvidual-
level data (e.g., PLINK les or the output from IM-
PUTE2) or summary statistics (p-values from a GWAS).
There will be a selection of worked examples; to take
part in the practicals, participants should bring a laptop
with either MAC or LINUX OS
*Prerequisites:* Participants should be procient in
statistics including some familiarity with random-eects
regression models. In genetics, knowledge of SNP geno-
types and Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium will
be assumed. Computer scripts and output will be dis-
cussed that assume some familiarity with scientic com-
puting using linux. Some familiarity with PLINK would
be helpful but is not essential.

Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at complete beginners and as-
sumes no prior programming experience. It gives an
overview of the language with an emphasis on practical
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn
from various aspects of bioinformatics work. The work-
shop is structured so that the parts of the language most
useful for bioinformatics are introduced as early as possi-
ble, and that students can start writing plausibly-useful
programs after the rst few sessions. After completing
the workshop, students should be in a position to (1)
apply the skills they have learned to tackling problems
in their own research and (2) continue their Python
education in a self-directed way.
\Great learning from someone with a biology background
rather than computer science - meant we were on the
same wavelength." (February 2016) \Brilliantly well-
run. From the book; to the USB stick with all the les
we need; to the topics covered; to the system of helping
us one-on-one, I cannot fault this course." (February
2016)
INSTRUCTORS Dr. Martin Jones (Founder, Python
for Biologists) Dr. Bert Overduin (Training and Out-reach Bioinformatician, Edinburgh Genomics)
WORKSHOP FORMAT The workshop is delivered over
ten half-day sessions. Each session consists of roughly a
one hour lecture followed by two hours of practical exer-
cises, with breaks at the organiser's discretion. Each ses-
sion uses examples and exercises that build on material
from the previous one, so it's important that students
attend all sessions. A description of the sessions can be
found at the bottom of this page.
WHO SHOULD ATTEND This workshop is aimed at
researchers and technical workers with a background in
biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus
has been planned with complete beginners in mind; peo-
ple with previous programming experience are welcome
to attend as a refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow.
If in doubt, take a look at the detailed session content
below or drop Martin Jones or Bert Overduin an email.
REQUIREMENTS Students should have enough bi-
ological/bioinformatics background to appreciate the
examples and exercise problems (i.e. they should know
what a protein accession number, BLAST report, and
FASTA sequence is).
No previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary.
During the workshop students will use their own laptops.
Instructions for any software to be installed will be sent
out prior to the course.
SESSION CONTENT 1. Introduction In this session
I introduce the students to Python and explain what
we expect them to get out of it and how learning to
program can benet their research. I explain the format
of the course and take care of any housekeeping details
(like coee breaks and catering arrangements). I outline
the edit-run-x cycle of software development and talk
about how to avoid common text editing errors. In this
session, we also check that the computing infrastructure
for the rest of the course is in place (e.g. making sure
that everybody has an appropriate version of Python
installed). Core concepts introduced: source code, text
editors, whitespace, syntax and syntax errors, Python
versions 2. Manipulating text In this session students
learn to write very simple programs that produce output
to the terminal, and in doing so become comfortable
with editing and running Python code. This session
also introduces many of the technical terms that we'll
rely on in future sessions. I run through some examples
of tools for working with text and show how they work
in the context of biological sequence manipulation. We
also cover dierent types of errors and error messages,
and learn how to go about xing them methodically.
Core concepts introduced: terminals, standard output,
variables and naming, strings and characters, special122 EvolDir August 1, 2017
characters, output formatting, statements, functions,
methods, arguments, comments.
3. Working with les I introduce this session by talking
about the importance of les in bioinformatics pipelines
and workows, and we then explore the Python inter-
faces for reading from and writing to les. This involves

\Structural Equation Modelling for Ecologists and Evo-
lutionary Biologists"
Delivered by Dr. Jarret Byrnes and Dr. Jon Lefcheck
www.prstatistics.com/course/structural-equation-
modelling-for-ecologists-and-evolutionary-biologists-
semr01/ This course will run from 23rd - 27th October
2017 at Margam Park Discovery Centre, Wales, UK
Course only and all inclusive packages are available.
The course is a primer on structural equation modelling
(SEM) and conrmatory path analysis, with an em-
phasis on practical skills and applications to real-world
data.
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is a rapidly grow-
ing technique in ecology and evolution that unites multi-
ple hypotheses in a single causal network. It provides an
intuitive graphical representation of relationships among
variables, underpinned by well-described mathematical
estimation procedures. Several advances in SEM over
the past few years have expanded its utility for typical
ecological datasets, which include count data, missing
observations, and nested or hierarchical designs. We
will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide
approachable mathematical explanations of the tech-
niques, and cover recent extensions to mixed eects
models and non-normal distributions. Along the way,
we will work through many examples from the primary
literature using the open- source statistical software
R (www.r-project.org). We will draw on two popular
R packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan and
piecewiseSEM. Participants are encouraged to bringtheir own data, as there will be opportunities through-
out the course to plan, analyse, and receive feedback on
structural equation models.
Course content is as follows

tural Equation Modeling? Why would I use it? Module
2: Creating multivariate causal models Module 3: Fit-
ting piecewise models Readings: Grace 2010 (overview),

Vienna ExperimentalEvolution
Nov6-10 2
Dear colleagues,
a reminder about the upcoming Experimental Evolution
course in Vienna, Austria:
The Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics is
now accepting applications for the course \Experimental
evolution: From theory to practice" at the University of
Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, November 6-10, 2017.
Experimental evolution is extensively used to address
questions of evolutionary biology by exposing evolv-
ing populations to dierent environmental conditions.
It oers the opportunity to replicate experiments and
test for convergent outcomes. With the recent drop in
DNA sequencing cost and the advance of sequencing
technologies, the combination of experimental evolution
with next generation sequencing of pools of individuals
(Evolve & Resequence) has become a state-of-the-art
method to link phenotypic responses to genetic changes.
Although the availability of replicated time series data
is one key advantage of E&R, the analysis of such data
sets is still in its infancy. This course will introduce the
participants to several new approaches for the analysis
of genomic time series data covering the latest software
tools as well as required statistical and computational
skills.The course is targeted towards researchers interested
in experimental evolution combined with NGS and will
cover the design of experimental evolution studies as
well as the analysis of Pool-Seq time series data.
The course aims to introduce participants to:
State-of-the-art software packages Modeling of neutral
data Identifying selected regions Comparison of n-point
analysis with time series data Inferring linkage structure
of Pool-Seq data Estimating selection coecients Call-
ing transposable elements in time series data Inferring
selection in transcriptomics data
Morning lectures by internationally renowned faculty
will be followed by computer practicals on the analysis
of experimental evolution data in the afternoon.
Faculty:
Jerey E. Barrick (The University of Texas at Austin,
US) Anthony M. Dean (University of Minnesota, US)
Tadeusz J. Kawecki (University of Lausanne, CH)
Christian Schl otterer (Vetmeduni Vienna, A) Marina
Telonis-Scott (Monash University, AUS) Olivier Tenail-
lon (French Institute for Medical Research, FR) Hen-
rique Teotonio (IBENS, FR)
The course is free but will be restricted to a maximum
of 15 participants for the practical sessions (hands on
computer lab). Additional seats will be available for
attending the lectures, only. Students and researchers
are invited to apply by submitting a single .pdf le con-
taining 1) a short CV, 2) a motivation letter and a state-
ment of computer skills to popgen.vienna@gmail.com
by August 15, 2017. Condence in working with Unix
command line as well as in R, is strongly recommended
for the practicals. Participants are expected to arrange
their own accommodation.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
