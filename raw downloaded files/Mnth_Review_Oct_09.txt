IU/UO November 2009 Symposium
Current Frontiers in the Integration of Evolution, De-
velopment, and Genomics
November 13-15, 2009
The Evolution, Development and Genomics NSF
IGERT trainees of Indiana University and the Univer-
sity of Oregon cordially invite you to our annual gradu-
ate student organized symposium, titled Current Fron-
tiers in the Integration of Evolution, Development, and
Genomics. Past symposia have focused on speciﬁc areas
of inquiry within this maturing, integrative ﬁeld: gene
duplication, evolution of gene regulation, evolution of
gene networks, the origin of novel features, and bridging
macro- and micro-evolutionary concepts. The upcom-
ing symposium will focus on what has been gleaned
from this integrative approach to biological research.
Speciﬁcally, a broad array of notable invited scientists
will speak in sessions focusing on the integration of Evo-
lution with Development, Development with Genomics,
or Evolution with Genomics.
We anticipate our attendance will facilitate stimulating
interactions with top researchers, as has been the case
in our past IGERT symposia. We thoroughly encourage
attendees to present their work at the Saturday evening
poster session.
This symposium will be held November 13th to 15th(Friday evening through Sunday morning) at the
Bloomington campus of Indiana University. PZ My-
ers will open our symposium with a keynote lecture,
followed by an opening reception on Friday. The sym-
posium continues on Saturday with a full day of in-
vited talks focusing on “Evolution and Development”
and “Development and Genomics,” followed by a poster
session and banquet in the evening. We conclude on the
15th with a ﬁnal morning session on “Evolution and
Genomics” and closing remarks.
Registration is $75 for graduate students and $150 for
faculty and post-docs. After October 15, 2009, a $25
late fee will be added to the registration fee.
For further registration, accommodation, and speaker
schedule information, please refer to the IU/UO IGERT

Dear all,
We are please to announce that the 5th Portuguese
Evolutionary Biology Meeting will take place at In-
stituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA) in Lis-
bon on December 21st 2009. It is being organized by
Unidade de Investiga¸ c˜ ao em Eco-etologia and Centro
de Biociˆ encias do ISPA (Rua Jardim do Tabaco, 34,
Lisbon).
The Portuguese Evolutionary Biology Meetings aim to
bring together Portuguese researchers and to promote
Evolutionary Biology in Portugal. They are held in late
December to allow researchers in foreign institutions to
attend, given that many spend their Winter break in
Portugal.
To celebrate this special year, we will have Prof. Dou-
glas Futuyma (Stony Brook University, NY, USA) as
an invited speaker. The remainder presenters will be
either Portuguese or working in Portugal.
Presenters should register by sending a message to bi-
ologia.evolutiva@gmail.com with the following informa-
tion:
- Presentation title, - Name and aﬃliation, - Topic
The deadline for registration is November 27th. Por-
tuguese and English will be the oﬃcial languages of the
meeting.
Also, we are happy to announce that we will discuss thecreation of the Portuguese Evolutionary Biology Asso-
ciation. This idea has been on table for some time now
and we will decide if this is the time to formalize it.
We would appreciate ample distribution of this an-
nouncement.
Best regards,
The Organizing Committee

Community genetics integrates the ﬁelds of ecology and
evolution by considering the eﬀects of intra-speciﬁc ge-
netic variation on the wider community. The general
idea is that species do not live in a stable, abiotic envi-
ronment. Instead, they interact directly and indirectly
with associated species in combination with the abiotic
environment, causing eﬀects that can be distinguished
at a community level.

NHM London YoungSystematists
Dec2
Dear EvolDir,
This is a call for participants in the 2009 Young System-
atics’ Forum meeting held in the Natural History Mu-
seum, London, on Wednesday 2nd December. Please
see details below.
11TH YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS’ FORUM
WEDNESDAY, 2nd December 2009, 9 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre, Natural History Mu-
seum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists’ Forum represents an
exciting setting for postgraduate students and young
postdoctoral researchers to present their data, often
for the ﬁrst time, to a scientiﬁc audience interested in
taxonomy, systematics and phylogenetics. This well-
established event provides an important opportunity
for budding systematists to discuss their research infront of their peers within a supportive environment.
Supervisors and other established systematists are also
encouraged to attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE. Send applications by e-mail to
David Bass (d.bass@nhm.ac.uk), supplying your name,
contact address and stating whether you wish to give an
oral or poster presentation. Space will be allocated sub-
ject to availability and to make a balanced programme
of animal, plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other
research. Non- presenting attendees should also register
as above.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than 18th November 2009. The body text should
not exceed 150 words in length. If the presentation
is co-authored, the actual speaker (oral) or presenter
(poster) must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
All registered attendants will receive by e-mail fur-
ther information about the meeting, including ab-
stracts, one week in advance. This information will
also be displayed on the Systematics Association web-
site ( www.systass.org ).

TITLE OF MESSAGE: “Molecular Anthropology on
the Genomic Era” - International conference in Rome
(Italy), December 3-5, 2009
Dear Evoldir Members,
a conference called “Molecular Anthropology on the
Genomic Era” addressing anthropologists, population
geneticists and scholars belonging to related discplines
will be held next December (3-5) in Rome (Italy).
Among others, invited speakers are: Mark JOBLING
(UK); Jorge ROCHA Portugal; Connie MULLIGAN
(USA); Martin RICHARDS (UK); John NOVEMBRE
(USA)...October 1, 2009 EvolDir 11
A CALL for abstracts is now open at the fol-
lowing (very simple) website: http://www.mnhn.fr/-
mnhn/ecoanthropologie/Rome2009/Rome index.html
The structure of the conference is to present state-of-
art research continent by continent since, as a matter
of fact, the research of many colleagues is geographi-
cally focused. Our objective is to contribute examples
and ideas that will drive further integration of molec-
ular anthropology and other research ﬁelds and disci-
plines. Particular attention will be given to the impact
of new analytical methods but also, and more tradi-
tionally, to updated and comprehensive syntheses about
human diversity, since browsing the ever growing liter-
ature requires an enormous time that acts as a barrier
among specialists of diﬀerent areas. The last day will
be devoted to human evolutionary research in an in-
terdisciplinary frame. Theories and approaches will be
discussed in a challenging way by putting face-to-face
molecular anthropologists and experts from other disci-
plines. We are putting much energy in organizing such
latter session since we would like to emphasize the dan-
gers of the hyper specialization mentioned above.

1st Call <<New and Emerging Fungal Diseases of An-
imals and Plants : evolutionary aspects in the context
of global changes >>
The CNRS and Conferences Jaques Monod are hosting
a 4-day meeting at the French Marine Biology research
station in Roscoﬀ, Brittany on the evolution and dy-
namics of emerging fungal pathogens. This meeting willfocus on the widening impacts that fungi are having on
human, plant and animal health by considering the fac-
tors that drive their emergence within an evolutionary
context. Speciﬁcally, the meeting will consider whether
environmental change is facilitating fungal range ex-
pansions and genotypes, and to what extent this is
predictable. The meeting will bring together leading
evolutionary biologists, theoreticians and fungal biolo-
gists/ecologists in a beautiful setting to consider these
questions and to formulate new research strategies.

Barcelona EvolutionaryGenomics
PHD IN EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS
Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain
A PhD position (4 years) is available in the group of
Evolutionary Genomics coordinated by M.Mar Alb` a at
Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain) in the
framework of the National Research Plan 2009-2012.
The group is located in the recently built Barcelona
Biomedical Research Park, an international Institute
with over1,000 researchers working on diﬀerent aspects
of molecular biology and biomedicine.
Application deadline: November 30 2009 Starting data:
September 1 2010
The project will investigate the mechanisms of emer-
gence of novel genes in mammalian genomes using,
primarily, computational genomics. The formation of
novel genes in genomes is strongly linked to the emer-
gence of new functions. A fraction of these novel genes
is formed by gene duplication, but another fraction orig-
inates by alternative mechanisms. This last fraction
comprises the so called orphan genes, which are genes
for which no homologues can be found in other species.
The number of orphan genes in any genomes is intrigu-
ingly high and many of these genes have an unknown
origin. We have recently shown that a large portion
of the primate orphan genes contain sequences derived
from primate-speciﬁc transposable elements, suggest-
ing that these elements play an important role in theemergence of new genes and molecular functions. In
addition, we have found evidence that a number of the
orphan genes are likely to have originated de novo from
pre-existing non-coding genomic sequences (Toll-Riera
et al., 2009, Mol. Biol. Evol. 26:603-612). The project
will identify novel genes formed at diﬀerent time peri-
ods during the evolution of mammals, investigate how
they have originated, and assess the role of adaptive
evolution in their retention.
The candidate should have a strong academic record
and hold an MSc at the PhD starting time. An in-
terest in sequence analysis and evolution is required.
Programming skills will be a beneﬁt.
To know more about our group please visit our web
page: evolutionarygenomics.imim.es
To apply send an informal email to Mar Alb` a
(malba@imim.es), including your CV, a short state-
ment of your research interests, and the names of two
references.

A PhD fellowship is available to work with Dr. John
McKay at Colorado State University. We are looking
for a highly motivated individual with a solid training
in Evolution, Plant Physiology and Genomics and with
the demonstrated ability to carry out outstanding re-
search. The applied goal of the project is to improve the
drought stress tolerance of winter wheat by incorporat-
ing germplasm primarily from the wild relative Aegilops
tauschii. The fundamental goal of the project is to iden-
tify and physiologically characterize genes and genomic
regions underlying variation in yield and its sensitivity
to drought by combining plant breeding with genome-
wide molecular techniques and whole-plant physiology.
The position is available January 2009, but the start is
ﬂexible. The successful applicant will participate in a
short-course in breeding for drought adaptation, which
will take place in June 2010. Salary and beneﬁts are
competitive, and CSU is an excellent academic envi-
ronment for the study of plant biology. Our lab group
has excellent interactions with colleagues in bioinfor-
matics, plant physiology, ecology, evolutionary genetics
and molecular biology. Fort Collins is located on the
Front Range of the Rockies and is ranked highly among
great places to live. This position is restricted to US

HostParasiteCoevolution
PhD on host-parasite coevolution, Kiel, Germany
Summary: The PhD project aims at a comprehensive
experimental test of the consequences of host-parasite
co-evolution. It is based on a selection experiment un-
der controlled laboratory conditions followed by exten-
sive phenotypic and molecular analysis. The approach
relies on a unique model system, consisting of the ne-
matode Caenorhabditis elegans as a host and its micro-
parasite Bacillus thuringiensis, which are both ideally
suited to experimental analysis. The results of this
project are expected to have an impact on four bio-
logical research themes that are of particular current
interest: the animal innate immune system, bacterial
virulence, life-history trade-oﬀs, and the generation of
biological diversity.
Supervision and location: The project is supervised by18 EvolDir October 1, 2009
Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schulenburg and funded by the Ger-
man Science Foundation (position according to 13 TV-
L/2). It is based in the recently founded Department
of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics at the Univer-
sity of Kiel, Northern Germany. The project is part
of the German priority programme SPP 1399 on host-
parasite coevolution and thus includes comprehensive
interactions with various research groups across Ger-
many and abroad. The department itself provides an
international and interactive atmosphere, while Kiel
University and connected institutes (e.g., Max Planck
Institute in Ploen) oﬀer a stimulating research envi-
ronment with a particular focus on evolutionary biol-
ogy and also C. elegans genetics. The city of Kiel is
a medium-sized pleasant town located at the coast of
the Baltic Sea. It is the capital of the most Northern
state of Germany, Schleswig-Holstein. It oﬀers many
opportunities for leisure activities, including theatres,
an opera, the Schleswig-Holstein classical music festi-
val, the heavy metal festival in Wacken, sailing, surf-
ing, cycling, and the famous festivities of the “Kieler
Woche” V one of the largest sailing events in Europe.
Requirements for the position: Master or Diploma in
Biology, high motivation, excellent background in evo-
lutionary biology (especially host-parasite evolution)
and statistics, handling of complex experimental set-
up, teamwork, ideally some experience with C. elegans
or bacteria, ﬂuency in English.
Applications: Please send applications with CV, one-
page statement of research interests, and two refer-
ences, as a pdf-ﬁle by email to Hinrich Schulenburg
(hschulenburg <at>zoologie.uni-kiel.de). Deadline for
applications: 7th October 2009. Start of position: De-
cember 2009 or soon afterwards.

PhD Studentships in Evolutionary Genetics and Inte-
grative Developmental Biology, Michigan State Univer-
sity, USA.
Four graduate positions in evolutionary genet-
ics/developmental biology are available in the labora-
tories of Dr. Alex Shingleton and Dr. Ian Dworkin in
the Department of Zoology and Program in Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology and Behavior at Michigan State
University. The positions are funded as part of three
NSF grants working at the interface of evolution, devel-
opment and genetics. The Shingleton and Dworkin lab-
oratories work closely together and employ molecular,
genetic, genomic, physiological and behavioral methods
to address their research questions, using Drosophila
as a model organism. More details on the research
being conducted in the laboratories are available at
www.msu.ed/ ˜ shingle9 and www.msu.edu/ ~idworkin.
Students will be immersed in an integrative and col-
laborative research experience within the diverse and
dynamic life-science community at Michigan State Uni-
versity.
Potential projects for graduate students include:
1) Elucidating the molecular and developmental regu-
lation of morphological scaling relationships. Previous
research in the Shingleton lab has identiﬁed the insulin-
signaling pathway as being diﬀerently regulated in or-
gans that diﬀer in their scaling relationship with body20 EvolDir October 1, 2009
size. The goal of the project is to elucidate the molec-
ular basis for this diﬀerential regulation.
2) Exploring the evolution of wing-body scaling in
Drosophila populations. This project involves applying
artiﬁcial selection on scaling relationships in Drosophila
and elucidating the genetic and developmental basis for
the selection response.
3) Examining the role of conditional and pleiotropic ge-
netic eﬀects in the evolutionary process, and mapping
genetic modiﬁers that contribute to these eﬀects. Pre-
vious work (Dworkin et al. 2009) demonstrated that a
genetic modiﬁer of the allelic eﬀects of a mutant results
in profound diﬀerence in phenotypes. The student will
ﬁne map the genetic modiﬁer and examine its potential
pleiotropic contributions in natural populations.
4) Explore the eﬀects of diﬀerent genetic backgrounds
on gene interactions and ordering of allelic series for mu-
tations that aﬀect wing development and shape. This
work will examine the eﬀects of a series of mutations in
diﬀerent “wild-type” genetic backgrounds, across sev-
eral rearing environments (manipulations of diet and
temperature).
The projects will suit students with an interest in evo-
lutionary genetics and/or integrative developmental bi-
ology. The ideal candidate should have good general
laboratory skills, with a ﬁrm grasp of basic statistical
methods.
Michigan State University is a large land-grant institu-
tion with an outstanding faculty and inter-disciplinary
programs at the departmental and university levels. In-
terested applicants are encouraged to review additional
background on faculty and graduate programs in Zool-
ogy ( http://www.zoology.msu.edu ), and in the Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology and Behavior (EEBB) program
(https://www.msu.edu/˜eebb ).
Applicants should submit a statement of interest, a
CV, GRE scores and their cumulative GPA along with
names and contact information of three references (ev-
erything as one PDF document) to shingle9@msu.edu.
Applications will be accepted until the positions are
ﬁlled. The start date is September 2010, although ap-
plicants who wish to start sooner should also apply.

Portugal Modelling
PhD position in seagrass lagoon-scape genetics
A PhD position is oﬀered to work in the project
ˆ aLandscape genetics of a coastal lagoon: an empiri-
cal and modeling approach using the seagrass /Zostera
noltii/ in Ria Formosaˆ a ﬁnanced by FCT (Portuguese
Science Financing Agency). The successful candi-
date should hold a European or equivalent Master de-
gree in biology/botany/oceanography/molecular biol-October 1, 2009 EvolDir 21
ogy/mathematics or related ﬁeld. Prior practical expe-
rience in ecological modeling and geographic informa-
tion systems analysis is preferred, knowledge of pop-
ulation genetics theory and experience with molecular
biology techniques (PCR, DNA extraction) is appreci-
ated. The candidate should be motivated for computer
analysis and modeling approaches, good team player,
and proﬁcient in English (written and oral).
The project focuses on applying innovative landscape
genetics analysis to an important lagoon in Southern
Portugal the Ria Formosa. The model species is the
seagrass /Zostera noltii/ which covers 45% of the inter-
tidal area of the lagoon, also there is the chance to work
with /Syngnathus abaster/ a pipeﬁsh highly dependent
on seagrass habitat.
The project wishes to answer to the following objec-
tives: (a) detect landscape barriers to gene ﬂow, cre-
ated by either the structural dimension of the landscape
or by the hydrodynamic properties in the channel sys-
tem; (b) analyze the spatial autocorrelation of seagrass
allocation strategies (sexual versus asexual population
growth) and their relationships to patch size, fragmen-
tation and isolation, as well as their proximity to dis-
turbance sources (sedimentation associated with inlet
delta); and (c) understand putative source-sink popu-
lation dynamics, and its relation to habitat quality, that
can be useful for identifying and guiding Natural Park
management decisions about protection status of dif-
ferent areas. By fulﬁlling these goals it will be possible
to produce spatial predictions of the metapopulation
resilience.
The PhD subject will deal mostly with hydrodynamic
modeling of dispersal inside the lagoon, working with
an available hydrodynamic model, and integrating the
results from modeling dispersal pathways, landscape at-
tributes quantiﬁed within this project, and genetic dif-
ferentiation, all under a Geographic Information Sys-
tems (GIS) framework.
The student will also learn the microsatellite analysis
technique used to genotype the extensive collections of
samples in this project, but is primarily expected to
have some prior knowledge of GIS and to have a solid
mathematical background.
Most of the work will be conducted at the Centre of
Marine Sciences at University of Algarve, in Faro, Por-
tugal, within the Marine Ecology and Evolution group
(http://www.ccmar.ualg.pt/maree ). The hydrological
modeling tasks of this project will run at Porto in CE-
MAS (centre for modeling and analysis of environmen-
tal systems) at University Fernando Pessoa under the
supervision of Prof. Pedro Duarte, and is expected that
the applicant visits Porto for periods up to six months.A research assistant grant at the master level

AvianBehavioralEvolution
The University of Antwerp is a knowledge centre with
3.600 co-workers that performs ground-breaking and in-
novative research of international standing. The uni-
versity takes special care to ensure optimum support
and supervision of students, and pays constant atten-
tion to educational innovation. The university is an
autonomous pluralistic institution that is committed
to the enhancement of an open, democratic and multi-
cultural society, and it pursues an equal opportunities
policy.
The university is seeking to ﬁll the following vacancy
(m/f) at the Department Biology-Ethology of the Fac-
ulty of Sciences:
Ph.D. student in the ﬁeld of Avian Behavioral Ecology
Job description: The Ph.D. student will join a group
of researchers working on all four major aspects of an-
imal behaviour: causation, development, function and
evolution. Recent work of the Ethology group (Head:
Prof. Dr. Marcel Eens) is focusing on (1) the function
and evolution of bird song with particular attention to
costs and constraints that limit the expression of song;
(2) the relationships between hormones, behaviour and
life histories, including (hormone-mediated) maternal
eﬀects The project aims to study the functional and
evolutionary consequences of hormone-mediated mater-
nal eﬀects in birds. Maternal eﬀects are thought to haveevolved to signal environmental conditions to the oﬀ-
spring (“weather-forecasting”), preparing the oﬀspring
for the post-hatching environment. The proximate ef-
fects of maternally derived hormones on oﬀspring de-
velopment have already been studied in great detail,
but most of the studies have focused on branding the
eﬀects as positive or negative to the oﬀspring. However,
this view ignores that changes in oﬀspring development
may also provide costs to parents, e.g. via changes in
the food demand. Furthermore, (hormone-mediated)
maternal eﬀects have the potential to generate crucial
evolutionary trade-oﬀs: “what’s best for the parents
may not be best for an individual oﬀspring”. Maternal
yolk hormones may therefore not only serve as benign
“weather-forecasters”, signalling environmental condi-
tions, but enable female birds to manipulate oﬀspring
in their interest. We therefore want to know how the
eﬀects of maternally derived steroid hormones on oﬀ-
spring development impinge on maternal/parental ﬁt-
ness, and whether maternal yolk hormones serve the
evolutionary interests of oﬀspring or mother/father.
Proﬁle and requirements: * You hold a MSc degree in
Biology or related ﬁelds * You have experience with ani-
mal research * You are interested in behavioural ecology
and/or endocrinology
We oﬀer: * An initial 1-year contract, extendable up to

UBasel SexualSelection
PhD position on ’Sex allocation, sexual selection and
sexual conﬂict in simultaneous hermaphrodites’ (earli-
est starting date is December 2009), Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Switzer-
land ( http://evolution.unibas.ch ).
A full-time 3-year PhD position is available in the group
of Dr. Lukas Scharer ( http://evolution.unibas.ch/-
scharer/ ). The research in my group focuses on the
evolutionary ecology of reproduction in simultaneous
hermaphrodites, using a highly suitable model, the free-
living marine ﬂatworm Macrostomum lignano. Our re-
search integrates a diversity of approaches, including
controlled laboratory experiments, ﬁeld work, molec-
ular developmental biology, experimental evolution,
quantitative genetics, genomics, molecular phylogenet-
ics and comparative methods.
The aims of the advertised PhD position are to bet-
ter understand mechanisms of post-copulatory sexual
selection (i.e. sperm competition and cryptic female
choice) and resulting sexual conﬂicts in simultaneous
hermaphrodites. Moreover, current evolutionary the-
ory predicts that sexual selection can profoundly in-
ﬂuence the evolution of sex allocation (i.e. how much
a hermaphrodite invests in male and female reproduc-
tion), and mating partners may experience sexual con-
ﬂicts over the optimal sex allocation of the partner.
Only limited empirical data is currently available to test
these ideas. To produce such data the successful candi-
date will carry out laboratory experiments, molecular
paternity analyses, and ﬁeld work at the Mediterranean
Sea.
The Scharer group belongs to the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel,
a very stimulating and highly international research
environment with English as the predominant lan-
guage. The other groups focus on host-parasite inter-
actions (Ebert), speciation in ﬁshes (Salzburger), evo-
lution of the immune system (Du Pasquier), behavioral
ecology of birds (Amrhein), parent-oﬀspring conﬂicts
(K¨ olliker), and the evolutionary impact of transposable
elements (Walser) (see http://evolution.unibas.ch/-
research.htm ). Our Institute has very strong back-
grounds in experimental design, statistics, population
genetics, quantitative genetics, genomics and molecu-
lar biology. It is an ideal place for a PhD candidateinterested in evolutionary biology.
The successful candidate should be independent, ded-
icated, inquisitive, creative, and collaborative. More-
over, he/she should have a keen interest in evolution-
ary biology and be willing to learn about experimental
design and proper statistical analysis. Previous expe-
rience in molecular biology is an advantage, but not a
prerequisite. A MSc or equivalent education level is re-
quired for this position and the very handsome salary
is in accordance to the standards of the Swiss National
Science Foundation.
Basel is the third largest city of Switzerland and attrac-
tively situated at the foot of the Jura mountain range.
It has the beautiful river Rhine, and directly borders
both Germany and France, thus oﬀering rich culinary,
cultural, and outdoor possibilities.
To apply please send a letter of motivation, a CV, a
copy of your MSc-thesis (if available), and contact de-
tails of 2 referees to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch (electronic
applications in a single ﬁle are preferred). Reviewing of

UGroningen AvianEvolutionaryBiol
TheResearch Group Animal Ecology, Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Studies(CEES), Faculty of
Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University ofGroningen,has a ˆAvacancy for a full-time PhDposition:
ˆA PhD position:ﬁtness under competition ˆA
Thisis a PhD position for a person who loves to do in-
tensive ﬁeldwork on birds ina clear theoretical context.
The project aims to understand the role of ecological-
factors in determining the survival cost of parents of
raising a family. Althoughthis survival cost is central
to life history theory, paradoxically, it hasbeen diﬃcult
to demonstrate it in the ﬁeld. One aspect that has been
largelyoverlooked is that this cost not only depends on
individual work load, but alsoon the competitive envi-
ronment an individual is living in. The basic idea for-
this project is that if individuals have to work harder
to raise a brood, they losecompetitive ability by which
they may have reduced survival in highlycompetitive
environments. ˆA
Background: This PhD project ispart of a large re-
search program on ˆAﬁtness consequences of ˆAindividual
trait variation in the great tit in The Netherlands. In
our16-year population study in a spatially fragmented
population of great tits thefocus has been on density
dependence and quantifying selection pressures onre-
productive traits. Using an experimental approach we
studied how oﬀspring dispersaland ﬁtness was related
to brood size, brood sex ratio and to local sex ratioand
density in the fragments.
This project: takes up the challenge toquantify how
ecological settings interact with the cost of reproduc-
tion and addressesthe question: ˆ aIs parental competi-
tiveability aﬀected by reproductive rate?ˆ aWe learned
that the socialenvironment did aﬀect both oﬀspring
and parental ﬁtness. An intriguingresult was that the
cost of reproduction was aﬀected by the social envi-
ronment, withparents raising experimentally enlarged
broods showing higher mortality in morecompetitive
situations. This important eﬀect could be the motor be-
hindselection for reduced reproductive rates under high
competition (densitydependent reproduction), which
may have large repercussions for future ﬁtness.The dif-
ferential mortality took place in the second half of the
winter leadingto the hypothesis that raising large fam-
ilies did not have direct survivaleﬀects but aﬀected the
competitive ability of the parents leading to lowersur-
vival later at times of higher competition.
To test this idea we will 1) manipulate the local so-
cial environment in termsof competition in our sub-
populations and measure how ﬁtness costs andbeneﬁts
of reproductive rate are aﬀected, 2) quantify resources,
their use bythe tits, sex speciﬁc dispersal and survival
of both oﬀspring and parents inrelation to the local
social environment and the reproductive rate in the-
ﬁeld. 3) test the competitive ability of the parents inOctober 1, 2009 EvolDir 27
a semi-lab situation,and, 4) manipulate important re-
sources for the birds (nest boxes) in the secondhalf of
the non-breeding season to study if and how competi-
tive ability ofparents raising large families are aﬀected.
With this approach we will study anew mechanism that
may lead to adaptive density dependent reproductive
rates,as well as the costs of reproduction more in gen-
eral.

ogy research group which is part of the research in-
stituteCenter for Ecological and Evolutionary Stud-
ies (CEES) of Groningen University,The Netherlands.

The research groups Animal Ecology and Microbial
Ecology of the Centre for Ecological and Evolution-
ary Studies (University of Groningen, the Netherlands)
have a vacancy for a PhD-position:
Project “How microbes shape bird eggs: matching
pathogen risk and protection”
Microbes are everywhere. On birds, in birds, and
around birds. Birds and eggs need to protect them-
selves from pathogenic inﬂuences, but may also beneﬁt
from the microbial communities that they house. This
project explores how environmental conditions shape
variation in microbial communities and thereby have
evolutionary consequences for the protective systems of
birds against microbes. We use the egg-nest unit as a
simple model system to study the association between
microbial communities (of the nest environment) and
antimicrobial defenses (of the eggs). Inside an egg, in-
vading microbes encounter a nutrient-rich environment.
To protect the developing embryo from infection and
death the egg employs antimicrobial defenses. When
compared with the complex immune system of birds,
the antimicrobial defense of eggs is simple. It consists
of physical barriers (shell and membrane) and a chemi-
cal defense composed of several antimicrobial proteins.
The project consists of two parts: 1. experimentally
manipulating the nest microbial community and look-
ing at eﬀects on the antimicrobial defenses of eggs in
captive birds, and 2. performing a comparative study
on eggs of wild birds across a range of environmental
conditions. Molecular tools from microbial ecology as
well as immunological assays will need to be further
developed and ﬁne-tuned for this bird-project. This
project ﬁts in a larger research program focused on un-
derstanding how environmental pathogen pressure and
avian immune defenses interact and vary across space
and time.
REQUIREMENTS We are looking for an enthusiastic
and broad-minded candidate interested in integrating
microbial and animal ecology. Ideally, you are a mi-
crobial ecologist with a passion for birds, or an animal
ecologist with a special interest in microbes. A back-
ground in veterinary or animal science is also possible.
You have experience with microbiological and biochem-
ical laboratory work. Aﬃnity with work on birds, in
captivity and in the ﬁeld, will be an advantage.

Ph.D. POSITION IN SALMONID ECOLOGICAL GE-
NOMICS AND EVOLUTION
I am currently looking for an outstanding Ph.D. can-
didate with solid laboratory and bioinformatics skills,
to be involved in our long-term research program on
the ecological genomics of sympatric forms of whiteﬁsh
(Coregonus spp.) engaged in the early stages of speci-
ation process. This multidisciplinary project is funded
by NSERC (Canada) and part of the research programof the Canadian Research in Genomics and Conserva-
tion of Aquatic Resources.
The combined use of gene mapping, population ge-
nomics and transcriptomics recently allowed the iden-
tiﬁcation of over 500 genes representing a vast array
of physiological functions that are candidates for the
adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation of these
sympatric forms. By means of the latest technologi-
cal developments (e.g. next-generation sequencing and
high-throughput genotyping), the selected candidate
could address some of the following questions that we
are particularly interested in: What are the size, dis-
tribution and nature of genomic islands of divergence
that are being maintained in the face of ongoing gene
ﬂow? Can natural selection be strong enough to main-
tain species cohesiveness by favouring the spread of al-
leles that are advantageous within a same form (lim-
netic or benthic)? Are adaptations to similar ecological
niches that evolved independently due to the same mu-
tations? Do alleles conferring their speciﬁcity to lim-
netic and benthic whiteﬁsh emerge from standing ge-
netic variation or new mutations? What are the rela-
tive contributions of regulatory and structural changes
to the speciation process of whiteﬁsh?
I am primarily looking for a candidate that would
present the proﬁle for quickly applying for a Vanier
Canada Graduate Scholarships (Vanier CGS) http:/-
/www.vanier.gc.ca/hp-pa-eng.shtml . This very highly
competitive scholarship program is designed to attract

ing their studies at Canadian universities. Vanier Schol-
ars are expected to demonstrate leadership skills and
exceptional standard of scholarly achievement in nat-
ural sciences and engineering. Canadian and interna-
tional students are eligible to be nominated for a Vanier
Scholarship, which is valued at $50,000 per year for up
to three years.
As the ﬁrst step of the selection process must be

Hello,
Our group at Laval University in Qu´ ebec City would
like to post an oﬀer for a graduate student scholarship
in Forestry (Population genetics of wood properties in
white spruce).
Graduate assistantship (M. Sc.) Population genetics
of wood properties in white spruce. Center for For-
est Research and Institute for Integrative and Systems
Biology (IBIS) Laval University (Quebec, Canada) A
graduate assistantship is available for a Master’s de-
gree in forest sciences at Laval University to investi-
gate the genetic variability of wood properties among
populations of white spruce trees (Picea glauca). The
project is a partnership between the Canadian Wood
Fibre Center (CWFC) (Dr J. Beaulieu), Laval Univer-
sity (Dr J. MacKay) and the Ministry of Natural Re-
sources and Fauna of Quebec. The impact of genetics
on the variability of wood properties will be investi-
gated by comparing populations from several distinct
eco-regions. The speciﬁc goals are as follows:
* Quantify the variability of wood ﬁbre traits among
white spruce populations from diﬀerent ecoregions in
Quebec;
* Investigate correlations between wood ﬁbre traits and
growth conditions such as the site index and stand
structure in order to develop predictive models for wood
quality;
* Verify the degree of relatedness between sampled trees
by using DNA markers in order to: i) assess the poten-
tial impact of genetic relatedness on correlations be-
tween traits and growth conditions or ii) use it as a
variable in the models.
Laboratory work mainly includes DNA extractions
and genotyping of several markers to estimate the
degree of relatedness between trees from diﬀerent
ecoregions. Statistical analysis of wood and ﬁbre
property data will assess if signiﬁcant variation can
be attributed to the origin of the trees (ecoregions)
and to develop mathematical models to predict wood
properties. The results will ﬁnd application in appliedtree breeding programs. A stipend of 16000 $ (CAN)
per year is available for a two year period starting
as early as January 2010. Laval University is a
French language institution which welcomes many
international students, and oﬀers high quality graduate
training and access to modern and well-equipped
laboratories in the areas of forest genetics and ge-
nomics within the Institute for Integrative and Systems
Biology (IBIS). Contact Dr John Mackay, by email

UOklahoma DaphniaEvolution
Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA)/Ph.D. stu-
dent position available: A Ph.D. student position is
available in my laboratory to work on a new 3-year
NSF-funded project entitled, -environment interactions
V impact of cultural eutrophication on Daphnia tracked
by genomics, physiology, and resurrection ecology.
In a planned 36-month project in collaboration with
colleagues at Oklahoma State University and Indiana
University, the PIs will use an integrated approach
involving genetic/genomic, physiological, and ecology
methods to examine how cultural eutrophication (i.e.,
enrichment of freshwater systems with nutrients such
as phosphorus) inﬂuences evolutionary changes in or-
ganisms. The waterﬂea, Daphnia pulex, which plays
a major role in freshwater food webs (i.e. it eats al-
gae/bacteria and in turn is fed upon by ﬁsh), will serve
as the model organism. Daphnia are ideal for such
studies because they produce resting eggs that can lay
dormant in lake sediments for long periods of time.
Decades-old eggs can be induced to hatch (i.e. ecology)
and viable DNA can be extracted from eggs that are32 EvolDir October 1, 2009
centuries old. Moreover, the D. pulex genome has been
sequenced and genetic/genomic methods (i.e. gene ex-
pression) are in place to study how changes in eu-
trophication (phosphorus-level) patterns over the past
century have inﬂuenced how an organism like a daph-
niid can respond to ecosystem/environmental change.
Results from this cross-disciplinary study will provide
an excellent example of how man-made environmental
changes (via eutrophication) inﬂuence natural (fresh-
water) ecosystems.

UppsalaU SexRoleReversal
Postgraduate (PhD) position (doktorandtj¨ anst) in An-
imal Ecology
The Department of Ecology and Evolution at the Uni-
versity of Uppsala seeks a new PhD candidate for the
project “The evolution of sex-role reversal in seed bee-
tles”.
Recent research on sexual selection and mating system
evolution have shown that the evolution of sex diﬀer-
ences can be more complex than previously appreci-
ated. Although this does not undermine our general un-
derstanding of the evolutionary mechanisms involved,
several areas are poorly understood. For example, the
study of sexual selection in females has received little
attention and our understanding of the evolution of sex-October 1, 2009 EvolDir 33
role reversal is incomplete. Seed beetles (Bruchidae) is
a model system which is very amenable for doing ex-
perimental work. This project will study a seed beetle
genus (Megabruchidius) in which the conventional sex-
roles are reversed, such that females search for mates,
court males actively and males seem discriminating.
Topics may include describing the economics of this
mating system, studying sexual selection in females,
quantifying Bateman gradients and will include a long-
term experimental evolution study. A comparative ap-
proach is also possible, as we harbor several closely re-
lated species with conventional sex-roles in the labora-
tory. The ultimate goal is to develop an understanding
of the evolution of sex-role reversal in this system.
The successful candidate should have a MSc (or
equivalent) in biology/ecology and a strong interest
in evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology. The
candidate will join a collaborative and growing research
group, currently consisting of 1 other PhD student,
2 postdoctoral associates, one senior scientist (G¨ oran
Arnqvist) and several aﬃliated members of the lab.
G¨ oran Arnqvist will function as a supervisor (see
< http://www.ebc.uu.se/zooeko/GoranA/GA.html
>http://www.ebc.uu.se/zooeko/GoranA/GA.html)
and the candidate will receive her/his post-
graduate training within the postgraduate
school at the Evolutionary Biology Centre
(see < http://www.ebc.uu.se/index eng.php
>http://www.ebc.uu.se/index eng.php). This po-
sition is ﬁnanced for four full years, and the successful
candidate will receive a postgraduate fellowship the
ﬁrst year (15.500 SEK/month) and a postgraduate
position year 2-4 (20.400 - 23.600 SEK/month).
Applications should include (1) personal informa-
tion/background, (2) complete CV (3) a description
of undergraduate training, (4) an authorized copy of
the undergraduate degree and (5) the names and email
addresses of two-three referees. Applications should

PhD project: Modelling the Evolution of Enzyme

University of St Andrews funding details: Competition
Funded Project - UK/EU Students only closing date:
30 Sept 2009
Contact: jbom@st-andrews.ac.uk +44-1334 467259
In this project, we will develop a computational model
for how enzyme mechanisms evolve. Our group’s previ-
ous work has developed reaction step ﬁngerprints con-
taining information about how the bond order, charge,
and chemical connectivity change in each reaction step
in our MACiE database of enzyme-catalysed reactions.
The ﬁngerprints provide a ﬁne-tuneable means of quan-
tifying mechanism-based similarities between enzyme-
catalysed chemical reactions, which can also be used for
clustering. First, the pairwise similarities between the
steps in two reactions are computed. A global align-
ment between the two series of steps is then performed
using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, just as for se-
quence alignment in bioinformatics. Existing evolution-
ary models are designed for comparing DNA or protein
sequences, and consider insertions, deletions and muta-
tions as the units of evolutionary change. However, an
evolutionary model for reaction mechanisms must be
adapted in order to compare chemical reactions.
We will create a simulation using a population of model
enzyme-catalysed reactions, mimicking a state early in
evolutionary history, and allow them to evolve in EC
space. The reactions will consist of steps and be rep-
resented, in a manner familiar from genetic algorithms,
by “chromosomes” describing the chemical properties
of each step. Parameters will control the likelihood of
diﬀerent kinds of evolutionary event, such as a change
of substrate with the same underlying chemical mecha-
nism, taking place. The simulations will be calibrated,
and then compared with the results from a study of
real-world convergent and divergent evolution.

PhD position in plant molecular cytogenetics/genome
evolution
One full-time PhD position in plant molecular cytoge-
netics/genome evolution is available for 3 years in the
Department of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany,
University of Vienna, Austria starting November 2009.
The position is part of the FWF (Austrian Science
Fund) project “Origin and genome evolution of chro-
mosomal races in the polyploid complex of Prospero
autumnale (Hyacinthaceae)”. The project focuses on a
chromosomally highly variable monocotyledonous plant
complex which comprises diploids with diﬀerent base
chromosome numbers (x = 5, 6, 7), as well as numer-
ous auto- and allopolyploids. Essentially, every known
form of chromosome mutation has been detected in
this group. A thorough investigation of the cytological
features of this remarkable group employing repetitive
DNA analyses and the interpretation of changes in a
sound phylogenetic context will allow addressing evolu-
tionary questions concerning the origins, mechanisms,
directions and frequencies of chromosomal changes. Ul-
timately it will allow establishment of the role of chro-
mosome change in race formation and speciation.
The project is based on an integrative approach utiliz-
ing molecular cytogenetic and molecular biology tech-
niques, bioinformatics (analyses of deep-sequencing
data) and molecular phylogenetic approaches. Project
will be performed in international collaboration with
the groups in UK (Dr. A. Leitch, Dr. I. Leitch, Dr. J.
Parker), and in Czech Republic (Dr. J. Macas).
The successful candidate should hold a European or
equivalent Master degree in biology/botany/molecular
biology or related ﬁeld. Prior practical experience
in plant cytogenetics (chromosome preparation, FISH)
and basic molecular biology techniques (PCR, DNA la-
beling, cloning) is preferred. The candidate should be
motivated, good team player, and proﬁcient in English
(written and oral).
Please send an application including CV, a list of pub-
lications, a brief outline of research experience and sci-
entiﬁc interests (max. one page), and two reference
letters. Review of applications will begin immediately

UZurich EvolvedPhysiology
Hormones, Metabolism and Behavior:
Interactions and Causal Relationships
We are looking for a PhD candidate to study causal
inﬂuences of hormones on alternative male reproduc-
tive tactics in the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys
pumilio). The main aim of our research group is to
understand the evolved physiological mechanisms that
allow animals to behave adaptively in a changing envi-
ronment. In the proposed study we want to test for a
causal inﬂuence of hormones on social behavior while
taking into account interactions between the diﬀerent
hormones and resting metabolic rate. The study will be
based at the University of Zurich and all experiments
will be conducted with a captive colony, for which
the PhD student will be responsible. The study will
use methods of hormone manipulations via implants,
hormone measurements, measurements of oxygen con-
sumption (RMR) and behavioral observations. See the
summary below.
We are seeking a highly-motivated, independent can-
didate with excellent organizational skills. The ideal
candidate has a background in evolution, animal be-
havior, behavioral endocrinology, or physiology, some
experience with animal handling, laboratory work, and
experience in experimental design and statistical anal-
ysis of data. A degree equivalent to a diploma or MSc
in Biology is required. Good knowledge of written and
spoken English is essential. The working language in
our group is English. Some knowledge of German would
be beneﬁcial for living in Switzerland but is not neces-
sary.The PhD student will be responsible for the captive
colony of striped mice (1 room), including cleaning of
cages and all other aspects of animal care. Manage-
ment of a captive colony of rodents includes euthaniz-
ing striped mice to keep the size of the colony down
and after experiments. The student will have to visit
of course of laboratory animal care at the University of
Zurich, paid by us.
The student will be supervised by Dr. Carsten Schradin
and be part of the research group studying striped
mice (see www.stripedmouse.com ). The student will
be based at the Department of Animal Behavior at
the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich
(www.zool.uzh.ch ). Zurich is a highly attractive city
in beautiful surroundings, with a multinational popu-
lation, and many educational and recreational oppor-
tunities ( http://www.zuerich.com )
The position is funded for two years, and the salary
follows the Swiss National Science Foundation scale
(CHF 39 600 for the ﬁrst year, CHF 42 600 for
the second year). The student is expected to ap-
ply for funding for a third year and for research ex-
penses from other foundations, for example from the
Forschungskredit, a foundation based at the University
of Zurich ( http://www.researchers.uzh.ch/promotion/-
forschungskredit.html ). The student will get full sup-
port from Dr. Carsten Schradin when applying for ad-
ditional grants.
The earliest starting date is January 2010.
Deadline for application is the 8th of October, and in-
terviews will take place at the end of October. If not
enough suitable applicants applied by this deadline, a
second call will be released and interviews will then take
place January 2010.
Please send your application including a CV (as PDF),
PDFs of publications (published, in press or in prepa-
ration), PDF of your diploma or master thesis, a letter
outlining your past research and particular motivation
for this position (max. 2 pages), as well as contact
details of 2 referees to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch.

Summary
The newly established ﬁeld of endocrine ecology has in-
creased our knowledge about how physiological mech-
anisms enable animals to be successful and survive in
challenging environments. However, so far most stud-
ies are correlative, especially in mammals. If exper-
iments are conducted, interactions between hormones
are normally not taken into account, nor are the possi-
ble eﬀects of hormones on other important physiologicalparameters such as metabolic rate. Since 2001 we have
conducted ﬁeld studies on the African striped mouse
(Rhabdomys pumilio) in the Succulent Karoo desert.
The striped mouse is now one of the best studied mam-
mal species in the ﬁeld of endocrine ecology, enabling

MasseyU Bioinformatics
The Institute of Molecular BioSciences at Massey Uni-
versity, New Zealand is oﬀering a Summer Scholarship
available from November 2009 to February 2010. We
are looking for a motivated student, either an upper
undergraduate (B.Sc., B.Sc. (Hons) or equivalent) or
recent graduate (M.Sc. or equivalent), looking to im-
prove their skills in bioinformatics and next generation
sequencing.
The Scholarship will be held over the Southern Hemi-
sphere’s summer. As such, this is a great opportunity
to extend your research training, while taking advan-
tage of the many travel opportunities that New Zealand
has to oﬀer. Palmerston North is close to the North
Island’s central mountains, with many options for hik-
ing, adventure sports and experiencing New Zealand’s
unique culture.
The project on oﬀer is:
Interrogating the Transcriptome of a Plant-Fungal
Symbiote using Next- Generation Sequencing With Dr
Murray Cox, Massey University, New Zealand
This study will determine the biological and evolution-
ary factors underlying the symbiotic relationship be-
tween a fungal endophyte (Epichlo¨ e festucae ﬂ1) and
its ryegrass host (Lolium perenne). Fungal endophytesOctober 1, 2009 EvolDir 45
produce a range of secondary metabolites that help pro-
tect their host plants from insect attack, and this par-
ticular relationship is especially important for the man-
agement of pasture quality. However, the molecular ba-
sis of plant-fungal symbiosis is not well understood. Dr
Murray Cox and Professor Barry Scott are currently
employing a second-generation sequencing technology
(Solexa) to study the molecular causes of this interac-
tion. By sampling E. festucae grown in planta, we will
obtain the transcriptomes (i.e., mRNA complements) of
both plant and fungus. By comparing diﬀerential gene
expression in wildtype E. festucae relative to a parasitic
mutant, we aim to identify which genes have evolved to
control and maintain this symbiosis between plant and
fungus.
Note: This project will provide computational biology
training for a young scientist. There is no laboratory
component, and the scholarship recipient will need ad-
vanced computational skills, as s/he will be handling
substantial quantities of second-generation sequencing
data, as well as analyzing the entire gene complements
of two non-model organisms. The recipient will need
some knowledge of UNIX and programming, or willing-
ness and an aptitude to obtain these skills.
Scholarships are for a nominal period of 12 weeks, from
16th November 2009 to 12th February 2010 (dates may
be negotiable), have a total value of NZD$6,000, and
will be awarded on the basis of academic merit. New
Zealand citizens and permanent residents are strongly
encouraged to apply, but all applications will be consid-
ered. Please send a cover letter, CV, and the names of
two references to Ann Truter (a.truter@massey.ac.nz)
by 25 September 2009. Further details can be found

forest Drosophila
Applications are invited for a Research Technician to
work on a NERC-funded project with Dr Jon Bridle.
This research will combine ecological and quantitative
genetic studies of natural populations to test popula-
tion genetic models for limits to adaptation at range
margins. It will focus on estimating adaptive diver-
gence, gene ﬂow, population density, and ﬁtness alongseveral ecological gradients between high and low al-
titude rainforest in northern Queensland. Addressing
these issues is crucial for assessing dangerous levels of
environmental change.
The research involves collaboration with Profs Mark
Blows (Queensland), Ary Hoﬀmann (Melbourne), and
Nick Barton (Vienna), and will require spending ex-
tended periods in the ﬁeld, and approximately six
months per year in Australia.
Successful applicants will need a strong commitment
to research, a background in ecology and evolutionary
study, and the ability and desire to work under diﬃ-
cult ﬁeld conditions, as well as in conducting detailed
laboratory experiments, sometimes during unsociable
hours. Experience in working with insects and in molec-
ular genetics, particularly SNP or microsatellite geno-
typing is essential.
A full driving license is essential. The position will be
for 36 months, with a start time during January 2010,

Dear evoldir,
our biology department is having a stand at a science
fare and our subject is about evolution and adaptations
in nature. Our main goal is to inspire young students
to study biology.
As part of the stand we want to have photos and videos
showing examples of diﬀerent kinds of adaptations and
evolutionary strategies. If anyone can recommend cool
photos and videos that we can show we would be very
grateful.

DPGP 40Drosophila genomes
DPGP announces the availability of Release 1.0 of “50
D. melanogaster genomes”
The Drosophila Population Genome Project released
today the reference version (Release 1.0) of the initial
sample of Drosophila melanogaster genomes sequenced
by the DPGP using ﬁrst generation (single-end and 36
bp) Solexa/Illumina technology and assembled using
maq 0.6.8.The sample consists of the sequences for the 5 major
chromosome arms (X, 2L, 2R, 3L and 3R) for 37 in-
bred genomes from Trudy Mackay’s set of inbred lines
sampled in Raleigh, NC and a set of sequenced chromo-
somes (7 chrXs, 6 chr2s and 5 chr3s) from a sample of
Malawi isofemale lines that were inbred using balancers.
The data for each chromosome arm are in FASTQ for-
mat and list of the regions of residual heterozygosity
and identity by descent are attached. Repeated se-
quence are ﬁltered (set to “N”). The “raw data” are
available in the NCBI Short Read Trace Archive. The
average coverage of the unique portions of all these
genomes is >10X.
Release 1.0 data can be accessed at <http://-
www.dpgp.org/ >.

Ecuador FieldAssist AvianEvolution
Field assistant to study a cooperative breeding system
in South America
We are looking for a highly motivated ﬁeld assistant
to join us working on the breeding system of the en-
dangered El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi). The ap-
parently cooperative breeding system is studied for the
ﬁrst time in this species. Until now cooperative be-
haviour has been seldom observed in parakeets and
our work focuses on the factors underlying the devel-
opment of delayed dispersal and cooperative breeding.
More details about the project can be looked up at:
www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/data/bio1/schaefer/ .
Fieldwork will take place at Buenaventura reserve
(www.fjocotoco.org ) near Pinas, southwest Ecuador.
Fieldwork includes capturing birds with mist nets and
inside artiﬁcial nest boxes, taking morphometric mea-
surements and blood samples, banding of birds and ﬁeld
observation of parakeet ﬂocks. The parakeet ﬂocks are
distributed throughout the whole reserve and adjacent
areas, therefore long and exhausting daily treks across
the foothills of the Andes are unavoidable. Fieldwork
will be done during rainy season and we will work 5-6
days a week. Moreover, batteries ( ~3kg) for nest cam-
eras have to be changed every two days. The project
will cover the costs for ﬂight and accommodation at the
reserve. If required, a letter of recommendation will be
draw up. The position is available from January until
end of April 2010.October 1, 2009 EvolDir 61

Fish life tables
Dear Evoldir list,
I am looking for life table data for both sex changing

ﬁsh. I need the type of life history data that would go
into a Leslie matrix. Ideally, this would be age-speciﬁc
abundance, survival (lx) and fecundity (bx) values for
both sexes, as well as information about the transition
between sexes. These data are hard to get, so stage-
speciﬁc data would help. If you can point me toward

vant it would help a lot.Best regards,

Glaciation GeneticDiversity
Dear colleagues,
I am hoping someone on the EvolDir site will be able to
help me out. I wish to simulate the impacts of glacia-
tion on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity, but
am uncertain what programs are availble for such a
purpose.
Speciﬁally, I wish to simulate the impacts of a popu-
lation bottleneck (maintained for ’x’ generations) and
subsequent population expansion on the spatial distri-
bution of genetic diversity (Ho, R) for a multiple mi-
crosatellite markers. Supposedly, this is too compli-
cated a process for EASYPOP. Ideally the simulation
program would be able to model either a one dimen-
sional stepping stone model, and/or leptokurtic disper-
sal.
I have no leads at this time, so any advice is greatly
appreciated.

Here are the responses, which I have edited to maintain
anonymity:
1) You could try splatche (v. 1.1) (for SPatiaL And
Temporal Coalescences in Heterogenous Environment),
developed by Excoeﬃer and colleagues
2) You can do this in SimCoal2 (Excoﬃer’s
group; http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/simcoal2/ ) or
Dick Hudson’s ms (upon which SimCoal is partly writ-
ten).
3) I think IBDSim is the simulation program you’re
looking for. http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/ ˜ rousset/-
IBDSim.html 4)One simulation program that will
likely do what you want is called SIMDIV that was writ-
ten by Jody Hey. There is not a paper describing the
program, but you can ﬁnd documentation, and down-October 1, 2009 EvolDir 63
load the program, from Jody Hey’s website ( http://-
lifesci.rutgers.edu/˜heylab/ ). You can specify many pa-
rameters including: time since divergence, Ne of popu-
lations before and after divergence, growth rates of pop-
ulations before and after divergence, etc... It is fairly
comprehensive.
5) See Carr and Marshall. 2008. Intraspeciﬁc phylo-
geographic genomics from multiple complete mtDNA
genomes in Atlantic cod. Genetics 180: 381-389.
6)I list a bunch of simulation programs in http://-
simupop.sourceforge.net/Main/Features (people may
have other suggestions) and you may ﬁnd one of
them (perhaps Bottleneck?) usable. If none of them
works for your application, please be assured that
simuPOP can certainly simulate the evolutionary
process that you need, provided that you know
exactly what to simulate, and you or someone in
your group can program in Python. Your email did
not describe your simulation in detail, but I guess
you can use a demographic model with bottleneck
and migration ( http://simupop.sourceforge.net/-
manual/build/4 userGuide.html#demographic-
changes ), and self-deﬁned statistics ( http:/-
/simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/-
4userGuide.html#statistics-calculation-operator-stat
and http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/-
6userGuide.html#output-statistics because I am not
sure what your Ho and R are). The landscape genetics
example in the simuPOP online cookbook ( http:/-
/simupop.sourceforge.net/cookbook/pmwiki.php/-
Cookbook/LandscapeGenetics ) might help. Please feel
free to join the simuPOP mailinglist and discuss your
simulation there.
7)It sounds like what you’re interested in is very simi-
lar to: Jesus, F. F., J. Wilkins, and J. Wakeley, 2006.
Expected coalescence times and segregating sites in a
model of glacial cycles. Genetics and Molecular Re-
search 5:466-474. The software is available at John
Wakeley’s website. Its in C and you’ll need to know
some of the language in order to get it up and running.

“Marlin” which provides a graphical user interface for
creating spatially explicit simulations, and which can
only model colonizations with diﬀerent dispersal mod-

Link genetic distance
Dear community,
I am looking for software for phylogenetic inferences
which implements the Link et al. (1995) distance mea-
sure as for example TREECON. The problem with
Treecon is that I cannot access the generated boot-
strap trees I need for further analysis in other programs.
I tried it with the similar Jaccard formulae on which
Link’s distance measure is based and which works ﬁne
in FAMD but although the topology of the NJ tree
based on Jaccard is the same the bootstrap values dif-
fer considerably. NeiLi is also no alternative.
Any help would be highly appreciated,
regards,
Matthias

Longworth traps wanted
Hi, I’m after around 80 Longworth traps to supplement
those I already have for a PhD project involving the
St Kilda ﬁeldmouse. I’m sure there must be hundreds
around the UK sitting unused, if anyone would be will-
ing to put some on long term loan (3 years) I’d be very
grateful.

Microarray service facilities
Folks–
Some changes in our in-house microarray facility are
leading me to explore alternative service facilities.
I’m looking for recommendations on aca-
demic/commercial operations where I can have
custom two-color microarrays hybridized & scanned.
Ideally, I’m looking for a service facility where I can
send the arrays I already have printed, and samples
(either at the RNA extraction or labelled cDNA stage)
and get data back as .gpr/.tiﬀs or equivalent.
I’m particularly interested in a facility that uses one of
the new high-res scanners.
If you’ve actually used such a facility, I’d like to know
whether your experience has been positive/negative,
what turnaround time is, and cost information.
Though I myself would like a USA-based facility, I’ll
compile & post any responses I get. You can email me
at dudycha @ biol.sc.edu

Software Metapop update
Dear Evoldir members,
A new version of Metapop (1.0.1), a software for
management and genetic diversity analysis of subdi-
vided populations in conservation programs, is available
in the website ( http://webs.uvigo.es/anpeﬁ/metapop/-
). This is a critical update because this version solves
a bug present in the previous version (1.0.0). That bug
appeared if there were missing alleles and there were
also rare alleles only present in the last individuals of
the population. In that case, such rare alleles were not
always taken in the calculations, given to wrong ﬁnal
results. If you have made some analysis with Metapop
1.0.0 and you had missing alleles, I strongly recommend
to repeat analysis with this new version. I apologize for
any inconvenience caused by this bug.66 EvolDir October 1, 2009
There is also available in the website a new highly
demanded tool for conversion of genepop ﬁles into
metapop (G2M). There are two options, a stand-alone
installer only for Windows users, and the source python
script (multi-platform) that needs a previous installa-
tion of python and biopython.
You can address any inquiry about this software to an-
peﬁ@uvigo.es

Tree reliability answers
Answers to tree reliability test question
Dear all,
Many thanks for all the replies to my question. The
comments were really helpful and to the beneﬁt of all I
am posting the answers back to Evoldir.
My question was:
I am using a nuclear DNA marker to study the ge-
netic diﬀerentiation among populations within an in-
sect species complex. Using the Mega software I ob-
tained an unrooted Neighbor Joining tree inferred from
Fst matrix values. However, for pairwise distance input
data ﬁles the program does not oﬀer an option to assess
the reliability of the tree since there is no nucleotide
information to perform a bootstrap test. I was won-
dering if it would be possible to use the bootstrap re-
sampling technique to compute 1000 pairwise distance
matrixes. From this point, several trees could then be
reconstructed. Next, the topologies of those trees could
be comparedto that of the original tree and the boot-
strap value for each branch could be computed. Does
anybody know if there is a software that can perform
the testin this manner?
Here are the answers I received:
Answer 1.
Your proposal to generate bootstrap samples sounds
reasonable to me. PHYLIP has a program that gen-
erates pseudosamples from sequence data. You then
could use other programs from PHYIP or any other
program to analyze the samples. Jeﬀ Thorne’s statal-
ign program had a module that allowed to generate
pseudosamples of distance matrices, when the SE of
the pairwise distances could be estimated. But I think
MEGA also has the capability to create and analyze68 EvolDir October 1, 2009
pseudosamples.

Answer 2..
Bom dia Luiz,
para reiterar os datos, eu usei o PHYLIP ( http:/-
/evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html ), mas
acho que deve ser com marcadores gen´ eticos n˜ ao lig-
ados. No Phylip, abre o “Seqboot” para multiplicar
os seus datos. Logo, abre o “Gendist” para calcu-
lar as matrices de distancias (com a op¸ c˜ ao M: Mul-
tiple data) Depois o “Neighbor” para fazer as ar-
vores, depois o “Consensus” para construir o NJT
consensus, e no ﬁnal o “drawtree” (ou “drawgram”)
para vˆ e-lo com as valores. Em cada etapa, o Phylip
lhe faz um outﬁle ou um outﬁle e um outtree.
Vocˆ e tem que usa-los para a etapa seguinte. Mel-
hor ´ e rechama-los em nomequevcquer.txt Tb o pro-
grama Treeview ( http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/-
rod/treeview.html ) est` a bem bonitinho para ver os NJT
com bootstrap.
Sorte, Cordialmente, St´ ephane.
Answer 3.
I have been trying to do the same - with limited suc-
cess. You can try PAUP - but again the same problem
with bootstraps. The program Populations by Lan-
gella - download from http://www.bioinformatics.org/-
project/ﬁlelist.php?group idYou can enter your data,
and ask the programme to calculate Fst for you and
then it performs the bootsrap. Problem I’ve had is
that after 100 bootstraps it crashes. If anyone passes a
solution that works, could you email me please.
Kind regards Clare Marsden
Answer 4.
Hi Luiz, if you are using genotypic nuclear data (al-
lozymes, microsats, SNPs) and need several distances
matrices and trees with bootstrap, I would simply sug-
gets using the software POPULATIONS from Langella,
availbale at http://www.bioinformatics.org/project/-
?group id=84 . cheers, Greg
Answer 5.
Luis Guilherme \240Bauzer –
My package PHYLIP can bootstrap gene frequency
data, make a distance matrix for each boostrap sam-
ple, and compute trees from each sample. The boot-
strapping is of whole loci, which means you must have
many loci, not just one locus. Of course, you are as-
suming that the relationships among populations are
adequately summarized by a tree, and not much inﬂu-enced by gene ﬂow after splitting of populations. Oth-
erwise you should investigate using coalescent meth-
ods, such as Mary Kuhner’s LAMARC package or Pe-
ter Beeli’s MIGRATE. If both splitting and gene ﬂow
are important, Rasmus Nielsen and Jody Hey’s package
IMa would be needed.
J.F.
Answer 6.
Luiz-
You can do this with with the PHYLIP
package from Felsenstein’s group. http://-
evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html First
you use SeqBoot to create the bootstrap samples,
then GenDist, to get your genetic distance matrices
(it doesn’t make Fst) and then Neighbor to make
your trees, and then Consense to get your bootstrap
consensus tree and nodal support values. It is a little
cumbersome, but not so bad once you learn to use it.
I hope that this helps. Carlos
Answer 7.
You can do this with Phylip ( http://-

Dear EvolDir members,
I am pleased to announce an upcoming event at the
University of Guelph in celebration of Darwin Year.
This View of Life: Evolutionary Art for the Year of
Darwin
University of Guelph and Ed Video Oct. 9 - 30 Re-
ception Oct. 16, 5:00-7:00pm Science Complex Atrium
Admission is free
This View of Life showcases the melding of artistic
and scientiﬁc disciplines in this year of celebration for
Charles Darwin. This group exhibition presents re-
cent work from contemporary Canadian artists and fea-
tures several collaborative projects created with scien-
tists from the University of Guelph.
The investigation of evolutionary theory is not limited
to the lab, ﬁeld or fossil bed. Darwinian theory, after a
century and a half, continues to inspire creativity which
perpetuates the evolution of these ideas in their own
right. Forms of expression can be compared to instru-
ments of observation, magnifying some aspects of evo-
lution while masking or distorting others. Presented by
the University of Guelph and Ed Video, these exhibits
oﬀer unique perspectives into the nature and scope of
biological novelty, organic variation, and evolving life
forms.
The reception will feature artwork, biological speci-
mens, and presentations by project participants. Art-
work will also be exhibited at the Ed Video Gallery and
at various locations on campus for the duration of the
show.
For more information, please visit:University of Guelph – http://arts.uoguelph.ca/-

Visible Implant Elastomer for
reptiles answers
Thanks a lot to those who replied to my request about
using VIE in reptiles and to everyone who supports
evoldir, you’re a great help!
My original post was:
Dear all,
we are planning to use Visible Implant Elastomer for in-
dividual marking in several reptile species in Madagas-
car (Furcifer, Oplurus, Zonosaurus, Tracheloptychus).
As this method is mainly used in ﬁsheries, we are won-
dering if anyone has experience with using VIE in rep-
tiles? Ideally, we would like to test the usability of the
marking in reptiles before we order the kits, so it would
be great if we can get in contact with someone who is
working with VIE in (northern) Germany?!?
I received positive feedback for several species, below
are some answers:
I have used VIE on ﬂat lizards (Platysaurus broadleyi)
in South Africa,. It worked quite well, it took a lot
longer to mark each individual than toe clipping. The
study was only short term (1 month), so I don’t know
how useful it is for long term, but I presume it would
still be visible after a longer time. I think it will be
more successful on species that have thin and/or trans-
parent skin, like geckos. I injected the ﬂat lizards on
the ventral side of their hind legs, just under the skin,
because the skin was thinest there.
We have used VIE tags on Anolis sagrei lizards for
years. The method works very well. Tags are easy
to read and do not appear to cause any trauma to
the animals. We inject a small amount of elastomer
subcutaneously into the underside of each limb so that70 EvolDir October 1, 2009
animals have a 4-color identiﬁcation (e.g., Red-Blue-
Green-Yellow). We mark hundreds of lizards each year,
and we mark animals as small as 1 g in total mass.
A very small percentage of tags are lost (they harden
and presumably slip out the injection site), but this is
a minor concern. The only potential concern might be
if your species have dark or colorful ventral coloration
that would make it diﬃcult to read the colors. Our
anoles are white and have translucent skin, so it’s easy
to identify each color.
One reference was also given: Kondo, J, SJ Downes.2004. Using Visible implant elastomer to individually
mark geckos. Herpetofauna 34:19-22.
Best of all, we did actually receive some material from
France to test the method ourselves, thanks a lot for
this fantastic help!

HullU AncientDNA
Postdoctoral Research Associate in ancient DNA
Biological Sciences
Applications are invited for a 3-year postdoctoral po-
sition at Hull University, investigating the medieval
development of the European commercial ﬁsh trade
using ancient DNA recovered from archaeological ex-
cavations. This exciting collaboration with archaeol-
ogists at Cambridge University, funded by the Lev-
erhulme Trust, will utilise molecular genetic markers
(SNPs) and zooarchaeological techniques to determine
the likely geographical origin of discarded cod bones
from medieval middens, thus allowing early trading
routes and the birth of commercial ﬁshing to be traced.
Applicants should have a PhD in molecular ecology or a
related ﬁeld, ideally with a minimum of 2-3 years post-
doctoral experience in the application of molecular ge-
netic markers, preferably utilising degraded DNA from
archaeological, archived, or non-invasive samples. Ex-
perience of working with SNPs would be advantageous,
although not essential, as would statistical analysis of
population structuring. Candidates should be commit-
ted to timely publishing in high-impact journals, be ca-
pable of collaborative independent research, and enjoy
the challenge of an innovative project.
The candidate will join a dynamic group of eco-
logical and evolutionary biologists (see http://-
www.hull.ac.uk/evolution/ ), with diverse interests
spanning population genetics, phylogeography, applied
conservation, behavioural ecology, and the evolution
of functional traits. The Department possesses three
well-equipped molecular genetic laboratories, with au-
tomated sequencers, a real-time PCR machine, and a
liquid handling robot, along with a bioinformatics suite
and a dedicated ancient DNA facility.

The following postdoctoral project is part of NOV-
ELTREE large-scale integrating project (May 2008-
April 2012), which aims at developing improved breed-
ing strategies in the context of forest tree breeding
programs. The present postdoctoral project involves
two alternative sub-projects. Candidates must have
a strong background in at least one of the two sub-
projects (see below), in which the successful candidate
will focus her/his research eﬀorts, with the possibility
to be involved in the other sub-project depending on
the capabilities/interest of the candidate.
Objective(s) Two sub-projects are proposed whose re-
spective objectives are: - Implementation of bayesian
and MCMC methods for statistical inferences with mul-
tivariate phenotypic and genotypic records in genetic
evaluation for poplar breeding (denoted hereafter sub-
project A). - Optimization of breeding meta-population
structures for genetic improvement purposes by using
allele-based simulations under non-additive assump-
tions (denoted hereafter sub-project B). These two ob-
jectives are related to each other in the context of a
breeding program. While the ﬁrst objective concerns
the preliminary phase of genetic evaluation of candi-
dates to selection by using best suited statistical tools,
the second objective concerns the subsequent phase of
weighting selection decisions observing other breedingconstraints that are aimed at preserving a given di-
versity structure by using optimization and simulation
tools.
Context Concerning the sub-project A, one important
breakthrough in computational statistics has been the
MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) with a rapid adap-
tation to the needs of quantitative genetics, particularly
in the genetic evaluation in animal breeding. One of the
beneﬁts leading this expansion is the huge ﬂexibility of
the models that can be implemented under MCMC,
especially from a Bayesian perspective, which is in con-
trast with the strictness of standard methods of statis-
tical analysis based on inﬁnite size inferences. Few are
still the examples with MCMC applied to forest tree
breeding, despite the fact that some circumstances in
these programs appear particularly favorable to the ap-
plication of these techniques. Often with designed selec-
tion experiments involving diﬀerent sources of pheno-
typic and genotypic records, an elaborate multivariate
structure with a large number of nuisance parameters is
needed for ﬁtting. Conversely, there is a certain scarcity
of resources available being used in the test. These two
circumstances dictate much uncertainty about the pa-
rameters to be inferred. Arguably, inference based on
asymptotic theory is not expected to be satisfactory
under these limiting circumstances. Other complica-
tions arise when data available is not the result of ran-
dom sampling and selection has already modiﬁed the
genetic composition of the population from which data
is to be obtained. An alternative to overcome these
diﬃculties is the Bayesian approach. MCMC is a very
important computational tool in Bayesian statistics, as
it allows inferences from complex distributions where
analytical or numerical integration is not available. Re-
garding the sub-project B, breeding populations com-
prise often several interconnected breeding units, each
one serving a particular breeding purpose, being the
result of a given geographical origin distinct from the
other units or being a diﬀerent species able to inter-
breed with the other species in the breeding population.
This latter case is the one of the poplar breeding pro-

*Post-doc position in Evolution and Bioinformatics
(Marseille, France)*
A 12 months post-doc position is available in our
group “*Biologie cellulaire de la motilit´ e bact´ erienne*”,

the team is available at ( http://lcb.cnrs-mrs.fr/-spip.php?rubrique83 < http://lcb.cnrs-mrs.fr/-
spip.php?rubrique86 >).
Our group studies basic mechanisms of bacterial motil-
ity. Using a combination of genetic and cell biology ap-
proaches, we have discovered novel genes that may en-
code a new motility apparatus in /Myxococcus //xan-
thus// /(Delta-Proteobacteria). An extensive biologi-
cal study of this new system, also requires its character-
ization by /in silico/ approaches. Within this context,
the applicant will perform a phylogenomic study of this
putative new system and address three main questions:
- What is the taxonomic distribution of the components
of this system in bacteria? What are their evolutionary
origins and how have they evolved? - Which bacteria
also harbor this putative system? - What is the com-
plete set of genes involved in this motility system?
Conclusions from this study will be tested experimen-
tally. This way, we hope to collect data allowing a
better characterization of this system and the under-
standing of its origin and evolution in Bacteria.
The applicant will work in collaboration with the
“Genome, Evolution and Bioinformatics” team under
the supervision of C´ eline Brochier ( http://lcb.cnrs-
mrs.fr/spip.php?rubrique86 ).
Qualiﬁcations and experience that are required:
Applicants should have:
- A PhD in biology or in bioinformatics - A good knowl-
edge of current molecular phylogeny and bioinformatics
tools

skills in C/C++, excellent knowledge of probability
theory and stochastic processes, and good familiarity
with theoretical/computational statistics is required.
The ideal candidate would have a Ph.D. with empha-
sis on theoretical population genetics, human genomics,
statistical genetics/genomics, or computational statis-
tics. S/he will work on both publicly available data
(e.g., 1000 Genomes) as well as on genomes to be se-
quenced through other collaborative eﬀorts. There is
also ample opportunity for collaboration with the labs
of Andy Clark (Cornell), Rasmus Nielsen (Berkeley),
Alon Keinan (Cornell), and John Novembre (UCLA)
as part of these NIH funded positions.

MAR, University of the Algarve, Portugal
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher
position at the Centro de Ciencias do Mar (CC-
MAR), University of the Algarve (CCMAR - http:/-
/www.ccmar.ualg.pt/ ) in the research group of Cymon
J. Cox (Plant systematics and bioinformatics). The
successful applicant will participate in the project ti-
tled “The origin and early diversiﬁcation of plants: a
phylogenomic approach employing novel composition-
heterogeneous methods” funded by the Portuguese
Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT). The
project will be conducted in collaboration with T.M.
Embley (Newcastle University, UK) and P.G. Foster
(Natural History Museum, London, UK).
Background Plant chloroplasts are derived from an an-
cient endosymbiotic capture of a cyanobacterium by a
heterotrophic eukaryotic ancestor, an event which led
to the diversiﬁcation of three primary plant lineages,
namely, the glaucocystophytes, red algae, and green
plants, and the eventual emergence of terrestrial ecosys-
tems. The endosymbiosis marked a crucial episode
in cell and Earth history, yet our understanding of
the phylogenetic context surrounding this momentous
event remains obscure in part due to the technical limi-
tations of current phylogenetic methodology in relation
to the reconstruction of deep evolutionary divergences.
The project will be conducted entirely in silico and im-
plement novel non-stationary composition models in a
phylogenomic context. Ideally, the successful candidateOctober 1, 2009 EvolDir 83
will have a strong background in phylogenetic analy-
ses, Unix/Linux computing, and bioinformatics (biopy-
thon/bioperl, cluster management, relational databas-
ing, etc). An extensive publication record will also be
advantageous. The position is available for 3 years (af-
ter an intial 1 year probation) from January 2010 and
is open to all nationalities. The researcher will receive
a salary of 1495 euros/month.
Applications should be submitted before 15th October
2009 to Cymon J. Cox (cymon@ualg.pt). Applicants
should send a covering letter detailing their research
interests, a current C.V., and the email addresses for 3
professional referees. Informal inquires are welcome to
the same address.

PhylogenomicsNon-Bilateria
Munich, Germany: Research Associate (Post-Doc) po-
sition in molecular computational phylogenetics and
phylogenomics of non-bilaterian animals.
We invite applications for a research associate (Post-
Doc) position in a project funded by the German Re-
search Foundation (DFG) “A phylogenomic approach
to resolve deep phylogenetic incongruences among Phy-
lum Poriferaˆ a in the DFG Priority Programme 1174:
”Deep Metazoan Phylogeny“, co-funded by the Bavar-
ian Ministry for Science, Education and the Arts.
The project is located in the Molecular Geo- & Palaeo-

ronmental Sciences (Chair of Palaeontology) and the
GeoBioCenterLMU of the Ludwig-Maximilians- Uni-October 1, 2009 EvolDir 87
versit¨ at (LMU) M¨ unchen.
The phylogenetic relationships among non-bilaterians
(i.e. taxa Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria & Placozoa)
are still under hot debate and are far from being un-
equivocally resolved. Uncertainty exists about whether
poriferans (sponges) are a monophyletic group or a pa-
raphyletic assemblage, and the branching order of taxa
Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Placozoa is still debated.
However, our recent phylogenomic results revive clas-
sical concepts about non-bilaterian relationships in re-
covering monophyletic Porifera and a sister-group re-
lationship of Cnidaria and Ctenophora (Coelenterata)
(Philippe et al. 2009, Current Biology).
In the framework of this project, you can build on more
than 40,000 EST sequences and will have access to cur-
rently being sequenced transcriptomes of selected non-
bilaterian lineages. With these resources you will carry
out intensive phylogenomic analyses and have the op-
portunity for further analyses, e.g., to reconstruct the
evolution of key-genes and pathways.
This project will be carried out in collaboration with
Prof. B. Morgenstern of the Dept. of Bioinformatics at
the University of G¨ ottingen.
We are seeking a highly motivated applicant with ex-
cellent in silico molecular-phylogenetic/phylogenomic
and computational skills, demonstrated by an excellent
track-record of international publications in the ﬁeld.
The working language of the group is English, and ap-
plicants from abroad are encouraged to apply.
The successful candidate will join a young, interna-
tional and dynamic lab focussing on the molecular
palaeobiology (micro- and macroevolution) of marine
animals. More information about the lab can be found
atwww.mol-palaeo.de Requirements: PhD in Biol-
ogy or related ﬁeld; very good and demonstrated un-
derstanding of molecular evolution and computational
phylogenetics, including methods to infer molecular
phylogenies from large phylogenomic data sets, and
state-of-the art computer programs for such analyses;
excellent English language skills. Excellent and pro-
found knowledge of UNIX/LINUX and programming
skills in e.g. Perl or Python are essential.
The position is available for 24 months (starting from
01.01.2010) and will be paid according to the German
TV salary scheme TV-L E13.
Application: Send application including letter of intent,
CV, PDFs of your three most signiﬁcant publications,
and details of 2 referees as PDF (only) by email to Mrs.

UppsalaU mtDNA selection
Postdoctoral Researcher, Evolutionary Biology, Upp-
sala University
A postdoc position is available at the Dept. of
Ecology and Evolution, at the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre of Uppsala University, to study selec-
tion on mitochondrial DNA. The Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre hosts a number of independent research
programs and currently harbors well over 400 fac-
ulty, postdoc and PhD students. The EBC of-
fers an outstanding international scientiﬁc environment
in evolutionary biology (see http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
index eng.php ). This position will be located within
the Animal Ecology program ( http://www.iee.uu.se/-
zooekol/default.php?lang=en ) in the group led by
Prof. G¨ oran Arnqvist ( http://www.ebc.uu.se/zooeko/-
GoranA/GA.html ).
Our understanding of the evolution of mtDNA is cur-
rently undergoing a revolution: a view of mtDNA se-
quence variation as being strictly neutral is gradually
being replaced by one where mtDNA polymorphism
and evolution results from natural selection. However,
it is generally diﬃcult to understand how genetic vari-
ation in this maternally inherited and non-recombining
haploid genome can be maintained in the face of natural
selection. The primary aim of the current position is to
study selection on distinct mtDNA haplotypes empir-
ically, by controlled laboratory selection experiments.The most likely model system will be seed beetles of
the genus Callosobruchus, but other invertebrates may
also be employed in part based on the experience and
interests of the successful applicant.
The successful applicant will have a strong and doc-
umented interest in evolutionary biology and a PhD
within this general ﬁeld. Some background in genet-
ics, with experience of at least basic molecular methods
(PCR and sequencing), is highly desirable. Experience
of laboratory work with invertebrates, a strong interest
in natural selection/adaptation and past experience of

Postdoc in developing and applying comparative meth-
ods
PI: Brian O’Meara, U of Tennessee, Knoxville ( http:/-October 1, 2009 EvolDir 91
/www.brianomeara.info )
A 2-year postdoctoral position is available for de-
velopment, implementation, and application of meth-
ods for investigating trait evolution on trees. The
postdoc will be an active member of the trait evo-
lution working group of the iPlant Collaborative
(http://iplantcollaborative.org ), which is developing
approaches to understand trait evolution on plant phy-
logenies with hundreds of thousands of taxa as part
of iPlant’s broader mission to support cyberinfrastruc-
ture across the plant sciences (funding for this position
comes from iPlant).
The candidate can anticipate working in a highly col-
laborative, multi- institutional context that entails the
working groups on data set assembly (Doug Soltis (U
Florida), Pam Soltis (U Florida), Michael Donoghue
(Yale)), gene tree reconciliation (Todd Vision (UNC)),
high performance computing and scalable tree con-
struction (Alexandros Stamatakis (Technical Univer-
sity, Munich), Casey Dunn (Brown)), and tree visu-
alization (Michael Sanderson (U Arizona)). The mem-
bers of the trait evolution working group include Joe
Felsenstein (U Washington), David Ackerly (UC Berke-
ley), Rod Page (U Glasgow), and Jeremy Beaulieu
(Yale).
In addition to undertaking basic research in phyloge-
netic methods, the postdoc will be expected to provide
advice to and work in collaboration with cyberinfas-
tructure developers in the iPlant team. Qualiﬁcations
include familiarity with the data, methods, and soft-
ware of phylogenetic analysis, and programming expe-
rience at least at the level of R or Perl scripts. It is
always good to know botany, but this is not expected
for the position.
The position is located at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. Attractions of Knoxville include an active
and collaborative Ecology and Evolutionary Biology de-
partment ( http://eeb.bio.utk.edu ), a low cost of living,
a rich natural environment, and the new National Insti-
tute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis ( http:/-

Postdoc and PhD positions in genetic incompatibil-
ity/hybrid necrosis
Several years ago, the Weigel lab discovered that hy-
brid necrosis, a type of genetic incompatibility found
in many diﬀerent plants, also occurs in Arabidopsis
thaliana. Even though the underlying genetic basis
appears to be heterogeneous, a collaboration with the
Dangl lab established autoimmunity as the common
cause. Since our ﬁrst publication on hybrid necrosis in
2007 (Bomblies, Lempe et al., PLoS Biology 5, e236),
we have cloned several additional causal loci. Inter-
esting patterns are emerging for their molecular nature
and allelic diversity, and we are expanding our biochem-
ical and population genomic analyses of this interesting
phenomenon.
We are looking for additional postdocs and PhD stu-
dents to join an active team of ﬁve postdocs and PhD
students already working in this exciting area. Postdoc
applicants need to have published at least one ﬁrst-
author paper in an international journal. PhD students
must have a Masters degree in a relevant discipline and
need to document practical experience in molecular ge-
netics, biochemistry, population genetics and/or bioin-
formatics.
Apart from members of the Weigel lab, you will in-
teract with colleagues on a joint international HFSP
grant (with Jeﬀ Dangl [UNC]; Jonathan Jones [Sains-

Vienna DrosophilaAging
Postdoctoral Position in Mechanisms of Drosophila Ag-
ing
A postdoctoral research position in the biology of
*Drosophila* aging and physiology is available in the
group of Dr. Thomas Flatt at the University of Vet-
erinary Medicine (Department of Biomedical Research,
Institute of Population Genetics), Vienna, Austria
(http://i122server.vu-wien.ac.at/pop/Flatt website/-
ﬂatt home.html ). The postdoc position is funded by
a grant from the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF)
and will be for three years.
This research project will focus on the identiﬁcation
of the molecular basis of the trade-oﬀ between repro-
duction and lifespan in the fruit ﬂy, * Drosophila*
*melanogaster*, a powerful genetic model system. In
many organisms, from fruit ﬂies to humans, reproduc-
tion shortens lifespan, but the underlying mechanisms
remain largely unknown (see Flatt & Promislow 2007
in Science). Experiments in *C. elegans* suggest that
hormonal signals from the gonad aﬀect longevity (Hsin
& Kenyon 1999 in Nature), and we have recently found
that germline ablation extends lifespan and aﬀects in-
sulin signaling in *Drosophila* (Flatt et al. 2008 in
PNAS). However, the details of this systemic regula-
tion of lifespan by the reproductive system remain un-
clear. In our project we are interested in dissecting the
endocrine and physiological mechanisms that modu-
late the reproduction-longevity trade-oﬀ. By employing
mutant and transgene analysis, genetic manipulation of
the gonad, epistasis experiments, hormonal manipula-
tions, and physiological measurements we will examine
the mechanisms whereby signals from the reproductive
system modulate longevity.
We are seeking a highly talented, dynamic, indepen-
dent, and self-motivated young biologist with good so-
cial skills. The successful candidate will have a Ph.D.
and a strong background in genetics and molecular biol-
ogy using the *Drosophila* system. Some background
in the biology of aging, evolutionary biology, and/or
physiology and endocrinology would be ideal, but is not
required. The working language in the laboratory is En-
glish, so the candidate should be proﬁcient in spoken
and written English. German skills, although helpful,
are not essential. The initial appointment will be made
for one year, with a possible extension to up to threeyears. The annual salary is 54,180 Euro (before tax).
The position is available as of now, but the starting
date is negotiable.
In a 2009 world-wide survey by the William M. Mercer
Institute, Vienna ranked ﬁrst world-wide in terms of
standards of living. Vienna is a beautiful, historical yet
modern city, located in the heart of Europe, close to the
Alps and to major cities like Munich, Zurich, Prague,
and Budapest. Being famous for its concert sites, opera
houses, theathers, museums, and coﬀee shops, Vienna
also provides great outdoor activities, such as sailing
on the Neusiedler See, ice skating, biking and hiking
in the Viennese woods and the nearby Alps. More-
over, the city has a wide range of great restaurants,
bars, wineries, cinemas, clubs, libraries, galleries, and
art collections. The Vienna area is also an exceptional
and highly international research environment. Four
major life science universities and three world-class re-
search institutes (GMI, IMBA, IMP) provide a dy-
namic and interactive setting. Vienna hosts an active*
Drosophila* community, and the onsite availability of
the *Drosophila* RNAi center (VDRC) provides a great
opportunity for functional *Drosophila *work. In pop-
ulation genetics and evolutionary biology, the Vienna
research area also provides excellent prospects, due to
a growing number of evolutionary research groups.
To apply for this position, please send a single pdf ﬁle
including: (1) a cover letter explaining why you would
like to join our group, (2) your Curriculum Vitae (in-
cluding a description of your skills), (3) your publica-
tion list, (4) a statement of research interests, and (5)

NESCent Phyloinformatics VoCamp
OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
Integrating diverse biological data with the historical
process of evolution is a grand challenge for 21st cen-
tury biology. The interoperability of data from diverse
ﬁelds (e.g., genetics, ecology, biodiversity, biomedicine)
requires a technology infrastructure based on formal-October 1, 2009 EvolDir 99
ized, shared vocabularies. Developing such vocabular-
ies is a community project. In order to build controlled
vocabularies and ontologies, the National Evolution-
ary Synthesis Center (NESCent: http://nescent.org ) is
sponsoring a “Phyloinformatics VoCamp”.
We invite scientists from diverse sub-disciplines to ap-
ply for this event, as explained below. The applica-
tion deadline is September 18, 2009. More informa-
tion about motivation, plans, and preliminary ideas
is available online at http://bit.ly/VoCamp Proposal .
Feel free to disseminate this notice to colleagues who
may be interested.*
A VoCamp ( http://vocamp.org ) is an intense, hands-
on, working meeting with face-to-face interactions be-
tween a diverse group of people focused on vocabulary
and ontology design, development and application. The
Phyloinformatics VoCamp will include ontology and vo-
cabulary developers from relevant eﬀorts, experts on
knowledge representation and reasoning, and users and
developers of integrative applications that use these on-
tologies.
This event will partially overlap with the Biodiversity
Information Standards (TDWG: http://tdwg.org ) An-
nual Conference in Montpellier, France, November 9-
13, 2009. The VoCamp is an activity of the TDWG
Interest Group on Phylogenetics Standards ( http://-
wiki.tdwg.org/Phylogenetics ) and is partly supported
by TDWG and the Universit´ e Montpellier.
GOALS AND ACTIVITIES
The objective of the event is to connect previously dis-
parate ontology development eﬀorts, stakeholder com-
munities, and interoperability initiatives with shared
objectives. Aside from sharing knowledge, expertise,
and best practices, our goal is to build-out existing on-
tology resources in a hands-on manner in terms of on-
tological rigor, semantic richness, and modularity that
supports eﬀective reuse.
We also plan to have programming expertise and ac-
tivities present at the event, such as for necessary
large-scale transformations, and especially for proof-of-
concept applications that directly apply the ontologies
being developed.
On a long-term basis, we anticipate that the
event, if successful, will give rise to similarly struc-
tured follow-up events organized by the partici-
pating stakeholder communities, such as TDWG,
SONet ( http://sonet.ecoinformatics.org ), and OBO
(http://www.obofoundry.org).
ORGANIZATION
The VoCamp will be 4 days in duration during Novem-ber 7-11, 2009 and is co-located with the TDWG annual
conference ( http://www.tdwg.org/conference2009 ) in
Montpellier, France. The ﬁrst two days (Nov 7-8) will
be dedicated entirely to VoCamp and the remainder of
the event (Nov 10-11) will overlap with TDWG ’work-
shops days’. Participants will have the opportunity, and
are encouraged, to interact with TDWG participants
and attend conference sessions outside of the VoCamp.
The speciﬁc vocabulary development targets will be se-
lected by the participants partly in advance through a
dedicated area on a wiki, a mailing list, and one or more
conference calls, and partly on-site through an Open
Space activity. The exact agenda for the event will be
developed similarly, but will be largely devoted to ontol-
ogy and vocabulary development time. At the event it-
self, participants will self-organize into small subgroups
focused on particular targets. The VoCamp will con-
clude with a wrap-up session, and a report presented
to the TDWG conference audience.
We also anticipate that several “boot camps” will be
needed to ensure a productive event for all participants,
for example on ontology design and engineering, reason-
ing, and infrastructure for collaborative development of
ontologies.
We welcome comments and suggestions for issues in
ontology development that are not explicitly addressed
here or in our proposal but that could be addressed
at the event. Please email the organizers at vo-
camp1@nescent.org with any suggestions.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
