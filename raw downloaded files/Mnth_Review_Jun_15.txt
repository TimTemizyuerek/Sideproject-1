Submit abstracts by June 5th for a day-long symposium
on \What complex systems theory oers to evolution-
ary medicine" as a part of the Conference on Complex
Systems the rst meeting in the USA for the European
Conferences on Complex Systems (ECCS) .
http://www.ccs2015.org/ Limited travel support is
available.
WHAT COMPLEX SYSTEMS THEORY OFFERS TO
EVOLUTIONARY MEDICINE
| Symposium Overview |Applications of evolutionary biology in medicine are
growing fast but are only now incorporating advances
in the analysis of complex systems. The range of ap-
plications is wide. Gene networks are characterized
by complexity vastly dierent from that of designed
systems, resulting in both robustness and special vul-
nerability. Complex networks of positive and negative
feedback loops regulate genomic, cellular and physiolog-
ical systems whose disruption results in disease that can
manifest at all these levels. Therapeutic interventions
can disrupt these networks in ways that can be useful,
but that can also result in additional risks that require
understanding in complex systems terms. Within the
broader context of medicine, systems of medical care
organization evolve and grow as well, creating sudden
transitions that can undermine the quality of patient
care. We anticipate that the call for abstracts for thisJune 1, 2015 EvolDir 3
symposium should bring proposals from many scientists
working on related problems who will, in the course of
this symposium, create new connection and collabora-
tions. The talks by those scientists will be integrated
with talks by the organizers .
Abstracts are welcome on all topics at the interface of
evolution, medicine, and complexity, but we especially
seek contributions on topics related to regulation of gene
expression, cellular functions, and physiological systems.

will be focused on testing hands-on, data-driven modules
in the undergraduate classroom. Funding is available to
support participants' attendance at ESA.
Dates & Location: Sunday, August 9 from 9AM-4:30PM
at the Ecological Society of America Annual Meeting in
Baltimore, Maryland.
Description: DryadLab is seeking faculty to eld test
classroom modules during the Fall of 2015. DryadLab
is an educational extension of the Dryad Digital Reposi-
tory, which contains freely available research data from
thousands of published scientic papers. DryadLab
provides open, high-quality, hands-on, data-driven ed-
ucational modules suitable for use in undergraduate
classrooms, developed by the authors of the original
publications in collaboration with experienced educa-
tors.
DryadLab is joining forces with the Quantitative Under-
graduate Biology Education Synthesis (QUBES) project
to provide support for eld testers via an online network
that will facilitate the sharing of resources and expertise.
The network will run from 20 July 2015 to 20 November
2015 and will be hosted online at https://qubeshub.org/ .
Prior to the ESA kick-o meeting, participants will have
the opportunity to review materials for four DryadLab
modules:
1. Introduction to Extinction and Extinction Bias
2. Survivorship in the Natural World
3. A Walk Through the Woods: Data Analysis of Struc-
tural Adaptations in Wood
4. The Beetle Aair
Module descriptions are available at: https:/-

dryadlab module descriptions During the one-day
kick-o, participants will develop a plan for integrating
the DryadLab modules into their existing course
curriculum. After the in-person meeting, network
participants will continue to interact online to rene
the modules for their classroom, discuss various
implementation challenges, and dene strategies to
overcome these challenges. Participants will implement
these modules in their classroom during the fall and6 EvolDir June 1, 2015

INSECT GENETIC TECHNOLOGY workshop
June 17, 2015 (Wednesday morning and afternoon)
Robust protocols to manipulate genes and genomes
have not yet been developed for most insects other
than Drosophila melanogaster, and this shortfall is lim-
iting research progress in many aspects of arthropod
genomics. The NSF-RCN on Insect Genetic Technolo-
gies (IGTRCN: 2014-2019; igtrcn.org) seeks to remedy
this problem by facilitating the communication of best
practice and new techniques among arthropod genomi-
cists.
This IGTRCN-sponsored workshop will comprise (1)
talks that showcase the latest genetic technologies, (2)
discussion sessions for exchange of ideas and solutions
for eective insect genetic engineering, and (3) posters.
Proposals from the workshop will be integrated into
the IGTRCN program of hands-on practical workshops,
fellowships, and the IGTRCN KnowledgeBase. Early-
career researchers are particularly encouraged to present
their research at this workshop. A limited number
of travel grants to attend the workshop are available
for early stage investigators. Application deadline was
March 9. For more information on poster abstract and
travel grant submission for the workshop, go to

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 30TH APRIL
2015
Dear colleagues,
As you already know the XV European Congress of
Ichthyology, organized by the Interdisciplinary Centre
of Marine and Environmental Research, will take place
from the 7th to 11th September 2015 in Porto Portu-
gal. This is an international congress promoted by the
European Ichthyological Societythat has been held on
a three-year cycle since 1973. Recent meetings have
been able to attract around 250-300 researchers from
around the world. The congress will focus on sh as a
subject of research in several biological sciences. The
scientic program will include sessions following four
main topics: I) Phylogeny, systematic and genetics; II)
Ecology, conservation and invasive species; III) Life cy-
cles, migration and connectivity; and IV) Physiology,
behaviour and toxicology. Two special symposia have
also been organized: V) Otoliths as a powerful tool to
study shes; and VI) Mediterranean sh biodiversity.
The congress will be organized with parallel oral sessions
and poster exhibitions. The congress will include several
invited plenary lectures made by world renowned sh
researchers: Drs. Jerey Leis (Australia), Joana Robalo
(Portugal), Kenneth Able (USA), Marino Vachhi (Italy),
Miguel Pineda(Spain), Neil Metcalfe (UK), Rui Oliveira
(Portugal) and Steven Campana (Canada).
The abstract submission deadline is fast approaching on
the 30th of April 2015. It is mandatory to register rst
to access the on-line submission form. However, you
do not need to pay until the early and late registration
dates on the 15th and 30th of June 2015, respectively.
The registration feeshave been kept low to attract as
much as possible early career researchers (250 euro) and
graduate students (150 euro). Members of the EIS have
a 20% discount. Students will also have the opportu-
nity to compete for awards for best oral and poster
presentations.
The congress will be held at the Hotel HF Ipanema
Park, a 5 stars hotel. A complete buet lunch, includ-
ing water, juices and wines, is available in the conference
hotel for 15 euro per day, but to a limited number ofJune 1, 2015 EvolDir 9
persons. However, within short walking distance (less
than 5 minutes) you have other light and inexpensive
options, such as a Japanese restaurant, a Pizzeria and
a few snack-bars.
Please also check out the organized social program. We
have schedule events for each conference day for both
participants and accompanying persons. Some of them
are free, but you will need to book them through the
online registration.
In 2014 Porto was elected the best Eu-
ropean destination by European citizens
(www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/europe-
best-destinations-2014/), and I am sure that you will
be delighted with the city, people and food (and of
course Port wine). Our international airport is served
by several regular and low-cost airlines companies.
But train and car are other options. Bookings for
accommodation with special prices for other HF Hotels
are also now open. Some low-cost accommodations
are now also available on the webpage. We strongly
recommend \Casa Diocesana Semin ario do Vilar" with
single and double rooms ranging from 25 to 39 euro per
day with breakfast included. September is still part
of the summer season for tourism in Porto so try to
reserve your accommodation in advance. If you need
any help, feel free to contact us.
Further, and regularly, updated information can be
found at the congress webpage (www.ciimar.up.pt/-
ecixv). Please follow our latest news onFace-
book (www.facebook.com/ECIXV) and Twitter
(www.twitter.com/ECI XV).
We would greatly appreciate if you kindly forward this
information to your colleagues and students in your
University, Institute and/or national and international
networks. Please also accept our apologies for cross-
postings.
We hope to see you in Porto in early September.

ZHAW symposium 2015: \Life in Numbers 2: Genomics
and Evolution of Microbial Pathogens"
Date: 1 September 2015 Place: W adenswil (Z urich
lake), Switzerland Organizers: Maria Anisimova and
Theo Smits
Summary:With>28'000 microbial genomes sequenced today, a
broader range of researchers can step into NGS genomics
without the prior knowledge of the complexity involved.
This one-day conference is organised in two sections:
\Genomics in practice" and \Evolutionary genomics";
with the aim to promote the dialogue between the com-
munity of microbiologists interested in genome analyses
and their practical applications (e.g., in medicine or agri-
culture) and the community of bioinformatics method
developers. During this conference the microbiology
community will be able to bring their practical prob-
lems to the attention of method developers, prompting
the exchange of ideas and leading to new methodolo-
gies and applications. The conference will facilitate the
translation of academic results in pathogen genomics
and bioinformatics to solving practical problems in mi-
crobiology.
The conference is in line with the current strategy of
ZHAW to expand applied genomics and bioinformatics
research and its visibility in this eld. The event will
take place during the joint ZHAW-SIB summer school
GEMP2015 (on a similar topic), and its participants
will also attend the conference and will benet from the
invited talks and research discussions.

The aim of this conference is to bring together re-
searchers and organisations from a range of disci-
plines with shared interests in the development of newapproaches for data handling, generation and analy-
sis in environmental omics. Science areas of inter-
est include bioinformatics, DNA-barcoding, genomics,
metagenomics, metabarcoding, transcriptomics, pro-
teomics, metabolomics, epigenetics, evolutionary and
ecological omics, phylogenetics, study of ancient DNA
and anthropology, new tools, resources and training,
and beyond as applied to the study of the natural envi-
ronmental and environmentally relevant organisms and
systems. It is our hope is that the resulting interaction
and exchange of ideas will lead to novel approaches,
new collaborations and the consolidation of a wider
integrated environmental omics community.
EOS and this conference is supported by Natural Envi-
ronmental Research Council (NERC) through its Math-

PhD Position \Evolutionary Genetics of the Embryo
Mortality Puzzle in the Zebra Finch" at the Max Planck
Institute for Ornithology
A PhD position is available at the Max Planck Institute
for Ornithology (MPIO) in Seewiesen (near Munich,
Germany) to study the quantitative and molecular ge-
netics of embryo mortality in zebra nches.
It is one of the most fundamental puzzles in evolutionary
biology why many animal species show high rates of re-
productive failure despite the fact that natural selection
should be acting against this in every single generation.
For instance, in humans, it is estimated that two out
of three fertilized eggs die before birth, and it is still
not understood why such a wasteful system has evolved.
The case of the zebra nch also represents such a puz-
zle, because we see high rates of embryo mortality that
cannot be attributed to trivial phenomena like environ-
mental eects or inbreeding. The project will combine
the use of various genomic tools and QTL mapping
with setting up specic experimental crosses to identify
and characterize the genetic factors that lead to embryo
mortality. In particular, we will attempt to understand
better the evolution of incompatibility-causing loci and
of selsh genetic elements.
We seek a highly motivated individual who shares our
fascination with this topic and who has a background
or strong interest in some of the following elds: evo-
lutionary biology, quantitative genetics, molecular ge-
netics and statistics. A Master's degree in biology or
equivalent is required. The project primarily involves
handling of extensive data sets of phenotypic and ge-
netic data (breeding records of egg fates, pedigrees,
SNPs, microsatellites, sequence data). Any prior knowl-
edge in using R or Python or any experience in using
bioinformatics tools in a Linux environment would be
advantageous but can also be acquired at a later stage.
Initial appointment will be for three years with a possible
extension for another year subject to research progress.
Payment will be through a Max Planck PhD position
(13/2 TV oD). We provide a supportive research and
learning environment with excellent facilities. Working
language is English. The Max Planck Society is an equal
opportunity employer and encourages disabled personsJune 1, 2015 EvolDir 19
to apply. The Society aims at increasing the number of
women in elds where they are underrepresented, and
therefore encourages them to apply.
Please send your application by June 1st 2015
as a single le to our secretary Carmen Dobus
(cdobus@orn.mpg.de). This le should include a concise
statement of research interests and work experiences
relevant to the project, curriculum vitae and contact
details for 2-3 academic references.

MemorialU WildlifeEvolution
Ecology and Sociobiology of a Wolf-Ungulate Predator-
Prey Game
Start Date: September 2015 (exibility exists for excep-
tional candidates) We have a fully funded PhD position
for a student interested studying the spatial ecology
and sociobiology of predator-prey dynamics with links
to population and disease ecology in a wolf-ungulate
community.
System: Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP) in
Manitoba is among the best-studied large mammal com-
munities in Canada. Peer-reviewed research has been
produced from the RMNP system for the last 80 years:
from Green (1933) and Baneld (1949) to Paquet (1990s)
and our recent work. RMNP is a rich system within
which to simultaneously ask fundamental and applied
ecological and evolutionary questions. Over the com-
ing years and primarily using GPS collars, this project
will see all wolf packs and >80% of the elk monitored
in one of RMNPs elk subpopulations, creating a near-
perfect spatial and temporal picture of predatory-prey
interactions between wolves and their primary prey.
Furthermore, the successful applicant will have access
to our considerable collection of historical individual-
and population-level data on space use and population
densities of elk, moose, white-tailed deer and wolves
(see our papers for examples). As a result, this project
will provide excellent opportunities for both academic
and professional advancement. Because it is a PhD-
level project, the successful applicant will be expected
to develop her or his own ideas and research plan in
collaboration with the research team.
In the Wildlife Evolutionary Ecology Lab we feel
strongly that novel biological ideas are derived from
interacting directly with our study species and system,
and the successful applicant will be expected to spend
considerable amounts of time in the eld, supported by
an excellent team of biologists at RMNP. The successful
applicant will be required to actively investigate kill-
and den-sites and to y telemetry, while simultaneously
working with existing data. At the PhD level, this will
require an exceptional applicant who can both be in
the eld and continue to actively analyze and write
throughout their program.
Qualications: In addition to a MSc that complements20 EvolDir June 1, 2015
this research, applicants should have ve main qualities:
(1) a passion for ecological and evolutionary theory; (2)
an aptitude for and commitment to research in the eld
V in all seasons; (3) well-developed quantitative skills
in GIS, statistical programing in R, and experience or
an interest in modeling; (4) a track-record of publishing
their research in reputable peer-reviewed journals; (5)
and foremost, evidence of collegiality.
Team: This research is part of a larger collaborative
program studying predatory-prey dynamics in wolf-
ungulate systems in southern Manitoba. As a result the
successful applicant will be a part of a research team
that includes Parks Canada biologists, Manitoba Fish
and Wildlife ecologists, a MSc student in RMNP (start
date May 2016), and another PhD student studying
wolf-ungulate dynamics in eastern MB. This collabo-
rative opportunity will permit the right applicant to
participate in projects and publications in addition to
their own core research.
Wildlife Evolutionary Ecology Lab (http://-
ericvanderwal.weebly.com/): We are a question-driven
research group; one of a number of productive and
dynamic research groups in ecology, evolution, and
animal behavior at MUN. We bridge fundamental
and applied questions in evolutionary, behavioral,
population, and wildlife ecology, particularly with social
ungulates. RMNP has been one of our keystone and
must productive research systems and this new program
aims to further advance our work on density-dependent
resource and space use, social and group dynamics of
ungulates now with a ner-scale understanding of the
predatory-prey game.
To apply please send a letter of interest, CV, and tran-
scripts (unocial) to eric.vanderwal@mun.ca. Although
the position is fully funded, students will be encouraged
to compete for internal and external funding; higher
GPAs and a history of publications improves compet-
itiveness. The competition will remain open until the
position is lled.

Summary of the PhD proposal How populations will
adapt to the ongoing climate change is becoming a chal-
lenging question. This is particularly relevant for pre-
dominantly selng species, because theoretical models
predict that selng increases homozygocity and reduces
the eective populationsize, which in return aects the
eciency of selection and can reduce the adaptive po-
tential of populations. In this PhD project, we propose
to combine methodological developments with an exper-
imental approach. The experimental approach will aim
at testing whether three populations of Medicago trun-
catula, a predominantly selng Mediterranean species,
have adapted to climate change by shifting their ower-
ing time across the past 25 years. The methodological
part intends to developa tool to detect a signature of
selection using temporal dataadapted to highly selng
organisms. This tool will be tested using genetic data
from the three M. truncacula populations to identify
the genetic architecture of the hypothetical change in
phenology. More generally, this work will allow mak-
ing recommendations about the choice of a method toJune 1, 2015 EvolDir 21
detect signatures of selection when studying time se-
ries of genetic data and will suggest solutions to reduce
the limitations usually imposed bydeviationsfromthe
hypothesis of panmixis.

Two PhD positions in biodiversity-ecosystem function-
ing and multitrophic interactions at the University of
Bern
Applications are invited for two, PhD positions work-
ing with Prof. Eric Allan, at the University of Bern in
Switzerland.
Nitrogen enrichment is a key global change driver in
grasslands which impacts ecosystem functioning through
a range of direct and indirect eects. The project aims
to experimentally disentangle some of these mechanisms,
including looking at eects of biodiversity loss along-
side changes in plant functional composition and foliar
fungal pathogen abundance. We also aim to test the
eects of global change on pathogen communities, theo-
ries about when pathogens have their largest top down
eects on plant communities and to explore the host
range of fungal pathogens with further experiments.
The two PhD students will set up, and work on, a large
grassland eld experiment near the city of Bern. One
PhD student will focus more on ecosystem functioning
(including quantifying measures of nitrogen and car-
bon cycling and litter decomposition) and the other on
responses and eects of pathogens.
We are seeking highly motivated applicants interested
in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning, plant community
ecology and multitrophic interactions. Applicants must
hold (or shortly complete) a Master degree or equiv-
alent in biology or another relevant discipline, with a
good background in ecology. Some previous research
experience in ecology and good statistical knowledge
are desirable. Strong oral and written communication
skills in English are required. The positions will be
based at the Institute of Plant Sciences in Bern, which
oers a stimulating, international research environment

to research the eects of environmental change on phy-
toplankton communities with Dr. Etienne Low-D ecarie
with the co- supervision of Professor Richard Geider in
the School of Biological Sciences of the University of

The PhD student will investigate how phytoplankton
communities change in response to changes in their en-
vironment. Phytoplankton are responsible for half of
the biological uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere and
are the base of most aquatic food webs. In addition,
as they are small and grow rapidly, they are perfect
model organisms from which inferences can be made for
the response to global change of other primary produc-

phytoplankton, including strains that have evolved un-

generations.

The Jackson group is broadly interested in the molecular
processes by which metazoans have evolved the ability
to form mineralised body parts. We are currently devel-
oping the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis as a model
organism with which to address these questions. We
are developing a range of modern molecular techniques
and have established extensive sequence datasets for
this research on Lymnaea. With these modern resources
it is envisaged that the PhD candidate would marry
the wealth of histological knowledge of shell molluscan
formation that exists in the classical literature with in-
sights mined from our modern resources. The position
would therefore be well suited to an individual with
some molecular biology skills and/or familiarity with
the analysis of large computational datasets such as
RNASeq and whole genome data.
Candidates should hold a master degree with a major
in either evolution, developmental biology, molecular
biology, or a related eld. In addition to their academic
qualications, candidates should have excellent commu-
nication and team-working skills, be committed to the
topic and to working in a dedicated, interdisciplinary re-
search environment. The working language of the group
is English, and applicants from abroad are encouraged
to apply.
The University of G ottingen seeks to increase the par-
ticipation of women in areas in which they are currently
under represented and therefore explicitly urges women
to apply. Disabled persons with equivalent aptitude will
be favoured.
Applications, in English, must include:
1. A full academic CV including a list of all published
or unpublished academic work. 2. A 1-2 page summary

Evolutionary transition between hermaphroditism and
separate sexes
Application deadline: 25 May 2015
Sex is a central topic in biology and it is often asso-
ciated to male and female genders. But why males
and females are so common in animals? And if there
has been some selective advantage in evolving male
and female genders, why is hermaphroditism almost
ubiquitous among animal taxa and why are there more
than 65000 species of hermaphroditic species in animals?
Have males and females evolved from hermaphrodites
or vice versa? Whereas other questions in the evolution
of sex have been the focus of theoretical and empirical
research in animals (e.g., sexual selection, the transition
between sexual and asexual reproduction, etc.), the tran-
sition between hermaphroditism and separate sexes has
been rarely explored and we are left with many unsolved
questions. This PhD project plan to meet this goal us-
ing polychaete worms of the genus Ophryotrocha as
biological models and testing the role of hermaphrodite
behavioral traits (such as reciprocity and plastic sex
allocation) and gonochoric behavioral traits (such as
gender specialization) in stabilizing hermaphroditism
and/or favoring the transition towards separate sexes.
The project requires doing behavioral experiments where
worms are exposed to dierent conditions (e.g., density
and/or mate competition) and/or used in choice tests;
data on their mating behavior and mate preferences as
well as measures of their reproductive investment will
be analysed. Most experiments require working at the
stereomicroscope.

\The evolution of trade-os in mating behaviour and
physiology" University of Plymouth, UK School of Bio-
logical Sciences Applications are invited for a three-year
PhD studentship, fully funded for EU/UK students.
The studentship will start on October 1st 2015.
Supervisors: Dr Michael Thom (University of Plymouth)
Dr Mark Bria (Plymouth) Prof. Calvin Dytham (Uni-
versity of York) Prof. Helen White-Cooper (University
of Cardi)
Summary: For male animals, successful reproduction
involves a number of key processes including mate
searching, courtship, copulation, and sperm competi-
tion. Many of these are energetically expensive, time-
consuming, or otherwise incompatible and as a result
males are unlikely to be able to maximise performance
in all of them simultaneously. How males value the
dierent processes will depend on both physical and
social environment, with males expected to plastically
adjust their relative investment in each to maximise
their reproductive success under prevailing conditions.
Using the model species Drosophila melanogaster, thisproject will explore how these dierent components of
the male reproductive process are traded o under si-
multaneous variation in biotic (e.g. population density,
sex ratio) and abiotic (e.g. nutritional composition, food
distribution) conditions. The student will be based at
Plymouth, but will conduct histological work on the
rate and delity of spermatogenesis with Prof. Helen
White-Cooper at Cardi. In addition to the empirical
studies on behaviour and sperm production, the student
will have the opportunity to learn the programming lan-
guage C++, and will use this to develop an agent-based
model exploring the evolution of ecological plasticity in
mating behaviour and physiology - this will be overseen
by Prof. Calvin Dytham at York.

ther informally, please contact Dr Thom on

Project title: Pollination competition and facilitation
as ecological driver of oral diversity and evolution in
Mediterranean Linum (Linaceae)
Most plants in communities tent to interact indirectly
by sharing pollinators, and these interactions can bring
positive or negative eects to plant tness. At commu-
nity level, most of the research has focused on whether
sharing pollinators is benecial or costly for plants. This
is surprising because the sign and net eect of the inter-
action is context dependent. For example, adjustments
in owering phenology of species can support the polli-
nator community during the entire blooming season and
increase the residence time of pollinators. In contrast,
co-owering species can compete for the pollinator ser-
vice, and the strength of these negative interactions may
be a density dependent process in a spatially explicit
context. All these processes are not mutually exclusive,
and they vary temporally and spatially; in the longer
term, they can structure species composition and com-30 EvolDir June 1, 2015
binations of dierent oral traits. This PhD project
will (i) evaluate how facilitation and competition for
pollinator service can structure plant communities by
looking at (ii) rates of intra-specic pollen ow and
inter-specic pollen ow to (iii) quantify the selective
value of these complex interactions as drivers of oral
evolution, speciation and dierentiation of traits directly
linked with female and male tness.
The research will be conducted in Mediterranean commu-
nities of ax species (Linum, Linaceae) in Spain, where
often several species coower and share pollinators.
We are looking for enthusiastic, independent and dy-
namic candidates with strong interest in plant-animal
interactions. Candidates must have a good Master's
degree, or good degree in Biology or Environmental
Biology, with a background in Plant Population Biology,
Ecology and Evolution. The candidate should be famil-
iar with the package R for data analysis of ecological
and molecular data, and exible to work in a team and
independently. It is expected that (s)he will be an active
part of preparation of grant proposal and manuscripts.
The candidate will gain skills both in the eld and the
lab. The eldwork will be conducted in Spain, and it
would be benecial for the candidate to speak Spanish.
The lab work and greenhouse experiments will be con-
ducted in the facilities of The University of Portsmouth.
In addition the candidate will have access to the Grad-
uate School Development Programme and Department

ANNOTATION
Full time permanent position. The position is available
as soon as possible. 6 months trial period.
Uppsala University is an international research univer-
sity focused on the development of science and education.
Our most important assets are all the individuals who
with their curiosity and their dedication makes Uppsala
University one of Sweden's most exciting work places.
Uppsala University has 45.000 students, 6,800 employees
and a turnover of SEK 6,300 million.
Bioinformatics Infrastructure for Life Sciences (BILS;
http://bils.se) is furthering life science research in Swe-
den by providing support in the eld of bioinformat-
ics. Over 45 experts are currently employed at mul-
tiple sites in Sweden, supporting projects in a wide
array of areas such as genomics, transcriptomics, pro-
teomics, metabolomics, statistics, and more. BILS
is working closely together with SciLifeLab (http://-
www.scilifelab.se), a national resource that facilitates re-
search in molecular biosciences by providing access to ad-
vanced technologies and technical know-how. Through
recent acquisitions, SciLifeLab is now the third largest
sequencing center in Europe. The large amount of re-
sources available makes Sweden one of the best countries
in the world to perform life science research, and to-
gether with talented Swedish researchers this has placed
Sweden at the forefront of elds such as comparative
genomics and genome evolution.
BILS is now looking for a new member to the genome as-
sembly and annotation team to work with in particular
annotation of eukaryote genomes. The team is placed
at Uppsala University in the creative environment of
the SciLifeLab Uppsala node \The Hub" where more
than 20 bioinformaticians as well as core facilities and
many dierent research groups are interacting. The
team is working in close collaboration with Swedish re-
search groups to supply genome assemblies and genome
annotations of a high international standard.
Job description: We are looking for an expert with a
strong background in NGS bioinformatics and an in-
terest in genome annotation. The work will involve
helping Swedish genome annotation projects with any-thing from providing guidance in the setup and running
of annotation projects to completely running the whole
annotation process for the customer. The projects will
dier in complexity from quick-running jobs of a few
days to longer projects of several months and can focus
on any type of organism, but mostly eukaryotes. A
familiarity with scripting and automation of procedures
in a Linux environment is of importance, as the work
also will involve the maintenance and improvement of
existing pipelines and methods.
Qualications: We seek a candidate with a PhD in
bioinformatics, molecular biology, computer science or
any related eld with a strong competence in genome
annotation or a related eld such as transcriptomics. Ex-
perience from large eukaryote genome projects is valued
highly. Prociency in one or more scripting languages
(e.g. Perl, Python, Ruby) is a necessity, with experi-
ence in Ensembl-API or Ensembl-Hive considered extra
benecial. The ability to drive projects and work in
a collaborative, yet service-minded environment is a
must. Excellent communication skills in both written
and spoken English are required, since the candidate will
collaborate with scientists of very dierent backgrounds.
Emphasis will be placed on personal suitability for the
position.
Information: For questions regarding BILS, please check
out our website at http://www.bils.se or contact the
director of BILS, Bengt Persson (bengt.persson@bils.se).

AnimalExpt Petition
Dear EvolDir community,
We all do science and we know that our work is impor-
tant for nding out new things that continously change
and shape human society. More discoveries lead to more
insight. Animal experimentation has undoubtedly be-
come a heavily critisised discipline but also here a lot of
progress has been made. Both in the results emerging
from the research, but also in avoiding animal experi-
ments. However, there are experiments that cannot be
avoided, and these have high priority in some research
lines. It is good to lead a lively discussion about the
need about each animal experiment, but somtimes these
discussions go too far. In short, we have seen a case of
an esteemed neuroscience researcher (Nikos Logothetis)
with a research agenda on non-human primate brains
has been thretened to such an extent as to annouce to
drop his research altogether. If you like, please read a
longer version here: http://www.cin.uni-tuebingen.de/-
sign-open-letter.php . It is an open letter in support of
this type of research, which you can sign if you like.
Thanks for your consideration.

ASN Awards RegionalMeetings
**Deadline Reminder - May 10th**
ASN Awards for Support of Regional Meetings in Ecol-
ogy, Evolution and Behavior
The American Society of Naturalists solicits proposals
from organizers of regional meetings in the elds of
ecology, evolution and behavior. The purpose of these
small awards is to promote increased participation in
regional meetings that fall along the research interests
supported by the ASN and to use this support as a
way of recruiting new membership to ASN. The awards
typically provide subsidized registration for ASN mem-
bers at these regional meetings. Organizers of regional
meetings should submit a one-page proposal describing
the research focus of the meeting for which funds are
requested as well as details of the meeting such as antic-
ipated number of participants, meeting venue and dates.Please also include a brief budget justifying the amount
requested. We anticipate funding 3-5 awards and award
amounts are usually between $1000-$1500.
Please send proposals to the ASN Regional Soci-
ety Liaison Committee Chair Renee Duckworth at
rad3@email.arizona.edu by May 10th.

Brazil Visa
Hey U.S. people going to Brazil for Evolution 2015: DO
YOUR VISA NOW. IT'S A HUGE PAIN, at least for
those of us that haven't been to Brazil before. And
it will take POSSIBLY 15 BUSINESS DAYS PLUS
MAILING TIME ETC.
Before too much griping, note that the aforementioned
pain exists only because the U.S. does the same thing
to Brazilians. So it won't be easier until there is some
mutual agreement reached between the governments.
Since I blew half the day guring it out, I will post the
list of documents and basic procedure below. Of course
you are responsible for your own decisions and I might
have something wrong, I am not a lawyer, yadda yadda.
GOAL: US citizens need a tourist visa for Brazil. They
need approval stamped ON THEIR PASSPORT before
they leave the U.S.
TIME: The Atlanta Consulate says processing time is
15 business days (!). In other words, DO IT NOW.
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, which you will mail to the
closest Brazilian consulate in the U.S. (unless you make
an appointment at a consulate in person)
===1. U.S. passport. Yes, you will MAIL your pre-
cious passport to the consulate, they will stamp it and
mail it back. No, this isn't tremendously clear in the
instructions. The passport must:
1a. be signed (make sure you sign it) 1b. have at least
6 months left on it from the time you enter Brazil 1c.
have at least 2 blank pages 1d. You should scan / copy /
iPhone photo your passport for backup before you mail
it o
2. Plane tickets with ticket numbers for entry and exit-
ing Brazil.
3. The invitation letter from the Evolution 2015 meet-
ing, which you can get as a PDF after you register,
by logging into http://evolution2015.org/ 4. A recentJune 1, 2015 EvolDir 45
passport-type photo with a neutral expression. No glare,
so take your glasses o. I got two at Walgreens for $12.
5. Fill out the online visa application, then print it out,
then (a) glue on the passport photo, (b) sign it, and (c)
also hand-write Contact Person and their phone number
handwritten.
The online application asks for a bunch of information
including:
- passport number etc. - hotel. The conference hotel is:
Casa Grande Hotel Resort & Spa Telefone (Phone #): 55
13 3389-4000 Av Miguel St efano, 1001 - CEP: 11440-530.
Enseada Guaruj a/SP - Brasil Tel.: (55 13) 3389.4000.
Fax.: (55 13) 3389.4023 www.casagrandehotel.com.br/-
en/ hotel@casagrandehotel.com.br
(notes: SP = the state of S ~A$o Paulo; CEP is I think
the equivalent of zip code)
6. Recent bank statement showing \sucient funds"
to be a tourist. Your guess is as good as mine what
that means, I am just printing out my checking account
statement showing I have slightly more than $0.
7. You have to pay US$160.00, *not* with a check, but
*only* with a U.S. Postal Service Money Order made out
to \Consulate of Brasil". Make sure to write your name
on the money order. http://atlanta.itamaraty.gov.br/-
en-us/payment options.xml Note: The U.S. Post Oce
ONLY takes ATM/Debit, or cash, for Money Orders.
No credit cards, no checks.
8. I am throwing in my hotel reservation and the extra
passport photo because, why the heck not.
9. Pre-stamped, pre-addressed return envelope, with
USPS tracking number. At the Post Oce I got USPS
Priority Mail each way, this comes with tracking num-
bers and $50 insurance., about $7 each way.
Take the above stack of documents to the Post Oce,
and mail them to the local consulate with a USPS track-
ing number.
=== INSTRUCTIONS PAGES { the relevant info is
spread over many pages. The best pages seem to be
those *for the specic consulate that serves your region*,
since there are dierences between consulates.
I recommend printing out all of these pages, reading
them, and taking them to the Post Oce in case ques-
tions come up. The most important thing is the address
of the consulate. These were for the Atlanta, GA con-
sulate, yours might be dierent and might have dierent
instructions:

ESEB equal opportunities
committee
^A We are seeking Evolutionary Biologists for the newly
founded equal opportunities committee of the ESEB.
Why an equal opportunities committee? The represen-
tation of women in academia remains low in most elds
in science and engineering, despite near equal gender ra-
tios at graduation. The problem is often phrased as the
\Leaky Pipeline" problem, which describes the attrition
of women from science at various stages along the aca-
demic career trajectory. Among the many contributing
factors are unconscious biases that we have about the
ability of men and women to perform a given scientic
task.
For example, a recent study found that fewer women
give invited talks at the ESEB congress than might
be expected. As a consequence, ESEB audiences are
exposed to fewer top quality female speakers than are
available, which reinforces gender stereotypes. Further-
more, ESEB student members experience fewer female
role models than they could; this may demotivate young
women to pursue an academic career in our eld. Sim-
ilar problems exist for other underrepresented groups
(for example, ethnicities).
The ESEB Equal Opportunities committee will target
these and similar problems.
Our aims are to: 1) to ensure equal opportunities in all
activities and facets of ESEB 2) to increase awareness of
the problem of underrepresented groups 3) to produce
\best practice guidelines" for both ESEB as a society,
the congress, and the journal 4) to monitor status and
progress of underrepresented groups in our society and
eld46 EvolDir June 1, 2015
The committee has a budget and an important task of
committee members is to review applications and decide
how to best spend our budget. The committee members
will also work on guidelines and on monitoring.
We are hoping to create a diverse committee with people
who can bring diverse points of view and experience.
If you have experience with improving participation of
underrepresented groups, you are especially welcome to
apply.
If you are interested to bring yourself in and work for-
ward to these goals as a committee member, please send
an email with a very brief description of how you would
like to help to
julia.schroeder@gmail.com and pspennings@gmail.com
Deadline is 20.05.2015
If you are interested to apply for money to improve
participation of underrepresented groups, we'd be inter-
ested to hear from you too, although we need to form a
committee before we post a formal call for proposals.

FuturePhy Phylogenetics
Conferences Workshops
*Announcement: FuturePhy Conferences and Work-
shops on Phylogenetics*
FuturePhy is an NSF-sponsored, three-year program of
conferences, workshops and hackathons on the Tree of
Life. The project aims to promote novel, integrative
data analyses and visualization, interdisciplinary syn-
theses of phylogenetic sciences, and cross-cutting uses
of phylogenetics to develop and address new research
questions and applications.
The rst phase of this mission is critical: to bring to-
gether a broad community of people from diverse back-
grounds who are active in phylogenetics research, who
use the tree of life in research or education, who will ben-
et in applied or practical ways from a comprehensive
tree of life, or who come from a background that oers
new perspectives on dening, addressing or transcending
key challenges in phylogenetics.
Help accelerate progress in all aspects of phylogenetics
research by joining FuturePhy today. Diverse opportu-
nities will be available to attend FuturePhy sessions in
person or virtually, and to link FuturePhy to existing
projects and initiatives.

Math in Biology
Dear EvolDir users:
I'm a doctoral candidate in Mathematics Education at
the University of Texas, Austin, conducting a study on
biologists use of math to identify the main mathematical
and statistical tools currently used in the eld. The re-
sults of the study would help to inform the graduate and48 EvolDir June 1, 2015
undergraduate curriculum in Biology and Mathematic-
sXas well as the curriculum of related training programs
outside of academiaXso that they would better align to
student needs at their future workplace.
The rst part of the study consists of an online survey
designed for biologists (from the areas of ecology, evolu-
tion, and behavior and developmental biology) that was
piloted by faculty members and students at UT Austin,
and has an average completion time of 9 minutes. I am
emailing to ask for your participation in the survey.
I can oer no compensation but I would be happy to
share the results of the study, and make you eligible to
win one of four $25 Amazon gift cardsXI know is not
really not much, I am limited to a very small budget.

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
I have just uploaded a new version of DAMBE. The
main news is that (distance-based method + pairwise
alignment) performs much better than (maximum like-
lihood method + multiple alignment) based on exten-
sive sequence simulations of amino acid, codon and
nucleotide sequences of increasing sequence divergence.
The dierence in performance disappears only when
sequences are easily aligned or when sequences expe-50 EvolDir June 1, 2015
rienced full substitution saturation (when no method
can recover any true tree or subtrees). The function
for (distance-based method + pairwise alignment) can
be accessed by clicking 'Phylogenetics jDistance-based
methodsjPhylogenetics with pairwise alignment'.
If you wish to compare the performance by doing simu-
lation yourself, here are the associated functions:
1. Do sequence simulation with indels, and save the
resulting unaligned sequences into a FASTA le (The in-
dels introduced in simulation leads to dierent sequence
lengths. Make sure that some sequences will not accu-
mulate so many deletions that only a few AA, codon or
nucleotides are left). If you take a tree with 24 OTUs
and simulate 100 sets, then the FASTA le will be
>S1 Sequence... >S2 Sequence... ... S20 Sequence...
>S1 Sequence... >S2 Sequence... ... S20 Sequence... ...
2. To use DAMBE to reconstruct 100 trees from these
100 sets of sequences, start DAMBE and click 'File jOpen
le with multiple datasets' to read in the le (You will
be asked to enter \Number of sequences per set" and
you should enter 24 if there are 24 OTUs per set of
data. This is needed because FASTA les have no in-
ternal structure to indicate the beginning and ending of
each set of sequences). In the dialogbox on what job to
perform, click 'Distance-based phylogenetics' and click
'Run'. In the following dialog boxes, just keep default
values.
3. To analyze the sequences by ML method, e.g.,
(PROML and DNAML in PHYLIP), you can use
DAMBE to do batch alignment and then save to
PHYLIP format. That is, you click 'File jOpen le with
multiple datasets' to read in the le and enter the num-
ber OTUs (e.g., 24). In the dialog box on what job to
perform, click 'Align multiple sets of sequences'. You
may use either the built-in alignment tool (ClustalW) or
use external alignment programs (I often use mat.bat).
Once the sequences are aligned, you may save them to
PHYLIP format. If you have simulated 100 sets of AA
sequences, then it is better to save the 100 sets of se-
quences into multiple les and run PROML in a parallel
fashion (otherwise it may take months). In DAMBE,
once the alignment is done, you will be presented with
the option of saving the multiple sets to one le or to
multiple les.
4. If, in your simulation of 100 sets of sequences, the
simulation program produce 100 separate les, each
with 24 sequences, then you click 'File jRead multiple
les for batch processing'. The rest is the same.
5. Once you have produced the trees in a le, e.g., out-
tree from PHYLIP, paste the \true tree" (the tree used
in simulation) into the le as the rst tree. You need toknow which methods recover more true trees/subtrees.
Click 'Phylogenetics jRobinson- Foulds analysis on trees'.
This will compare the 100 reconstructed tree against
the rst tree (the true tree).
By the way, DAMBE has a good codon alignment func-
tion that align codon sequences with a 64-by-64 score
matrix. It is quite good. If you simulate codon se-
quences, then you should align them by codon instead
of by nucleotide because aligning by codon is not only
faster (the sequences are three times shorter), but also
more accurate.
There are also a number of minor bug xes in this
release.

SSBSymposia for Evolution2016
Call for 2016 SSB Symposia
The Society for Systematic Biologists invites proposals
for symposia to be held at the 2016 SSB meeting in
Austin, Texas from June 17-21st. The meeting will be
held jointly with the American Society of Naturalists
(ASN) and the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE).
Proposals should include (1) a descriptive title, (2) one
or two paragraphs explaining the purpose of the sym-
posium and its relevance to systematics, (3) a list of
presentations including proposed speakers, their institu-
tions or aliations, and their presentation titles, and (4)
an indication of whether the speakers have been invited
and whether they have agreed to participate.
Symposia are restricted to half-day sessions (typically 6
half hour talks). The society is particularly interested
in symposia whose topics do not overlap with those
from previous meetings, that introduce new ideas or
synthesize important concepts, or those that are partic-
ularly good examples of the analysis of empirical data.
Proposals that unite systematics with other elds areJune 1, 2015 EvolDir 51
also desirable. We encourage participation from young
investigators and others typically under-represented in
symposia. Limited funding is available.
The deadline for full consideration is June 23, 2015.
Proposals should be emailed (Word or PDF for-
mat) to the Program Chairperson, Stacey D. Smith,
Stacey.D.Smith@Colorado.edu (Department of Ecology
and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado, Boul-
der, CO, 80309-0334). Please use the subject heading:
SSB Symposium Proposal.
The program chair will conrm receipt of submitted
proposals; please inquire if you do not receive email
conrmation. The proposals will be considered by the
SSB Council, and the two selected symposia will receive
funds to partially defer participant costs.

SymposiumProposals
EvolutionMeeting Austin2016
The 2016 annual meeting of the Society for the Study of
Evolution is planned for June 17-21, 2016 at the Austin
Convention Center in Austin, TX. The SSE Council in-
vites proposals for the two Society-sponsored symposia
to be held in conjunction with the meeting. Sympo-
sium proposals should include: (1) a synopsis of the
symposium theme (about one page); (2) a tentative
list of speakers, including institutional aliations, and
topics; (3) a rationale for the symposium explaining why
this topic and this group of speakers are particularly
appropriate for a Society- sponsored symposium; and
(4) a statement that all potential speakers have been
contacted and agree to participate in the symposium.
In evaluating proposals, SSE Council seriously considers
the diversity of participants as a major qualication.
Symposium organizers are expected to take into account
gender, seniority, nationality, and other aspects tra-
ditionally underrepresented in Society symposia when
preparing proposals. In addition, Council will favor
those proposals whose topics concern newly emerging
elds, elds ripe for syntheses, and elds dierent from
those that have been included in recent Society sym-
posia.
The Council will select two proposals for half-day sym-
posia at the annual meeting in June 2015. All applicants
will be notied of the Council's decision in August. The
Society provides travel support for organizers and partic-ipants in sponsored symposia. Details are available on
request. To be assured of full consideration, proposals
must be received by midnight Eastern Standard Time
on June 16, 2015.
Proposals should be sent by email
(bbrodie@virginia.edu) as a single attachment in
PDF format (under subject heading: SSE Symposia
Proposal). Please expect and request conrmation of
receipt of the proposal.

Gytis Dudas (U Edinburgh) Ebola virus epidemiology,
transmission, and viral evolution from four months of
sequencing in Sierra Leone (Analysis and Methods)
Wednesday, June 10, 2015, 9:00 AM PDT
Adding to the work reported in Gire, et al (Science, 2014)
which sequenced Ebola viruses from the rst three weeks
of the epidemic in Sierra Leone, we here present analyses
of 150 additional viral genomes sampled from EVD cases
at Kenema Government Hospital between the months
of June to September 2014. We describe continued evi-
dence for sustained human-to-human transmission with
no additional zoonotic events, and preliminary results
concerning new lineages from Guinea. We also charac-
terize the epidemiological history of the limited number
of exported viruses from the country. We also observe
a slowing of the viral substitution rate over the course
of the outbreak, consistent with the increased eect of
purifying selection as the outbreak continues over time.
These ndings allow a closer view of viral evolution dur-
ing its extended time in human populations and provide
critical insights into the movement of the virus through
the region.
This is the second talk in a pair of talks from collabo-
rators Daniel Park and Gytis Dudas concerning their
analysis of Ebola virus sequences.

Warming expt analysis
Hi folks,
As you might (or might not) know, we have for ve
years now been running a large-scale warming experi-
ment in which we have warmed twelve 5 meter diameter
open-top chambers in forest understory at Duke For-
est. We have warmed these chambers in a regression
design with the warmest chambers as warm as temper-
atures are predicted to be in the region in 2100 and
the coolest chambers at ambient temperatures (We also
have no-chamber controls). These are small worlds each
of which mimics aspects of futures we might face. This
entire set-up is replicated at Harvard Forest. In these
chambers we have been studying the response of insects
(with a focus on ants) and plants over the last ve years.
When we built them these chambers were the biggest
warming experiment in a forest understory in the world.
I don't know if it is still true, but it probably is, if only
because chambers of this size are so hard to keep going
(especially in the early we felt like Fitzcarraldo dragging
a ship through the rainforest) that most people have
decided against repeating them elsewhere.
Some basics on the chambers... http://-
robdunnlab.com/projects/warming-chambers/
I'm writing because on May 25th we are taking the
chambers down and doing a nal inventory of the
response of everything{all the life we can possibly
evaluate{to this warming. To varying extents we have
considered the phenology of plants in the chambers,
many things about ants in the chambers, shifts in
composition of invertebrates in the chambers andsimple responses of bacterial and fungal assemblages in
the chambers. But, we have done all of this delicately,
always mindful to not overly disturb the future world
we are simulating. Now though that the chambers
are coming down we can and will consider roots,
plant biomass, the abundance of insect pests, fungal
pathogens and much, much, more.
As we do this intensive survey, we are hoping to train
as many dierent eyes, lenses and perspectives on the
chambers as possible. If you are potentially interested
in studying some aspect of the response of understory
forest life to warming, let us know. If you are interested
in studying something that can be extracted from soil
or litter samples, we may be able to send you material
you can work on. If you have something grander in
mind (and we love grand things), then we may need
more help from you. If interested, send an email to me,
copied to MJ Epps (Mj Epps <mycota@gmail.com >).
This collaboration might be in the form of bringing a
new method to the chambers (looking at microbial pro-
cesses, for instance) or considering a group of organisms
we've somewhat ignored (e.g., y larvae) or it might be
something totally o the wall. Feel free to share this
email with likable folks that might be interested.
I'm also delighted to hear creative ideas about visualiz-
ing the dierences that have emerged over the years of
this experiment (hence the inclusion of several artists of
various sorts on this email list, if you were wondering
why you were copied).
I hope this email nds you well.
Best,
Rob

Postdoc:FredHutch.ImmuneRepertoireDynamics
A new postdoctoral position is available in the groups of
Trevor Bedford and Erick Matsen at the Fred Hutchin-
son Cancer Research Center located in Seattle, WA.
This position will focus on analyzing immune repertoire
sequence data from an evolutionary perspective.
Deep sequencing of B cell repertoires has opened up
the possibility of understanding the immune response
at a molecular level. This project will analyze reper-
toire data to compare processes of clonal expansion and
anity maturation in primary and secondary immune
responses. These studies will allow, for the rst time, a
detailed mechanistic understanding of original antigenic
sin in viral infection; results from these studies may
allow construction of vaccines that better deal with a
diversity of pathogen exposures. This work represents a
collaboration with experimental colleagues at the Fred
Hutch, Emory University and Adaptive Biotechnologies.
There will be no want of fresh data.
The ideal candidate will have experience with working
with sequence data and a strong interest in model-based
statistical analysis of real data sets. Data sets will
comprise millions of B cell repertoire sequences and so
strong coding abilities are essential. Candidates should
have experience in at least one programming language
and a proven track-record of peer reviewed publications.
Candidates with PhDs from diverse backgrounds are
encouraged to apply, including biology, mathematics,
statistics, physics and computer science. However, expe-
rience in phylogenetics or immunological bioinformatics
is especially opportune. The Fred Hutch is an equal
opportunity employer, committed to workforce diversity.

Postdoc:LoyolaUChicago.MadagascarBirdsPhylogeneticsMacroevolution
An NSF-funded postdoc is available for a project on the
comparative biogeography and diversication of birds in
Madagascar. The postdoc will work jointly with Sushma
Reddy at Loyola University Chicago and Dan Rabosky
at University of Michigan.
The project aims to investigate the origins and history
of the avifauna of Madagascar and study the general
drivers of species diversication in this iconic macroevo-
lutionary laboratory. Birds inhabiting this island are
the result of several independent colonizations from
surrounding regions. Despite arriving in Madagascar
millions of years ago, only half the endemic lineages
have subsequently speciated within this large island.
The project aims at a comprehensive investigation of
the poorly-studied bird diversity on Madagascar to de-
termine what causes some groups to diversify while
others fail to speciate. Specically we will examine
(1) broad-scale phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns
to determine the timing and origins of endemic lin-
eages (2) phylogeographic structure within the island
to investigate cryptic diversity (3) phenotypic diversity
of Malagasy species and their relatives to assess rates
of evolutionary change, and (4) the predictability of
speciation by com paring factors that may inuence
diversication across these clades.
The postdoc will be involved in several dierent as-
pects of the project, including collecting and analyzing
data (genetic, biogeographic, and phenotypic), writing
manuscripts, giving presentations, mentoring students,
and participating in eldwork. The postdoc will have a
unique opportunity to be part of an international collab-
oration and to gain well-rounded skills in evolutionary
biology.
The ideal candidate will have a good publication record
and some experience with NGS data analysis, program-62 EvolDir June 1, 2015

Post-doc position at Montpellier on disease ecology of
malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso
During the last century, WHO have led public health
interventions that resulted in spectacular achievements
such as the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the
elimination of malaria from the Western world. How-
ever, besides major successes achieved in control of
infectious diseases, most elimination/control programs
remain frustrating in many tropical countries where
specic biological and socio-economical features have
prevented implementation of disease control over broad
spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples in-
clude malaria, dengue, yellow fever, measles and HIV.
There is consequently an urgent need to develop af-
fordable and sustainable disease control strategies that
can target the core of infectious disease transmission in
highly endemic areas.
Focusing on Dengue transmission in Phnom Penh (Cam-
bodia) and on malaria spreading in Bobo-Dioulasso
(Burkina Faso), the PANIC project (Pathogen ^As NIChe:
a new approach for infectious diseases control) aims to
develop conceptual, empirical and theoretical frame-
works to envision optimized public health strategies for
vector-borne diseases by considering the most recent
advances in ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.
Funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR,
www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr) for ve years, this
project involves French, Burkinabese and Cambodian64 EvolDir June 1, 2015
researchers from various elds (entomology, virology,
epidemiology, disease ecology, modeling) to tackle this
issue.
Within this context, we are seeking for a post-doctoral
fellow who will focus on data analyses to quantify the
contribution of (i) mosquito population dynamics, (ii)
change in human behavior and (iii) resident immunity
on the spatio-temporal transmission of malaria in Bobo-
Dioulasso. Most of the data relevant to this project
(household socio-economic data, epidemiological time
series and mosquito population dynamics from dierent
neighborhoods) are already available, and additional
data will be collected in the eld at the beginning of the
project. Therefore, several stays have to be expected in
Bobo-Dioulasso, with exible durations.
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in epidemiology or
in ecology and

Montpellier PopulationGenomics
Post-Doctoral position in population genomics \ Mont-
pellier, France
Purpose and responsibilities: The research program
GENESIS focuses on the role of GENetic diversity and
phenotypic plasticity in adaptations to changing Envi-
ronments: a genomic analySIS of a biological invasion.
It involves four academic research teams from UK and
France for the three next years and is opening a post-
doctoral position to work on the conservation genomics
of sh topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, a small
cyprinid species native to East Asia. The post-doc will
be in charge of the analysis of genomic data (GBS) for
conservation genomics and estimating heritability of
tness related traits using a molecular based pedigree.June 1, 2015 EvolDir 65
Research program The main question for the program
is to assess the role of genetic diversity and pheno-
typic plasticity in adapting to changing environmental
conditions. GENESIS uses the framework of biologi-
cal invasion to answer this question as the challenge
for an invasive species is to respond quickly and e-
ciently to changes in the selective regime imposed by the
colonized ecosystem. In addition, a series of stochastic
sampling events associated with the colonization process
is predicted to result in strong genetic drift in invasive
populations, providing the opportunity for rapid evolu-
tionary change through both selection and drift, and the
majority of studies report marked phenotypic change in
invasive populations. The information on heritability
of ecologically signicant life history traits or behaviors
is crucial in accurately predicting responses to selec-
tion and is therefore a key element of GENESIS that
aims at increasing our understanding of factors that
promote establishment success of invasive species and
the response of small fragmented populations to climate
change. A phylogeography will be constructed based
on the genomics data. Further, in order to identify ge-
nomic regions under selection between populations, an
outlier analysiswill be conducted. The problem of
identifying statistically signicant departure from neu-
trality is complicated and results related to assumptions
made, by example to the demographic history of the
samples. A variety of tests have been developed either
making strict assumptions about demographic history
of the populations or estimating for evolutionary non
independence among samples. The candidate will have
a signicant experience of such tests including meth-
ods based on summary statistics (eg Fst) as well as
bayesian hierarchical modelling. The candidate will be
able to choose a justied approach taking into account
the characteristic of the data (SNP and NGS sequenc-
ing), the robustness of the methods to departures from
assumptions, and the consideration of false positive rate.
Practical information for applications The post-doc
position will be hold at the Center for Biology and
Management of Populations at the international ca-

TreeOfLife ComputableSemantics
Postdoctoral fellow in Computable Semantics for the
Tree of Life
The Phyloreferencing project seeks a postdoctoral fellow
for researching and developing computational semantics
approaches to large-scale biodiversity data integration
problems. The project aims to enable addressing ele-
ments in the Tree of Life by unambiguous, transparent,
and fully computable semantics of their patterns of evo-
lutionary descent. The work involves researching and
developing OWL models and ontologies, tools for con-
verting existing data into OWL format, and online proof-
of-concept applications for using machine reasoning to
navigate biodiversity data by Tree of Life-semantics.
The project is a collaboration between Dr. Nico Celli-
nese<http://www.mnh.u.edu/museum-voices/nico-
cellinese/>(Florida Museum of Natural History <
http://www.mnh.u.edu/ >, University of Florida
<http://www.u.edu/ >) and Hilmar Lapp (Cen-
ter for Genomic and Computational Biology <http:/-
/www.genome.duke.edu/ >, Duke University) newly
funded by NSF for 3 years. The incumbent will be
based in the lab of Dr. Cellinese, but will work closely
with both PIs and will periodically travel to Lapp's lab
at Duke University. Starting date is negotiable but the
sooner the better. Salary starts at $45,000.
Why phyloreferencing? Integrating and querying biolog-
ical data across organisms, whether on small or large
scales, to this day relies on traditional names for or-
ganisms and groups of organisms based on Linnaean
nomenclature. However, when it comes to integrating
and communicating data, these suer from two major
limitations. Firstly, because they are simple text-strings,
machines cannot access the meaning intended by those
who coin a name and those who apply it, resulting in
rampant ambiguity and inconsistency in what organism
names are interpreted to mean. Secondly, there are many
groups of organisms for which a Linnaean name does not
and may never exist, but for which valuable biological
knowledge needs to be communicated. The Phyloref-
erencing project aims to address these challenges by
dening ontology-based references ('phyloreferences') to
elements on the Tree of Life that are unambiguous have
fully computable semantics. To accomplish this, we are
using OWL, OWL ontologies, and machine reasoning.
Phyloreferences build on a large body of theoretical andapplied work on phylogenetic taxonomy.
The overall deliverables of the project include a formal
specication for phyloreference encoding and reasoning
in OWL; ascertaining correctness of the specication
using small-scale tests veriable by domain experts; and
a large-scale proof-of-concept application for using phy-

PlantBacteriaSymbiosis
The Sachs Lab at UC Riverside is recruiting a postdoc-
toral scholar to join our team.
The primary goals for this postdoc are exible, but re-
search will focus on the evolution, ecology, and genetics
of plant-bacterial symbioses. To learn more about our
lab see our website (http://www.sachslab.com/).
We work on wild, model, and crop legume species that
interact with the bacterial symbiont lineages Bradyrhi-
zobium and Mesorhizobium. The postdoc can propose
research or can choose their primary research foci once
they join the lab. Major projects in our lab include
i) investigating the evolution and mechanisms of 'host
control' traits in legumes that constrain exploitation in
rhizobial symbiont populations, ii) uncovering competi-
tive interactions among rhizobia in soil communities to
explain the genomic and phenotypic drivers of rhizobial
strain dominance, and iii) using greenhouse, in vitroexperiments, and genotyping to generate novel appli-
cations to improve crop growth. Our group is broad
and has included students focusing on plant biology,
microbiology, genetics and genomics, and evolutionary
ecology.
Candidates should have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biol-
ogy, genetics, genomics, population biology, or related
disciplines. Most importantly, the ideal candidate is a
highly motivated scientists who can work independently
and take projects from initiation to publication. Solid
bacteriology skills and computational competence are
both a plus for this position. A strong background in
evolutionary and or molecular genetics would also be
very useful. Finally, the ideal candidate would also have
experience with next-generation sequencing techniques,
which might include RADseq and highly-multiplexed-
whole genome sequencing. Irrespective of experience,
the postdoc must be able to learn new techniques and
quickly and easily troubleshoot protocols. He or she will
likely work closely with graduate students and the PI
to manage multiple research projects and thus we seek
a team player with excellent leadership skills.
The start date is exible. The position will be available
as early as July 2015, but can begin later if necessary.
The position is initially for a one-year period, with
possible extension of another year, dependent upon sat-
isfactory performance. Salary is commensurate with
experience and qualications.
Interested individuals should send a CV, contact details
of three referees, and a detailed cover letter describing
their interest in the position to joel.sachs@ucr.edu. The
cover letter should outline what types of research you
would like to do in our lab and how your past experience
prepares you for this research. Feel free to e-mail Joel
Sachs to ask any questions about the position or our
lab.

project)June 1, 2015 EvolDir 73
Why do individuals vary in their cognitive abilities?
EVOECOCOG takes the disciplines of cognition and
evolutionary biology into a natural setting to answer this
question. It aims to do this by investigating a variety
of proximate causes and population-level consequences
of individual cognitive variation using a great tit Parus
major population. The project represents one of the rst
large-scale integrative studies of cognitive performance
on any wild population.
Three objectives capture the project1s broad scope: 1)
To characterise proximate causes of variation in cogni-
tive and other associated traits, including personality, all
of which can inuence similar ecologically important be-
haviour. Quantitative genetic, social, parasite-mediated,
and physiological causes will be explored. 2) To examine
links between these traits, key functional behaviours and
trade-os, e.g., space use, niche specialization, predation,
parental care and promiscuity; and 3) To examine the
consequences of this variation for life histories, tness,
natural and sexual selection.
Dates: Application deadline is 1 June 2015. Interviews
will be held initially by Skype within 2 weeks. Start
dates are mid-July or as soon thereafter as possible.

genomes, including de novo assembly of a Mediterranean
amphioxus genome from PacBio long reads, and com-
parative transcriptomics analysis from RNA-seq: (2)
Evolution of sex chromosomes, in the Pannell and Per-
rin labs: assembly and polymorphism analysis of sex
chromosomes from plants and amphibians.
The postdoc would be expected to take a leading posi-
tion on the bioinformatics of the genomics of non-model
organisms, and to participate actively in evolutionary
analyses and interpretation. The postdoc will work
closely with other bioinformaticians and evolutionary
genomicists on both projects. In the medium term,
the postdoc will be expected to develop his or her own
subproject and publications.

**Postdoctoral bioinformatician in Evolutionary ge-
nomics, UNamur, BELGIUM**
A 3-year postdoctoral bioinformatician position is avail-
able to work on the genome evolution of bdelloid rotifers
within the group of Prof.Karine Van Doninck (Labo-
ratory of Evolutionary Genetics and Ecology) atthe
University of Namur (Belgium). The postdoctoral re-
searcher will work on two projects, funded by ARC and
FNRS-MIS, with as main objective to investigate the
origin and causes of the genomic peculiarities found in
the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga./
Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) we previously
characterized the degenerate tetraploid genome struc-
ture of the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga/ with massive
genomic rearrangements involving most of the longest
scaolds. As a consequence, no homologous pair of
chromosomes could be identied within this genome
providing the rst genomic hallmark of ameiotic evo-
lution within this bdelloid rotifer clade. Another pe-
culiarity observed in the genome of /A. vaga/ is the
high percentage of genes (8%) of non-metazoan origin
and probably acquired through horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) (see Flot et al Nature 2013). These features
could be conferred by their long-term ameiotic evolu-
tion. Nonetheless, the unusual lifestyle of many bdelloid
rotifers, involving repeated cycles of desiccation and the
associated DNA DSBs (see Hespeels et al JEB 2014),
may also contribute to genome structure evolution. In
order to determine the origin and causes of these ge-
nomic peculiarities we are starting a comparative analy-
sis of genomes of dierent bdelloid species that diverged
a long time ago, including lineages that have lost the
ability to withstand desiccation, and of an /A. vaga/
clone submitted to several rounds of desiccation. The
postdoc will conduct bioinformatic analyses of genomic
(and transcriptomic) data being generated.
The current team of researchers working on bdelloid
rotifers within the 2 projects include 3 Principal Inves-
tigators (Prof. K. Van Doninck and Dr. F. Chainiaux
from UNamur and Prof. B. Hallet from UCL), 2 post-
doctoral researchers, 3 PhD students, 2 Master students

Investigating insertion and deletion in genomic inference
|
A post-doctoral fellowship in molecular evolution is avail-
able working with Simon Whelan at Uppsala University,
Sweden. The postdoc will join a project working on the
development and application of phylogenetic methods
for studying insertion and deletion both within protein
families and on the genome scale.
The project has two broad aims. The rst is to apply
probabilistic methods we have been developing to study
insertion and deletion rates from aligned or unaligned
sets of sequences. We will use these estimated rates
to study how patterns of insertion and deletion vary
through the genome, both in genes and intergenic DNA,
and how evolutionary forces aect these fundamental
processes. The second aim of the project is to use this
acquired knowledge of insertion and deletion to lter
or rearrange multiple sequence alignments to better re-
ect the true homologous relationships between basesor residues. These approaches will be assessed through
their ability to correctly estimate sequence divergence,
natural selection and phylogeny using both empirical
and simulation data sets. There is also the possibility
for the fellow to develop their own research interests,
providing they t within the broad scope of the project
outlined above.
The fellowship will be located at the Evolutionary Bi-
ology department at the Evolutionary Biology Centre
(EBC), Uppsala, Sweden. Uppsala is a leading cen-
tre for evolution and ecology research, with a large
number of research groups in the subject area. The Evo-
lutionary Biology department (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
Research/IEG/evbiol/?languageId=1) is a diverse and
multi-cultural department, with both computational
and laboratory based research groups working on evolu-
tionary genomics, speciation, population genetics and
phylogenetics. The fellowship will be supported by the
Carl Tryggers Stiftelse (CTS) and will be initially for
one year, with the possibility of extending for an ad-
ditional year. Details of this fellowship are available
(in Swedish; Google Translate works reasonable well) at

The Department of Biology at the University of Vir-
ginia invites applications for a postdoctoral Research
Associate position in the lab of Dr. Robert Cox. The
aims of the position will be tailored to the expertise of
the successful applicant and will be closely associated
with our NSF-funded research on the evolutionary and
ecological genetics of sexual dimorphism and genomic
conict in Anolis lizards.
Our research blends perspectives from ecology, genet-
ics, and physiology to study the evolutionary dynamics
associated with the highly divergent reproductive roles
of males and females. Using sexually dimorphic Anolis
lizards as a model system, we study a variety of ques-
tions related to the quantitative genetics of sexually
dimorphic phenotypes and tness optima, the physi-
ological and endocrine mechanisms that underlie sex
dierences in development, and the roles of natural and
sexual selection in shaping the evolutionary trajectories
of males and females in the wild. Our typical approaches
include large-scale breeding studies in the lab, phyloge-
netic comparative analyses, phenotypic manipulations,
and long-term studies of natural selection, sexual selec-
tion, and quantitative genetics of wild lizard populations
in Florida and The Bahamas.
The Research Associate will work closely with the PI,
collaborators, and lab personnel to design and lead re-
search in the lab and eld. The position also involves
preparation of grant proposals, conference presentations,
and manuscripts, management and analysis of data, and
mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. The
ideal candidate will demonstrate the ability to integrate
across biological disciplines and use the appointment to
develop and pursue novel, exciting questions. Demon-
strated expertise in ecological or evolutionary genetics is
required. Preferred skills include expertise in some com-
bination of the following: selection analysis, RAD-seq,
RNA-seq, programming and bioinformatics related to
the above, and quantitative genetics of wild populations
using an animal-model framework.
The completion of a PhD degree in Biology or related
eld by the start date of the appointment is required.
Preferred appointment start date is September 1, 2015,84 EvolDir June 1, 2015
but alternative start dates are possible. This is a one-
year appointment; however, appointment may be re-
newed for an additional two one-year increments, con-
tingent upon available funding and satisfactory perfor-
mance.
To apply, please submit a candidate prole through

tional genomic changes associated with the beetle's host
range expansion onto potato, the colonization of novel
climatic regimes, and the rapid development of insecti-
cide resistance (to over 50 classes of insecticides!).
Position Responsibilities:
The post-doctoral associate will be expected to analyze
whole-genome resequence data to assess the popula-
tion genomics and structural genomic changes across
a diverse sample of Colorado potato beetle genomes.
This project will provide training opportunities in bioin-
formatics analysis, population genetic modeling and
phylogenomic analysis. Desirable skills for this project
include familiarity with Linux operating systems and
computer programming (Perl, Python, and R), as well as
previous experience analyzing population genetic data.
How to Apply:
Funding for this position is available for 1 year with
the possibility of extension. To apply, please send
a single pdf with a cover letter, a CV, 1-2 represen-
tative publications, and names and contact informa-
tion for 3 references to Dr. Sean Schoville, email:

http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/Downloads/-
OIE announcements.pdf The need for eective
and automated analyses of viral sequences has increased
exponentially with the new high- c-throughput sequenc-
ing technologies. An understanding of the dierentbioinformatic approaches available for processing these
data is an essential step in most virological studies.
We will be giving a 5- cday course, which will consist of
a series of lectures and practical exercises that directly
address bioinformatic challenges posed by the current
deluge of sequence data. We will enable participants
to understand and deal with high- c- throughput se-
quence datasets and encourage the exchange of ideas
among diagnosticians, virologists, bioinformaticians and
evolutionary biologists.
The 2015 course will introduce the participants to the
power of the UNIX command- c- line and bash scripts,
as well as a suite of bioinformatics tools covering the
following topics:
- HTS sequencing technologies: overview of the dierent
HTS platforms and sample preparations. - Unix primer:
introduction to Bio- c-Linux and essential bash script-
ing. - Reference assembly: aligning sequence reads to
a known reference and visualizing the alignment; (e.g.,
bowtie2, BWA, Tanoti, Tablet, UGENE). - Variant call-
ing: consensus sequence generation, low frequency vari-
ant calling and error correction; (e.g., LoFreq, VPhaser).
- De- c-novo assembly: overlap layout and De Bruijn
graphs approaches for sequence assembly; (e.g., Velvet,
IDBA- c-UD). - Metagenomic analyses: sanitizing se-
quence datasets, assembling, annotating, visualizing;
(e.g., MetAMOS, Krona, MEGAN). - Genomics: scaf-
folding, improving the assembly, nishing the assembly,
gene annotation; (e.g., ICORN, Artemis). - Phyloge-
netic analysis: introduction to multiple sequence align-
ment and phylogenetic reconstruction; (e.g., clustal,
PhyML).

|{cE3c - Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental
Changes Advanced Course Practical Course on Phylo-
geography
organized by Octavio Paulo jJuly 6-10 2015 @ Lisbon,
Portugal
Objectives: Phylogeography is one of the recent scientic
areas emergent from the dissemination of highthrouput
technologies of sequencing starting in the 90's of the
XXth century, with the consequent development of intra-
specic genetic variance analysis and its geographic dis-
tribution. The analysis of phylogeographic data allows
to study the processes of population dierentiation and
the underlying evolutionary and demographic history.
Applications of this body of knowledge go from conserva-
tion genetics to the study of the evolution of species and
populations. This course is aimed at students and pro-
fessionals that intend to get started on phylogeographic
analysis as well as researchers already with some experi-
ence that want to deepen or update their knowledge in
the eld. The course involves theoretical classes as well
as hands-on practical sessions using software. Partici-
pants are encouraged to bring their own sequence data
for analysis.

The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological
Synthesis (NIMBioS) is now accepting applications for92 EvolDir June 1, 2015
its Tutorial, \Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics," to
be held August 10-15, 2015, at NIMBioS.
*Objectives: *Quantitative genetic theory has been ap-
plied to a wide range of phenomena including the evolu-
tion of dierences between the sexes, sexual preferences,
life history traits, plasticity of traits, as well as the
evolution of body size and other morphological mea-
surements. This tutorial is for evolutionary biologists
interested in how quantitative genetics theory can be
tested with data, both from single species and with
multiple-species phylogenies. Participants V graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty V will learn how
to use R to build and test evolutionary models. There
is a need for evolutionary biologists to understand the
eld of evolutionary quantitative genetics because of the
ability to collect large amounts of data by computer,
the development of statistical methods for changes of
traits on evolutionary trees and for changes in a single
species through time, and the realization that quanti-
tative characters will not soon be fully explained by
genomics.
The content of this tutorial will be similar to the
workshop held at NIMBioS in 2014. For information

Vairao, Portugal
During this 3 days course, the participants will be ex-
posed to the scientic basis and practical applications
of the study of wildlife population biology. The mod-
ern study of wildlife population ecology orchestrates a
dance at the interface of reliable eldwork and the use of
mathematical tools and population genetic techniques.
Participants will learn how to collect the data necessary
to study wildlife populations, and how to assess the
factors that aect population growth and interactions
with other species. This will include descriptors of pop-ulation dynamics (eg. Trends in abundance, cycles),
projections of deterministic and stochastic population
models with stage structure, mechanisms and modeling
of density dependence (positive and negative), targeting
specic conservation actions through sensitivity analy-
sis, metapopulation and source-sink dynamics, viability
analysis, and the interface between genetic variation
and population performance. The focus will be on how
to rigorously analyze population dynamics and apply
the inferences to better conservation decision-making.

This workshop is organized by Prof. Micha el Taborsky

Invited speakers: Dr. Sarah Brosnan, Georgia State
University (US) Prof. Thomas Bugnyar, University of
Vienna (AT) Dr. Sasha Dall, University of Exeter (UK)
Dr. Keith Jensen, University of Manchester (UK) Prof.
Alex Kacelnik, University of Oxford (UK) Prof. Jens

The program of the workshop will consist of a combi-
nation of plenary talks by invited speakers and work
performed in small groups, in which the participants
will discuss a particular theme together with one of
the invited speakers. The results of these small-group
sessions willl be presented to the plenum by student
participants, followed by a general discussion.
Adaptive decision making depends on the quality of
available information. The signicance of direct or in-
direct information involved in social decisions is little
understood. Evidence for constraints and substantial
costs in the acquisition and processing of information is
accumulating. Accordingly, behavioural decisions often
seem to be made with imperfect knowledge, following
\rules of thumb" rather than applying prudent assessment
to make optimal choices. Furthermore, individuals may
or may not benet from sharing information; hence they
may transmit only partial or false information. The aim
of this workshop is to discuss these issues in an evolution-
ary framework, both from an empirical and theoretical
perspective. Questions discussed in this workshop will
include, for instance, how dierent costs of information
acquisition and use will change predictions on adaptive
decision making; or, whether seemingly irrational or
\wrong" decisions may actually make sense when tak ing
costs and constraints on information use into account.
These are topics of great interest to students and sci-
entists from dierent disciplines, such as behavioural
ecology, neurobiology, cognitive sciences, and psychology.
Interaction between dierent elds will identify open
questions and directions for future interdisciplinary re-
search.

Date: 24 August - 4 September 2015 Place: W adenswil
(Z urich lake), Switzerland Organizers: Maria Anisimova
and Theo Smits
Target audience are researchers who: - wish to study
microbial pathogens, their genomes & evolutionary dy-
namics as a result of host-pathogen interaction interac-
tion or environmental changes - willing to learn how to
use bioinformatics tools for genome analyses
Summary: With >28'000 microbial genomes sequenced
today, a broader range of researchers can step into NGS
genomics without the prior knowledge of the complex-
ity involved. GEMP2015 oers a steady and hands-on
introduction to the analysis of raw NGS data, from the
assembly of raw reads into a high-quality genome, to
annotation and the evolutionary analyses of sequences.
GEMP 2015 aims to show how computational analyses
of genomic data may bring insights into the molecular
evolution of pathogenicity and host-pathogen interac-
tions. Special attention is dedicated to statistical hy-
pothesis testing to detect non-neutral evolution, which
may point to functionally relevant molecular changes
due to adaptive processes.
GEMP 2015 oers a combination of lectures, exercises
and discussions around problems arising with real NGS
data. Participants will acquire practical experience of
handing large NGS data with a variety of free and com-
mercial software packages. As a highlight of the course,
internationally renowned experts will present their work
on pathogen genomics in a mini-symposium.

own means of transportation to and from the course,
however.
The course will be open to a maximum of 18 students,
as large parts of the course will consist of hands-on exer-
cises. The aim is a broad mix of students both from the
University of Gothenburg and from the outside, mainly
PhD students but postdocs are also welcome to apply.
Knowledge of general molecular biology and genetics is
necessary, as is some previous experience with command-
line interfaces. Previous experience working on a remote
server will also be benecial. No previous bioinformatics
skills are needed, however.

of the Department of Marine Sciences 200X-XX-XX,
200X-XX-XX.
Discipline: Natural Science Responsible department:
Department of Marine Sciences Main elds of study:
Bioinformatics
2. Position in the educational system
Elective course; third-cycle education.
3. Entry requirements
Admitted to third cycle education.
4. Course content
This course aims at detailed understanding and hands-
on experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one's own biological research questions. An
important aspect of the course is to show how genomic
data can be applied to address and answer research
questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, population
biology, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The
students will be trained in the latest bioinformatic meth-
ods to analyze high throughput sequencing data, which
is present in many research projects. The course will
cover basic computing tools required to run command
line applications, processing high throughput sequencing
data of the CO1 gene from environmental samples to
reveal biodiversity and analysis of sequencing data from
whole genome scans for population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general computing
tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line envi-
ronment, bash commands, data formatting using regular
expressions and basic scripting in the unix shell with a
series of examples and exercises. The course introduces
bioinformatics software for analysis of sequence data
from metagenetics (The high-throughput sequencing of a
molecular marker from an ecosystem or a community of
organisms, used for large-scale analyses of biodiversity),
through a series of live demonstrations (AmpliconNoise,
TaxAssign, QIIME). The course also introduces basic
and advanced concepts of population genomics data
analysis such as genome/transcriptome assembly, anno-
tation (BLAST), alignment/mapping, dierential Gene
expression, functional enrichment tests, SNP genotyp-
ing, PCA, outlier tests. The course corresponds to 1
week of full time studies and and is composed of lectures,
demonstrations and computer labs.
5. Outcomes
1. Knowledge and understanding 1a. Demonstrate
advanced knowledge of experimental strategies, applica-
tions and tools of DNA barcoding/metabarcoding and
population genomics. 1b. Demonstrate advanced knowl-
edge of the potential of genomics approaches to answer98 EvolDir June 1, 2015
ecosystem-wide questions, in particular for biodiversity
monitoring.
2. Skills and abilities 2a. Ability to use basic commands
in the Unix command line environment (reformatting
data with regular expressions, basic scripting, running
python scripts from the unix shell)
2b. Ability to use metagenetics software tools to anal-
yse sequence data from environmental samples (data
cleaning steps, clustering of reads into operational taxo-
nomic units (OTUs) and taxonomic assignment through
hidden markov models and database matching (BLAST,
barcode of life database).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
