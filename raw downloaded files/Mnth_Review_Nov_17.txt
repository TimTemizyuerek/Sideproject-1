Dear all
We have been lucky enough to get the Royal Society to
host a two-day meeting entitled Sexual selection: pat-
terns in the history of life in May 2018. We have made
a point of bringing together both biologists working
on contemporary systems and palaeontologists, and we
have been able to assemble a stellar lineup of speakers.
There is a limited number of places available for non-
speakers, and we will also be having a poster session.

GENOMIC BASIS OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION
A symposium hosted by Senckenberg Biodiversity and
Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt, Germany

Senckenberg Museum of Natural History in Frankfurt
am Main
Senckenberganlage 25

Global warming and changing climatic conditions will
require organisms to either track their climatic niche
or rapidly adapt to new conditions. Our understand-
ing of the genomic basis underlying climate adaptation
across various taxa is currently growing fast. We have
so far learned about adaptive inversion clines, polygenic
traits, the interplay of standing genetic variation and
newly arising mutations, adaptation in symbiotic sys-
tems, and the role of adaptive introgression between
species. These species-specic responses now raise more
general scientic questions:
I) Which processes and genomic features further or hin-
der adaptation?
II) Are common patterns arising in terms of genes or
pathways responding to climate stress selection? What
are the relative roles of transcription changes versus
structural changes?
III) Which directions of research are promising for the
future?
IV) Which next generation sequencing techniques, and
other methods, are most appropriate in the near future?
This symposium aims at bringing together leading sci-
entists in the eld to discuss recent results in genomic
climate adaptation. Particularly, we want to integrate
knowledge across disciplines (e.g. population genetics,
molecular ecology/evolution, bioinformatics), and across
taxa (e.g. plants, animals, fungi). Together, we want to
identify open questions and promising methodology, and
conceptually advance this scientically and societally
important eld.Conrmed keynote lecturers:
Outi Savolainen (University of Oulu, Finland), Alan O.
Bergland (University of Virginia, USA)
Conrmed plenary speakers:

MESSAGE TITLE: 32 seats left: 2018 Predator-Prey
Interactions Gordon Research Conference MESSAGE
BODY:
Third Gordon Research Conference on Predator-Prey
Interactions
January 28 - February 2, 2018, Ventura, California
https://www.grc.org/predator-prey-interactions-
conference/2018/ Gordon Research Conferences
are recognized as the \world's premier scientic
conferences", where leading investigators from around
the globe meet biennially for a full week of intense
discussion of the frontier research in their eld. We
have an outstanding list of conrmed speakers and
contributors, detailed below. Our meeting is capped at
200 people, and we've already accepted 168 applicants
(listed at the bottom of this email); so please apply
soon.
The neurobiology of responses to risk in individual prey
can, when aggregated across a population, profoundly
aect surrounding ecosystems. Similarly, researchers
are increasingly aware of how quickly selection and epi-
genetic forces can shift prey phenotypes and alter future
interactions with predators. In both cases, the connec-
tions between small-scale (within an individual or at
a single point in time) and large-scale (across ecosys-
tems or generations) processes illustrate how exploring
the 'linkage map' of predator-prey interactions across
scales can identify new elds of research and synergize
the collaborations necessary to address them. We have
targeted the most exciting advances in predator-prey
work across multiple elds, with each speaker agreeing
to share their latest unpublished ndings. In order to
encourage active participation from everyone at the con-
ference, all attendees are strongly encouraged to present
a poster on their work.
The complete program is available, along with fur-
ther details concerning registration, at our web-
site (https://www.grc.org/predator-prey-interactions-
conference/2018/).

ComparativeBiology
American Museum of Natural History Richard Gilder
Graduate School Comparative Biology Ph.D. Program
and Graduate Fellowships Program
The AMNH RGGS Ph.D. Program in Comparative Biol-
ogy is training the next generation of biologists through
an integrative approach that focuses on the history, evo-
lutionary relationships, and interactions among species.
It utilizes the Museum's strength and experience in
research and training to educate a new generation of
scientists and industry leaders. The AMNH provides ex-
ceptional support facilities for student research, with col-
lections of more than 33 million specimens and artifacts.
Training and research opportunities exist across a wide
array of disciplines in comparative biology, incorporating
research in systematic and evolutionary biology, pale-
ontology, conservation biology, comparative genomics,
computational biology, Earth history, anthropology, and
biological and cultural diversity. Global eldwork, with
AMNH faculty, student-led or in partnership with others,
provides exceptional research opportunities for students.
RGGS students may take advantage of RGGS course
cross-enrollment agreements with partner universities
Columbia and the City University of New York. Armed
with a Gilder School education, graduates will not only
understand the history and diversity of life on Earth, but
may contribute to advances in human health, biodiver-
sity conservation, and other related biological research
elds as well.
This is an accelerated program, designed for students
to complete their degrees in four years. Students willearn a minimum of 62 credits through a combination of
coursework, teaching assistantships, and individual dis-
sertation research. The Richard Gilder Graduate School
will typically provide full nancial support to students
matriculating in the Comparative Biology Ph.D. Pro-
gram.
We also oer Graduate Fellowships for students inter-
ested in earning a Ph.D. at one of our partner institu-
tions (Columbia University, CUNY, NYU, Stony Brook
and Cornell University), when they are advised by an
AMNH curator.
The AMNH Graduate Student Fellowship Program is
an educational partnership with selected universities,
dedicated to the training of Ph.D. candidates in those
scientic disciplines practiced at the Museum. Our
current collaborations are with Columbia University,
City University of New York (CUNY), Cornell Univer-
sity, Stony Brook University, and New York University
(NYU). The host university in which the student en-
rolls exercises educational jurisdiction over the students
and formally awards the degree. In these partnership
programs, at least one Museum curator must serve as a
graduate advisor, co-major professor or major professor,
and adjunct university faculty member. Each student
benets by having the sta and facilities of both the
university and the Museum to support his/her training
and research. To be eligible for the AMNH Graduate
Fellowship, students must apply to both the host Uni-
versity's Ph.D. program and to the AMNH Graduate
Student Fellowships Program. Students already matric-
ulated in a Ph.D. program are not eligible to apply; only
new, rst-time Ph.D. applicants will be considered.

CardiU AmphibianConservation
PhD Opportunity at Cardi University
Understanding the dynamics and determinants of recov-
ery of a regionally iconic wild food resource following
its near-extinction due to infectious disease
Main supervisor: Pablo Orozco-terWengel (Cardi Uni-
versity)
Co-supervisor: Andrew Cunningham (Zoological Society
of London; Institute of Zoology)
Co-supervisor: Mark Beaumont (Bristol University)
Co-supervisor: Mike Bruford (Cardi University)
Non-academic supervisor: Richard Young (Durrell
Wildlife Conservation Trust)November 1, 2017 EvolDir 13
Application Deadline: Monday 4th December
Project Description
The Mountain Chicken Frog (MCF) is one of the
world's largest amphibians and is endemic to the
Caribbean islands of Dominica and Montserrat. This
iconic species has traditionally been an important part
of the local cultures, playing a major role in nutrition
with an estimated 36,000 animals harvested annually
for human consumption on Dominica alone. However,
the emergence of chytridiomycosis due to infection
with the fungus, Batrachochytridium dendrobatidis -
Bd, in 2002 in Dominica led to the near-extinction of
the species on the island. Despite eorts to avoid its
introduction to Montserrat, Bd reached that island,
with mass mortality rst being detected in February
2009. Bd is major threat to amphibian populations,
having caused the extinction of >200 amphibian species
worldwide in recent decades. The Bd infection of MCF
on Dominica and Montserrat is an ideal case study
that can be used to understand the dynamics and
determinants of species recovery following catastrophic
declines due to infectious disease. This project is of
a multidisciplinary nature, combining laboratory and
eld work, next generation sequencing techniques,
bioinformatics and epidemiology, as well as engagement
with stakeholders involved in the management of
remaining populations of MCF. You will carry out
eld work in Dominica with the Institute of Zoology
and local partners involved in MCF research. Using
a combination of chytridiomycosis susceptible and
tolerant animals identied in the past two years and
during the course of the project, a combination of
analyses aiming to characterise immune related genes
(e.g. MHC) and the skin microbiome (skin is the only
tissue infected by Bd in adult frogs) will be carried
out to identify dierences between the two types of
animals that might be related to resistance to the
development of chytridiomycosis. For more information
on this project, please see the following links: https:/-

ETH Zurich
PlantPathogenEvolution
PhD position in Plant-Pathogen Interactions in the
Plant Pathology group at ETH Zurich
The Plant Pathology group of ETH Zurich is multidisci-
plinary and encompasses several research areas including
evolutionary biology, ecology, population genomics and
molecular biology. The molecular biology team led by
Andrea Sanchez Vallet aims to understand the molecular
mechanisms that enable necrotrophic pathogens to infect
plants and also seeks to understand how host-pathogen
interactions respond to genetic diversity.
Work description Natural infections are often caused
by mixtures of genetically dierent pathogen strains
(multi-infection). Most research projects aim to under-
stand the interactions of individual hosts with single
pathogen strains. The consequences of simultaneous
infection by multiple pathogen strains for disease devel-
opment, epidemiology and pathogen evolution remain
largely unexplored. This research project will explore
the consequences of multi-infections on disease outcome
and pathogen evolution.Our model system for studying multi-infections is Zy-
moseptoria tritici, a major fungal pathogen of wheat
that commonly exhibits multi-infection in nature. Ex-
tensive knowledge of Z. tritici population genetics and
genomics, transcriptomics and infection processes has
already been developed in our labs and will provide the
tools needed to study the interaction between dierent
pathogen strains within the wheat host.
This research project has three main objectives: 1. De-
termine the eect of multi-infections on disease devel-
opment and epidemiology. 2. Characterize how growth
patterns in planta are aected by multi- infections com-
pared to mono-infections. 3. Characterize the molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying strain interactions in multi-
infections.
Desired prole * We seek highly motivated individuals
interested in host-parasite interactions. The successful
candidate should have experience in molecular biology,
confocal microscopy and bioinformatics. * Experience
in microbiology is desired. * The candidate should hold
a BSc or MSc degree in plant science, microbiology
or plant pathology. * Good communication skills in
English are required.
Applications The application should include: * A moti-
vation letter describing your research interests and your
personal rationale for applying for this PhD position.
In addition, it should include an outline of your relevant
current knowledge and skills, indicating how these will
be useful for the research project (max. 300 words). *
A detailed CV that includes all relevant experience. *
Ocial transcripts (in English) of your higher education
qualications. * Names, addresses and phone numbers
of two referees.
Supervisors: Dr. Andrea Sanchez Vallet and Prof.
Bruce A. McDonald
The application should be submitted as a sin-
gle pdf le sent to Andrea S anchez Vallet (an-
drea.sanchez@usys.ethz.ch). Applications can be sub-
mitted before 15th November 2017.

Europe 15 PlantAdaptation
Dear all,
15 PhD student positions are currently available within
the EU-funded European training Network EpiDiverse
(www.epidiverse.eu). The EpiDiverse network - Epige-
netic Diversity in Ecology - joins research groups from
ecology, molecular (epi)genetics and bioinformatics to
study epigenetic mechanisms and their adaptive rele-
vance in natural plant populations.
For information on the positions and to apply, please go
to: https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/vacancies-epidiverse The
15 positions are distributed over 12 dierent European
universities and research institutes (see below). The
cross-disciplinary research program investigates how epi-
genetic mechanisms, in interaction with environments
and transposable elements, contribute to variation that
is relevant for the adaptive capacity of plants. By apply-
ing epigenomic research tools to a selection of dierent
wild plants (including long-lived trees, annual and asex-
ually reproducing species) we investigate how epigenetic
mechanisms, and their ecological relevance, dier be-
tween plant species. The network facilitates close collab-
orations between individual research projects and will
provide comprehensive training in molecular, genomic,
computational and ecological/evolutionary aspects of
studying natural epigenetic variation.
The deadline for applications is 24 November 2017. The
xed starting date for all projects is 1 April 2018.
For these positions EU eligibility and mobility criteria
apply: candidates must be, at the time of recruitment,
in the rst four years of their research careers and have
not yet been awarded a doctoral degree. Eligible candi-
dates may be of any nationality but must not, at the
time of recruitment, have resided or carried out their
main activity in the country of the recruiting host or-
ganisation for more than 12 months in the 3 last years
immediately prior to the reference date.

PlantMicrobeInteractions
The Byers lab at Illinois State University is recruiting
graduate students interested in the evolutionary dynam-
ics of plant and soil microbes as well as plant - pollinator
dynamics in the fragmented landscape of Midwestern
prairies. Our recent work has been focused on the im-
pacts of genetic drift on the frequency of female plants
of a native prairie plant with a gynodioecious breeding
system - Lobelia spicata. Given interesting patterns
in earlier results we are now focusing on the potential
impacts of soil pathogens or mutualisms in altering the
relative tness of the dierent sexes.
We are also working in collaboration with multiple re-
searchers at the University of Kansas and University of
Minnesota on the role of plant-pathogen interactions in
the maintenance of species diversity. This recently NSF-
funded project will be assessing these interactions across
rainfall and species diversity gradients in Midwestern
U.S. prairies.
The position is for a talented and industrious graduate
student to work on this NSF-funded project, which will
be focusing on prairie plant-microbial interactions in
the high diversity tallgrass prairies of Illinois. This work
will be done in close coordination with parallel eld and
greenhouse projects in Kansas. The student will have
the opportunity to develop additional directions linked
to our work with Lobelia spicata.
Illinois State University is located in central Illinois
in the college-dominated medium-size town of Normal,

and population histories of non-model organisms in un-
precedented detail. Key questions related to adaptation
include, the type and number of genetic changes which
underpin the evolution of new phenotypes, the strength
and time scales for selection, the extent of parallel and
convergent evolution among dierent taxa, and the na-
ture of environmental and ecological factors which drive
natural selection. Understanding these mechanisms not
only provides fundamental insights into the process of
evolution, but is also important for assessing species
vulnerability and responses to potential future environ-
mental change.
This project provides a unique opportunity to examine
adaptation and evolutionary history in an iconic set
of species for evolutionary biologists, the marine (Am-
blyrhynchus cristatus) and land iguanas (Conolophus
sp) of the Galapagos archipelago. Both genera of Gala-
pagos iguanas originate from the same common ancestor,
which diverged around 10.5 million years ago, with both
groups subsequently spreading across the archipelago.
Land iguanas diversied to form 3 species - Conolo-
phus subcristatus, native to six islands, and Conolophus
pallidus, which is restricted to Santa Fe. The third
species Conolophus marthae, known as the pink iguana,
is only found on Volcan Wolf at the northern end of
Isabela. It was only recently recognised as forming a
genetically and ecologically distinct species and is now
considered endangered due to its small population size
and restricted distribution.The process of divergence and diversication among
these iguanas has generated many novel adaptations
over relatively short evolutionary timescales - most strik-
ingly adaptation to diving and the marine environment
in Amblyrhynchus cristatus, which is the world's only
marine lizard. Land iguanas have their own adaptations
to the harsh terrestrial environment in the Galapagos, in-
cluding diet, tolerance of arid conditions and uctuating
resources, as well as various dierences in morphology
and pigmentation. This provides an amazing natural
model system for evolutionary biologists to characterise
the genomic basis of adaptation and novel phenotypes;
the process of speciation, including mechanisms that
prevent hybridization and genetic introgression; as well
as characterising the origins and history of iguana pop-
ulations. These can be linked with palao- and present
environmental data to yield a better understanding of
the environmental and ecological conditions which drove
the evolution of these species.
The project is a collaboration between Dr Simon Good-
man and Dr Mary O'Connell at the University of Leeds,
and Dr Gabriele Gentile at the University of Rome Tor
Vegata. Dr Gentile has been pioneering the study and
conservation of pink iguanas for many years. The stu-
dent will spend time working in both Leeds and Rome.
Multiple genome sequences for all land and marine
iguana species are currently being generated, as a result
of a collaboration between the University of Rome Tor
Vegata and the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (Prof.
Mohd Firdaus Raih) and will be completed shortly. The
aims for this PhD project include:
1. Complete the annotation of the nuclear and mitochon-
drial genomes of Galapagos iguanas. 2. Use comparative
genomic and molecular evolutionary approaches to de-
tect signatures of selection at a genome-wide scale. 3.
Identify genes and other sequence variation related to
adaptation to diving and other evolutionary trajecto-
ries, such as patterns of pigmentation, and DNA repair,
driven by selection or drift. 4. Use nuclear genome
data to investigate the interaction between pigmenta-
tion, DNA repair system genes and their possible role in
determining rates of molecular evolution along dierent
lineages. 5. Use mtDNA and its methylation patterns
to provide insights on the level of expression and regu-
lation of mitochondrial genes and its possible link with
metabolic rates, which may ultimately inuence rates
of molecular evolution of mtDNA. 6. There is potential
to generate additional data at a population scale to
conduct high resolution analyses of population history
in land and marine iguanas.

ModelingAntibioticResistance
I am seeking a PhD student to work on mathematical
models of plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance in my new
group in the Department for Evolutionary Theory at
the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in
Pl on, Germany.
Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements that can
be transmitted vertically or be transferred horizontally
between cells. Clinically relevant antibiotic resistance is
often encoded on plasmids rather than on the chromo-
some, which can lead to special evolutionary dynamics.
The aim of the PhD project is to develop mathematical
models for the evolution and spread of resistance on
plasmids. On the mathematical side, the analysis will
mainly be based on branching process theory, comple-
mented by deterministic ODE systems and stochastic
computer simulations.
Applicants should have a degree in mathematics, physics,
biology, or another related eld. A prerequisite is a keen
interest both in mathematical modeling and in biological
systems. Good quantitative skills are essential. Expe-
rience in mathematical modeling and knowledge of a
programming language (C, C++, Java, R, Python) is
an advantage.
The PhD student will join a vibrant interdisciplinary
institute with departments spanning evolutionary genet-
ics, experimental evolution, evolutionary ecology, and
theoretical biology. The Max Planck Institute provides
an international working environment with an excellent
infrastructure. With the close-by Universities of L ubeck
and Kiel and the Kiel Evolution Center, it is embedded
into a collaborative scientic community. The town of
Pl on is surrounded by lakes and close to the Baltic Sea,
oering ample opportunity for outdoor activities. The
cities of Kiel and L ubeck can be easily reached by train
in 30 and 40 minutes, respectively.
The payment and benets are according to a 50% po-
sition of the remuneration level 13 within the TV oD
and the appointment is for 3 years. This corresponds toa typical German PhD salary, includes social benets,
and easily covers the costs of living.
Interested students should send their application (moti-
vation letter, CV, copies of certicates, contact details
of two references) by email to uecker@evolbio.mpg.de.
Please use the code PhD2017 in the subject line.
The Max Planck Society is committed to employing
more handicapped individuals and especially encour-

MichiganState PopGen
The Bradburd Lab at Michigan State University is seek-
ing motivated PhD students interested in studying sta-
tistical population genetics.
The lab is focused on evolutionary biology and popu-
lation genetics, and especially on statistical methods
for inferring and visualizing complex patterns of genetic
information over space and time. There are currently
two main lines of inquiry in the lab:
1) Spatial population genetics: using spatial population
genetic data to study the processes that have generated
patterns of genetic variation, with a particular focus on
isolation, migration, and local adaptation.
2) Temporal population genetics: studying how popula-
tion structure changes across space and through time,
especially geared toward understanding how populations
adapt to climate change
I am interested in students who would like to collabo-
rate on these projects or develop independent research
programs in the general elds of population and evo-
lutionary genetics/genomics. I am open to advising
students who develop their own empirical systems, but
I expect all students to be excited about statistical
population genetics methods.
Positions: Students will be admitted through
the Integrative Biology Department (https://-

Group ( https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu) at MSU.
Qualications: Applicants should hold a bachelor's de-
gree in biology, statistics, computer science, or a re-
lated eld. Preference will be given to applicants with
previous relevant research experience. A passion for
evolutionary biology, data analysis, and quantitative
methods is a key asset. The Bradburd Lab is dedicated
to being a safe space for diversity in STEM.
Funding: Students in the lab will receive a generous
stipend, research and travel funds, and tuition waivers.
Financial support comes through research and teaching

The Range lab in the Department of Biological Sciences
at Mississippi State University is recruiting graduate
students interested in evolutionary and developmental
biology. Research in the lab focuses on understanding
how a network of three dierent Wnt signaling branches
(Wnt/Beta-catenin, Wnt/JNK, and Wnt/Ca2+) coor-
dinate the regulatory networks that establish territo-
ries along the anterior-posterior axis, using sea urchin
embryos as the primary model system. Remarkably,
functional and expression studies in other metazoans
(vertebrates, urochordates, hemichordates, echinoderms
and cnidarians) suggest that many aspects of this Wnt
signaling network governing AP axis specication iden-
tied in the sea urchin are part of the ancient AP pat-
terning mechanism that existed in the common ancestor
of bilaterians and cnidarians.
We also work closely with Counterman lab at MSU to
study how Wnt signaling is involved in buttery wing
pattern development. In collaboration, we have begun
to characterize the Wnt network of signaling governing
pigmentary and structurally-based color patterns.
The position is for a talented PhD student to work on
a NIH funded project beginning as early as the Spring
of 2018. The student project will focus on the roles
of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (Wnt/JNK
and Wnt/Ca2+) in patterning the early AP axis in seaNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 25
urchin embryos. The student will also have opportuni-
ties to study similar Wnt pathways in buttery wing
development. The position oers training in a com-
bination of molecular manipulations, high-throughput
genome-wide assays and bioinformatics, gene regulatory
network analysis as well as classical embryology.
Mississippi State University is situated in the quintessen-
tial college town of Starkville and is located close to
several major cities (e.g. New Orleans, Memphis, Birm-
ingham) as well as the beaches along the Gulf of Mexico.

Graduate research fellowships in ecological adaptation
THE UNVEIL RESEARCH NETWORK: We are
pleased to announce several Ph.D. fellowship opportu-
nities at the University of Montana and the University
of Nebraska as part of a new collaborative research
and training network created to advance evolutionary
and ecological genomics in natural populations. The
NSF-funded UNVEIL network (Using Natural Varia-tion to Educate, Innovate, and Lead) brings together
researchers from the University of Montana (UM) and
the University of Nebraska Lincoln (UNL). The network
seeks to advance understanding of the genetic basis of
tness-related traits in wild populations and to train the
next generation of integrative biologists to solve press-
ing societal challenges in ecological and conservation
genomics.
The research and training activities of the UNVEIL net-
work will center around three core projects united by
their conceptual focus on adaptation to spatiotemporal
environmental variation - high altitude adaptation and
hypoxia resistance in deer mice, adaptation to seasonal
environments in snowshoe hares, and thermal adapta-
tion in yellow monkeyowers. A more detailed descrip-
tion of the research and training network is available
through the UNVEIL website (www.unveilnetwork.org).
FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES: Two forms of fel-
lowship support are available through this program.
First, several fellowships will be available to top ap-
plicants to UM or UNL whose research interests are
within the core research foci of the network. Second,
two UNVEIL Diversity Fellowships will be available
starting Fall of 2018 to support one graduate fellow
on each campus for a three-year tenure. We encour-
age applications from students broadly interested in
the study of evolutionary adaptation in variable en-
vironments and genome-to-phenome connections and
whose backgrounds are traditionally underrepresented
in STEM elds, including students with no family his-
tory of higher education (i.e., rst generation college
students).
HOW TO APPLY: Interested applicants are strongly
encouraged to *contact one or more* *project PIs or
other network members* (www.unveilnetwork.org/our-
team/) *whose interests overlap with their own prior to
developing their application.* Graduate students seek-
ing to join the UNVEIL network must be admitted into
aliated graduate programs at either the University of
Montana (Organismal Biology, Ecology, and Evolution
or Wildlife Biology) or the University of Nebraska (Bio-
logical Sciences), dependent on the home institution of
the student's chosen primary advisor. The application
deadlines for all three programs are Dec. 1, 2017. In
addition, to the standard application materials required
by each program, UNVEIL applicants must also submit
a separate Curriculum Vitae and a single page statement
of interest to unveilnet@gmail.com. Statements should

School of Environment and Natural Resources
The Ohio State University
October 2017
The Gray and Pintor Labs at The Ohio State Univer-
sity's School of Environment and Natural Resources
are seeking a PhD student to work on an NSF funded30 EvolDir November 1, 2017
project starting in Autumn 2018 (with the possibility
of a pre-enrollment eld season in Summer 2018). The
project aims to determine the key drivers and functional
signicance of sensory and behavioral trait divergence
in an African cichlid facing human-induced rapid envi-
ronmental change (HIREC). Research in Dr. Suzanne
Gray's lab aims to understand how sh respond to
HIREC, while Dr. Lauren Pintor's lab focuses on the
examining the behavioral mechanisms driving species
interactions in the face of environmental change.
We are seeking highly qualied students with competi-
tive GPA and GRE scores, experience working in aquatic
ecosystems, and who are highly motivated to pursue
an advanced degree in this eld. The successful candi-
date will tackle eld and lab based experiments that
include behavioral and physiological performance tests
of sh from dierent populations that are experiencing
dierent human-induced environmental stressors. In the
laboratory, we conduct long-term rearing experiments to
help disentangle the role of multiple stressors in shaping
divergent sensory and behavioral traits. This means that
the student will be expected to spend up to two months
each year performing eld work in Uganda, Africa, with
the rest of the year based in Columbus, Ohio. Field
work in Uganda can be extremely rewarding but can
also be strenuous: our facilities are very basic (e.g., we
have intermittent electricity and no running water) and
are shared with a number of other researchers.
The School of Environment and Natural Resources
(SENR) is home to ~45 faculty whose specialties range
across several natural and social science disciplines.
Within a framework of interdisciplinarity, our gradu-
ate students take courses that advance their knowledge
within their chosen eld but also introduce them to
diverse elds integral to a holistic understanding of
human-natural coupled systems. Students benet from
bi-weekly seminar speakers across this range of elds,
funds for travel to conferences, access to computer labs
and discipline-specic advanced courses across the Uni-
versity. Columbus is a vibrant and progressive city with
lots to do, great food, access to a series of Metro Parks
and rivers, and an easy drive to Lake Erie in the North
or hiking in Hocking Hills to the south.
Interested students should contact Dr. Suzanne Gray
(gray.1030@osu.edu) and Dr. Lauren Pintor (pin-
tor.6@osu.edu) directly via email, with \Graduate po-

Project description
Climate change has already altered the phenology of
plants and organisms at higher trophic levels. Among
plants, this has resulted in a temporal shift towards
earlier bud burst and/or owering, and among plant-
feeding insects in earlier emergences. But more radical
changes can happen than shifts in phenology: with in-
creasing temperature, species may increase the number
of generations per year (voltinism). Such changes may
be extremely important from an ecological and evolu-
tionary perspective, as an additional generation may
accelerate both population growth and rate of adapta-
tion, and may also lead to temporal mismatches between
interacting species. However, we lack insight in how
climate aects the voltinism of species within natural
multitrophic communities, and how this in turn may
shape food web structure and dynamics.
The overarching aim of the PhD project is to under-
stand how spatial and temporal variation in climate
aects the voltinism of a diverse community of herbi-
vores and parasitoids on oak, and the consequences for
food web structure and dynamics. The project will
combine several approaches: i) elds surveys describ-
ing the spatial and temporal patterns in voltinism of
a community of herbivores and parasitoids on oak, ii)
heating experiments to disentangle how climatic varia-
tion (spring, summer and autumn heating) drives the
voltinism of, and synchrony between, herbivores and
parasitoids, and iii) detailed climate-chamber and lab-
oratory experiments on ve selected species to probe
the impact of voltinism on herbivore and parasitoid
preference and performance.

The Department of Plant Protection is an interdis-

strong research collaboration within and outside the
departmental area (www.slu.se/en/departments/-

conducted in chemical ecology/sensory biology, and
successful research is also conducted in resistance
biology and integrated plant protection. The research
eorts are directed towards both fundamental and
applied research. The Chemical Ecology of Disease
Vectors Group at the Department investigates female
mosquitoes as major vectors of human disease. The
most dangerous of these establish populations in and
around human settlements, and preferentially bite
humans. Mosquitoes nd resources, such as human
hosts and egg-laying sites, by using mainly odour
mediated behaviours. Understanding the genetic causesand eects of resource location and choice in disease
vector mosquitoes is challenging and of signicant
practical importance for controlling these rapidly

peripheral olfactory system with the egg-laying site
preference displayed by the yellow fever mosquito,
Aedes aegypti, using suitable molecular, physiological
and behavioural techniques. Aedes aegypti is a
successful vector of human viral diseases, including
the world's fastest growing transmissible disease,
dengue fever, and the potent, but relative newcomer of
mosquito-borne diseases to the global stage, Zika. The
mosquito's preference for laying eggs and developing
high population densities in human settlements makes
this species both a dangerous disease vector, and a
likely target for control by interfering with females
locating egg-laying sites. In this project, the student
will investigate the mechanism underlying oviposition
site selection by functionally characterising olfactory
receptors with a suspected role in the detection of
odours from egg-laying sites. These ndings will
subsequently be investigated at the receptor neuron
and behavioural levels. Qualications: A master degree,
or similar university higher degree, in molecular biology,
with a keen interest in ecology is required. Knowledge
of chemical ecology, including behavioural assays and
electrophysiology, is highly valued. Experience working
as part of a laboratory research project is preferable.
Good knowledge of spoken and written English is
required. Upper secondary school grades, equivalent
to English B/English 6, are a basic requirement for
be admitted to the PhD education at SLU (proof of
certication will be necessary). Forms for funding or

PhD Graduate Student Positions Available Olson Lab,
Texas Tech University
The Olson lab at Texas Tech University is recruiting
PhD Graduate students interested in the eld of plant
ecological genetics to start in the fall of 2018. Our lab
studies a variety of questions including local adaptation
to latitude in relation to climate change, the evolution
of breeding systems, sex chromosome evolution, and the
evolution of gender dimorphism in plants. We use a
variety of experimental techniques including common38 EvolDir November 1, 2017
garden studies, eld ecology, transmission genetics, ge-
nomics and bioinformatics. For the past decade we have
studied these processes in forest trees and expect that
this will continue to be the main taxonomic focus of our
research.
Our current funding supports research to study the
ecological and genetic factors inuencing the dynamic
movement of sex determination regions and sex chro-
mosome evolution within the Salicaceae (poplars and
willows). The overall project focuses on mapping sex
determination regions from representatives throughout
the family, understanding the genetic basis of gender
dimorphism in defense and pollinator attraction chem-
istry, and the assessment of population genetic patterns
across the sex determination and pseudo-autosomal re-
gions of the sex chromosomes. Graduate students work-
ing on this project will have the opportunity to choose
from a variety of projects including, but not limited
to, mapping the locations of previously unknown sex
determination regions, development of phylogenies for
important plant groups, and studying the evolution of
sexual dimorphism in plant defensive and pollinator at-
traction compounds. Moreover, the grant provides for
a unique multi-institutional and international training
environment, with potential funding to visit labs at the
University of West Virginia, the University of Wisconsin,
Cornell University, and Sichuan University and Nanjing
Forestry University in China for cross-disciplinary train-
ing.
The Olson lab is part of a dynamic Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology group at Texas Tech. Courses and
focused training in ecology, bioinformatics, and genomics
are available from a highly interactive faculty. Texas

Project description: Understanding the forces that
shape global biodiversity patterns was identied as one
of the 25 greatest challenges for Science in the 21st
Century (1, 2). Some mammal clades are enormously di-
verse, while their sister groups (originating at the same
time) are far less so (e.g., 1,500 species of rodents versus
80 species of rabbits, hares and their allies). Why is this,
and what might these dierences tell us about the likely
responses of groups to the present biodiversity crisis?
In this strongly inter-disciplinary project, we will inves-
tigate the possible role of Small Scale Duplications of
genes (SSDs) in shaping patters of diversity, anatomical
complexity (3, 4) and morphological disparity (5-7) of
mammals in deep time. As noted by Ernst Haeckel, de-
velopmental trajectories tend to become more complex
with macroevolutionary time.
Increasing interdependencies between genes and sys-
tems, coupled with their co-option for multiple functions
(pleiotropy), result in more deleterious collateral con-
sequences of mutations. This predicts that aspects of
bodyplan design may become arbitrarily 'locked down'
(e.g., seven neck vertebrae in most mammals), and that
evolutionary innovation will be commonest when ge-
netic redundancy is highest. Small Scale Duplications
of genes (SSDs) increase the number of genes within a
given gene family (gene family size, GFS), and are one
way in which mammals may circumvent such pleiotropic
constraints and facilitate innovation. This project will
use a variety of genomic, phylogenetic palaeontological
and comparative approaches (8) to investigate the rela-
tionship between the timing and phylogenetic placement
of SSDs, the diversity (species richness) and disparity
(morphological diversity) of clades, and the anatomical
complexity (serial dierentiation) of the vertebrae andNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 39
limbs of the species within those clades.
The successful student would join an established re-
search team and will be part of the newly formed Milner
Centre at the University of Bath.
The student should have an interest in evolutionary
genomics.
Experience in statistics and or R or Python scripting
are desirable.

*PhD position (University of Bath, UK): How commu-
nity composition impacts host-parasite coevolution*
Anticipated start date: 1 October 2018
Understanding the fundamental processes and mecha-
nisms that underpin host-parasite coevolution is a major
challenge in evolutionary biology, with signicant impli-
cations for improving disease management strategies and
gaining insights into core biological phenomena. Our
knowledge of co-evolution is largely based on studies
of pairwise interactions, but hosts and parasites do not
exist in isolation; they interact with other potentially
harmful or co-operative species in complex communities.
Yet precisely how the community aects coevolution is
currently unclear.
This project will develop novel theory to understand
how the community aects host-parasite coevolution.
Using mathematical modelling, the student will ad-
dress how the nature of the community (e.g. antag-
onistic/mutualistic) aects the outcome of coevolu-
tion (e.g. directional/uctuating selection, monomor-
phism/polymorphism). The student will also study how
diuse coevolution unfolds when communities consist of
multiple hosts or parasites, and will have the opportu-
nity to test key aspects of the theory using experimental
evolution of microbial communities.
The successful student will have a strong background in
mathematics and a keen interest in modelling biological
systems. Prior laboratory experience would be ideal but
is not required.

The aim of the project is to use genome sequencing
and transcriptome data to characterize the diversity
of sex chromosome systems found in the stickleback
family to address the following questions: (1) What
factors are associated with the transition between ho-
momorphic and heteromorphic sex chromosomes?; (2)
What mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of
gene dosage on degenerate sex chromosomes?; (3) Do
Y and W chromosomes have dierent evolutionary tra-
jectories? The Division of Evolutionary Ecology is a
dynamic and interdisciplinary group. We are part of
the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University
of Bern in Switzerland. The Institute currently has six
research divisions spanning a broad range of research
in ecology and evolution including conservation biology,
community ecology, behavioural ecology, population and
evolutionary genomics, and mechanisms of adaptation
and speciation. We host a large international community
of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.
Candidates must be highly motivated and creative, able
to work independently and collaboratively, have a strong
background in evolutionary genetics, and have prior ex-
perience with the analyses of large genomic datasets.
Previous experience with molecular cytogenetic meth-
ods is a plus. The working language of our division is
English.
The starting date for the PhD student is as early asJanuary 2018. A masters degree is required to apply.
Starting salary is 47,000 CHF and includes social secu-
rity contributions.
Please submit your application via email by 30
November 2017 to Prof. Catherine Peichel: cather-
ine.peichel@iee.unibe.ch Applicants must submit one
merged PDF le that includes a letter of motivation, a
CV, names of two referees who should have sent their
recommendation letter separately by email before the
deadline, and copies of relevant publications and/or

The Mazer lab in the Department of Ecology, Evolu-
tion and Marine Biology at the University of California,
Santa Barbara is recruiting one or two highly motivated
PhD students (for entry into our graduate program in
Fall 2018) to conduct both collaborative and indepen-
dent research to investigate the process and outcome
of adaptive evolution within and among populations of
the annual forb, Nemophila menziesii (Baby Blue Eyes,
Boraginaceae).
Successful candidates will participate in a recently
funded NSF grant (Evolutionary adaptation to intensi-
fying drought across a geographic gradient: a compre-
hensive evaluation of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem
with Dr. Amber Nashoba and Dr. Ruth Shaw) in which
we are using quantitative genetic methods to test pre-
dictions derived from Fishers Fundamental Theorem in
wild populations of N. menziesii distributed across an
aridity gradient in California. Incoming students will
also be expected to develop and to conduct independentresearch that extends beyond the scope of the research
supported by this grant. Promising areas of research
include (but are not restricted to):
(a) the ecological and evolutionary signicance of varia-
tion within and among populations in prospective tness-
related traits such as germination responses, owering
time, ower size, herkogamy and dichogamy, pollen per-
formance, seed size, and sex allocation;
(b) pre- and post-pollination sexual selection on primary
and secondary sexual traits;
(c) the functional signicance of variation in o-
ral and vegetative pigments, including UV re-
ectance/absorption;
(d) the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in life history
and morphological traits; and
(e) the causes and consequences of variation in water
use eciency across an aridity gradient.
Funding packages oered to highly competitive candi-
dates will include a combination of Graduate Research
assistantships, Teaching Assistantships, Block Grants,
and UCSB-funded graduate fellowships. Students who
have already earned a Masters degree in Botany, Evo-
lution, or Plant Ecology, or who have applied for a

ing Group \Biological responses to novel and changing
environments 'V RESPONSE" (RTG 2010), funded by
the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), invites
applications for 12 PhD positions (salary scale TV-L
E13, 65%; including social benets) for a three year
structured Ph.D. program. Start of the Ph.D. positions
will be obligatory April 1st, 2018. The RTG is based
at the Univ. of Greifswald, Germany (for details see:
www.uni-greifswald.de/RESPONSE).
Research Program
The ability to respond to novel and changing environ-
mental conditions, either by phenotypic plasticity, ge-
netic adaptation, or range shifts, is pivotal to the longer-
term survival of all organisms. Owing to increasing con-
cerns about the consequences of human-induced global
change, such responses have attracted increasing interest
in recent years. RESPONSE focuses on the plastic and
genetic capacities for in situ responses (cluster A) and
on the factors limiting or facilitating dispersal to new
habitats (cluster B). The RTG aims at deepening our
understanding of the limits to population persistence,
enabling more accurate predictions regarding the fate
of populations under changing conditions. Our research
program spans dierent levels of biological organization,
ranging from molecular and physiological mechanisms
to ecological population-level responses, and a wide
variety of organisms including lichens, myxomycetes,
plants (trees), and animals (snails, crustaceans, insects,
spiders, bats). Please refer to www.uni-greifswald.de/-
RESPONSE for further information, especially on the
available individual research (PhD) projects and specic
requirements. Note that all projects involve eld work
at least to some extent.
Teaching Concept
A teaching program accompanies the interdisciplinary
research strategy. It covers dierent scientic topics
and techniques relevant to the RTG as well as soft skills
relevant to career development, and includes summer
schools, journal clubs, practical courses, lectures, and in-
dividualized educational as well as mentoring programs.
Each PhD project involves visiting stays at dierent
laboratories, partly abroad. The participation in the
teaching program is mandatory.November 1, 2017 EvolDir 45
Requirements

TemperatureAndReproduction
PhD position: Reproduction in a changing world I invite
applications for a PhD position in the research group
of Dr. Claudia Fricke (http://ieb.uni-muenster.de/-
evolseco) at the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity
at the University of Muenster in Germany.
The start date will be as soon as possible, the latest
January 2018.
We study the evolution of sexual traits and within this
project the interested candidate will study the eects
of temperature on male and female reproduction. High
temperatures particularly aects male reproductive suc-
cess and we want to understand the underlying molecular
changes that lead to the temperature sensitivity of male
fertility.
Using experimental evolution the aim is to test whether
this temperature sensitivity can evolve and males re-
main fertile even at elevated temperatures. This will
give insight whether adaption to novel temperature envi-
ronments is possible or whether a constraint will possibly
limit species persistence through a reduce ability to re-
produce. For this research work the successful candidate
will work with the fruit y Drosophila melanogaster,
which is a widely used model organism. This project
will combine behavioural and tness assays with molec-
ular work and an experimental evolution approach to
gain more insight into the ecology of reproduction.
WWU is a large vibrant university hosting a num-
ber of excellent scientic institutions (http://www.uni-
muenster.de/en/). The Institute for Evolution and Bi-
ology provides a stimulating research environment with
a number of scientic groups researching on diverse

PhD position in the project \Macroecology and diver-
sity of species interactions" at the University of Oulu,
Finland.
Coevolution among species via species interactions is
the major driving force of biodiversity. Yet, the con-
cept of and metrics to estimate species interactions is
largely missing from biodiversity studies. The project
has two major aims. First, our goal is to create a novel
community diversity index, which quantitatively grade
communities in terms of the sign, strength and variation
of interactions. We will then examine how interaction
index varies relative to taxonomic, phylogenetic and
functional diversity, stability of the communities and
the level of disturbance. Second, we aim to estimate
a novel species-specic characteristic, which describes
species competitive - facilitative interaction abilities.
The association of this new metric with species capabil-
ity to adapt to global changes is then examined. The
data to be used in the project is negotiable; compre-
hensive and long-term bird survey data from Europe
and moth data from Finland are available. We will use
a state-of-the-art statistical modelling technique, Joint
Dynamic Species Distribution Modelling, developed by
one of the PIs of the project, Dr. James Thorson, in
extracting species associations from the survey data.
The position is for 4 years. The start date of the po-
sition is January 2018, with some exibility. We aim
that the chosen candidate will spend 6-12 months at
the University of Washington (Seattle, USA) and learn
modeling techniques with Dr. Thorson. Funding for
the visit will be applied from various sources, such as
Fulbright Center. Position involves occasional teaching.
The location of the position is at the Research Unit
of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oulu, Finland.
Salary is based on the University salary system. Start-

PhD Fellowship in Macroevolution/Paleobiology/Fishes
at the University of Pennsylvania
A PhD fellowship in Paleobiology is available in the
Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the
University of Pennsylvania, starting in Fall 2018. Prof.
Lauren Sallan seeks a graduate student to address major
questions about evolution using the fossil record. These
include: how global change has aected life over time,
how life evolves at high levels (macroevolution), how
ecology shapes evolution long-term, the relationships of
living and dead animals (phylogeny), and the origins
of living biodiversity. While research in the lab has
focused on shes, any suitable group of fossils may be
used. Potential thesis topics include, but are not limited
to: the long-term eects of mass extinctions (e.g. the
end-Devonian and end-Ordovician), the roles of preda-
tion and competition in marine ecosystem evolution,
ecological characteristics of evolutionary radiations past
and present, the eects of long-term climate and envi-
ronmental changes (e.g. the Late Paleozoic Ice Age) on
biodiversity, and major transitions in early vertebrateevolution (e.g. origin of jaws, invasion of land). The stu-
dent can also develop a novel project that addresses sim-
ilar questions using quantitative, phylogenetic and/or
descriptive methods.
This is fully-funded fellowship with stipend and tu-
ition support guaranteed for the length of the PhD.
Applicants are encouraged to contact Prof. Sallan
(lsallan@upenn.edu) for more details. Additional in-
formation on the fellowship is available on the depart-
mental website: www.sas.upenn.edu/earth. Applica-
tions for entry in Fall 2018 are due January 15, 2018,

UppsalaU HumanEvolGenetics
PhD position in human population genetics of African
populations: A PhD position in the eld of human
evolutionary genetics is available at the Department of
Organismal Biology, Uppsala University (Sweden).
The PhD position will be situated in the group of
Dr. Carina Schlebusch within the Human Evolution
sub-Program at the Department of Organismal Biol-
ogy (Evolutionary Biology Center, Uppsala University).
The Schlebusch group is specically interested in study-
ing human history on the African continent and uses
genetic data from modern day populations and an-
cient remains as a tool for the inference of African
history. The Human Evolution sub-Program, in which
the Schlebusch group is situated, has a broad interest
in population genetics and human evolution. There
are ample opportunities to work closely with post-
docs and other PhD students that focus on related
projects. The research environment is international
with English being the working language. See Dr. Schle-
busch web-page for more information on research and
recent publications (http://www.iob.uu.se/research/-
evolution-and-development/schlebusch/) and Human
Evolution sub-Program web-page for more informa-
tion on the Program (http://www.iob.uu.se/research/-
evolution-and-development/human-evolution/).
Project description: The spread of farming practices
has had a marked inuence on how humans are dis-
tributed around the globe today. Inferences about the
spread of farming in Africa are mostly based on lin-
guistic and archeological studies. Genome-wide studies
started to make a contribution to research on the his-
tory of African farmers but many populations remain
poorly represented, making detailed inferences problem-
atic. The present study proposes to investigate spread
of farming in Sub-Saharan Africa. The successful candi-
date will use genomic data (from current day popula-
tions and ancient remains) to infer to what extent the
spread of farming to the various parts of the African
continent, were driven by migrating people, where the
people originated from, which routes were followed and
the timeframe of the migrations.
Qualications: A Masters degree (or equivalent) in a
relevant eld is required. The ideal candidate is highly
motivated with thorough education and strong interest
in evolutionary genetics/genomics, population genet-ics and human evolution. Previous experience with
large-scale genetic data analysis, bioinformatics, and
programming is advantageous. Mathematical, compu-
tational and statistical training is also advantageous.
Field work experience (especially in Africa) and an inter-
est/background in African history is also advantageous.
Candidates must be uent in English.
How to apply: The application should include a letter
of intent describing yourself and your research interests.
The application should also include a CV, copy of mas-
ter degree diploma and course grades, master thesis and
other relevant documents.
The position: The PhD student position is for four
years. The position can be combined with teaching
(up to 20%) that will extend the position with a cor-
responding amount of time. More information about
postgraduate studies at Uppsala University is available

SpeciationGenomics
Dear Evoldir,
We are currently looking for applicants for a PhD
based partly at the University of Southampton and
partly at the NHM, London. Please do contact
myself (M.Chapman@soton.ac.uk) or Mark Carine
(M.Carine@nhm.ac.uk) if you have any questions. Pass
on to potential students if you know of some. Appli-
cation deadline is 5th January with interviews in late
February/early March.
This project will analyse speciation genomics in a plant
genus found throughout the Canary Islands in a wide va-
riety of habitats. Several species are endemics, showing
ecological speciation (the origin of species by adapta-
tion to novel environments) within and between islands.
A reference genome is being assembled and annotated
and the SPITFIRE project will generate and analyse
sequencing data from multiple individuals of all the
endemic species.
Specic objectives: 1. Phylogenetic analyses of the
dynamics of speciation, including the role of introgres-
sion in speciation. 2. Measuring divergent adaptation
between species through a reciprocal transplant experi-
ment on Tenerife. 3. Identication of candidate genes
underlying ecological speciation. 4. Determining the
function of a subset of these candidate genes using trans-
genics.

more information (note the nationality requirements,
funding situation and other requirements) please take a

EvolutionaryGenetics
PhD position in evolutionary genetics. Universities of
St Andrews and Edinburgh, Scotland.
Species grow distinct and adapt to new environments
by divergent selection and genetic drift. Detecting and
distinguishing selection and drift in genome scale data is
challenging and complicated by confounding processes
such as gene ow and demographic history. Advances in
the availability and methods for the analysis of genomes
potentially allow us to reconstruct species evolution with
unprecedented resolution. Much new data is emerging
on patterns of genomic divergence both within and be-
tween species, and debates over the causes of genomic
divergence are a major issue in comparative genomics.
This project will examine patterns of genomic diver-
gence in one of the best understood of all organisms, the
fruit y Drosophila. Genome scale data will be compiled
in combination with data on the extent of evolutionary
divergence in a range of key traits. These include species
distributions, ecology, mating system and the extent of
pre- and post-mating reproductive isolation between
species. The data will come from both published and
novel genome sequences and detailed compilations of the
strength of dierent types of reproductive isolation and
ecology exist. The student will integrate this database
and use new analytical techniques to accurately quantify
genetic divergence and gene ow (inferred as migration
rate across dierent genomic regions). New approaches
to outstanding questions in evolutionary divergence can
be asked such as; do similar patterns of genomic diver-
gence correlate with sexual or post-mating isolation?
Do both inuence sex-chromosomes versus autosome
divergence similarly? Do ecological generalists show
dierent patterns of genomic divergence from special-
ists? Do patterns of divergence dier between sympatry
and allopatry, and how often do we detect gene ow in
sympatric species?
The student will be based at the University of St An-
drews and collaborate with a co-supervisor at the Uni-versity of Edinburgh. The lead supervisor (Mike Ritchie,
St Andrews) brings extensive experience of speciation
in Drosophila and the co-supervisor (Konrad Lohse,
Edinburgh) is developing new statistical approaches to
the analysis of genome scale data. This 3.5-year stu-
dentship (stipend and fees) will be provided at UK/EU
citizen rates. International students may apply but will
be responsible for the dierence in fees; a fee waiver
scholarship may be available for outstanding candidates.
Enquiries from Chinese nationals are welcomed as the
University of St Andrews has additional funding oppor-
tunities for Chinese students.
The student will receive advanced training in evolu-
tionary biology, genomic analysis, bioinformatics and
biostatistics, and some experience with bioinformatics
is desired. A relevant BSc is required, and an MSc is a
potential advantage.

Uvienna 2 CephalopodEvolution
Department of Molecular Evolution and Development,
University of Vienna, is looking for two enthusiastic PhD
students with background or interest in evolutionary
biology to investigate the molecular basis behind ancient
transitions in metazoan genome architecture with a spe-
cial focus on cephalopods. Coleoid cephalopods (octo-
pus, squid, cuttlesh) have large, complex genomes. The
regulatory landscape required to establish their complex
nervous system and development remains elusive. One of
the research directions in our group focuses on applying
methods of functional genomics to study genome regula-
tion and its evolution in the emerging small cephalopod
model species Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail
squid). We are also generally interested in the mecha-
nisms of genome architecture evolution across metazoans
with a special interest in the impact of repetitive ele-
ments in large genomes. The candidates are desired to
have previous experience with experimental molecular
approaches and/or bioinformatic tools in those topics.
The positions are funded by a grant from the Austrian
Science Fund and run for three years with a possibility
of extension to four years.
The work will be integrated and highly collaborative
with several groups at the University of Vienna and
the Center for Organismal Systems Biology, in par-
ticular the Departments of Molecular Evolution and
Development, Integrative Zoology, and Neurobiology,
as well as other research institutes. Additionally, the
students, depending on the project focus, can be associ-
ated with either one of the two Vienna Doctoral Schools
\Molecules of Life" and \Cognition, Behavior and Neu-
roscience". Vienna is an internationally-renowned hub
for evolutionary biology with over 50 research groups in
the Vienna Evolutionary Biology network (evolVienna).
The city harbors several Universities and Research In-
stitutes for biological and biomedical research with a
vibrant academic environment. Vienna is a vibrant
historic European capital with a high QOL.
Please send your CV, letter of motivation, MSc (or equiv-
alent certicate) and at least two reference letters (or
contacts) latest by Dec 1st directly to: Oleg Simakov (

\The role of symbiont community diversity for the
rhizobia-legume symbiosis"
Link: https://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=89673&LID=1597
Description: Microbes are powerful things. This
is particularly true for those engaged in intimate symbi-
otic interactions with other organisms. The relationship
between Rhizobia and legumes, for example, plays a
critical role in plant productivity in both natural and
agricultural environments. Rhizobia x atmospheric
nitrogen and exchange this for sugars with their legume
hosts, a relationship that accounts for ~50% of biological
nitrogen xation in agricultural systems. In agriculture,
extensive use of man-made mineral fertilisers has
become unsustainable, damaging soils and contributing
signicantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Harnessing
natural processes like the rhizobia-legume interaction
has the potential to be a major step towards more
sustainable agricultural practice, however, research
into the ecology and evolution of these interactions is
required.
Research into this interaction has typically focused on
pairwise interactions between two genotypes. Yet, we
know that plants typically form associations with multi-
ple rhizobia genotypes simultaneously. At present, the
relationship between symbiont communities and plant
productivity is poorly understood. With this project, we
will investigate the impact of rhizobia symbiont diversity
on the establishment, resilience and productivity of this
important host-microbe symbiosis. We will combine con-
trolled lab and greenhouse experiments to estimate the
relationship between rhizobia diversity and symbiotic
performance and identify the drivers of this relationship.
We will examine the impact of diversity both on short
(ecological) and long (evolutionary) timescales to inves-November 1, 2017 EvolDir 63
tigate the impact of symbiont diversity on community
stability over multiple host plant generations. Finally,
we will work with industrial partners to develop and test
the eectiveness of multi-strain inocula as a commercial
application.
This project will draw on community ecology and biodi-
versity theory as well as host-microbe interactions and
rapid bacterial evolution. You will have the opportunity
to develop expertise in microbiology, experimental evolu-
tion, microbial ecology, plant biology and hypothesis-led
experimental design. You will also have access to an
extensive and fully sequenced strain collection to learn
and develop bioinformatics and statistical skills as well
as an opportunity to use cutting edge research facili-
ties at both the universities of York and Sheeld. You
will be supported and encouraged to develop your own
ideas and hypotheses and will be part of larger research
groups in both universities.
As this is an interdisciplinary project ideal candidates
will have a background in or a demonstrated interest in
at least one of the main subject areas - e.g. microbiology,
community ecology, agricultural sustainability - and be
willing to develop skills in the other areas.
Funding: This is a NERC ACCE DTP studentship fully
funded for 3.5 years and covers: (i) a tax-free stipend
at the standard Research Council rate (estimated to
be 14,533 for 2017-2018), (ii) research costs, and (iii)
tuition fees at the UK/EU rate.

*PhD Position in Evolutionary Ecology*
**
*On: Demographic and evolutionary modelling of local
adaptation to the tidal environment in /Clunio mari-
nus/*
**
*at the University of Zurich, Switzerland*
**
A PhD position in evolutionary ecology, of 48 months du-
ration, is available at the University of Zurich working
with Prof Hanna Kokko and her international team
www.kokkonuts.org . /Clunio marinus/is a marine
midge that has a unique life history, living in the in-tertidal zone of the European Atlantic coast. Local
adaptation is important, as the timing of low tides dif-
fers across coastal locations. Populations indeed dier
in their lunar and diurnal rhythms of adult emergence,
and the dierences are genetic (as known from past
crossing experiments and through genomic work by Dr.
Tobias Kaiser).
This project, which forms a collaboration between Dr.
Kaiser's group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on and Prof. Kokko's group at the
University of Zurich, aims to ll in a knowledge gap
considering the evolutionary demography of the species:
how is local adaptation maintained, given the dierent
dispersal options leading to dierent genotypes mating,
potentially producing maladapted emergence times with
respect to seasonal phenology and/or lunar cycles?
The ideal candidate has a grasp of demographic and/or
evolutionary modelling, and a willingness to develop
his/her skills further in this regard. The PhD will be
awarded by the University of Zurich, which is also the
main location of the student's work, but the project also
involves visits to Pl on and the potentially many coastal
eld sites.
The working language in the group is English (German
skills are not essential). The position is available as
soon as the candidate has been found. The evaluation
of applications begins on October 18, 2017, and will
continue until a suitable candidate has been found.
Applicants should send a cover letter with a
-Statement of their research interests
-C.V., and
-The names and contact details of at least one referee.
Applications should form a single pdf le and this should
be sent to: hanna.kokko@ieu.uzh.ch

TechAssist AvianEvolution
The Max Planck Institute for Ornithology is an interna-
tionally oriented research institute dealing mainly with
the elds of behavioral neurobiology, behavioral ecol-
ogy, evolutionary biology, immunoecology and animal
migration. The research group of Dr. Aplin at the Max
Planck Institute for Ornithology (Radolfzell, Germany)
is looking for a Biological technical assistant (10/17) in
part time (75%) or full time. The position is to assist in
research of the ecology and evolution of social behaviour
and cognition in birds, helping with a variety of tasks
including captive experiments and eldwork.
Main tasks:
The technical assistant will be an integral part of the
lab group, supporting the research by carrying out a
range of tasks related to animal handling, data manage-
ment and data collection. First, they will assist in lab
organization, helping with the construction and mainte-
nance of technical equipment, as well as data entry and
management. Second, they will assist with animal han-
dling/observation in the aviary complex and laboratory
at the institute. Third, they will help with observation
and monitoring of wild birds. This will primarily involve
monitoring a breeding population of tits (Parus major,
Cyanistes caeruleus) located around the institute: catch-
ing, tagging and taking measurements on birds. The
technical assistant may also potentially assist in other
eldwork projects, including on wild parrots, and will
have the opportunity to engage with public outreach.November 1, 2017 EvolDir 75
Requirements:
Applicants should have a degree in a relevant subject.
Ideally candidates will also have (or will shortly have)
a Master's degree in Biological Sciences or completed
training as a biochemical assistant. Previous experi-
ence in scientic work is desirable. The project will
involve capture and handling of wild birds, and experi-
ence in bird ringing is an absolute must. The work will
involve creative engineering, electronics and hardware
construction, and so while previous experience is not
necessary, an interest in electronics or programming is
of advantage.
We are looking for candidates who are pro-active, re-
sponsible and reliable, with good time management and
the ability to work in a team. The work will occasionally
involve unusual hours, physically demanding eldwork
and creative problem solving, and so the ability to thrive
in this environment is vital. An interest in science and
the scientic process is an advantage, and there will be
lots of opportunity for the candidate to be involved in
active research. Prociency in German is required. How-
ever, the working language of the lab-group is English,
and so English language skills are highly desirable.
The starting date will be early 2018, ideally in January,
but no later than 30th March. The position is initially
planned for two years and can be extended up to ve
years subject to satisfactory performance.
The remuneration is paid according to the collective
agreement of the public service TVoD according to the
qualication and the activity to be transferred, either
part time or full time.
The Max-Planck society is committed to increasing the
number of individuals with disabilities in its workforce
and therefore encourages applications from such quali-
ed individuals.

Note that even though the listing does not mention evo-
lution, candidates asking evolutionary questions about
the physiology of plants stress resistance are encouraged
to apply. Also, while the mission of the PRI is focused on
crop plants, research using non-crop species to address
questions of relevance to agriculture is appropriate.
Three Faculty Positions in Plant Resilience The depart-
ments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Horticul-
ture, and Plant Biology in collaboration with the newly
created Plant Resilience Institute at Michigan State
University are inviting applications for three tenure-

resilience with the goal of improving the productivity
and nutritional quality of agronomic and horticultural
crops. Research programs center on mechanisms that
enhance plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses
associated with changing environmental conditions. The
PRI is an interdisciplinary cross-departmental program,
with PRI members belonging to a range of home depart-
ments. The following academic departments are inviting
applications from individuals working on various aspects
of plant resilience.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT - Schistosome Parasite Evo-
lution. We are searching for an enthusiastic Research
Assistant to conduct laboratory experiments with para-
sitic blood ukes (schistosomes) that are the causative
agents of schistosomiasis. These parasites, which re-
quire both aquatic snail intermediate and vertebrate
denitive hosts, infect over 200 million people world-
wide and kill an estimated 200,000 people each year.
As schistosomes can be maintained in the laboratory,
they also provide an excellent system for investigating
parasite co-evolution with the host snail, and evolution
of drug resistance. The successful candidate will play
a critical role in a dynamic research team examining
the genetic basis and evolution of parasite virulence,
drug resistance, and host specicity in this important
parasite. The research project will require excellent or-

involve maintenance of the schistosome parasite lifecycle
in snails and rodents in the laboratory. The successful
candidate will report to Dr. Tim Anderson, and will
work under the direct guidance of Dr. Winka Le Clec'h
and Dr. Fr ed eric Chevalier.

diverse expertise. The current research projects within
CMCI are numerous and diverse. These are formalized
as CMCI Working Groups, which include faculty, post-
doctoral and student modelers and empiricists. These
grassroots groups create a powerful feedback between
theory, empirical work, and analysis. Some current
examples include using molecular modeling to predict
immune escape mutations and spectral shifts in opsin
proteins; studying the pathogenic eects of viral co-
infection in Drosophila and mice; modeling how human
social dynamics such as attitudes toward vaccination
generate feedbacks with disease dynamics; using micro-
biome data to model population dynamics of microbial
communities; and modeling the reproducibility crisis in
science. Successful candidates will have an opportunity

JaniceBritton-Davidian1950-2017
Janice Britton-Davidian 1950-2017
Janice Britton-Davidian passed away on 02 August 2017,
after having fought with an admirable courage against
an aggressive cancer. She was 66.
After an early education in Mexico and a bachelor of
arts in languages and literature obtained while at the
university of Texas Austin, she moved to Montpellier to
specialize in animal biology in 1975. She did a PhD in
population genetics under the supervision of a paleon-
tologist, Louis Thaler, and participated to the building
of the rst French Institute for Evolutionary Sciences
(Institut des Sciences de l ^A1Evolution de Montpellier,
ISEM). She contributed to the development of the ge-
netic pole of the ISEM by rst, in her early career,
pioneering the use of allozyme markers (with Nicole
Pasteur) to the understanding of population genetics
and systematics of animal species. Mentored by Louis
Thaler, she contributed to the renewal of the taxonomy
of mice by reinstating Mus spretus as a good species in
the mid-1970s, kicking o decades of evolutionary stud-
ies on genus Mus in Montpellier. Bringing her expertise
as a population geneticist to a multi-disciplinary group
of evolutionary biologists, she has been instrumental
for the success of this Institute, and the development
of Montpellier evolutionary community, which rapidly
became a leading European center in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy.
She then gradually specialized on mice and moved to the
study of chromosome evolution and its role in speciation
becoming a leading scientist in this eld of research.
Although she did all her career in the ISEM, she en-
gaged in active and enriching reciprocal exchanges with
colleagues in France and abroad (from Berkeley (USA),
Stellenbosch (South Africa) to Monastir (Tunisia) and
Lisbon (Portugal), which led to fruitful collaborations,
exciting projects and results, and training programs
inspiring several generations of students and researchers.
She was passionate and dedicated, and anyone thatworked with her was impressed by the intensity of her
commitment to science.
Her work on chromosomal evolution left an indelible
imprint in the elds of cytogenetics and evolutionary
genetics and has greatly contributed to our current un-
derstanding of the role of chromosomal evolution in
adaptation, speciation and genome evolution.
It is hard to reduce Janice ^A1s career to a few achieve-
ments. But her work on Robertsonian fusions in popu-
lations of the house mouse made a major contribution
to the understanding of the origins and evolutionary
consequences of chromosomal rearrangements. Over her
vast scientic career, there has been a gradual shift from
Patterns to Processes, nourished by her innite scientic
curiosity. Among other ndings, she described several
Robertsonian systems (populations of wild mice with
less than 40 chromosomes due to centric fusions), in
particular the one on Madeira Island. She studied the
eects of these chromosomal rearrangements on recom-
bination rates, on gene ow, and on speciation processes.
More recently, she also investigated the structures and
compositions of the centromeres, and their contribution
to genome reorganization. In parallel, she discovered the
unusual sex determination system of the African pygmy
mouse, where most of the females are sex-reversed, i.e.,
XY, due to a third feminizing sex chromosome.
Despite her recent retirement and the serious health
issues, she remained active and involved until the end,
keeping coming to the lab and working on scientic
drafts between two chemotherapies. The last paper that
she wrote was accepted last June in Biol J Linnean Soc
^A3Does chromosomal change restrict gene ow between
house mouse populations? Evidence from microsatellite
polymorphisms ^A2
Janice was a great scientist and a remarkable woman.
She was an endearing, genuinely generous, and always
enthusiastic person. Janice will be remembered for her
sense of humor, the seless support she gave to her
colleagues and students, and her involvement at the
collective level. She was discreet by nature, but any-
where she went, she left an incredible souvenir of an
absolutely unique, lovely, deeply friendly, and inspiring
person. Those who have had the unique privilege of
knowing her personally, working with her, and learning
from her, feel the void she left behind. But many of us
follow in her footsteps and perpetuate her passion for
evolution and chromosomes.
She will be sorely missed, more than words can say.

Panama InternStipend
PhylogeneticsBiodiversityEvolution
THIS IS AN URGENT AD. A SUITABLE CANDI-
DATE IS NEEDED BY MONDAY 16/10/2017.
Project: What causes the high biodiversity of the
Neotropics? A systematic analysis.
Opportunity: an intern is needed to be trained in meta-
analysis of literature, databases and analysis of data
on Neotropical biodiversity. The intern will live in the
rainforest in Panama and study at the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute, a globally leading centre
for the study of tropical environments (stri.si.edu).
Research: Neotropics are the most biodiverse area of
the planet. What factors have contributed to the ex-ceptional richness of life in the region? Hundreds of
studies attempt to answer this question for individual
taxa, from mammals through trees to butteries. A
meta-analysis of results from separate studies of many
groups is needed to capture the general trends. The in-
tern will be trained to compile and analyse information
from published studies. The intern will explore several
taxonomic groups, and learn critical review of scientic
literature, collection of data from public repositories,
and complex quantitative analysis. Skills acquired in
this project can be widely applied in biodiversity con-
servation, bioinformatics and comparative biology. The
question of diversity in the Neotropics remains a great
enigma of biology 'V the intern will have a chance to
develop their own answers.
Time and place: 3 months, early 2018; STRI facility
in Gamboa, Panama, a pleasant village halfway up the
Panama Canal in the Soberania National Park. In their
free time the intern can enjoy the spectacular outdoors,
Caribbean and Pacic beaches, or the booming Panama
City. STRI is also an excellent place to nd other op-
portunities for eldwork, graduate school, etc. The
intern will be welcome to join occasional entomological
excursions.
Cost: A stipend to cover living costs is oered. The
intern needs to pay for a ight to Panama.
Requirements: Current undergraduates or recent gradu-
ates only.
Required: very good English; strong interest in bio-
geography, ecology and evolution; willingness to learn
quantitative methods.
Useful: programming skills (e.g. R, python, SQL); fa-
miliarity with statistics, modelling, etc. No Spanish
needed.
Application: contact Dr Chris Kozak urgently
(kmkozak87@gmail.com; Skype: kmkozak).
Interns are selected in a competition: the candidate will
have to submit an application early next week (around
Monday 16/10/17). Application includes a letter of
intent, transcripts and a recommendation.

Phylogenetic Networks: From Displayed Trees to a Dis-
tribution of Gene Trees Luay Nakhleh Rice University
Friday, October 27, 2017, 9:00 AM PDT
Phylogenetic networks are leaf-labeled, rooted, directed
acyclic graphs that are used to represent and model
reticulate, or non-treelike, evolutionary histories. Phy-
logenetic networks have received signicant attention
in the last two or three decades and the computational
phylogenetics community has developed a wide array
of mathematical results and algorithmic techniques for
their inference. A fundamental observation that guided
much of these developments was that a network is a
summary of a set of trees. This observation gave rise to
the parsimonious formulation of inferring a network with
the smallest number of non-tree events that displays a
given set of trees.
More recently, though, eorts have been dedicated to sta-
tistical inference of these networks from data of multiple,
unlinked loci. This formulation is based on extendingthe multi-species coalescent to species phylogenies whose
topologies are networks. With this extension, inferences
simultaneously account for reticulation events, such as
hybridization, in the presence of incomplete lineage sort-
ing, thus not interpreting all heterogeneity in the data
as caused solely by reticulation.
In this seminar, I will introduce the phylogenetic net-
work model, and give a brief survey of the results based
on the parsimonious formulation. I will then introduce
the multispecies network coalescent and describe recent
results on statistical inference of phylogenetic networks
from multi-locus data under this model.

STEM survey
Dear all, We are seeking participation - please - from
Early Career Scientists, within a maximum of ten years
of completing their doctorate, in the evolutionary biol-
ogy community and aliated disciplines.
In recent years the academic community has made great
progress in addressing the historic under-representation
of women in Science Technology Engineering and Math-
ematics (STEM). What has received less attention are
the minorities identifying with other protected char-
acteristics. Protected groups are identied in the UK
Equality Act 2010 as sharing a particular characteris-
tic against which it is illegal to discriminate, such as
race/ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation (see here
for details<https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-
rights>). There has been very little discussion with
regards the eect of coming from a protected group, de-
spite evidence that this can have a strong eect on the
probability of retaining an academic career. We wish to
explore some of the challenges faced by scientists who
do not come from a 'traditional' background, and how
some of these challenges can be overcome. Our aim is an
Open Access publication that we hope will be of benet
to all in our community. The study will take no more
than 20 minutes of your time, and can be found here:
https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SH53LZ5. Further
information can be found on the rst page of the survey.November 1, 2017 EvolDir 113

WilliamsC Trinidad Internship
GuppyEvolution
Dear Brian,
Would you mind posting this job ad under the \jobs"
category please.
Research Internships. The Guppy Project
Research interns are needed to assist in a multi-
disciplinary, multi-investigator, experimental study of
the interactions between ecology and evolution in
Trinidad, West Indies. The research is led by Professor
David Reznick at the University of California, Riverside
in collaboration with Joseph Travis (Florida State), Tim
Coulson (Oxford), Paul Bentzen (Dalhousie U.), and
Ron Bassar (Williams). We seek to integrate multiple
biological elds for the study of these interactions in
experimental populations of guppies in Trinidad. Duties
include assisting in monthly censuses of guppy popula-
tions in montane streams. The monthly censuses include
long hours in the eld and laboratory. There will also
be 12 days o between each census when interns can
pursue an independent project.
Qualications: We seek interns who are entertaining the
possibility of pursuing graduate studies in some area
of ecology and evolution and who wish to gain some
additional eld research experience before doing so. Re-
search will take place in semi-remote areas of Trinidad114 EvolDir November 1, 2017
sometimes under bad weather conditions. Applicants
must be able to live and work well with others. Research
will involve carrying heavy packs over slippery and steep
terrain. Applicants must be in good physical condition
and be able to meet the demands of eld research under
these conditions. Ability to drive a standard transmis-
sion vehicle is desirable but not required. Applicants
with rst-aid/rst responder training, skills in auto-
mobile maintenance, and construction skills are highly
desirable. Please address these skills when applying.
Interns will be required to spend a minimum of 3-months
in Trinidad, with possibility of extension. Starting dates
are as early as January 2018. We will cover all travel
and living expenses and provide housing.
Please see our website <www.theguppyproject.weebly.com >for more in-
formation on the project and access to reprints. Our
video menu includes a \guppy censuses" submenu that
details the main tasks associated with the internship.
Applicants should send cover letter, CV and the names
and e-mail addresses of three or more professional refer-
ences to David Reznick (gupy@ucr.edu). At least two
of the references should be academics.

Postdoctoral Research Position in Evolutionary Ecology
A Postdoctoral Research Associate position is available
in the Warner Lab at Auburn University. The success-
ful candidate will be involved primarily with research
on developmental plasticity and population biology of
brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei). The Warner Lab has
generated a large dataset from a 7-year mark-recapture
study on 3-6 island populations (data on ~20,000 in-
dividuals) of brown anoles. The successful candidate
will be expected to work with this dataset to explore
a variety of questions about (but not limited to) spa-
tial and temporal variation in population demographics,
phenotypic selection, and habitat use. The post-doc will
also be involved with research on the ecology and evolu-

INRA France PopGenHybridization
Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Population Genetics,
INRA, Saint-P ee-sur-Nivelle, France.
A postdoctoral research assistant position in population
genetics is available at the Joint Research Unit ECO-
BIOP Fish Behavioural Ecology and Population Biology
(INRA - Univ. Pau & Pays Adour).
Project description: Hybridization is a natural biological
process encountered in evolutionary history of numerous
taxa but can also have more recent origin in the case ofanthropogenic perturbations leading to the loss of repro-
ductive isolation between species. Estimating the rela-
tive importance of these dierent factors is paramount
in the case of hybridization involving declining species
to evaluate the potential impact of hybridization in
the demographic trajectory of species at risk and to
understand factors leading to hybridization to better
inform management policies. The research subject of
the recruited postdoctoral research assistant will be to
study hybridization dynamics between the allis shad
(Alosa alosa) and the twait shad (Alosa fallax) within a
research project aiming at understanding the causes of
the allis shad demographic collapse observed for fteen
years. The rst objective will be to develop a genotyp-
ing method of SNP markers optimized for identifying
hybrids using already available genomic resources for
the two species. These methods will then be applied to
genotype the main shad populations already sampled
across the French Atlantic coast. Population genetics
analytical methods will be used to quantify contempo-
rary hybridization and to reconstruct the hybridization
dynamic history between the two species. The identi-
cation of the population of origin of the individuals
combining both the genetic data and microchemistry
proles obtained from the otolith on the same individu-
als will improve the understanding of the environmental
and spatial context of hybridization at the metapopula-
tion scale.
Research environment: The successful candidate
will be based at ECOBIOP (https://www6.bordeaux-
aquitaine.inra.fr/st peeeng/UMR-Ecobiop), a Joint Re-
search Unit between INRA (the French National Insti-
tute of Agronomical Research) and the University of Pau
& Pays Adour, that studies migratory sh behaviour,
evolution and population dynamics using complemen-
tary disciplines (physiology, ecology, population genetics
and modelling). The candidate will work in close collabo-
ration with Dr. Olivier Lepais within a multidisciplinary
research project focused on allis shad conservation led
by Fran coise Daverat (IRSTEA Bordeaux) that includes
several INRA and IRSTEA research teams. The work-
ing place will be located at INRA Aquapole in Saint-
P ee-sur-Nivelle (20 km south of Bayonne and Biarritz,
France).
Required qualication and skills: We are looking for
candidates with a PhD degree in ecology, evolutionary bi-
ology or related relevant elds, with strong background
in empirical population genetics. Skills in molecular
biology (general laboratory work, molecular markers de-
velopments) and interest in scientic questions related
to hybridization are essentials. Candidates should be
independent, creative, have good communication skills
in French and/or in English.122 EvolDir November 1, 2017

EvolutionPathogenResistance
*Postdoctoral Position: Evolution of Pathogen Resis-
tance/Freezing Tolerance in Switchgrass*
The Lowry lab in the Department of Plant Biology at
Michigan State University (MSU) is seeking a Postdoc-
toral Research Associate who will conduct research on
the evolution of Pathogen Resistance and/or Freezing
Tolerance in switchgrass. Switchgrass is an important
target species for domestic production of cellulosic bio-
fuels. The principal aim of most switchgrass breeding
programs is to develop high-yielding cultivars. How-
ever, as feedstock plantings expand, so will pathogen
pressure. Unless controlled, fungal pathogens with ex-
plosive disease potential will likely drive yield declines
and economic losses. Pathogen resistance can be devel-
oped through breeding programs that exploit natural
genetic variation in disease resistance. Much of the
functional genetic variation in switchgrass is distributed
clinally with latitude as well as between lowland and up-
land ecotypes. In general, southern lowland cultivars of
switchgrass have many advantages over northern uplandNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 125
cultivars because they are higher yielding, require fewer
nitrogen inputs, and are more resistant to pathogens. In
addition, southern lowland cultivars are generally more
tolerant to heat, drought, and ooding than northern
upland cultivars. However, southern lowland cultivars
are more susceptible to winter kill than northern upland
cultivars.
The proposed research will utilize new and powerful
genetic mapping populations (QTL and GWAS) to iden-
tify genomic regions responsible for divergence in disease
resistance and freezing tolerance between northern up-
land and southern lowland switchgrass ecotypes. These
mapping populations have been planted at an unprece-
dented geographical scale, spanning ten common garden
eld sites, distributed over 17 degrees of latitude, in
the central United States. Therefore, this experiment
is ideal for identication of regionally eective disease
resistance loci (at one sites) as well as globally eec-
tive loci (across multiple sites). In addition, we plan
to survey populations for survival to identify loci in-
volved in overwinter survival. Results from the eld will
be validated through laboratory experiments on fun-
gal pathogen resistance and freezing tolerance. Overall,
these studies will provide an improved understanding of
the process local adaptation and identify loci that can
be utilized in switchgrass breeding programs.
*Required Qualications: *PhD in a eld related to
Genetics, Genomics,
Bioinformatics, Evolution, Plant Biology, and/or Plant
Pathology at the time of hire.
*Desired Qualications: *Expertise in Plant Pathology
and/or Freezing Tolerance. General interest and un-
derstanding of evolution, genetics, and plant biology.
Experience working in the eld and laboratory with
plants. Experience with analyzing genomic data. Ex-
perience conducting Genome Wide Association Studies

of our consortium (Sassera et al 2011). This bacterium
is particularly interesting because to date, it is the only
one known to invade host cell mitochondria. Our aim is
to to understand the evolutionary and molecular basis
underlying its ability to colonize mitochondria and its
functional consequences. For this we will employ com-
parative analyses using biochemical techniques. Cell
biological approaches using established models will be
used to characterize bacterial factors that may play a
role in the invasion of host cells and mitochondria. In
parallel, we will establish an in vitro infection modelNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 129
using insect and mammalian cells.
We seek for an undertaking candidate who has the ability
to work independently, but will enjoy the collaborative
interaction with our international and multidisciplinary
HFSP team (France, Italy, Germany and Australia),
and the stimulating enviroment of the Institut Pasteur
in Paris.
The candidate should master current molecular biology
and biochemical techniques, such as subcellular frac-
tionation of eukaryotic and/or bacterial cells, have solid
knowledge in confocal microscopy and be uent in En-
glish. Previous experience with cellular microbiology
and in particular with obligate intracellular pathogens
(BSL2/3) will be highly appreciated. The position is
funded for up to three years, starting on 1st January
2018.

Open positions: Biochemical, Genetic, Metabolic, and
Isotopic Constraints on an Ancient Thiobiosphere
We are looking for postdoctoral and doctoral colleagues
to work on a collaborative project aimed at investigat-
ing thioester (bio)chemistry at the origins of life and
its biological remnants thereafter. This project results
from a recent NSF/NASA Ideas lab, and will operate
under a collaborative atmosphere that spans a number
of disciplines and institutions.
We will attempt to recover signals of the historical role
of thioester (bio)chemistry through a combination of
metabolic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and isotopic analy-
ses. In particular, we will work backwards to reconstruct
ancient thiobiochemistries from the systems biology of
contemporary metabolisms, with a focus on the ances-
tral state reconstruction of critical enzymes.
We will simultaneously examine pre-biological
chemistries that can couple thioester formation and
degradation to energy conservation. Finally, we will
look for the presence of a thiobiosphere in deep time
by integrating our metabolic, genetic, and biochemical
results into bio-isotopic models for comparison with
new measurements of C- and S-isotope patterns foundin ancient rocks.
Opportunities to participate in this project are available
at the University of Arizona (1 PDF), Boston University
(1 PDF), University of Colorado Boulder (1 PhD), Penn
State (1 PhD), and the Blue Marble Space Institute of
Science (1 PDF).
Successful candidates will have the opportunity to travel
among these institutions as well as the Earth-Life Sci-
ence Institute (ELSI) at Tokyo Tech.
We are interested in hearing from potential candidates
with experience in: phylogenetics, molecular evolution,
computational systems biology, anaerobic microbiology,
biochemistry, and/or isotope geochemistry. We encour-
age collaborative applications if existing synergies can
be demonstrated among interested candidates. For full
consideration please send applications or inquiries to
thiobio-research@googlegroups.com
Include: 1. a cover letter outlining your interest in the
project 2. a CV including the names and addresses of
three references 3. (if applicable) a short note describing
collaborative synergies with other co-applicants

*Post-doc: Applied Demography of Reptiles 'V Penn
State University 'V Department of Ecosystem Science
and Management*
I am recruiting a post-doc to work in my re-
search group (*http://appliedpopecol.org/ <http:/-
/appliedpopecol.org/ >*) on two projects that both
employ long-term mark-recapture data sets to exam-
ine demographic patterns in reptiles. The rst project
is funded by NIH to look at aging in turtles. The fo-
cal population is a 30 year study of painted turtles
in the Midwest ( http://www.pnas.org/content/113/-
23/6502.abstract), with the potential to also use other130 EvolDir November 1, 2017
long-term turtle data sets. The second project is again
a long-term study (40+ years) of garter snake popula-
tions in California (doi/10.1890/10-1438.1) funded by
NSF. The goal of this project is to understand the inter-
relationship between climate, individual physiology (con-
dition, immune-function, and stress), and demographic
responses in multiple populations of two species in the
Eagle Lake area of California.
The post-doc will be tasked with analyzing the long-term
data and contributing to the overall goals of the two
projects. The focus of both is on demography and esti-
mating demographic parameters and the person lling
the position should have experience and interest in this
area. The position would be a good t for a person with
interests in any of the following: quantitative ecology,
applied population ecology, and/or evolutionary ecology.
The post-doc will be given exibility, within the basic
parameters of each of the projects, to contribute to the
collaborative eorts. Areas where signicant contribu-
tions may be made include: 1) the joint modeling of
growth and survival to improve estimates of age-specic
tness; 2) comparative demography of aging, 3) inu-
ence of early-life conditions on demography, 4) linking
physiology measures to tness and population growth
rate; 5) measuring eects of climate change on struc-
tured metapopulations; and 6) using structural equation
models to understand population responses in complex
systems.
To apply, submit a CV, cover letter, and contact infor-
mation for 3 references at: https://psu.jobs/job/74192.
I will begin to review applications in early November
with the goal of having someone start sometime after
the new year (start date may be exible). Any ques-
tions can be directed to David Miller (dxm84@psu.edu).
Other collaborators on the project include Dr. Anne
Bronikowski and Fred Janzen at Iowa State University
and Dr. Amanda Sparkman at Westmont University.
My goal is to build a diverse and vibrant lab group and
strongly encourage all who are qualied and interested
to apply. Penn State is an equal opportunity, arma-
tive action employer, and is committed to providing

MosquitoEvolution
The Department of Plant Protection is an interdisci-
plinary constellation with good opportunities for strong
research collaboration within and outside the departmen-
tal area (www.slu.se/en/departments/plant-protection-
biology/). World-leading research is conducted in chem-
ical ecology/sensory biology, and successful research is
also conducted in resistance biology and integrated plant
protection. The research eorts are directed towards
both fundamental and applied research. At the Depart-
ment, one group focusses on the chemical ecology of
disease vectors. Female mosquitoes are major vectors
of human disease and the most dangerous are those
that preferentially bite humans. Host selection and dis-132 EvolDir November 1, 2017
crimination by mosquitoes are mainly odour mediated.
Understanding the genetic causes and eects of host
choice in sympatric, closely related species is challenging,
controversial and of signicant practical importance for
controlling these rapidly evolving vectors (www.slu.se/-
en/cv/sharon-hill/; www.slu.se/en/cv/rickard-ignell/).
Duties: The research describes the genetic mechanism
linking the basic molecular building blocks of the pe-
ripheral olfactory system with the 'inherent' host pref-
erence displayed by sibling malaria mosquito species
using suitable techniques. The postdoc will be involved
in a project that identies the genetic changes result-
ing in minor structural dierences that change odorant
receptor and receptor neuron response to host odours
among three sibling species of malaria mosquitoes that
display dierent preferences for humans as a host. To
investigate the mechanism underlying such functional
changes in the receptors due to polymorphisms, the re-
ceptors will be functionally assessed in response to host
odours. These ndings will subsequently be investigated
at the receptor neuron and behavioural levels. Qual-
ications: The successful candidate will hold a PhD,
issued no earlier than 3 years ago. Experience with com-
mon molecular biological techniques is a requirement.
In addition, experience with cell-based membrane pro-
tein expression and assay systems is a signicant asset.
S/he should be uent in spoken and written English,
and have excellent communication skills. The candidate
must demonstrate a solid ability to work independently
to advance our research. The candidate should further-
more enjoy working in a group environment and have
interest in mentorship. Place of work: Alnarp, Sweden.

Postdoc position: long-term trends in protein evolution
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna Masel
(http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at the Uni-
versity of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist des-
tination surrounded on all four sides by mountainous
national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city of
nearly a million people with an attractive climate. The
EEB department was ranked in the top 10 by US News
& World Report.
We recently found that genes of dierent ages en-
code proteins with dierent computationally predictable
structural properties, forming an extraordinarily long-
term trend (see https://doi.org/10.1101/176867). This
project will use bioinformatics techniques to discover
whether these long-term trends are really a consequence
of evolution by descent with modication that continues
for long periods of time in a consistent direction.
Techniques used may include phylostratigraphy (assign-
ing ages to gene families), ancestral sequence recon-
struction, and porting macroevolutionary techniques
for studying speciation and extinction to the study of
gene duplication and loss. A high level of statistical
sophistication is required throughout.
Excellent computer programming skills are strongly pre-
ferred, ideally with bioinformatics / genomics and statis-
tics experience. Exceptionally strong candidates who
come from a more experimental background within evo-
lutionary biology, and who now wish to retrain as bioin-
formaticians, will also be considered. A background
in evolutionary biology is also strongly preferred, al-
though again, exceptionally strong computational sci-
entists from highly quantitative backgrounds outside
evolutionary biology will also be considered. Statistical
knowledge, and knowledge about protein structure and
folding, are advantages. Start date is negotiable, and
the position is renewable, with funding secured through
July 2020.

information and to apply.

4 PhD- and postdoc positions are available at the Uni-
versity of Bern, to study the
Evolution of cooperation based on relatedness, negotia-
tion and trading136 EvolDir November 1, 2017
All major transitions in the evolution of life are char-
acterized by the necessity of cooperation and sacrice
of constituent parts transforming into higher complex-
ity. Conceptually, the evolution of cooperation seems
to be well understood. However, critical tests of the
predictions from alternative mechanisms responsible for
the establishment of evolutionarily stable levels of coop-
eration hardly exist. For instance, the seemingly over-
whelming evidence for the importance of kin selection to
the evolution of altruism is almost entirely correlational.
Few studies have manipulated relatedness and measured
behavioural responses and corresponding tness eects,
and several have found that relatedness in fact hampers
cooperative behaviour instead of promoting it, opposite
to predictions from kin selection theory. The relative
signicance of alternative mechanisms in addition to kin
selection, such as negotiation and reciprocal trading, to
explain cooperation in nature is as yet unclear. In this
project we aim to develop and experimentally test pre-
dictions regarding the relative and interactive inuence
of relatedness and negotiation/trading on cooperation
between social partners.
Our previous work has suggested that mutual help and
trading of service and commodities are important and
widespread variants of cooperative interactions among
animals, which can elicit high levels of evolutionary
stable cooperation. A crucial parameter in reciprocal
trading is the potential time delay between subsequent
interactions among social partners, because this aects
the perceived or true probability to receive returns for
provided help. One aim of this project will be to vary
the time axis of social decisions between concurrency
and delays of dierent magnitude to span the entire
range from coaction to long-term reciprocity. Another
important issue is that in nature most social interac-
tions involve some sort of asymmetry between concerned
individuals, regardless whether this is sex, age, domi-
nance status, body condition, individual quality, need,
resource holding potential, reproductive status, residual
reproductive value, etc. Consequently, in virtually any
social interaction the involved individuals have dierent
abilities and expectations about potential pay-os from
the interaction. The current project aims to experimen-
tally scrutinize the signicance of asymmetries for the
negotiation process between social partners about their
respective cooperative eort.
Hitherto, eects of experimental manipulation of cooper-
ation on direct and indirect components of tness have
hardly been scrutinized. We aim at estimating tness ef-
fects of experimentally controlled cooperative behaviour
in natural and semi-natural settings by manipulating at
the same time relatedness and the negotiation rules ap-
plied by all involved parties. Our model organisms willbe wild-type Norway rats and cooperatively breeding
Lake Tanganyika cichlids.
Within the framework of this SNF-funded project, we
oer one post-doc and three PhD-positions. We seek
highly-motivated and well organised candidates who
can work independently as well as drive collaborative
projects. Scientic curiosity is a must and good English
language skills are important. Previous experience with
studying animal behaviour is mandatory. The PhD-
applicants will need an MSc-degree (or equivalent) in
biology. Applications must include a letter of motiva-

recommendation letter separately before the mentioned

UBristol ModellingVectorSenescence
A 2-year BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position is avail-
able to develop evolutionary and epidemiological models
of reproductive senescence in tsetse ies under the guid-
ance of Dr Sinead English in the School of Biological
Sciences, University of Bristol, along with Prof Matt
Keeling and Dr Kat Rock (Zeeman Institute, Univer-
sity of Warwick) and Prof Mike Bonsall (Department
of Zoology, University of Oxford). The post is part
of a larger project investigating epidemiological conse-
quences of reproductive senescence in a disease vector
^A'- the tsetse y - which gives birth to live young and
has extraordinary maternal investment.
The role of the PDRA will be to develop state-dependent
models to predict optimal allocation of resources fromNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 137
mothers to young in tsetse across the lifespan. The
PDRA will integrate predictions from these life history
models into epidemiological models to understand how
maternal investment aects disease transmission. This
work ^A'- incorporating insights from evolutionary the-
ory into epidemiological models - presents an exciting
and novel area in vector-borne disease research.
The PDRA will work closely during model development
with experts on vector biology (Prof Steve Torr, Dr Lee
Haines and Dr Jennifer Lord at Liverpool School of Trop-
ical Medicine; Prof John Hargrove and Prof Glyn Vale,
South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and
Analysis, Stellenbosch), who will be generating empirical
data on maternal investment in laboratory and eld ies,
to ensure both that models are based on real parameters
and that the models produce testable predictions.
The successful candidate will have a PhD in a relevant
biological or quantitative subject, a strong interest in
life history theory, evolutionary ecology and epidemiol-
ogy, and extensive experience of mathematical or com-
putational modelling. They will be highly motivated,
collaborative and an excellent communicator, and have
a demonstrable desire to learn new skills. Training will
be provided in the development of state-dependent mod-
els, using ordinary and partial dierential equations in
epidemiological models, and running individual simu-
lations ^A'- although prior experience in any of these
approaches will be an advantage. In addition, there is
some exibility to adjust the focus and direction of the
work depending on the interests and expertise of the
successful candidate.
Applications are invited from applicants from any cit-
izenship or country of origin. The position is oered
from January 2018. Funding is available for 2 years in
the rst instance but with possibility of extension.

A two-year post-doctoral position is available (start date
exible, can start as early as January, 2017) in the group
of Dr. Van Savage (http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/-

mathematical models with analysis of large datasets to
uncover insights into biological systems. The overall
goal is to better understand, both empirically and
theoretically, how mean temperature and uctuations in
temperature aect mosquito-borne disease such as Zika,
malaria, dengue, and chikungunya. These eects arise
due to changes in lifespan, development time, biting
rate, and other mosquito traits. Part of this project
is to determine if these mosquito traits change with
temperature approximately as predicted by metabolic
scaling theory. Answering this and other questions by
using transparent, predictive models is greatly needed
in light of climate change and emerging epidemics
such as Zika. The project has the potential to involve
theory development, numerical simulations, and data
analysis. Savage will mentor the postdoc in designing
and conducting research projects, writing papers, giving
talks, and applying for jobs. Moreover, there will be
the opportunity to work with and travel to the lab of
Dr. Erin Mordecai (https://www.mordecailab.com) at

Gross Salary: approx. 2600,00 euro
Description research project and main tasks: Articial
light at night (ALAN) is an increasing phenomenon
worldwide generated mostly by urban areas and trans-
port networks. Recent reviews have highlighted the
biological and ecological eects of ALAN on biodiver-
sity, but also the knowledge gaps. Physiological and
behavioral disruption can aect individual, population
and potentially scale up at the ecosystem level. Some
animal groups may be particularly exposed because of
their activity pattern. Amphibians are nocturnal na-
ture and their night vision is very sensitive. Individuals
exposed to ALAN may experience disruption of their
behaviour, especially the performance of prey capture.
The global unfavorable conservation status of this verte-
brate group makes it a primary targets of ALAN studies
for Conservation biology.
The candidate will investigate the eects of increasing
exposure to ALAN on the foraging behavior and the
physiology of the Common toad, a ubiquitous anuran
that can stand some level of urbanization. The work
is lab-based. The hired person will carry out indoor
experiments on the foraging behaviour of adult toads
exposed to increasing levels of ALAN. He/She will also
carry out physiological assays to quantify the stress level
of animals in regards to ALAN exposition.
REQUIRED PROFILE Skills: The candidate must show
publication record in the eld of behavioral ecology
and/or ecophysiology. Skills in the design of experi-
ments and experience in the eld of stress physiology
are required.
Its work will be part of a multidisciplinary project (ecol-
ogy, geography) on ALAN aiming quantifying biological
eects in that species and mapping these eects on a
large wetland ( >1000 km ^A2) area located on the border
of Lyon, the second largest French city.

UOslo AncientDNA
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Ancient DNA and Evo-
lutionary Genomics A two-year position as a postdoc-
toral research fellow in the eld of ancient DNA (aDNA)
and evolutionary genomics is available at the Centre for
Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES), Depart-
ment of Biosciences.
The Postdoctoral fellow will be part of a multi-
disciplinary, international team led by Dr Bastiaan Star,
working on the project Catching the Past: Discovering
the legacy of historic Atlantic cod exploitation using
ancient DNA funded by the Research Council of Nor-
way. The position is aliated with CEES, a former
national centre of excellence (CoE). Expected start date
is April 2018. No one can be appointed for more than
one Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University
of Oslo.
The University of Oslo is Norway's oldest and high-
est rated institution of research and education with 28
000 students and 7000 employees. Its broad range of
academic disciplines and internationally esteemed re-
search communities make UiO an important contributorto society. The Centre for Ecological and Evolution-
ary Synthesis (CEES) is a Centre of Excellence (CoE)
based at the Department of Biosciences, University of
Oslo. CEES combines a broad spectrum of disciplines
(population biology, genomics, statistics, mathemati-
cal modelling) to foster the concept of ecology as a
driving force of evolution via selective processes, with
a corresponding inuence of evolutionary changes on
ecology. CEES has over 160 members (Professors (20),
postdocs/researchers (45), PhDs (25), Master's students
(25) and technical and administrative sta) and many
guest researchers. The members represent 30 nation-
alities and constitute a vibrant and creative research
environment. CEES coordinate several international
networks. The budget = 150 million NOK (about 50
externally funded research projects). CEES is chaired
by Professor Nils Chr. Stenseth.
Project description Humans have used the natural re-
sources of the oceans for thousands of years. The main
aim of this project is to investigate if the intensive, long-
term exploitation of Atlantic cod has aected its pan-
European population demography or has led to evolu-
tionary change. By extracting DNA from ancient sh re-
mains (up to 10,000 years old), we compare the genome-
wide data of specimens that predate extensive human
inuence to extensive modern reference databases com-
prising hundreds of individuals. In addition, we aim
to reconstruct the early origin of long-distance shing
trade by analysing material from dierent types of ar-
chaeological sites (representing centres of export and
import). By identifying the biological source popula-
tion of bones from a large number of import sites, we
will investigate the extent and range of early Viking
Age and medieval sh trade (see for instance http://-
www.pnas.org/content/114/34/9152.full). Knowledge
of the chronology of such long-distance trade yields
fundamental insights into historic exploitation patterns.
In this project, we have access to unique biological mate-
rial from dierent countries that will be analysed using
high-throughput, whole-genome sequencing approaches.
The successful applicant will join a multi-disciplinary,
international team that brings together experts from
the elds of biology, archaeology and zooarchaeology.
The research fellow's main task will be the comparative
genomic analyses of hundreds of individually sequenced
ancient genomes. These data will be interpreted in close
dialog with project partners and archaeological sample
providers. The ideal candidate will make a major con-
tribution to the planned research, but may also develop
her/his own complementary lines of research that reect
the candidate's own expertise and interests, and that t
within the project's main goals. This project forms a col-
laboration between the CEES at the University of Oslo,November 1, 2017 EvolDir 145

Requirements Applicants must hold a PhD-degree (or
other corresponding education equivalent to a Norwe-
gian doctoral degree) with a background within pop-
ulation genomics and/or evolutionary genomics. The
candidate should be able to document strong skills in
the analyses of genome-wide data using phylogenetic or
population genetic approaches. Experience with ancient
DNA, analytical or experimental, is a distinct advantage.
Applicants should have a strong publication record for
their career stage.
We seek a highly motivated, enthusiastic person with
the ambition to gain insight and publish papers in lead-

between host genomes and their selsh genetic elements.
We study how these escalating molecular 'arms races'
shape the fundamental, chromatin-dependent processes
of telomere protection and inter-generational sex chro-
mosome transmission. To experimentally elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of selsh element cheating and
host suppression, we harness CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
gene manipulation to unleash otherwise cryptic conicts
in contemporary genomes. Drosophila is our primarymodel; however, we have recently initiated projects in
the genus, Mus.
The Levine Lab is housed in UPenn's Department of Bi-

Project description: The spread of farming practices
has had a marked inuence on how humans are dis-
tributed around the globe today. Inferences about the
spread of farming in Africa are mostly based on lin-
guistic and archeological studies. Genome-wide studies
started to make a contribution to research on the his-
tory of African farmers but many populations remain
poorly represented, making detailed inferences problem-
atic. The present study proposes to investigate spread
of farming in Sub-Saharan Africa. The successful post-
doc candidate will help to coordinate various projects
in the group (including eld work, laboratory work andcomputational analyses) with the aim to generate and
use genomic data from current day African populations
and ancient remains to investigate the spread of farming
to the various parts of the African continent.
Requirements: Doctoral degree, or an equivalent for-
eign degree, in a relevant eld. To be qualied for an
appointment as a postdoctoral fellow you must hold a
doctorate or a foreign degree equivalent to a doctorate,
and have completed the degree within three years before
the application deadline. In special circumstances, the
PhD can have been completed earlier, including leave
of absence due to sickness, parental leave, etc.
A general eligibility requirement is that the applicant
must possess the personal capabilities necessary to carry
out fully the duties of the appointment. Greater empha-
sis will be placed on the quality of individual scientic
publications than on the number of publications.
Additional qualications: The ideal candidate is highly
motivated with thorough education and strong interest
in evolutionary genetics/genomics, population genet-
ics and human evolution. Previous experience with
large-scale genetic data analysis, bioinformatics, and

UppsalaU PopulationGeneticTheory
Postdoc in Population Genetics
The successful candidate will join an ERC funded project
investigating the importance of selection on the haploid
genotype in male gametes in animals. Any sexually re-
producing eukaryote undergoes an alternation between
diploid and haploid phases. Very few population genetic
studies take both phases into account. Improving our
understanding of the importance of selection at the hap-
loid gametic level in predominantly diploid organisms
such as owering plants and metazoans has potentially
far-reaching consequences for fundamental evolutionary
processes, such as rate of adaptation and mutation-
selection balance, as well as for clinical applications in-
cluding assisted fertilisation techniques. Currently, our
project is producing a variety of NGS datasets to address
these questions, but we lack adequate theoretical and
statistical frameworks in population genetics/genomics
for well-founded in-depth analyses. The aim of this
project is to develop these theoretical and statistical
frameworks through the application of theoretical mod-
elling and simulations, in combination with analyses of
current and future datasets, to generate and test gen-
eral and specic predictions addressing selection at the
haploid gametic level.
The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and
computational power make it both relevant and realistic
to create accurate simulation-based models to evaluate
both, novel theory and abundant empirical data. With
such models, the inuence of dierent genetic architec-
tures and forms of selection can be evaluated, as well as
dierent \non-ideal" scenarios such as individual devia-
tions in recombination rates, transmission biases such
as meiotic drive, and technical complications such as
allele-based bias in sequencing, genome alignment errors,
etc.
You will have a minimum of a PhD in Population Ge-
netics, Evolutionary Genomics, Medical Genetics, or
Bioinformatics, and be able to full all essential ele-ments of the person specication. Research experience
in population genetics/genomics and bioinformatics is
a required pre-requisite, as is prociency in Python or
Perl.
This full time post is available immediately but the
starting date is exible and with a xed term of 12
months (with the possibility of extension).

December 2021 Salary: starting 32,548 and rising to
38,833 per annum Closing date: 23 November 2017
The Fraser lab is looking for a postdoc with experience
in genomic analysis to work on an ERC funded project
investigating convergent evolution in the Trinidadianguppy. The Trinidadian guppy is a textbook example of
convergent evolution at the phenotypic level but we have
little insight into its evolution at the genomic level. The
overall goal of this project is to understand how conver-
gence occurred in this important wild system. This will
be achieved by testing whether replicated selection led
to convergence at the genomic level (e.g. population ge-
nomics and de novo assembly of genomes), and by deter-
mining the genetic basis of convergent adaptations (e.g.
quantitative genetics). An overview of research within
the Fraser lab can be found www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/-

courses.org/courses/course12/)
Dates: 13-17 November 2017
Where: Berlin (Germany)
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for Biolo-
gists; http://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/)
Overview
This course is aimed at people who already have a basic
knowledge of Python and are interested in using the
language to tackle larger problems. In it, we will look
in detail at the parts of the language which are particu-
larly useful in scientic programming, and at the tools
Python oers for making development faster and easier.
The course will use examples and exercises drawn from
various aspects of bioinformatics work. After complet-
ing the workshop, students should be in a position to
(1) take advantage of the advanced language features in
their own programs and (2) use appropriate tools when
developing software programs.
Who should attend
This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers
with a background in biology and a basic knowledge of
Python. The Advanced course is aimed at people who
want to develop bigger or more complicated programs in
Python, or to learn more about the language, or to ex-
plore dierent approaches (object-oriented, functional)
to programming. The material covered is very general
purpose and can be applied to any kind of problem.
Requirements
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein ac-
cession number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence
is). They should also have basic Python experience
(the Introduction to Python for Biologists course will
full these requirements). Students should be familiar
with the use of lists, loops, functions and conditions in

Vasco Elbrecht (University of Guelph, Canada) https:/-
/www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t7/ Overview:
Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic
tools for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing bio-
diversity of natural communities. Their potential appli-
cations include (but are not limited to) accurate water
quality, soil diversity assessment, trophic analyses of
digestive contents, diagnosis of health status of sh-
eries, early detection of non-indigenous species, studies
of global ecological patterns and biomonitoring of an-
thropogenic impacts. This workshop gives an overview
of metabarcoding procedures with an emphasis on prac-
tical problem-solving and hands-on work using analysis
pipelines on real datasets. After completing the work-
shop, students should be in a position to (1) understand
the potential and capabilities of metabarcoding, (2) run
complete analyses of metabarcoding pipelines and obtain
diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable data
from raw next-generation sequence data and (3) design
their own metabarcoding projects, including bioinfor-
matic data analysis and planning of laboratory work. Allcourse materials (including copies of presentations, prac-
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
Intended audience:
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research and at researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing com-
munity of metabarcoders worldwide. This workshop
will review mostly techniques and software useful for
eukaryotic metabarcoding. Other workshops focused on
procedures currently used in microbial metabarcoding
will be available from Physalia-courses.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours
of practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's
discretion.
Assumed background:
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments, with some
ssh connections to remote servers. For Windows users,
a virtual box running Linux under Windows and/or
the installation of an ssh client (e.g. PuTTY) will be
needed. For MacOSX systems, installation of some ad-
ditional Python packages might be needed for running
the OBITools software suite. The syllabus has been
planned for people which have some previous experience
running simple commands from a terminal in Linux or
Mac and using the R environment (preferently RStudio)
for performing basic plots and statistical procedures.
You will need to have a laptop with Python 2.7 installed
for running OBITools, but no experience with Python
is necessary. If in doubt, take a look at the detailed
session content below or send an email to us.
Program:
Monday 26th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1. Introduction to metabarcoding procedures.
The metabarcoding pipeline.
In this session students will be introduced to the key con-
cepts of metabarcoding and the dierent next-generation
sequencing platforms currently available for implement-
ing this technology. Some examples of results that canNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 155
be obtained from metabarcoding projects are explained.
We will outline the dierent steps of a typical metabar-
coding pipeline and introduce some key concepts. We
will also explain the format of the course. In this session,
we will check that the computing infrastructure for the
rest of the course is in place and all the needed software
is installed. Core concepts introduced: high-throughput
sequencing, multiplexing, NGS library, metabarcoding
pipeline, metabarcoding marker, clustering algorithms,
molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU), taxo-
nomic assignment.
Session 2. Molecular laboratory protocols. DNA extrac-
tion. Metabarcoding markers. Primer design. PCR and
library preparation. Good laboratory practice.
In this session we will learn the basics about molecular
laboratory procedures needed for metabarcoding. While
there will be no hands-on

Transposable elements

Dr. Alexander Suh https://scholar.google.com/-

https://genomicrocosm.wordpress.com/ Topic
Evolution of transposable elements and their de-novo
annotation in non-model genomes
Overview
Transposable elements (TEs) are selsh genetic elements
which exist in virtually all eukaryotic genomes. Because
TEs contain regulatory or coding sequence for their own
'survival' and often occur in large numbers within a
genome, they can have strong eects on the transcrip-
tion or methylation of nearby genes and signicantlypromote structural variation or genome size expansion.
Accurate annotation of TEs is thus important for many
studies in genomics and evolutionary biology. However,
TEs are rapidly evolving due to arms races with their
host genomes and thus often remain undetected in newly
sequenced genomes. One may argue that in-depth anno-
tation of TEs is currently one of the biggest bottlenecks
in genomics research of non-model organisms. This is
because computational TE analyses require knowledge
of TE biology as well as some degree of manual cura-
tion to overcome incomplete or erroneous annotations.
The present course aims to adress this bottleneck by
teaching TE biology, computational analyses of TEs
in genome assemblies (RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker)
and raw read data (dnaPipeTE), and manual analyses
of TEs (consensus curation, classication).
Format
At the end of this course, attendants should be able to
conduct computational analyses of TEs, interpret the
results in the light of TE biology, and improve TE anno-
tations through manual curation. To achieve this, the
rst three days of the course will provide lectures and
practicals on all these topics. The last two days of the
course consist entirely of supervised individual practicals
to further rene the attendants' skills in computational
and manual analyses of TEs, either in their own data
or in a course-specic collaborative project. Participa-
tion in the collaborative project will be acknowledged
through co-authorship on a planned TE manuscript.
Audience
The course is aimed at biologists on the PhD student
and postdoc level who are new to TE analyses and/or de-
novo annotation of the repetitive fraction of non-model
genomes.
Requirements
Attendants will need to use the command line and a
sequence alignment program (e.g., BioEdit) on their
laptops. Basic knowledge of these will be helpful but is
not required. Attendants are encouraged to bring their
own genome assembly and/or raw read data but are
welcome to join the collaborative project.

Berlin GenomeAssemblyAnnotation
Feb12-16
Dear all,
we have the last few spots left for our course \Assembly
and Annotation of genomes" https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course20/ https:/-
/www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course20/ to be held in Berlin on February 12-16.
Instructor: Dr. Thomas D. Otto (University of Glasgow,
UK; http://bit.ly/2xevKXw)
Registration deadline: 12th January, 2018. Last atten-
dees will be seated on a rst-come, rst-served basis.
Overview
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the concepts of de novo assembly and anno-
tation. Dierent technologies, from Illumina, PacBio,
Oxford Nanopoor and maybe 10X will be used mixed
with dierent approaches like correction, HiC scaolding
to generate good draft assemblies. Particular attention
will be given to the quality control of the assemblies
and to the understanding how errors occur. Further,
annotation tools using RNA-Seq data will be introduced.
An outlook of potential analysis is given. In the end of
the course the students should be able to understand
what is needed to generate a good annotated genome.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learning
more about genome assembly and annotation. It will
include information useful for both the beginner and
the more advanced user. We will start by introducing
general concepts and then continue to step-by-step de-
scribe all major components of a genome assembly and
annotation workow, from raw data all the way to a
nal assembled and annotated genome. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
command line Linux.
Attendees should have a background in biology. We
will dedicate one session to some basic and advanced
Linux concepts. Attendees should have also some famil-
iarity with genomic data such as that arising from NGS
sequencers.
Session contentNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 157
Monday 12th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \get it
starting"
Session 1: Introduction
In this session I will kick o with an introduction lecture
about genome assembly and annotation - the past, the
present and the future. I will use this introduction to
motivate the ve-day course. Next, I will explain the
use of the virtual machine (VM), and the use of cloud
computing. This is followed by short introduction to
Linux (although I would prefer if student know a bit
of Linux). Through the morning we will kick o our
rst assembly and put it through an annotation tool
(Companion).
Session 2: Visualization
During this afternoon, we are going to visualize the
assembled and annotation genome from this morning
in Artemis. The aim is to use the viewer to inspect the
annotation, correct annotation and write out les. Next,
we are going to perform a comparative exercise, (compar-
ing the genome from the morning with a close reference)
to understand the concept of syntheny, breakpoint or
errors.
Session 3: Mapping
In this module, I will teach the basics of read mapping.
We will map reads with bwa mem onto a reference and
will examine duplications and errors through not proper
mapped read pairs. This is important to exanimate
the correctness of assemblies and will be used later the
week.
Tuesday 13th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \learn it
the old way"
Session 4: De Brujin graph and PAGIT
This module is dedicated to short read assembly. Al-
though it might be superseded due to long reads, under-
standing the concept of short reads and De Brujin graph
is crucial. After a seminar about this subject, we will
assemble the same genome as before, but this time with
Illumina: de novo assembly with velvet, contig ordering,
error correction. Through comparative genomics we are
going to look at errors in the assembly, and how they
could be found with remapping short reads, and also
split long reads. Last, we are going to compare the
assembly to the assembly from Monday. This session
will go into the afternoon of Tuesday.
Session 5: RNA-Seq
In this session, we will analysis the transcriptome of the
sample we assembled so far, motivated through a little
talk. In the exercise, we will map RNA-Seq reads, (short
and long reads) understanding rst the basics of RNA-Seq, but then will use the reads to correct gene models.
We will discuss the concept of alternative splicing.
Finally, we will annotate our assembly with Augustus,
using the mapped RNA-Seq data and some manually
corrected genes.
Wednesday 14th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 - \do it
yourself' ^A
Session 6: Large genome assembly
First we are going to kick o an assembly of a larger
genome, and let it run in the cloud over the day and
the night. It will be important during the day to check
if the assembly is still running.

Instructors:
Dr. Naiara Rodriguez Ezpeleta (Azti tecnalia, Spain)
Dr. Josie Paris (University of Sussex, UK)
Topic:
Reduced representation genome sequencing (RADseq)
data analysis for population genetics, association studies
and phylogenetics
Overview
Reduced representation genome sequencing methods
are revolutionizing evolutionary analyses of non-model
organisms. Several data generation and data analysis
protocols have been developed to generate thousands of
sequence variants in hundreds of individuals at relative
low cost and speed. In this course, we will introduce
the dierent approaches for obtaining reduced represen-
tation genome sequencing data and will specially focus
on the data analysis. We will cover all necessary steps
to obtain genome variants from short read data that are
informative for population genetics, phylogenetic and
association studies.
Format
The course will be delivered over the course of ve days.
Each day will include an introductory lecture with class
discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day
will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretationNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 159
of results will be discussed as a group.
Who should attend
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are generating and/or analyzing reduced repre-
sentation genome sequencing data (RAD-seq, ddRAD,
2bRAD, GBS). Examples demonstrated in this course
will involve primarily non-model organisms and exam-
ples of applications of this data type for dierent pur-
poses will be covered. Attendees should have a back-
ground in biology. We will dedicate one session to some
basic and advanced Linux concepts. Attendees should
have also some familiarity with genomic data such as
that arising from NGS sequencers.

Computable evolutionary phenotype knowledge: a
hands-on workshop
The Phenoscape (http://phenoscape.org) project is host-
ing a hands-on workshop on Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke
University in Durham, North Carolina.
Evolutionary phenotype data that is amenable to com-
putational data science, including computation-driven
discovery, remains relatively new to science. Therefore
use-cases and applications that eectively exploit these
new capabilities are only beginning to emerge. If you
are interested in discovering, linking to, recombining,
or computing with machine-interpretable evolutionary
phenotypes, this is the workshop for you!
The event will bring together a diverse group of peo-
ple to collaboratively design and work hands-on on
targets of their interest that take advantage and pro-
mote reuse of [Phenoscape]'s online evolutionary data
resources and services. The event is designed as a hands-
on unconference-style workshop. Participants will break
into subgroups to collaboratively tackle self-selected
work targets.

Course description This course on Landscape Genetics
provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary train-
ing and provides an overview of the eld of landscape
genetics. The course caters to students in basic and
applied ecology, conservation and population genetics,
landscape ecology, evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion biology. A key objective of landscape genetics is toNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 161
study how landscape modication and habitat fragmen-
tation aect organism dispersal and gene ow across
the landscape. Landscape genetics requires highly in-
terdisciplinary specialized skills making intensive use of
technical population genetic skills and spatial analysis
tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools and remote sensing).
Even when students receive disciplinary training in these
areas, educational programs often lack the necessary
linkage and synthesis among disciplines. This linkage
can only be accomplished after experts from each dis-
cipline work together to develop guiding principles for
this new research area.
Landscape Genetics will be concurrently oered at mul-
tiple universities across the globe, giving students the
opportunity to learn from international experts and
work with peers from outside institutions. For students
who are not members of the participating institutions,
we are oering a web-based online course to reach a
broader audience. Each course meeting will start with
a live web-cast lecture (no special software required) by
an expert on the topic that introduces foundations and
methods and highlights points for discussion in local
seminar groups.
After breaking out into local course group discussion
(including a discussion group for online course students),
a web-based discussion across campuses will wrap up
the weekly topic. Students who are unable to make
it to live- cast of lectures can view taped lectures. In
addition, students can choose to participate in an op-
tional lab section using R and/or interdisciplinary group
term projects with web-based collaboration across in-
stitutions. The nal two options are provided to help
students develop analytical skills in Landscape Genetics.
Students who participate in group projects will have the
option of applying to attend a project synthesis meeting
in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in May 2018.

The staple of data in evolutionary ecology consist of
counts, proportions and durations. This course will
enable participants to represent and analyse their own
data using GLM and mixed models (GLMM) developed
for the analysis of such data. The course is organized
by team VPA (Phenotypic Variability and Adaptation)
from iEES Paris, the Institute of Ecology and Environ-
mental Sciences.It is primarily targeted at PhD students,
but open to everyone.
Participants will follow a number of lectures, and we
are numerously present to assist them with the analysis
of their own data, as in previous incarnations of this
course. This is a convivial course where you can get
something done.
The course will take place from 20-24 November 2017 at
the CEREEP ecological station in Nemours, one hour
from the centre of Paris and has GLM and mixed models
as main subject, with extra teaching on graphics, coding
hygiene and state space models.
The course website is https://-
glm2017vpa.sciencesconf.org/ . We still have a
number of places for participants. The course cost
has been reduced as much as possible, to achieve a
democratic course fee which is 250 euro including food
and accommodation at the course site. The deadline for
registration is November 1. Registration and payments
are to be done online on the course website. More

Introduction to the concepts and methods of networks
in evolutionary studies (sequence similarity networks,
genome networks and multipartite graphs)162 EvolDir November 1, 2017
This free summer school will be held in Rosco, France,
between June 24th 2018 (date of arrival) and June 30th
(date of departure).
|This school is designed in priority for biologists and bio-
informaticians (completing a PhD degree or currently
post-doctoral fellows, as well as researchers), who wish
to learn the bases of network analyses.
|The main notions (regarding various types of networks,
the relevance of their analyses, and some bases in graph
theory) will be introduced by short theoretical classes,
followed by practical case-studies, introducing the basics
in programming required to run such network analyses
as well as to use the existing software/tools. Our goal
is that, by the end of this summer school, all applicants
will be qualied to perform network analyses of their
own datasets.
|More precisely, we will focus on the following concepts
and methods:
|- Introgressive evolution and large-scale diversity stud-
ies.
|- Construction and analysis of sequence similarity net-
works (construction and sorting of connected compo-
nents, denition of gene families, search for composite
genes, implementation of centrality measures)
|- Construction and analysis of genome networks (con-
struction of weighted genome networks, implementation
of their diameter, shortest paths, analyses of labeled
nodes, etc.)
|- Construction and analysis of gene-genome bipartite
graphs (detection of connected components, and their
articulation points, and twins)
|In addition, 9 conferences on networks and evolution
will be delivered by leading European and American
scientists| during this school.
|This summer school is funded by ERC grant (FP7/2007-
2013 Grant Agreement # 615274). Hence, registration
is free, housing and food (breakfast, lunch) are also fully
covered. Applicants will only need to fund their travel
to Rosco and their evening dinners.
|10 places only are available, with a mandatory require-
ment: applicants must show basic computer skills (i.e.
to be familiar with Linux environment and with at least
one programming language, preferably Python).
|Applications are to be submitted asap, and no later
than January 15th 2018, by email to :
eric.bapteste@upmc.fr, and contain a brief letter describ-
ing why this class will be of signicant interest for the

Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lift-
ing { genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation
tools { are designed to work best when used with a
command-line interface. Because the command line can
be an intimidating environment, many biologists learn
the bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools
working. This means that they miss out on the power
of Linux to customise their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.
INSTRUCTORS Dr. Martin Jones (Founder, Python
for Biologists) Dr. Bert Overduin (Training and Out-
reach Bioinformatician, Edinburgh Genomics) WORK-164 EvolDir November 1, 2017
SHOP FORMAT The workshop is delivered over nine
half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organiser's discretion. There will also be plenty
of time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.
WHO SHOULD ATTEND This workshop is aimed at
researchers and technical workers with a background in
biology who want to learn to use the Linux operating
system and the command line environment.
REQUIREMENTS Students should have enough biolog-
ical background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems, and have at least some interest in working
with DNA sequence data. No previous computer skills
are necessary, as we will introduce Linux starting with
the very basics.
Students need to bring a laptop with a Linux virtual
machine installed (we will distribute instructions for
downloading and installing the virtual machine before
the course starts).
SESSION CONTENT 1. The design of Linux In the
rst session we briey cover the design of Linux: how is
it dierent from Windows/OSX and how is it best used?
We'll then jump straight onto the command line and
learn about the layout of the Linux lesystem and how
to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's le permission sys-
tem (which often trips up beginners), how paths work,
and how we actually run programs on the command
line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the command line
more eciently, and how to deal with programs that
are misbehaving. We'll nish this session by looking at
the built in help system and how to read and interpret
manual pages.
2. System management We'll rst look at a few com-
mand line tools for monitoring the status of the system
and keeping track of what's happening to processor
power, memory, and disk space. We'll go over the pro-
cess of installing new software from the built in reposi-
tories (which is easy) and from source code downloads
(which is trickier). We'll also introduce some tools for
benchmarking software (measuring the time/memory
requirements of processing large datasets).
3. Manipulating tabular data Many data types we want
to work with in bioinformatics are stored as tabular
plain text les, and here we learn all about manipu-
lating tabular data on the command line. We'll start
with simple things like extracting columns, ltering and
sorting, searching for text before moving on to more
complex tasks like searching for duplicated values, sum-
marizing large les, and combining simple tools intolong commands.
4. Constructing pipelines In this session we will look at
the various tools Linux has for constructing pipelines
out of individual commands. Aliases, shell redirection,
pipes, and shell scripting will all be introduced here.
We'll also look at a couple of specic tools to help with
running tools on multiple processors, and for monitoring
the progress of long running tasks.
5. EMBOSS EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformatics
command-line tools explicitly designed to work in the
Linux paradigm. We'll get an overview of the dierent
sequence data formats that we might expect to work
with, and put what we learned about shell scripting to
biological use by building a pipeline to compare codon
usage across two collections of DNA sequences.
6. Using a Linux server Often in bioinformatics we'll be
working on a Linux server rather

course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an
expert in Python and author of two text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-

before the course starts) Course overview: Python is a
dynamic, readable language that is a popular platform
for all types of bioinformatics work, from simple one-o
scripts to large, complex software projects. This work-
shop is aimed at complete beginners and assumes no
prior programming experience. It gives an overview of
the language with an emphasis on practical problem-
solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various
aspects of bioinformatics work. After completing the
workshop, students should be in a position to (1) apply
the skills they have learned to tackle problems in their
own research and (2) continue their Python education
in a self-directed way.166 EvolDir November 1, 2017
Intended audience: This workshop is aimed at all re-
searchers and technical workers with a background in
biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus
has been planned with complete beginners in mind; peo-
ple with previous programming experience are welcome
to attend as a refresher but may nd the pace a bit
slow.
Teaching format: The workshop is delivered over ten
half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organizer's discretion. There will also be plenty
of time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum:
Monday 27th Module 1: Introduction.
We will start with a general introduction to Python and
explain why it is useful and how learning to program
can benet your research. Some time will be taken
to explain the format of the course. We will outline
the edit-run-x cycle of software development and talk
about how to avoid common text editing errors. In this
session, we also check that the computing infrastructure
for the rest of the course is in place.^ a eCore concepts in-
troduced: source code; text editors; whitespace; syntax
and syntax error; and Python versions.
Module 2: Output and text manipulation. This session
will show students how to write very simple programs
that produce output to the terminal and in doing so be-
come comfortable with editing and running Python code.
This session also introduces many of the technical terms
that we'll rely on in future sessions. We will run through
some examples of tools for working with text and show
how they work in the context of biological sequence
manipulation. We also cover dierent types of errors
and error messages and learn how to go about xing
them methodically.^ a eCore concepts introduced: termi-
nals; standard output; variables and naming;^ a estrings
and characters; special characters; output formatting;
statements; functions; methods; arguments; comments.
Tuesday 28th
Module 3: File IO and user interfaces. We will discussabout the importance of les in bioinformatics pipelines
and workows during this session, and we then explore
the Python interfaces for reading from and writing to
les. This involves introducing the idea of types and ob-
jects and a bit of discussion about how Python interacts
with the operating system. The practical session is spent
combining the techniques from session 2 with the le
IO tools to create basic le-processing scripts.^ a eCore
concepts introduced: objects and classes; paths and
folders; relationships between variables and values; text
and binary les; newlines.
Module 4: Flow control 1: loops. A discussion of the
limitations of the techniques learned in session 3 quickly
reveals that ow control is required to write more so-
phisticated le-processing programs, at this point we
will progress on to the concept of loops. We look at the
way in which Python loops work, and how they can be
used in a variety of contexts.^ a eWe explore the use of
loops and lists together to tackle some more dicult

December 2017.
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Denitions
of size and shape * Geometric methods to characterise
shape from a conguration of landmark points (Pro-
crustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation, scat-
ter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal com-
ponent analysis * Measurement error and outliers *
Shape transformations and 'warping' { the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing
between groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) *
Allometry and size correction * Inuence of external
factors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response studies)
* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics
of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives,
QTL analyses. * Phylogeny: examining the history of
evolutionary changes of shape168 EvolDir November 1, 2017
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.

editions of the B@G Winter School that received en-
thusiastic feedback from both the instructors and the
students, we are happy to announce that the School will
take place again with a similar program and format.

OBJECTIVES The application of next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) technologies to non-model organisms is
now well-established and has unlocked new frontiers for
research on adaptation genomics. Despite recent tech-
nological developments enabling an increasing number
of projects to use genome-scale data, the analysis of
such complex data sets still raises substantial hurdles
for researchers with primarily a biological background.
Bioinformatic pipelines oer an invaluable resource to
process genomic data, but their underlying rationale of-
ten remains hard to understand, which poses signicant
challenges for their rigorous use and for the accurate
interpretation of the results. The B@G Winter School
provides an opportunity for researchers to penetrate
the 'black box' behind the complex bioinformatics ap-
proaches available for investigating adaptation genomics
throughout the analytical pipeline; from the programs
and assumptions necessary to produce a high-quality
SNP dataset to the in-depth interpretation of methods
designed to address key evolutionary questions. B@G170 EvolDir November 1, 2017
teachers are established scientists with a primary role in
the development of widely used bioinformatic software,
and will provide insights into the foundations of the
algorithms and suggest best practice in experimental
design and analysis.
AUDIENCE The School is primarily aimed at evolution-
ary biologists and bioinformaticians who want to gain
deeper knowledge on state-of-the-art methods used to de-
tect evolutionary patterns from genome-wide nucleotide
data. Applications from early career researchers (moti-
vated Master students, PhD and post-doctoral level), as
well as faculty with a background in ecology, genetics,
or bioinformatics, will be considered. The workshop is
particularly aimed at candidates with experience of the
Unix environment and with preliminary knowledge on
analytical pipelines for genomic data. Participants will
be requested to bring their own laptop with which to
connect to a server for the practical sessions. Classes
will include lectures on the theoretical background of
the programs and practical demonstrations given by the
instructor followed by hands-on exercises performed by
the participants under guided supervision.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch).
COST Total fee for participants is 750.- CHF. This in-
cludes tuition and accommodation in double rooms with
full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
at the Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop. A
limited number of single rooms may be available upon
request at an additional fee of 300.- CHF.
REGISTRATION The workshop will be limited to 30participants. We ask that all interested participants
submit a cover letter (1 page max) detailing their re-
search interests, their level of bioinformatics experience,
and motivation for attending the workshop, as well as
their CV (2 pages max) to BioinfAdapt@env.ethz.ch by
November 19th 2017. Participants will be notied of
the outcome of the selection process by December 4th
2017.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoralNovember 1, 2017 EvolDir 171
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
