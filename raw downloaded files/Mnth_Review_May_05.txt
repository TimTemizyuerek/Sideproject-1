DIVERSITY AT SSE/SSB 2005:
Call for volunteer mentors for this program from grad-
uate students, postdocs and faculty.
The Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biol-
ogy (UMEB) program will take place again at the 2005
meeting this June in Fairbanks, Alaska. Twelve indi-
viduals have generously volunteered to serve as men-
tors, but the program will work best if we can get this
number up to twenty one. Duties will include meeting
with a pair of undergraduates in the program, attending
and demystifying a half-day of talks with them, joining
them for a meal, introducing them to colleagues and in
general befriending them in ways that make evolution-
ary biology seem like a welcoming discipline. No costs
for travel, housing or registration are covered. Please
spread the word about this very rewarding activity.
Please send an email to Rich Kliman (rmkli-
man@cedarcrest.edu) if you would you like to be a men-
tor.

THE MAJOR TRANSITIONS IN EVOLUTION
We would like to call the attention of EVOLDIR mem-
bers to a symposium to be held at the ESEB meeting In
Krakow (15-20 August, 2005) on the Major Transitions
in Evolution.
We invite researchers attending the meeting to submit
abstracts for the symposium. Presentations on topics
relevant to the major transitions will be considered, in-
cluding work on subjects such as group selection, coop-
eration, the suppression of competition, and the evolu-
tion of integrated societies.
The invited speakers for the symposium are
Francis Ratnieks (University of Sheﬃeld)
And
Len Nunney (University of California - Riverside)
Abstracts should be submitted via the ESEB confer-
ence website at http://www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb/reg/-

Symposium summary:The history of life has been characterised by a series
of “Major Transitions”, which have involved changes
in the way that biological information is encoded and
transmitted. These transitions include the origin of life
itself, the appearance of muticellular organsisms, and
the emergence of cooperation in animal societies. This
symposium will focus on the major transitions, with
a special emphasis on how the collective properties of
groups of independent replicators sometimes come to
respond to natural selection. In other words, the sym-
posium will focus on the emergence of new “units of
selection.”

Dear colleagues,
we would like to invite you to submit abstracts for oral
or poster presentations in the symposium “Natural hy-
bridization and speciation” (see below) at this years
ESEB congress in Krakow, Poland. Deadline for ab-
stract submission is April, 30th, 2005. We would like
to refer to http://www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb/ for further
details and registration.
All the best,
Walter Salzburger & Axel Meyer
- - - Natural hybridization and speciation
Natural hybridization has been considered important in
plant evolution, but its importance as a mechanism of
speciation remains controversial particularly in animals
where a hybrid origin of species has been only rarely
observed. The symposium ?Natural Hybridization and
Speciation? invites contributions that (i) describe cases
of hybrid speciation in plants and animals, (ii) discuss
the importance of natural hybridization for speciation,
and (iii) illustrate the genomic consequences of natural
hybridization.

INVITATION TO ESEB SYMPOSIUM (Krakow, 15-
20 August, 2005)
We would like to call your attention to a symposium
to be held at the ESEB meeting on SELECTION IN
THE OCEAN : EVIDENCE AND EVOLUTIONARY
SIGNIFICANCE.
The goal of this symposium is to discuss the role of
selection in marine speciation and adaptive evolution,
and the implications for the future persistence of species
and populations under a scenario of anthropogenically
altered selection regimes. Compared to other organ-
isms, marine species pose a special challenge, because
they often exhibit huge population sizes and live in an
environment with seemingly poorly deﬁned dispersal
barriers. We aim to present studies that utilize recent
advances in genomics, statistics and concepts to study
selection, ﬁtness and ecological performance of marine
organisms
We invite researchers attending the meeting to submit
abstracts for the symposium. The registration fee of all
speakers will be refunded thanks to support from the
EU Network of Excellence “Marine Genomics Europe”.
Invited speakers for the symposium are: - Louis
Bernatchez (Qu´ ebec) - Suzanne Edmands (Santa Cruz)
- Thorsten Reusch (Pl¨ on) - Louis van de Zande (Gronin-
gen)
Abstracts should be submitted via the ESEB conference
website at http://www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb/reg/ before
30 April.
General information on the meeting is at http:/-

the symposium should be directed to the

Krakow 14 ESEB Aug15-20 Ageing
Dear evoldir members,
We would like to bring the symposium “Biology and
ageing: an integrative approach” to your attention.
This will be held on the ESEB 2005 meeting 15-20 Au-
gust in Krakow, Poland ( http://www.eko.uj.edu.pl/-
eseb).
The consequences of ageing will have a major impact
on the western world in the coming decades. Re-
searchers in the ﬁelds of medicine, epidemiology and
evolutionary genetics focus on this problem from their
own paradigm. From this diversity arises a range of dif-
ferent systems that is used to investigate ageing, vary-
ing from single celled organisms such as bacteria and
yeast to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, includ-
ing our own species.
The numerous studies on aging and the attempts to
uncover the mechanisms that control it span the whole
of biology, because ageing and longevity are associ-
ated with a suite of traits, dealing with, among others,
metabolism, diet, behaviour and disease.
Disentangling and integrating the knowledge of all these
diﬀerent (model-) systems and approaches is the main
challenge of this moment. The emphasis of this sympo-
sium will be on the integration of diﬀerent disciplines
and points of view concerning ageing research.
Conﬁrmed invited speakers are:

G´ en´ etique Mol´ eculaire Evolutive et M´ edicale U571 IN-
SERM Thomas Flatt, Brown University, Dept Ecol &
Evolutionary BiologyMay 1, 2005 EvolDir 7
If you:
- are investigating ageing or ageing related traits - think
that an integrative approach is the answer to uncover
the complexity of ageing - are interested in evolution in
its broadest sense
Then:
we welcome you to submit a talk or poster to our sym-
posium
Please go to the congress registration website ( http:/-
/www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb/reg/ ) and choose our sympo-
sium (2nd from the top).
We hope to meet all of you in Krakow.

GeneticDiversiﬁcation
Dear Colleagues,
we would like to draw your attention to the symposium
“Genetic diversiﬁcation by frequency-dependent selec-
tion: theoretical approaches and empirical facts”,
which will be held at the ESEB 2005 congress
in Krakow, Poland (15-20 August); http://-
www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb . This symposium is devoted
to the exploration of the potential of frequency-
dependent selection within populations in generating
and maintaining biological diversity. Well known
evolutionary consequences of frequency-dependent
selection, as caused for instance by intraspeciﬁc com-
petition, sexual selection, or habitat choice, include the
maintenance of genetic variation, sexual dimorphism,
non-equilibrium dynamics, and sympatric and para-
patric speciation. The focus will be on the relation
between predictions from explicit genetic models and
empirical/experimental evidence. Therefore, we strive
for a balance between contributions by theoreticians
and empiricists/experimentalists.
Conﬁrmed invited speakers are:
Dan Bolnick, University of Texas at Austin and Sergey
Gavrilets, University of TennesseeWe encourage especially the submission of empirical pa-
pers. We are looking forward to meet you in Krakow,

colonisation
Dear Colleagues,
We would like to draw your attention to the symposium
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY OF COLONISATION
which will be held at the ESEB 2005 congress
in Krakow, Poland (15-20 August); http://-
www.eko.uj.edu.pl/eseb . DESCRIPTION: Recently
introduced species that colonise large areas oﬀer
special opportunities to address both the speed and
predictability of evolution on a geographic scale.
Adaptive microevolution would be demonstrated if the
invading populations rapidly and independently evolve
geographic clines that uniformly converge on baseline
clines in the ancestral population. Alternatively, other
non-selective causes such as genetic drift and genomic
instabilities promoted by transposition bursts must
be considered in studying the evolutionary eﬀects of
colonisation.

- Functional Evo-devo
In recent years developmental genetics and sophisti-
cated morphometric techniques have been integrated
in the study of evolution leading to the spread of Evo-
Devo research. The ﬁeld is now ready to incorporate
the functional aspects of evolution in order to under-
stand the adaptive forces shaping morphology. In this
symposium we aim to attract researchers who study
the functional aspects of evo devo in various researchsystems which will appeal to a broad audience.

“Deciphering human origins and migrations by means
of their microbial pathogens” - a special symposium in
ESEB 2005 -
Human genetic diversity decreased dramatically dur-
ing the bottlenecks associated with the migrations ?out
of Africa?. An alternative, consist in analysing the
sequence diversity in parasites or bugs that have ac-
companied humans during their ancient and recent mi-
grations. Particularly promising are some viruses that
infect renal tissue (JC virus) or T-lymphocytes (T-
lymphotropic virus) and Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria
that colonize the human stomach because they seem
to possess evolutionary histories that parallel those of
humans.10 EvolDir May 1, 2005

AsexualReproductionSymposium
Dear colleagues,
>From the 15th to the 20th of August the biannual
meeting of the European Society of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy (ESEB) takes place in Krakow, Poland.
Also this year, the meeting contains a symposium
on asexual reproduction. In this symposium Franois
Balloux (University of Cambridge) and Graham Bell
(McGill University) have been invited as keynote speak-
ers. Please, feel free to apply for one of the remaining
four 20-minute- slots for oral presentations. We willalso organize a separate poster and discussion session,
to give the opportunity of a larger discussion forum.
We will be happy to meet you in Krakow. Dirk Tim
Christoph
Symposium description:
(The Evolution of Asexual Reproduction) The success
of sex remains one of the great mysteries of evolutionary
biology. While most plant and animal species reproduce
through sex, this form of reproduction has been shown
to be more costly and ineﬃcient relative to asexual-
ity. Many theoretical explanations exist to explain the
stability of either reproductive mode in diﬀerent evo-
lutionary contexts, but their application to empirical
studies of asexual taxa remains relatively sparse. Re-
cent technological advances are facilitating the analysis
of variation on the level of the genome and population,
and hence comparisons of the factors which inﬂuence
the fate of diﬀerent asexual organisms are becoming in-
creasingly common.

www.eko.uj.edu.pl/ESEB/ (Aug 15-20, Krakow,
Poland) are due by April 30, 2005. We invite your par-
ticipation in a symposium on “Evolutionary dynamics
of phenotypic traits in wild populations”.
Theme:
Evolutionary biology has recently seen a resurgent in-
terest in the architecture of complex traits under selec-
tion and the distribution of quantitative genetic vari-
ation in the wild, with studies of a wide range of
taxa generating many exciting new results. In this
symposium we will bring together researchers who are
quantifying selection pressures, heritable variation and
the evolutionary dynamics of life history, morphologi-
cal or behavioural traits in natural environments. The
symposium will illustrate how evolutionary genetic ap-
proaches can generate testable and useful predictions
for the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypes subject to
selection under changing environmental conditions.

Theme: The symposium will focus on the problem of
estimating demographic and other ecological parame-
ters from genetic data. Recent likelihood-based meth-
ods have been restricted to relatively simple models.
New progress based on computationally intensive sim-
ulations should allow one to estimate parameters in and
select among diﬀerent models of almost arbitrary com-
plexity. This symposium will focus on the latest de-
velopments with a mixture of theoretical and applied
talks

SSD%20Workshop2%20webmod.htm
We are organizing an international Workshop on sexual
size dimorphism (SSD) at the Centro Stefano Franscini
Conference (CSF) Center on Monte Verit` a, near Lo-
carno in southern Switzerland.
The objectives of the Workshop are to - bring to-
gether researchers working on various aspects of SSD; -
overview the pattern of SSD in major animal and plant
taxa; - investigate the function and mechanisms of SSD.
Our main goal is to adopt a truly interdisciplinary ap-
proach, and encourage all participants to go beyond
his/her speciﬁc research ﬁeld.
We have invited a group of internationally renowned
researchers to the Workshop. In addition, we have
space for approximately 35 researchers including post-
graduate students and post-docs.
The scientiﬁc program will consist of about 10 half-hour
plenary lectures given by invited speakers. There will
further be contributed short oral and poster presenta-
tions, and discussion in groups. We welcome post-docs,
MSc and Diploma students, and PhD students. Partici-
pants are expected to attend the entire 5-day workshop,
and their number is limited to 60.
The cost of the Workshop will be approximately 950
Swiss Francs (about 650 Euro or 800 US$) that in-
cludes registration fee, accommodation and all meals.
For postgraduate participants the Association for the
Study of Animal Behaviour (ASAB) has generously
provided support to defer travel cost, and the CSF has
generously provided support to defer the cost of room
and full board on a competitive basie. Furthermore,
we shall apply for Swiss National Fund funding to de-
fer the travel cost for delegates from Eastern European
countries. To qualify for this support, please contact
Wolf Blanckenhorn.
Abstract submission and registration deadline: 31 April
2005
Please note that if space is limited applicants oﬀering
a presentation will be preferred. One participant is ex-
pected to present only one oral paper or poster. In-
structions for payment and detailed travel information
will soon be available on the web site.

PhD Studentship in Animal Ecology, Dept of Ecol-
ogy, Lund University, Sweden. Title: evolutionary sex-
ual conﬂicts and morphological diﬀerentiation in diving
beetles.
Supervisors: Dr Roger H¨ ardling (Dept. Animal Ecol-
ogy, principal supervisor),Dr Erik Svensson (Dept. An-
imal Ecology, second supervisor)
Description: Evolutionary conﬂicts between the sexes
occur because strong competition among males selects
for male traits that increase the probability that their
bearer mates successfully. In sexual conﬂicts, such male
traits are favoured by selection in spite of a harmful ef-
fect on female ﬁtness. However, because male traits
harm females, selection favours females that counter-
adapt to the male traits.
Members of the family Dytiscidae, generally known as
diving beetles, show a range of very conspicuous sex-
ual characters that have been interpreted as evidence
of sexual conﬂict. Males have the three basalmost seg-
ments of the fore-, and often middlelegs, enlarged to
a round plate scattered with numerous suction discs,
varying in size and numbers. These are used to grab
the female at mating attempts. There is no precopula-
tory courtship involved but males attack females from
above placing his suctiondisc-equipped forefeet on the
females back. Females often have a modiﬁed back com-
pared to males. The female back may be covered by fur-
rows, hairs or granulations where the male back is com-
pletely smooth. Interestingly however, many species
and populations are dimorphic, so that a completely
smooth, male-like female morph coexists with the modi-
ﬁed morph. It has been proposed that the female mod-
iﬁcations have evolved to decrease costs of e.g. male
harassment, but there is no empirical evidence of such
costs. Also, this hypothesis cannot easily explain the
existence of female polymorphism.
The aim of the project is to investigate ﬁtness eﬀects of
sexual conﬂict in the diving beetle Dytiscus marginalis,
that may explain the evolution of morphological diﬀer-
entiation within and between the sexes. The applicant
should have a background in evolutionary ecology. Ex-
perience of working with insects as experimental ani-
mals is of advantage, but not necessary to qualify.

ULondon FlowerColour
Developing an open-access database to study the evo-
lution of ﬂower colour - A CASE PHD studentship at
Queen Mary, U London, and Kew Gardens
We are seeking to employ a bioinformatics PhD student
or a biology PhD student with expertise in program-
ming to embark on two tasks: 1. to construct an on-
line, open access database for ﬂoral reﬂectance, and 2.
to use this database to explore the following questions:
is there ecological divergence between ﬂower colours of
plants that ﬂower sympatrically (i.e. in the same habi-20 EvolDir May 1, 2005
tat)? Do ﬂower signals addressed to pollinators with
diﬀerent colour vision systems (e.g. bees and ﬂies) dif-
fer in their colouration? Does UV reﬂectance diﬀer
depending on the incidence of UV radiation at diﬀer-
ent Alpine altitudes and tropical latitudes? Do ﬂower
colours (as perceived by pollinators) diﬀer in diﬀerent
habitats, depending on illumination conditions and pre-
dominant background materials? Does the relatively
recent increase of UV radiation in Australia have an
impact on the ﬂower colouration there, as mediated by
the selection imposed through bee pollinators? These
are some starting points, but the project would have
many degrees of freedom for a student to explore, and
build the kind of scientiﬁc independence that is neces-
sary at the outset of a scientiﬁc career. The project
will undoubtedly result in several high impact publi-
cations. The other major task would be to merge the
databases from Kew and Queen Mary, to turn them
into an openly accessible web based tool. The student
will be trained in concepts of modern ecology and evo-
lutionary biology, with the special perspective of the
sensory ecology of pollinating insects. It is hoped the
student will bring along expertise in database program-
ming, but the bioinformatics oﬃcer at Kew Gardens is
ready to help if that should be necessary.

I am seeking graduate students interested in evolution-
ary and population genomics to join my lab in Septem-
ber 2005. Research in the lab is focused on the studyof plant genome evolution and molecular population ge-
netics. We are particularly interested in understanding
the forces driving genome evolution, and in testing the
role of natural selection at the genome level. Potential
research projects include 1) investigating the eﬀects of
polyploidy on the evolution of transposable elements,
2) testing for the eﬀects of gene expression level on
molecular evolution, and 3) distinguishing the eﬀects
of demographic history and positive Darwinian selec-
tion on patterns of genetic diversity. Research projects
range from primarily lab-based collection and analysis
of DNA sequence diversity data, to theoretical model-
ing and computer-based analysis of genome sequences.

IndianaU DaphniaGenomics
Project Scientist position for Daphnia Genomics
The Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (Indiana
University, Bloomington) carries out research in ge-
nomics, bioinformatics and is a principle laboratory
of the Daphnia Genomics Project. This project cre-
ates genomic resources for a developing model organ-
ism in ecological and evolutionary genomics research.
These resources include cDNA libraries and gene col-
lections, genetic markers and maps, cDNA microarrays
and databases. The CGB is also engaged in microar-
ray experiments aiming to identify the function of genes
with environment-speciﬁc expression patterns.
The CGB has an opening for a Project Scientist. The
successful candidate will assist other scientists in pro-
ducing and testing genomic technologies. S/he will par-
ticipate in research projects associated with these ef-
forts. For instance, the Project Scientist will gain ex-
perience in all techniques involved in the production
and use of microarrays, including the use of special-
ized equipment (e.g., Biomek Liquid Handling Robot,
microarray printers and scanners, thermal cyclers) and
various molecular biology techniques (e.g., RNA isola-
tion, labeling and hybridization). The Project Scientist
will also contribute to discovering quantitative-trait loci
for ecologically important traits by DNA ﬁngerprinting.
The Project Scientist will join the Daphnia Genomics
group. This group interacts directly with four other
research groups within the CGB and with collabora-
tors from the Daphnia research community. We seek
an individual with a B.Sc. or a Master’s degree in Bi-
ology or Biochemistry and some laboratory experience
in molecular biology or genomics. However, we will
consider candidates with minimal previous experience
and/or degrees in other scientiﬁc ﬁelds.
This position provides an excellent opportunity for
a bench (“wet lab”) scientist who wants to develop
his/her skills within the context of a fascinating sci-
entiﬁc ﬁeld that is merging ecology and evolution with
functional genomics. We expect to oﬀer a competitive
salary commensurate with experience.
Applications will be accepted until the position is ﬁlled.
Those received by May 31, 2005 will be assured full
consideration. Interested candidates may contact John
Colbourne for further information (by sending email tojobs@cgb.indiana.edu). Please submit a CV and a de-
scription of your background and interests, and have

A postdoc position is available for up to three years
in Rod Page’s lab to develop a taxonomically intel-
ligent phylogenetic database.The project aims to ex-
plore methods of making phylogenetic databases such
as TreeBASE “taxonomically intelligent” by linking
them to information on taxonomic names, synonyms,
and classiﬁcations. The immediate goal of this pro-
posal is not the creation of a new database, but rather
to tackle the key intellectual obstacles that stand in the
way of creating a usable phylogenetic database.
Details of the project are online at http://-

Aggregation answers
Dear colleagues,May 1, 2005 EvolDir 33
Here, with a bit of delay, a big thank for all the replies
re. statistical methods to test for and quantify spatial
aggregation. I paste below a summary of the replies we
received.
Best regards and thanks very much again for your kind
assistance.
Pauline Manhes.
How to measure aggregation
- The most popular seems to be the Ripleys K func-
tion. Information about it can be found on http://
zappa.nku.edu/ ~longa/geomed/stats/ripley/ripley.html.It
is available in R software in the spatstat package called
Kest.
-Spatial aggregation can also be tested with
the package SADIE, free available ( http:/-
/ www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/pie/sadie/-
SADIE home page 1.htm ) or GenAlex 2.1. developped
by Peakall et al (2003) that use autocorrelogramms.
-One could use a randomisation technique : randomly
assign x,y coordinates to n points (n= the number of
objects in your real data), calculate the mean nearest-
neighbour distance (i.e. for each point ﬁnd the closest
point to it and calculate the distance between those, do
that for all points and take the average). Repeat all
these steps m times (1000 times for example) and com-
pare to the mean nearest- neighbour distance for your
real data.
-The programme PASSAGE can be downloaded at
http://lsweb.la.asu.edu/rosenberg/Passage -A Mantel
test or a two tailed chi-square test can also be used.
Chi-square : uniform distribution = chi-square smaller
than expected by chance, clumped distribution = chi-
square larger than expected by chance.
-A Procedure is available in SAS : proc modeclus.
It is a nonparametric density clustering procedure
that can tell you how many signiﬁcant clusters
are present in multivariate data. Information on
the website : http://www.id.unizh.ch/software/unix/-
statmath/sas/sasdoc/stat/chap42/sect1.htm -If you
are interested in aggregation in genetics data, you can
read the manuscript of Mark Miller where he describes
/lessmuchAllelic Aggregation Index Analyses /greatermuch. A new soft-
ware package should be available soon.

Ant Colony founding
Dear Colleagues,
I would be very happy if one of you or some of you
might have answers for some of the questions below.
I’ve searched the literature and I’ve asked my fellow
evolutionary researchers on social insects, obtaining lots
of valuable information - especially of course from the
publications and personal comm of people who have
worked on the species in question for long. But the34 EvolDir May 1, 2005
questions below seems to remain unanswered. Even if
none of you would happen to have answers, perhaps you
know some more naturalist / entomologist colleagues or
email lists that might have answers. I’ll be extremely
glad for all information. If replies to any of the ques-
tions below are to be found in the recent literature, it
is of course my error to have overlooked this and not
the error of the specialists I asked after searching the
literature.
For the species below, the following questions:
For: Myrmica in general, and speciﬁcally: Myrmica
tahoensis, M. ruginodis, M. scabrinodis, M. rubra, M.
sulcinodis, M. punctiventris AND Pheidole pallidula
Do sexuals mate on the wing (at least starting copula-
tion on the wing) or on the ground? AND Can queens
found nests independently (i.e. alone) and if so, claus-
trally? (based on my search results, it seems that for
M. punctiventris and M. sulcinodis the reply to the lat-
ter questions is YES+NO (ie. can found independently
and dependently), whereas for M. scabrinodis the reply
is NO).
For: Formica fusca and Polyrhachis australis: Do sex-
uals mate on the wing (at least starting copulation on
the wing) or on the ground?
Thank you very much in advance, Best regards,

Arlequin PopDiﬀTest
I frequently use the Raymond-Rousset Exact Test of
Population Diﬀerentiation as implemented in Arlequin
2.000, which I run on various Macintosh machines.
However, in my hands Arlequin does not run well in
the “Classic” environment in the OSX operating sys-
tems on these computers. Generally, it runs once and
then freezes. It performs a bit better if the computeris booted into the Classic environment, but it is more
than a little inconvenient to reboot the machine when
I want to run just this one program. Is there another
program that will run the Raymond-Rousset test? Has
Arlequin been updated/ported to OS X? Is this being
planned?
Thanks for any responses that come along. I’ll consol-
idate and post them in the usual manner.

Crematogaster ants
Dear all,
I am looking for samples of ants of the genus Cremato-
gaster from Asia and Africa as outgroups for a biogeo-
graphic study.
Does anybody possess ants of the same species from a
wide geographic range? (Best would be from Thailand
or the Maly Peninsula as well as Borneo or other parts
of Indonesia). To make things a bit more complicated
they should be in good condition so that I would be
able to still extract DNA from them that is not too
degraded.
I would appreciate your help very much!
Best wishes Heike

DNA from leaf
Dear all,36 EvolDir May 1, 2005
I have samples of iris leaves stored at -80 C. I am plan-
ning to isolate DNA with Qiagen DNeasy Plant Kit (96
x 6 = 576 samples). I am going to do it in a lab that
does it from dry leaves (in silica) and don’t have much
experience with frozen leaves. Could you advise me on
the procedure so that I would avoid potential thawing
of leaves or braking the tubes or whatever might go
wrong? Liquid nitrogen will be available during the
isolation.
I have cca 10-15 cm-long pieces of leaves, so adjusting
the procedure is not a problem, I can “sacriﬁce” most of
the leaf and still have enough for the “real” extraction.
I would really appreciate any advice you could give me!
Thank you very much in advance!!!

Entomology book
Hi,
I would like to use Borror, Triplehorn, Johnson: An In-
troduction to the study of Insects as a text book for our
college and highschool entomology lab exercises. The
book has just been re-issued as a new 7th Edition at
a forbiddingly high price of $110. The older editions
work just ﬁne, yet have become unavailable since the
re-issue of the new edition.
My question is: is anyone willing to donate or sell their
older editions (5th or 6th) to me so we can make them
available to our students during lab exercises? Any
copies would stay with the course, that is be used again
and again every year for most likely the next decade.
So if you have any older editions that are accumulating
dust please be so kind and consider this request. We
will pay for shipping and handling.
Sincerely

Nuclear gene markersDear evoldir members,
I am a Ph D student studying high-level ﬁsh phylogeny.
I am looking for nuclear genes that can be used for
this purpose. There are a few genes, such as RAG1
and RAG2 gene, have been wildly used in constructing
phylogeny of ﬁsh and other vertebrates. But I can’t
ﬁnd out how these genes were chosen in the ﬁrst place.
However, I need to develop more nuclear gene markers
for my study. I am going to try genome comparison be-
tween available ﬁsh genomes. I can’t ﬁnd any published
information related to it. If you have any suggestion or
comments on how to develop nuclear gene markers for
high-level phylogeny, please share it with me. I will
appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

available, age and sex information about the individu-
als. 3) If available, known pedigree information about
the relationships among the individuals.

QuantGenet SAScodeMay 1, 2005 EvolDir 39
Dear EvolDir members,
I am hoping someone can help me to perform some key
quantitative genetics analyses using SAS. In particu-
lar, I’m having a rough time trying to calculate the
G-matrix. Speciﬁc details follow, but I would be most
greatful for any sample code for anyone who has some
experience with this.
The experiment is a common garden that combines
8 individual plants from each of 17 half-sib families
from each of 20 populations in Eastern North America.
Each family is split evenly among 4 tables (2 individu-
als/family/population/table). The biggest problem I’m
having is ﬁguring out how to calculate the G-matrices
for these populations. I’ve used PROC MIXED to cal-
culate the among-family variance for a few traits (I have
23 traits in total but haven’t got that far yet). A sam-
ple code for the variance in # days to ﬁrst ﬂower is as
follows:
proc mixed method=REML data=Lythrum; class Fam
Table; model Days 1stFlower= /; random Table Fam
Table*Fam; by Pop; run; quit;
In order to calculate the G Matrices for each popula-
tion, I reorganized the data into a repeated measures
design by collapsing all separate measurements on an
individual into a single column ’Y’ and then adding
a column ’Trait’ which encodes each type of measure-
ment into a number (e.g., Days to 1st Flower = 10).
The PROC MIXED code is as follows:
proc mixed data=Lythrum covtest asycov; by Pop;
class Trait Fam Table Ind; model Y=Trait Table
Fam*Table; random Trait /type=un subject´ um g gcorr;
repeated /type=un sub=Table*Ind*Fam r rcorr; ods
output covparms= varcomp asycov= cov; run; quit;
This works, but gives me variances that don’t match
the variances calculated in the ﬁrst code. I think it
might be due to the fact that I have Trait, Table and
Fam*Table as ﬁxed eﬀects whereas in the previous ex-
ample they were random eﬀects. Or maybe it’s a re-
peated measures problem?
Thanks in advance!

RstCalc problems
I’ve been using RstCalc recently to generate Rst values
and conﬁdence intervals in two data sets involving dif-
ferent ﬁsh species. I’m not having any diﬃculty running
the program, but I’m getting some weird results.
First, the reported Rst values are substantially diﬀer-
ent from Rst values I get from GenePop. Granted, the
latter program’s documentation doesn’t specify exactly
how it makes its calculations (though both programs
are supposed to use the same estimator), but I’m sur-
prised at the magnitude of the diﬀerences.
Second, the mean bootstrap Rst values are always much
higher than the calculated overall Rst value, and the40 EvolDir May 1, 2005
latter usually falls outside the 95% conﬁdence interval
(!).
I’ve checked the input ﬁles and nothing seems to be
wrong. I’ve also tried analyzing them both in their orig-
inal form (with alleles expressed as numbers of repeat
units) and standardized with the standard.exe program
included in the RstCalc package; results were similar in
both cases. I’ve tried minor changes to the input ﬁles,
such as setting all ﬂanking region sizes to zero, but
without aﬀecting the output.
Has anyone else had similar trouble with this program?
I’ve tried to email the author but the messages keep
bouncing.

Scaling phylogenetic trees
Dear EvolDir,
I am looking for a way to change the scale of a phy-
logenetic tree. I have independent data sets and want
to produce a tree for each one. I need to compare the
trees so ideally I want all the trees to be in the same
scale. However I haven’t managed to do this because
PAUP assigns its own scale. Of course this can be done
the old fashioned way (using graphic programs) but I
was wondering if any of you knew of a better way to do
this.
I appreciate any help and comments on this.

Sequencing errors
It seems to have become the common practice to se-
quence ampliﬁed DNAs in both forward and reverse
directions, apparently as a means of identifying errors
in base calls. I have a data set ot mtDNA D loop se-
quences, 357 bp in length, that represent 69 presump-
tive haplotypes among about 300 individuals in 10 pop-
ulations. I am mostly interested in asking about signif-May 1, 2005 EvolDir 41
icant population diﬀerentiation in haplotype frequen-
cies. There are a fair number of haplotypes that are
represented by only one individual in the entire sample.
Unfortunately, these haplotypes were all characterized
by sequencing in one direction only. For a variety of
reasons, I cannot re-sequence the material with the re-
verse primer at the present time.
I am concerned that sequencing errors might have given
rise to some of these “haplotypes.” Is it reasonable to
assume that sequencing errors are random and not sys-
tematic? If so, then might one assume that haplotypes
with a frequency of only one individual per the entire
population are most likely to be sampling errors? Can
these simply be eliminated from the analysis?
I would be grateful for any responses.

SG Runner 2.0: A Graphical User Interface for Seq-Gen
SG Runner is a simple Mac OS X application that pro-
vides a graphical user interface for Seq-Gen, the se-
quence simulation program from Rambaut and Grassly
(2001). SG Runner does not incorporate any code from
Seq-Gen, but instead acts as an intermediary, control-
ling an existing installation of Seq-Gen through a stan-
dard graphical interface. So, instead of typing:
/usr/bin/Seq-Gen -mHKY t2.7 -l1000 -n100 -a.43 -
g4 -f.23 .21 .29 .27 <~/Documents/Simproj/tree.phy
>~/Documents/Simproj/simout.txt
you ﬁll in the model parameters in a graphical form.
This approach provides three potential beneﬁts: 1)
fewer mistakes since the layout for model speciﬁcation
is very similar to PAUP and SG Runner checks that
parameters entered are of the correct type, 2) easier
management of multiple simulations through the built-
in simulation management tools, and 3) broader use of
Seq-Gen by people that may be frustrated by the com-
mand line interface.
SG Runner 2.0 incorporates the ability to simulate AA
sequences using the latest version of Seq-Gen. There
are also major improvements to the management of
multiple simulations, a slightly faster interface, and bet-
ter internal tracking of tree ﬁles.
SG Runner requires Mac OS X 10.2 or above.SG Runner is freeware and is available at: http:/-

Munida gregaria, Galathea nexa Galathea rostrata Mu-
nida pusilla Munida iris iris Munida sanctipauli Munida
petronioni Munida rutllanti Munida curvimana Munida
heblingi Munda angulata

costs of postage. If this would not be possible, could
anyone provide me with any contacts that may be able
to help me? Thanking you in advance for your cooper-

Extra note for evoldir readers: This job is essentially
2/3 population biology and 1/3 evolutionary theory, ap-
plied to phage-bacteria interactions within poultry.Based in the School of Biological Sciences, Bristol Uni-
versity, England. This post involves theoretical analy-
sis and modelling of therapeutic use of viruses (phage)
against bacterial infections, including in-vitro, in-vivo
and evolutionary aspects of the virus-bacteria interac-
tions. Phage therapy is being developed as a thera-
peutic alternative to antibiotics. We shall use math-
ematical models to examine both applied and funda-
mental questions, including issues ranging from opti-
mal treatment protocols to evolution of virulence, mo-
tivated in particular by an interest in how human food-44 EvolDir May 1, 2005
poisoning by campylobacter could be reduced by phage
therapy directed against campylobacter in chickens on-

DukeU SpeciationGenetics
Postdoctoral Research Associate- Speciation Genetics
A postdoctoral position is available at Duke University
in the Noor laboratory ( http://www.biology.duke.edu/-
noorlab/ ) this fall to study the genetics of sexual iso-
lation in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Previously, we
have shown using both choice and no-choice experi-
ments that female D. pseudoobscura derived from pop-
ulations sympatric to their sibling species (D. persim-
ilis) exhibit stronger sexual isolation than do female
D. pseudoobscura derived from allopatric populations.
This diﬀerence between D. pseudoobscura populations
is evidence for speciation via reinforcement. We have
recently mapped the genetic basis of this reinforced
discrimination to two fairly narrow intervals ( ~300kb)
(Ortiz- Barrientos et al 2004 PLoS Biology). The two
intervals contain excellent candidate genes.
The present position would focus on continuing this
work, with the ultimate goal of cloning and conﬁrm-
ing via transgenic techniques some of the genes re-
sponsible for reinforced sexual isolation in D. pseu-
doobscura. Duke University hosts the Model Systems
Genomics Unit ( http://www.biology.duke.edu/model-
system/ ), which can assist with the Drosophila trans-
genic eﬀorts.Funding is currently available for the ﬁrst year of this
eﬀort, and additional funding to continue it is pending.
The position will require an independent and motivated
individual. Experience with molecular techniques is es-
sential, and a track record of high-quality research in
speciation is preferred. Applicants must have success-
fully received their PhD prior to appointment.
Applications will be evaluated as they are received and
until a suitable candidate is selected. The start date is
ﬂexible, but preferably between August 1 and October
1, 2005. To apply, please ﬁrst send a short e-mail in-
quiry to Mohamed Noor (noor@duke.edu) stating your
interest and research/ publication record- please do not
send attachments! A subset of applicants will be invited
to submit their CV’s and provide letters of reference
later.

SION OF BIOLOGY
Postdoctoral Researcher in Behavioural Ecology of Mu-
tualisms
Applications are invited for an ecologist or evolutionary
biologist to work on a NERC-funded project applying
foraging and other models to understand conﬂict reso-
lution in the ﬁg / ﬁg wasp mutualism.
The ﬁg / ﬁg wasp symbiosis is a classic obligate mutu-alism, but the evolutionary interests of the partners are
not fully aligned1. In particular, there is conﬂict over
how many ﬁg ovules are used to raise wasp larvae and
how many to nurture seeds (1,2). The researcher will
use a combination of ﬁeld observations, experiments,
and molecular ecology techniques to parameterise and
test a series of models (2) describing how ﬁgs can pre-
vent their symbiotic wasps from overexploiting their
seeds. The post and lab work will be based at Sil-
wood Park, with ﬁeldwork taking place in Australia.
This is a collaborative project between Dr. James M.
Cook (IC), Dr. Douglas Yu (UEA) and overseas project
partner Prof. Ross Crozier (JCU, Australia).
We are therefore looking for candidates with experience
in one or more of the following key areas:
* Insect behaviour (microvideo experience a plus) * Be-
havioural ecology models (preferably including forag-
ing models) * Microsatellite genotyping (preferably) or
other molecular ecology experience * Field biology of
ﬁgs and ﬁg wasps

RochesterU EvolGeneticsNasonia
Postoctoral Position: Evolutionary Genetics in Nasonia
Description: A 2-3 year postdoctoral position is
available to study evolutionary genetics in the par-
asitoid wasp genus Nasonia. Nasonia is an emerg-
ing model system for genetic research, which has re-
cently been selected for full genome sequencing ( http:/-
/www.genome.gov/13014443 ). Genome sequencing has
been approved by NIH for 6-fold sequencing of N.
vitripennis and 1-fold sequencing of the two sibling
species, N. giraulti and N.longicornis. Nasonia is a com-
plex of three closely related species that are interfertile,
allowing movement of genes between them. The three
species diﬀer in many interesting aspects of morphol-
ogy and behavior. An NIH-funded project investigates
the genetic basis of a 2.5 fold diﬀerence in male wing-
size between two species(N. vitripennis and N. giraulti).
This represents a recent evolution of male- and organ-
speciﬁc regulation of cell size and number, and our ge-
netic analyses indicates that the diﬀerence is due pri-
marily to 3-4 genetic regions of large eﬀect. Fine-scale
mapping and introgression of wing size genes from one
species into the other has been accomplished. The goal
of this project is to use positional cloning methods toidentify candidate genes involved, and to investigate
their patterns of molecular evolution, and gene expres-
sion in wing imaginal discs. Depending upon interest,
the postdoctoral researcher will also have opportuni-
ties to become involved in aspects of the Nasonia EST
project (70,000 ESTs are currently being sequenced in
the two species), Nasonia microarry, and molecular evo-
lutionary studies emerging from the Nasonia genome
project.
Additional information on Nasonia and related projects
can be obtained through my website below
Requirements: PhD. Experience with some combina-
tion of the following: insect genetics, DNA sequencing
and analysis, molecular evolution, QT-PCR, cDNA mi-
croarrays, BAC library hybridization
Salary: $33,500 38,500 per year, depending upon
experience level. Health Insurance is also included.
Rochester has a moderate cost of living with readily
available and aﬀordable housing.
Deadline: The position is available immediately. Ap-
plications will be accepted until the position is ﬁlled.

postdoctoral position working with Dr Matthew Wills,
Professor Richard ﬀrench-Constant and Professor Lau-
rence Hurst. We are seeking a molecular systematist to
investigate the application of total evidence approaches
to the phylogeny of pancrustaceans and their near rel-
atives. The appointee will be primarily responsible for
obtaining sequence data from multiple loci for a wide
sample of crustacean taxa. Excellent lab skills and ex-
perience of molecular phylogenetics are therefore essen-
tial. The project will combine molecular data with
morphological characters, and the Postdoc will head
up those publications that rely most heavily on his/her
work.
The position is available from August 2005, or as soon
as possible thereafter, for 36 months.

A 12 to 18 months postdoc position is available for
a theoretical population geneticist to work with Ole
Seehausen (University of Berne/EAWAG) and Russell
Lande (UC San Diego) to develop numerical models
of speciation by selection on sex reversal and a par-
tially linked phenotypic trait. Sex reversal genes linked
to conspicuous colour eﬀects aﬀecting mate choice are
common in African cichlid ﬁsh (Seehausen et al. 1999).
We have developed a mathematical model to inves-
tigate whether such polymorphisms could be the ba-
sis of rapid sympatric speciation (Lande et al. 2001).
Several empirical studies currently test assumptions of
our model. The postdoc is expected to extend our
modelling framework to develop more broadly applica-
ble models in which speciﬁc assumptions of our earlier
model can be relaxed, e.g. we want to study speciation
dynamics when the trait is quantitative- and popula-
tions are spatially structured. We anticipate this will
require the construction of individual-based simulation
models.
The postdoc will be shared between the Swiss de-
partment of Aquatic Ecology & Evolution (Swiss
Institute for Environmental Science and Technology
(EAWAG)/Institute of Zoology of the University of
Berne) and the Department of Ecology, Behavior and
Evolution of the University of California at San Diego.
The postdoc will spend six months in Switzerland and
six to twelve months in San Diego, with a shorter visit
at the University of Leiden. Salary in Switzerland
will be at University assistant level, depending on age
and experience (upwards from ~CHF 5,500 per month),
salary in San Diego will be about $3,000 per month.
(Note 1.0 CHF = 0.846 USD, Swiss taxes are about
25% of gross salary.)
Starting date is June 2005 (or July latest). Applica-
tions are accepted until the post is ﬁlled.
The successful applicant will have training in popula-
tion genetics theory, with good mathematical ability
and computer programming skills in a language such as
C++. Application material should be sent by email to

funded postdoctoral position (max. two years) will
be available starting summer/fall 2005 to work on the
broad-scale ecology of terrestrial vertebrates, particu-
larly birds and mammals. The research will draw on
a number of unique ecological, environmental, phylo-
genetic and distributional databases, encompassing all
known species of birds and mammals, and all regions of
the world. The goal is to establish a synthetic theoret-
ical and analytical framework for the global-scale ecol-
ogy of vertebrates rooted at the level of the individual
and to develop and test general theories about the dis-
tribution of species and their core ecological attributes
across scales. The data, tools, and methods already de-
veloped for this project now oﬀer a number of diﬀerent
and exciting new opportunities. The research can take
a very basic perspective (e.g. disentangling environ-
mental, evolutionary and stochastic eﬀects) or an ap-
plied one (e.g. investigating patterns of endemism and
threat, eﬀects of land use and climate change). There
are some obvious research opportunities, but the array
of questions is not restricted by grant guidelines and
there is ample potential for the researcher to develop
new directions. RESEARCH GROUP: The position
is based in the lab of Walter Jetz. In this group, the
successful candidate will interact with two PhD stu-
dents (broad-scale conservation of mammals and birds,
regional-scale macroecology of herptiles) and one aﬃli-
ated postdoctoral fellow (cross-scale bioenergetic mod-
els for herptiles). He or she will be able to draw on the
support of a full-time GIS assistant. There is the po-
tential to develop and co-supervise undergraduate and
graduate research projects. LOCATION: University
of California, San Diego. The position is based at the
Section of Ecology, Behavior & Evolution in the Di-
vision of Biological Sciences - a research community
of approximately 100 faculty (including 14 members of
the National Academy), 140 postdoctoral fellows, and
250 graduate students, which is further strengthened
by the neighboring Scripps Institute of Oceanography.REQUIREMENTS: A Ph.D. in ecology, biogeography
or evolution with research experience in the analysis
of spatial data. Evidence of research productivity as
indicated by scholarly publications is required. Sound
skills in the use of GIS, relational databases and sta-
tistical analysis of spatial data are a prerequisite. Evi-
dence of strong communication and teamwork skills is
highly desired. Experience in the analysis of phyloge-

Title: Linking Genomes to Ecology: Evolution of
Daphnia Immune System Genes
Supervisors: Tom Little (tom.little@ed.ac.uk) and
Mark Blaxter (mark.blaxter@ed.ac.uk). This NERC-
funded project is focused on disease resistance and im-
munity genes in Daphnia, the ﬁrst crustacean to have
its genome fully sequenced. Depending on your interest
or skill, the work may emphasize aspects of compara-
tive genomics, molecular evolution, or the ecology and
evolution of disease resistance, but preferably the can-
didate will have an interest in all these things.
Details: 1) Postdoctoral Research Fellow (quote ref:
3004165)
BRIEF BACKGROUND AND GOALS OF THE
PROJECT: Parasitism may dramatically modulate the
genetic structure of populations. Natural populations
vary tremendously in their levels of parasitism and
pathogen virulence, and although host genetic polymor-
phism often mediates these patterns, rarely is it known
which genes are involved. Addressing this issue requires
studying parasitism in a organism that is both a ge-
netic model and a model for studies of natural variation.
This Project will exploit emerging genomic knowledge
of Daphnia pulex. Daphnia, unlike traditional models
for genetic study, are extremely well-characterised in
terms of their ecology and natural patterns of variation,
which includes intriguing variation in levels of recom-
bination. The project will ﬁrst involve searching the
Daphnia genome for immunity genes (based on homol-
ogy with the range of other sequenced arthropods) to
gain a broad perspective on the immune-related genome
of the ﬁrst sequenced crustacean (sensu Christophides
et al. Science 298:159-165 (2002)). Second, the project
will study natural levels of variation at candidate im-
munity genes. In particular, we aim to determine which
immune system genes are the foci of coevolutionary in-
teractions by examining DNA polymorphism between
and within species to test for the footprint of pathogen-
mediated selection in natural populations (e.g. Ford,
M. J. Molecular Ecology 11, 1245-1262 (2002); Little et
al. Journal of Molecular Evolution 59:498-506 (2004)).
Thus, this Project will combine bioinformatics, popu-
lation genetics and evolutionary ecology, possibly in-
cluding ﬁeld work. The candidate will have a strong
interest in some or all of these areas. The Job is based
in Edinburgh, but travel to North American study sites
is likely. The candidate will join a working environment
that is extremely strong in evolutionary ecology, pop-
ulation genetics, genomics and coevolutionary interac-tions (see: http://www.icapb.ed.ac.uk/ )

BACKGROUND Protozoan parasite are the causative
agents of some of the most serious diseases of live-
stock and humans. Recent advances in malariology, not
least new genomic information and new molecular tech-
niques, permit us to test the assumptions and predic-
tions of evolutionary theory that has been speciﬁcally
developed for these parasites. We use experimental and
theoretical approaches to understand how natural selec-
tion has shaped the ways in which organisms maximise
their transmission to new hosts.
In this project we will use several rodent malaria species
as experimental models, to tackle key areas of con-
tention, and biological interest. This includes the pos-
sibility that parasites enhance their transmission by al-
tering their sex ratios at low infection densities and in
response to naturally or vaccine induced immune fac-
tors. Our websites provide more detailed information,

SSD%20Workshop2%20webmod.htm We are or-
ganizing an international Workshop on sexual size
dimorphism (SSD) at the Centro Stefano Franscini
Conference (CSF) Center on Monte Verita, near
Locarno in southern Switzerland.
The objectives of the Workshop are to - bring to-
gether researchers working on various aspects of SSD; -
overview the pattern of SSD in major animal and plant
taxa; - investigate the function and mechanisms of SSD.
Our main goal is to adopt a truly interdisciplinary ap-
proach, and encourage all participants to go beyond
his/her speciﬁc research ﬁeld.
We have invited a group of internationally renowned
researchers to the Workshop. In addition, we have
space for approximately 35 researchers including post-
graduate students and post-docs.
The scientiﬁc program will consist of about 10 half-hour
plenary lectures given by invited speakers. There will
further be contributed short oral and poster presenta-
tions, and discussion in groups. We welcome post-docs,
MSc & Diploma students, and PhD students. Partici-
pants are expected to attend the entire 5-day workshop,
and their number is limited to 60.
The cost of the Workshop will be approximately 950
Swiss Francs (about 650 Euro or 800 US$) that includes
registration fee, accommodation and all meals. For
postgraduate participants the Association for the Study
of Animal Behaviour (ASAB) has generously provided
support to defer travel cost, and the CSF has gener-
ously provided support to defer the cost of room and
full board for 10 people on a competitive basis. Fur-
thermore, we can apply for Swiss National Fund fund-
ing to defer the travel cost for delegates from Eastern
European countries. To qualify for this support, please
contact Wolf Blanckenhorn.
Abstract submission and registration deadline: 30 April
2005.
Please note that if space is limited applicants oﬀering
a presentation will be preferred. One participant is ex-
pected to present only one oral paper or poster.
TRAVEL & VENUE Conference Location - The Centro
Stefano Franscini ( http://www.csf.ethz.ch/ ) at Monte
Verit` a, CH-6612 Ascona, near Locarno, Switzerland
(phone: +41 91 791 01 81), is a conference centre be-
longing to ETH, the Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology, and to the Canton Ticino, one of the Italian-
speaking states of the Swiss Confederation. The Monte
Verit` a has a rich history as a harbour for artists, intel-
lectuals and utopists in XXth century.Surroundings and climate - ASCONA is in a beautiful
area of Switzerland, situated just South of the Alps at
Lago Maggiore, close to the Italian border. See http:/-
/www.csf.ethz.ch/about/location for its location, but
you can also consult the Michelin Map Site http://-
www.viamichelin.com/ and type in LOCARNO or AS-
CONA for a closer view. The climate should be warm
to hot in August (see http://www.meteoswiss.ch/en/
for the forecast). Consider http://www.ticino-info.ch/-
control for general tourist information on this area of
Switzerland.
Travel - Travel to the conference site will take a
while, but you will be rewarded by beautiful scenery.
How to reach the Conference Centre is explained on
the CSF website see http://www.csf.ethz.ch/about/-
location . The city to use as ﬁnal destination is actually
LOCARNO. ASCONA is a smaller village very close to
LOCARNO, and Monte Verita is on a hill above AS-
CONA. There are essentially three routes.
(1) Fly to ZURICH airport ( http://www.zurich-
airport.com/ZRH/default.asp?ID site=1&sp=-
en&hp=1 ), and then take a train to LOCARNO.
There are frequent and some direct connections from
Z¨ urich Airport to Locarno, and the train journey oﬀers
beautiful sightseeing through the Alps, taking about 3
h. Consult the Swiss train website for schedules, prices
and booking http://www.sbb.ch/en/index.htm . Trains
in Switzerland are comfortable, safe and reliably on
time.
(2) Fly to MILANO, Italy, Malpensa airport ( http://-
www.airwise.com/airports/europe/MXP/ ). This is ge-
ographically much closer (south), but from there it will
still take about 2.5 h to get to Locarno. There is a
regular bus in summer from Malpensa to Lugano (see

Laboratory oﬀer a hands-on workshop:
Microsatellites are a powerful class of genetic markers
used in a variety of molecular studies such as determin-
ing ﬁne scale population structure, parentage, and indi-
vidual identiﬁcation. The genomes of most eukaryotes
contain thousands of loci containing short nucleotide se-
quence motifs tandemly repeated many times, such as
(CT/GA)n. The repeat units tend to be highly poly-
morphic, and several loci taken together produce a ge-
netic ﬁngerprint that is consistent and unchanging from
one individual to the next. While readily used and an-alyzed, it is generally necessary to develop a new set
of markers for each species, as there tends to be little
crossover between species unless fairly closely related.
Developing a microsatellite library can be a long and
troublesome task, especially for those with limited
molecular background. This workshop will take par-
ticipants through the steps used to build an enriched
microsatellite library using DNA from their species of
interest using a variety of molecular techniques such re-
striction enzyme digestion, ligation, PCR, and several
screening protocols to ﬁnd loci containing polymorphic
repeat motifs. Participants will also learn about primer
design and statistical analyses.

UMichigan NatHistoryEvol
The University of Michigan Biological Station ( http://-
www.lsa.umich.edu/umbs ) announces a summer course
named Natural History and Evolution. It is intended
for students who wish to both learn about evolution-
ary biology and be exposed to the natural history of a
region. Lectures emphasize evolutionary theory as the
explanation of observed organic diversity in the north-
ern Michigan region. Field experiments will involve
plants and animals, aquatic and terrestrial situations
and utilize observational, experimental and statistical
techniques. Numerous ﬁeld trips will be taken to un-
derstand the importance of human modiﬁcations of the
environment, biological diversity, and diﬀerential sur-
vival of organisms.
The summer session is eight weeks long and typically a
student takes two classes, each meeting for two days a
week. All students live on campus in rustic cabins and
eat together in the dining hall. Northern Michigan is
a beautiful setting for ﬁeld biology, with its extensive
forests, shorelines, rivers, lakes, dunes, and wetlands.
Many scholarships and diﬀerent sources of ﬁnancial aid
are available to qualiﬁed students. Please refer to the
website above for all the details.

InstructionsMay 1, 2005 EvolDir 63
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
