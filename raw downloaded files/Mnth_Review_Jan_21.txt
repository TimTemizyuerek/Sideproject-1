\Fitness maps to a large-eect locus in introduced stick-
leback"
| Abstract: Benecial variants with large tness eects
can contribute to adaptation in new environments un-
der certain conditions. Genes having large eects on
phenotypic dierences between populations are known
from numerous taxa, but tness eect sizes have rarely
been estimated. We mapped tness over a generation
in an F2 intercross between a marine and a lake stick-
leback population introduced to a freshwater pond. A
QTL map of the number of surviving ospring per F2
female detected a single, large-eect locus near Ectodys-
plasin (Eda), a gene having an ancient freshwater allele
causing reduced bony armor and other changes. F2
females homozygous for the freshwater allele had twice
the number of surviving ospring as homozygotes forthe marine allele, producing a large selection coecient,
s=0.50 ^A0.09 SE. Correspondingly, the frequency of
the freshwater allele increased from 0.50 in F2 moth-
ers to 0.58 in surviving ospring. We compare these
results to allele frequency changes at the Eda gene in
an Alaskan lake population colonized by marine stick-
leback in the 1980's. The frequency of the freshwater
Eda allele rose steadily over multiple generations and
reached 95% within 20 years, yielding a similar estimate
of selection, s=0.49 ^A0.05, but a dierent degree of
dominance. These ndings are consistent with other
studies suggesting strong selection on this gene (and/or
linked genes) in fresh water. Selection on ancient ge-
netic variants carried by colonizing ancestors is likely to
increase the prevalence of large-eect tness variants in
adaptive evolution.

Linnean Centre postdoc symposium at Uppsala 2 March
2021
On March 2nd next year, we will be part of the eighth
postdoc symposium of the Linnean Centre for Plant
Biology (LCPU) in Uppsala. The idea behind the event
is to bring together selected postdoc candidates and
Linnean Centre group leaders to plan for the submis-
sion of joint postdoc fellowship applications to inter-
national and national funding bodies such as EMBO,
Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions. The best qualied
applicants will be invited to present their PhD work in
a zoom seminar and have direct interviews with group
leaders and their research teams to discuss potential
projects. Each year 15-25 % of the applications are
funded.
The Plant Ecology and Evolution program is part of
the Department of Ecology and Genetics, at the Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre (EBC), Uppsala University.
Our research covers a broad range of topics in plant
science at all levels of organisation, from the genomic
level to species community and ecosystem functioning
(see details below).

Australia EvolutionFungalDisease
Degraded urbanised landscapes come at a cost to species'
health and as such may present novel opportunities for
new emerging infectious disease outbreaks.This PhD project will use the eastern water dragon as a
study system to explore the tness cost of city life and
link these ndings to the emergence of a novel emerg-
ing infectious fungal disease (Nannizziopsis barbatae)
which is threatening Australian reptiles. It will use a
replicated design across an urban gradient and measure
several phenotypes linked to immunocompetency, diet
and microbiome. These will include telomere length,
glucocorticoids, fatty acids and skin microbiomes compo-
sition. We expect this position to provide the candidate
with training in eldwork, molecular laboratory work
and bioinformatics. We are a research lab that welcomes
and cherish diversity and values team work.

FUBerlin HoneybeeVirus
** 3-year Doctoral position on honey bee - virus evo-
lution. Deadline for applications: 21 December 2020
**
The project aims to gain a greater understanding of
the evolution and consequences of virus virulence in the
honey bee Apis mellifera. Deformed Wing Virus (DWV)
is thought to be a major cause of honeybee loss in the
northern hemisphere. The impact of DWV has been sig-
nicantly exacerbated by the arrival of the ectoparasitic
mite Varroa destructor, which can eectively transmit
virus between bees. In this project, we will carry out
in vivo evolution experiments with the aim of under-8 EvolDir January 1, 2021
standing the genomic basis of virus virulence. We will
work closely with other members of the VIROINF net-
work (www.viroinf.eu) to enable in depth bioinformatic
analysis of virus genomes, and to develop methods to
identify (co)evolving sites and potential epistatic inter-
actions responsible for adaptive evolution. Overall, the
project will seek to understand the evolutionary drivers
of virus spread and damage in the honeybee, a species
of signicant economic and ecological importance.
We are a member of VIROINF. The project will be
carried out in close coordination and collaboration
with other members of the wider VIROINF consortium
(www.viroinf.eu).
Activities: - Research in the area of genomics with a fo-
cus on experimental drivers of virus virulence evolution
- Preparation and analysis of transcriptomic (RNA-seq)
und genomic data - Programming / Statistics / data
analysis - Project planning (experimental design) und
hypothesis formulation - Preparation and carrying out
lab experiments - Work with honey bees - Understand-
ing of project-related literature - Work activities are

InsectRanges
Hello,
I have a position open in my lab, which is described
below. Please note that it's open to anyone from any
country.
The critical role insects play in pollinating crops and
wildowers means understanding their responses to cli-
mate change is vital for predicting food security and
ecosystem resilience. Populations can respond to en-
vironment variation in a number of ways, including
their behaviour such as phenology (the timing of life-
history events like emergence) and morphology (e.g.,
wing shape). Such responses can have important, cascad-
ing consequences for ecosystems, inducing mismatches in
timing such as plant owering and pollinator emergence.
Yet whilst ecologists understand the signicance of these
consequences, work has been constrained to mostly data
from the last 30-40 years. Lacking historic data about
populations before climate change limits our ability to
mechanistically model responses, leaving us without a
longer-term context of recovery especially after 'outlier'
years. Hence, we urgently require baseline data from the
earlier part of the last century if we are to understand
populations' phenological and morphological variation
before and after the recent major climate and land-use
changes.
In this PhD studentship you will address this gap by
studying natural history specimens collected over the
past 150 years. The project will primarily assess but-
tery and bee responses to climate change, but other
insect pollinator taxa may be studied. To do this, you
will be working with a unique and large dataset, includ-
ing tens of thousands of digitised bees and hundreds of
thousands of butteries from across the UK, as well as
data from over 750 natural history collections worldwide
that use the Symbiota data platform. You will use speci-
men label information and morphometric approaches to
understand functional trait responses, whilst helping to
develop bioinformatic tools to gather this information.January 1, 2021 EvolDir 9
Using this data we will build mechanistic models of when
and how insects can adapt to climate change without
necessarily having to shift their ranges, and compare
this to known species distribution changes. Ultimately
the project will develop accurate forecasts of species'
distributions and, critically, ecosystem service delivery,
in order to help climate change mitigation planning.
If you are interested in applying for this position,
please follow the instructions online here (https:/-

EvolutionaryGenomics
PhD studentship on evolutionary genomics in Tubingen
The Department for Algal Development and Evolution
at the Max Plant Institute for Developmental Biology
in T~A^A1
4bingen has an opening for a PhD thesis in the
context of the ERC grant TETHYS.
Over the last few years, the brown algae have emerged
as a highly valuable group to study the evolution of sex
chromosomes and reproductive systems because they ex-
hibit a remarkable diversity of sexual traits and because
there have been multiple transitions between sexual sys-
tems over a relatively short evolutionary time period
(less than 200 my). The maintenance of a high level
of diversity of sexual features in a single, evolutionarily
young group is outstanding among the eukaryotes, and
points to a complex evolutionary history of the underly-
ing regulatory systems. Recent discoveries in our group
regarding the evolution of UV sex chromosomes in the
brown algae have created an unprecedented opportu-
nity to access the basis of the turnover between sexual
systems and their broad impact on the evolution of this
key lineage.
We are looking for a creative, enthusiastic and ambitious
PhD student interested in unravelling the molecular ba-
sis and evolutionary processes underlying the evolution
of sex chromosomes in the brown algae, in particular to
tackle the genetic and genomic basis of transitions be-
tween sex determination systems. The student will use
already available genomes and transcriptomes of several
brown algal species where transitions from sex chro-
mosomes to hermaphroditism occurred independently,
in order to understand the molecular and evolutionary
causes and consequences of these turnovers.
We are an international research group, and during your
stay you will interact with experienced researchers with
a range of backgrounds, from bioinformatics to genetics,
genomics, cell biology, ecology and physiology, who will
provide supervision and ensure a productive training
period. You will gain experience in cutting edge tech-
niques and after an initial training period you will be
able to work independently.
If you are interested, please send your CV and a brief
outline of your goals and interests to Susana Coelho
(susana.coelho@tuebingen.mpg.de).You can check our website (https://-

ClimateChangeAdaptation
Monash U Australia/Graduate Position/Immediate
start
Predicting species responses to climate change represents
one of the greatest challenges for biologists. Current
predictions focus on sensitivity to thermal stress, but
they ignore species interactions. Species interactions
especially competition shape all aspects of a species'
ecology, including the capacity of species to respond
to climate change. Failure to consider the role of com-
petitive interactions in shaping species responses limits
our ability to predict species vulnerability to climate
change.
Species can respond to climate change by adapting to
future climates via evolutionary change, shifting dis-
tributions to track optimal climates or going extinct.
These responses will alter community dynamics and com-
position, leading to changes in the direction, frequency,
and intensity of competition. Thus, the combined eects
of rising temperatures, altered community composition,
and altered competitive interactions will directly impact
biodiversity and extinction risk across all levels of bi-
ological organisation. Indeed, climate change-induced
shifts in species interactions are already driving species
extinctions.
Current assessments of risk primarily focus on whether
species harbour sucient genetic variation in key traits
to enable adaptive responses to occur. Yet, species do
not evolve in isolation, but rather in communities whose
composition and competitive interactions will dene
their risk and adaptive capacity in changing climates.January 1, 2021 EvolDir 13
The need to incorporate competition into predictions of
climate change risk is widely acknowledged. But we lack
the empirical foundations to do so. Using Drosophila
this project will examine the role of inter-specic com-
petition in shaping species thermal performance and
capacity to adapt to climate change and in doing so fur-
ther our understanding of the role of biotic interactions
in species vulnerability to climate change.
We are seeking a student who is highly motivated and
passionate about evolutionary biology. Preferred can-
didates will have experience in evolution, ecology and
thermal physiology, although experience in these areas
is not necessary. The project will involve a combination
of eld work and lab-based experiments. There will be
opportunities for the successful applicant to pursue their
own scientic ideas within the aims of the project. The
successful candidates will be supervised by Dr Vanessa
Kellermann and Prof Carla Sgr ~A2and will be based at
Monash University's School of Biological Sciences.
The successful applicant will be awarded a scholarship
that covers salary (current rate is $27,862 AUD tax-free
per year), and a waiver of student fees, international
students are welcome to apply, however preference will
go to domestic students due to COVID19 and border
restrictions.
Interested applicants should submit a CV, a copy of their
academic transcript and a cover letter outlining their
research interests to Vanessa.kellermann@monash.edu.

ConsequencesOfSomaticMutation
Graduate position: Genomics of Somatic Mutation Ac-
cumulation and Clonal Evolution in /Mimulus/
A graduate position (PhD or MS) is available in the
Cruzan lab at Portland State University as part of a col-
laborative NSF-funded project focused on understand-
ing the consequences of clonal evolution and natural
selection on somatic mutation accumulation in plants.
Mutation accumulation is intrinsically dierent in plants
compared to animals, because the same germ cells that
subtend vegetative growth are responsible for gamete
production. Somatic mutations can occur with each mi-
totic division during stem growth; consequently, plants
have enormous potential to accumulate mutations, but
the eects of these mutations on adaptation is unknown.
This project will use genomic and greenhouse experi-
ments to identify the tness consequences of somatic mu-
tations for plants in the next generation, using /Mimu-
lus/ as a model system. This work will be conducted
in collaboration with PIs, graduate, and undergraduate
students at Portland State University (Cruzan lab) and
the University of Oregon (Streisfeld lab).
Interested individuals should contact Mitch Cruzan

3DGenomeEvolution
PhD position available in the lab of Dr Chema Martin
(Queen Mary University of London) in collaboration
with Oxford Nanopore Technologies to dissect the evo-
lution of 3D genome structure with Pore-C Nanopore
sequencing.
Background: The 3D structure of the genome - the
set of DNA molecules with the guidelines to build an
organism - is fundamental for proper expression of the
genetic information contained in it [1]. However, how
this 3D structure evolves and is inuenced by other fea-
tures of the genome is still unclear. This is because our
understanding of this biological phenomenon is mostly
limited to a handful of model organisms and by the fact
that current methods to reconstruct the 3D structure of
genomes depend on short-read sequencing. In late 2019,
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) released Pore-C,
a method to apply long-read sequencing to reconstruct
3D genome structure that overcomes current limitations
in chromatin conformation approaches [2]. In parallel,
the Mart n-Dur an lab is establishing a set of marine
segmented worms (annelids) as research model systems
for comparative evolutionary genomics [3]. What are
the genomic features controlling 3D genome structure
in annelids? How do these mechanisms generate vari-
ability in 3D genome structure among species? Can we
develop Pore-C as a widespread approach to reconstruct
3D genome structure?
In this project, you will rigorously answer these ques-
tions combining state-of-the-art experimental and com-
putation approaches in a unique academic-industry col-
laborative environment.
- You will have access to large genomic databases, and
in-house live organisms to fuel your investigation. -
You will gain experience of molecular techniques (epige-
nomics, nanopore long-read sequencing), bioinformatics
(pipelines to analyse Pore-C data), and statistics. -
You will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and
hypotheses.
Benets: This is a BBSRC LIDo iCASE PhD fully
funded position, including home (UK) tuition fees and a
tax-free stipend in the region of 17,285. The student will
become part of Queen Mary's Doctoral College, which
provides training and development opportunities and
nancial support for research. The student will alsoJanuary 1, 2021 EvolDir 15
have access to a Researcher Development Programme
designed to help recognise and develop key skills and
attributes needed to eectively manage research, and to
prepare and plan for the next stages of their career. In
addition, the student will enjoy a 6-months placement
at Oxford Nanopore Technologies headquarters in Ox-
ford (UK), where the students will integrate within the
research and development team.
Skills/Qualications: In a multidisciplinary project like
this, candidates are unlikely to have a background in all
disciplines involved. The most important qualication
is motivation, enthusiasm and that the project appeals
to you. However, previous computational experience
would be important. We can envisage strong candidates
coming through a variety of routes including: - practical

The freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margari-
tifera) was once widely distributed across the Northern
Hemisphere but is now considered rare across most of
its range. Some of the largest remaining populations
exist in northwest Scotland, making it a pressing conser-
vation priority for the region. Here, you will integrate
genomics and modelling to predict how the pearl mussel
will respond to climate change. Previous studies have
demonstrated the utility of this combined approach for
identifying highly vulnerable populations of vertebrate,
but this project will be the rst to apply this to an en-
dangered invertebrate model in an applied context. By
identifying highly vulnerable populations across Scot-
land, isolating the drivers of mussel decline and predict-
ing future suitable habitat, the student will contribute
to the conservation of an iconic component of Scottish
biodiversity.
You will benet from a supervisory team with strengths
in evolutionary biology, conservation genetics and
aquatic biology and from a department with diverse
research interests and a strong cohort of PhD students.
You will gain valuable skills in eldwork and data collec-
tion, molecular work, population genomics, ecological
modelling, bioinformatics, science communication and
writing, among other skills. You will be based at the
University of Aberdeen but will have the opportunity to

Project title: Evolutionary consequences of the social
environment
Background In nature, individual animals live and re-produce in complex ecological environments, facing chal-
lenges from extreme weather, food shortages and pre-
dation. These challenges are predicted to drive the
evolution of diverse behavioural and life-history strate-
gies, allowing individuals to maximise their reproductive
success. Crucially, individual animals rarely live in iso-
lation, and are instead embedded within complex social
networks characterised by diverse social interactions in-
cluding cooperation, aggression, mating and parenting.
Thus, while ecological variation may shape the evolution
of individual behavioural strategies, social interactions
between these behaviourally distinct individuals will
in turn feedback to shape the evolutionary responses
of animals to their environment. Uncovering the role
of the social environment in mediating the responses
of animal populations to their ecological environment
remains a key challenge, particularly in the context of
ongoing climate change and human disturbance.
This PhD project will focus on shorebirds (plovers)
that nest on the ground. Our previous research has
demonstrated that plovers vary in their position in so-
cial networks and that patterns of sociality predict the
formation of mating pairs. However, it is not known to
what extent individuals express consistent behavioural
dierences (i.e. animal personalities), how personali-
ties relate to their position in social networks and the
dierent environmental and climactic conditions where
the plovers breed. The PhD student will develop ap-
proaches to investigate the role of the social environment
in mediating the breeding biology of plovers and the
evolutionary and ecological outcomes of animal person-
ality.
Primary supervisor Dr Kosztoanyi's main interest
is to understand how life histories and ecology
inuence social behaviour and parental care (
https://elvonalshorebirds.com/group/core-team/andas-
kosztolanyi/). Co-supervisor Dr McDonald researches
how the social structure of animal societies impacts on
reproduction ( https://sites.google.com/view/grant-c-
mcdonald/home) and co-supervisor Prof Szekely's key
interests include the evolution of mating systems and
the conservation of shorebird populations ( https://-
researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/tamas-szekely).
Objectives (1) Test the link between consistent dier-
ences in individual behaviour, life-history and the eco-
logical environment. (2) Test the role of personality in
organising plover social structure. (3) Test the impact of
social structure on breeding strategies and reproductive
success of individual birds.
Approach The research project will use eld studies of
natural populations of Kentish plover in remote areas
e.g. on the island of Maio, Cabo Verde. The breed-January 1, 2021 EvolDir 19
ing biology of Kentish plover is well characterised and
much of the methods are routinely used in plover eld-
work meaning parental behaviour, life history traits and
breeding success are easily monitored. In addition to de-
tailed population monitoring, the research will develop
methods to quantify behavioural responses of individual
Kentish plovers, as well design and implement experi-
mental manipulations in the eld. Novelty
This project will reveal how animal personality and
sociality shape the demographic and evolutionary out-
comes of natural populations. Moreover, the results will
be of keen interest to conservation biologists. Shore-
bird populations are declining globally as a result of
human disturbance and predation associated with cli-
mate change. This research will provide key information
for how animal personality and sociality mediate species
responses to local ecology, providing important steps
forward in linking the study of social behaviour with
practical conservation management.
Training The student will be primarily aliated
with Debrecen University, Hungary ( https://-
www.edu.unideb.hu/) and the University of Veterinary
Medicine Budapest, Hungary (https://univet.hu/en/).
Debrecen is the 2nd largest city in Hungary, and De-
brecen University is one of the prestigious universities
in Central Europe with a large international student
community. The student would be based within the
Department of Evolutionary Zoology and Human

PlantEvolutionaryGenomics
I am advertising two PhD positions in plant ecology and
evolutionary genomics:
1. Ecological genomics of the British Flora
This project uses the British ora as a model system
to explore the evolutionary and ecological processes
shaping regional plant diversity.
This research will use an integrated approach to link
genetic variation to ecological variables to better under-
stand the assemblage of species in the British ora. The
British ora is an ideal study system as it is manageable
in size with ~1400 native species, has an excellent eco-
logical and genetic resource base (e.g. over 40 million
plant occurrence records), and can act as a tractable
model for the wider impacts of global change. The
project will draw on genome data from the Darwin Tree
of Life Project, a major new initiative to generate com-
plete genome sequences for all ~60,000 British native
organisms. For selected genera of ecological interest, ge-
nomic resequencing data will be generated to investigate
population dynamics and postglacial history, as well as
the impact of recent changes in distribution. Depend-
ing on their interests, the student will have a choice of
study species, and may choose to take the project in
the direction of more ecological work (e.g. comparing
traits between taxa accounting for genetic relatedness)
or genomic research (e.g. comparing genome structure
of divergent taxa).

Growing on the edge: The genomic basis of coastal
adaptation in eyebrights
Local adaptation enables plant populations to survive in
extremely harsh environments. Coastal habitats present
a suite of challenging conditions with plants exposed to
drying oceanic salt spray and osmotically stressful high
salinity soils. Despite adaptation to saline environments
being a ubiquitous feature of coastal plant populations,
little is known about adaptation to these conditions. In
particular, the genetic basis of salt tolerance has rarely
been characterised in natural populations, and whether
adaptation to coastal environments comes at a cost for
colonising new (non-coastal) habitats is not known.
This project will use British native species of eyebrights20 EvolDir January 1, 2021
to study adaptation to coastal environments. There are
21 native eyebright species, with taxa found in a wide
range of environmental conditions. These species are
a useful system for investigating coastal adaptation as
populations are widespread along the coast and inland,
these species are experimentally tractable and can be
grown in common garden conditions and at eld sites,
and there are a range of genomic tools for linking phe-
notype to genotype. We test the hypothesis that as
adaptation to coastal habitats is extremely common we
expect it to involve the xation of pre-existing (standing)
genetic variation found in inland populations.
The core of the project will involve growing coastal and
inland Euphrasia species under experimental conditions
where coastal stressors are simulated, and under benign
conditions. This experiment will look at the phenotypic
and transcriptomic (gene expression) changes associated
with these environments. The research will also involve
population genomic sequencing of pairs of coastal and in-
land plants to look at the extent of immigration between
contrasting environments.

Disentangling the drivers of life-history evolution in the

Wang, Zoological Society of London Prof Marcel Visser,
Netherlands Institute of Ecology Prof Alastair Wilson,University of Exeter, Centre for Ecology and Conserva-
tion
Location: Penryn Campus, University of Exeter, Pen-
ryn, Cornwall
Project background: Despite a large body of theory
describing how genetic variation and selection shape
adaptive evolution, theoretical predictions often appear
to be at odds with what we observe in real-world pop-
ulations. Although the apparent ubiquity of so-called
evolutionary stasis (i.e. selection and heritability but
no evolution) has triggered many attempts to rene our
predictions by incorporating the complexities that are
typical of wild populations, this crucially assumes that
evolution is in essence predictable. However, is natural
selection strong enough to overcome the eects of ran-
dom drift and gene ow, especially in small populations?
Aims and methods: You will quantify the roles of natural
selection, gene ow and drift in shaping the evolutionary
dynamics of clutch size, a key life-history trait. You will
do this by capitalising on i) over 60 years of individual-
based data for an island population of great tits (Parus
major) on the Dutch island of Vlieland, and ii) a unique
eight-year experiment that combined strong articial
selection on clutch size with cross-fostering and clutch
size manipulations. Thereby you will provide an insight
into the evolutionary dynamics of wild populations in
general, and their capacity to respond to natural and
human-induced selective pressures. To this end, you
will use statistical/quantitative genetic approaches to
infer the role of genes and the environment in shaping
variation in clutch size and tness, and the relationship
between them. This project capitalises on a uniquely
rich and powerful dataset that allows for answering a
wide range of questions, and you are encouraged to
develop the project according to your interests.
Training: You will be part of a large and vibrant group
of researchers working on a diverse range of questions
in evolution, ecology and behaviour. You will receive
training in, among others, quantitative and population
genetics, the statistical analysis of large datasets and
computer simulations, as well as nest monitoring and
bird handling. This will be provided by the (co-) super-
visors and their group members in both the UK (Penryn,
Bristol and London) and The Netherlands (Wagenin-
gen). Finally, you will attend postgraduate courses
and present your results at national and international
conferences.
Eligibility: This project is one of a number that are in

Ujyvaskyla EarlyLife
Apply for a PhD position at the University of Jyv askyl a!
We are seeking an outstanding PhD (graduate) student
to lead an exciting project 'Non-genetic mediators of an-
thropogenic stress during early life' at the Department
of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of
Jyv askyl a, Finland.
One of the outstanding questions in biological sciences
is to understand how organism may respond and poten-
tially adapt to human-induced changes. Understanding
the mechanisms underlying responses to environmen-
tal stressors can help us to predict changes to future
challenges (e.g. Taborsky, Ruuskanen et al. 2020).
Developing organisms are particularly sensitive to envi-
ronmental and anthropogenic stressors (e.g. Ruuskanen
et al. 2019), and early-life stress can have long-lasting
eects on phenotype and performance.
Two recently discovered mechanisms that could medi-
ate long-lasting eects early life-stress are changes in
epigenetic markers regulating gene expression (Laine,
Ruuskanen et al. 2020) and gut microbiome (Ruuskanen
et al. 2020 Lavrinienko et al. 2018, 2020), yet their
role in outside captive model species has been poorly
studied. In this project, we study whether early-life
stress by radiation - a key anthropogenic stressor - is
mediated via these mechanisms, using a wild population
of passerine birds at the Chernobyl nuclear accident site
as a model. This project thus combines ecophysiology
and -toxicology and molecular biology. The student will
gain versatile skills in eld work and experimental de-
signs, physiological measurements, molecular methods
and bioinformatics.
We are looking for a candidate with a MSc degree in
ecology, ecotoxicology, physiology, molecular biology or
other relevant eld, and experience in eld work in wild
populations and some laboratory skills. High motivation
to learn molecular and bioinformatic skills is essential,
and excellent English writing and verbal communication
skills are expected.

PinnipedEvolutionaryGenomics
Evolutionary genomics of life-history adaptations and
disease susceptibility in pinnipeds
PhD studentship, University of Leeds UK, open to UK,
EU, and International students
Closing date 5th January 2021
Pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, fur seals and walrus) are
keystone marine predators, and sentinels for marine
ecosystem health. Advances in genomics technologies
are opening up the possibility to identify and dissect the
genetics and molecular evolution underlying the adap-
tions of pinnipeds to the marine environment and the
startling variation in ecology and life history present
within the family. Understanding these mechanisms
not only provides fundamental insights into the pro-
cess of evolution, but is also important for assessing
species vulnerability and responses to potential future
environmental change.This project will build on rapidly growing genomic re-
sources for pinnipeds, including de novo seal genome
assemblies generated by the Goodman/O'Connell labs
and other colleagues in the Pinniped Genome Consor-
tium at the University of Helsinki and University of
Copenhagen. These provide an opportunity to use com-
parative genomics to examine key aspects of pinniped
ecology and evolution including physiological adapta-
tions underpinning dierent life-history strategies and
among species variation in disease susceptibility. We
will use a variety of genomic approaches including de
novo sequencing of seal genomes, and population ge-
netic studies at the genomic level using methods such
as ddRAD. The student can expect to gain experience
in cutting edge DNA sequencing and genomics meth-
ods, together with developing skills in bioinformatics,
comparative genomics, molecular evolution and popula-
tion genetics analysis. There will opportunities to visit
collaborators from the Pinniped Genomes consortium
including Denmark and Finland.

PlantDiseaseEpidemiologyEvolution
Smart control of crop diseases: how can we best combine
fungicides and plant resistance genes?
PhD studentship, University of Reading, UK, open to
UK, EU, and international students. Submission opens
13 January 2021; deadline 8 February 2021.
About the project:
This multidisciplinary PhD project will investigate the
epidemiology and evolutionary adaptation of the ma-
jor fungal pathogen of wheat Zymoseptoria tritici (Zt)
to control measures { fungicides and disease resistance
genes, thereby using evolutionary biology to tackle one of
the most urgent problems in agriculture. The methodol-
ogy combines mathematical modelling, machine learning
and eld experimentation.
Zt causes septoria tritici blotch (STB), the most dam-
aging disease of wheat in Europe and one of the largest
constraints on wheat production globally. The disease
is especially serious in the UK because of conducive
climatic conditions. It is becoming increasingly dicult
to control STB, because Zt is capable of rapidly evolving
resistance to fungicides and adapting to disease-resistant
wheat varieties and environmental conditions. It is rec-
ognized that no single control measure is durable in
the face of the pathogen's notorious adaptive capacity,
hence the two key control methods - fungicides anddisease resistance genes in wheat - need to be combined
in a manner that optimizes not only control ecacy
in the short term, but also their sustainability in the
longer term. This interdisciplinary project will make a
major contribution to this goal using a powerful com-
bination of large-scale eld experimentation with novel
high-throughput phenotyping techniques, bioinformatic
analyses, state-of-the-art machine learning and mathe-
matical modelling approaches.
In the rst phase, a eld experiment will be conducted
during two consecutive years to investigate the STB epi-
demic development in a large number of dierent wheat
genotypes. The amount of disease will be measured us-
ing both the conventional visual assessments and novel
digital phenotyping approaches, and the daily weather
data will be recorded. The data on epidemic develop-
ment will be linked to genomic data already available for
the wheat population under study, and in this way you
are likely to identify new genetic bases of STB resistance
in wheat. In the second phase, powerful machine learn-
ing techniques will be used to combine the three types
of data (disease measurements, weather data and wheat
genomic data) and construct a model predicting the sea-
sonal STB epidemic development. Finally, in the third
phase of the project, the outcomes of the two previous
phases will be incorporated into a mathematical mod-
elling framework (epidemiological/evolutionary model)
that describes how the pathogen population changes
over time in its interaction with the host population of
wheat plants. The model will incorporate the eect of
two control measures: fungicides and STB resistance
genes in wheat. This will allow you to optimize choices
of fungicide treatment programmes and disease-resistant
wheat cultivars that maximize net benet of growers
over a short term of a single growing season. You will
then be able to compare the outcomes with the pre-
dicted net benet over a longer term of a number of
consecutive growing seasons, taking into account disease
levels, weather variables and wheat genomes.
Training opportunities:
The student will acquire inter-disciplinary skills in de-
signing and conducting large-scale eld experiments
with crop pathogens, acquiring large datasets with the
help of novel digital phenotyping approaches, use ma-
chine learning and mathematical modelling to extract
knowledge from data. The student will receive extensive
training by the supervisory team in computer program-
ming to handle large and complex data sets and conduct
mathematical and computational modelling using Linux,
Python and R. The student will have access to advanced
computational infrastructures, such as the high- per-
formance computing clusters available at Aberystwyth
University, and via Supercomputing Wales, and receive28 EvolDir January 1, 2021
appropriate training in their usage. The student will be
embedded within the extensive international collabora-
tive network of the supervisory team that includes plant
pathologists, genomics experts, modellers and practice-
oriented researchers, enabling the student to make use
of these diverse sets of expertise. A three-month place-
ment with Syngenta will provide the student with the
industry's perspective on the project's outcomes, ex-
panding the range of possible employment options after
the completion of the project. The unique combination
of empirical, mathematical and computational skills as
well as a valuable professional network developed in the
course of the project will increase the student's chances
to nd a high-prole job in academia, governmental
agencies or industry.

PhenotypicConvergenceButteries
Graduate position: USBo-
hemia Czechia.PhenotypicConvergenceButteries
New PhD Position: Phenotypic convergence in Neotrop-
ical skipper butteries (Please, feel free to distribute
to all potential candidates) Closing date: December 31,
2020January 1, 2021 EvolDir 29
You will be part of an exciting project studying the role
of species interactions in the diversication of skipper
butteries (family Hesperiidae) in the Neotropics. The
goal of the PhD position is to test competing hypotheses
for understanding the evolution of convergent pheno-
types. It is expected to obtain measurements of shape
and color variation in buttery wings across species, and
to test potential drivers of phenotypic similarity using
geometric morphometrics and an available species-level
phylogeny.
You will also carry out experiments in the eld (rain-
forest in Peru) in collaboration with our partners at
the Natural History Museum in Lima (Depts. of En-
tomology and Ornithology). We will measure defense
strategies in butteries against avian predators (e.g., un-
palatability, escape ability) using bird enclosures. These
data will allow quantifying the strength of predator
selection on the evolution of buttery wings.
The project will provide novel knowledge on phenotypic
convergence among unrelated buttery species at both
the phylogenetic and the community levels. The overall
aim of the PhD work is to bring in deep understand-
ing of buttery wing phenotype evolution driven by
predator-prey interactions.
Priority will be given to candidates who have co-
authored at least one scientic publication (including
submitted and accepted manuscripts). Experience with
conducting eldwork in the tropics, handling birds in
manipulative experiments and/or using geometric mor-
phometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods are
desirable. Due to eldwork in Peru, basic language skills
in Spanish are advantageous.
The results will be part of a larger multidisciplinary
framework aiming at determining the role of biotic and
abiotic factors in the diversication of Neotropical but-
teries at dierent evolutionary and ecological scales.
As part of the research activities of our international
team, multiple avenues for networking will be possible,
including our collaborators Dr. Marianne Elias (Natu-
ral History Museum, France; http://tiny.cc/Elias), Dr.
Andre V. L. Freitas (University of Campinas, Brazil;
http://tiny.cc/Freitas) and Dr. Katerina Sam (Biology
Centre, CAS; https://multitrophicinteractions.blog/).
The applicant must have the following qualications:
- Master???s degree in biology or related elds (must
be awarded prior to the starting date). - Good com-
munication skills in English, written and spoken. - In-
dependence in learning and working, with documented
productivity.
It is expected that you will enroll into the associated
PhD program (4 years) at the Faculty of Sciences, Uni-versity of South Bohemia (https://www.prf.jcu.cz/en).
The scholarship will be a combination of research grant
salary (50%, from the Biology Centre, Czech Academy
of Sciences, https://www.entu.cas.cz/en/) plus student
stipends (50% from the University of South Bohemia),
fully covering living expenses with a comfortable margin
in the Czech Republic. The research facility is in Ceske
Budejovice, a charming historical city in the south of
the country, within an easy reach of Prague and Vienna.
Our working environment (Department of Ecology, led
by Prof. Vojtech Novotny, http://tiny.cc/Novotny) is
highly diverse and international (16 nationalities from 4
dierent continents).
The application is by e-mail (to
pavel.matos@entu.cas.cz) and must be written in
English. The following documents must be attached
in one single PDF le: - Cover letter, stating your
motivation, how your background and skills t the
project, and your potential plans for this position (max.
2 pages). - CV, including contact details of at least two
referees that are familiar with your work.
The deadline for applications is December 31, 2020. The
top ranked candidates will be selected for an interview
in English (by phone/skype). The start date is upon
agreement, but the successful applicant is expected to
start during spring 2021.

can contribute to explaining arthropod diversity pat-
terns across the arthropod phylogeny, and in relation
to elevation, anthropogenic habitat disturbance, and fu-
ture climate change. We envisage that one student will
focus on elevation and climate change, and the other
on anthropogenic habitat change. Students will con-
duct eld sampling for fungus-infected arthropods and
assess arthropod population sizes, experimental eradica-
tions of fungi in the wild, experimental exploration of
climate impacts in the laboratory, molecular identica-
tion of arthropods and fungi in the lab, and statistical
analysis of results, including incorporation of fungus-
arthropod network data into the LifeWebs database (

ExplainingHumanHandedness
Applications are invited for a 3.5 year PhD studentship
in the research groups of Prof Andy Gardner and Dr
Silvia Paracchini at the University of St Andrews, Scot-
land.
The studentship is fully-funded and covers tuition fees
(including at the Home and Overseas rate), a living
allowance and research costs. Candidates of all nation-
alities are eligible to apply. Default start date is Sep
2021, although this is exible.
The deadline for applications is 5 Jan 2021.
== About the Project Around 10% of people are left-
handed, across all cultures and ethnicities. Althoughsidedness is observed in most species, the strong right-
ward population bias of handedness is characteristic of
humans. Human handedness correlates with language
hemispheric dominance, which typically resides in the
left hemisphere, and is thereby linked with traits re-
lated to lateralized brain function, including language
acquisition, cognition, personality, dyslexia, autism
and schizophrenia. Accordingly, explaining handedness
holds the key to understanding multiple facets of the
human experience.
Handedness has a strong biological basis and is estab-
lished during foetal development. It is also clearly heri-
table, with the prevalence of left-handedness increasing
to 19.5% and 26.1% among children born to one or two
left-handed parents, respectively, and with twin-studies
pointing to a heritability of ~25%. However, genomic
studies have identied only a small number of genes
that are associated with handedness, and these appear
to account for a very small proportion of its overall her-
itability. Accordingly, a major challenge for handedness
research is to explain the \missing heritability".
For right-handedness to predominate while left-handers
remain present at a lower - but substantial and xed -
frequency implies that there is both a basic evolutionary
advantage to right-handedness and also a frequency-
dependent advantage to individuals of the rarer type.
Such a frequency-dependent advantage has been sug-
gested to arise in relation to combat, whereby left-
handers are able to surprise opponents that are more
used to ghting against right-handers. In support of
this social-evolutionary hypothesis, a left-handedness
advantage has been observed in combat sports, and the
somewhat higher incidence of left-handedness among
men than women is consistent with combat having tra-
ditionally been a male-dominated activity.
In this social-evolutionary view of the balance between
right- versus left-handedness lies a potential explanation
for the missing heritability. Genes underpinning social
adaptations are expected to express at dierent levels
according to the parent from which they are inherited,
yet these parent-of-origin eects - so-called \genomic
imprinting" - are not considered in standard genomic ap-
proaches that seek to link genes with phenotypes. There-
fore new theoretical models and analytical approaches
are need to understand the biology of handedness. The
project aims to identify new genes contributing to hand-
edness, and to develop a completely novel framework for
the integration of theoretical and empirical approaches
in the study of social traits more generally.
This is a unique opportunity for a fully-funded inter-
disciplinary PhD project that will combine social evo-
lutionary theory and genome analysis to establish the32 EvolDir January 1, 2021
role for parental genotype in deciding an individual's
handedness. Training will be provided in both areas of
the project. The PhD researcher will work under the
supervision of Prof Andy Gardner (School of Biology)
to develop novel mathematical models to formalise this
social-evolutionary hypothesis and thereby derive ex-
plicit predictions as to patterns of gene expression for
genes that promote versus inhibit the development of
left-handedness. Genetic analysis on already-available
datasets will be supervised by Dr Silvia Paracchini's
(School of Medicine)
The successful applicant will have an undergraduate
degree in Biology or other relevant subject, an ability
for logical and creative thinking, and a passion for evolu-
tionary genetics and multidisciplinarity. We particularly
encourage applications from women and from BAME
individuals.

UStirling OysterGenomics
This 4 year PhD project is part of a competition funded
by EASTBIO BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnership.
This opportunity is open to UK and International stu-
dents and provides funding to cover stipend and UKlevel tuition (Please state if your institution will provide
funding to cover the dierence in fees). Please refer
to UKRI website and Annex B of the UKRI Training
Grant Terms and Conditions for full eligibility criteria.
The prospective student will be part of a multidisci-
plinary group at the Institute of Aquaculture in the
University of Stirling and at The Roslin Institute and
will acquire expertise in bivalve biology and genetics.
The student will initially analyse the currently avail-
able datasets, by using statistical and bioinformatic
tools, to build hypothesis of domestication signatures in
the oyster populations to then further analyse publicly
available sequencing data, pick out informative SNPs
and potentially develop a low-density panel to facili-
tate the screening of oyster samples. The student will
also oversee the functional analysis of genes in the iden-
tied genomic regions using gene expression proling,
which will give us a better idea of potential biological
mechanisms underlying the selection signatures
This is a full-time PhD Project
About the Project:
Aquaculture has become a fast-growing industry called
to play a crucial role in future food production. Among
a vast number of aquaculture species being cultured,
Pacic oyster is the most widely farmed oyster species,
providing socio-economic benets to many coastal com-
munities and generating yearly revenues at approxi-
mately US $1.2 billion worldwide (FAO, 2018).
The domestication process by which wild animals or
plants adapt to human-altered environmental conditions
is recent in aquaculture species compared to terrestrial
animals. However, the practice has expanded quickly
over the past few decades and breeding programs have
been stablished for many important aquaculture species
such as Atlantic salmon, tilapia, rainbow trout, among
others. These breeding programs have been focused on
the improvement of productive traits, i.e. growth rate.
A positive (natural or articial) selection causes pheno-
typic changes in the organisms but also underlying ge-
netic changes involving an increase in the frequencies of
favourable allelic variants and, consequently, a decrease
of genetic variation in the loci under selection which
with time will leave signatures of selection noticeable
at the genome level. In particular, more information
is needed to understand how selection practices have
aected Pacic oyster populations, globally, in terms of
levels of inbreeding, genetic diversity and the genomic
regions/genes under selection.
The reduction of genetic diversity in a population may
aect disease resistance and the adaptability to envi-
ronmental changes (Allendorf, 1980). Therefore, it isJanuary 1, 2021 EvolDir 33
crucial to survey the genetic diversity within or between
selected lines and wild populations for successful hatch-
ery management of species. Breeding companies face
a challenging problem on how to keep genetic diversity
over generations. Analyses of these selection signatures
in domestic animals can provide further insights into the
genetic basis of adaptation to diverse environments and
genotype/phenotype relationships. The development
of genetic markers for monitoring the genetic variation
in wild populations and selected lines is highly desired.
The identication of such regions under selection is im-
portant since they would highlight loci that are linked
to economically relevant characteristics such as growth,
disease resistance or adaptation to environments.
Next-generation sequencing and high-throughput geno-
typing technologies play a fundamental role in genetic
studies by for example allowing the development of
genomic resources such as the identication of single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or the quantication
of mRNA expression levels, making possible the com-
parison of multiple samples or populations.

AncientMetagenomicsMethods
PhD research fellowship to develop sedimentary ancient
DNA bioinformatic methods at the Arctic University
Museum of Norway in Tromso, supervised by Assoc.
Prof. Peter Heintzman.
Ancient DNA extracted from sediments and other en-
vironmental sources is an emerging and fast-moving
eld that has the potential to revolutionize our abil-
ity to reconstruct past communities at unprecedented
temporal resolution. However, computational methods
for processing, identifying, and analyzing total ancientDNA from sediments are still rudimentary. The goal of
the position is to therefore develop novel bioinformatic
methods for the optimal processing of metagenomic
sequence data generated from complex and degraded
biological remains. The project will use a combination
of published and recently generated data sets from lake,
cave, permafrost, and archaeological sites across the
Pleistocene and Holocene of Europe, Asia, and North
America, as well as simulated data sets to test and verify
the developed methods. You will gain expertise in bioin-
formatics, metagenomics, ancient DNA/palaeogenomics,
molecular biology, palaeoecology, and analysis of large
genomic data sets.
The position is for a period of four years, of which three
years are dedicated to research. The fourth year is dis-
tributed as 25% each year, and consists of teaching,
outreach, sys-admin work, and/or other duties for the
Arctic University Museum.

Junior Group Leader Wissenschaftliche/r Mitarbeiter/in
(Salary level TV-L E13, 100%)
in the Plant Adaptation-in-Action group, headed by Prof
Shuqing Xu (https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/-
plantadapt/people/shuqingxu.shtml). The successful
candidate may start as soon as possible, preferably be-
fore May 2021. The salary will initially be provided for
three years, with possibility of extension. The emer-
gence of agricultural pests and their resistance to pes-
ticides is a remarkable example of rapid adaptation in
a human-mediated evolutionary experiment. The Col-
orado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata),
an insect with little practical signicance to crops 150
years ago, is now a devastating global pest of potato and
other solanaceous crops and has evolved resistance to40 EvolDir January 1, 2021
nearly all known insecticides. The remarkable resistance
to insecticides and relatively short and well-known nat-
ural history thus make CPB an ideal system to study
the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and evolution-
ary processes of agricultural pests. In this DFG-funded
project, the candidate will lead a team to investigate
the evolution of CPB and the mechanisms of insecticide
resistance using interdisciplinary approaches.
During the course of the project, the candidate will ma-
ture his/her scientic skills and develop independence
in project planning and management skills. In addition,
the candidate will gain the opportunity to improve their
leadership skills by leading a research team consisting
of one PhD student and several MSc and BSc students.
The position serves as a stepping-stone for the candidate
to pursue a faculty position.
Requirements: We are looking for a highly motivated re-
searcher with a doctoral degree, or equivalent thereof, in
biology, evolutionary genomics, bioinformatics or com-
puter science. The candidate is expected to design, con-
duct and organize a large whole-genome resequencing
project and conduct experimental work with high degree
of independence. Thus, a background in bioinformatics
and evolutionary genomics is required. Applicants must
demonstrate experience in statistics and population ge-
nomics. Experience with pesticide resistance, animal
evolutionary ecology, plant-herbivore interactions and
molecular genetics are a plus. Our group consists of
people of various nationalities and teamwork is essen-
tial for all projects in the group. Therefore, excellent
communication skills, as well as prociency in spoken
and written English are expected. Good knowledge in
German is a plus.
The University of M unster is an equal opportunity em-
ployer and is committed to increasing the proportion
of women academics. Consequently, we actively encour-

is committed to employing more sta with disabilities.
Candidates with recognized severe disabilities who have
equivalent qualications are given preference in hiring
decisions, although some restrictions related to specic

The new research group of Andreas Wallberg is seeking
a motivated candidate researcher with strong interests
in evolutionary genomics. The successful candidate will
join the group to carry out population genomics in ma-
rine zooplankton, including krill and copepods sampled
across dierent oceans.
The Wallberg group studies multiple keystone species
of krill and copepods of crucial importance to marine
food webs and our research is motived by the poor state
of knowledge of zooplankton and crustacean genomics
in times of a rapidly changing world ocean.
The project that the successful candidate will join seeks
to map and compare genome function and variation
across the genomes and natural ranges of dierent
species, using a combination of short-read and long-
read techniques and analytical methods. The main aim
of the project is to advance our insights into how these
plankton is genetically adapted to their environment, in-
cluding the identication of genes and mechanisms that
contribute to adaptation, in order to better understand
how they may respond to continued climate change.
Type of employment: Full-time, temporary position

rhopkins@fas.harvard.eduInMemoriam FrankWright
I am very sad to pass on news of the death of Frank
Wright of Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland.
Frank's long struggle with health problems ended on
the morning of 15th December.
Frank's contribution to research was immense, cover-
ing many topics including codon usage, phylogeny and
recombination.
Many of us around the world also remember Frank's
friendship, loyalty and humour, his kindness and enor-
mous desire to help others.
Frank had a passion for training, informal and formal,
and always had something insightful to say about any
phylogenetic technique. Frank loved his work and was
full of stories about his work and supportive colleagues.
It was a privilege to know him and work with him.
Frank's family are planning a small family funeral soon,
with a larger celebration of Frank's life when such things
become possible.
Please feel free to pass the sad news on to others. If you
would like to be in touch with Frank's family, please let
me know.

countries. The CRG shares principles of an interdisci-
plinary, motivated and creative scientic team that is

an HR Strategy for Researchers designed to bring the
practices and procedures in line with the principles of
the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of
Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
For further information, see https://www.crg.eu/ .
About the groupOur group is particularly interested in how the evolu-
tion and survival of cancer cell populations relies on
mutation inux as well as in the selection inference from
allele frequency information. To this end, we develop
mathematical and computational approaches to esti-
mate mutation rates and selection. Estimates of the
strength of selection in cancer allow for a prioritization
of genes and non-coding regions by their disease rele-
vance, with the ultimate goal of promoting therapeutic
advances.
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population ge-
netics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity.
We have recently demonstrated that coding sequences
of cancer tumors not only exhibit positively selected
mutations that drive cancer (www.nature.com/articles/-
s41588-019-0572-y), but that there exist genes that the
tumor cannot aord to lose to the mutational pres-
sure (www.nature.com/articles/ng.3987). In addition
to genes, we have also identied cancer driver loci in
the non-coding part of the genome (www.nature.com/-
articles/s41467-017-00100-x), which is another active
ongoing research eort in the group.
We have also studied mutation and selection in the
framework of human polymorphisms (www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3831; academic.oup.com/mbe/article-
abstract/36/8/1701/5475505) and de novo variants
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17162-z). Here,
a particular focus of the group lies on the description
of purifying selection in humans and across species,
accounting for mutational processes as well as the
eects of genetic drift.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling lab was estab-
lished in October 2018 and is part of the \Bioinformatics

ComparativeGenomics
Postdoc in comparative genomics
We are looking for a highly motivated researcher for
an 18 month postdoctoral position collaborating in an
exciting project on comparative genomics of marine sh
and shellsh species. In the project, we use genome
resequencing data from a range of species to reconstruct
the demographic history and characterize genomic sig-
nals associated with population divergence and local
adaptation in high gene ow scenarios. The work will
improve our understanding of interacting evolutionary
processes and provide valuable data for securing sus-
tainable management and conservation of exploited re-
sources. Applicants are encouraged to develop their own
research ideas within this framework.
The fellowship is part of a larger Nordic collabora-
tive project, MarGen II, nanced by the EU Interreg
~Aresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak Programme, the Danish
Rod and Net License Funds and the National Insti-
tute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua). The project
will primarily be carried out in the population genetics
group, Section for Marine Living Resources, situated
in Silkeborg, Denmark. DTU Aqua is an institute at
the Technical University of Denmark. In addition, the
position oers many opportunities for collaborating with
Nordic and other European colleagues in the eld.Qualications: The position involves bioinformatic anal-
yses of already available genome resequencing data from
a range of species with high quality reference genomes.
The overall aims are to combine information about de-
mographic history with genome scans to understand the
interacting eects of demographic and evolutionary pro-
cesses during population divergence, with a particular
focus on populations in the environmental transition
zone between the marine North Sea and the brackish
Baltic Sea. As such, a strong background in evolution-
ary biology, population genetics and bioinformatics is
important.

mation, and the built environment in insect societies.
This is a collaborative investigation which com-
bines expertise in genetics, insect behavior, gran-
ular media physics, epigenetics, and the dynam-
ics of collective actions. Students would work
jointly in the labs of Michael Goodisman (https:/-

Background. PHYTOARK - \Predicting the future from
signatures of the past: using living sediment archives
and ancient DNA to understand responses of marine
primary producers to environmental changes" - is an
interdisciplinary collaborative project that looks into
the Holocene history of the Baltic Sea to investigate past
patterns of phytoplankton biodiversity change on the
levels of communities and populations and integrates
this change with Holocene and Anthropocene climate
warming. The results are used in ecosystem models to
develop novel tools for the assessment and prediction of
ecosystem functioning under global change. The project
will be carried out by a network of German and interna-
tional partners. Network partners within Germany are
located at the Institute of Baltic Sea Research Warne-
muende (IOW), Senckenberg Research Institute (SGN),University of Hamburg and University of Konstanz.
Postdoc - Resurrection Ecology This sub-project will
investigate intraspecic changes and potential evolu-
tionary adaptation within and among populations of
key phytoplankton species using resurrection ecology
approaches. The postdoc will be based at the Insti-
tute of Baltic Sea Research Warnemuende (IOW), with
Dr. Anke Kremp. Application deadline January 8th,

PortlandStateU SomaticMutation
Postdoc position: Genomics of Somatic Mutation Accu-
mulation and Clonal Evolution in /Mimulus/
A postdoctoral position is available in the Cruzan lab
at Portland State University as part of a collaborative68 EvolDir January 1, 2021
NSF-funded project focused on understanding the con-
sequences of clonal evolution and natural selection on
somatic mutation accumulation in plants. Mutation ac-
cumulation is intrinsically dierent in plants compared
to animals, because the same germ cells that subtend
vegetative growth are responsible for gamete production.
Somatic mutations can occur with each mitotic division
during stem growth; consequently, plants have enormous
potential to accumulate mutations, but the eects of
these mutations on adaptation is unknown. This project
will use genomic and greenhouse experiments to identify
the tness consequences of somatic mutations for plants
in the next generation, using /Mimulus/ as a model
system.
A PhD in evolutionary genetics or a related eld is
required. We seek an individual with experience and
expertise in at least two of the following: genomics,
bioinformatics, and plant biology. The ideal candidate
will be independent, highly motivated, productive, and
able to work eectively in a team with members from
a variety of diverse backgrounds.In addition, the suc-
cessful candidate will have an excellent understanding
of experimental design and a proven publication record,
and they will have intellectual purview over the design
and implementation of experiments. This work will
be conducted in collaboration with PIs, graduate, and
undergraduate students at Portland State University

evolution of plant pathogens. To understand various
factors involved, we study both wild plant pathosystems
as well as agricultural systems. In the lab we work with
various cereal pathogens and several pathogens on wild
and domesticated Solanum species. We apply compara-
tive genomics and population genomics approaches to
understand the biology of the host and the pathogens
and the factors that govern their evolution.
For this project, we are looking for a postdoctoral re-
searcher to investigate the genetic diversity of a crop
pathogen. The applicant must have a PhD and have
an interest in ecological modeling and/or population
genomics. Experienced with NGS data analysis is an
advantage. Excellent English skills, both written and
spoken, are essential.
The project will be carried out in the group of Dr.
Remco Stam at the Chair of Phytopathology (Prof. Dr.
Ralph H uckelhoven). The chair hosts several research
groups studying the biology of plant pathogen interac-
tion and is well equipment to study defence responses
on dierent levels. The project is in collaboration with
a leading company in plant breeding and agrochem-
istry and benets from access to their genetic resources
as well as many active collaborations in the eld of
population genetics and genomics and access to state-
of-the-art resources on the TUM Life Science Campus
in Freising-Weihenstephan.

UBern EvolutionHybridization
Dear EvolDir Community,
The Division of Theoretical Ecology and Evolution at
the University of Bern, led by Claudia Bank, is looking
for an
Advanced Postdoc in Ecological and Evolutionary Mod-
eling of Hybridization (50-100%)
to be part of a team working on the collaborative HFSP-
funded project \Chance or curse? The consequences of
hybridization in a changing world" (see also the simul-
taneous postdoc opportunity in Vitor Sousa's lab at the
University of Lisbon, https://bit.ly/OpenCall-EG-cE3c-
Dec2020).
Once thought to be rare, we now know that hybridiza-
tion is quite common. There has been a longstanding
debate about the importance of hybridization because it
can have both benecial and harmful eects. By creat-
ing new phenotypes, hybridization can help organisms
adapt, but it can also drive extinction by generating
harmful combinations of genes. Past work has pro-
posed that in stressful environments, the benets of
hybridization may outweigh the costs, but this idea has
not been clearly tested. Understanding these dynamics
has become more pressing as rates of hybridization have
increased due to the stresses of rapidly changing envi-
ronments. In collaboration with Drs. Molly Schumer,
Chelsea Rochman, and Vitor Sousa, we will combine di-
verse and multidisciplinary expertise to tackle fundamen-
tal questions about the consequences of hybridization
via eld observations, laboratory experiments, compu-
tational tools, and mathematical models.
We are looking for a postdoc with proven expertise in
ecological/eco-evolutionary modeling, preferably with
at least 2 years of postdoctoral experience. They will
develop models and approaches to predict the outcomes70 EvolDir January 1, 2021
of hybridization by incorporating interacting and se-
lected genetic loci into ecological models of hybrid pop-
ulations in isolation or in a spatial environment. The
ideal candidate is open to exploring both mathematical
approaches and large-scale simulations that take into
account ecological variables in order to quantify extinc-
tion probabilities and other evolutionary outcomes. In
addition to independently developing this project, the
desired candidate is keen to contribute their expertise
to other projects in the lab (and in the collaborative
team) and open to mentoring occasional undergraduate
and Masters students with interest in the topic.
We provide a dynamic and interdisciplinary work
environment within the research group (Division
of Theoretical Ecology and Evolution, former
Evolutionary Dynamics Group), within the Insti-
tute of Ecology and Evolution in Bern (https:/-
/www.iee.unibe.ch/), and within the collaborator
team (Molly Schumer, Stanford University, https:/-
/schumerlab.com/; Chelsea Rochman, University of
Toronto, https://rochmanlab.com; and Vitor Sousa,
University of Lisbon, https://ce3c.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/-
member/vitorsousa). If desired by the candidate, short
or mid-term visits of the collaborator labs are encour-
aged, and the candidate is expected to present and
discuss their work at international workshops and con-
ferences. The salary will be commensurate with qual-
ications and experience, according to the University
of Bern statutes. Funding for this position is currently
available for 3 years. Our lab philosophy includes open
communication, regular individual meetings and evalu-
ation of mentoring and career development needs, and
prioritising the well-being of all lab members.
Contact and Application
If interested, please send a complete CV, a motivation
letter explaining the t for the position, and the desired
starting date ( <1 page), a statement of research inter-
ests and approaches ( <1 page), and names of 3 referees

Evaluation of the applications will begin immediately
and continue until the position is lled, with a desired
starting date as early as possible. Following the Univer-

understand the impact of evolutionary history on
genetic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and disease. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human
history, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomic
datasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.
Required qualications: Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics,
genomics, computational biology or related elds and
demonstrated record of productivity and publications.
Experience with programming (e.g. C/C++, Python/
Perl, R or other programming languages), genomic data
analysis and methods development.
Please contact Priya with your CV and a brief overview
of research questions you are interested in pursuing.
Please also request three recommenders to send a letter
of reference on your behalf.
Salary: This is a multi-year postdoctoral position (initial
appointment is for 12 months and renewable annually
up to three more years). Salary is commensurate with

UCLouvain Insect Learning for Rapid Adaptation to
changing habitats
Postdoc position in Evolutionary Ecology
We are looking for highly motivated candidates to apply
for a 2 to 4-year postdoctoral position, funded through72 EvolDir January 1, 2021
UCLouvain university (\Action de recherche concert ee"),
in the laboratory of Prof Caroline Nieberding (https://-
nieberdinglab.be/, UCLouvain, Belgium).
Animals were long thought not to learn. Over the years
research has, however, revealed that most animals do
learn to some extent. This paradigm shift has led to the
hypothesis that learning is a form of behavioural plas-
ticity that participates to rapid adaptation of natural
populations in nature, in response to human induced
habitat degradations. Yet, the adaptive value of learn-
ing remains rarely quantied so far. This project will
quantify the adaptive value of learning in the eld in a
number of buttery species facing increasing reduction
and fragmentation of suitable habitats. Butteries are
agship and bioindicator species of the quality of Eu-
ropean natural habitats, and we have occurrence data
spanning several decades. This project aims at provid-
ing one of the rst eld-based estimates of the selective
value of learning for a key behavioural trait, oviposition
site selection (\OSS" hereafter). OSS is key to coloni-
sation of suitable habitats in butteries, the larvae of
which have only a low mobility. As learning is costly,
we expect that increased learning and memory skills are
correlated to reduced survival and/or egg production
and we will quantify potential trade-os associated with
learning and memory.
The postdoctoral research will include experiments in
the eld in Belgium and ecologically-relevant experi-
ments in the laboratory, where eld-caught animals can
be monitored. The ideal candidate for this position
will have a strong background in behavioural ecology,
statistical analyses, expertise in buttery ecology and a
capacity for creative and critical thinking. The candi-
date will have opportunities to learn some of the specic
skills required for the project by our network of national
and international collaborators. Applicants should hold
a PhD diploma. The deadline for applications is Decem-
ber 15th, or until the application is lled.
The salary will be around 2000 euro netto per month
plus benets (health insurance,...) which are included
in the Belgian system. Our University is an Equal
Opportunity/Armative Action Employer, and is in
a French-speaking region of Belgium, but the lan-

uence physiology and behavior. We use social insects
as a model system because many engage in a mouth-to-
mouth uid exchange called trophallaxis, wherein they
transmit endogenously produced molecules that can in-
uence receivers.||In many species that engage in this
behavior, every individual in the colony is connected
through this network of uid exchange. The exchanged

a means for how some social insect communities can
collectively decide on the colony's developmental pro-

circulatory system.
Our lab uses machine learning approaches in both evo-

GenomicShock
An NSF-funded postdoctoral research position is avail-
able in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology at the University of Kansas in the laboratory of
Justin Blumenstiel. The primary goal of the project is
to determine how DNA damage and the DNA damage
response shape the prole of heritable transposition in
the male and female germline during hybrid dysgenesis.
Using pooled long-read sequencing, we have recently
found that DNA damage in the female germline caused
by the excision of DNA transposons is associated with
the activation of LTR class elements. Whether this is
also the case in the male germline is not known. Thus,
one goal of the project is to compare patterns of germline
transposition between males and females where natu-
ral selection may act dierently on the mutation rate.
Using a combination of CRISPR and long-read pooled

PostDoc Position at Uppsala University - Fungal Ge-
nomics
Systematic Biology, Department of Organismal Biol-
ogy, Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University,
Sweden.
A two-year position on a Carl Tryggers post-doc stipend
is available to research fungal accessory genomes with
Dr. Aaron Vogan at Uppsala University.
*Project description:*
Species of the fungal plant pathogen *Fusarium* are
responsible for major crop losses globally through di-
rect disease and mycotoxin production. Management of
*Fusarium* disease is dicult as pathogenicity is often
conferred by non-conserved chromosomes referred to as
accessory or lineage specic (LS) chromosomes. These
chromosomes can be transferred horizontally between
strains and their rapid evolution is important for the
fungus to evade host resistance. We recently described a
family of selsh genes known as *Spoks*. The *Spoks*
are meiotic drivers, meaning they are capable of bias-
ing their transmission from one generation to the next
at frequencies above 50%, violating Mendel's law of
equal segregation. In *Fusarium*, *Spok* homologs
(*FuSpok*s) are present in high copy number on the LS
chromosomes and one *FuSpok* has previously been in-dicated to have meiotic drive function. Together, these
ndings raise the hypothesis that the *FuSpok*s selshly
inuence the spread of *Fusarium* LS chromosomes.
The overall aim of this project is to characterize the
*Fu**Spok* genes with the use of gene knock-ins in the
model fungus *Podospora anserina*. This will provide
key insights as to the role of the *Spok* genes on the LS
chromosomes in *Fusarium*, and progress towards the
long-term goal of using these genes to manage disease.
*Requirements:*
Applicants should possess a PhD degree in microbiology,
molecular biology, fungal genomics, or a related eld,
and general molecular biology laboratory skills. Experi-
ence performing transformations on lamentous fungi
are a plus. Candidates must have received their PhD
from an institute other than the Institute of Organismal
Biology at Uppsala University and cannot currently have
employment at the Department of Organismal Biology.
Prociency in spoken and written English is required.

interests and skills, and contact information for two

ComparativeGenomicsCephalopods
Two postdoc positions to study multiscale genome evo-
lution and cephalopod gene regulation (University of
Vienna, Austria)
We are seeking two postdoctoral researchers to join our
team and work on the ERC funded project \METAS-
CALE: Modes of genome evolution during major meta-
zoan transitions". The task of both positions will be
to study co-evolutionary trends within animal genomes
and their association with the emergence of new gene
regulation. Our group employs methods of compara-
tive and regulatory genomics to study the regulatory
impact of transitions in animal genome architecture.
More recently, we have identied a major genome reor-
ganization in the \smart" coleoid cephalopod molluscs
(squid, octopus, cuttlesh) that, together with other
genomic changes, potentially comprises a unique path
or mode of genome evolution among animals. We are
thus interested in quantifying these modes of genome
evolution across all available animal genomes and to test
whether their shifts are associated with the emergence
of novel regulation (e.g., in cephalopods). One of our
main model species is the Hawaiian bobtail squid species
Euprymna scolopes. The tasks of the two candidates
will be complimentary and highly collaborative with
one position focusing on comparative genomics analyses
across all metazoans and the other position on regula-
tory genomics in the squid. A solid background in in
bioinformatics and comparative genomics is highly de-
sired for the rst position, whereas the second position
will benet from experience in molecular and regulatory
genomics methods such as HiC, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq or
single cell transcriptomics.
The postdocs will join an international group and net-
work of researchers at the University of Vienna study-
ing a diverse range of species and questions in molecu-
lar evolution, development, morphology and genomics.
Our group is also part of the large evolVienna net-
work of more than 50 evolutionary biology labs in
Vienna, across several universities and research insti-
tutes. Our Faculty will be relocating to a new cam-
pus at the Vienna Biocenter in summer 2021 (https://-

historic European capital with a high QOL. Informa-
tion about postdoctoral salaries in Austria can be foundon this webpage: https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-

PolygenicAdaptation Jun13-Jul15
Towards an Integrative View of Adaptation: Bridging
Population and Quantitative Genetics
Coordinators: Alison Etheridge, Kavita Jain, Christian
Schl otterer, and Naomi Wray
Location: KITP Santa Barbara, California
Dates: Jun 13, 2022 - Jul 15, 2022
Application deadline: March, 1, 2021
https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/adapt22 The
study of adaptive evolution in molecular population
genetics and quantitative genetics have remained rather
isolated disciplines despite the shared research theme.
While quantitative genetics describes adaptation of
quantitative traits as a collective eect due to small
shifts in the allele frequencies of a large number of un-
derlying genetic loci (polygenic adaptation), molecular
population genetics has focused on adaptation due to a
small number of favorable loci in which the allele frequen-
cies sweep to xation. The connection between these
two areas became possible when molecular markers were
introduced. Since then Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)
mapping and, more recently, Genome-Wide Association
Studies (GWAS) developed into powerful approaches
to link phenotypes of interest with their genetic basis.
Furthermore, stochastic models of evolution that bor-
row techniques from statistical physics provided a link
between the bottom-up and top- down approaches in
understanding adaptive dynamics. As a result, it is now
becoming increasingly clear that both \sweeps" and
\small shifts" are rather the endpoints of a scale than
exclusive alternatives.This program will bring together theoreticians and em-
piricists to develop the basis for a unied framework of
adaptive genetic architectures. The new framework will
integrate molecular population genetics and quantitative
genetics, addressing three main questions:
1. What are the dierent adaptive scenarios that need
to be distinguished and what are their dening charac-
teristics?
2. What are the key factors that determine these sce-
narios?
3. How can we develop powerful statistical tests to
detect polygenic adaptation from empirical data?
KITP programs provide a fantastic opportunity for sci-
entic exchange and interdisciplinary collaboration.
A typical day starts with 2 lectures and includes ample
opportunity for discussion. In the afternoon we will have
discussion groups and workshops on specic subtopics
as well as bottom up activities of the participants. Long-
term participants will be provided oce space at KITP.
The scientic activities will be accompanied by joint
social events such as BBQ, wine tasting or beach vol-
leyball. Social and scientic interactions are facilitated
with many long-term participants staying at the Munger
Physics Residence.
Because the program encourages scientists to stay as
long as possible, KITP has several family friendly mea-
sures in place ( https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/visitors/-
before-your-visit/family-fund).
We are aiming to gather a stimulating group of par-
ticipating scientists covering the full spectrum from
theoreticians to experimentalists. Female scientists and
representatives of minority groups are particularly en-
couraged to apply.

and structural genetic variation. The instructors will
guide the participants from the handling of raw genomic
data and data exploration (e.g., summary statistics and
population structure) up to more advanced methods,
including genotype-environment associations based on
both sequence and structural variants. Through hands-
on exercises, the course will teach basic bioinformatics
skills and how to manipulate, visualize and interpret
genomic data and patterns.
Learning Outcomes
1) Handling genomic data from raw reads to genetic
variants
2) Calculating basic population genetic statistics
3) Visualizing genetic population structure
4) Searching for signatures of selection in the genome
5) Accounting for putative structural variants
6) Understanding the potential and the limitations of
dierent methods to study the genomic basis of adapta-
tion

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
