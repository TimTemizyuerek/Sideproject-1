Dear Colleagues,
The IDPfun consortium is happy to invite you to its
fourth All Hands Meeting \Machine Learning and Pro-
tein Structural Disorder", to be held in Dublin (Ireland)
from August 29 to September 2, 2022.
The meeting will bring together the members of the
MSCA RISE project IDPfun - Driving the functional
Characterization of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins,
the ELIXIR IDP community, and the participants of
CAID 2 (Critical Assessment of protein Intrinsic Disor-
der).
This meeting aims at the description of the relationships
between IDPs by combining experimental data and ma-
chine learning approaches, as a necessary and timely
step to understand their evolution, function and struc-
tural ensembles properties, as well as raise the awareness
about IDPs in the scientic community, which have been
based on globular proteins for many years. It requires
the joint eort of scientic teams with dierent expertise
(structural biologists, data scientists, computer scientists
and bioinformaticians).

SMBE CallProposals Host2025
Dear Colleague:August 1, 2022 EvolDir 7
Want to meet like-minded colleagues from all over the
world?
Wish you could have an international conference in your
eld closer to home?
SMBE is accepting proposals to host its International
meeting in 2025. Informal expressions of interest should
be from a prospective local organizing committee of
scientists headed by an SMBE member and should be
emailed to us ASAP. Full proposals will need to be sub-
mitted to the Society's Executive Administrator Lulu
Stader at Smbe.contact@gmail.com using the SMBE
template by *30 October 2022*.
For details of meeting organization, please see the
*SMBE Conference Guidelines* <https://t.e2ma.net/-
click/5vv9o/9ik3r1/x9cmuf >(*and specically Ap-
pendix 2 which outlines the format of proposals*).
In addition, please include details for a hybrid confer-
ence to be held at least partially online and a backup
plan in case the meeting cannot be held in person.
Once a location is chosen, the local organising commit-
tee will be responsible for the academic program and
the overall conference budget. The Society and the local
organizers will hire an international professional confer-
ence organizing rm who will work together with the
local organizers to secure facilities, develop a website,
and advertise the meeting.
SMBE rotates its meetings geographically to encourage
international participation. The next two meetings will
be in and Ferrera, Italy (2023) and Mexico (2024). For
2025, we are particularly requesting *proposals from
*outside* Europe and North America*.
Please note that SMBE is not interested in proposals
from professional conference organizers.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Kateryna Makova President-Elect, SMBE

Dear colleagues,
This is a reminder that the SMBE Everywhere GS3

to ensure you gain access in time.
Symposium Abstract: Dierent types of mutations vary
in their rate of occurrence, a phenomenon known as
mutation bias. Such biases are well understood to exert
directional inuences on patterns of neutral genetic vari-
ation. However, mounting evidence also supports a role
for mutation bias in guiding the direction of adaptive
evolution. Theoretical modeling has shown that adap-
tive evolution can enrich for mutationally-favored but
selectively sub-optimal alleles, and recent empirical stud-
ies have found biases among documented adaptive sub-
stitutions consistent with these theoretical predictions.
In particular, these studies have shown that mutation
types favored by a handful of specic biases, such as
transition-transversion bias and CpG hotspots, are also
statistically overrepresented among adaptive amino acid
substitutions. However, a number of key questions re-
main unanswered regarding how mutation and selection
interact during adaptive evolution. For instance, the
roles of dierent types of mutation bias in adaptation are
not well understood. These include context-dependent
biases involving anking nucleotides, spatial heterogene-
ity in mutation rates across the genome, idiosyncratic
mutation signatures driven by either endogenous pro-
cesses or external environmental exposures, and her-
itable variation in mutation biases as often observed
in mutator strains or even in dierent human popula-
tions. This symposium will showcase recent advances
in understanding the complex interplay between muta-8 EvolDir August 1, 2022
tion and selection in shaping molecular adaptation, and
will include contributions from a wide array of systems
including experimental evolution, protein evolution, par-
allel adaptation and evolutionary prediction, evolution
of drug and pesticide resistance, and cancer.

AuburnU PineConservation
I am looking to ll a fully funded PhD assistantship in
the College of Forestry, Wildlife, and Environment at
Auburn University, starting Fall/Spring of 2022/2023.
Research in the lab is broadly focused on conservation
and ecological genetics and typically relies on whole
genome sequencing data and bioinformatic tools. Cur-
rent research in the lab includes investigation of the
genomic determinants of tness, understanding the com-
plexities of population recovery from recent crashes, and
developing methods for eciently tracking individual
movement in large populations. (Please see the lab web-
page for additional information about on-going work <
http://wp.auburn.edu/willoughbylab/ >.)
The applicant hired to ll this position will focus on
the genomics of an emerging fungal pathogen of pine,
a critical timber resource in the southeastern U.S. In
particular, the student hired for this work will develop
a project to understand the evolutionary history and
origins of this pathogen in this new host species with an
emphasis on understanding the phylogeography of this
species across the southeastern U.S. landscape. Current
plans involve collection of ~250 fungal samples from
each of 5 southeastern U.S. states and generation of
sequencing data using the MinION platform, but this
could be expanded to suit student interests.
This project is part of a large, interdisciplinary and12 EvolDir August 1, 2022
multi-institutional collaboration that includes gradu-
ate students, postdocs, and scientists from Auburn and
the Forest Service. Because of this, the ability to com-
municate across disciplines is a critical skill needed to
complete this project. Although familiarity with bioin-
formatics and molecular techniques is desirable for this
position, previous experience in this area is not required.
Please do not self-select yourself out of applying as there
are many ways to acquire skills that will set you up for a
successful graduate experience. Diversity and inclusion
are a high priority of this lab group; all interested appli-
cants are encouraged to get in touch with me directly
prior to applying to the graduate program. To do so,
please send me an email (janna.willoughby@gmail.com)
with your background and interests and a pdf of your
CV. Applications will be evaluated on a rolling basis.
Auburn University is a very high research activity in-
stitution located in a mid-sized city in the foothills of
the Appalachian Mountains. Local attractions include
farmers markets, Auburn City Fest, and the newly con-
structed Gouge Performing Arts Center. The nearby
Kreher Forest Ecology Preserve and Tuskegee National
Forest oer additional recreational opportunities year-
round. Successful applicants for this assistantship will
be prepared to take on a new research project that
combines molecular lab work with bioinformatics. For
interested students, outreach and science communica-
tion opportunities can be made available, in support of
the land-grant mission of Auburn University. Graduate
students in the College of Forestry, Wildlife, and Envi-
ronment are provided with a competitive stipend and
tuition remission.

Barcelona GeneNetworkEvolution
Graduate (PhD) position
Gene networks and the evolution of organismic complex-
ity.
1.Basic job and project description:
The position is the Autonomous University of Barcelona
(UAB), Spain
-The main project questions are:
How gene networks evolved to lead to the evolution ofcomplex and robust phenotypes?
Can be uncover some principles on how gene networks
wired over evolution to reach such complexity?
How these principles aect the tempo and mode of
evolution.
Any other question of the applicants interest that are
related to the previous questions.
We will use computational models of gene networks dur-
ing development and computational models of evolution
by natural selection to study such questions for the case
of organismic complexity (e.g. anatomy). The models
we develop are genotype-phenotype maps, relating ge-
netic changes to phenotypic variation. These models
are based on realistic gene network models of pattern
formation and morphogenesis that lead to realistic 3D
multicellular (animal) phenotypes. So actual embryonic
and adult morphologies arise from our models, either
of specic organs (e.g. teeth, wings, limbs) or generic
embryo-like morphologies.
The position is in Salazar-Ciudad's group and it entails
obtaining a PhD degree.
2. Background of the project:
There is no consensus denition of complexity, yet it is
evident that organisms are complex and explaining such
complexity is one of the most fundamental questions of
biology. Morphological complexity has not increased in
the evolution of all lineages and, in general, it is unclear
whether there is a general trend of increasing complexity
in evolution. Yet, one may ask about the mechanisms
by which such complexity has increased in the lineages
where it has increased. How complexity increases dur-
ing evolution is necessarily related to development: any
evolutionary change in morphology is rst a change in
the development that produces such morphology.
It has been argued that, in spite of the remarkable mor-
phological complexity of organisms, their development is
achieved through a limited number of cell behaviors and
types of cell interactions. These cell behaviors would be
cell division, cell adhesion, cell death, cell growth, cell
contraction, extracellular signal and matrix secretion,
extracellular signal reception and cell dierentiation.
In addition to cell behaviors, development involves in-
teractions between cells, either mechanical or through
extracellular signalling.
The questions we want to approach in this study are:
how should these interactions and cell behaviors be co-
ordinated to produce complex and robust morphologies
in evolution? The question is, then, whether there are
some logical requirements that developmental mecha-
nisms should fulll in order to lead to complex robustAugust 1, 2022 EvolDir 13
morphologies. Are there, for example, some require-
ments at the level of gene network topology or at the
level of cell behaviors and their coordination during
development? How do these requirements arise in evo-
lution?
If, as suggested above, pattern transformations in de-
velopment involve a limited set of cell behaviors and
cell interactions, then any mathematical model imple-
menting those and intracellular gene networks should
be able to reproduce, to a large extent, the range of pat-
tern transformations possible in animal development. In
this project we will use one such model, EmbryoMaker
(Marin-Riera et al, 2015)^ a, to simulate a large number of
possible developmental mechanisms and try to discover
what, if anything, do the mechanisms leading to robust
complex morphologies have in common.
3. Job description
The main tasks of the student include using existing
models of embryonic development (e.g. EmbryoMaker)
in order to simulate the development of complex mor-
phologies. These models will be combined with models
of evolution, in a population context with mutation,
genetic drift and natural selection on morphology (see
for example Salazar-Ciudad and Marin-Riera, 2013).
The gene networks found to lead to the development
of complex and robust phenotypes in evolution would
be analyzed to extract general regularities, if any, these
gene networks need to fulll. The main tasks, thus,
consist in simulation, theorizing, data analysis, cod-
ing, literature searching, writing and presenting results
in conferences. We seek candidates highly motivated
for theoretical work and data analysis with a broad
understanding of the evolutionary theory and/or devel-
opmental biology and/or modeling.
4. Requirements:
- Candidates should have a University Degree and a
Master's Degree in biology, or similar, within the Euro-
pean Higher Education System (minimum 300 ECTS)
or equivalent by September 2021.
- Scientic programming skills or a willingness to acquire
them is required.
- The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.

We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student to
participate in the project: \Unveiling the mechanisms
used by invasive ants to adapt to current and future
environmental conditions". The project will be carried
out at the Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish
Academy of Sciences in Warsaw (Poland) under the
supervision of dr Magdalena Witek and dr Iago San-
mart n-Villar. The project is nanced by the National
Science Centre, which ensures a PhD student with a
monthly tax-free research stipend of 5000 PLN for the
rst two years and 3654 PLN gross for the two last years
funded by a Doctoral School fellowship.
Project description: Behaviour constitutes the rst
mechanism allowing invasive species to adapt to the
introduced areas because it allows them to cope with
new problems and pressures. Behavioural plasticity and
cognitive traits are correlated in several species with
brain complexity. The production and maintenance
of sensory, neural, and regulatory mechanisms allow-
ing plasticity involves elevated costs, which suppose aAugust 1, 2022 EvolDir 15
trade-o with resource allocation in other traits. Social
insects could cope with these costs if their behavioural
plasticity is based on social communication rather than
on individual traits. Species living in vast supercolonies
as the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) might pos-
sess the largest advantages in information transmission
about environmental use and thus, in adaptation and
invasiveness. Unravelling whether the source of plas-
ticity originates at the individual (brain-cognition) or
collective (social information transmission) level should
be a priority for understanding the invasive potential
in social insects. Invasiveness could also be aected
by predicted environmental changes, i.e. species would
have to adapt to new areas introduced but also to new
changes in those areas. Virus infections and temperature
uctuations seem to be the most changing and drastic
future events foreseen. Both behaviour and infection
potential are conditioned by temperature. Disentan-
gling, how virus infection and temperature uctuations
aect brain-behavioural plasticity would help to under-
stand how supercolony invasiveness will be aected in
the near future. We propose to unravel if behavioural
plasticity and problem-solving are correlated with brain
development or social information in the Argentine ant
and in a native species and how these traits are aected
by environmental stressors such as virus infection and
temperature uctuations.
Requirements: Successful candidates should have a Mas-
ter's degree in Biology/Ethology/Ecology. The candi-
date should have a strong background in evolutionary
biology and animal behaviour as well as respect for wild
and captive animals. Experience in the behavioural
ecology of invertebrates (preferably in social insects),
genetic analysis, and statistics will be additional as-
sets. The candidate should have very good oral and
written communication skills in English, perseverance,
commitment, and the ability to work in a team.

FireyGeneExpressionEvolution
PhD Position in Gene Expression Evolution of Fireies16 EvolDir August 1, 2022
I invite applications for one doctoral position in
my research group at the GeoBio-Center of the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at (LMU), M unchen.
The position is part of the DFG SPP \Genomic
Basis of Evolutionary Innovations (GEvol)" (https:/-
/g-evol.com) which means that you will be part of
a large network consisting of 17 projects with 1-2
doctoral students in each project. The topic of our
project is gene expression evolution in reies (https:/-
/g-evol.com/abstracts/Abstract Catalan Hoehna.pdf).
You will be jointly supervised by Sebastian
H ohna (https://hoehnalab.github.io) and Ana
Catal an (https://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/people/-
postdoctoral researchers/catalan/index.html). This
is a research-only PhD position funded for 3 years
(no classes and teaching required but possible). The
starting date is exible between 1st October 2022
and 1st October 2023. This project focuses on gene
expression data analysis. Therefore, we strongly
encourage evolutionary biologists with a keen interest
in bioinformatics/statistics or bioinformaticians with a
keen interest in evolutionary biology to apply.
A major part of the wide phenotypic diversity that
we observe today can be explained by changes in gene
expression. Changes in gene expression have been suc-
cessfully linked to the variation of dierent trait types.
One of the most extreme dierences among species are
sexually dimorphic traits, many of which can be linked
to sex-biased gene expression. In reies, sexual dimor-
phism has evolved several times independently, which
makes reies an excellent study system for repeated
evolution. In this project we want to explore: Which
are the selective pressures acting on gene expression
divergence? Are the same genes dierentiated for other
sexually dimorphic species or does each species have
their own set of sex-specic genes? We will try to ad-
dress this question using RNA-seq of ~15 rey species
from ~6 genera (3 with extreme sexual dimorphism) and
performing specic hypothesis tests within a statistical
phylogenetic framework. These phylogenetic models
will be newly developed within this project.
Your tasks will include: - Joining our eorts to collect
rey samples - Performing bioinformatic analyses to
assemble the sex- and tissue- specic gene expression
dataset - Either developing yourself (e.g., as an R pack-
age or within RevBayes) or testing our newly developed
methods for gene expression evolution - Performing a
simulation study (e.g., using available R packages) -
Leading and performing the statistical analysis of gene
expression evolution - Writing research articles - Pre-
senting your work at international conferences
Your required skills: - A Master's degree or equivalent
in Evolutionary Biology, Bioinformatics or a similareld. - Good communication skills in English - Good
written and oral skills in English- Highly motivated and
independent working - Basic knowledge in statistical
analysis (e.g., a rst course in statistical analyses using
R) - Some experience in phylogenetics, gene expression
analyses or programming is a plus, but can be acquired
during this PhD
What we oer: - Being part of a large network of genome
evolution in insects (https://g-evol.com) - Training in
genomics and statistical analysis - Opportunities to par-
ticipate at international workshops and conferences -
Working at the LMU Munich, one of Germany's and
Europe's top Universities - standard LMU salary scheme
for doctoral students (approx. 3050 euro monthly gross
salary; approx. 1850 euro monthly net salary). - ben-
ets such as health care, 30 days of vacation per year,
pension, unemployment insurance, child support (if ap-
plicable) and parental leave.
LMU Munich is an equal opportunity employer. The
University continues to be very successful in increasing
the number of female faculty members and strongly
encourages applications from female candidates. LMU
Munich intends to enhance the diversity of its faculty
members. Furthermore, disabled candidates with es-
sentially equal qualications will be given preference.
Any questions should be directed to Sebastian H ohna
(hoehna@lmu.de). Applications, including a cover letter
which states your motivation and research idea (1 page),
current CV and names and contact details of two refer-
ees should be sent to Sebastian H ohna by the deadline

PhD opportunity - Macquarie University, School of Nat-

USING ASSISTED EVOLUTION OF NATIVE
SPECIES TO ENHANCE CONTROL OF INVASIVE
PLANTS
Despite our understanding of the nuts and bolts of evolu-
tion, eorts to use that knowledge to benet biodiversity
are largely lacking. One area of enormous potential is the
evolutionary manipulation of native species to counter
the negative impacts of invasive species. Native herbi-August 1, 2022 EvolDir 17
vores often accumulate on invasive plants and rapidly
adapt to them. Invasive balloon vines (genus Cardiosper-
mum) have a well-characterised eco-evolutionary associ-
ation with native Australian soapberry bugs (Leptocoris
tagalicus), which feed on seeds of the vines. This system
oers a unique opportunity to 'fast-track' evolution in
eective insect-host plant interactions to achieve top-
down control of invasive weeds.
A fully Australian Research Council-funded PhD project
is available in the School of Natural Sciences at Mac-
quarie University to investigate the evolutionary ecology
of soapberry bugs and their native and invasive host
plants.
The PhD student will join the Invasive Plant
Ecology and Evolution Lab (Jaco Le Roux, see
www.lerouxlab.com) and the Landscape Genetics Lab
(Rachael Dudaniec, see www.dudanieclab.weebly.com)
at Macquarie University. A domestic PhD scholarship
and all project costs are fully funded.
Applicants must be AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS or PER-
MANENT RESIDENTS.
The project will involve the use of morphological data
and genomic approaches within eld and experimental
laboratory settings. The project aims to contribute to-
wards identifying genes underlying soapberry bug traits
that enhance host plant exploitation and insect tness,
which may serve as targets for articial selection, with
the aim to control invasive plants more eciently.
Interested applicants will be highly motivated and have
experience in genetics and/or evolutionary ecology re-
search. Applicants will ideally have demonstrable skills
in next generation sequencing bioinformatics and pop-
ulation genetic analyses. This project oers eld work
opportunities in New South Wales, Queensland, and the
Northern Territory. For more information or to apply,
please send a cover letter detailing your research inter-
ests, a CV, and contact details of two referees toJaco

PhD position at Memorial University of Newfoundland
(Canada) - Caribbean Biogeography and Systematics
I am seeking a motivated PhD student to test the role
of dierent hypotheses (e.g. Cenozoic vicariance, over-
water dispersal, the GAARlandia colonization route,
in situ speciation) on the evolution and assembly of
Caribbean ora. The Caribbean is important to con-
serve because it is one of the world's top ve biodiversity
hotspots. We will compile divergence times and ances-
tral areas of Caribbean endemic plant lineages from
the literature or from our own analyses (dated phylo-
genetic trees and biogeographic modeling). With these
data we will estimate colonization and speciation rates
through time. We hypothesize that dierent speciation
rates through time could explain the absence of a time-
for-speciation eect in the Caribbean as we previously
demonstrated, and a decreased colonization rate into
the Caribbean because islands will reach carrying ca-
pacity with time. In addition, the systematics of the
genus Copernicia (Arecaceae), a radiation of 21 palm
species mostly endemic to Cuba, will be conducted using
Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS). The student will con-
duct eldwork in Cuba. We expect to nd phylogenetic
splits reecting the history of fragmentation and rejoin-
ing of Cuban paleo-archipelagos, and between Cuba
and Hispaniola. Other research questions of interest to
the student are welcome. The PhD student will work
under the mentorship of Dr. Julissa Roncal at MUN,
and will collaborate with Raul Verdecia from las Tunas
University in Cuba for the systematics of Copernicia.
Student's qualications: - A MS degree in a related
discipline (e.g. biology, botany, systematics, ecology,
molecular biology, bioinformatics) - Experience in organ-
ismic botany, phylogenetics and/or population genetics
analyses, biogeographic modeling, and bioinformatics is
highly desirable. - Excellent writing, analytical, organi-
zation and communication skills. Attention to detail. -
Written and oral prociency in English is mandatory for
international students. TOEFL or IELTS test required
for admission to the university, but not the GRE tests.
Position characteristics: Project start date is September
2022 or January 2023. The PhD program comprises
four years with an annual stipend of CAD $22,500 and
the possibility to obtain the Dean's Doctoral Award of
CAD $5,000 per year. The student is expected to teach18 EvolDir August 1, 2022
60 hours during the fall and winter semesters (Sept
through April) but not in the spring. The department
of Biology at Memorial University has 25 faculty mem-
bers and 74 graduate students. Memorial University is
Atlantic Canada's largest university oering a multicul-
tural environment. Screening will begin immediately
and will continue until the position is lled. Position
is funded by an NSERC Discovery Grant, but as part
of the student's training I encourage every student to
apply for grants and awards.
How to apply: Interested applicants should send their
CV, a one-page statement of research interests and

(SGN) is a member of the Leibniz Associa-tion and
is based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. SGN con-
ducts natural history research with more than 800 em-
ployees and research institutions in six federal states.
Within SGN, the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate
Research Centre (SBiK-F) explores the interactions be-
tween biodiversity, climate, and society. For the DFG
funded project ???Genomic Basis of Evolutionary Inno-
vations???, Senckenberg BiK-F is looking for a PhD can-
didate (m/f/d) for studying the genomic and epigenetic
basis of cuticular hydrocarbon diversity in Hymenoptera
(part time, 65%).
Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve insects as des-
iccation barrier, and chemical communica-tion signals,
representing a prime example of a multifunctional trait.
Within insects, Hymenop-tera show an astonishing CHC
prole diversity. Yet little is known about the evolu-
tionary mechanisms at the genomic and regulatory level
that give rise to this diversity.
We aim to ll this knowledge gap by applying a compar-
ative genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic approach
to study this multifunctional trait in a collaborative
project in which multiple PIs and two PhD students
are involved. In this context, the Menzel research group
at the Johannes-Gutenberg-University of Mainz and
the Feldmeyer research group at the Senckenberg BiK-
Frankfurt oer a joint PhD position (65% TV-L E13 for
three years).
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with
interest in molecular evolution, genomics, epigenetics,
and chemical ecology. The PhD project will focus on20 EvolDir August 1, 2022
the identication of gene regulatory mechanisms (in-
cluding epigenetics) governing species- and sex-specic
CHC prole variation in a total of 26 wasp, ant, and
bee species.
Your tasks: - CHC prole analysis - RNA extraction and
construction of ATAC-seq and whole-genome bisulte
sequence libraries - Bioinformatic analyses - Publica-
tion of results in internationally peer-reviewed journals
- Close collaboration with the comparative genomics
counterpart
Your prole: - Master degree in evolutionary
biology, molecular biology, computational biolo-
gy/bioinformatics or a related subject - Teamwork-
oriented, excellent communication skills with prociency
in written and oral English - Interest to collaboratively
work in an interdisciplinary team - Previous experience
with working on insects, in chemical ecology, molecular
biology, statistics, and/or bioinformatics is advanta-
geous, but not mandatory.
What is awaiting you? The successful applicant (m/f/d)
will join an international dynamic scientic environment
at the Johannes-Gutenberg-University of Mainz (JGU)
and the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research
Institute Frankfurt and will have access to state-of-the-
art laboratories and computing facilities. He/she will
work part of the time at the JGU and at the Sencken-
berg BiK-F. Both loca-tions are spatially close to each
other. The working language in both research groups is
English.
Salary and benets are according to a part-time public
service position in Germany (TV-H E 13, 65% for three
years).

determine how the widespread buttery Melanitis leda
(L.) (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) has colonized its range
and adapted to varying climates and habitats.
You would gather buttery genome samples from col-
laborators, perform DNA extraction, data management,
data analysis, and MS writing, and participate in confer-
ences. You could also carry out a laboratory experiment
on seasonal phenotypic plasticity (in India). You will re-
ceive training in genome analysis from Vicencio Oostra
(Queen Mary University, London) and attend training
courses.
We are looking for candidates with an MSc in Biology,
a demonstrated interest in evolutionary ecology and
molecular genetics, and preferably with programming
experience (e.g. R, Python). Strong interpersonal skills
and a good level of English are also important.
The Adam Mickiewicz University is among the best
institutes in evolutionary biology and ecology in Poland
and you would be part of an international team of ex-
perts with complementary skills. The doctoral school
includes coursework and requires some hours of teaching
practice. The stipend of 5000 PLZ per month (gross) is
comfortable in Poland, and Poznan is a pleasant city.
If interested, please send your CV with a cover letter, a
(draft) publication or report, and the names and e-mail
addresses of two references to fremol@amu.edu.pl before

UArkansas CnidarianNeuroEvoDevo
The Nakanishi lab at the University of Arkansas (https:/-
/wordpressua.uark.edu/nakanishi-lab/) seeks applicants
interested in pursuing an MSc or PhD in biology to
start in the Fall of 2023. The lab is interested in ad-
dressing fundamental questions in neural development,
function, and evolution (\neuro-evo-devo") by studying
the biology of early-diverging animal groups - cnidarians
(sea anemone and jellysh) in particular. Current NSF-
funded research projects in the lab use the sea anemone
Nematostella vectensis to investigate 1) the mechanism
by which a single transcription factor controls distinct
sets of target genes in dierent neural cell types, and 2)
the mechanism by which neuropeptides modulate the
timing of life cycle transition. Students may work on
these and related problems in neuro-evo-devo. Student's
specic project will be developed based on the student's
research interests and educational background, in con-
sultation with the PI of the lab. Research projects may
involve gene expression analyses (e.g. in situ hybridiza-
tion and immunohistochemistry), reverse genetics (e.g.
CRISPR-Cas9), embryology (e.g. descriptive morphol-
ogy, cell-lineage tracing and tissue transplantation), ge-
nomics (e.g. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq), and/or advanced
microscopy (confocal and electron microscopy, and live-
cell imaging). Research and teaching assistantships are
available.
Requirements: Bachelor's degree in biology or related
eld. An ideal candidate will have successfully com-22 EvolDir August 1, 2022

and global change biology.
Starting date: 01.12.2022
Position duration: 3 years
Level of activity: 100%
Work location: University of Milan, Italy
Thesis description:
An iconic sign of global warming is the retreat and
extinction of glaciers worldwide. However, lack of com-
prehensive system-level studies impairs our ability to
predict the fate of biodiversity and the functioning of
ecosystems in front of retreating glaciers. To address
such challenges,it is crucial to go beyond the traditional
approach of examining individual species in isolation and
overcoming the diculties associated with addressing
complex biogeochemical cycles and socio-ecological pro-
cesses. Our objective is to (1) Understand the evolution
of ecosystem functioning and their benets to society;
(2) Develop predictive models of ecosystem functioning,
and (3) Design systemic nature-based interventions for
mitigating the risk of ecosystem functioning collapse.
A PhD position is open in the Biodiversity Change
group of Gianalberto Losapio and Plant Biology group
of Marco Caccianiga at University of Milan. This schol-
arship is funded by the Italian National Recovery and
Resilience Plan (PNRR) of the Next Generation EU
Fund. The candidate will be enrolled in the PhD school
in Sustainable Development and Climate Change, cur-
riculum 'Health and Ecosystems'. The PhD student
will develop their own research thesis within the project
'Forecasting the consequences of glacier extinction for
ecosystem functioning'. They will work in a multicul-
tural, diverse, collaborative, and dynamic environment.
We provide great opportunities for academic and pro-
fessional training as well as acquisition of transversal
skills. We oer stimuli for developing critical thinking
and to become an independent scientist. In all, we are
both professional andempathic. Salary and benets are
internationally competitive.
Candidate prole:
We are looking for a highly motivated, enthusiastic, and
independent student with passion for nature and science.
Talented students with a master degree in biodiversity,
environmental sciences, ecology, or plant sciences inter-
ested in taking an integrative approach are particularly
encouraged to apply. Applicants are expected to have
eldwork experienceand good quantitative skills. A
high level of written and spoken English prociency is
required.
Application documents: Please send your application26 EvolDir August 1, 2022
including: (1) Curriculum Vitae, indicating education,
qualications and training path, research and work ex-
perience, list of publications, academic and professional
experience (2000 words); (2) Research Proposal includ-

Graduate positions
The transgenerational dimension of ageing: How do
parental age and environment aect ospring?
Location: Bonduriansky lab, Evolution & Ecology Re-
search Centre and School of Biological, Earth and Envi-
ronmental Sciences, UNSW. UNSW is one of Australia's
top research-intensive universities. The Evolution &
Ecology Research Centre includes labs working on a
range of topics in evolutionary ecology and genetics.
Project: How do maternal and paternal ages at breeding,and the ambient environment experienced by parents,
aect the development and tness of descendants? De-
spite over a century of research on the biology of ageing,
one intriguing aspect of ageing - the widely observed
tendency for older parents to produce ospring with re-
duced lifespan and tness - remains poorly understood.
Such eects could be a major source of variation in
individual tness, and could play a role in the evolution
of ageing. This research will address the mechanisms
mediating these eects, the roles of mothers vs. fathers,
the role of the ambient environment, and the potential
for eects to be transmitted over multiple generations.
A key goal is to gain a better understanding of the role
of nongenetic hereditary mechanisms in mediating the
eects of age at breeding on descendants' development.

work on insects, and can involve the development of
new theory. PhD students in the Bonduriansky lab are
expected to play a central role in developing their own
research questions and projects, and to be able to work
independently.
A funded PhD position is available. Applicants should
be highly motivated to pursue fundamental research, and
should have a strong academic background and previous
research experience in evolutionary biology (preferably
including publications) as well as good writing and quan-
titative skills. Both domestic and international students
are welcome to apply. If interested, please submit a
brief statement outlining why you are interested in this
project, an academic CV, and contact details for two
academic referees. The successful applicant will be in-
vited to apply through the UNSW Graduate Research

Project Description: The causes and consequences of
ancient hybridization among hares
It is now well documented that related species often
exchange genetic material in the wild. Interspecic
genetic introgression is thus a potentially important
player in biodiversity evolution, yet poorly quantied
and characterised. Modern genomics oers unprece-
dented opportunities to ll this gap and address several
questions of great importance for our understanding
of evolution: under what conditions does introgression
occur, what is the role of natural selection in promoting
or impeding it, and the origin selection? The project
will focus on species of south European hares (genus
Lepus ) that were aected by introgression from an
arctic/boreal species that they replaced in this region
during the current deglaciation. Analysing a collection
of full genome sequences and additional population ge-
netics data, this project will aim to detect and quantify
all factors modulating introgression, related for example
with sex-linked transmission and behaviour, the inter-
play between recombination rate variation and genetic
incompatibilities, positive natural selection, and coad-
aptation between genomic regions.
This project will allow the acquisition of skills in bioin-
formatics and sophisticated cutting-edge population and
evolutionary genomics, by handling large-scale genomic
datasets. This work is expected to have a general im-
pact on the understanding of speciation and evolution
through genetic exchange, broadening our understand-
ing of biodiversity beyond species inventories.

Population genomic analysis of the Aotearoa New
Zealand Yellowtail kingsh - haku for community-led
aquaculture
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student for a
project that aims to sequence the kingsh (Seriola la-
landi) genome, conduct a population genomic study, and
help prepare this species for a community-led M ~A^Aori
aquaculture initiative in Aotearoa New Zealand. Yellow-
tail kingsh - haku (Seriola lalandi) is a sh species that
is widely distributed around the inshore areas of New
Zealand and in many other parts of the warm-temperatewaters of the southern hemisphere. This species has
been an important food source for M ~A^Aori (the indige-
nous people of Aotearoa). Little is known about its
stock structure and the patterns and distribution of
genetic diversity. Kingsh / haku has been identied
as an ideal candidate for aquaculture and Ng ~A^A Iwi
i te Rohe o Te Waiariki - a community led initiative -
are developing it as a new aquaculture species. This
species has been successful farmed in other parts of
the world. The goal of this project is to determine a
reference genome of kingsh and obtain a set of genome-
wide markers. These will be used to test for population
genetic dierences, conduct a seascape genomics study,
and establish a marker set for a genomic selection pro-
gramme. A genomics approach will enable a precise
determination of gene ow levels using both neutral and
selectively important loci. This project will enable a
successful candidate to obtain a comprehensive skill set
in genomics and bioinformatics, discover new patterns
of genomic variation, gain experience engaging with re-
search and primary industries, and get to work with
and learn more about indigenous communities. This po-
sition will be based at Victoria University of Wellington
(https://www.wgtn.ac.nz ) and there will be opportu-
nities to work closely with researchers at Plant and
Food Research (http://www.plantandfood.co.nz). This
ambitious and innovative project will provide the level
of resolution needed to identify genomic regions that
have experienced selection and make precise population
genetic and demographic inferences possible.
This project will provide an excellent opportunity to
develop skills in the areas of genomics, bioinformatics
and population genetics, and how they can be used
to support community-led aquaculture developments.
The PhD student will gain experience working with two
highly active research groups and have the opportunity
to be part of Genomics Aotearoa. The PhD student
will be a member of a supportive and cooperative re-
search group and help develop population genomics and
support the aspirations of a M ~A^Aori community led
initiative. This project has been designed to progress
and support the Smart Maori Aquaculture Initiative led
by the Ng ~A^A Iwi i te Rohe o Te Waiariki towards devel-
oping a sustainable, resilient and world-class M ~A^Aori
aquaculture industry in the Bay of Plenty (https://-
smartmaoriaquaculture.co.nz/).

means to precisely and rapidly assess the impact of gene
variation on biological function or disease. As part of
our Genomics Research and Development team, you will
play a critical role in building the most comprehensivecomparative genomics application on the market. We
strive to provide users with tools powerful enough to
meet the moment of this era of big data, while present-
ing these ndings in an equally elegant and clear form.
Your contributions and innovations will directly bene-
t our clients in academic, government, and corporate
institutions, accelerating their speed to discovery, and
providing clarity in their genomic research eorts.
A central focus of this position is to utilize long-read
sequence data to model gene evolution. The rst major
priorities include evaluating and optimizing existing de
novo genome assembly algorithms using PacBio HiFi
reads, then designing strategies to align genes among
taxa. As a comparative genomics platform, these as-
semblies serve as the foundation for multiple avenues of
further research including, but not limited to: (1) iden-
tifying orthologous sequences; (2) modeling ancestral
haplotypes; (3) clarifying patterns among or between
clades of taxa (ex. Core vs. accessory genes, Methy-
lation signatures, Structural variation). Another core
component of our platform is providing users with func-
tional information thus, this position will also entail
utilizing data to ascribe and quantify features like selec-
tion and conservation across genomes.
We are seeking someone who wants to use more than
just their technical skill set: we are a group of problem
solvers drawing upon a diverse set of professional back-
grounds to lay the foundations of our start-up. We are
a collection of fearless teammates - people willing to fail
forward each day, and put aside any feelings of imposter
syndrome. We seek communicators who nd creative
ways to share their domain knowledge with the rest of
the team and our customers.

Position for research assistant on microbial communities
and transposon-insertion sequencing
Application review begins 8 August 2022
The Microbial Evolutionary Dynamics unit (https:/-
/tb.ethz.ch/research/manhart-group.html), led by Dr.
Michael Manhart (https://n.ethz.ch/ ~mimanhar), of
the Theoretical Biology Group at ETH Zurich is hiring a
research assistant to study the eects of microbial inter-
actions on mutations using random-barcoded transposon
insertions. Interactions between microbes, specically in
the form of cross-feeding in which cells exchange chemi-
cal nutrients, are believed to be pervasive in microbial
communities, such as those in the human body, the soil,
and the ocean. However, we poorly understand the
eect of these interactions on the evolution of microbial
communities, especially at the scale of mutations. The
goal of this project is to directly measure how cross-
feeding modulates the eect of mutations in a synthetic
cross-feeding community.
Description of the position: You will work on one or
more of the following tasks:
- Constructing mutant libraries in E. coli strains - Per-
forming competition experiments - Preparing sequencing
libraries
You will work collaboratively with your supervisor, Dr.
Michael Manhart, and other members of the Theoretical
Biology Group.
The workload will be set by mutual agreement with
your supervisor (up to 41 hours per week), but if you
are currently enrolled as a student, it will be limitedto 15 hours per week during the academic term per
regulations. The salary and duration of the position will
depend on your qualications and funding availability,
although we expect an overall duration of 3-6 months.
The start date is exible, but we prefer 15 September
2022 or soon thereafter.
For candidates interested in longer-term positions, there
will be the possibility of transitioning to another po-
sition in 2023 when the group moves to the Center
for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine (https://-
cabm.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University (Piscataway,
USA).
Qualications: Applicants should have previous experi-
ence in wet-lab microbiology and/or molecular biology.

1. A cover letter containing: - A narrative summary of
your education and work history, especially experiences
you feel specically prepared you or motivated you for
this position - An explanation of why you are specif-
ically interested in this position and what you hope
to gain from it - Any other details that you consider
important for evaluating your application - Where you

LMU Munich ResAssist
ButteryEvolution
RA position (deadline 31st July 2022): We are look-
ing for a motivated student research assistant to join
our project studying neuroanatomy, behaviour and
speciation in tropical Heliconius butteries. The40 EvolDir August 1, 2022
RA will join Richard Merrill's research group at
LMU Munich (https://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/-
index.html), and will work closely with our collabo-
rators at the Universidad Regional Amaz onica Ikiam
(Ecuador), the Universidad del Rosario (Colombia), and
the University of Bristol (UK).
The position is for 2.5 years, following successful assess-
ments at ~4 and ~10 months. The applicant will be
primarily based at LMU in Munich, after a period of 3
to 6 months working in our insectaries in Ecuador, and
a possible shorter visit to Bristol. As such, applicants
must be prepared to spend considerable time in the trop-
ics, be self-motivated and work well as part of a team.
In addition to buttery breeding and behavioural ex-
periments in the tropics, the work would mostly involve
antibody staining, confocal imaging and segmentation
of brains. Experience with these techniques would be
welcome, but is not required. More important is self
motivation, an interest in the evolution of brains and
behaviour, good communication and English skills, and
the ability to problem solve.
The position would suit someone interested in the evo-
lution of brains and behaviour, with a relevent MSc or
bachelors degree, who is considering pursuing a PhD.
The successful applicant will work closely with Postdocs
in the lab and will contribute to ongoing experiments,
but there is scope for independent projects. Depending
on available funding, and the right candidate, the posi-
tion could be extended to allow a PhD project in the
future.
LMU is recognized among Europe's premier aca-
demic and research institutions, being consistently
ranked among the top Universities worldwide. Within
the Division of Evolutionary Biology (http://-
www.evol.bio.lmu.de), the researcher will be part of
vibrant international communities of scientists. In addi-
tion, the researcher will join a collaborative and driven
community of Heliconius biologists. The working lan-
guage of the lab and the Division of Evolutionary Biology
is English.
The position is funded by an ERC starting grant (The ge-
netic and neural basis of reproductive isolation) awarded
to Richard Merrill. The expected salary will be equiva-
lent to that paid at the level of a PhD student (mostly
likely EV13 65%, approx. 1750 euro after tax and con-
tributions). The successful applicant could start at the
earliest from September/October 2022, but this start
date could be extended for the right candidate (and
might depend on obtaining visas). The position is open
to EU and international applicants, assuming they can
obtain the necessary work documents.
Further information about the lab can be found https:/-/www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/merrill/index.html and
links within. For relevant publications see below. Infor-
mal questions should be directed to Richard Merrill (mer-
rill@bio.lmu.de), Shane Wright (dswright@biologie.uni-
muenchen.de) or Lucie Queste (queste@biologie.uni-
muenchen.de).
Applications, made up of a *single pdf* including: i)
A short letter of motivation, ii) A current CV (includ-
ing grades) and iii) the names and contact details of
two referees, should be sent to Richard Merrill (mer-
rill@bio.lmu.de) with the subject header \HELICONIUS
RA" by 31st July 2022. Interviews will be held most
likely over zoom in the following 2 weeks.

UHamburg StaScientist
EvolCompBiol
A second job opportunity in my group: Here I am look-
ing for a computational biologist to support our research
on evolutionary genetics, genomics and peptidomics of
the adaptive immune system (especially MHC/HLA),
using both sticklebacks and humans as model systems.
My lab has recently moved to the University of Ham-
burg (Northern Germany) and we are now recruiting
new group members.
The position is a permanent, full-time sta-scientist po-
sition (postdoc-level)! (This is a dierent position than
the postdoc-position I posted two weeks ago)
*The application deadline is July 28 (very soon!)*
Please follow this link to apply online through the uni-
versity system:
https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/stellenangebote/-
ausschreibung.html?jobID6b25971438a38372950a9d28f644e02959fa84
In my group we are studying the genetic basis for vari-
ation in immunocompetence and disease susceptibility
in vertebrates, with a particular focus on the adaptive
immune system and specically the process of antigen
presentation (MHC/HLA) and recognition (TCRs). We
usually take an evolutionary perspective and aim to
understand the factors and mechanisms that maintain
genetic diversity in this context, but are also interested
in the consequences of this diversity for the individual's
health and have several ongoing collaborations with
clinical groups on specic complex diseases.
This position will particularly strengthen our work on
the genomic side, being responsible for driving our work
on the genomics of adaptive immunity in both humans
and sticklebacks forward. We require support for our
work on evolutionary and population genetics of stickle-
backs in the context of local immunogenetic adaptation
as well as in analysis of complex deep NGS data analysis
of TCR repertoires.
At the same time we also need support in our collab-54 EvolDir August 1, 2022
orative projects on genetic and functional diversity of
HLA immune genes in complex human diseases. We
have been very successful so far in applying novel con-
cepts to HLA diversity in human diseases (Arora et
al. 2019 PNAS, Chowell et al. 2019 Nat Med) and

Buttery samples
Dear Ecologists and Evolutionary Biologists,
We are looking for collaborators to sample common
evening brown butteries (Melanitis leda). This species
occurs throughout Africa and the Austral-Asian region,
and is often common. We are interested in documenting
colorations of this species during a complete year in
dierent parts of its range. The non-lethal sampling can
be done in a garden or plantation. Sampling consists of
photographing butteries against a standard grey card
in the eld, and we are also interested in a few specimens
on ethanol for genomic analysis. Maybe you already
have specimens and we could assist with photographing
them. We oer co-authorship and have funding to sup-
ply buttery traps and other needs. If interested, please
contact Freerk Molleman at fremol@amu.edu.pl.

MajorContributions EvolBiol
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
just quickly: If you take a look at the introduction
of d.futuyma's 1998 text book \evolutionary biology"
(1998, p.6-7) you will see that he credits the discipline
with major contributions to society, but actually he
lists none (is an HIV phylogeny a major contribution
to medicine?!).
so i wanted to propose to you all that we all start
emailing to both evoldir and doug one or two examples
of outstanding ndings by evol.biologists that may be
major contributions to medicine, agriculture, etc.
i start below with my two examples:62 EvolDir August 1, 2022
1) my nding in Duan&Antezana (JME 2003(57):694-
701) that one can accelerate and slow down mRNA
degradation in mammalian cells by adding and remov-
ing 5'UA3' dinucleotides to/from the RNA of interest,
respectively (duan did the bench work but called the
project \garbage" until he saw the results).
the trick has been heavily exploited in pzer's cov-
2 vaccine: ~80% of wt cov-2's UAs were removed:
412 ->86 counts). All gene-expression vaccines in
the future will likely exploit this trick. See ALNs,
etc at: www.researchgate.net/project/80-removal-of-
5UA3s-from-cov-2-RNAs-used-in-Pzers-vaccine 2)
william m.muir's epochal increasing of the egg laying
of leghorn hens by a factor of 3 through ve (5) gen-
erations of (group)selection of hen houses with largest
communal egg output (when individual selection was
stuck; Craig&Muir. Poultry Sci.1995(75):294-302).
Yes, articial selection of individuals is honored in those
futuyma pages but it has been used by humans for thou-
sands of years before evolbio became a discipline. Muir's
group selection success instead would not have been pos-
sible without both evolbio theory (starting with darwin's
marbled meat) and evolbio experimental ndings.
i hope you can come up with even better examples (i
vaguely remember that some virologists working with
foot-and-mouth disease or something managed to make
sense of some results only after they interacted with
evol.biologists).
best wishes

UParisSaclay Internship

Amandine Cornille??s group (Ecology and (epi)genomics
of fruit tree-pest interactions group, http://-

Paris Saclay is recruiting a curious, ambitious and
enthusiastic Master student to investigate the role of

stress

Project summary
Coevolutionary interactions, from the delicate co-
dependency in mutualistic interactions to the antagonis-
tic relationship of hosts and parasites, are a ubiquitous
driver of adaptation. Surprisingly, little is known about
the genomic processes underlying coevolution (Cornille
et al 2022).
>From public health, food production to conservation,
coevolution of hosts and parasite is central to address-
ing contemporary scientic challenges. Here we used
??dual RNA-seq?? approach to prole RNA expression
simultaneously in parasite and host during Dysaphis
plantaginea infestations of the wild and cultivated ap-
ples. The aim of the internship will be to investigate the
gene co-expression between the host and the parasite to
detect genes involved in coevolution. Note that several
genotypes of aphids and apples were studied, which will
allow testing for a Ghost*Gparasite interaction at the
molecular level.
Master projectThe intern will use short read Illumina data already
available for both the aphid and the apple. The intern
will trim the reads, map them to reference genomes
of both the host and the pest, count the genes and
statistically analyzed 1) dierentially expressed genes,
and 2) modules co-expressed genes depending on the
aphid and apple genotypes. This will require to run and
adapt bioinformatics pipelines available in the ECLEC-
TIC group (Dicoexpress, Magniette et al 2020). The
intern will also build regulatory gene network that are
complementary to co-expression analyses using lioness
(REF) and alpaca (REF). The results will have direct
implications for breeding programs, agronomy institutes
and industries making use of domesticated plants or
developing biological methods of parasite control. The
results will contribute to the sustainable management
of apple genetic resources.
If the time allows it, the students will also investigate
whether dierentially expressed genes showed in the pro-
moters transposable elements insertion. Transposable
elements (TEs) are indeed considered to be key players
in the adaptation of populations to stress, and to which
extent TE insertions can be associated with changes
in gene expression in the host and the parasite remain
unknown.
Note that all coded workow and data that will be gen-
erated for the project will be publicly available through
open access platforms (Github, forgemia, Dryad) at the
end of the project, providing transparency, reproducibil-
ity and replicability of the research. The results will
be submitted to journals with Open Access to provide
transparency for readers and allow other researchers
to build directly and eciently on primary work. Of
course, sucient contributions to the project will involve
co-authorship.
Methodology: Bioinformatic, genomics, evolution, sta-
tistical analyses, writing.
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the can-
didate will have skills in evolutionary genomics and
bioinformatics. He/she will not necessarily be familiar
with apple or aphid model.

PolyploidPopGenomics
***ERC-funded postdoctoral position in population ge-
nomics of whole genome duplication
Group of Ecological Genomics (Filip Kol a) Department
of Botany, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic
https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen Deadline July 25
Whole genome duplication (WGD, polyploidization) is a
ubiquitous genome-wide mutation and a dominant force
in sympatric speciation, particularly in plants includ-
ing many crops. It is usually assumed that polyploidy
poses an instant barrier to gene ow between diploid
and its polyploid derivative. Our genomic survey in wild
Arabidopsis, however, recently demonstrated rampant
gene ow across the presumable ploidy 'barrier'. Yet
evolutionary consequences of such unexpected genome
permeability and generality of this nding across plant
diversity remain elusive.
We seek a highly motivated, independent early career
researcher interested in developing a research program
within the context of an ERC-funded project. Keen in-
terest in in leading an independent research program and
a strong background in structural, statistical, and/or

EcoEvolutionaryDynamics
Postdoc in eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities
A two and half-year postdoctoral position in eco-
evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite communities is
available in Jan Hrcek's lab [ http://lab.hrcek.net ] at
the Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ceske
Budejovice, Czech Republic.
The candidate will develop a project on the interface
between population genetics and community ecology.
Our laboratory utilizes a novel experimental commu-
nity model system of wild Drosophila species and their
parasitoids from tropical Australia. We are able to
perform multigenerational laboratory microcosm experi-
ments and track eco-evolutionary dynamics in ne detail.
The candidate's project will be complementary to Jan's
ERC-CZ grant investigating relationships between the
maintenance of genetic variation within populations and
species diversity within ecological communities. These
processes are typically studied separately, but likely in-
teract to structure diversity in ecological communities.
The laboratory is an international team of PhD stu-
dents, postdocs and technicians and the applicant will
have the opportunity to work extensively with other
team members. The laboratory can provide substantial
resources and support for exceptional research. Fur-
ther, the candidate will collaborate within the PI's wide
network and establish new links for this project.
Primarily, we are looking for a candidate with experi-
ence in either (i) theoretical eco-evolutionary dynamics
modelling or ecological modelling, or (ii) population
genetic/genomic modelling. The candidate is expected
to develop models tied to our Drosophila - parasitoid
system, as well as more general models for addressing
broad questions in eco-evolutionary dynamics. The can-
didate's project can also include laboratory and eld
experiments. Candidates without experience in mod-
elling but with interest in the topic are also encouraged
to get in touch.
Interested candidates are expected to contact Jan [
janhrcek@gmail.com ] with brief motivation letter and
CV as soon as possible. Full application should in addi-
tion include contact details for three references. Review
of the applications will begin on 19th August 2022 and
will continue until the position is lled.68 EvolDir August 1, 2022
The salary of 60.000CZK/month gross + benets more
than comfortably covers living expenses in Ceske Bude-
jovice and international holiday travel, but is negotiable.
Starting date is exible, but earlier starting date is pre-
ferred. The working language is English and applicants
from all countries are eligible.

tors inuencing the ecacy of natural selection, partic-
ularly how the dominance level of selected mutations in-
teracts with the ploidy level of organisms, remain poorly
understood. A key prediction is that recessivity should
reduce selection ecacy in diploids but not haploids.
However, this is challenging to test directly in species
with a diploid-dominant life cycle. An under-explored
phylogenetic clade ideal for studying this question is
Bryophytes. Their life cycles are characterised by alter-
nating between a long haploid phase (gametophyte) and
a short diploid phase (sporophyte). The relative lengths
of the haploid and diploid phases can be appreciably
dierent across dierent species, making them ideal for
comparative analysis.
Project: With that global aim, the post-doctoral project
will evaluate how the relative lengths of the haploid and
diploid phases in the life cycle of haplo-diploid organ-
isms aect the ecacy of selection against hybridisation
between species. The successful candidate will develop
population genetics models that include selection against
multiple genetic incompatibilities with arbitrary dom-
inance under dierent types of life cycles. The model
will be studied using both mathematical analyses and
computer simulations.
The model can be extended to include: i) spatial struc-
ture, ii) dierent kinds of genetic incompatibilities, and
iii) sex chromosomes. The exact project plan will be
adjusted based on the background and interest of the
candidate. Moreover, the candidate is encouraged to
develop their own ideas within the project.
Prole: The candidate must hold a doctoral degree and
have a strong background in population genetics mod-
elling, either as a trained biologist with quantitative
skills or a trained mathematician familiar with popula-
tion genetics. The ideal candidate should be motivated,
have good communication skills, and be willing to work
independently as well as part of collaborative projects.
Prior experience in any of the following areas will be an
advantage: i) mathematical modelling of evolutionary
processes. ii) simulations (e.g. SLiM, msprime). iii)
programming skills (e.g. R, Python, bash, C). iv) expe-
rience with high-performance computing (e.g. slurm).
How to apply: i) motivation letter describing research
interests, relevant experience and interest in the position

ecology with Bicyclus butteries, a diverse genus of
African butteries that have repeatedly evolved seasonal
plasticity in wing pattern, life history and behaviour.
The postdoc positions will use methods from these 3
areas: (a) experimental approaches from evo-devo and
quantitative genetics (e.g. phenotypic assays, dissec-
tions, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, CRISPR/Cas9) (b) compu-
tational genomics (gene regulatory network inference
from RNA-seq / ChIP-seq / ATAC-seq data, population
genomics, comparative genomics, PacBio & HiC based
genome assembly) (c) natural history and ecology of
butteries (incl. eldwork in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya,
Malawi, and/or South Africa).
We seek two postdoctoral colleagues with complemen-
tary skills who are curious, keen to collaborate, and
highly self-motivated. Applicants with a PhD (or close
to completion) in evolutionary biology or a related eld
and expertise in at least one of the above 3 methodolog-
ical areas are encouraged to apply, in particular those
with strong quantitative skills. Each team member will
take ownership of particular aspects of the research pro-
gramme, while supporting colleagues with other aspects.

EcoEvolutionaryModelling
Postdoctoral position in bioenergetic and eco-
evolutionary modelling (36 months)
Summary: A 36 months postdoctoral position is avail-
able in the elds of bioenergetic modelling and eco-
evolutionary modelling of aquatic species. The objective
is to propose a projection of sh responses to climate
change and related extreme events (heat waves and asso-
ciated hypoxic events) from the individual to the popula-
tion scale and from the physiological to the evolutionary
level. This project is part of the ANR FishNess project
(Fish robustNess: a key element of population vulnera-
bility and sustainable aquaculture) involving teams from
DECOD and MARBEC, two major French laboratories
in aquatic ecology. We seek a specialist in bioenergetic
modelling (e.g. Dynamic Energy Budget model - DEB)
and/or in eco-evolutionary modelling with good theoreti-
cal and programming skills. Knowledge in ecophysiology
and/or quantitative genetics would be appreciated but
is not mandatory.
Context: Intraspecic diversity is a neglected aspect of
biodiversity, although it has been shown to play a key
role in supporting essential ecological functions (Des
Roches et al., 2018). Considered as the \hidden facet
of biodiversity", there is a need to better describe how
anthropogenic pressures will impact intra-specic vari-
ability including in marine species. FishNess investigates
the hypothesis that individual robustness to environmen-
tal conditions is a key determinant of the vulnerability of
wild sh populations to global change and shing, and of
the long-term sustainability of sh farming. The project
has successfully started in early 2022 with the produc-
tion of dierent European sea bass populations reared
in various thermic conditions in the Ifremer Palavas-
Les-Flots experimental facilities. Each population is
periodically monitored for individual growth and re-
sponse to fasting events and genotyped (Griot et al.,78 EvolDir August 1, 2022
2021). This will produce a unique and unprecedented
dataset allowing for the precise quantication of the
intra-specic variability of resources allocations, and
associated genetic components. In addition, capacities
to cope with extreme climate-related challenges will be
explored for a subset of individuals in each condition.
Intra- and inter-population covariance between resource
allocation and coping abilities will also be investigated.
Finally, all available information on this variability will
be incorporated in an eco-evolutionary population model
in order to assess the long-term vulnerability of sh pop-
ulations to global change, as well as the sustainability
of human activities they support.
Description of the position: The postdoctoral researcher
will investigate the inter-individual variability in a bioen-
ergetic DEB model parameterized for every individual
considered, using all information available at the individ-
ual level (body mass, length, fasting response, gonads'
weight, oxygen consumption, etc...). Local adaptation of
each population to each thermic condition will be evalu-
ated as well as its genetic determinants. The postdoc-
toral researcher will then use the model parameterized
for each individual to simulate their responses to ex-
treme events (heat-waves and hypoxia), and categorize
them in terms of robustness. The limited capacities of
the DEB model to correctly account for eects related to
heat-waves and hypoxic events will be highlighted. The
postdoctoral researcher will be in charge of developing
an updated DEB-model accounting for these and param-
eterized for future projects. Finally, he/she will upscale
the individual DEB model to the population level and
multiple generations, to project the eco-evolutionary
dynamics of populations under anthropogenic pressures.
The postdoctoral researcher will write publications in in-
ternational scientic journals. She/he will communicate
her/his results with partners of the FishNess project
and will apply for oral communications in international
conferences.
Working environment: The postdoctoral researcher will
be in close interaction with 3 researchers (Bruno Er-
nande, Olivier Maury and Bastien Sadoul) having exten-
sive background in sh bioenergetic and eco-evolutionary
modelling from the individual to the population level
(e.g. Marty et al., 2015; Sadoul et al., 2019, 2020, 2021;
Maury et al., 2019; Maury and Poggiale, 2013). The
position is located in Institut Agro in Rennes, France
(within the DECOD laboratory), but travelling expenses
are available to organize multiple stays in Montpellier
or S ete (within the MARBEC laboratory) for visiting
B. Ernande or O. Maury, and participating to Inter-
national Conferences. Within DECOD, the successful
candidate will be in close interaction with world recog-
nized researchers in aquatic ecology, and conservation,sheries sciences and ecosystemic modelling. Duration
and salary: The successful applicant will be hired

SmithC MicroEukGenomes
Postdoctoral Positions: Bioinformatic and single-cell
'omics approaches for studying genome evolution in mi-
crobial eukaryotes
The Department of Biological Sciences at Smith College
invites applications for two benets eligible postdoctoral
positions, focusing on genome evolution in microeukary-
otes (aka protists), to begin on or after August 1, 2022.
The bulk of the work will focus on bioinformatic anal-
yses of data generated in the lab from foraminifera
and ciliates. The initial appointment is for one year,
with the possibility of extending for additional years.
The position will be housed in Professor Laura Katz's
laboratory in the Department of Biological Sciences
(https://www.science.smith.edu/katzlab/)
The aims of this project include characterizing genome
architecture in poorly-studied clades and reconstructing
the evolutionary history of both genes and species (i.e.
species delimitation).
Research in the Katz lab aims to elucidate principles of
the evolution in eukaryotes through analyses of micro-
bial groups, and to assess how these principles apply (or
fail to apply) to other organisms. Currently we focus
on three interrelated areas: (1) characterizing evolu-
tionary relationships among eukaryotes using single-cell
'omics' and phylogenomics; (2) exploring the evolution
of germline vs somatic genomes; and (3) describing
the phylogeography and biodiversity of protists in local
environments (bogs, fens, coastal habitats).
Minimum qualications include a PhD in a relevant
eld, knowledge of the diversity of eukaryotic microor-
ganisms, and familiarity with basic bioinformatic tools.
The ideal candidate will: 1) be a productive researcher
with interests in both biodiversity and phylogenomics
of microorganisms; 2) have experience identifying and
isolating diverse protists; 3) have knowledge of bioin-
formatic and/or phylogenetic tools; 3) have excellent
communication and interpersonal skills; and 4) be inter-
ested in collaborating with graduate and undergraduate
students in the laboratory.

evolutionary-biology-and-forensics-1.783359). Currently,
we are focusing on two projects, based on two unique
and exciting datasets, for which we seek a postdoctoral
researcher:(i) We are studying the genomic eects of the
creation of the modern dog breeds. By analysis of DNA
from 100-year-old dog skins, obtained from traditional
clothes from northern Sweden, we can compare the ge-
nomics of the original non-breed population 100 years
ago with that of the modern Lapphund and Elkhound
breeds. Hereby, we obtain exact measurements of the
genetic dierence between the historical and the modern
populations, concerning, e.g., amount of genetic diver-
sity, level of inbreeding, heterozygosity and frequency of
deleterious alleles. Based on this, we can draw conclu-
sions about how the breeding process has aected the
genetic status of the modern dog breeds. (ii) We are
studying the rst origin of the domestic dog. Together
with collaborators, we have access to a unique collection
of DNA from modern dog populations from across the
world. Based on this, we aim to analyze nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes, to describe phylogeny, demogra-
phy and phylogenomics among dogs worldwide, in order
to describe the origins, evolution and early history ofthe domestic dog.
TRAINING AND SCHILLS REQUIRED: A doctoral
degree is required. The candidate should have a strong
background in population genomics and bioinformatics.
WORK ENVIRONMENT: The postdoctoral researcher
will work in a research group with a long record of
genomic, phylogenetic and population genetic studies
of domestic dogs (https://www.kth.se/gte/research/-
evolutionary-biology-and-forensics-1.783359). KTH
Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm is one of
Europe's leading technical and engineering universities.
The department is localized at Science for Life Labo-
ratory (Scilifelab), which is northern Europe's largest
infrastructure within biological science.
THE POSITION: The position is a scholarship, giv-
ing a tax free scholarship of 30,000 Euro/year (2,500
Euro/month, tax free).
HOW TO APPLY: Please direct applications and/or
questions to Peter Savolainen (savo@kth.se). The fol-

ConservationGenomics
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is an internationally networked aquatic
research institute within the ETH Domain (Swiss Fed-
eral Institutes of Technology). Eawag conducts research,
education and expert consulting to achieve the dual goals
of meeting direct human needs for water and maintain-
ing the function and integrity of aquatic ecosystems.
Eawag's Departments of Fish Ecology & Evolution and
Aquatic Ecology have an opening for a Postdoc in Con-
servation Genomics of Aquatic Ecosystems
The position, based in the groups of Philine Feulner
and Alexandra Anh-Thu Weber, is funded for 2 years
within the project \Establishing a framework for con-
servation genomics of freshwater biodiversity". The
project, funded by Eawag, also includes a collaboration
with Jakob Brodersen (Eawag, River Fish Ecology) and
Damien Bouard (Eawag, Aquatic Physics). Both the
Fish Genomics group of Philine Feulner and the Adap-
tation & Conservation Genomics group of Alexandra
Anh-Thu Weber focus on research questions regarding:
i) the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation, ii) the
inuences of selection, drift, mutation, and recombi-
nation on genome evolution, and iii) the development
and implementation of genomic tools for conservation
purposes.
Background: Freshwater biodiversity is threatened by
physical alterations of aquatic habitats for anthro-
pogenic use, pollution, and exploitation of species. Con-
servation genomics is an innovative approach allowing
to: i) monitor biodiversity and genetic diversity at an
unprecedented resolution; ii) identify highly endangered
populations, and iii) protect and possibly rescue en-
dangered populations. However, established methods
and programs are currently limited but are important
to implement adequate monitoring and conservation
strategies.
The project focuses on establishing a framework for
conservation genomics of freshwater biodiversity using
two case studies: the European grayling Thymallus thy-
mallus and the freshwater mussel Anodonta anatina.
The project aims at developing a conservation genomics
framework that goes beyond monitoring and will link
genomic diversity with physical water parameters, an-August 1, 2022 EvolDir 83
thropogenic landscape use, and restoration eorts. This
project aims to establish the feasibility and principles
of genomic monitoring for Swiss aquatic habitats, and
to provide solutions for an innovative development of
biodiversity monitoring and conservation.
The candidate is expected to: i) generate and analyze
next generation whole-genome population data, ii) de-
velop reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for conserva-
tion genomics, and iii) interpret and publish the results
through peer-reviewed articles and translational mate-
rial dedicated to practitioners and stakeholders. There
will opportunities to gain eld experience in Switzerland,
to develop their own research interests, and to assist
in the supervision of Bachelors and Master students.
Ideally, the candidate has a profound interest in Bioin-
formatics, Evolutionary Genomics and Conservation
Biology, and has recently earned a PhD in a relevant
eld of evolutionary biology or bioinformatics. We par-
ticularly value interest to interact with practitioners
and stakeholders in Switzerland. Excellent communica-
tion skills in English and ability to work in a team are
essential.
The position is situated in the Department of Fish Ecol-
ogy & Evolution. The Department is part of Eawag's
Center for Ecology, Evolution & Biogeochemistry
(CEEB), which is located on the shore of Lake Lucerne
and is a strong nucleus of Eawag research groups aimed
at integrating evolutionary biology, community ecology,
and ecosystem science. The postdoc will interact with a
diverse range of researchers studying community ecology,
evolutionary biology, ecological genetics, ecosystem
science, and applied environmental science. The Fish
Genomics group is also aliated to the Institute of
Ecology and Evolution of the University of Bern, and
the successful candidate will have a unique opportunity
to take advantage of both these excellent academic
environments. More information about ongoing projects

Research Career Development Fellowships in the Depart-
ment of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, UCL:
Expression of Interest for 2022
The Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and
Environment, (GEE) at University College London
(UCL) invites Expressions of Interest from Early Career
Researchers (ECRs) who wish to be sponsored for ex-
ternal fellowships to establish an independent research
group.
Successful candidates will be of the highest calibre, able
to demonstrate an exceptional track record in relation
to their career stage, and have the potential to sub-
mit competitive fellowship applications. GEE oers a
world-class, interactive and support research environ-
ment within the Division of Biosciences at UCL. We are
strongly committed to recruiting and supporting the
most promising ECRs who choose to secure a Group
Leader Fellowship as their route to becoming a Principal
Investigator. This policy applies to senior fellowships
such as Wellcome Trust Henry Dale, MRC CDA, BB-SRC David Phillips, NERC IRF, Royal Society URF,
CRUK, ERC Starting Grants and equivalent fellowships.
We provide support to ensure that fellows can success-
fully establish their own research group, have oppor-
tunities to gain teaching skills and play a full role in
the running of the department. Our commitment starts
with academic and administrative support at the appli-
cation and interview stages and continues throughout
the tenure of the fellowship, with regular career develop-
ment and mentoring programmes. We expect fellows to
develop into strong candidates for Principal Investigator
positions in the department or elsewhere. In line with
this ethos, a large proportion of our past departmental
fellows have progressed to permanent positions in GEE.
Areas of Research Interest:
GEE is organised into six Centres, with cross-cutting
research interests, and close links with other organisa-
tions, including the Francis Crick Institute, the Natural
History Museum, and The Zoological Society of London.
We especially welcome expressions of interest from ECRs
with a strong track record in the following areas:
Institute of Healthy Aging: Ageing, age-related disease;
interventions improving late-life health in model sys-
tems (e.g. cellular senescence); applying computational
approaches to ageing and late-life disease (AI, big data,
medical genomics).
Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research: Evo-
lution in response to environmental change; theoretical
ecology; community or behavioural ecology (especially
in plants, insects, fungi or microbes); biodiversity and
its contributions to human health and well-being. Cen-
tre for Life's Origins and Evolution: Origins and early
diversication of the animals; comparative genomics;
evolution of cell types; invertebrate palaeontology, plant
and fungal evolutionary genomics.
UCL Centre for Computational Biology: Big data and
computation; computational genomics; computational
phylogenomics.
UCL Genetics Institute: Computational approaches to
biology or medicine; computational tool development
and applying them to genomic data; high-throughput
bioinformatics, statistical genetics; metagenomics.
UCL East Nature Smart Centre: Cross-disciplinary so-
lutions hub bringing together expertise from ecology,
computer science, public health, built environment and
social science to gather evidence on how we can best
manage our natural resources for a sustainable and re-
silient future.
We strongly encourage expressions of interest from
women, disabled candidates, and those from an eth-88 EvolDir August 1, 2022
nic minority from the UK and internationally as part
of our ongoing commitment to equality, diversity, and
inclusion.

UdePau ComputationalBiology
Dear all,
We are recruiting one collaborator in Microbial Ecology
with expertise in Bioinformatics and/or Computational
Biology at the Universit e de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour.
The fellowship will have the duration of 12 months.
Topic:
Metallophores in microbial communities: distribution,
diversity, importance in microbial assemblages and
ecosystem functioning
Scientic context:
In a natural environment, at pH where most life exists,
microbial growth can be limited by the availability of
metals. This limitation in the environment can have
signicant consequences on ecosystem functioning. To
ensure their survival and their development, microor-
ganisms have developed strategies for the recovery and
absorption of metals from the surrounding environment.
The capture of metal is ensured by the synthesis of
siderophores (iron) or more generically metallophores.
The biosynthetic potential of metallophores does not
appear to be equally distributed among organisms, en-
vironments or microbial life cycles, but rather is en-
riched within a number of prolic clades. One eld
of investigation aims at seeking for new metallophorebiosynthetic genes to enlarge our view of their diversity
in the microbial world and investigate these data in an
eco-evolutionary perspective.
Scientic environment:
The post-doctoral fellow will work at the IPREM In-
stitute (https://iprem.univ-pau.fr/fr/index.html) under
the supervision of Pr. B. Lauga and Pr R. Duran, and in
collaboration with M. Medema ( bioinformatics group)
at the U. Wageningen.
He will bring all the bioinformatics expertise required
for a ne investigation of metagenomic and metatran-
scriptomic data generated on eld collected, microcosm
generated samples and worldwide databases in order
to i) establish an inventory of metallophore biosyn-
thetic gene clusters (BGC), in microbial genomes and
metagenomes from diverse environments, ii) infer their
role in microbial assemblages by linking them to known
metallophores and natural products, iii) conduct meta-
analysis on the distribution of BGC across worldwide
habitats in order to highlight any specic distribution
and reveal if hot spots of genetic diversity exist for
metallophore BGC.
Our ultimate goals are i) to better understand the
metabolic interactions occurring within complex multi-
species microbial assemblages, ii) to evaluate, at the
ecosystem level, how metallophores contribute to com-
munity assembly, functioning, and beyond, to ecosys-
tems functioning. In parallel, teaching duties (64h) will
accompany the research tasks.
Situation:
The Universit e de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour campus
is located in the charming city of Pau in southwestern
France in a region bordering Spain. It benets from
exceptional resources due to its geographical location,
close to the Pyrenees (1h drive) and the Atlantic coast
(1h drive), with numerous air links from the airport and
trains to Paris.
The IPREM is a Joint Research Unit CNRS / UPPA
(UMR 5254) with 120 permanent sta and 140 PhD and
Post-docs.
Requirements:
We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral research
scientist with expertise in the analysis of (meta )ge-
nomics/(meta )transcriptomics data to work at IPREM.
The ideal candidates should have a PhD in the elds
of Bioinformatics or Computational Biology and mi-
crobial ecology, with research experience in NGS data
analysis. A good background in microbial evolution and
biostatistics would be appreciated.

We are seeking a motivated Postdoctoral/Project
Researcher to work in our project \Towards molecular-
level understanding of fertilization and sexual selection"
(funded by the Academy of Finland, more information
from research: https://gamcomgroup.wordpress.com).
As our new^ a eresearcher,^ a eyou will be work-
ing^ aein^ aethe Department of Environmental and
Biological Sciences of^ a eFaculty of Science and
Forestry.^ a eThe^ aeposition is located in Joensuu and/or
Kuopio campus, Finland.^ a e
The Postdoctoral/Project Researcher will participate in
experimental research that aims to clarify the mecha-
nisms of cryptic female choice in humans. Depending
on the expertise of the researcher your^ a emain responsi-
bilities^ a ecan include e.g.:
* Clarifying molecular (RNA, DNA, or protein) level
mechanisms of cryptic female choice, * Conducting
sperm chemotaxis/selection (cryptic female choice) as-
says, * Phenotypic measurements (e.g. motility, mor-
phology and DNA integrity) of ^ a' and ^ a-selected' sperm,
or * Identication of candidate genes for male female
reproductive incompatibility and cryptic female choice
from genomic databases.
Fertilization is one of the most complex and enigmatic
biological processes, which severely hinders our under-standing about reproduction, evolution and beginning of
life. It has traditionally been assumed that fertilization
is a completely unbiased process, leading to random
fusion of gametes. Against this assumption, our recent
ndings have indicated that gametes often combine non-
randomly, which bias fertilization towards particular
(compatible) reproductive partners (see e.g. https:/-
/doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.0836 and https://doi.org/-
10.1098/rspb.2020.1682). However, the molecular-level
mechanisms of such gamete-level sexual selection have
remained unclear. The primary aim of our research is to
clarify these mechanisms in humans and this way also
gain better understanding of the mechanistic basis of
fertilization and infertility (see https://doi.org/10.1093/-
humrep/deab221).

UGlasgow
ReproductiveModeEvoDevo
We have a research opportunity at the University of
Glasgow in the research team of Kathryn Elmer in col-
laboration with Maureen Bain and project partner Jean
Clobert (CNRS SETE in Moulis, France).
We are seeking a motivated, creative, and enthusiastic
postdoctoral researcher for a project on the genetic basis
of oviparous and viviparous reproductive modes, funded
by NERC. The project will advance reproductive biol-
ogy by using rigorous experimental tests and functional
evolutionary genomics to reveal the molecular basis of
reproductive mode evolution and scrutinise a putative
reversal. This will be accomplished using the powerfulnatural framework of a European species (the common
lizard) that has both reproductive modes extant. The
research aims to identify gene expression and describe
ultrastructural features of reproductive tissue; deter-
mine the genetic basis of gene expression regulation;
and reconstruct the genome-wide evolutionary history
across all extant lineages. The project involves extended
periods of research stay in Moulis, France. Related side-
projects are also possible and supported.
A strong track record of evolutionary and/or develop-
mental biology and/or genetic research is necessary,
and on vertebrates (especially squamates) is a benet.
Animal husbandry experience would be very valuable;
eldwork skills would be advantageous. Ability to work
well both independently and in a team are a must.
The position is until 31 Aug 2024 and then a further
extension ( ~5-14 months) is anticipated. Start date is
exible; preferably around 1 Nov and not later than
Jan 2023. The position is open at grade 6 (early post-
doc; research assistant) or grade 7 (experienced postdoc;
research associate).
International applicants will be eligible for a UK work
visa supported by the University of Glasgow. We strive
to be a supportive environment and welcome a diversity
of applicants!
The University of Glasgow ranks in the world's top 100
universities, recently won the Top University award from
the Times Higher Education, and is strongly committed
to supporting postdoc career progression. The city of
Glasgow is lively and cultural, and sits on the doorstep
of the great outdoors of the Scottish Highlands, islands,

27bc1b12f1f814c9eef0203b238c3cb6c5020835 In
my group we are studying the genetic basis for variation
in immunocompetence and disease susceptibility in
vertebrates, with a particular focus on the adaptive
immune system and specically the process of antigen
presentation (MHC) and recognition (TCRs). We
usually take an evolutionary perspective and aim to
understand the factors and mechanisms that maintain
genetic diversity in this context, but are also interested
in the consequences of this diversity for the individual's
health and have several ongoing collaborations with
clinical groups on specic complex diseases. This
position will particularly strengthen our work on the
evolutionary side, being responsible for driving our work
on the genetics of adaptive immunity in sticklebacks
forward. We see the stickleback as a fantastic model
species for studying the adaptive immune system
in the place where it originally evolved, i.e. in the
organism's natural environment. At the same time the
stickleback allows us to do fully controlled experiments
in the lab (we have a newly equipped sh facility),
including controlled exposure experiments and targeted
breeding. Previous work from us and others provides
an excellent picture of the genetic organization of
the MHC in the stickleback, on which we will build.
More importantly, we have recently established a
TCR sequencing protocol for sticklebacks and are now
exploring the T cell repertoire diversity and dynamics inresponse to dierent conditions and its interaction with
MHC diversity. This position (and the environment we
provide) thus holds great promise for exciting research
projects into the evolution of antigen recognition
and adaptive immunity in a naturally diverse species
(nothing against laboratory mice, but they are just not
the real thing!).
The position requires wet lab experience and a minor
level of eld work anity, but also computer-based anal-
yses and NGS data crunching. So some experience with
NGS data analysis will be advantageous. For more spe-
cic requirements and duties, including a minor level of
teaching, please see the advert above.
Our newly renovated labs and oces in the Institute for
Animal Cell and Systems Biology at the University of
Hamburg are situated in the middle of Hamburg, the
second largest city in Germany. The institute is neigh-
boring the main university campus with its bustling
student life and cafes, and easy to reach by bike or any
public transport (and car, if you must).

Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,
MO, USA
Job Description A PhD level position is available ASAP
in the Mitreva Lab ( mitrevalab.wustl.edu ) at the Divi-
sion of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine and
McDonnell Genome Institute and Washington Univer-
sity School of Medicine. The candidate will be part of
an established and successful research group focused on
integrating ^ a-omics' approaches aimed at understand-
ing helminth infections at a systems biology level. The
position requires working collaboratively with a team of
experimental and computational biologists focused on
integrating multidimensional biological data to better
understand pathogen evolution, ecology, biology, host-
pathogen interaction, epidemiology, transmission, etc.
Washington University School of Medicine (
medicine.wustl.edu ) is one of the two main campuses
of Washington University in St. Louis
Mitreva Lab is in the McDonnell Genome Institute (
genome.wustl.edu/ ) which has been at the forefront of
genome research since its inception in 1993. We are a
world-leader in genomics research as it applies to the
study of model organisms and human biology, infections,
genetic diseases, and the  of personalized medicine. Weprovide a value-added biologically and clinically relevant
sequence analysis, and foster public understanding of
science through various educational and outreach eorts.
The postdoctoral fellow will work on NIH-funded
projects focused on parasitic vector-borne disease caused
by Onchocerca volvulus and the liver uke Fasciola hep-
atica. Better understanding of how the genomes of these
parasites evolve can enables us to discover how they re-
sist standard drugs. That knowledge then could result
in identication of genetic markers that predict whether
a drug will fail to eectively treat infected individuals,
thus guiding the design of new treatments. Onchocercia-
sis (river blindness) is primarily endemic in sub-Saharan
Africa, with an estimated 197 million people at risk of
infection, and Fascioliasis (liver uke) has been reported
in 81 countries worldwide and infects between 2.5-17
million people. The project aims at identifying genetic
markers and mechanisms of anthelmintic resistance to
facilitate production of tools to tackle post-treatment re-
crudescence of infection, parasites emergence and spread.
The candidate will be responsible for leading and carry-
ing out this innovative project that involve population
and functional genomics studies of these important para-
sites, and will have opportunities to travel and to present
at national and international conferences.

GeneralisedAdditiveModelsInR
Oct10-14
Dear all,
registration is now open for the 2nd edition of
the Generalised Additive Models in R course:https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
gams-in-r/ Dates: online, October, 10th-14th
The course is aimed at graduate students and researchers
with some statistical knowledge; ideally you'll know
something about generalized linear models, likelihood,
and AIC. However we'll recap what GLMs are so if
you're a little rusty or not everything mentioned in the
GLM course makes sense, we have you covered. From
running the course previously, knowing the dierence
between \xed" and \random" eects, and what the
terms \random intercepts" and \random slopes" are,
will be helpful for the Hierarchical GAM topic, but we
don't expect you to be an expert in mixed eects or
hierarchical models to take this course. Participants
should be familiar with RStudio and have some uency
in programming R code, including being able to import,
manipulate (e.g. modify variables) and visualise data.
There will be a mix of lectures, in-class discussion, and
hands-on practical exercises along the course.
After completing the course, attendees will be in the
condition to:
1. Understand how GAMs work from a practical view
point to learn relationships between covariates and re-
sponse from the data 2. Be able to t GAMs in R using
the mgcv and brms packages 3. Know the dierences
between the types of splines and when to use them in
your models 4. Know how to visualise tted GAMs and
to check the assumptions of the model

MultivariateDataAnalysisWithR
Nov21-25
Dear all,
registration is now open for the online Physalia course
\Multivariate data analysis with R and vegan" in Novem-
ber (21st-25th).
Course website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/vegan/ In this course, we will focus
on the use of ordination methods and on the use of
restricted permutations to test a range of experimental
designs. We will focus in particular on when and how
to use multivariate methods including unconstrained
and constrained ordination (CCA, RDA, Constrained
PCoA), as well as between-group tests such as PER-
MANOVA. We will cover concepts such as design- and
model-based permutations and the exchangeability of
samples in tests. We will also discuss the use of vegan
to go beyond simply tting a constrained ordination
model, to diagnostics, plotting, etc.
This course is suitable for PhD students (including
senior thesis-based masters students) and researchers
working with multivariate data sets in biology (inter
alia ecology, animal science agriculture, microbial ecol-
ogy/microbiology), with limited statistical knowledge
but a willingness to learn more.

Dear all,
there are still a few seats available for our In-
troduction to Statistics in R with the tidyverse:108 EvolDir August 1, 2022
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course13/ )
Dates: Online, September 19th-22nd
After a short introduction on R and its principles, the
focus will be on questions that could be addressed us-
ing common statistical analyses, both for descriptive
statistics and for statistical inference.
The course is aimed at people interested in widening
their analytical toolbox. The course is structured in a
way that even an inexperienced and na >1
2ve attendee
could take advantage of the possibilities oered by the
inclusion of statistical analyses using R. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using R
as a freely available software and online resources. The
course is devoted to beginners with no prior knowledge
of statistics, programming, and R language, but with
a keen interest in using R as a platform for statistical
analyses. All scripts will be carefully explained to allow
all attendees understanding the rationale and usage of
the statistical approaches.

Online TropicConservationGenetics
Sep12-23
We are happy to announce Conservation Genetics in the
Tropics 2022, which will be all online this year.
Many conservation genetics tools have been developed
for use in temperate other high latitude habitats, and so
not all of these tools translate to the tropics. Tropical
habitats share some features which complicate the ap-plication of some conservation genetics tools which are
heavily relied upon in higher latitudes, and also share
some basic questions and problems that are less of an
issue in higher latitudes or other, better studies and/ or
less diverse habitats.
This course will discuss practical issues, genetic and
genomic theory, tools and analyses as applied to issues
relevant to conservation in the tropics. Some basic
questions of conservation importance include describ-
ing species diversity, determining species distributions,
characterizing the basic biology of species, and under-
standing demographic history and population size and
structure. Underlying biogeographic histories that have
shaped communities, and the biotic interactions within
those communities are also of fundamental importance.
There are online computer practicals in parallel with
the lectures, seminars and discussions.
This course is designed with students and practitioners
of Conservation Biology or Conservation Genetics in the
tropical regions of America, Africa and Asia in mind.
This course will take place September 12 - 23 entirely on-
line, hosted by the Estaci >1
2n Biol >1
2gica de Do >1
2ana
(www.ebd.csic.es). In order to best accommodate people
across many time zones, this course will consist of a
combination of pre-recorded lectures and seminars, and
synchronous discussions and practicals. The course will
be held in English.

September 2022
This 5-day course will cover R concepts, methods, and
tools that can be used to analyze community ecology
data. The course will review data processing techniques
relevant to multivariate data sets. We will cover di-
versity indices, distance measures and distance-based
multivariate methods, clustering, classication and ordi-
nation techniques using the R package VEGAN. We will
use real-world empirical data sets to motivate analyses,
such as describing patterns along gradients of environ-
mental or anthropogenic disturbances, quantifying the
eects of continuous and discrete predictors. We will
emphasise visualisation and reproducible workows as
well as good programming practices. The modules will
consist of introductory lectures, guided computer cod-
ing, and participant exercises. The course is intended
for intermediate users of R who are interested in com-
munity ecology, particularly in the areas of terrestrial
and wetland ecology, microbial ecology, and natural re-
source management. You are strongly encouraged to use
your own data sets (they should be clean and already
structured, see the document: \recommendation if you
participate with your data".

dataset in research, natural resource management or
conservation context. This course is not geared toward
any particular taxonomic group or ecological system.We will cover diversity indices, distance measures and
multivariate distance-based methods, clustering, classi-
cation, and ordination techniques. We will focus on
the concept of the methods and their implementation
on R using dierent R packages. We will use real-world
examples to implement analyses, such as describing pat-
terns along gradients of environmental or anthropogenic
disturbances, quantifying the eects of continuous and
discrete predictors, data mining. The course will consist
of lectures, work on R code scripts, and exercises for
participants.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
