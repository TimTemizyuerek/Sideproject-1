Dear colleagues:
We would like to invite you to participate in Mini-
Symposium 6, “Ecological and evolutionary genomics
of coral reef organisms”, being held at the 11th ICRS
in Fort Lauderdale, July 7th-11th 2008.
The 11th International Coral Reef Symposium science
program will address scientiﬁc questions within the
framework of a series of Mini- Symposia developed
to address problems and issues on contemporary coral
reefs that will assist management to sustain future reefs.
The central theme for the 11th ICRS is “REEFS FOR
THE FUTURE”. The Symposium goals are to provide
a scientiﬁc basis for coral reef ecosystem management
by articulating the state of the science with respect
to current and emerging stressors; improve the under-
standing of reef condition, function, and productivity;
and grow the ﬁelds of coral reef ecosystem science, con-
servation, and multidisciplinary research by facilitating
the exchange of ideas.
We have invited four distinguished speakers to pro-
vide a broad perspective on the main questions posed
by the Mini-Symposium. The central topics of Mini-
Symposium 6 and the invited speakers are as follows:
1) What is the role of genome science in coral reef ecol-
ogy and evolution, examples from symbiosis, bleaching,
disease, microbial communities and phylogenomics?November 1, 2007 EvolDir 5
Sandie Degnan, University of Queensland 2) What ge-
nomic approaches are already available for coral reef
science? Forest Rohwer, San Diego State University
3) What are the challenges for integrating global cli-
mate data with genomic data? Ove Huegh-Guldbergh,
University of Queensland 4) Do genomic approaches
hold promise for developing environmental monitoring?
Cheryl Woodley, NOAA
We welcome abstract submissions on these topics as
well as all aspects of “Ecological and evolutionary ge-
nomics of coral reef organisms”. Submissions that ad-
dress these questions are encouraged but not manda-
tory. If you have an alternative question or questions
you are addressing, please so note. All submissions ad-
dressing ecological and evolutionary genomics of coral
reef organisms are encouraged to be submitted for con-
sideration.
When submitting your abstracts, please use the session
code: Mini- Symposium 6. The deadline for abstract
submission is 15 November 2007.

NESCent Hackathon on Comparative Methods in R
Call for Participation and Input
The R statistical analysis package has emerged as a
popular platform for implementation of powerful com-
parative phylogenetic methods to understand the evo-
lution of organismal traits. The National Evolutionary
Synthesis Center (NESCent) is organizing a hackathon
focused on the integration of comparative phylogenetic
methods within R. The event will take place on Dec 10-
14, 2007, at NESCent in Durham, North Carolina. We
are broadly soliciting applications for participation as

/hackathon.nescent.org/R Hackathon 1. A hackathon
is an event at which a group of programmers who oth-
erwise do not have the opportunity to interact on a rou-
tine basis meet to collaboratively develop working code
that is of utility to the community as a whole. This
event will bring together diﬀerent groups of developers
and users of comparative methods to work towards a
common set of objectives centering on common chal-
lenges of data exchange, interoperability, and usability.November 1, 2007 EvolDir 7
CALL FOR INPUT We are soliciting input from the
community at large regarding the priorities and objec-
tives of the hackathon. If you are a user of compar-
ative phylogenetic software and have any ideas that
you would like the community of developers to be
aware of, please submit your input directly through the
hackathon wiki ( http://hackathon.nescent.org; click on
’Forum’) or by email to hackathon2@nescent.org.
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION We invite all individu-
als interested in attending to respond by email to the
questions below. We are speciﬁcally encouraging appli-
cations from: * Members of underrepresented groups,
speciﬁcally women and members of minorities. * Those
with skills and interests in documentation or visual-
ization, as both are currently underrepresented among
the initial set of attendees * Biologists familiar with
comparative phylogenetic methods who are interested
in working face-to-face with developers to help prior-
itize needs, document and test the code being devel-
oped, provide feedback regarding usability, and ensure
the community value of the code being written at the
event. * Graduate students and postdocs.
Please read the detailed description on the website
(http://hackathon.nescent.org/R Hackathon 1) prior
to applying. Email your responses and, if possible, a
CV to hackathon2@nescent.org by October 14.
1. Please indicate if you would be available for all or
only for part of the Dec 10-14 time period.
2. All code produced at the event is to be made avail-
able immediately under an OSI-approved open-source
license (speciﬁcally, the GPL for any code in R). Please
indicate whether this would pose any diﬃculty for your
participation.
3. Brieﬂy describe your qualiﬁcations (e.g. your famil-
iarity with comparative phylogenetic methods and/or
R programming).
4. Please state what you would most like to accom-
plish at the hackathon. If you would not be writing
software at the event, please state how you would like
to contribute and how you would expect to beneﬁt.
5. Please indicate if you are a member of an under-
represented group (including women, persons with dis-
abilities, and any of the following minorities: African
American, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska Native,
Native Hawaiian, and Paciﬁc Islander).
Please be aware that the funds, as well as the space,
for this event are limited, and the organizers need to
balance the skills of the attendees, so not all qualiﬁed
applicants can be guaranteed acceptance.

nity for budding systematists to discuss their research
in front of their peers within a supportive environment.
Supervisors and other established systematists are also
encouraged to attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE. Please let us know is you wish
to attend. Send applications by e-mail to Peter Ol-
son (P.Olson@nhm.ac.uk), supplying your name, con-
tact address and stating whether or not you wish to give
an oral or poster presentation. Space will be allocated
subject to availability and for a balanced programme of
animal, plant, algal, molecular and other research.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than 16th November 2007. The body text should
not exceed 150 words in length. If the presentation

DISPERSAL conference December 6-7, 2007 Museum
National d?Histoire Naturelle, department for Ecology
& Biodiversity Managing Paris, France Abstract dead-
line - November 12, 2007
In September 2005, Silke Hein, Thomas Hovestadt and
Hans Van Dyck brought together about 20 researchers
within the ﬁeld of dispersal ecology and evolution for
an informal discussion meeting in the Fabrikschleichach
ﬁeldstation (W¨ urzburg University). The format of this
workshop meeting and the enthusiastic participation of
both empiricists and modelers made this a really suc-
cessful and useful event. Some of the participants met
again during other meetings (BES meeting at Oxford,
2006 and the Biobutterﬂy congress at Rome, 2007) Yet
there is a clear demand for a second edition of this dis-
persal workshop. It will be held at the Ecology lab of
the Museum National d?Histoire Naturelle in Brunoy,
near Paris, at the beginning of December 2007. The at-
tendees of this closed meeting, which needs to be more
restricted in the number of participants, wish to open
their discussion to a wider audience in a 2-days con-
ference that will be organized back-to-back with the
workshop, in Paris. The organizers of this event are
pleased to open the registration for this conference.
Program: 2 full days (8.30 ? 18.30)

Framework:
The “environment” of parasites is made of many dif-
ferent types of factors. First, the genotype of the host
itself produces the background of the parasite’s devel-
opment. Moreover, the interactions between host and
parasite genotypes (i.e. GxG interactions) can result
in the shared control of their traits. Finally, as for any
type of organism, other biotic and abiotic factors, oc-
curring inside and outside the host, can aﬀect the trans-
lation of genotypic variations into phenotypes. Such
sensu stricto environmental factors add another layer
of complexity to the determinism of phenotypes as they
can aﬀect the interactions between host and parasite
genotypes leading to GxGxE interactions. The num-
ber of “statistically signiﬁcant” environmental factors
(e.g. temperature, within host competitors, GxG inter-
actions) never stops growing. But how important they
are remains obscure. Planning:
The presentations will be followed by two general dis-
cussions on:
Morning: The coevolutionary process and what vari-
ability studies tell us of evolution in dynamic environ-
ments Afternoon: Integrating environmental ﬂuctua-
tions into mathematical models of host and parasite
evolution.

CALL FOR PAPERS: Artiﬁcial Life XI
The Eleventh International Conference on the Simula-
tion and Synthesis of Living Systems 5th - 8th August
2008, Winchester, UK www.alifexi.org Artiﬁcial life in-
vestigates the fundamental properties of living systems
through simulating and synthesizing biological entities
and processes in artiﬁcial media. Summer 2008 will see
the international ALife conference hosted by the Uni-
versity of Southampton, UK, bringing the meeting to
Europe for the ﬁrst time in its 21-year history. Over the
last two decades, some of the highly speculative ideas
that were discussed at the ﬁeld’s inception have ma-
tured to the extent that new conferences and journals
devoted to them are being established:
synthesising artiﬁcial cells, simulating massive biologi-
cal networks, exploiting biological substrates for com-
putation and control, and deploying bio-inspired engi-
neering are all now cutting-edge practice.
The ALife XI conference provides an opportunity for
those working across these topics to get together and
exchange ideas and results.
To this end, the conference will present a selection of
the best current work in the ﬁeld, highlight new direc-
tions for investigation, and present high-proﬁle keynote
speakers.
Papers are welcome in all areas of the ﬁeld, including:
Synthesis and origin of life, self-organization Self-
replication, artiﬁcial chemistries Evolution and adap-
tation, evolutionary dynamics Evolutionary games, co-
evolution Development, diﬀerentiation, and regula-
tion Generative representations Synthetic biology Self-
organizing technology, self-* computing Computational
ecosystems Unconventional and biologically inspired
computing Bio-inspired robots and embodied cogni-
tion Autonomous agents, evolutionary robotics Col-
lective behavior, communication, cooperation Artiﬁcial
consciousness; the relationship between life and mindPhilosophical, ethical, and cultural implications Math-
ematical and philosophical foundations of ALife New
and creative syntheses
All authors are encouraged to explain how their work
sheds light on the fundamental properties of living sys-
tems and makes progress on the important open ques-
tions identiﬁed at previous meetings.
The conference will be held in Winchester, a beautiful
historic city in southern England known for its 11th-
century cathedral and 12th-century castle. Winchester
is set in forested countryside about an hour southwest
of London and Heathrow airport, and a few miles from
the host institution, the University of Southampton.
PAPER/ABSTRACT FORMAT
There are two options for submission: either full pa-
per format or abstract format. Full papers have an 8
page maximum length, while abstracts are limited to
500 words. Every submission will be subject to full
peer review. All accepted submissions will be allocated
a 30-minute oral presentation slot with no distinction
being made between the two submission formats. All
formatting guidelines (including word and latex style
ﬁles) and submission instructions will be available on
the conference submission webpage:
http://www.alifexi.org/submissions/ .
PUBLICATION
Both full-paper and abstract submissions will be pub-
lished by MIT Press in a single online proceedings vol-
ume. The best 15-20 papers will have the opportunity
to be published in special issues of the journal Artiﬁcial
Life.

PhD fellowship - Evolutionary Genetics of Invasive
Jointed Goatgrass
Funding is available for a PhD student to study jointed
Goatgrass at Colorado State University. This PhD fel-
lowship is funded as part of a collaboration between
evolutionary biologists and agricultural scientists to un-
derstand the impact of gene ﬂow from wheat to its close
relative, jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica). This
project involves using a variety of molecular approaches
to quantify gene ﬂow, ranging from cytogenetics to se-
quence evolution. The student will receive formal train-
ing in genetics and evolution, as the research will also
examine the population history of the species includ-
ing invasive populations in Colorado, and the evolution
of traits responsible for the agricultural impact of this
weed. We are looking for a highly motivated individual
with a B.S. or Masters degree and with the demon-
strated ability to carry out outstanding research. The
successful candidate must have a strong background
evolutionary biology and genetics, and the desire to
answer applied questions in agriculture and weed sci-
ence. We also emphasize the ability to interact and
work collaboratively with others, as the student will
work closely with several Professors on the project. In
addition to the molecular assays, the project as a whole
involves substantial quantitative genetic and ecological
genetic experiments. While no experience in this area
is required, the candidate will receive graduate training
in quantitative genetics and the evolution of complex
traits.The position is available starting Fall 2008. Salary and
beneﬁts are competitive, and Colorado State is an ex-
cellent academic environment for a PhD in plant ge-
nomics, weed science, plant evolutionary biology and
the impacts of invasive species.
If you are interested in this PhD fellowship, please send
a letter of interest and a C.V., as a pdf via e-mail to

search groups of the ETH-domain collaborate to de-
velop concepts, collect data and conduct experiments
to derive predictive models of biodiversity change in
response to environmental, ecological and evolutionary
processes aﬀecting alpine habitats.
We are looking for a highly motivated student with a
strong interest in evolutionary ecology. The ideal can-
didate has a demonstrated ability to design and carryout experiments but candidates with a background in
population genetics/molecular ecology and a keen inter-
est in experimental work are also encouraged to apply.
Some experience with ﬁeldwork is important and the
candidate should be able to work independently and as
part of a team. A diploma or M.Sc. (or equivalent)
degree in biology is mandatory. Working language of
the lab is English.
The Department of Aquatic Ecology is located in

FungalSpeciesHybridization
Doctoral position at Institute of Integrative Biology,
ETH Z¨ urich
In the group Plant Ecological Genetics of the Institute
Integrative Biology, ETH Z¨ urich, is a doctoral position
available starting January 1, 2008.
Project title: Signiﬁcance of hybridization in asexual
fungal endophytes of grasses
Funding: Swiss NSF
Project description: Interspeciﬁc hybridization with
creation of new lineages or species is a well known phe-
nomenon in plants and animals, but is largely unex-
plored in fungi. Asexual Epichlo¨ e endophytes of grasses
(referred to the anamorph genus Neotyphodium) rep-
resent the most prominent case of abundant interspe-
ciﬁc hybridizations. Epichlo¨ e endophytes (Ascomycota,
Clavicipitaceae) are wide-spread in pooid grasses form-
ing systemic associations with their hosts that span
the continuum from antagonism to mutualism. TheNovember 1, 2007 EvolDir 17
majority of Neotyphodium endophytes that have been
analyzed phylogenetically are heteroploid hybrids with
two or more sexual Epichlo¨ e species as ancestors. Hy-
brids are maintained through successive host genera-
tions by vertical transmission and often dominate in
natural populations and over large geographical ranges.
It has been suggested that hybridizations provide a se-
lective advantage over non-hybrids by substituting for
sexual recombination or by acquiring beneﬁcial genes
that strengthen their mutualistic capabilities. How-
ever, none of these hypotheses has been tested. The
overall objective of this research proposal is to inves-
tigate the signiﬁcance of hybrid Neotyphodium endo-
phytes for the ecological ﬁtness of their host plants in
diﬀerent environments. As study system we will use the
woodland grass Hordelymus europaeus that is known to
be host of hybrid and non-hybrid endophytes. Epichlo¨ e
endophytes oﬀer a model system on which fundamental
questions regarding the evolution of mutualisms can be
studied.
We are seeking a highly motivated doctoral student
with strong interests in evolutionary biology and my-
cology. Candidates should have a Diploma or Master’s
degree in Biology or Plant Sciences.

colonies in diﬀerent parts of the P. metricus range to
better understand the ecological constraints faced by
wasp colonies in diﬀerent regions and how these eco-
logical diﬀerences aﬀect social structure. These studieswill also aid in the interpretation of work examining
the genetic basis for helping and foraging behavior, to
be carried out in other, collaborating labs. This is an

Applicants are invited for a new Ph.D. position in Inte-
grated Bioscience at the University of Akron. We seek
a student interested in combining paleontology with
evolutionary reproductive biology to assess the long-
term evolution of breeding systems in “conchostracan”
crustaceans (“clam shrimp”). We have a unique set

environment with breeding system within conchostraca
over evolutionary time. Such a long-term association
would be exceptional within breeding system evolu-
tionary studies. The ideal applicant would have some
background in both paleontology and evolutionary bi-
ology or a background in only one area but be eager
to learn the alternate area of study. The PhD posi-
tion comes with full tuition remission plus a stipend
of $20,000 per year for a total of 5 years. Applica-
tions are being sought for positions beginning in August
2008. For more information, please contact Dr. Steve

UAlaska SelfIncompatibility
We currently have NSF funding for an MS or PhD level
student to work on the evolution of self-incompatibility
genes in poppies (Papaveraceae) at the University of
Alaska.The ideal student for this project will either have molec-
ular lab skills (such as DNA sequencing), and/or data
analysis skills (math, computer, coalescence theory).
However, all high-quality students with an interest
in evolutionary genetics are encouraged to apply for
Spring or Fall admission.
Alaska oﬀers unparalleled beauty, untouched land-
scapes, and unique research opportunities, as well as
an extreme climate and unique culture. Research at
UA includes topics such as adaptations to our extreme
climate, the unique evolutionary history of organisms
inﬂuenced by glacial cycles and migrations from both
North American and Asia, climate change, how interac-
tions among species inﬂuence community composition.
The goal of the project is to sequence and identify self-
incompatibility alleles from the genus Papaver, and in-
vestigate the patterns of molecular evolution at this lo-
cus. Students will also be encouraged to develop their
own interests in areas related to this project. For in-
stance, investigating the number of self-incompatibility
alleles and mate availability in Papaver species with
diﬀerent evolutionary histories. There are several rare
(federally listed) poppy species in Alaska which are
not found elsewhere in North America, and there is
likely to be interesting conservation work that can be
done on these species, such as investigating their self-
incompatibility status and ability to ﬁnd mates, lev-
els of genetic diversity, and their divergence from east-
ern Russian populations, and relationships to other
Beringian poppies. There are also opportunities for de-
veloping theory on the evolution of self-incompatibility
genes.

PhD student in Plant Biology
The Laboratory of Plant Systematics is part of the De-

lab has a strong expertise in plant systematics, includ-
ing ﬂower morphology and ontogeny, evodevo, palynol-
ogy, molecular systematics, wood and seed anatomy.28 EvolDir November 1, 2007
Our team include three postdocs, 12 PhD students and
two lab technicians.
We now seek a PhD student to build complementary ex-
pertise in bioinformatics and mathematical modelling.
Project: Compilation, informatisation and analysis of
morphological and anatomical data
What is the evolutionary base for morphological dif-
ferences between plants? How do these diﬀerences
emerge during development and how are they geneti-
cally determined? To date it is hard to answer these
questions since we do not have the ICT-tools to inte-
grate develop mental genetics and comparative mor-
phology/anatomy. We want to tackle this problem
by developing a database with morphological charac-
ters for a large group of ﬂowering plants (basal as-
terids). This database will ﬁll three needs: (1) mor-
phological observations could be linked to mutant phe-
notypes using a common terminology (ontology); (2)
mathematical models that explain plant development
can be tested; (3) morphological data become accessi-
ble for statistic and evolutionary analyses. In a ﬁrst
phase, a databank will be designed based on an ex-
isting database for animal-data, but adapted to the
speciﬁc terminology of ﬂowering plants. In a second
phase, available observations and data from literature
are loaded. In a last phase speciﬁc hypotheses and mod-
els can be tested based on the data.
Qualiﬁcation requirements: Applicants should have a
MSc or equivalent in Biology, Bioinformatics or Bio-
engineering with a strong interest in the natural world
and programming. Funding is provided for 2 years
(100%) and the candidate will be encouraged to enter a

CostaRica FieldAssist
MonkeyEvolution
Position- Field assistant, Capuchins, Behavioral En-
docrinology, Costa Rica
Hiring Organization: Colleen Gault- aﬃliated with Liv-
ing Links Center, Emory University and Lomas Barbu-
dal Monkey Project
Position Description: I am looking for 2 ﬁeld as-
sistants to collect behavioral data and fecal samples
(for hormonal analysis) on a well-habituated popula-
tion of wild capuchin monkeys that have been studied
in Costa Rica since 1990 as part of the Lomas Bar-
budal Monkey Project. Information about the ﬁeld
site, past publications, working conditions, and ap-
plication instructions are available on the following
website: http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/-
sperry/jobs.html Read the detailed guide about work-
ing conditions (available in pdf form from the above
site) before applying. The position advertised here is
for a project aﬃliated with the Lomas Barbudal Mon-
key Project but life will diﬀer in several critical ways
that will make this position appeal more or less to par-
ticular applicants relative to the position oﬀered by Dr.
Susan Perry. 1) You will not live in the big yellow house
town but in a small house in a small farming village next
to the Lomas Barbudal Reserve
a. You will have fewer colleagues with which to social-
ize or to have to tolerate (only me and another ﬁeld
assistant)
b. Thus, you will either learn more Spanish, get
through your reading list, or take up a hobby
c. Public transport (to airports, beach, etc) will be less
accessible for emergencies, vacations, and visitors, but
is still easy relative to many ﬁeld sites.
d. You will not have to drive on the treacherous Pan-
American highway every day and night
e. Capuchins & Howlers will be in your backyard
f. Local discos will not keep you awake until 3am with
thunderous bass.38 EvolDir November 1, 2007
2) Data collection will involve all day rather than 10-
minute follows of individual monkeys
a. You must observe with the same monkey and all
their interactions from dawn to dusk each day and will
only have an immense sense of accomplishment after
several successful days rather than a slight accomplish-
ment after 10 successful minutes
b. You will observe the whole story’ behind the monkey
drama for your focal, rather than broken pieces.
c. This is too diﬃcult in the rainy season so we will stop
for the typical worst of it- mid Sept to mid November
3) You will collect a great deal of fecal samples
a. Capuchin feces smell like fruit, and are thus much
less disgusting than yours, your dog’s or your cat’s.
b. You will help ﬁeld extractions of the feces, which
involves the use of worse smelling chemicals such as
acetone.
4) You won’t be taking detailed data on Sloanea pro-
cessing
5) I will be teaching kids in the local elementary school
about the monkeys & the forest. You will be able to
choose your level of involvement in this, but it will be
a great way to be less of an outsider in the community
in which you’ll live.
Qualiﬁcations/Experience: Anyone can apply, but we
prefer candidates with some course work in animal be-
havior, some prior ﬁeld experience, and some Spanish
language skills. Some of these requirements can be
waived for candidates that are exceptionally well quali-
ﬁed in other ways. Must have medical insurance. Must
be willing to work extremely hard, as our schedule is
grueling.
Salary/funding: See below - no salary, but we cover es-
sentially all of your expenses. Depending on the grant
funding, approximately $100/month is provided for in-
cidental expenses as well.
Support provided for internship/volunteer positions
(travel, meals, lodging): Room and board are provided,
and up to $1000 is provided for the plane fare, contin-
gent upon completion of the work agreed upon. You
must provide your own medical insurance and cover
your own medical costs.
Term of Appointment: Two available time slots: March
2008- mid Sept 2009 and December 2009-mid Sept 2010.
Applicants that cannot begin until May 08 will be con-
sidered, and other variations on these dates may be
possible, but a 6 month commitment is required.
Application Deadline: Rolling deadline. To apply, fol-low the instructions at http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/-
anthro/faculty/sperry/jobs.html, but send application
materials to Colleen Gault at the addresses listed below,
and cc them to Susan Perry (sperry@anthro.ucla.edu),

Dear Evoldir Members–
I have received a number of inquiries about the scope
of this job advertisement. I would like to emphasize
that we are searching broadly in Evolutionary Biology
(i.e. “The Department of Biological Sciences at Stan-
ford University seeks applicants for a tenure track fac-
ulty appointment in Evolutionary Biology” and “We
seek applicants studying problems in any area of Evo-
lutionary Biology”) and will seriously consider any can-
didate who works in any area of evolutionary biology
even if they do not work in the ﬁeld of evolution of
development.
We do speciﬁcally encourage applications of those who
work in the evolution of development. However, we con-
strue this ﬁeld more broadly that what is conventional
understood by evodevo. We deﬁne the ﬁeld to include
any work focused on understanding mechanisms of phe-
notypic evolution.

Uppsala University hereby declares the following posi-
tion to be open for application
*Associate professor/Senior Lecturer in Population Bi-
ology and Conservation Biology*
(with the possibility of being employed as a Professor)
at the Department of Ecology and Evolution, Popula-
tion Biology and Conservation Biology
*Description of position*: The research area includes
population biology and conservation biology. Popula-
tion biology is the study of processes leading to the
adaptation of organisms to their environment. A cen-
tral theme is the maintenance of genetic variation and
how it shapes phenotypes in conjunction with diﬀeren-
tial survival and reproduction. Conservation biology is
the study of how natural and anthropogenic processes
aﬀect the diversity of phenotypes and the genetic di-
versity at the levels of individuals and populations.
*Nature of duties:* The position includes teaching at
graduate and undergraduate level, research, and admin-
istration. Teaching duties include course responsibil-
ity, course administration and supervising of Ph.D. stu-
dents. Teaching will primarily be in ecology, population
biology and conservation biology at basic and advanced
levels, but may also include teaching on other biology
courses at the basic level. It is expected that the suc-
cessful applicant follows the developments in the area
of research and in the surrounding community, which
are of relevance for the position. It is also expected that
the applicant will actively participate in developing the
research and education proﬁle of the Department and
seek to attract external funding.
*Eligibility:* To be eligible for a position as associate
professor, the applicant must hold a Ph.D and have
completed suitable pedagogical training for teaching at
university level or have corresponding qualiﬁcations and
pedagogical skills. Uppsala Universitys general employ-
ment regulations also require that teachers have any
other skills which are necessary to carry out their du-
ties proﬁciently.November 1, 2007 EvolDir 59
The ability to teach in Swedish or English is a require-
ment. The successful candidate is expected to teach in
Swedish within two years from appointment.

skills. When judging teaching skills, consideration will
be given to experience and planning, carrying out and
evaluating teaching and examinations, and supervising
students. When judging scientiﬁc proﬁciency special
importance will be attached to research qualiﬁcations
in population biology with connection to conservation
biology.
Under the University Ordinance, those ﬁlling a posi-
tion as lecturer must also have demonstrated the teach-
ing ability required for the post and furthermore, ex-
cept in special circumstances, must have completed a
programme of training relevant for teaching within the
University. Candidates’ teaching competence including
the planning, carrying out and evaluation of teaching
and examinations, as well as the supervision of stu-
dents, will be evaluated. Documentation of teaching
skills must be presented in a way that allows qualita-
tive assessment.
The candidates aptitude in interacting with the sur-
rounding community, informing people about research
and development work, and the degree to which the

Batch runs of STRUCTURE
Dear All,
I’m running STRUCTURE to recover population struc-
ture with a microsatellite data set. I’ve created a
project and can start runs by selecting ’Parameter Set’
in the toolbar and then selecting ’Run’. I can then run
the program for one value of K and only one replicate.
This works perfectly.
With this same project, I tried to schedule a series of
runs by going to ’Project’ and then ’Start a Job’. I se-
lected the parameters set, values of K and the number
of run for each and then pressed ’Start’. A ’Structure
Job Log’ windows appears saying ’Start the Job ...’ but
stays like that for days, even if the batch should only
take a couple of hours maximum. Did anyone encoun-
tered that problem before or does anyone know what
could cause this problem?
I’m using STRUCTURE 2.2 (March 2007) and tried on
three diﬀerent computers but had the same problem on
each.
Thanks in advance for your answers,
Best regards,

For one year, I collected insects at 4 diﬀerent sites, al-
though close among each other, using 4 diﬀerent meth-
ods every two weeks and it was to see if the species
collected from the ﬁrst day are also collected in the
next (two weeks later) collecting and the next, and so
on. Interestingly, about 70% of the ﬁrst-time collected
insects were collected again in the next collection.
I wonder if you know any good reference on such study?
I have seen many papers and reports regarding com-
parisons of diﬀerent collecting methods, but I couldn’t
ﬁnd good papers on frequency of collecting insect for
the purpose of faunistic survey. Please send me papers
or let me know the references. Thank you in advance.

mantezan@bsd.uchicago.eduDMSO preservation
Dear Evoldir,
In our lab we have many lizards tips of tails preserved
in 20% DMSO (6M NaCl + DMSO), some for more
than ten years, and we are having problems extracting
DNA from the oldest ones. My question is about the
best way to preserve the more recent ones: should we
change DMSO solution frequently, should we add more
salt? How much volume of DMSO solution should we
use relative to the volume of the tissue? Another ques-
tion is if we can change the biological material that is
currently in DMSO into ethanol.
Best regards and thanks in advance.

DMSO preservation answers
Dear all, Thank you very much to everyone that replied
to my questions about tissue preservation in DMSO.
Replying to Si: we have been able to extract high molec-
ular weight DNA from samples preserved in 20% DMSO
for 8 years but some other samples gave very bad ex-
tractions and they were 6 years old. It is possible that
the ratio of tissue to solution is an important factor in
our case. Below are all the answers I got. Thanks again
to everyone. Soﬁa
I personally am not a fan of storing tissue in 20% DMSO
as I’ve also had problems with extractions. Perhaps
short-term storage is ok, particularly as there may be
issues with samples in ethanol in the post. If I receive
samples in DMSO, I rinse them with dH20 and change
them into 70% or 80% ethanol. I have had no trouble
with long-term storage in ethanol, even when stored at
room temperature. Regards Maria
In our lab, we have always stored tail tips in 100%
EtOh, cutting the tissue into smaller pieces, ratio of
tissue to EtOH, c. 10x Such material has been ﬁne for68 EvolDir November 1, 2007
10 years plus. I have always assumed that the EtOH re-
moves the DNA from aqueous solution, hence stopping
aqueous enzymatic processes.
Re: your issue, you may want to transfer the tissues
into EtOH. I’m no expert on the 20% DMSO, salt is-
sue, but the DMSO is just there to deliver the very high
salt concentration into the cells of the tissue to prevent
DNAases etc.. working to degrade the DNA.
Just out of interest, how long have your workable sam-
ples (eg obtaining high molecular weight DNA out of
them) been in the 20% DMSO solution - I’ve only just
started working with it and would like to predict life
spans of my samples.

If it helps, Dawson /et al/. (1998) examined the ef-
fects of ﬁve storage solutions and three temperature
regimes on marine invertebrate tissue and found that
the greater the duration of storage prior to analy-
sis, the greater the degradation of the sample, and
greater degradation occurs at higher storage temper-
ature (room temperature). The Preservation of DNA
was most successful with dimethylsulfoxide and sodium
chloride (DMSO-NaCl) and 70% ethanol.

We have collected cetacean and turtle tissue in salt-
saturated 20% DMSO for up to 15 years. We also
ﬁnd that some of our older samples have degraded
and we get no or little DNA out of them. We still
collect some samples in DMSO, but we freeze them all
now rather than storing them at room temperature.
We try to keep the ratio of DMSO to sample greater
than 5:1. Whenever possible we collect samples in
90% ethanol now (also stored frozen), or store sam-
ples just frozen, and changed after initial collection
because it can become diluted by the water in the
sample. Changing the DMSO is also a good idea,
as it can become acidiﬁed. I don’t know how to’rescue’ your older samples, but would recommend
that you do extractions on all of them as soon as
possible to obtain DNA before it becomes further
degraded. Phil – Phillip A. Morin, Ph.D. South-

We at STRI use 0.25 M EDTA instead of pure water to
mix up the 20% + NaCl. We add NaCl to saturation
and then some more.
Some people keep their samples in 4C but I keep mine
in -20C or -80C if I am not using them anytime soon.
I have transfered from EtOH to DMSO but never the
other way around. Should be OK, if you want to do
it... Let me know if you receive any other “hot tips”
from EvolDir, eh?

Job trends survey
My name is Robert Shupe and I am an undergradu-
ate student considering going to graduate school and
getting a PhD in Ecology or Evolution. Upon investi-
gating the various opportunities available I found more
questions than answers. After discussing the issue with
some members of the faculty at my institution, I was
troubled to learn that there is little concrete informa-
tion regarding job-prospects upon ﬁnishing graduate
school. Therefore, with the help of Dr. Jonathan C.
Marshall, Southern Utah University, I have put to-
gether a simple survey to help provide more trans-
parency regarding the job-outlook for those who may
have similar interests and concerns as I do.
If you have landed your ﬁrst tenure-track, international
equivalent, or other permanent position within the last
4 years I would be very grateful if you would take a few
minutes to respond to this survey.
http://FreeOnlineSurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=-
02qabm52zm9s4rg353289 I believe a summary of the
survey results will be quite valuable to individualsconsidering graduate school. I also believe graduate
students will be able to use the results as a bench
mark for what they need to do (i.e. publications,
etc.) during graduate school in order to eventually
compete for a tenure-track position. All responses are
anonymous.
Thanks in advance for your time.

Job trends survey 2
We have had a tremendous response to our survey in
very short period of time. We would ﬁrst like to thank
everybody that has participated so far and encourage
those of you who have not to do so. We would like
to clarify one aspect of the survey. In the instructions
we stated ¨ ı¿1
2Please answer questions as appropriate at
the time of your hire¨ ı¿1
2but this was not written in
bold text and was very easy to miss. This has led to
some confusion on questions asking about your number
of publications. Please indicate the number of publi-
cations you had at your time of hiring. Also to help
decrease the time in takes to do the survey I have in-
cluded a quick link to a list of impact factors below.
Based on the many enthusiastic emails I have received
it appears there is a real need for the dissemination of
these kinds of data. In fact, many excellent suggests
have been made to expand the questions to include
starting salaries, extending hiring time periods, inclu-
sion of government and non-proﬁt jobs, etc. These are
all things we will be considering for a second survey.
Thanks again to all those who have and will be partic-
ipating.

Mismatch distribution question
Dear Evoldir users,
I am using Arlequin (v.3.1) in order to perform a
mismatch distribution analysis on mtDNA (Dloop) se-
quences. My dataset includes two divergent clades
(6.5%). I used it in order to perform mismatch distribu-
tion under both models (demographic= >SSD =0.008,
p=0.24, r=0.004, p=0.45 and range expansion= >SSD
=0.008, p=0.46, r=0.004, p=0.91, M.206, neutrality
tests=>D=-0.56, p=0.337 and Fs=-23.98, p=0.001).
My mismatch distribution is multimodal (peak at zero,
11 and 21 diﬀerences). Is this the result of simulta-
neous study of the two diverged groups (the within
and between group comparisons)? Although I have a
multimodal distribution both models are not rejected.
Can I infer from D and F values that what I see is
probably a spatial rather than a demographic expan-
sion (since for low Nm values D is not too powerful
while Fs is more eﬃcient)? Do I really get any in-
formation through the mismatch distribution of both
groups (clades)? In other words is it better to start
from the bottom level of structural hierarchy (depicted
by mtDNA and/or msats) and move upwards? High
frequency of 0 and 1 mismatches is an indication of spa-
tial expansion? In order to estimate 2u can I use the

Old electrophoresis equipment
Dear all,
I am looking to buy second hand equipment for cellu-
lose acetate allozyme electrophoresis. Many labs have
used allozymes in the past, but have now switched to
diﬀerent methods. However, I am still using them to
analyze competition assays between diﬀerent strains of
Daphnia. Thus, if anyone has old but still functional
equipment laying around, I would be interested in buy-
ing it.
Speciﬁcally, I am using 76 x 76 mm gels from Helena
laboratories, and I am looking for gel tanks, power sup-
plies, and applicator kits (including well plates and ap-
plicators) that are compatible with these gels.
Many thanks in advance for any oﬀers,

SNP analysis
Running and analyzing fragments in Applied Byosis-
tems 3130
We have some problems with SNPs genotyping using
the SNaPshot platform from Applied (I think the prob-
lem would be the same with microsatellites).
My department purchased a 3130AB sequencer (4 cap-
illaries) that is mostly used for sequencing. The se-
quences are processed by the data collection software
and then we analyze them using Phred-Phrap-Cnsed
(we did not purchased the Applied Seqscape soft-
ware,for sequencing analyses).
I decided to use the sequencer for SNPs genotyping (and
there are people interested in running microsatellites),but we do not have the Applied’s GeneMapper software
for fragment analysis. I purchased the Matrix Standard
set (DS-02) and performed the spectral calibration to
be able to run fragments. The problem now is that
when I want to perform a run, I don’t have the op-
tion to run fragments in the sequencer. I only have the
options to run sequences and to perform a spectral cali-
bration. I called the Applied people here in Brazil, and
they told me that this is because I didn’t purchase the
GeneMapper (that cost around US$ 10000).
I understand that one aspect is the data collection soft-
ware to control the run and collect the data, another
one is the software for data analysis, which is what Gen-
eMapper does, and I suspect the ﬁrst should be (more
or less?) independent from the second. In other words,
Applied people should allow me to run fragments, and
then let me decide how to analyze them, as in the case
of sequencing.
Actually, I suspect Applied people are trying to “per-
suading” me to purchase their software GeneMapper,
which is something I am considering, but I would like
to know if I have the option of not doing that.
I don’t know if anyone may send me any feedback.
Speciﬁcally, I would like to know if someone had have
a similar problem, and if someone have the experience
of running fragments in a 3130 Applied even without
having the GeneMapper software. In this case, do you
know if Applied installed the modules for running frag-
ment.

SNP haplotypes
Hi there
We are looking to test the performance of diﬀerent
programs/algorithms for the inferrence of haplotypes
from diploid SNP data (from genotyping and/or di-
rect sequencing). We will use empirical data sets from
conifers, for which we have SNP genotypes from the
diploids, as well as sequences from their gametes.
Recommendations, anyone? I’d appreciate it if you72 EvolDir November 1, 2007
could circulate this request to any of your colleagues
who have developed methods or have other experience
with this problem.
I’ll post all responses.
Thanks,

Software EvolveAGene 3
EvolveAGene 3 is a realistic coding sequence simula-
tion program that separates mutation from selection
and allows the user to set selection conditions, includ-
ing variable regions of selection intensity, positive or
purifying, within the sequence and variation in inten-
sity of selection over branches. Variation includes base
substitutions, insertions and deletions. Output includes
a log ﬁle, the true tree and both unaligned coding se-
quence and protein sequences and the true DNA and
protein alignments.
As far as I know EvolveAGene is the only simulation
program designed speciﬁcally for coding sequences.
Availability: The package ht includes Mac OS X
and Windows executables, Perl source code and
a detailed manual can be downloaded from from

Barry G. Hall
barryhall@zeninternet.comSoftware Lamarc 2 1 2
We have just released LAMARC 2.1.2. The LAMARC
program estimates population parameters such as eﬀec-
tive population size, migration rates, growth rates, and
recombination rate from population samples of molec-
ular data. It can also map genetic traits via linkage
disequilibrium.
To the best of our knowledge, previous successful runs
with version 2.1.1 are correct and do not need to be re-
peated. However, we have made several improvements
to the program’s capabilities, and some data sets which
could not previously be analyzed will now work. The
most signiﬁcant changes are:
(1) Cases with high recombination rates now run much
faster; as a result higher recombination and/or longer
sequences are now feasible. This is particularly useful in
linkage disequilibrium mapping. Previously for human-
like data LAMARC could only feasibly map within an
area of 0.01 centimorgans; it can now easily do 0.2 cen-
timorgans and, laboriously, up to 0.5 on a desktop com-
puter.
(2) Cases in which the mutation rates of diﬀerent ge-
nomic regions are drawn from a gamma distribution can
be more reliably maximized. If maximization failed in
such a case, re-running with 2.1.2 may solve the prob-
lem. Data sets which did not fail do not need to be
re-run.
(3) Compatibility with TRACER (Rambaut and Drum-
mond 2004) has been improved. Cases with migration
now produce usable traceﬁles, and the probability of
the sequence data on the genealogy is now recorded in
both Bayesian and likelihood runs.
(4) The “unknown data” symbol “?” is now recognized
for microsatellite data.
LAMARC 2.1.2 is available for free download (source
code and executables for Linux, Mac and Windows)

Software MaxAlign
Dear colleagues at evoldir:
As most of us, we suﬀered from our alignments contain-
ing many annoying gaps!! We decided to do something
against it and our solution was now baptized “Max-
Align”.
MaxAlign removes sequences from alignments in order
to improve the quality of the alignment. You can use
it after an alignment, or use it after the alignment is
complete, and then realign the sequences. MaxAlign is
extremely helpful when your analysis excludes columns
with gaps or to ﬁnd truncated or non-homologous se-
quences.
You can use MaxAlign online or download it to use
locally. The URL is:
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MaxAlign/ The arti-
cle can be read here:

Software Paraﬁt
Dear Community,
This is to announce the availability of a highly op-
timized and parallelized version of Pierre Legendre’s
Paraﬁt program, which implements a statistical test
for host-parasite co-evolution (Pierre Legendre, Yves
Desdevises, Eric Bazin: “A Statistical Test for Host-
Parasite Coevolution”, Systematic Biology 51(2):217-
234, 2002.).
The sequential version runs up to 67 times faster than
the original Paraﬁt program while the speedup in-
creases with dataset size. The parallel version scales
well up to 128 CPUs on datasets of moderate size.
With the parallel version of AxParaﬁt we were able
to conduct the largest Paraﬁt-based analysis to date.The inference took only 8 minutes as opposed to an
estimated runtime of about 4 weeks with Paraﬁt (esti-
mated because the machine on which Paraﬁt was run-
ning crashed).
The software, including a manual, is available as
open source code or pre-compiled binaries at http:/-
/icwww.epﬂ.ch/˜stamatak/AxParaﬁt.html .

Software phylogenetic canonical
correlation
pcca is a simple new program for Phylogenetic Canoni-
cal Correlation Analysis and is available from my web-
site at:
http://anolis.oeb.harvard.edu/˜liam/programs/ pcca
uses a phylogenetic tree and measurements for an ar-
bitrary number of continuous characters to perform a
PGLS transformation of the data and then calculate
canonical scores, weights, and correlations, and con-
duct hypothesis tests about the canonical correlations.
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a procedure by
which two sets of derived variables are calculated from
two sets of original variables whereby the correlations
between corresponding derived variables is maximized.
The program can also compute the maximum likeli-
hood estimate (MLE) of a multivariate Pagel’s (1999)
lambda, and perform the PGLS transformation using
the MLE of lambda (following Freckleton et al. 2002),
or lambda set to 0.0 or 1.0. lamda set to 0.0 is, of course,
identical to performing CCA ignoring phylogeny. If the74 EvolDir November 1, 2007
MLE of lambda is used, likelihood ratios and signiﬁ-
cances of the null hypothesis that lambda = 0.0 or 1.0
are also returned. Maximum likelihood estimation is
very slow in the current version and is restricted to the
interval 0 <= lambda <= 1.0.
pcca can easily process multiple trees and datasets in
sequence.
pcca is supported by a detailed manual and is avail-
able as a Linux binary, a Mac OS X binary, and a
DOS/Windows executable.
This is a Beta version of the program. Please let me
know if you ﬁnd any diﬃculties or errors with the pro-
gram.

Software Tracer v1 4
Tracer v1.4 has been released and posted on my web-
site:
<http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer >
Tracer is a program for analysing the trace ﬁles gener-
ated by Bayesian MCMC runs (that is, the continuous
parameter values sampled from the chain). It can be
used to analyse runs of BEAST, MrBayes, LAMARC
and possibly other MCMC programs.
The oﬃcial webpage is on the BEAST website:
<http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer >
However, this is very limited at present. I hope to add
more detailed documentation when I have time (the
website is a Wiki so please feel free to add you own tips
for using Tracer).
This version is almost a complete rewrite and has many
new features (and probably a few new bugs too).
A few of the new features are:
Overlay distributions from diﬀerent ﬁles and statistics
More control over plotting
Export of graphics as PDFs and raw data from most
views
Calculation of Bayes Factors to compare runs with dif-
ferent modelsOverlay demographics reconstructions including Sky-
line plots
Translucent points for joint-marginal densities
Faster and more accurate ESS analysis
One diﬀerence from version 1.3 is that it requires Java
1.5 or better to run. This will probably only aﬀect older
versions of Mac OS X: Java 1.5 comes as default on
Tiger (Mac OS X 10.4) but requires installing on Mac
OS X 10.3 (visit the Apple website for these updates).

subSTRUCTURE question
Hello all.
I’m using software STRUCTURE to determine sub-
structure in one natural, isolated population of trees.
In all combinations of ancestry models and allele fre-
quencies (except for no admixture model&independent
allele frequencies) I have K=3 with probability 1. Also
in this exceptional case, using EVANO method I have
K=3. This is little bit confusing because I have sam-
pled all adult trees (420) and population occupies area
less than 0.8ha. This means that I have 3 diﬀerent
’genepools’ in such small area. So, I was hoping to
hear if somebody else had similar situation with sub-
structure in single population and also if there are some
references for this scenario. Thanks in advance. Any-
way, software is excellent, it ﬁts perfectly with rest of
my data (9 more populations).

Hello again.
Thanks greatly for replies: David Remington, Mar-
tin Lascoux, Alan Meerow, Guy Hoelzer, Carlos, Ma-
ciek, Steve Keller, Anna-Karin, Miguel Angel Toro
Ib¨ ı¿1
2¨ ı¿1
2ez. Here I compile all replies and, as suggested
by Alan Meerow and Steve Keller, I give some addi-
tional information important for ﬁnal conclusion.
Picea omorika is tertiary relict and endemic, widely dis-
tributed before, now app 40 scattered natural popu-
lations, up to several hundred trees each. Pollen and
seed dispersed by wind, probably limited (distances not
known).
Outcrossing but self-fertile, inbreeding depression in
later life stages. I don¨ ı¿1
2t have any information if
non-random matting is present, vegetative propagation
present but not signiﬁcant (Alan Meerow). It is not
morphologically uniform and there is no lack of genetic
diversity (surprisingly, but true).
Scores for SSRs as well as for one mt marker highly
repeatable, at least 2 alleles/locus sequenced (Maciek
suggested technical artefact).
There are for sure at least 2 subpop, because when
I run STRUCTURE with K20 (absurd), one group
of trees stick together. They are recent immigrants
(based on presence of certain alleles), but I can not
pinpoint source population because of mt haplotypes
(mt DNA transferred by seed). Probably I do not have
this population(s) in my sample set. Another fact ¨ ı¿1
2
mt haplotypes in whole pop are population speciﬁc (!).
David Remington suggested that if source pop is al-
most always found in admixed individuals, substruc-
ture is probably some sort of artifact even if it seems
well-supported statistically.
Doubts that I still have are because of the rest of the
population ¨ ı¿1
2should I consider the rest of the popula-
tion as 1 group or 2. As suggested by Martin Lascoux,
Guy Hoelzer, Carlos, maybe the rest of the population
is family (due to inbreeding), one or 2 sibships with
LD between loci and deviations from HWE propor-
tions. Solution ¨ ı¿1
2InStruct instead of STRUCTURE
and Colony to check that.
On the other hand, if there are 2 more subpop, in each
of them LD in only between 1 or 2 pairs of loci and
deviations from HWE proportions are almost insignif-
icant (STRUCTURE actually did clustering based on
this). There is excess of heterozygotes in each of them!
Maybe there is non-random matting after all, but I¨ ı¿1
2m
reluctant to assume that. Steve Keller¨ ı¿1
2s suggestion is
recent admixture event with colonists which were drawn
from 3 previously isolated populations (for 3 subpop).
Maybe that is the case ¨ ı¿1
2several reinforcements, butonly from certain source populations (due to presence
of mt haplotypes) and only now and that, due to certain
environmental conditions eg storms (spatial pattern of
mt haplotypes is in waves!).
Finally, I still have to check few more things, but if
you have more suggestions, please sent them again.
THANK YOU!!!

Survey AntiEvol ideas
Greetings!
I’m looking for survey data on the reasons why people
reject evolution. My hunch is that most people who
reject evolution do so because they don’t want to be
connected to the animal world - they don’t want to be
“from monkeys” or the primodial slime. I’d like to see
whether any data exist that could be brought to bear
on this hypothesis. Thanks.

Barb Edmunds at Portland State sad that Eric Lovely
at Arkanas Tech “had a poster entitled ”Teaching Evo-
lution: Challenging Religious Preconceptions“ at the
SICB conference in 2006. He was asking for collabo-
rators in other areas of the country, so I am assuming
that this research is on-going.”
Joe Graves at NC A&T State responded:
>>Dear Norman, There is some discussion of this
question in a book entitled: Cult Archaeology and
Creationism: Understanding Pseudoscientiﬁc Beliefs
About the Past, F.B. Harrold and R.A. Eve, U. Iowa

explicitly addresses the question you are posing. The
title “Monkey Girl” in Ed Humes, Monkey Girl: Evolu-
tion, Education, Religion, and the Battle for America’s

you may be on to something here.
We are planning to do a large survey of student veiws
on evolution here at North Carolina A&T State Uni-

Several of the responses I received were similar to David
Fitch’s
>>Not being a creationist myself, I do not have per-
sonal experience. However, many of my students have
been creationists (yes, even here in New York City). So
my data is anecdotal, not quantitative. But here aresome insights I’ve inferred:
The overarching fear is that, if evolution is true, then
God did not create, and thus God does not exist. A cor-
relary to this miscarriage of logic is that, if God does
not exist, we would be plunged into a world without
morality or ethics, and basically it would be okay to
loot, murder and rape at will. Thus the equation that
is made between evolution and evil. The alliteration of
these two words also doesn’t help.
The connection to the animal world is secondary to this
major fear, but it’s linked, because animals are not sup-
posed to have a moral code. Even otherwise reputable
scientists like Francis Collins (“Language of God”) be-
lieve there is something divine about the Moral Law
(Collins’ “evidence” of God). Another connected fear
is the lack of purpose to our lives if we are only products
of a mindless evolutionary process.
That’s why I think it is very important in our teaching
to emphasize that scientists canNOT prove or disprove
the existence of God (i.e., science is not atheistic, but
rather agnostic, in the sense that it cannot disprove su-
pernatural phenomena/mechanisms), as well as to ex-
pose the faulty logic that gives rise to this fear. An-
other thing that is important for us to do as teachers
is to show that understanding how life works gives us
a greater appreciation and respect for our fellow beings
and life in general. (A value system that actually seems
to conform more to buddhist than judeo-christian- is-
lamic principles.) The answer to purpose, of course,
comes from ourselves–we give purpose and meaning to
our own lives.
Best wishes, Dave <<

Nervous systems are some of the most complex ma-
chines in our universe. The myriad of signaling mecha-
nisms within nerve cells, the billions of nerve cells and
trillions of connection (most of them are unique) are
truly wonders of enormous proportions. Yet extant ner-
vous systems are the way they are because they have
been molded by millions of years of evolution. Thus, ex-
cluding evolution from modern training programs in the
neurosciences removes the opportunity to fully under-
stand the modern manifestations of nervous systems by
tracking the lineages and constraints that have molded
them. Indeed, it is arguable that we can only fully
understand the complexity of nervous systems if we ex-
amine them, their components, signaling pathways and
properties from an evolutionary perspective. This pro-
gram, the ﬁrst of its kind in the US, will confront this
signiﬁcant deﬁciency in graduate/undergraduate neu-
roscience training and will do so in the framework of
an integrated program that encompasses evolution, ge-
nomics, proteomics, neuroscience, ands bioinformatics.
It will provide the students with the technical and intel-
lectual tools with which to capitalize both on the enor-
mous diversity of animal lineages and species available
at FHL and on wealth of information that studies of
nervous system evolution can provide, thereby position-
ing them to make major inroads into our understanding
of the complexity and functionality of nervous systems.
It will also provide students with the experimental ad-
vantages of simple nervous systems for technology de-
velopment.
Modern bioanalytical tools will be used to identify sig-
nal molecules (at the single-cell resolution) in variety
of marine organisms with key positions in the evolu-
tionary tree of life. Indeed, nervous systems of ani-
mals are diverse and their organization and function
reﬂect unique adaptations of an organism to its envi-
ronment. Chemical messengers used to pattern the de-
veloping nervous system are recruited for nervous sys-
tem function in the adult. While such signal molecules
and related molecular markers have been well charac-
terized in model organisms, i.e. Drosophila and C. ele-
gans, little information exists about the speciﬁc signal-
ing molecules patterning the nervous system in many
marine invertebrate species. For some lineages such
as ctenophores, sponges, placozoa and even many bi-
laterian phyla such information does not exist at all.
Therefore, our training projects will be perfectly over-
lap with key research questions to ﬁll numerous gaps
in our understanding the diversity and evolution of sig-
nal molecules and development of integrative systems
in animals.
In fact, the emerging ﬁelds of single cell genomics and78 EvolDir November 1, 2007
microanalysis (areas of expertise of the Moroz lab) as
well as novel technologies for imaging of complex molec-
ular machinery in living cells call for urgent changes
in education with an integration of diﬀerent disciplines
under the uniﬁed training program. Thus, interdisci-
plinary approaches will be the leading philosophy of
the course.

Weevil samples
Dear fellows,
I want to introduce myself shortly. This year I con-
centrated my eﬀorts on the collection of short nosed
weevils (Entiminae), as I am doing a work on the phy-
logeny of the mid-european short nosed weevils. I want
to do a molecular phylogeny based on 18S and ITS2
sequences. Due to ﬁnancial restrictions my collection
area is mainly focused on Germany. I could collect 23
of the 30 genera that appear in Germany. Deﬁnetely
I would like to extend this work to the complete spec-
tra of genera of Entiminae, at least of Germany. As I
would not hesitate to send duplicates of my own col-
lection to colleagues, I braced up to write this EMail
holding the hope that one of you treats it the same way.
My request would be: If you can spare a beetle from
your own collection, even if it would only be a leg of a
beetle, I would be pleased if you replied to this mail.
I added a search list of genera as an attachment. Cer-
tainly I would even be happy about other information,if for example you would know someone, who especially
devotes himself to short nosed weevils. Hope I can help
another time as well.

Post doctoral fellowship: Analysis of population genet-
ics data in the framework of network theory.
The candidate will join a team of ecologists, evolution-
ary biologists and physicists working on the adapta-
tion of the statistical tools developed in the framework
of network theory to the analysis of population genet-
ics data. This work will consist in adapting analysis
to datasets altogether with the participants of the Re-
sponsive Mode Program GBIRM of the network of ex-
cellence MARBEF ( http://www.marbef.org/projects/-
gbirm ), in close collaboration with the European
project EDEN (Ecological Diversity and Evolutionary
Networks: http://iﬁsc.uib.es/EDEN/ ). During the last
decades, the principles of networks have been shown to
apply to a wide variety of biological phenomena, from
ecosystems to food webs, or gene expression. Recently
we applied successfully network tools to molecular data
to extract information as to the dynamics of organisms
and populations (Hernandez-Garcia et al. 2006, Rozen-
feld et al. 2007, Rozenfeld et al. submitted). Beyond
the ability to take advantage of all the information con-
tained in a dataset describing a complex system (con-
trarily to summary statistics), networks indeed present
the advantage of circumventing some of the hypothe-
sis underlying the interpretation of molecular data in
evolutionary ecology, that are seldom respected in na-
ture. It allows analyzing unstable systems and possibly
targeting populations of particular importance. The
post-doc fellow will use those methods on datasets al-
ready available for marine species in order to further
explore the prospects of applying network analysis, and
to compare them with other classical or complementary
methods such as coalescence theory.
Conditions:
The salary will be around 2000 euros net/month for aduration of 18 months (12+6). The postdoctoral fellow
will be mainly located in Brest (IFREMER, Labora-
tory Deep Environment DEEP-; France), with a pe-
riod of several weeks in Mallorca (University of the
Balearic Islands and the CSIC-UIB research institutes
IMEDEA and IFISC; Spain). Computer Science ex-
pertise and/or Bioinformatics skills are requested for

ered. Applications should be sent to Sophie ARNAUD-

A two-year, fully-funded, postdoctoral position is avail-
able in the Mullen lab at Lehigh University to inves-
tigate the genetic basis of mimicry and speciation in
North American admiral butterﬂies (genus Limenitis).84 EvolDir November 1, 2007
Mimicry has evolved multiple times in this radiation
and hybridization is widespread between closely-related
wing pattern races.
Current work in the lab is aimed at elucidating the ge-
nomic regions underlying Batesian mimicry in a poly-
morphic species complex using both QTL and linkage
disequilibrium mapping. Candidate wing patterning
and pigmentation genes, as well as other single-copy co-
dominant markers, are also being mapped to facilitate
comparisons to previously identiﬁed genome regions in-
ﬂuencing wing pattern in Heliconius butterﬂies. In ad-
dition, the successful candidate will have opportunities
to develop normalized cDNA libraries from imaginal
wing disc tissues and oversee a large-scale EST sequenc-
ing project to identify additional candidate patterning
genes.
Ideal candidates would possess a broad background
in evolutionary biology, previous experience with high
throughput DNA sequencing and genotyping, QTL
mapping, real-time PCR, cDNA library construction,
and strong analytical skills.
The position includes a competitive salary and beneﬁts
and funding is available immediately (preferred start
date is May ’08).
To apply, send a C.V., a brief description of research
interests, and contact information for three references
to Dr. Sean Mullen at sem307@lehigh.edu.

Marseille Coalescence Comparative
Phylogeography
*Post-doc fellowship :*Meta-analysis of population ge-
netic and comparative phylogeography data from sev-
eral European marine species.
*Key words*: comparative phylogeography, coales-
cence theory, vicariance, dispersion, refugia, transition
zone
*Proﬁle*: The ideal candidate should have a strong
background in genetic data analyses, in particular thoseusing the coalescent theory, and ideally programming
skills. The candidate should be autonomous for the
theoretical aspect or should have a strong potential to
update his knowledge in this domain.
*Sciencitif context: *Very few theoretical tools are
available for hypotheses testing in the ﬁeld of compara-
tive phylogeography (e.g. Hickerson et al 2006, worked
on testing a common vicariance hypothesis for a group
of species). However, the recent development of co-
alescent methods may allow to test more general hy-
potheses, such as for example the hypothesis that a
given /permeable/ barrier (e.g. the Gibraltar strait)
originated at the same date for a group of species. Ad-
ditional methods may eventually be suggested by the
candidate.
*Gbirm consortium*: The GBIRM project joins several
european research teams involved in populations genet-
ics and phylogeography of marine organisms (macro-
phytes, ﬁsh and invertebrates). Its main scientiﬁc goal
is to jointly analyse population genetic data from nu-
merous marine species in common geographic areas, in
order to reveal common patterns of the geographic dis-
tribution of genetic diversity, and to try to identify how
life history traits (e.g. presence/absence of a dispersal
phase) and environmental factors aﬀect these patterns.
*Tasks:* The members of GBIRM decided to hire a
post-doc who should provide an added value in the
joint analysis of our data sets : he would apply and, if
possible, develop analytical methods allowing hypothe-
sis testing in the ﬁeld of comparative phylogeography.
The goal of the post-doc is to analyse this multi-speciﬁc
dataset in a comparative way. The post-doc will com-
municate his results in several meetings, some already
planned : in Crete (Greece) in june 2008 to present
the results and in an international congress in Valencia
(Spain).
*Institutional Context* : consortium (Genetic biodi-
versity) of the European Network of Excellence MAR-
BEF (Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning).

Post-doctoral position [1214]
The CIRAD wishes to reinforce its competences in pop-
ulation genetics in order to understand and to predict
the evolution of populations of fungal plant pathogens.
This research aims to prevent emergences and to de-
ﬁne durable strategies to control fungal plant diseases.
The studies proposed during this post-doctoral stage
will be concentrated on the dispersal processes and the
estimate of demographic parameters in the Microcyclus
ulei fungus, main threat on rubber cultivation.
Please quote reference in all correspondence :1214 Date
of publication : 2007-10-01 Closing date :2007-11-12
Job description: The dispersal of plant pathogenic fungi
is a major factor involved in the emergence of fun-
gal plant diseases and in the adaptation of pathogen
populations. New methods in population genetics have
recently been developed to study how the landscape
aﬀects population structure (‘landscape genetics’) and
to estimate demographic parameters (eﬃcient num-
bers, introgression rate, gene ﬂow, etc.). However,
such methods do not usually take into account char-
acteristics speciﬁc to the plant pathogenic fungi, such
as large populations, frequent extinction and coloniza-
tion events, the diﬀerent types of reproduction (sex-
ual/asexual), strong selection due to interaction with
one or more hosts. The successful applicant for this
post will be required to adapt population genetics
methods to studies the dispersal of plant pathogenic
fungi. The target of the study will be Microcyclus ulei,
a fungus responsible for the main disease of rubber trees
on the American continent, whose possibilities for dis-
persion constitute today a threat for rubber tree cropsthroughout the world.
Proﬁle required: PhD in population genetics. You have
to control the theoretical bases and the methods of pop-
ulation genetics. You have got an experience in molecu-
lar markers, data analysis and modelling in population
genetics.

*Post doc in community ecology biodiversity monitor-
ing*
A two-year post-doctoral position is available in the
’Conservation Biology’ group at the Natural History
Museum, Paris, France.
The research project will involve the study of the spa-
tial and temporal dynamics of functional biodiversity,
using long-term community monitoring and new statis-
tical tools incorporating (functional) diﬀerences among
species. Questions of interest include: the consequences
of species loss on ecosystem functioning, the inﬂuence
of landscape and climate changes on functional diver-
sity, and the role of species life history traits on their
sensitivity to environmental changes. These questions
will be addressed using data from two monitoring pro-
grams: a long-term national survey of common birds
and a recently developed regional survey of common
ﬂowering plants.
The successful candidate will also have the opportunity
to develop independent side projects.
The proposed start date is 1 February, 2008, but is ne-
gotiable. The project is funded by the French ScienceFoundation (ANR) and funds are currently available to
support this position for up to two years.
The successful applicant will have a PhD and exten-
sive experience with community ecology and ecological
statistics or theoretical ecology. Applicants must sub-
mit (1) statement of research interest, (2) a curriculum
vitae and (3) the names and addresses of two-three ref-
erences (including e-mail and phone number) to Em-
manuelle Porcher by e-mail (porcher@mnhn.fr). Appli-
cation review will begin November 15, 2007, and will
continue until the position is ﬁlled.

Stockholm InvertebratePhylogeny
Postdoctoral research associate
A two year postdoctoral position is available to study
the phylogeny of the lower Bilateria at the Department
of Invertebrate Zoology, Swedish Museum of Natural
History, Stockholm, Sweden.
Swedish Museum of Natural History ( www.nrm.se ): We
have a strong focus on research in organismal diver-
sity and evolution where the extensive collections play
an important part. Our laboratory of molecular sys-
tematics forms a hub for phylogenetic projects dealing
with animals, fungi and plants. Scanning and trans-
mission electron microscopes are available for morpho-
logical studies. The department of Invertebrate Zool-
ogy will move into renovated and refurbished premises
in early 2008. The research division of SMNH oﬀers
a broad international working environment and con-
sists of approximately 190 scientists, postgraduate stu-
dents, administrative and technical personnel from var-
ious countries.
Project: Reconstruction of early bilaterian evolution
is the central theme for our group. The origin of Bi-
lateria is one of the most important events in animal
evolution as it led to an unparalleled explosion of di-
versity. We study the phylogeny and taxonomy of the
poorly known marine worm groups Acoela and Nemer-
todermatida, formerly classiﬁed as ﬂatworms, but now
thought to be early bilaterian clades. Comprehensive
taxonomic sampling of rDNA and mitochondrial genes
is emphasized, as well as morphological data such as
sperm ultrastructure and morphology of the nervous
system, studied with confocal microscopy. The aim is
to provide robust phylogenetic hypotheses and compre-
hensive classiﬁcations. The hypotheses will allow re-
construction of acoel and nemertodermatid ancestors
and ultimately the ancestral bilaterian. Sequencing
of mitochondrial genomes and ESTs from Nemertoder-
matida, Acoela and Gastrotricha provides a further test
of their position and data for other bilaterian phylo-
genies, e.g. determining the position of Gastrotricha
and Gnathifera without the disadvantage of distant out-
groups such as Cnidaria. This postdoctoral project will
speciﬁcally focus on reconstructing phylogeny from mi-
tochondrial genomes and low copy nuclear genes in key
acoel, nemertodermatid and gastrotrich taxa. Starting
date by agreement.Candidates: Interested candidates should have a PhD
with experience in molecular phylogenetics includ-
ing mitochondrial genome sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis of sequence data. Experience in working with
microscopic invertebrates (meiofauna) is desirable.

Toulouse AntFungusAssociations
Post-doctoral position in molecular biology: fungi and
ant/fungus associations.
An 18-month post-doctoral position is available start-
ing in January 2008 in the Evolution et Diver-
sit´ e Biologique laboratory (Toulouse, France, http://-
www.edb.ups-tlse.fr ). The position is funded by a “Je-
unes Chercheurs” grant provided through the French
government’s Agence Nationale de la Recherche. The
project is named ’Allomerus’ and aims to obtain a fully
comprehensive understanding of a novel tripartite sys-
tem between an ant species, a plant and a sooty mould.
The targeted model system is the Guianian ant-plant
Hirtella physophora, its ant associate Allomerus dece-
marticulatus and a sooty mould manipulated by the
ants to build a trap in order to capture prey (Dejean
et al., 2005, Nature 434: 973). The general objectives
include the study of (i) the nature and roles of selec-
tive ﬁlters in the observed pattern of the association
and the evolutionary ecology of this ant-plant associ-
ation; (ii) the nature of the association between the
ant and the sooty mould; and (iii) the spatial popula-
tion genetic structure of the three partners to infer the
transmission modes of these associations. Within this
general framework, the proposed post-doctoral project
will use molecular analyses to evaluate the speciﬁcity
of the ant/fungus association at both the interspeciﬁc
and intraspeciﬁc levels. The position will require the88 EvolDir November 1, 2007
researcher to (i) determine the taxonomic position of
the fungi involved by sequencing the rRNA genes and
through phylogenetic analysis; (ii) develop molecular
markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of a poten-
tially ant-manipulated fungus and (iii) evaluate the de-
pendence on the association of both partners. The ap-
plicant should have a PhD in Biology, Environmental
Sciences, Microbiology, Molecular Biology or related ar-
eas. Proﬁciency in molecular biology is required and
knowledge of fungi and/or social insects is preferred,
but not essential. Note that the position will involve
ﬁeld trips to French Guiana to collect samples and con-
duct experiments. Field experience in the tropics would
then be useful, as would a working knowledge of French.
Applicants should send a copy of their curriculum vi-
tae describing their skills and work experience, recom-
mendation letter(s) and relevant publications to Jerome
Orivel (orivel@cict.fr) before the 9th of November, 2007
or until the position is ﬁlled.

“Throw up a handful of feathers, and all must fall to
the ground according to deﬁnite laws; but how simple
is this problem compared to the action and reaction
of the innumerable plants and animals which have de-
termined, in the course of centuries, the proportional
numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old In-
dian ruins!”
This exclamation by Darwin in his famous book on the
origin of species still rings very true today: while physi-
cists have discovered laws governing the tiniest parti-
cles and the largest stellar objects, biologists are still
struggling to understand how species are formed (spe-
ciation) and how they coexist. Some have tried to ex-
plain the emergence of new species, but stopped short of
studying what this means for the biodiversity patterns
that we observe today, such as how the abundances
of species diﬀer between species, how the numbers of
species vary over spatial distances, and how the related-
ness of species varies with their abundance and spatial
location. Others have studied how such patterns are
maintained, but they did not study the processes that
formed the basic components of these patterns. This
project will be aimed at completing the full circle:
(A) With theoretical models we will study how speci-
ation gives rise to biodiversity patterns and how theseNovember 1, 2007 EvolDir 91
patterns in turn inﬂuence speciation. (B) We will con-
front the models to biodiversity data sets, (being) col-
lected in our group. In this synthetic evolutionary-
ecological framework the relative contributions to bio-
diversity in an ecological community of (1) species’
functions (traits) and interactions, of (2) the common
evolutionary history (phylogeny) of species, and of (3)
birth, death and dispersal/migration of individuals will
be identiﬁed.

UHawaii PhyloComparativeMethods
POSTDOCTORAL position in PHYLOGENETIC
COMPARATIVE METHODS
University of HawaiiI am seeking a highly motivated postdoc to work on an
NSF funded project to develop new tools for compar-
ative analysis, particularly for the purpose of studying
adaptive evolution.
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck methods for Comparative Hy-
potheses (OUCH) is aimed at providing a comprehen-
sive and explicit modeling framework within which bi-
ologists can test hypotheses of adaptive evolution for
continuous characters. The approach is based upon a
model that allows for multiple selective regimes, each
parameterized by an optimal trait value, as well as over-
all strengths of selection and drift. One can arrange se-
lective regimes arbitrarily on a phylogenetic tree. This
ﬂexibility allows hypotheses of arbitrary complexity to
be translated directly into statistical models and con-
fronted with data. We have applied information-based
model-selection techniques to rigorously compare mul-
tiple alternative hypotheses. This allows ﬁne discrimi-
nation among alternatives – alternatives that may diﬀer
only in the regimes speciﬁed on a branch of particular
interest. Because of these features, the method allows
detailed exploration of historical diﬀerences, whether
such hypotheses depend on a speciﬁc ordering of selec-
tive regimes, or a particular ecological or biogeograph-
ical association.
Project Objectives: 1) Application of OUCH to exist-
ing comparative datasets to better illustrate its ana-
lytical power and gain new insight into speciﬁc ques-
tions in evolutionary biology. 2) Deveopment of the-
ory for bivariate, multivariate, and frequency data. 3)
Development of strategies for concurrently accounting
for uncertainty in the phylogeny. 4) Investigation of
statistical properties of the methods. 5) Modules writ-
ten to port these methods into the Mesquite package.
6) Improvements to our project’s web pages. 7) Con-
tinued support and distribution of our existing open-
source software (in R) for the methods.
We are currently in the development phase of the bivari-
ate model, exploration of its properties, and application
to datasets.
Applicants should have scientiﬁc programming experi-
ence, and either knowledge of evolutionary theory or
biological modeling. Excellent communication abilities
and good interpersonal skills are necessary.
Desired Qualiﬁcations: Experience in comparative phy-
logenetic methods, programming in R.
Compensation: salary will be competitive. A student
health plan is available. Funding for one year, renew-
able for second year with suﬃcient progress.

laboration between the Universities of St Andrews &
Sheﬃeld, UK, and Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Finland. The aim of the
project is to collect ﬂies from replicate natural popula-
tions, rear pedigrees in the laboratory and use quanti-
tative trait locus techniques to examine the inheritance
of behaviours inﬂuencing sexual selection and specia-
tion. Genetic markers to be scored will include can-
didate genes and one aim of the project is to assess
any consistency of QTL positions for complex traits in
diﬀerent populations. Results will be compared with
related studies of this and other species of Drosophila.
This position is funded by an NERC award to Mike
Ritchie (St Andrews), Roger Butlin & Jon Slate

There are no nationality restrictions on applications. A
PhD in a relevant subject (evolutionary biology, quan-
titative or statistical genetics, molecular genetics, be-
haviour genetics) is essential. Main duties will involve
establishment of the pedigrees, behavioural analysis,
marker development, genotyping and quantitative ge-

UToulouse IslandBirdEvolution
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION UNIVERSITY OF
TOULOUSE
ISLAND BIRD EVOLUTION
A postdoctoral position is available immediately to
work on a possible case of incipient, within-island, spe-
ciation in a bird taxon endemic to a small island. In the
late 60s, Frank Gill conducted a very detailed study of
plumage colour and morphometric variation in the Mas-
carene Grey White-Eye (Zosterops borbonicus) popula-
tions of the island of La Reunion and found phenotypic
variation within the island that was geographically
structured with possible hybrid zones between discrete
lowland morphs and two distinct morphs occurring in
sympatry in the highlands (Gill 1973 Ornith. Monogr.
; available on SORA http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/ ).Recently, we showed that Mascarene Grey White-eyes
from La Reunion form a monophyletic group (Warren
et al. 2006 Mol. Ecol.). We have also obtained popu-
lation genetic data indicating that there is substantial
genetic diﬀerentiation among populations within the is-
land but for many nuclear markers patterns of genetic
variation do not match exactly with morphs (Mila et
al. in prep).
The project will involve expanding the number of popu-
lations surveyed and investigating patterns of morpho-
logical and genetic variation along elevational gradients
and across contact zones using a vast array of molecu-
lar markers that are already available. This will allow
for a comprehensive examination of alternative mech-
anisms causing phenotypic divergence among morphs
and across habitats and their implications in terms of
within-island speciation.
This is a collaborative project involving Christophe
Thebaud & Philip Heeb (CNRS & University of
Toulouse), Borja Mila (Museum Natural History,
Madrid), and Dominique Strasberg & Ben Warren
(University of La Reunion). The postdoctoral research
associate will be based in the Thebaud/Heeb lab in
Toulouse and will be responsible for leading 3-5 mo ﬁeld
work on the island of La Reunion (usually with other
members of the project). Most of the molecular work
will be carried out using the state-of-the-art facilities of
the Toulouse Genopole.
Candidates should have a PhD in a relevant ﬁeld that
may include evolutionary biology, animal behaviour,
quantitative genetics, etc. Strong writing skills as evi-
denced through a publication record as well as excellent
interpersonal skills are essential. Research experience
with capturing and handling small birds is required
(ideally the candidate should have a banding/ringing
permit). Ability to speak French, or willingness to learn
some basic French, is highly desirable. The position is
for 18 months in the ﬁrst instance.
Applicants should send a detailed CV, together with a
1-page statement of research interests and motivation
and the names and e-mail adresses of two references to

Course Description More than 30 years ago, Theodosius
Dobzhansky claimed:“Nothing in Biology makes sense
except in the light of evolution”: Currently, the sim-
plest Bioinformatics analysis uses species comparisons
in order to hypothesise the function of an novel bio-
logical sequence: Moreover, in most Molecular Biology
labs, evolutionary and phylogenetic concepts are con-
stantly being used with more or less formality: homol-
ogy, similarity, evolutionary rates, long branch attrac-
tion, rooted and unrooted trees, monophyletic group,
molecular clock, adaptation, lineage eﬀects, neutralism,
cladograms, phylograms, etc: The course covers these
and other major concepts in Evolutionary Biology and
Phylogenetics: Attendees will acquire speciﬁc skills in
using the methodology in Comparative and Evolution-
ary Biology problems: The course is designed to be a
mixture of theoretical and practical sessions developed
in 5 days, where both classic and recently introduced
methods for phylogenetic reconstruction will be cov-ered: As outcome of the more recent developments, the
course dedicates a day to the analysis of adaptation at
a molecular level: Phyml, Phylip, MEGA, TreePuzzle,
MrBayes, PAML, Modeltest-Protest, and the Phyle-
mon web server are some of the software resources
that will be used in the practical sessions: Elementary
knowledge of Biochemistry and Sequence Analysis is
useful though not strictly required.

Smithsonian EvolutionaryPhycology
Jul9-23
Short Course in Tropical Phycology July 9 - 23, 2008
This course is designed to orient participants to the
biodiversity of tropical marine ﬂoras through ﬁeld and
laboratory work. Speciﬁcally, it will emphasize the de-
velopment or enhancement of practical skills essential
for identiﬁcation, characterization and preservation of
tropical marine macroalgae (seaweeds). Sampling for-
ays in diverse environments (e.g., mangrove habitats,
seagrass beds, coral reefs, sponge communities) on pro-
tected and exposed shorelines throughout the Bocas del
Toro Archipelago will complement morphological and
molecular investigations in the laboratory.
Morphological investigation will emphasize the prepa-
ration of specimens for microscopic examination and
the interpretation of vegetative and reproductive struc-
tures in living material in the light of published ob-
servations from the primary literature. Participants
will contribute to the development of the Bocas del
Toro Biodiversity Inventory ( http://striweb.si.edu/-
bocas database/ ) and the development of a bi-lingual
ﬁeld guide to the local marine ﬂora through the produc-
tion of individual species pages documenting microscop-
ical and ﬁeld observations (e.g., http://striweb.si.edu/-
bocas database/details.php?id=3708 ). Molecular in-100 EvolDir November 1, 2007
vestigation will emphasize sampling and preservation
of material for subsequent analysis of DNA sequences
for barcoding, phylogenetic and biogeographical stud-
ies. Data derived from this part of the class will con-
tribute to the Bocas del Toro Barcode of Life Project.
Most ﬁeld sites can be sampled by snorkeling (0-10m
depths), but optional SCUBA diving opportunities will
be available. The course will be taught in English.

Smithsonian ShrimpTaxonomy
Aug4-16
Short Course in Shrimp Taxonomy
Shrimp Taxonomy (Caridea, Dendrobranchiata and
Stenopodidea) August 4 - 16, 2008
The course is aimed at graduate students, post-docs, or
professionals who are interested in learning and apply-
ing knowledge about the diversity and ecology of one
the most abundant and colourful inhabitants of coral
reefs. The students participating in this course will:
Learn to identify common shrimps (Caridea, Dendro-branchiata and Stenopodidea) from the mangroves and
shallow coral reefs of the Bocas del Toro region, many
of which occur in the wider Caribbean region Learn
general biological and ecological characteristics of the
group. Gain hands-on ecological and taxonomic expe-
rience with tropical marine shrimp. Learn ecological
survey and sampling techniques, as well as the vital
components of modern taxonomy (photography, DNA
extraction). This course seeks to give the participant
the necessary tools to continue studies on the taxon-
omy and /or ecology of shrimps. The course will last
12 days, and is primarily targeted at taxonomic train-
ing, including the characteristics and identiﬁcation of
the various shrimp families and genera at Bocas del
Toro, many of which will be identiﬁed to species. The
main focus will be on modern taxonomy, using ﬁeld col-
lecting, morphological work, photography and genetic
relationships. Other topics to be covered are current
classiﬁcation, the phylogenetic framework of Decapoda,
ecology, as well as lectures on aquaculture, commercial
ﬁshing and the aquarium trade. Also included will be
an independent project either of the participants choice
or in consultation with the instructors, with students
presenting their work on the ﬁnal day. Daily activities
will include: morning and afternoon lectures, a ﬁeld
trip, lab work, and discussion sections or talks.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plainNovember 1, 2007 EvolDir 101
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
