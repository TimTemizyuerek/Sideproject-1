Montpellier DiseaseEvolution
Jun11-14
Following the cancellation of the EEID 2020 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the Montpellier meeting has been
rescheduled to the 11-14 June 2021 .
Our preferred option is to maintain the spirit of pre-
vious EEID meetings, so we are doing our utmost to
maintain an in-person event. The safety and well-being
of all conference participants is our priority. The EEID
2021 organising committee will continue to monitor the
COVID-19 pandemic as the situation evolves. The re-
cent good news regarding vaccines are encouraging but
it is dicult to forsee what will be feasible next spring.
The nal decision about whether the in-person meeting
can take place will be made in early March 2021 . If
our in-person gathering has to be cancelled the event
will be converted into an online format.
Follow us on twitter @eeid2021, on our [ https:/-

Infectious-Diseases-Meeting-2021-106581460734837

We hope to see you in Montpellier in 2021. In the
meantime, take care of yourselves and stay safe!

Online HonourProfJohnAWoolliams
Jan28
Dear colleagues,
Professor John A. Woolliams is retiring after 43 years
of a distinguished career at various incarnations of to-
day's Roslin Institute. Over this period, John has been a
recognised international leader in the science of quantita-
tive genetics and its application to animal breeding. He
has made signicant contributions in several key areas,
including the development of the quantitative genetic
theory that underlies key principles of modern breeding
programs; applied research to solve practical problems
in breeding programs of livestock, companion animals
and conifers; and notably, the training and mentoring
of numerous students and scientists, many of whom are
now leaders in the eld. Lastly, he has always been a
true gentleman, patient and compassionate colleague
and mentor, yet carefully direct when needed.
It is a shame that the pandemic is preventing us from
celebrating John's career in person. Instead, we are
organising an online symposium to honour John's con-
tributions to quantitative genetics and animal breeding.
This event will take place on the 28th of January 2021
(10:30 - 16:30). You can view the programme and a
more detailed summary of John's key contributions as
well as register for the symposium at
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/symposium-in-honour-
of-professor-john-a-woolliams-tickets-129488510621
I believe many of you will want to wish John much
enjoyment in this next phase of his illustrious career.
You can reach him at john.woolliams@roslin.ed.ac.uk
On behalf of the organising committee.

Dear colleagues,
We would like to inform you that the registration dead-
line for the First Italian Congress on Marine Evolution,
EVOLMAR2020 has been extended to November 15th.
The conference is organized by the Zoological Station
Anton Dohrn, Naples (SZN) and the Italian Society
for Evolutionary Biology (SIBE-ISEB), and will take
place in an entirely virtual format on the 23rd-25th of
November 2020.
The meeting will feature a combination of invited
keynotes, contributed talks and posters around 4 the-
matic areas: macroevolution, populations and species,
adaptation, biodiversity.
We received 92 contributions from scientists in 18 dier-
ent countries, and so far over 230 people have registered
to attend the event. While abstract submission is now
closed, due to the much greater interest in the confer-
ence than we were originally expecting we have decided
to keep the registration open for one more week.
Presentations will be in English and conference par-
ticipation is open to all. Thanks to the support of
many dedicated sponsors, we have been able to keep the
registration fee to a minimum (only 10 euros).
Additional information is available on the con-
ference website (https://www.evolmar.it/); on the
Twitter (https://twitter.com/evolmar2020), Facebook
(https://www.facebook.com/EVOLMAR2020) and In-

Online MICPhylogenomics Feb15-17
Dear EvolDir Community,
We are pleased to announce that the **Mathematical,
Inferential, and Computational Phylogenomics** (MIC-
Phy) workshop will take place online from 15th to 17th
February 2021.
The MIC-Phy workshop intends to stimulate a broader
discussion on novel phylogenomic models, focusing on
the computational and statistical aspects of using large
and heterogeneous sequences to build species trees and
perform inference. We welcome submissions on recent
advances in phylogenetic method development (both
theoretical and computational), as well as key insights
into new or old data gained using novel methods.
Keynote speakers:
* Ziheng Yang (University College of London, UK)
* Tracy Heath (Iowa State University of Science and
Technology, USA)
We will hold small computer tutorials entitled **New
approaches to phylogenetic inference**. The main focus
will be polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models and
software sessions in RevBayes and IQ-TREE.
MIC-Phy is supported by the WWTF and VetMedUni
Vienna, and there is no registration fee! You can
nd more information about the workshop at https://-
mrborges23.github.io/micphy2021/ . Important dates:
* 15th January 2021: Deadline for workshop registration
and abstract submission
* 1st February 2021: Notication of oral/poster presen-
tation and workshop acceptance
* 9th February 2021: Registration and poster submission

SMBEv 2021
A Virtual Meeting to Beat All Virtual Meetings
We are in the rst stages of developing our plan for our
society' ^As annual meeting. We decided earlier in the
year that the meeting this summer will be virtual (Auck-
land is postponed until 2022). Today, we are asking our
membership for volunteers to help organize and deliver
SMBE' ^As rst (but probably not last) virtual meeting.
This is your opportunity to help shape not only this
year' ^As meeting, but future inclusive, distributed, and
carbon-friendly society meetings!
What will the virtual conference look like?
Our 2021 meeting will take advantage of a Hub model,
which will allow us to reach and engage our global com-
munity. We will have THREE geographically distributed
Hubs, one in Australia/Asia, one in Europe/Africa, and
one in US/Canada/SouthAmerica. Each Hub will co-
ordinate roughly ^A~A of the Symposia (which will be
solicited as normal), which will distribute the timing of
the symposia themselves across time zones and encour-
age as much synchronous participation as possible.
I want to help organize SMBEv2021! What role can I
play?
There are lots of ways for you to get involved! You can
volunteer to be a Hub Coordinator, a member of a Hub
Team, a Symposium Coordinator, or to help during the
conference to ensure that symposia, Q&A, and poster
sessions run smoothly.
We are now inviting proposals for Hub Coordinators
and Hub Teams. (Deadline 15 December 2021)
Hub Coordinators and Hub teams will take on a role
similar to the local conference organising committee of
in-person meetings, but without the hassle of booking
local venues! Hub teams will:
-
Collaborate with each other and with liaisons from the
SMBE council for decision-making as to online platforms
and other logistical aspects (e.g. timing of symposia and
plenary talks, planning \social" events) of SMBEv2021
-December 1, 2020 EvolDir 7
Collaborate to solicit symposia and distribute these
among Hubs -
Deliver ^A~A of the conference, including ensuring that
symposia within that Hub run smoothly, that mem-
bers behave with respect and decency, and that they,
along with all symposia organisers within their Hub,
are trained appropriately to manage any aberrant be-
haviours. -
Hub Coordinators will also be members of the scien-
tic committee that, together with Beth Shapiro, Mary
O'^AConnell, Harmit Malik (representing SMBE Coun-
cil) will select the symposia, with an aim to ensure (1)
quality of the symposia and (2) diversity of symposia
that represent our community' ^As broad demographics
and scientic interests.
Note that Hub Coordinators and Team Members cannot
also propose to organize symposia, as they will be in
charge of selecting the symposia that will be featured
at SMBEv2021. However, teams that are not chosen
to be HUB coordinators will be strongly encouraged to
participate as symposium organizers!
Symposium organisers will lead the submission of sym-
posium proposals. Selected symposia will be assigned to
a hub, which will determine the timing of the symposium
during the conference. Symposium leaders will have all
the usual responsibilities of a symposium organiser, but
without a budget. In addition, they will:
-
make sure that all talks are received ahead of time,
functioning on YouTube, and accessible -
be responsible for ensuring quality of talks and that
timing is kept precisely -
moderate discussions online for both the talks and asso-
ciated poster session
We are hoping that the call for symposia will be released
in early February.
I want to be a Hub Coordinator or Hub Team Member.
How do I apply for this awesome role?
We are currently soliciting proposals for Hubs! If you
would like to be part of a hub, please:
-
Identify a Hub Coordinator and 3-5 Hub Team members
who will work together within your geographic region. -
Check your calendars! While we don' ^At anticipate that
this will be even close to the amount of work that
it takes to organize an in-person meeting, there will
be some busy times. We will need to set aside time
in January/February for selecting symposia, and inMarch/April to select talks and posters And the confer-
ence will be held 4-8 July 2021! -
Work with the Hub Coordinator to answer the six ques-
tions below, and submit these (along with any support-
ing information) to smbe.contact@gmail.com
PLEASE SEND IN YOUR APPLICATIONS BY DE-
CEMBER 15, 2020. If you have any questions, please
reach out to us at smbe.contact@gmail.com
QUESTIONS FOR HUB TEAMS
1. Please provide your name and contact details.
2. Where in the world are you based, and what time
zones are you comfortable working in?
3. What previous experience do you have organizing
meetings or workshops? Please describe one or more
challenges that you experienced, and how you overcame
these challenges.

Title: Exploring the evolution of vertebrate early devel-
opment using single-cell genomics
The role We are seeking a highly motivated candidate
to join our teams to work on an interdisciplinary project
(experimental and computational) involving single-cell
genomics and chromatin proling in dierent chordate
species. The research program for this position focuses
on elucidating the origin and evolution of the regula-
tory programs controlling vertebrate morphogenesis and
cell dierentiation. To this end, you will apply and
analyse advanced functional genomics to characterize
cell types and regulatory genome features in vertebrate
and non-vertebrate chordate species. Specically, this
involves: (i) scRNAseq to dene cell type-specic gene
expression across multiple developmental stages, and
(ii) bulk ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to map chromatin
states and regulatory element usage. The candidate will
spearhead the analysis, integration, and interpretation
of these comparative omics datasets.
This is a strongly collaborative project and, as such,
it will involve visits to laboratories in dierent coun-
tries. Our laboratories have state-of-the-art single-cell
infrastructure and the candidate will be trained in com-
putational analysis of single-cell and chromatin data,
as well as in advanced comparative genomics and phy-
logenetics (synteny, sequence composition, gene family
evolution, etc.). Furthermore, it will be possible to
receive training and have regular access to a droplet-
based single-cell platform (Indrops, 10x), as well as our
liquid-handling robot.
The candidate will be part of a highly interdisciplinary,
international and dynamic team composed by the Sebe-
Pedros and Irimia groups, which include developmental,
computational, evolutionary and molecular biologists.
About the teams Our groups study genome regulation
from an evolutionary systems perspective. In particular,
we are interested in deciphering the evolution of animal
cell type developmental programs and the regulatory
mechanisms underlying these programs. To this end,
we apply advanced single-cell genomics and chromatin
experimental methods to molecularly dissect cell types
and epigenomic landscapes in phylogenetically diverse
organisms. We also develop computational tools to inte-
grate these diverse data sources into models of cell type
gene regulatory networks and we use phylogenetic meth-
ods to comparatively analyze these models. Our recent
work has provided the rst whole-organism cell typeatlases in dierent species and mapped key regulatory
features underlying both development and cell diversity
in non-model invertebrate organisms and the origin of
vertebrates (see \Relevant Publications" below). By
analysing the development of chordate species at single-
cell resolution, we now aim at dissecting the evolution
of vertebrate cellular ontogenies and their underlying
gene regulatory networks.

InsectEvolutionSexdetermination
Dear all,
I am looking for enthusiastic evolutionary/molecular
biologists or entomologists for a 4-year PhD position
in my lab http://lauraross.bio.ed.ac.uk at the Institute
of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh. I
advertise three possible project (see below). There
are funding options for both UK and international stu-
dents. If you are interested please contact me directly
(laura.ross@ed.ac.uk) to discuss. Deadline 6th of Jan-

ested!
1) Sexual conict in a y with unusual sexdetermina-
tion In organisms with separate sexes, sex determina-
tion is among the most important early developmental
processes for tness. Despite its importance, in many
groups of organisms sex determination is remarkably
dynamic, with the specic gene, chromosomal location,
and parent of origin of the sex determining gene showing
rapid turnover. This dynamism has been proposed to
reect conict between genes and between parents.
A clear case of conict occurs in a group of small ies,
which exhibit so-called paternal genome elimination, in
which males eliminate the genome they inherit from their
fathers. This system puts extremely strong selection on
fathers to produce daughters, since sons do not trans-
mit their genes. Theory predicts adaptation in both
sex determination mechanism in behavior. Consistent
with molecular adaptation, frequent transitions in sex
determination mechanism, with dierent chromosomes
determining sex in dierent species and some species
even exhibiting maternal sex determination, in which
some mothers have only sons, others only daughters. Be-
havioral adaptation is expected since males are expected
to evolve to prefer to mate with mothers more likely to
bear daughters, particularly in the case of maternal sex
determination.
The project involves, bioinformatic, behavioral and the-
oretical studies of this group to understand the causes
and consequences of maternal sex determination and
paternal genome elimination. At the bioinformatic level,
bioinformatic analyses of genomes and transcriptomes
of related species will illucidate the population-genetic
processes driving sex determination evolution. At the
behavioral level, studies of mating behavior will probeDecember 1, 2020 EvolDir 11
adaptations to maternal sex determination. At the the-
oretical level, there are opportunities to develop new
models to generate predictions to regarding the origins
and consequences of maternal sex determination and
paternal genome elimination.
This project will be co-supervised by Scott Roy
(San Francisco State University and there will be
opportunities for the candidate to visit his lab.) https:/-

y-with-unusual-sex-determination/?p126016 2) Sex,
males, and hermaphrodites in the scale insect Icerya
purchasi
Organisms reproduce in diverse ways. Yet it is unclear
why and how new reproductive strategies evolve. This
project focuses on the only case of hermaphroditism
in insects: In species of the scale insect Icerya female-
like hermaphrodites produce both sperm and eggs and
self-fertilize.
Understanding why there is such variability in the way
organisms reproduce is one the most important unsolved
puzzles in evolutionary biology. This project aims to
tackle this question by focusing on the unique and puz-
zling reproductive strategy of the scale insect Icerya
purchasi. This species is the only insect unequivocally
described as hermaphroditic; female-like hermaphrodites
can produce both sperm and eggs and self-fertilize. But
how can a female produce sperm? A recent hypothe-
sis suggests that the sperm present in hermaphrodites
seem to have originated from the individuals father \in-
fecting" his future ospring with sperm-producing cells.
However, although the data is suggestive, this hypoth-
esis requires further scrutiny. It is also unclear why,
while most ospring develop as hermaphrodites, a small
number develop as males. Finally, it seems that while
hermaphroditism is exceedingly rare in insects, it might
have evolved independently in several close relatives of
Icerya. This PhD project will explore how and why this
unusual reproductive system evolved by using compara-
tive methods across species as well as experimental and
genomic analyses in the laboratory. Together this work
will help us to better understand what evolutionary
forces shape the ways animals reproduce.
The projects sets out to test a number of key questions
to better understand the evolution of the only insect
hermaphrodite: 1. What is the evolutionary and devel-
opmental origin of the sperm produced by female-like
hermaphrodites? 2. Hermaphrodites can self-fertilize,
so why and how do they occasionally produce male o-
spring? 3. How frequently did hermaphroditism evolved
within the clade of

MEME Application Cohort 2021 open
Please alert your students to this great opportunity!
MEME (Erasmus Mundus Master in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy) is a two-year research oriented master program for
talented and motivated students who are interested in
understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and helpto cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four Euro-
pean universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands;
University of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,
Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA) and the University of Lausanne (Switzerland) as
associate partners. Together, this consortium has put
together an attractive multidisciplinary program that
meets the highest standards. All students have to study
at (at least) two partner universities, and they will re-
ceive a double degree from two partner universities they
have attended.
A limited number of EMJMD scholarships are avail-
able for the highest ranked students. Details on the
program and the selection procedure can be found on

MichiganStateU FishEvoDevoGeno
PhD Positions in Fish Evolutionary Developmental Ge-
nomics The Fish Evo Devo Geno Lab (PI: Ingo Braasch)
at Michigan State University is recruiting highly moti-
vated PhD students interested in working on the genomic
basis of vertebrate evolution and development to start
in Summer/Fall 2021.
The Braasch Lab focuses on genomic and developmental
changes that contribute to major transitions during the
course of vertebrate evolution and studies evolutionary
novelties at the levels of genome structure, gene family
evolution, and gene regulation. We combine sequencing
and comparative analyses of sh genomes with analy-16 EvolDir December 1, 2020
ses of molecular evolution and functional genetic and
developmental approaches (CRISPR genome editing,
transgenics, gene expression analyses, epigenomic pro-
ling) in a variety of model species (zebrash, spotted
gar, medaka, killish, and others). Graduate projects
fall within the following broader research areas of the
group: 1. Genomic and morphological evolution of shes:
How do morphological dierences among sh and other
vertebrate lineages arise from diversication of gene
repertoires? What is the role of gen(om)e duplications
and gene losses in generating phenotypic diversity? How
do changes in gene regulation contribute to evolutionary
novelties and key innovations? We study a number of
gene families that are of particular importance for the
evolution of the vertebrate body plan, e. g. genes in-
volved in development of the vertebrate-specic neural
crest cells.
2. Conquest of land and 'sh-out-of-water': We are
studying genomic changes and their functional conse-
quences leading to the evolution of tetrapods from shes
and other 'sh-out-of-water' scenarios, including the evo-
lutionary loss of genes at the water-to-land transition
and the gene regulatory basis of hatching. 3. Evolution-
ary genomic analyses of zebrash and other biomedical
sh models: Combining genomic sequence comparisons,
gene expression analyses and epigenomic proling, we
aim to improve connectivity of teleost biomedical sh
models such as zebrash, medaka, killishes, etc. to
human biology and disease.
We are highly committed to diversity and equity and to
foster an inclusive and accessible work environment.
Qualications: Applicants should hold a bachelor's de-
gree in biology, genetics, genomics, molecular biology,
bioinformatics, developmental biology, zoology or re-
lated elds. Suitable candidates should be enthusiastic
about working in an interdisciplinary manner and have
a passion for sh/vertebrate biology and evolution. Pre-
vious research experience in a relevant area is desired,
but not required.
Admission: Students will be admitted through the MSU
IBIO Graduate Program and the MSU Ecology, Evolu-
tion, and Behavior (EEB) Program. Another possible
route of admission is through the MSU Genetics and
Genome Sciences Graduate Program within the MSU
BioMolecular Science Gateway.
Application deadlines for the MSU IBIO and Genetics
Graduate Programs are December 1, 2020. Note that
GRE scores are not required for application.
Funding: Financial support is provided through research
and teaching assistantships and the PI's external fund-
ing from NSF and NIH. Competitive applicants willbe eligible for university fellowships and supported in
applying for graduate fellowships from NSF, NIH, and
other agencies.

VertebrateHybridization
Applications are invited for a 4-year PhD Research Fel-
lowship at the Natural History Museum, University of
Oslo, Norway.
The PhD project will focus on the role of hybridization
in vertebrate diversication. This role has recently seen
increasing attention as genomic studies have led to the
identication of vertebrate species produced through ho-
moploid hybridization, hybridization has been linked to
some of the most explosive adaptive radiations, and even
highly divergent species have been found to hybridize
and backcross. Beyond these case studies, however, the
role of hybridization as a potentially more general driver
of diversication remains unclear.
In this project, available and newly produced genome
data will be used to assess and characterize rates of hy-
bridization and introgression widely across vertebrates,
which will allow comparisons with speciation rates and
patterns, and thus conclusions about the general impact
of hybridization on vertebrate diversication. A partic-
ular focus will be placed on hybridization among highly
divergent taxa to determine the decline of introgression
as a function of the divergence time. The selection of
the focus groups can take into account the interests
and the background of the candidate. Participation in
eld work to sample specimens from the selected focus
groups for genome sequencing will be possible and is
encouraged.
The project will include molecular lab work in the mod-
ern DNA laboratory of the Natural History Museum,
but most of the work will be computational. In this
computational work, state-of-the art tools will be used
for population genomic and phylogenomic analyses, and
new tools may be developed. All computational work
will be performed on the powerful Norwegian Supercom-
puter facilities.
The position includes 12 months of duty work. The pur-
pose of the inclusion of duty work is to provide diverse
training in transferable skills related to research in amuseum environment. A wide range of activities can
count as duty work, including participation in eld work,
teaching, outreach, collection curation, and gardening;
the total of the duty work performed should consist of
a mix of two or more of these activities to ensure the
training of a diverse set of skills.
The candidate will be supervised by Michael Matschiner
(Associate Professor of Vertebrate Zoology) at the Nat-
ural History Museum.
The deadline for applications is 11 December 2020.

LocustPhenotypicPlasticity
Behavioral Plasticity Research Institute is looking for
12 graduate students to start Fall 2021!
Interested in pursuing a PhD or MS focused on inte-
grative animal behavior, from molecules to landscapes?
Come take a look at the Behavioral Plasticity Research
Institute (BPRI)! One of four inaugural NSF Biology
Integration Institutes, the BPRI is a virtual institute
that oers prospective graduate students stimulating
and diverse research opportunities focused on under-
standing the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plas-
ticity. Specically, the BPRI will examine locust phase
polyphenism through ten integrative research activities.
We are pleased to announce the availability of fully-
funded graduate fellowships, each with support for up
to 5 years.
Students will be primarily based in the laboratory of
their main PI, but will collaborate with other BPRI
research groups.
Participating Institutions: Arizona State University (1
PhD; Cease, Overson) Baylor College of Medicine (4
PhD; Dierick, Gabiani, Zong) Texas A&M University
(4 PhD; Behmer, Song, Sword) University of Washing-
ton at St. Louis (2 PhD; Raman) Southern Illinois
University Edwardsville (1 MS; Peterson)
Research Topic Overview: Phenotypic plasticity'Xthe
ability of a genotype to produce dierent phenotypes in
response to environmental variation'Xis observed across
all living organisms and scales of biological organiza-
tion. However, to fully understand its mechanisms,
maintenance, and evolution, complete biological inte-
gration is needed. One of the most striking examples
of coordinated phenotypic plasticity in nature is found
in locusts. Locusts comprise a handful of species in
the grasshopper family Acrididae capable of forming
dense migrating swarms through an extreme form of
density dependent phenotypic plasticity. Cryptically
colored, shy individuals (solitarious phase) can trans-
form into conspicuously colored, gregarious individuals
(gregarious phase) in response to increases in population
density. This phenomenon, referred to as locust phase
polyphenism, aects a myriad of locust traits, including
molecular biology, physiology, behavior, morphology,
and ecology. Locust swarms occur worldwide and can20 EvolDir December 1, 2020
aect the livelihood and well-being of one in ten people
on Earth. Thus, locust phase polyphenism is a powerful
comparative system for understanding how gene expres-
sion and epigenetic regulation scale up to behavioral,
physiological, and ecological interactions resulting in
outbreaks, collective movement, and mass migration,
with major food security implications. Intriguingly, the
syndrome of locust phase polyphenism has evolved mul-
tiple times within grasshoppers, with varying sets of
mechanisms contributing to phase polyphenism between
lineages. The BPRI will characterize, compare, and
integrate this phenomenon in a phylogenetic framework.
Vision Statement: The vision of the BPRI is predicated
on integration through collaboration. We recognize
the scientic and societal impacts are maximized when
groups of people with diverse backgrounds and experi-
ences come together to work towards shared goals and
the common good. This philosophy will inform all BPRI
activities.
Research Activities, plus Associated Faculty: The over-
all research goal of the BPRI is to integrate (i) suborgan-
ismal processes of locust phase polyphenism, which will
be investigated from genomic, epigenomic, transcrip-
tomic, and neurophysiological perspectives using pow-
erful genome-editing tools, with (ii) organismal biology
and ecology, which will be investigated using manipu-
lative lab-based and eld-based experiments, (iii) in a
phylogenetic framework. The BPRI aims to investigate
three locust species and three grasshopper species in
the genus Schistocerca (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that
vary in their degrees of density-dependent phenotypic
plasticity. The desert locust, S. gregaria, has been ex-
tensively researched during the last 25+ years and its
newly sequenced genome, as well as our preliminary
quantication of density-dependent phenotypic plastic-
ity of the other ve species (based on behavior and
transcriptome data) serve as a basis for formulating our
research projects.
We have 10 integrative research activities (R1-10) to
achieve our goal. In all cases we will generate data for
all six Schistocerca species:
(R1) Whole genome sequencing and assembly: Associ-
ated Faculty (Liberman Aiden, Childers, Dudchenko,
and Richards) (R2) Tissue-specic transcriptomes dur-
ing phase change: Associated Faculty (Song) (R3) Time-
resolved and tissue-specic epigenomic proling during
phase change: Associated Faculty (Zong)
Research activities R1, R2, and R3 will provide foun-
dational knowledge on the molecular basis of density-
dependent phenotypic plasticity. This information will
be used to identify key ' ^A ¥plasticity' ^A genes and
epigenetic regulation mechanisms.We will study phenotypic plasticity using a functional
genetics approach.

Project Description: Background The size and shape of
male genitalia are remarkably diverse in animals with in-
ternal fertilization and this phenomenon is long thought
to be driven by sexual selection. Changes in genital
morphology could impact reproductive success by di-
rectly changing the function of the evolved organ and/or
through behavioural modication of either or both sexes,
for example through eects on female choice. However,
causal links between morphological and behavioural
changes have been dicult to establish because these
components have often been addressed separately from
a genetic, developmental and neural perspective.
Aims This project aims to determine how genes known
to contribute to the divergence in male genitalia be-
tween two closely related species, Drosophila simulans
and Drosophila mauritiana, aect genital coupling, mat-
ing behaviour and reproductive success in these species.December 1, 2020 EvolDir 21
To obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms
driving behavioural changes we will also conduct genetic
screens to identify CNS neurons that are able to modu-
late the mating choices of both males and females as a
response to the changes in the morphology of the male
genitalia.
The results of this project will provide unprecedented
insights into the mechanisms through which morpho-
logical changes aect behavioural phenotypes and the
evolution of reproductive isolation between species and
speciation more generally.
Training Training will be provided in genomic engineer-
ing using CRISPR/Cas9, Molecular biology, Drosophila
genetics, Behavioural assays, Bioimaging, Optogenetics,
Thermogenetics, Neurogenetics and neural circuit bash-
ing using the state-of-the-art facilities available Oxford

Title: Are species boundaries adaptive? Linking specia-
tion with contemporary evolution.
Supervisor: Prof Tim Barraclough
All organisms live in diverse communities with hundreds
of other species. Understanding what species are, where
they come from, and how they interact is therefore vital
for predicting how living systems will evolve in response
to contemporary changes. You will join a group using
a wide range of approaches 'V genomics, experimental
evolution with bacteria, and long-term time-series of
wild communities 'V to tackle these challenges in a range
of animal, microbial and plant systems. Designed to
blend your interests with the group' ^As expertise, your
project will build new theory, methods and/or evidence
for understanding the dynamics of evolution of diverse
systems, ranging from speciation and origins to contem-
porary evolution and management. Previous students
have often worked with organisations such as CABI and
the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and several have con-
ducted eldwork in the UK and in Africa, South East
Asia and the American tropics.
The project will investigate whether species boundaries
are adaptive. You will test whether mechanisms for
controlling gene ow between populations evolve to opti-
mise tness in uctuating environments. You will choose
either a wild or lab system linked to existing projects. In
the wild, you could develop new approaches for tracking
eco-evolutionary dynamics from genomic time-series of
whole communities, with the aim of monitoring, predict-

How can we build resilience for benecial organisms
while reducing impacts of harmful ones? You would
generate and analyse data on fungal and insect commu-
nities associated with agricultural crops in collaboration
with non-academic partners. In the lab, you could test
these ideas with experimental evolution and speciation
with bacteria. For example, do barriers to gene transfer
evolve dierently in static versus uctuating environ-
ments. You could design bacteria with dierent kinds of
barriers to gene transfer and investigate the eects on
subsequent adaptation to uniform, divergent and uc-
tuating selection. Results could prove extremely useful,
for example, in bio-engineering systems that either do22 EvolDir December 1, 2020

NERC DTP PhD project -|Ecological drivers and
conservation implications of parental care diversity in

evolution of parental care diversity Lead Supervisor:
Dr Isabella Capellini (Queen's University Belfast)|
Co-Supervisor: Dr Greta Bocedi & Dr Lesley Lan-
caster (University of Aberdeen), Dr Domhnall Jennings
(Queen's University Belfast)
There are astonishing dierences in whether, how, and
how long for, animals care for their ospring. In most
species, such as many marine shes, parents abandon
their fertilized eggs to their own destiny, which is mostly
being eaten by predators. Conversely, parents of other
species provide protection and resources to their o-
spring. While parental care increases ospring survival,
it also comes at considerable costs for the parents be-
cause resources and time are limited. Once evolved, not
only does care aect the tness of parents and ospring,
but it also alters life history strategies, is related to
sexual selection and mating system, leads to coopera-
tion and conict within the family, and promotes the
evolution of sociality. Yet, we know very little about
when care evolves and its knock-on eects on species re-
production, population dynamics and extinction risk.|
Following our successful approach focusing on diversity
in parental care [1,2],|this project combines state-of-the-art phylogenetic comparative approaches, datasets
of parental care behaviours for hundreds of vertebrate
species, and cutting-edge evolutionary modelling, to:|
(i)|||||||||Investigate which ecological con-
ditions promote the evolution of care diversity;
(ii)||||||||Unravel how reproductive traits
co-evolve with dierent care forms;
(iii)||||||||Evaluate how care diversity inu-
ences population trends and extinction risk.|
The student will have the opportunity to shape the
project by deciding the extent of theoretical modelling
vs empirical analyses; selecting the model groups; ex-
panding or reducing the components as best suited to
their interests.
The student will be trained on data collection, data man-
agement, numeracy, statistical analyses, specically:
i.||||||||||Assemble accurate datasets on
parental care diversity, ecological and reproductive
traits, population trends and extinction risk for hun-
dreds of species, using published data;
ii.||||||||||Test theoretical predictions
with phylogenetic comparative approaches in R and

iii.|||||||||Derive quantitative predictions
with evolutionary modelling to guide the empirical
analyses.| |Full project description:| https://-

StAndrews.NewCaledonianCrow.PhD
PHD STUDENTSHIP: TOOL CRAFTING IN NEW
CALEDONIAN CROWS
DEADLINE
13 December 2020
SUMMARY
New Caledonian crows are renowned for their ability to
manufacture complex foraging tools from plant materi-
als. For example, using an elaborate sequence of actions,
they craft hooked stick tools from branching vegetation,
and employing a completely dierent technique, they
cut a variety of tool shapes from the barbed edges of
screw-pine leaves. Professor Christian Rutz's research
group has been studying the behavioural ecology of New
Caledonian crows since 2005, focussing on seven estab-
lished study sites, including some with marked crow
populations. Building on some of the group's recent
advances, this PhD project will provide a detailed inves-
tigation of the tool-manufacture behaviour of wild crows.
There is considerable exibility with regards to specic
study objectives, but the successful candidate is likely
to conduct both eld observations and aviary-based
experiments with temporarily-captive subjects, with
excellent scope for collaboration with other group mem-
bers and external project partners. This fully-funded
PhD project oers exciting opportunities for a highly
motivated student to join a dynamic research group, to
conduct topical research on the behavioural ecology of
one of the most accomplished non-human tool users, and
to receive training in state-of-the-art eld-ornithological
research methodologies.December 1, 2020 EvolDir 25

StockholmU EvolutionaryEcology
PhD student position in Evolutionary Ecology at the
Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, Sweden
Closing date: December 15, 2020
We are inviting applications for a four-year, fully-funded,
Ph.D. position in the research group of Karl Gotthardthat is focusing on the evolution of life history and plas-
ticity in seasonal environments, using primarily natural
populations of butteries as model organisms.
The new PhD student will work within the project \Evo-
lutionary ecology of life cycle regulation" and will focus
on the evolution of life cycle timing in situations where
insect species show shifts in the number of annual gen-
erations, i.e. when there are shifts in voltinism. The
phenomenon of voltinism shifts is relatively common
in insects and means that a given species shifts from
having two full generations per year in southern or low
altitude locations, to have only one annual generation in
northern or high altitude locations. Selection is likely to
change signicantly across voltinism shifts as they lead
to a dramatic change in optimal life history strategy.
The project aims at testing the general prediction from
life history theory that there are phenotypic and genetic
footprints of selection for a change in life cycle regulation
in these situations. In particular the new project aims
at exploring Ecological genetics and genomics of sea-
sonal life cycle regulation and will explore the genomic
background and genetic architecture of adaptations for
seasonal plasticity across several dierent points of the
life cycle. Moreover, we will aim to test tness eects of
this genetic variation in both eld and laboratory experi-
ments. In this way the project will provide novel insights
into ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate
change on traits that are central for the persistence of
natural populations.
The project will contain aspects of both eld and labo-
ratory work to study the ecology, genetics and genomics
of life cycle timing in several species of temperate but-
teries. The prospective student will sample replicated
populations and do controlled laboratory studies of how
phenotypic adaptations and associated genetic variation
is changing across shifts in voltinism.
The genetics will be studied by quantitative genetic
methods, selection experiments as well as functional
genomics, including the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to ma-
nipulate already established candidate genes. Finally,
we plan to do use reciprocal transplant experiments in
outdoor cages to test the adaptive signicance of local
dierence in these adaptations.
We are looking for candidates with a strong interest in
evolutionary ecology, genetics and life history theory,
with excellent analytical ability and experience with
quantitative analyses of life history traits and genetics.
Experience in working with insects in the lab and in
the eld, as well as having a valid drivers license, is
especially meriting.

Applications are invited for a competitively funded PhD
position (Evolutionary Biology) in the School of Biolog-

2021.
Immune systems are inuenced by environmental con-
ditions and in turn pathogenic landscapes vary across
geographic regions. There is a need to better under-
stand the selective landscape of immune genes because
this provides important information about adaptive ge-
netic variation that is especially relevant in the face of
a changing climate. Selection for diversity in immune
genes may also vary among wild and captive populations
since environmental conditions and pathogen exposure
dier among them, but little work has been dedicated
to investigating this. Farmed salmonids dominate the
aquaculture industry in the UK (worth over pounds 1
billion), while their wild counterparts play a vital eco-
logical role as keystone species in aquatic ecosystems,
making this an ideal system for investigating the eects
of environment and domestication on immunity. With
environmental change driving salmonid declines across
the globe, understanding how selection shapes the im-December 1, 2020 EvolDir 29
mune repertoire of this group is of critical importance.
This PhD will examine immune gene diversity in wild
and captive salmonid populations to determine the ef-
fects of environment and domestication on genes in-
volved in immune function and defence to pathogens,
with a focus on Arctic Charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and At-
lantic Salmon (Salmo salar). There is also the potential
to examine links between life history and immune gene
diversity since wild salmonids have both migratory and
non-migratory ecotypes. Given the broad phylogenetic
and environmental diversity across this system, there is
strong potential for comparative research. The major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) is an ideal candidate
for this work since variation at these genes is shaped
by both historical and ongoing selection. The results
of the project will inform wild and farmed population
management and sustainable genetic improvement in
salmonid aquaculture.
The project will be supervised by Dr. Kara Layton
and Prof. Samuel Martin (Scottish Fish immunology
Research Centre) in the School of Biological Sciences,
University of Aberdeen and by Prof. Ross Houston at
the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh. A large
collection of samples and data are already available for
this work but there may be an opportunity for the stu-
dent to collect additional samples through eld work in
the UK, Europe and Canada, expanding both the taxo-
nomic and geographic scope of this work. The student
will gain skills in molecular data generation and analy-
sis, bioinformatics, science communication and writing,
among other transferrable skills.
Candidates should have (or expect to achieve) a mini-
mum of a 2:1 UK Honours degree, or the equivalent qual-
ications gained outside the UK, in a relevant subject.
This position is open to both domestic and international
students.

position (Marine Molecular Biology) in the School of
Biological Sciences at the University of Aberdeen to
start October 2021.
Coastal ecosystems play a key role in combating the cli-
mate crisis by storing and sequestering carbon, but many
of these blue carbon ecosystems face ongoing threats
from environmental change and human activities. Main-
taining biological diversity in these habitats is essential
for proper carbon cycling but many marine taxa that
contribute to this process remain undocumented. Ma-
rine invertebrates play an especially important role inlong-term carbon storage because many produce cal-
careous shells, but genetic data is lacking for well over
50% of the marine invertebrate fauna in the UK.
The rst step in increasing our knowledge and protecting
blue carbon habitats is to document and monitor biodi-
versity. Molecular methods for monitoring biodiversity
(i.e. metabarcoding) have been shown to be more e-
cient than traditional monitoring approaches, but only
when used alongside a complete reference database. As
such, the lack of a reference database for taxa inhabiting
blue carbon ecosystems across the UK limits our ability
to protect these habitats.
You will help address these knowledge gaps by estab-
lishing a marine invertebrate DNA barcode reference
library for priority blue carbon habitats in the UK and
testing environmental DNA methods to support the
future monitoring of these vulnerable habitats.
Specically, you will: Synthesize our current under-
standing of the role of marine invertebrates in carbon

Title: Evolution and consequences of mating systems for
range dynamics and species' responses to environmental
changes.
Supervisors: Dr Greta Bocedi (www.gretabocedi.com ),
Dr Isabella Capellini and Dr Lesley Lancaster
Application Deadline: 18 January 2021
Project description: Understanding the ecological and
evolutionary processes that shape species' geographic
ranges and aect their dynamics such as expansions,
contractions and shifts, is of fundamental importance to30 EvolDir December 1, 2020
understand, predict and manage species' responses to
ongoing global environmental changes. Many challenges
that biodiversity is facing, including climate change,
habitat fragmentation and invasions, involve changes
in species' geographic ranges. Conservation biologists
are therefore increasingly faced with the tasks of either
facilitating or hinder these dynamics.
Fundamental to species' range dynamics are traits and
processes aecting species' reproductive success and ge-
netic diversity. The mating system, dened as suite
of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits
involved in obtaining and choosing mates, is key. As one
of the main driver of gene ow, together with disper-
sal, it is crucial in determining a species' evolutionary
potential by inuencing maintenance of genetic varia-
tion and individuals' tness variation. However, we still
know very little, especially for animals, about how mat-
ing system and the associated fundamental processes
of inbreeding and sexual selection: a) evolves during
environmental change, b) varies across species' ranges
and c) aects species' range dynamics and persistence
during environmental changes.
This project has two main broad objectives:
understanding how mating systems evolve during range
expansions and shifts; understanding the consequences
of mating systems ecology and evolution for range dy-
namics such as expansions, invasions and shifts. These
two fundamental questions will be addressed on two
main fronts. First, by generating new eco-evolutionary
theory through the development of genetically-explicit
models for mating system evolution (e.g.1) coupled with
spatially-explicit range dynamic models that integrate
population dynamics and dispersal (e.g.2). These mod-
els will allow generating theoretical predictions on how
the spatial processes of expansion and shifting, together
with dierent ecological and environmental conditions
(e.g. dierent rates of climate change or degrees of habi-
tat fragmentation), impact on the evolution of traits
such as mate choice, inbreeding avoidance or tolerance,
number of mates. They will further allow asking how
changes in mating system feed-back to maintenance of
genetic diversity, evolutionary potential, population vi-
ability and invasion success. Second, hypothesis and
theoretical model predictions will be tested through
large scale phylogenetic comparative analyses (e.g.3)
that will leverage global datasets of animal (e.g. mam-
mals, birds, freshwater sh and insects) life-history and
behaviours, invasions and climate-driven range-shifts.
It will be possible to investigate changes in the mating
system by, for example, using data from populations at
the core vs expanding edge of the range, or by compar-
ing native vs alien spreading populations of the same
species. Another potential question would be askinghow dierent mating systems, across taxa, might aect
expansion success.
Depending on the student interests there will be the pos-
sibility of establishing a eld system to empirically test
how mating system traits change during range shifts,
by sampling across the rapidly shifting northern range
margin of the female-polymorphic damsely Ischnura el-
egans, and conducting behavioural observations, mating
trials and paternity analyses (using genetic approaches)
to assess mating system shifts. Evidence already exist
of changes in sex ratio and patterns of sexual selection
and sexual conicts at the expanding range front.
The project is deliberately broad, leaving plenty of scope
for the student to develop their own line of research. For
example, we decided to focus on animals, but plants are
not excluded a-priori as the same questions apply. The
student interests will determine the balance between
theoretical modelling, data analyses and eld work. The
student will work closely with the PIs and receive excel-
lent training in cutting-edge eco-evolutionary modelling,
data collection and management of large datasets, and
phylogenetic comparative approaches in R. The student
will further benet from the presence of strong groups
in the department working on related topics with a
spatially- and genetically-explicit theoretical and mod-
elling approach, and from being embedded in a strong

1.ANIMAL-PLANT SYMBIOSES IN PEST INSECTS.
Supervisors: Tracey Chapman and Philip Leftwich UEA
Biological Sciences
Sequencing technologies have fueled a rapid rise in de-
scriptions of microbial communities associated with
hosts, but what is often harder to ascertain is the evo-
lutionary signicance of these symbioses. In recent
research we found that mixed modes of microbial trans-
mission play an underappreciated role in the establish-
ment of animal host-microbe relationships. The goal
of this project is to test this idea empirically and thus
dene fundamental rules governing such associations.

DIET AND LIFESPAN
Supervisors: Tracey Chapman, Wilfried Haerty and
Alex Maklakov
UEA Biological Sciences and The Earlham Institute
The key question addressed in this project is to deter-
mine why each sex typically has a dierent length of
life.
Males and females possess distinct morphological, phys-
iological and behavioural characteristics, of which dif-
ferences in lifespan are among the most striking, but
perhaps the least well understood. Length of life can
also be extraordinarily plastic 'V varying signicantly

ever, the extent to which lifespan is plastic in each sex
also diers markedly. For example, sex dierences in
male vs female lifespan in fruities can be completely
reversed by manipulations of diet and mating status via
dramatic eects on females.
The main aim of the project is to test the idea that dif-
ferences in male and female lifespan arise because each
sex chooses and require dierent nutrients to maximise
their lifespan and tness. The student will test this
using the latest experimental and bioinformatic tools in
the fruity system.

PhD Positions available at the Institute of Evolutionary
Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK
1) Dissecting the causes of reproductive mode variation
in the plant Mimulus guttatus Supervisors: Matthew
Harteld, Mario Vallejo-Marin (University of Stirling).
Perennial plants exhibit a wide variety of reproductive
modes, from exclusively sexual reproduction through
seeds, to relying almost entirely on asexual propagation.
Various theories exist to explain the evolutionary and
ecological advantages of these reproductive modes, but
testing theories can be hampered by a lack of empirical
data. The facultative sexual plant Mimulus guttatus
(yellow monkeyower) is an exciting model system for in-
vestigating the evolution of dierent reproductive modes,
as there is a large amount of variation in the relative
contribution of sexual and asexual reproduction, with
populations spanning dierent environments and eco-
logical niches. By investigating genetic diversity across
populations and linking it to the local reproductive
mode across environments, we can ask: are dierent
modes (sex or asex) associated with specic ecogeo-
graphic regions? To what extent is the reproductive
mode aected by local ecological conditions, compared
to large environmental factors such as climate? How
does reproductive mode (sex, asex) and mating'Vsystem
(selng, outcrossing) interact?
The PhD project will use UK populations of Mimulus
guttatus as a model system for investigating the evolu-
tion of reproductive modes, and how they interact withthe mechanisms of natural selection. The student will
generate new genomic data from previously'Vcollected
samples to quantify the extent of self-fertilisation and
clonal reproduction in natural populations. These data
will allow us to investigate how the evolutionary history
diers between regions exhibiting dierent reproductive
modes. The project will put the student at the fore-
front of developing an exciting new model system for
evolutionary genetics study.

2) What maintains genetic diversity in self'Vfertilising
nematodes? Supervisors: Matthew Harteld, Simon
Martin, Alex Twyford.
Many species in nature are capable of self'Vfertilisation,
where individuals create both male and female gametes
that can fuse during reproduction. Although commonly
associated with plants, it is also present in a number
of animal species. It is expected that self'Vfertilising
species harbour less genetic diversity than related out-
crossing species, due to a lack of genome mixing with
other parents. However, emerging genome data from
three self'Vfertilising species of Caenorhabditis nema-
todes (C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C. tropicalis) have
found punctuated regions that harbour surprisingly ex-
tensive genetic diversity. Various hypotheses have been
proposed for why this diversity exists, including popula-
tion admixture and balancing selection. These ndings
call for more extensive theoretical models to be devel-
oped, to fully test what is the likeliest cause of these
elevated regions of diversity.
This project will rst involve the creation of new math-
ematical models to determine what processes can main-
tain diversity in self'Vfertilising species, and over what
time frame these processes hold. These models will then
be compared to Caenorhabditis genome data to test
theoretical predictions. This project will provide the
student with important mathematical, statistical, and
genomics skills that are prevalent in modern biology
research, and will shed light on what forces inuence
the evolution of dierent reproductive modes.

tribution of sexual and asexual reproduction, with pop-
ulations spanning dierent environments and ecological
niches. By investigating genetic diversity across popula-
tions and linking it to the local reproductive mode across
environments, we can ask: are dierent modes (sex or
asex) associated with specic ecogeographic regions? To
what extent is the reproductive mode aected by local
ecological conditions, compared to large environmental
factors such as climate? How does reproductive mode
(sex, asex) and mating >1

interact?
The PhD project will use UK populations of Mimu-
lus guttatus as a model system for investigating the
evolution of reproductive modes, and how they inter-
act with the mechanisms of natural selection. The
student will generate new genomic data from previ-
ously >1
2Vcollected samples to quantify the extent of
self-fertilisation and clonal reproduction in natural pop-ulations. These data will allow us to investigate how the
evolutionary history diers between regions exhibiting
dierent reproductive modes. The project will put the
student at the forefront of developing an exciting new
model system for evolutionary genetics study.

climate/ Deadline: 5 Jan 2021 Eligibility: UK, EU

https://panorama-dtp.ac.uk/how-to-apply/ Funding:
UK (NERC, Competition-funded)
A fully funded PhD position is now open for applications
at the Universities of Hull and Leeds, UK, via NERC's
Panorama Doctoral Tranining Partnership programme.
Bees, our foremost pollinators, are vital for ecosystem
stability and global food security 'V providing polli-
nation services worth hundreds of billions of pounds
annually. The UK is home to ~245 species of wild
bees which collectively perform more pollination than
managed honeybees and bumblebees. Unfortunately,
wild bee populations are declining, under pressure from
multiple causes 'V one key factor being nutrition.
All bees feed ospring with pollen gathered from the
landscape. But human inuences such as agricultural
intensication are altering nutritional landscapes for
bees [3,4], and fundamentally aecting gene expression,
growth and reproduction. Most of what we know about
bee nutrition comes from studies in social bees like hon-
eybees or bumblebees [5,6], where nutrition inuences
caste determination, development, pathogen resistance
and others. However, the nutritional ecology of other
bees, particularly solitary bees, is largely unstudied.
Human activity is also changing climates and raising
average temperatures. Temperature aects animals' ^A
metabolic rate, physiology, digestion, and nutrient as-
similation, as well as gene expression. Dr Gilbert' ^As
recent work [7] has identied the need to store enough
carbohydrate and fat to survive the winter as potentially
critical for solitary bees' ^A nutritional ecology. But we
know little about how this is regulated, how climate
change will aect bees, and how bees will deal with
changing nutritional landscapes in a future lled with
uncertainty.We are now, for the rst time, in a position to under-
stand not just whether but also how dierent nutritional
landscapes and climates aect bees. This exciting cross-
institutional project combines eld ecology with cutting
edge molecular approaches to address a crucial knowl-
edge gap about how bees are being aected by human-
altered nutritional landscapes. This project addresses
issues relevant for pure ecological science, conservation
biology, agriculture and crop science.
At Hull, Dr Gilbert' ^As lab has pioneered rearing pro-
tocols for the economically and ecologically important
solitary bee, Osmia bicornis. This work is providing an
unprecedented window onto bee nutritional ecology. At
Leeds, Dr Duncan' ^As lab uses a variety of cutting-edge
molecular tools to understand how bees are inuenced
by their environment. Dr Duncan has conducted ground-
breaking work on how nutrition aects gene expression
in developing bees, as well as recent work on the en-
vironmental and molecular control of reproduction in
O. bicornis. The student will capitalise on this timely
opportunity to synthesize the research interests of these
two research groups and create collaborative links be-
tween institutions. The candidate will be integrated into
both lab groups and will benet from the infrastructure
and connections at both universities.
Using careful manipulations within controlled labora-
tory environments, the student will rst establish how
dietary macronutrients aect the tness of solitary bee
larvae in response to changes in rearing temperature.
Then, they will use high-throughput sequencing tech-
nology to examine genome-wide expression proles of
larvae receiving dierent diet and temperature treat-
ments, to understand the molecular and physiological
mechanisms underlying bees' ^A responses to landscape
and climate change. Nutritional cues are known to alter
gene expression [8], but to date studies have focussed
largely on a few genes, and only in honeybees. The
student will compare larvae receiving dierent treat-
ments in (1) choices larvae make about which nutrients
to consume, (2) correlates of tness such as body size
and overwinter survival, and (3) expression of growth-
versus diapause-related genes.
Outcomes: The ndings will, rstly, shed light on the
optimal nutrition for bees 'V both currently, and in a
warmer future. They will help inform active measures
such as wildower strips to conserve and promote these
vital pollinators as the climate changes. Secondly, re-
sults will also show the physiological eects of dierent

UIdaho ComparativeGenomics
Ph.D. Positions in Comparative Genomics
The Jones Lab at the University of Idaho is recruiting
at least two Ph.D. students to study the comparative
genomics of seahorses, pipeshes and seadragons (to
start Fall 2021). The students will participate in two
major NSF-funded research initiatives. The rst is to
use comparative genomics and population genomics to
investigate genome-level eects of sexual selection. The
second is to investigate the evolutionary developmental
biology of the male's brood pouch and how its evolu-
tion shapes the male-pregnancy microbiome. This latter
project is a collaboration between the Jones Lab and the
Cresko Lab at the University of Oregon. Both projects
will involve international eld work, molecular bench
work, and bioinformatics.
The University of Idaho is particularly strong in evo-
lutionary biology and bioinformatics. In addition, it
is located less than ten miles from Washington State
University, which is home to another excellent group of
evolutionary biologists. Scientists from the two univer-
sities collaborate and interact extensively.
The University of Idaho is located in Moscow, Idaho,
which is a small college town situated in the Palouse
region of Washington and Idaho. Moscow is known for
its quaint downtown and its summer farmer's market.
Thanks to its compact size, everything in Moscow is
within walking or biking distance. In addition, Moscow's
location on the Idaho-Washington border puts it within
easy reach of abundant outdoor recreational opportuni-

Evolution of Invasive Symbioses of Wood-Boring Beetles
Two graduate research assistantships are available at
the Ph.D. level to investigate the evolution of microbes
associated with invasive beetles (the emerald ash borer
(Agrilus planipennis) and the red turpentine beetle (Den-
droctonus valens). This NSF funded project will focus
on the taxonomic, functional, and genetic biodiversity of
microbes associated with these insects and their role in
the invasive process in the U.S. and China, respectively.
The overall goals of the project are to understand how
microbial communities and their functions may evolve
during biological invasions to aid the invasiveness of
wood-boring beetles. The project will characterize the
microbiomes associated with these beetles using both
culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches,
investigate potential functions of microbial associates
using laboratory, greenhouse, and eld experiments, and
characterize the genetic mechanisms of evolution within
fungal genomes that contribute novel metabolic adapta-
tions to their beetle hosts. One graduate assistantship
will concentrate on sequencing microbes that may func-
tion in degrading lignocellulose, detoxifying plant de-
fense compounds, or facilitating pathogenesis on trees,
while the other will investigate entomopathogenic fungiDecember 1, 2020 EvolDir 41

The ecological and evolutionary signicance of functional
variation in mitochondria in three-spined stickleback.
NERC-funded Envision DTP studentship, based at the
University of Nottingham in collaboration with Ban-
gor University. Provides a tax-free stipend (15,285 in
2020/21) for 3.5 years, and UK university fees.
In this multidisciplinary, international project you will
address novel and exciting questions about the ecological
and evolutionary consequences of mitochondrial varia-
tion in wild animals. You will combine ecological eld-
work, sh-keeping and behavioural experiments with
cutting-edge bioinformatics and physiological assays to
examine dierences between three-spined stickleback
sh with dierent mitochondrial genetics. Ecological
eldwork will take place in the Scottish Outer Hebrides,
and there will be opportunities for visits to collaborating
labs in Germany and Canada.
Mitochondria, the powerhouse of complex life, are
present in all cells of eukaryotes. They are unusual
because they carry a complement of their own DNA,
separate from the nucleus, which is inherited mater-nally. For many years it has been believed that the
substantial variation in mitochondrial DNA between
populations is neutral. More recently, in stark contrast,
it has been suggested that mitochondrial variation may
be fundamentally important for adaptation to environ-
mental change, given that mitochondria contain perhaps
the most critically important machinery of complex life,
which converts nutrients into available energy. However,
we know almost nothing about the functional conse-
quences of mitochondrial variation in wild organisms,
or its ecological and evolutionary signicance.
The project will be based in the MacColl
lab at the University of Nottingham, http://-
ecology.nottingham.ac.uk/AndrewMacColl/index.php,
a friendly, dynamic and well-funded group, embedded
in a wider cohesive group of ecologists and evolutionary
biologists http://ecology.nottingham.ac.uk/index.html
. Applicants should have an interest in evolutionary
biology, ecology, genetics, physiology and/or behaviour.
They should hold a minimum of a UK Honours degree
at 2.1 or equivalent in a biological or environmental
subject. Candidates with additional (e.g. Masters) qual-
ications will be looked on favourably. A driving licence,
experience of remote eldwork and SCUBA/snorkelling
would be valuable. Funding for international students
*may* be possible.

Plymouth)
Project Background
Many pollinator species, recognised as essential for
ecosystem function, are undergoing rapid declines. One
recent exception is the Tree Bumblebee' Bombus hy-
ponorum: expanding its range into and across the UK
in<20 years, it is now one of our most common species.
Building on previous work from the supervisory team,
and in collaboration with the Earlham Institute, this
project will investigate key genomic dierences between
this and other bumblebee (Bombus) species to substan-
tially improve our understanding of the factors con-
tributing to its success, along with the declines of others.
While focused on one taxonomic group, the project has
much broader relevance in understanding organismal
responses to environmental change.
The project's focus is a genomic comparison of Bombus
species from within the UK and continental Europe.
Initial work has identied genomic regions of interest
in B. hypnorum that may be indicative of an enhanced
ability to adapt to anthropogenically altered landscapes.
However, current data are preliminary and lack essential
phylogenetic comparison.
This is an exciting opportunity to generate a substantial
and highly novel genomic dataset to test hypotheses as
to whether the observed genomic dierences are unique
to B. hypnorum, or shared among Bombus species (some
evidence suggests elevated resilience in the wider Py-
robombus sub-genus). In addition to fullling the spe-cic aims, the data generated will oer the candidate
signicant scope to guide the project's further direc-
tion through characterisation of genomic signatures and
dierences across this important group.
Training
The project will equip the successful candidate with
state-of-the-art genomic techniques as well as bioinfor-
matic and modelling skills that are highly transferable
and increasingly essential across a wide range of aca-
demic and applied biological disciplines. Full training
will be provided by the supervisory team. The candidate
will also gain important soft skills (e.g. communication,
team working, problem solving). He/she will be based
in Plymouth, spending short periods at partner Institu-
tions as relevant.
Person Specication
The successful candidate will have a biology-based
degree, an academic interest in evolutionary ecology,
and be enthusiastic about pursuing a laboratory- and
computer-based project. Ideally, he/she will have some
basic molecular ecology experience (e.g. DNA extrac-
tion, PCR) and knowledge of, and interest in, genetic
and evolutionary analysis. Experience of genomic se-
quencing and bioinformatics is not essential, although ex-
perience/interest in programming (e.g. Python) would
be an additional benet.

PhD: Mating signals and avian speciation
We invite applications from excited and enthusiastic
students for a PhD position in Dr Chris Cooney's re-
search group (https://www.christophercooney.co.uk/)
in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the
University of Sheeld (https://www.sheeld.ac.uk/-

| THE ROLE OF MATING SIGNAL EVOLUTION IN
AVIAN SPECIATION |
PROJECT SUMMARY:
Explaining the diversity of life is among the greatest
challenges in biology. A particularly dazzling component
of this diversity concerns the spectacular array of animal
mating signals found in nature. Such traits (e.g. colour
patterns, songs) play a key role in reproductive processes
including mate choice and species recognition, and evo-
lutionary divergence in signalling traits has long been
recognised as a powerful mechanism for triggering repro-
ductive isolation and speciation. However, important
questions concerning the role of mating signal evolution
in determining large-scale patterns of speciation and
species richness have never been thoroughly addressed.
Focusing on the global radiation of birds ( >10,000
species), this project will combine new, high resolu-
tion datasets of plumage colouration and song structure
for thousands of bird species with cutting-edge phyloge-
netic comparative methods to answer three unresolved
questions at the core of speciation research:
I. How and why do mating signals diverge? II. What is
the role of mating signal divergence in speciation? III.
How does mating signal evolution inuence the build-up
and maintenance of species richness?The successful applicant will become familiar with the
use of natural history museum collections for data col-
lection and will acquire advanced computer and com-
munication skills that are highly transferable. Addi-
tionally, there will be ample opportunity for the stu-
dent to develop and pursue their own research interests
over the course of the project, in collaboration with co-
supervisors Dr Gavin Thomas and Prof Ben Hatchwell.

3 PhD positions to study cooperation in common mar-
mosets and vervet monkeys, starting date 01.04.2021
The positions are linked to a collaboration between
Carel van Schaik, Judith Burkart (both University of
Zurich) and Redouan Bshary (University of Neuch^ atel).
One position is nanced by the University of Neuch^ atel,
the other two by a 4-year grant from the Swiss Science
Foundation, which also covers all eld and lab work.
The title of the grant is \Acts of Assistance: Solving
the riddle of stable cooperation among non-relatives in
nonhuman primates". The aim is to test experimentally
'shared stake models' and 'competitive altruism mod-
els' on two monkey species with rather dierent social
systems. The rst thesis will focus on wild and captive
marmosets (based in Zurich), the second on wild vervet
monkeys, and the third one will link social behavior and
physiological correlates in both species (latter two based
in Neuch^ atel).
We seek highly motivated team players who are inter-
ested in proximate and ultimate aspects of cooperation.
Applicants need a master degree in Biology or equiva-
lent. Other criteria for our choices will be a candidate's
knowledge of animal behavior, evolutionary theory, pre-
vious eld research experience, publication record, and
(for the 3rd position) skills in physiology.
The application needs to contain copies of certicates,
a full CV, the names of 3 potential referees (no need
for reference letters at this stage!), and a letter of mo-
tivation (2 pages max) that should include your view
on animal cooperation. You can specify a preference
for one of the three PhD topics but this point will belargely claried during interviews.
Time line: please submit your application until 7.12.2020
to Carel van Schaik vschaik@aim.uzh.ch. We will in-
form candidates before Christmas, and conduct on-
line interviews in the second half of January. The

insect-microbial partnerships. Over the last 480 million
years, insects have repeatedly formed partnerships with
microbes to gain novel and adaptive functions. The gain
of benecial partners has been particularly important
for the evolution of vertebrate parasitism by insects.
My lab is currently focused on understanding the roles
of benecial microbes in parasitic insects, with multi-
ple lines of research on both blood and feather feeding
lice. The successful applicant will have opportunities
to study one or more elements of the louse microbiome
and how each element has contributed to the evolution
of parasitism.
The successful applicant will receive training in bioin-
formatics; phylogenetics and phylogenomics; compara-
tive phylogenetics; genome sequencing, assembly, and

January 2021): The recent revolution of large-scale
sequencing technologies has unveiled a vast amount
of viruses in insects, including also DNA viruses. In
addition to pathological 'overt' infections, many viruses
produce silent or 'covert' infections in their hosts,
which are often vertically transmitted from parent
to ospring. Under certain conditions, such covert
infections can switch to overt, lethal, infections. Here
we aim to determine the mechanism by which large
dsDNA viruses are maintained as covert infections in
insects. In addition, the conditions and mechanism
facilitating a transition from covert to overt infections
will be studied. Furthermore, the eect of covert viruses
on host tness are investigated. Understanding these
processes is needed to predict, prevent and control
diseases in insect mass rearing, enabling sustainable
rearing of insects. The knowledge obtained will be
fundamental to develop tailored detection methods and
to optimize insect mass rearing methods.December 1, 2020 EvolDir 47

The Biology Department at Western Washington Uni-
versity has openings for graduate students starting
Fall 2021. Faculty members in the department oer
a wide range of expertise, from molecular biology to
ecology. Graduate students are eligible for teaching
assistantships, which fund the majority of tuition and
provide a stipend of $12,411 per academic year. WWU
is located in Bellingham, WA, a coastal city north of
Seattle at the base of Mt. Baker in the northwestern
part of the state. We strongly advise interested students
to contact potential advisors in their area of specialty
to get more details about individual labs.
APPLICATION DUE DATE: Feb. 1, 2021

Cooper: The Cooper Evo-Devo lab focuses on aspects
of development that have shaped long-term evolution-
ary patterns. We are particularly interested in how
changes in skull morphogenesis alter the cranial me-
chanics of shes in ways that allow them to invade new
feeding niches. To do this we combine several dierent
approaches that include studies of wild- caught marine
sh larvae from the Salish Sea, experimental work with
genetically modied zebrash, using high-speed video
to collect biomechanical data, transcriptomic studies
of sh skull development, genetic mapping, and evolu-
tionary studies of cranial form and function. Because
our work is highly integrative, our lab group can ac-
commodate students with a diverse range of interests.

Lina Dalberg: The Dahlberg Lab uses the model or-
ganism C. elegans to probe the neurobiological, cellular,
and behavioral role for proteins involved in a ubiquitin-
dependent processes called Endoplasmic Reticulum As-
sociated Degradation (ERAD). Student projects will
use a variety of techniques, including uorescence mi-
croscopy, behavioral assays, and biochemical characteri-
zation to investigate how ERAD targets neural receptors
for degradation. A second, NSF-funded project focuses
on improving metacognitive skills in undergraduate Biol-
ogy students; students interested in this project should
have experience (via coursework or research) in educa-tion and pedagogy research. http://faculty.wwu.edu/-
dahlbec/ Nick Galati: Cilia are evolutionarily ancient,
hair-like projections that generate hydrodynamic force
and process extracellular information. The goal of our
lab is to understand how cells build cilia, with a specic
focus on how individual proteins trac to and from
a structure at the base of cilia, called the basal body.
Much like trac cameras and GPS illuminate vehicular
trac patterns, we aim to create a spatial map of protein
movement to and from cilia as they assemble and sense
the environment. To do this, we combine high-resolution
uorescence microscopy with digital image analysis to
detect and quantify ciliary protein tracking in space
and over time. Our analyses are primarily conducted in
mammalian cells and in the protist Tetrahymena.

search Council (CSIC) and the Pompeu Fabra University
(UPF). It is located in Barcelona (Spain), in front of
the Mediterranean.
The mission of the IBE is to address biodiversity studies
describing functional and evolutionary genomics at all
levels of observation: molecular, biochemical, physiolog-
ical, and morphological. The IBE is the only research
center in Catalonia and Spain which completely devotes

About the Metazoa Phylogenomics Lab:
The overarching goal of the lab is to understand how
animals reshape their genomes to generate their vast
diversity and to adapt to the dierent environments.
For that, we generate and interrogate genomic and tran-
scriptomic data through the lens of phylogenomics. Our
favorite creatures are arthropods and annelids, but our
interest often transcends the level of phylum to under-
stand animal genome evolution at a macroevolutionary
scale. We are committed to maintaining a respectful,
inclusive, and friendly working environment for all sta
and students, as well as promoting your personal and
career development.
Rosa Fern ^A'ndez joined IBE as a Group Leader in Jan-
uary 2020, so this is a chance to help build a lab from
the ground up and contribute your knowledge and pas-
sion to the group and its culture. The lab is a part of
the Animal Biodiversity and Evolution Program at IBE.
This position is funded by an ERC Starting Grant to
understand the genomic basis of terrestrialization across
animals.
About the role:
- Lead eorts in the lab to develop methods and resources
for non-model organisms, and use these resources and
pipelines to address novel questions in genome assem-
bly and annotation, phylogenomics and comparative
genomics.
- Work closely with the other team members to advise
and help on analysis of sequencing data and other bio-
logical 'big data'.
- Manage the computational resources of the lab, includ-
ing data storage, computing resources and databases.
About you:
- PhD in evolutionary biology, computational biology,
bioinformatics or a related eld, or a Masters degree
with at least 3 years of experience with bioinformatics
methods.
- Excellent programming skills in languages commonly
used in bioinformatics (such as Python or R).
- Fluency with Linux shell scripting and high perfor-
mance computing.
- Strong background in computational and evolutionary
biology.
- High motivation and eciency; ability to work inde-
pendently and as part of a team.
- Prociency in English (oral and written).Additional information:
The position is available for 12 months, with the pos-
sibility of further renewal for several consecutive years.
Starting date is expected in March 2021 or as soon as
possible afterwards.
Interviews will be held in early January either in per-
son or via video conference depending on travel needs
and current restrictions; no particular preference will be
given to candidates who are able to interview in person.
We are committed to diversity and especially encourage
women and members of underrepresented communities
to apply.

MarineInvertebrateEvolution
Principal Engineer in ArtsDatabanken project
About the position A part-time position as Principal
Engineer (80%) is available at the Natural History Mu-
seum (NHM), University of Oslo for two years. The
expected starting date is 01.04.2021.
The Prinicipal Engineer will be part of the recently
founded ArtsDatabanken-project \Assessing biodiver-
sity in the marine algae belt". The marine algae belt
comprising kelp forests, seagrass meadows and rocky
reefs with coralline red seaweeds is one of the most
active primary producing environments in the sea. It
also harbors are great diversity of animals including
sea squirts, ribbon worms, nick worms, serpulid worms,
spionid worms and ghost shrimps. The species of these
groups occupy important ecological functions as herbi-
vores, predators and lter-feeding organisms and can
be sessile or agile as well as solitary or colonial. Glob-
ally these taxa comprise more than 7,000 species with
around 250 species documented from Norwegian waters.
Despite this the knowledge about their taxonomy and
distribution in Norway is at best poor and in dire need
of improvement. Specimens in museum collections are
often quite old material, which additionally is often
wrongly determined due to unresolved taxonomic issues
including the high degree of cryptic species in thesegroups. Besides cryptic species, many of these taxa
include invasive species causing among others high eco-
nomic damage in aquaculture and ship transportation
due to biofouling. This is why we will conduct a eld in-
ventory in this habitat and collect species of these taxa
in Norway (from the Skagerrak up to 70 ^AoN). With
morphological and molecular methods, we will deter-
mine the species and learn more about their distribution
(including reports from history and now) and their as-
sociation with Norwegian nature types. Therefore, we
also want to revise the existing museum collections in
Norway. Through the project, we will contribute to
basic biosystematics and species distribution research
in general, and more specically and importantly to red
lists or other nature conservation management actions
(e.g. updated information on distributions of invasive
and native species including cryptic ones and their pre-
ferred habitats). The Natural History Museum has a
modern DNA laboratory as well as microscopic infras-
tructure needed for the project. The position will be
associated with the research group \Frontiers in Evolu-
tionary Zoology", specically Torsten Struck (Professor
of Evolutionary Genomics).

The BPRI focuses on understanding locust phase
polyphenism, one of the most striking examples of co-
ordinated phenotypic plasticity. This phenomenon pro-
vides a powerful comparative system for understanding
how gene expression patterns and epigenetic regulation
are linked to shifts in behavior, physiology, and ecology
that result in outbreaks, collective movement, and mass
migration. The BPRI has been established to compre-
hensively dissect this phenomenon and use it as a model
system to transform the study of phenotypic plasticity.
With a commitment to improving diversity, inclusion
and equity, the BPRI will train the next generation of
integrative biologists who can eciently navigate across
dierent disciplines.
The vision of the BPRI is predicated on integration
through collaboration. We recognize the scientic and
societal impacts are maximized when groups of people
with diverse backgrounds and experiences come together
to work towards shared goals and the common good.
This philosophy will inform all BPRI activities.

CichlidEvolution
Reference: Research Assistant Position
Contract: Full-time, 12 months (possibility of yearly
renewal)
Location: University of Maryland, College Park MD
Application deadline: December 1st or until lled
Research: Cichlid shes are some of the most diverse
species on the planet. They have rapidly speciated from
South America to Africa to India, over quite recent
times making them a textbook example of adaptive ra-
diations. Cichlid dier in nearly every aspect of their
ecology and physiology and make a wonderful model for
understanding phenotypic diversity and rapid speciation.
We are fortunate that at the University of Maryland,
we have three cichlid groups. This makes for a vibrant
community of researchers working to understand the
genetic and genomic basis of cichlid diversity underlying
their neuroethology, visual communication, and sexual
determination.
Along with their other modes of diversity, cichlids have
some of the most variable visual sensitivities in all of ver-
tebrates. Species dier in their sensitivities to dierent
parts of the light spectrum. This is the result of species
expressing dierent subsets of the seven available cone
opsin genes. This produces species sensitive to either
UV to green wavelengths, violet to green wavelengths,
or blue to red wavelengths. We have shown that thesedierences are linked to varying ecologies including the
local light environment and foraging styles. We have
also used behavioral training experiments to show that
cichlids utilize color vision in these important tasks.
We have made some progress in identifying the genetic
and genomic mechanisms behind how the seven cone
opsin genes are dierentially regulated. We have also
identied some candidate genes that form part of the
opsin regulatory network. This project is a collabora-
tion between the lab of Dr Scott Juntti and Dr Karen
Carleton. We are working to make CRISPR mutants to
test the role of several of the candidate regulatory genes.
This will help us unravel the more complete regulatory
network and see how it varies across cichlid diversity.
The position: We are looking for a Research Assistant
who can help manage the generation of CRISPR mu-
tants. This will include performing CRISPR injections,
and rearing and breeding new cichlid lines. In addition,
the research assistant will perform wet lab experiments
such as PCR for genotyping and quantitative PCR for
quantifying gene expression. They will also be trained in
next generation sequencing technologies. The goal will
be to contribute to generating data as well as assisting
with manuscript preparation.
The ideal candidate:The ideal candidate will have at
least a BSc (undergraduate) degree in life sciences. Some
molecular biology experience is desirable, including DNA
and RNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, genotyping,
or quantitative PCR. Strong organizational and record-
keeping skills are important. It is key to have some
independence but also be willing to work as a member
of team of graduate student, post-doctoral and faculty
researchers. We are currently also looking for post-
doctoral fellows in neuroscience (Juntti lab).

letter, and list of references to kcarleto@umd.edu.

Title: Seeking avian tissue samples for denovo genome
sequencing or unpublished avian denovo genomes; col-
laboration in the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) Project
Text:
Since 2010 a global consortium lead by Prof Guojie
Zhang (University of Copenhagen and BGI) has been
generating draft genomes spanning the diversity of bird
species. In this project we are generating a public re-70 EvolDir December 1, 2020
source of de novo sequenced avian genomes in a \top
down" hierarchical strategy. Our initial paper releasing
1 genome per avian order was published in a special
issue of Science in 2014 and our recent follow up in
Nature (in press) releases genomes representing 95% of
avian families.
Our consortium is currently entering phase 3, in which
we aim to sequence and release 1 genome per avian
genus. Thanks to broad international collaboration, we
are in the process of generating data from over 1000
avian genera, but we are still looking for collaborators
interested in helping us ll sampling gaps at the genus
level.
Specically we are looking for researchers who may be
interested in joining our collaboration in the following
ways:
a) Be interested in contributing to the consortium' ^As
goals by providing biological materials of top quality,
and obtained under appropriate permits, for use in gen-
erating de novo reference genomes. Our approach is
based on a combination of single tube long fragment
read (stLFR) and BGISeq technology, the samples must
have been adequately stored so that they contain DNA
fragments of at least >40k bp DNA. Typically, this
means nitrogen-frozen soft tissues or blood, although
other storage conditions (e.g. RNAlater) can preserve
DNA adequately. All contributed samples must have
been collected according to all local, national, and in-
ternational laws, including the Nagoya Protocol when
it applies.
Any genomes generated from contributed tissue materi-
als will be provided at no cost to the sample source, for
immediate use in their own research.
b) Be able to contribute existing, unpublished genome
sequence data to the consortium. Specically we hope
to hear from researchers that have unpublished de novo
sequenced avian genomes, who would be interested join-
ing the collaboration by providing early access to thier
data, for use in the pan-genera comparative analyses.
Ultimately we plan to publish a genus scale compara-
tive genomics paper on the nal dataset, with all sam-
ple/data providers oered co-authorship.
A full list of the genera from which we are currently
seeking genomes and/or samples can be found here:

ESEB 2 CallAwards Hewitt
MaynardSmith
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2021 - Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB annually oers mobility grants for young scientists
in his name.
Closing date: Friday, 15 January 2021.
*Eligibility: *
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and ESEB
members. In addition, applicants will be considered
who are more than 6 years from the start of their PhD
if they have had career breaks, worked part-time, or for
other reasons have not worked continuously. Applicants
who have previously received a Godfrey Hewitt mobility
award are not eligible. The maximum single award will
be 2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or
a period of research at a lab that you have not previ-
ously visited. There is no restriction on the country of
residence or nationality of the applicant.
Due to the COVID-19 situation, and in order to pro-
mote responsible and safe travel without compromising
the quality of research, grantees of the 2021 ESEB God-
frey Hewitt mobility awards will be allowed to travel
within 24 months from the date of announcement of the
winners.
*Application procedure: *
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Moniatte at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from your
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100December 1, 2020 EvolDir 71
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded from
your home institution or your proposed host institution.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Frida Ben-Ami. The aim will be to announce deci-
sions before the end of March 2021. The committee will
consider the following key criteria:
1.The value of the proposed mobility in terms of its
expected output and impact on the applicant's career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant's existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant's own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant's career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.

TangledBank InstructorResources
I'll be teaching from The Tangled Bank (Carl Zimmer)
in the spring and I'm looking for instructor resources,specically images of the book's gures. MacMillan
doesn't even list the book on their website, so I don't
think these are available from the publisher anymore.
Does anyone perhaps have these, either on a DVD or
the book in .pdf form?

ColoradoStateU MolecularEvolution
The Sloan lab at Colorado State University is recruit-
ing a postdoctoral researcher who is broadly interested
in molecular evolution to work on cellular integration
of mitochondrial and nuclear protein synthesis. With
the support of a new NSF grant, the lab will be inves-
tigating how the dynamic history of plant mitochon-
drial tRNA populations aects interactions with the
nuclear-encoded enzymes responsible for tRNA editing
and charging. In particular, we will investigate the
ongoing loss of tRNA genes from the mitochondrial
genomes of certain plants and how they are functionally
replaced by importing cytosolic (nuclear) tRNAs that
are separated by billions of years of evolution.
The project will include both comparative genomic and
molecular genetic wet-lab components. A postdoc would
have the opportunity to contribute to either or both ofthese areas depending on their skills and interests. Rel-
evant areas of experience could include one or more of
the following: protein sequence evolution, mitonuclear
interactions, gene duplication, subcellular targeting, pro-
tein import, protoplast transformation, uorescence mi-
croscopy, and both short-read and long-read sequencing
technologies.
Our lab is in the Department of Biology, which is housed
in a state-of-the-art research facility that opened in 2017.
The department includes numerous labs in the elds of
both plant molecular biology and evolutionary biology,
so there are ample opportunities for collaboration out-
side the lab group. The university is in Fort Collins,
Colorado, which routinely ranks among the top locations
in the country in terms of overall quality of life. More
information about our lab is available at our lab website:
https://sites.google.com/site/danielbsloan/ We will be
looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher
who is excited about addressing evolutionary questions
at the molecular level and wants to contribute to a pos-
itive and collaborative intellectual environment. Start
date is exible, but we envision someone joining the
lab in spring, summer, or early fall 2021. Inquiries can
be e-mailed to Dan Sloan (dbsloan@rams.colostate.edu)
and should include a CV and a brief statement of re-
search/career goals. Evaluation will begin January 1,
but inquiries are still highly encouraged after that point.

POSTDOC POSITION IN EVO DEVO AND ECO
DEVO OF HORNED BEETLES (Moczek-Lab, Indiana
University, Bloomington)
A full-time postdoctoral position is available in Armin
Moczek's lab (https://ecoevodevo.com/), Department
of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington. Our lab
conducts research in the evolutionary developmental
(evo-devo) and ecological developmental (eco-devo) biol-
ogy of insects. We focus on the genetic, developmental,
and ecological mechanisms, and their interactions, that
mediate the origins and diversication of novel complex
traits (such as beetle horns, rey lanterns, or treehop-
per helmets) and functions (such as nutrition-responsive
development, sexual dimorphisms, or alternative repro-
ductive tactics).
The position will focus on identifying the genes and path-
ways underlying the origin and diversication of horns
and other complex traits in the extraordinarily diverse
beetle genus Onthophagus. Specically, the work will
use genomic and candidate-gene approaches to identify
and functionally characterize the developmental-geneticmechanisms that regulate horn morphology (size, shape,
position, integration), context-dependent expression of
horns (sex- and nutrition-specicity), and how evolu-
tionary changes in these mechanisms have mediated
diversication within and among species. This position
is fully funded by a multi-year grant from the National
Science Foundation.
The postdoctoral candidate would have opportunities
to develop additional independent lines of research in
these and related areas.
We seek a collegial, self-motivated, independent, and
intellectually curious individual with a recent PhD in
Evolutionary Biology, Developmental Biology, or related
elds required at the time of appointment. Applicants
must have strong bench skills, and familiarity with tech-
niques such as RNAinterference, CRISPR-Cas9, qPCR,
cloning, immuno-histochemistry, and the bioinformatic
analyses of next-gen sequencing data is strongly desir-
able (though training in these techniques will also be
provided as necessary). In addition, candidates must
have demonstrated excellent written and oral communi-
cation skills. Experience working with insects is helpful
but not required. The position is initially available for
12 months, with likely extension for a second and third
year funds permitting. Salary will be commensurate
with experience, and full benets are included.
Indiana University has a large and interactive group at
the interface of evolutionary and developmental biology
and ecology. Bloomington is situated in scenic, hilly
southern Indiana, near several parks and wilderness
areas. The cultural environment provided by the Uni-
versity is exceptionally rich in art, music, and theater.

Postdoctoral position in historical DNA, extinction risk,
and a genetic time series
A postdoc position is available to work on historical
DNA from bird sub-fossils, museum skin specimens and
fresh samples to develop a novel real-time assessment ofgenetic response to anthropogenic environmental change
across multiple bird species following rst human arrival

examine the long-term processes leading to variation in
extinction risk between closely related species, compar-
ing dierences in demographic and selective responses
to common environmental changes.
The position is part of a project funded by the French
National Research Agency (ANR), that links compe-
tences of two research centres in France. In Toulouse,
the UMR AMIS is among the leading laboratories world-
wide in ancient DNA studies, and will be the postdoc's

Evolutionary history is expected to play a major role
in determining which species decline in population size
to extinction in response to environmental change, but
the processes by which this comes about are poorly un-
derstood. Although population genetic studies provide
much promise to understand the microevolutionary pro-
cesses behind macroevolutionary patterns of extinction
risk, inferences can be limited by our condence in the
timescales inferred, and by the scale of such studies,
which frequently include only one lineage. As a key-
player in project ANR Suscept-Ext, the postdoc will
tackle both of these issues, applying ancient DNA meth-
ods to museum (historical & subfossil) samples to obtain
a genome-wide time series for multiple Mascarene island
bird lineages that dier in abundance and other biologi-
cal traits. Islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Mau-
ritius & R eunion), Indian Ocean, are unusual amongDecember 1, 2020 EvolDir 87
sizable and biologically diverse landmasses worldwide,
in that they had no human population until European
arrival 400 years ago. Therefore, there exist museum
samples and subfossils spanning the full duration of an-
thropogenic environmental change, allowing a real-time
assessment of genetic response to environmental changes
of known timing and across multiple species following
rst human presence.
Major goals for the postdoc include: 1) as a top priority,
developing a working protocol and obtaining reliable
genome-wide data from a variety of bird historical DNA
samples, including museum skins (toe-pads), and sub-
fossils up to 12,000 YBP from a variety of preserva-
tional environments including limestone and volcanic
rock caves (essential), as well as attempting those of
anoxic marshes;
2) playing a key role in DNA extraction and interac-
tion with external genomics companies in order to ob-
tain both de novo reference genomes and re-sequenced
genomes from fresh samples;
3) analysing the resulting genetic time series (modern
and historical genome-wide data of varying complete-
ness) to track temporal changes in demography and
selection since rst human arrival in the Mascarenes ~
400 generations ago.
Funding has also been obtained for a PhD student to
work alongside the postdoc in data analysis, the ancient
DNA lab and/or method development, beginning by
Year 2 at the latest.
Candidates are expected to have proven experience in
generating and analysing genome-wide ancient or his-

- have a strong interest in the broad theme of the study
- understanding the role of evolutionary history in de-
termining which species decline towards extinction in

bird lineages that dier in abundance and other biologi-
cal traits. Islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Mau-
ritius & R eunion), Indian Ocean, are unusual among
sizable and biologically diverse landmasses worldwide,
in that they had no human population until European
arrival 400 years ago. Therefore, there exist museum
samples and subfossils spanning the full duration of an-
thropogenic environmental change, allowing a real-time
assessment of genetic response to environmental changes
of known timing and across multiple species following
rst human presence.
Major goals for the postdoc include: 1) as a top priority,
developing a working protocol and obtaining reliable
genome-wide data from a variety of bird historical DNA
samples, including museum skins (toe-pads), and sub-
fossils up to 12,000 YBP from a variety of preserva-
tional environments including limestone and volcanic
rock caves (essential), as well as attempting those of
anoxic marshes;
2) playing a key role in DNA extraction and interac-
tion with external genomics companies in order to ob-
tain both de novo reference genomes and re-sequenced
genomes from fresh samples;
3) analysing the resulting genetic time series (modern
and historical genome-wide data of varying complete-
ness) to track temporal changes in demography and
selection since rst human arrival in the Mascarenes ~
400 generations ago.
Funding has also been obtained for a PhD student to
work alongside the postdoc in data analysis, the ancient
DNA lab and/or method development, beginning by
Year 2 at the latest.
Candidates are expected to have proven experience in
generating and analysing genome-wide ancient or his-
torical DNA data, and should ideally:
- have a strong interest in the broad theme of the study
- understanding the role of evolutionary history in de-
termining which species decline towards extinction inresponse to environmental change - be interested in rel-
evant population genomic methods - show willingness,
if needed, to play a key role in training a PhD student
to help with the historical DNA wetlab work

GenomicsAdaptiveDivergence
2-year post-doc position - the genomics of adaptive di-
vergence
A postdoc position investigating the eect of gene ow
on adaptive divergence in experimental populations of
the ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is avail-
able in the research group of Jochen Wolf at Munich
University, Germany.
Background Adaptive divergence describes how new
forms can arise from a shared common ancestor by
adaptation to dierent environments and is thought to
be essential for the formation of new species by means of
natural selection. Under geographical isolation, adaptive
divergence readily results as a by-product of ecological
specialization. Under conditions of gene ow, however,
the conditions under which divergence may arise is a
matter of debate. Gene ow might breakup benecial
combinations resulting in generalist phenotypes, but on
the other hand can introduce novel variation that might
facilitate novel adaptations. Due to the complex inter-
actions between local adaptation, life history trade-os,
and genetic interactions, determining the mechanisms
leading to divergence in natural systems is challeng-
ing. Controlled, replicated evolution experiments are
a promising, yet largely unexplored way, to generate
insight on the genetic basis of adaptive divergence in the
context of gene ow. The Project We have been running
an experimental evolution study for six years using the
haploid ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in
which we vary the amount of migration while applying
disruptive selection. The rst analyses of the 132 repli-
cate populations after 53 asexual generations (3 years
into the experiment) showed divergence to be strongestDecember 1, 2020 EvolDir 89
in allopatry as would be expected. Yet, also with the
highest levels of gene-ow divergent ecological adapta-
tion arose (1). In this project we will further analyse
the populations (currently at 150 sexual generations,
including ~2000 asexual generations). We are speci-
cally interested to understand how genetic correlations
(trade-os) between life history traits aect ecological
adaptation and which genetic architecture the stable
maintenance of divergence against gene ow. We will
analyse time series and haplotype data to understand if
and how divergent phenotypes are maintained over time
and test hypotheses such as antagonistic pleiotropy, neg-
ative epistasis, and assortative mating. This experiment
with its stored longitudinal collection of population sam-
ples, which can be revived any time, is a great resource
and evolution playground for any evolutionary geneti-
cist. Qualications The successful applicant holds a PhD
degree, preferably with experience in experimental evo-
lution, population genetics, comparative genomics, and
has the bioinformatic skillset to analyse large genome-
wide data sets. Basic knowledge of molecular biology
techniques are expected, but specic training in yeast-
genetics and -genomics will be provided. The position
is open to researchers willing to perform both experi-
mental and bioinformatic/population genetic analyses.
Previous experience with yeast, quantitative genetics
and/or statistical modelling (e.g. linear mixed mod-
els) is a clear asset. Research environment of the host
lab The Wolf lab applies an integrative approach to
explore micro-evolutionary processes and genetic mech-
anisms underlying species divergence, adaptation and
genome evolution (2, 3). Using large-scale genomic ap-
proaches combined with eld and lab-based experiments,
we characterize genetic diversity within and between
populations and assess its relationship to phenotypic
divergence (4-6) - sometimes interpreting the data un-
der a conservation angle (7, 8). In addition, we explore
methodological aspects of data analyses (9, 10) and
engage in comparative approaches to study evolution
across larger timescales (11, 12). Empirical systems
currently include natural populations of birds (swallows,
cuckoos and corvids (4-6, 13, 14)), marine mammals
(pinnipeds and killer whales) (15, 16) and ssion yeast
(1, 17, 18). More information on the research activities
in the lab can be found at http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/-

is consistently ranked among the top Universities world-
wide, in particular the life science branch with its newly
inaugurated campus oering excellent technical facilities
and many interaction possibilities including the gene
center, several Max-Planck-Institutes and the Helmholtz

LandscapeGenetics
NatHistMuseum.Luxembourg.LandscapeGenetics
A three-year postdoc position funded by the Luxem-
bourg Research Fund is available in the Zoology De-
partment of the National Natural History Museum,
Luxembourg (MNHNL). The postdoc will work with
Alain Frantz (MNHNL) and Ximo Mengual (Zoologis-
ches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn)
The project
The overall objective of the proposed study is to use
landscape genetic resistance modelling to analyse the
functional connectivity of typical Luxembourg and West-
ern European landscapes from the viewpoint of hov-
eries (Diptera: Syrphidae). We aim to understand
whether urbanisation and the structural diversity of
agro-ecosystems have an impact on hovery dispersal
and which landscape features facilitate or hinder gene
ow. The approach will be conducted for four target
species in three urbanised areas and two pairs of rural
areas with dierent degrees of habitat diversity. Among
other aims, we will also test whether hovery size and
habitat specialisation may inuence the impact of habi-
tat fragmentation on the ies.
What we require
Applicants should have a doctorate (PhD) in natural
sciences with a background in genetics, molecular ecol-
ogy, entomology and/or related disciplines. Applicants
should have a strong interest in landscape genetics, i.e.
in the use of large genetic datasets to make inferences
about eective dispersal in animals. Ideally, candidates
should have experience in bioinformatics, a proven track
record in entomological eld work and they should not
shy away from laboratory work.90 EvolDir December 1, 2020
The successful applicant will be responsible for collect-
ing samples in the eld, performing some laboratory
work and analysing the landscape genetic data. She/he
will disseminate the results of the project through pre-
sentations and scientic publications.
Applicants should have a strong interest to work in an
interdisciplinary team so that excellent knowledge of
English is required. A driving licence is essential.
What we oer
A three-year contract with a competitive salary is of-
fered. The post-doc will be based mainly in the Zoology
research group at the MNHNL in Luxembourg City.
The group has recently been re-established and is a well-
funded, ambitious research group. As a postdoc you
will benet from easy access to your supervisors, but
are expected to take on a leadership role relative to the
more junior members of the team. While the project at
hand is very ambitious, the position oers the prospect
of signicant autonomy. Throughout the years, a large
number of genetic data sets have accumulated in the
department that would lend themselves to landscape
genetic analyses.
The MNHNL is an equal opportunity employer and is
committed to increasing the proportion of women in
academics. Consequently, we actively encourage ap-
plications by women. We also welcome applications
from candidates with severe disabilities. Disabled candi-
dates with equivalent qualications will be preferentially
considered.
How to apply
Applications should be written in English and compiled
into a single PDF le. The application should include
a cover letter (including the date on which the appli-
cants could start the position, their motivation for this
position and future research interests), curriculum vitae
and copies of university degrees. Application material
should be submitted no later than the 15th of December
to alain.frantz@mnhn.lu. The same address can be used
for informal inquiries. The (strongly) preferred starting
date is the 1st of February 2021.

Postdoctoral Positions in the Champer Lab at Peking
University Center for Life Sciences
Multiple postdoctoral positions are available in the
Champer lab at Peking University in the School of Life
Sciences and the joint Center for Life Sciences. Jackson
Champer is scheduled to open the lab in early 2021. En-
tering postdocs can be experimental or computational,
though individuals interested in both areas of research
are also welcome.
Lab Overview
The main initial topic of the lab will be CRISPR gene
drive. This type of allele can bias inheritance in its
favor, potentially allowing it to spread throughout a
population. There are many possible applications, such
as spreading genes in mosquitoes that prevent trans-
mission of malaria, dengue, and other diseases that kill
hundreds of thousands of people every year. Gene drive
can even be used for conservation purposes, such as
suppression of invasive species. The lab will likely be
pursuing additional related topics in the near future.
Initial goals of the lab will be: 1. To develop new types
of gene drives using the fruit y as a model organism.
2. To develop highly ecient gene drives that avoid
\resistance" in mosquitoes. 3. To use computational
modeling to assess how well gene drives will actually
perform in real-world environments.
The general lab philosophy is to provide a friendly and
supportive environment to help individuals be produc-
tive and achieve their career goals.
Application Requirements
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in biology or any other
scientic or quantitative eld.
Experimental postdocs should preferably have experi-
ence in molecular cloning and either y or mosquito
handling.
Computational postdocs should have a solid background
in at least one programming language, such as python,
R, or C++, and preferably experience in population
modeling with simulations.
Applicants should have adequate English skills.

TexasAMU PheonotypicPlasticity
Postdoctoral position available at the Behavioral Plas-
ticity Research Institute
A postdoctoral position is available in the Department
of Entomology at Texas A&M University, College Sta-
tion, TX, USA. The position is part of the Behavioral
Plasticity Research Institute (BPRI), one of the U.S.
National Science Foundation' ^As four newly established
Biology Integration Institutes ( https://www.nsf.gov/-
news/special reports/announcements/090120.03.jsp).
The BPRI focuses on understanding locust phase
polyphenism, one of the most striking examples of co-
ordinated phenotypic plasticity. This phenomenon pro-
vides a powerful comparative system for understanding
how gene expression patterns and epigenetic regulation
are linked to shifts in behavior, physiology, and ecology
that result in outbreaks, collective movement, and mass
migration. The BPRI is established to comprehensively
dissect this phenomenon and use it as a model system

Postdoc position: population genetics theory with high
mutation rate
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna
Masel (http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel/-
people/joanna/) at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
Being computational, the position is amenable to re-
mote work, and eorts will be made to accommodate
all situations. That said, Tucson is located in the bio-
diverse Sonoran desert, surrounded on all four sides by
mountainous national and state parks, with an attrac-
tive climate for most of the year. Stipend is at NIH
rates, and the cost of living in Tucson is relatively low.The question we want to answer is, as Kondrashov put
it, \why have we not died 100 times over?" given the
estimated high (U >1) prevalence of deleterious muta-
tions https://doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.1995.0167. In current
simulations of realistically high genome-wide deleteri-
ous mutation rates, relative tness must constantly be
renormalized so as not to be overwhelmed by a Muller's
ratchet of xations of small eect size deleterious muta-
tions, even in large sexual populations.
We have devised a powerful new computational approach
that can capture realistic linkage as well as realistically
high population sizes and mutation rates for species
such as humans. This postdoc's rst task will be to
nish adapting our relative tness code to instead be
grounded in absolute tness. This will open up a variety
of questions about population viability / mutational
meltdown, reproductive compensation, and the best
approach to modeling epistasis, depending on interests.
Excellent computer programming skills are required, ide-
ally including both C and Python. Prior knowledge of
theoretical population genetics is preferred, although ex-
ceptionally strong computational scientists from highly
quantitative backgrounds outside evolutionary biology
will also be considered, as will non-theoreticians who can
demonstrate deep understanding of theoretical issues.
Start date is negotiable, and funding is secured through
December 2023.

UCLouvain Insect Learning for Rapid Adaptation to
changing habitats
Postdoc position in Evolutionary Ecology
We are looking for highly motivated candidates to apply
for a 2 to 4-year postdoctoral position, funded through
UCLouvain university (\Action de recherche concert ee"),
in the laboratory of Prof Caroline Nieberding (https://-
nieberdinglab.be/, UCLouvain, Belgium).
Animals were long thought not to learn. Over the years
research has, however, revealed that most animals do
learn to some extent. This paradigm shift has led to the
hypothesis that learning is a form of behavioural plas-
ticity that participates to rapid adaptation of natural
populations in nature, in response to human induced
habitat degradations. Yet, the adaptive value of learn-
ing remains rarely quantied so far. This project will
quantify the adaptive value of learning in the eld in a
number of buttery species facing increasing reduction
and fragmentation of suitable habitats. Butteries are
agship and bioindicator species of the quality of Eu-
ropean natural habitats, and we have occurrence data
spanning several decades. This project aims at provid-
ing one of the rst eld-based estimates of the selective
value of learning for a key behavioural trait, oviposition
site selection (\OSS" hereafter). OSS is key to coloni-
sation of suitable habitats in butteries, the larvae ofDecember 1, 2020 EvolDir 99
which have only a low mobility. As learning is costly,
we expect that increased learning and memory skills are
correlated to reduced survival and/or egg production
and we will quantify potential trade-os associated with
learning and memory.
The postdoctoral research will include experiments in
the eld in Belgium and ecologically-relevant experi-
ments in the laboratory, where eld-caught animals can
be monitored. The ideal candidate for this position
will have a strong background in behavioural ecology,
statistical analyses, expertise in buttery ecology and a
capacity for creative and critical thinking. The candi-
date will have opportunities to learn some of the specic
skills required for the project by our network of national
and international collaborators. Applicants should hold
a PhD diploma. The deadline for applications is Decem-
ber 15th, or until the application is lled.
The salary will be around 2000 euro netto per month
plus benets (health insurance,' ^A') which are included
in the Belgian system. Our University is an Equal
Opportunity/Armative Action Employer, and is in a
French-speaking region of Belgium, but the language for
meetings and scientic interactions is English. For back-
ground information about our university, see https:/-

disease resistance for a new EEID- NIH-funded project
\Resistance Variation to Endemic Disease."
In nature hosts are infected by, and co-evolve with a
suite of pathogen species. Empirical studies have shown
that genetic resistance to dierent pathogen species is
often correlated, and critically, that these resistance
correlations can also aect a host's susceptibility to
novel, foreign pathogens. The postdoc would work to
develop general theoretical models that examine the co-

The project is in collaboration with Michael Hood's lab
at Amherst college. The theoretical models developed
as part of the project at Maryland will complement em-
pirical research at Amherst into resistance correlations
to anther-smut disease in *Silene vulgaris.*
This is a two-year appointment. The anticipated start

approaches.
The post-doctoral candidate will be part of the mul-
tidisciplinary project \Hidden crop diversity in Suri-
name: tracing the origins of Maroon rice by integrating
ethnobotany and genomics". This project combinesethnobotanical eld surveys, published historical data,
archival research, and advanced genomic analysis to
discover the genetic diversity, geographical origins and
migration history of traditional rice landraces grown by
Maroons, descendants of enslaved Africans who live in
the Suriname rainforest.

in Maroon rice landraces and compare these to modern
and historic rice accessions and crop wild relatives from
the Guianas, West Africa, Asia and the US, by means
of whole-genome (re)sequencing. You will use Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to quantify diversity
within Surinamese landraces and assess their genetic and
geographical origins with advanced genomic and bioin-
formatic methods. You will search for specic genetic
traits for which these landraces were selected and detect
potential introgressions from wild rice. Close collabora-

To this end, the COST Action G-BiKE <https:/-
/sites.google.com/fmach.it/g-bike-genetics-eu/-
home?authuser=3D0 >together with GEO-BON
and IUCN has recently developed three genetic
indicators to be included in the next strategy (Hoban
et al, 2020 <https://sites.google.com/fmach.it/-
g-bike-genetics-eu/reports-publications/biological-
conservation?authuser=0 >):
1) The number of populations [or breeds] within species
with an eective population size >500 compared to the
number<500.
2) The proportion of (sub)populations [or geographic
range] maintained within species.
3) The number of species and populations in which
genetic diversity is being monitored using DNA-based
methods.
In this one-day online workshop we aim to highlight how
aDNA studies can play a pivotal role for the practical
implementation of the genetic indicators, especially of
1) and 2). Through key lectures and specic fora, we
will present how aDNA studies are already poised to
make these indicators highly informative in the light of
CBD post-2020 Global Biodiversity Strategy.

GenomeResolvedMetagenomics
Feb8-12
Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the LIVE ONLINE
course 'Introduction to Genome-resolved Metagenomics
for Microbial Communities' (FULLY FUNDED SCHOL-
ARSHIPS AVAILABLE)
Instructors: Dr. Tom Delmont (Genoscope, CEA CNRS,
France) Dr. Anna Fotaki (University of Copenhagen,
Denmark)
Dates & Times: February 8th-12th, 2021 9:00-12:00
&14:00-17:00 (GMT+1, Madrid time)December 1, 2020 EvolDir 111
COURSE OVERVIEW:
Shotgun metagenomics, the non-targeted sequencing
of genomes from all microorganisms in a sample, has
brought new insights into microbial ecology. However,
the limited length of individual metagenomic reads (far
smaller than individual genes) is limiting downstream
analyses, stressing the need to reconstruct reads and
make sense of this output. On this front, genome-
resolved metagenomics has emerged as a highly eective
way to identify genomes directly from the metagenomic
assembly outputs, bypassing cultivation to explore the
gene content of individual microbial populations. With
the ever-increasing use of applying next generation se-
quencing technologies to an array of environmental sam-
ples (e.g., microbiomes, oceans, soils), genome-resolved
metagenomics has gained increased attention. Recon-
structing and analysing genomes using metagenomic
data as a starting point can be incredibly informative,
but requires the understanding of key biological con-
cepts (e.g., what is a bacterial population) and learning
of bioinformatics tools (e.g., how to handle metagenomic
assemblies and curate individual genomes).
This course will cover both the biological concepts and
bioinformatics tools to take best advantage of the rapidly
growing eld of genome-resolved metagenomics. Par-
ticipants will also briey be introduced to the analy-
sis of micro-diversity through single-nucleotide variants
and processing of pangenomes to take best advantage
of newly characterised genomes. Course material will
be based on a mixture of lectures and hands-on exer-
cises with real datasets for participants to practice on.
The course is intended for researchers and graduate
students who plan on studying microorganisms with
metagenomics, and are especially interested in genomics
through genome-resolved metagenomics.
Participants should expect to gather a good understand-
ing of genome-resolved metagenomics, which they will
be able to apply to their own metagenomic datasets.

SHIPS for this course. For more information and

Dear all,
last seats available on our course on \Introduction to
RNA Sequencing", which will held online from the 18th
to the 22nd of January.
This course is structured over 5 days of theoretical and
hands-on training and covers the majority of the con-
cepts and challenges commonly faced when analysing
direct RNA-Seq data. It will start from common tasks
such as data QC and gene expression quantication and
then move on to more advanced topics such as transcrip-
tome assembly, polyA-tail length measurements and
RNA modications detection.
This course is intended for an audience of researchers
with a certain degree of familiarity with RNA sequencing
concepts. While not exclusively directed to attendees
with bioinformatics training, the majority of the prac-
ticals will make use of command-line tools. Therefore
some experience with a *nix environment (e.g. Linux or
MacOS) and the shell (e.g. Bash) are highly desirable.
Some familiarity with R will also be an advantage.

The Center for Health in the Human Ecosystem of the
University of Idaho (Moscow, ID, U.S.A.) hosts the an-
nual Biology of Vector-borne Diseases six-day course.
This course provides accessible, condensed training and
\knowledge networking" for advanced graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, faculty and professionals to ensure
competency in basic biology, current trends and devel-
opments, and practical knowledge for U.S. and global
vector-borne diseases of plants, animals and humans.
We seek to train the next generation of scientists and
help working professionals to more eectively address
current and emerging threats with holistic approaches
and a strong network of collaborators and mentors.
The course is both lecture- and discussion-based and
is delivered by internationally recognized experts,
with integrated case studies of emerging vector-borne
pathogens to highlight parallels and key distinctions in
biology across plant, animal and human vector-borne
diseases. This course sets an example of new vision,
through leadership of the Center for Health in the Hu-
man Ecosystem, to create an enduring community of
participants and instructors to expand the impact and
sustainability of these approaches.
The course is scheduled for Sunday through Friday, June
20-25, 2020. The applications portal is open now. Appli-
cants will be notied of their acceptance and invited to
register for the course. The course registration fee (USD
$1,500) includes housing, meals, course materials and
social activities. Registration fee will be due following
acceptance into the course.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
