Three main symposia are proposed:
1. Evolution and ecology of biological diversity in ﬁshes
The main focus of this symposium is the growing recog-
nition of ecological factors as primary forces in the
generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Studies
on ﬁshes, often with focus on behaviour along with
other attributes, have been particularly important in
this area.
2. Ecological approaches to ﬁsheries management and
conservation
Ecosystem concerns, and awareness of human im-
pacts on freshwater and marine resources has increased
rapidly during the last decades. Today, responsible ﬁsh-
eries, aim at sustainable development of ﬁsh stocks both
ecologically and socially. Contributions on all aspects
relating to ecosystem conscious management are wel-
comed. Examples include the inﬂuence of behaviour
and life history on population dynamics and harvesting
potentials of ﬁsh stocks, how exploitation and global
environmental changes may aﬀect behaviour and life
history, and sustainable aquaculture.
3. Evolutionary genetics and ecology of ﬁshes
Evolutionary genetics and molecular ecology is becom-
ing of major importance to ﬁsh ecology, evolution andbehaviour. This ﬁeld is marked by recent important
breakthroughs in studies of population structure, stud-
ies on the evolution of genetic isolation and specia-
tion and in studies on genetic control and evolution
of quantitative characters. Subjects covered in this ses-
sion include ecological selection, identiﬁcation of traits
and mapping of genes that are under natural selection,
rapid responses to environmental changes, and small-
scale variation in ecological traits.
Contributions will consist of both oral and poster pre-
sentations. Proceedings from the meeting will be pub-
lished by Kluwer, in the journal Environmental Biology
of Fishes.

Aug22-26First announcement:
Symposium:
“Progress in Environmental Stress, Adaptation and
Evolution”
August 22-26, 2004 at Sandbjerg, Denmark
Sponsors:
European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
Center for Environmental Stress Research, University
of Aarhus (DK)
Aim:
Most organisms and populations have to cope with hos-
tile environments, threatening their existence. Their
ability to respond phenotypically and genetically to
these challenges and to evolve adaptive mechanisms is,
therefore, crucial. The aim of the symposium is to un-
derstand, from an evolutionary perspective, the impact
of stress on biological systems. We have invited speak-
ers that at diﬀerent organizational levels, from genes
to individuals and populations, explore how organisms
adapt to (extreme) environments genetically and phys-
iologically, how stress changes genetic structure and af-
fects life histories and how environmental and genetic
stress shape selection pressure and causes extinction of
populations.
These issues have already been dealt with in a sympo-
sium on “stress and evolution” during the 5th Interna-
tional Congress of Evolutionary Biology and System-
atics in Budapest (1966), and in the end resulted in a
book edited by us “Environmental Stress, Adaptation
and Evolution (1997)” published in the Birkhuser EXS
series (EXS 83). It is now nearly ten years later and
knowledge and (genomic) techniques in this research
ﬁeld have progressed rapidly. Therefore, we are think-
ing a follow-up to be timely and are organising this
small, 3 day symposium on the same issues
Structure:
The number of participants will be limited to around
50, of which 15 are reserved for invited speakers (for list
see below). There will be room for maximal 40 presen-
tations of which 25 are open for contributed talks (25
min.). In conjunction with the symposium a special
thematic issue of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology
will be published on the topic that will contain high
quality papers by the invited speakers. In addition, it
will be possible for contributed papers to be included
in this special issue of JEB. This will ensure that the
papers get lots of exposure in this thematic setting. Pa-
pers for the special issue will be selected by the organis-
ers of the symposium and the chief editor of JEB, Juha4 EvolDir June 1, 2004
Merila. Mind that all manuscripts, including those of
the invited speakers, will not be treated favourably for
this special issue. They are subject to normal, rigor-
ous peer-review and scope limits of the journal: they
have to address important evolutionary, and not purely
functional, problems.
Participation:
Those that are interested in the symposium topic
and want to participate and/or present a pa-
per are kindly invited to contact the organis-
ers from now on. Please do send your applica-
tion to Corneel Vermeulen (c.j.vermeulen@biol.rug.nl)
who will collect and structure applications (but for
safety do send also a cc to both Volker Loeschcke
(volker.loeschcke@biology.au.dk) and Kuke Bijlsma
(r.bijlsma@biol.rug.nl)), preferably before the 1st of
June. As we, in addition to the invited speakers, can
only accommodate around 35 participants, the sympo-
sium might easily become over-booked. If this is the
case the organisers will select participants and contri-
butions that seem to ﬁt that symposium and the special
volume of JEB the best. Therefore it is important that
tentative participants provide a few lines about their
research interests, and if they want to present a con-
tribution, please provide also a title and a substantial
abstract (up to 200 words). Membership of ESEB is
not prerequisite, but gives a discount of the conference
fee and might give some priority.
Practical information:
Title: Progress in Environmental Stress, Adaptation
and Evolution
Date: August 22-26, 2004
Organisers: Volker Loeschcke, Dept. of Ecology and
Genetics, University of Aarhus (DK)
Kuke Bijlsma, Evolutionary Genetics, University of
Groningen (NL)
Place: Sandbjerg Manor House, in the south of Jutland,
Denmark. This is a conference centre of the University
of Aarhus in a very nice and rural setting, easily reached
by train and plane. For info see: www.sandbjerg.dk/-
en/.
Participants: maximal number approximately 50 (ex-
cept for some invited speakers allotted to ESEB mem-
bers).
Costs: The conference fee is Euro 450 for ESEB mem-
bers Euro 550 for non-members. (Thus ESEB members
get a discount of Euro 100, which is more than twice
the yearly membership fee including the printed version
of JEB and almost four times for online-only members.
So it pays to become a member!). The conference feecovers all costs including full board and lodging from
Sunday evening August 22 to Thursday morning Au-
gust 26.

ULublin Rodents Jul12-16
The 9th International Conference Rodens et Spatium
on Rodent Biology will be held 12-16 July 2004 at the
Catholic University of Lublin, Poland. Initiated in 1987
at Lyon, France, this biennial series focuses on the gen-
eral biology of rodents relative to their environment,
and includes: ethology, ecology, biogeography, taxon-
omy, evolutionary or conservation biology. Rodens &
Spatium conferences typically attract 100-200 partici-
pants from 20-40 countries with a worldwide represen-
tation. The meeting is participant-friendly and open
especially to young scientists from a broad variety of
cultures and disciplines, united around a common or-
ganism: the rodent. The oﬃcial language of the Confer-
ence is English. A friendly atmosphere, multi-cultural
setting, modern topics and an aﬀordable price are key
features for the continuing success of the Rodens &
Spatium Series during its almost 17 years of existence.Deadlines: Final registration, abstract submission: 15

UToulouse OrchidSystematics
NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE SYSTEMATICS &
ECOLOGY OF ORCHIDS
18/20 November 2004
At the University of Toulouse http://www.ladybio.ups-
tlse.fr/Orchid-Symposium Meeting Summary
Our knowledge of the Orchid family has recently un-
dergone several signiﬁcant advances.
Concerning systematics, the ﬁrst morphological classi-
ﬁcation was produced by Swartz two centuries ago, and
the latest by Dressler in 1993. Dressler’s classiﬁcation is
one of the most comprehensive morphologically-based
classiﬁcations to date. However, traditional morpholog-
ically based classiﬁcations rely heavily on characters,
which are often few, if not unique, and can express
considerable convergence due to ecological selection.
The use of molecular markers and cladistics methods
has produced a shift toward a more complex classiﬁca-
tion of Orchids. It provided strong cladistical support
to 5 subfamilies Apostasioideae, Cypripedioideae, Van-
niloideae, Orchidoideae and the Epidendroideae within
the Orchidaceae, but leaves aside some unresolved re-
lationships at lower levels.
To fulﬁl their life cycle, orchids use two kinds of sym-
bionts, i.e. insects for pollination and fungi for hydro-
mineral nutrition: in both cases, cheating strategies re-
peatedly arose during orchid evolution. Insect-orchid
relationships have been well studied at the biochemical6 EvolDir June 1, 2004
and physiological level, and are believed to drive speci-
ation in at least some cases. Non-rewarding orchids, ei-
ther devoid of nectar or acting as mate mimicry, provide
good models for the study evolution of mutualism. Un-
derground association with fungi (mycorrhizae) are nec-
essary for the development of orchids, especially at ger-
mination, when the fungus provides both mineral and
carbon resources to the reserveless seedling. The latter
strategy lasts up to adulthood in mycoheterotrophic,
achlorophyllous species. Current research using molec-
ular techniques has clariﬁed fungal identity and speci-
ﬁcity level in various associations, but the exact nature
of the relationship with the fungi often remains unclear.
This meeting will highlight new developments on the
phylogenetic classiﬁcation, ecology and evolution of Or-
chids, as well as their implications in the ﬁeld of biodi-
versity conservation.

Cambridge Kew EvoDevo
Eco-Evo-Devo PhD studentship in Cambridge/Kew
PhD to be supervised by Dr Beverley Glover (Uni-
versity of Cambridge) in collaboration with Dr Paula
Rudall and Dr Vincent Savolainen (Jodrell Laboratory,
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew). See details below.
IMPORTANT: To apply, please visit http:/-
/www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/plantsci/research/-phdstudentships/ highlighted.html and follow strictly
the application procedure. In addition, please also
send your CV and a brief letter explaining the reasons
for applying to the ’beetle-daisy’ project via email to
Dr Beverley Glover (bjg26@cam.ac.uk) by 10 June
2004.
Note that stipends are paid only to UK residents.
In search of the ’beetle identity gene’ in the ﬂy-
pollinated beetle daisy Gorteria diﬀusa in southern
Africa
Gorteria diﬀusa is a South African species of Aster-
aceae which is commonly named the ’beetle daisy’ afterJune 1, 2004 EvolDir 7
the beetle-like structures (raised dark spots) that are
present at the bases of the large petals of some (1ˆ a3) of
the ray ﬂorets (see attached ﬁgure). Pollination studies
in South Africa have demonstrated that these ’beetle’
structures are most likely mimics not of beetles but
instead of small bee-ﬂies, which are the actual pollina-
tors of Gorteria (Johnson & Midley, 1997). Johnson
& Midley’s (1997) investigation also showed that the
morphology of the dark spot is surprisingly complex,
consisting of at least three diﬀerent cell types. Such
variation in cell types may well enhance the attractive-
ness of the corolla spot by dispersing light in diﬀerent
ways (Kay et al. 1981); the possibility that at least
some of the cells are also scent-secreting (osmophores)
cannot be excluded (Vogel 1990).
Our preliminary observations suggest that these cell
types are diﬀerentiated late in ﬂoral development,
shortly before anthesis, and are sometimes imperfectly
formed or even aborted. Similar (but less complex)
structures are also present in some related species, but
usually on all ﬂorets. Dark spots in the centre of the
ﬂower are also a feature of several other families, includ-
ing Papaveraceae (the poppy family) and Geraniaceae
(the pelargonium family), presumably with a similar
attractive function.
The evolution of adaptive petal cell morphology is po-
tentially rewarding ﬁeld for evo-devo studies. It is pos-
sible that a single gene might control the expression of
these beetle-like structures in the ray ﬂorets of Gorteria
diﬀusa. Timing of development of the ray ﬂorets, which
are zygomorphic, relative to the central (distal) acti-
nomorphic disk ﬂorets may be a factor in such expres-
sion (Gillies et al. 2002). In Antirrhinum, diﬀerentia-
tion of specialised conical-papillate cells results from ex-
pression of the MIXTA gene late in petal development,
although this is itself dependent on earlier expression
of the B-function genes DEFICIENS and GLOBOSA
(Glover and Martin 2002). Orthologs of MIXTA may
therefore represent potential candidates for the ’beetle
identity gene’ in Gorteria diﬀusa.
The project will aim to:
1. Phylogeny and phylogeography - Study the evolution
of the pollination ’beetle’ clues in a phylogenetic frame-
work by producing a broad molecular phylogenetic hy-
pothesis for the tribe Arctotideae (especially Berkheya,
Cullumia, Heterorhachis, Didelta, Cuspidia, Gundelia,
Gorteria, Hirpicium and Gazania). A morphology-
based phylogenetic trees of Arctotideae-Gorteriinae has
been produced by Per Ola Karis from Stockholm Uni-
versity and a preliminary molecular-based phylogenetic
is in press in Taxon (Funk et al.; ITS trnL-F; ndhF).
As Gorteria diﬀusa also shows geographic variationand potential diﬀerential pollination behaviour (cur-
rent ﬁeld study Jeremy Midgley and Steve Johnson),
it is aimed to produce a phylogeographical study (e.g.
AFLP DNA ﬁngerprinting) to be compared with polli-
nation data. Collaborators: Per Ola Karis (with Nigel
Barker), Jeremy Midgley and Steve Johnson. 2. Carry
out a detailed comparative investigation of the struc-
ture and ontogeny of both (a) the peculiar ’beetle’
structures, building on previous work by Johnson and
Midley (1997) and a pilot study done at Kew, and (b)
’normal’ dark spots in ray ﬂorets of other Asteraceae.
3. Aim towards identifying the ’beetle identity gene’
by identifying orthologous sequences of MIXTA (Antir-
rhinum) and PhMYB1 (Petunia) in Gorteria and per-
form micro RT PCR at critical developmental stages.

Helsinki Dispersal theory
POST GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP IN MATHEMAT-
ICAL BIOLOGY IN HELSINKI, FINLAND
Statisticians / mathematicians / biologists with strong
modeling background are invited to apply for a three-
year post graduate fellowship, which is available from
August 2004 onwards in the Metapopulation Re-
search Group ( www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop ), De-
partment of Biological and Environmental Sciences,
University of Helsinki, Finland. Monthly salary is ca.
1800 EUR.
The PhD project is aimed at developing methods for
analyzing mark-recapture data collected from hetero-
geneous landscapes. The project involves 1) develop-
ment of dispersal models, 2) development of Bayesian
methods for parameter estimation, and 3) applications
to existing butterﬂy data sets.
The project stems from a dispersal model that we have
developed earlier (Ovaskainen 2004; Ecology 85, 242-
257). The model is based on a diﬀusion approxima-
tion of random walk including edge-mediated behavior,
and it applies to heterogeneous landscapes. The PhD
project is aimed at incorporating several biologically
motivated extensions, including 1) co-variates such as
environmental conditions, 2) variation between individ-
uals, 3) linear landscape elements such as road-sides
and brooks, 4) applications employing trapping data
and radio-tracking data.
The project involves programming with C++, the
knowledge of which is counted as an advantage.
Applications including a short CV and two letters ofJune 1, 2004 EvolDir 9
reference should be submitted by 30 June 2004 to Dr..

UGroningen SeychellesWarbler
PhD on parasites in the Seychelles warbler
Gastrointestinal parasites, MHC genes and ﬁtness in a
wild avian population
Within vertebrates, the major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) genes within an individual determine how
well it copes with the array of parasites it encoun-
ters in its environment. An individuals ﬁtness (sur-
vival and reproductive success) will therefore, at least
in part, depend upon the MHC genes it contains. Gas-
trointestinal parasites (GI) occur worldwide and can
be extremely detrimental to the ﬁtness of individuals.
Few studies have assessed the impact of GI parasites
from an evolutionary perspective, and even fewer have
taken into account the aﬀect of the MHC. None have
done so using birds. This project will investigate the
aﬀect of GI parasites and their interaction with the
MHC in the simple and isolated system provided by the
Cousin Island population of Seychelles warbler (Acro-
cephalus sechellensis). PCR-based molecular protocols
will be used to screen MHC, while microscopic inves-
tigation of eggs within faecal samples will provide a
non-invasive method for determining the intensity of
GI parasites within individuals. Fieldwork to continue
the population monitoring and the collection of samples
and ﬁtness data will be done in conjunction with theJune 1, 2004 EvolDir 11
Seychelles warbler research project team. The results
will contribute towards determining the importance of
MHC variation and parasite-mediated selection in wild
animal populations.
Dr David S. Richardson and Prof. Jan Komdeur:
Jointly funded by UEA and JK (University of Gronin-
gen, Holland) for three years starting January 2005.
Further details
We are looking for an enthusiastic, dedicated and re-
silient student with an interest in evolutionary and
molecular ecology. The student will spend a large part
of their time in the laboratory, isolating parasite eggs
from faeces, extracting DNA and using basic molec-
ular techniques such as PCR and DGGE. Therefore,
although not essential, molecular lab experience will be
an advantage, as will good organisational skills. Field-
work will be for 2-3 months per year and, as the ﬁeld
site is small and isolated, the student must be able to
work well independently, or within a small group. The
studentship will be based at UEA with D. S. Richard-
son, but will visit Groningen each year.
This PhD is being re-advertised as the start date has
now been delayed until January 2005. Previous appli-
cants do not need to reapply. Although there is no
oﬃcial deadline please apply ASAP. We expect to in-
terview candidates in early September

ULondon KinSelection
PhD Studentship: WHY SUBJECT YOUR KIN TO

KIN SELECTION IN TWO IMPORTANT PEST
SPECIES
Supervisors: Drs Peter Credland and Robert J.H.
Payne School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway
college, University of London Application deadline 11th
June 2004.
Applicants must have 1st or upper 2nd class degree or
equivalent, which should be in either biology or in any
numerate discipline (mathematics, physics etc). Only
open to UK citizens or those resident in UK for past
three years. The project will combine laboratory in-
vestigation and modelling of the costs and beneﬁts of
aspects of beetle egg-laying behaviour. The project will
train the student in experimental design, insect culture
and handling techniques, data collection and statistical
analysis. Students with the relevant background may
also learn how to develop and analysis relevant mathe-
matical models.
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE. Seed beetles
(Bruchidae) are economically important pests of stored
seeds in most tropical and temperate areas of the world.
The egg-laying behaviour of the Bruchidae depends not
only on the species type, but also on the size and type
of host seed, and on local population density. Females
of Zabrotes subfasciatus lay eggs in a notably more
clumped and non-uniform manner than those of Cal-
losobruchus maculatus. The degree to which females
avoid already occupied seeds also varies, and appears to
be mediated by pheromones on the eggs. Understand-
ing such behavioural diﬀerences between species will be
an important aid in predicting the ecological responses
of the beetles to possible future changes in environment,
seed storage methods, or biocontrol practices. On a
practical level, knowledge of individual-level behaviour
is useful because it can be used to construct population-
level models of population ecology. This can be key in
designing biocontrol measures, which often lead to un-
foreseen consequences, particularly when target organ-
isms display contingent behaviours. On a more purely
scientiﬁc level, comparison of these two species will al-12 EvolDir June 1, 2004
low an investigation of fundamental ideas concerning
cooperation and conﬂict between related individuals,
and of parent-oﬀspring conﬂict.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS. This project will de-
velop understanding of the interaction between kin se-
lection and kin competition in two economically impor-
tant species that infest stored seed. The starting point
will be to seek to explain why females of the mexi-
can bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus lay their eggs in
clumped groups on only a small proportion of avail-
able seeds, whereas females of Callosobruchus macula-
tus generally avoid laying eggs on seeds that already
bear other eggs. A number of diﬀerent costs and bene-
ﬁts will need to be examined. On one hand it is costly to
females to spend time checking the status of potential
host seeds, but on the other hand it is costly to larvae
to have to compete with other larvae for occupation of
a seed. How then do we reconcile the interests and rel-
ative costs to the parent and its oﬀspring? The project
will examine how these costs diﬀer between species, and
how they vary depending on the type and size of host
seed. It is expected that larval competitiveness should
be greater where host seeds are smaller, where popu-
lation density is higher, where the amount of limiting
resource is lower, and where relatedness between co-
residents is lower. Can we use this to explain why Z.
subfasciatus lays its eggs in clumps? Could it be be-
cause larvae of Z. subfasciatus are more related than
those of C. maculatus? Could it perhaps be a form
of anti-parasite behaviour, analogous to anti-predator
ﬂocking in birds? Do egg-laying patterns determine
levels of larval competiveness, or vice versa?

A NERC PhD studentship is available at the University
of St Andrews for a joint project between the labora-
tories of Prof. M. G. Ritchie (St Andrews) and DrStephen Goodwin (University of Glasgow). The aims
of the project are to combine an evolutionary approach
to the evolution of song diﬀerences amongst species
of Drosophila with molecular and neurogenetic ap-
proaches to behaviour genetics. Quantitative Trait Loci
approaches have identiﬁed chromosomal regions impli-
cated in the evolution of species-speciﬁc song traits
important to speciation. Candidate genes previously
known to inﬂuence song are implicated in some of
these regions. The student will assess the role of can-
didate genes directly using modern behaviour genetic
techniques such as gene knockout or transfer between
species and the molecular evolution of the genes will be
analysed by sequence analysis. This project has the po-
tential to provide breakthroughs in the understanding
of the genetics of species diﬀerences in behaviour. Fur-

UWellington tuatura skinks
Two PhD Scholarships School of Biological Sciences,
Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand
1: Field studies of behaviour and reproduction of tu-
atara (Reptilia: Sphenodon punctatus)
As part of multidisciplinary eﬀorts to conserve tuatara
populations in New Zealand, and to gather informa-
tion on population biology, behavioural ecology and ge-
netics, a PhD scholarship is available for work on the
mating system, mate choice, ranging behaviour, and re-
productive strategies of this unique reptile. Fieldwork
will involve repeated stays (1-2 months in duration) on
Stephens Island, Cook Strait. A dense tuatara popula-
tion exists on the island, and there is a ﬁeld research
station, housing, and an excellent infrastructure to sup-
port the project, both in the ﬁeld and at the University.
Applications should be sent to Dr Nicola Nelson, School
of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Welling-
ton, PO Box 600, Wellington, New Zealand (E-mail:
Nicola.Nelson@vuw.ac.nz, Phone +64 4 463 7443, Fax:

2: The evolution of New Zealand skinks
The aim of this project is to construct a complete phy-14 EvolDir June 1, 2004
logeny of the New Zealand skinks. The New Zealand
skinks are an endemic group comprising two genera,
Oligosoma and Cyclodina, and as many as 40 species.
This group is thought to have radiated rapidly as a re-
sponse to changes in the New Zealand landscape since
the Oligocene. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA se-
quences will be used to place the New Zealand skinks
into the international ’Tree of Life’ project. When a ro-
bust phylogenetic tree has been established, it will be
used to test a series of hypotheses about the mode of
skink evolution in New Zealand. For example, some
cryptic species may have evolved as recently as the
Holocene through isolation on oﬀshore islands after the
last glacial maximum. The methodology for this re-
search project would involve identifying appropriate mi-
tochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, DNA sequenc-
ing and phylogenetic analyses. The successful appli-
cant would conduct their research in the School of Bi-
ological Sciences at Victoria University. The ideal stu-
dent would have an interest in vertebrate evolution
and molecular phylogenetics, and be able to develop
the project with their own ideas and initiative. Ap-
plications should be sent to Dr Peter Ritchie, School

Ph D position on “Coevolution in slavemaking ants and
their hosts”
The position is available beginning from July 1st 2004for 11
2years (renewable) at the LM University in Mu-
nich, Department Biology II, Behavioral Ecology group
Social parasites exploit similar to avian brood parasites
the brood care behaviour of their host species and espe-
cially slavemaking ants such as Protomognathus ameri-
canus obligatory depend on their hosts throughout their
life. This can lead to tight evolutionary interactions be-
tween slavemaking and host populations, the intensity
of which depends on parasite pressure and the com-
munity structure. The coevolutionary dynamics be-
tween social parasites and their hosts are studied in this
project on a North American model system in respect to
behavioral adaptations, ecological impact and the pop-
ulation genetic background. The successful candidate
should have a solid background in behavioral ecology
and be interested to use a variety of approaches such as
genetic, chemical, ecological and behavioural methods.
Longer ﬁeld stays in the US and Canada are required
for this project. The laboratory is based at the new

Allozyme applicators
Dear EVOLDIR members,Although molecular tools are now the reference for pop-
ulation genetics, allozyme electrophoresis still consti-
tutes an easy and useful tool for comparative purposes.
We have been using Cellulose Acetate gels since years
with good results, only experiencing problems with the
quality of the supernatant applicator we are buying. It
seems that the quality is not very good (breaking comb,June 1, 2004 EvolDir 25
bad ﬁnishing, etc), so I was wondering what kind of al-
lozyme applicators are used nowadays for CAGE and
what their users ﬁnd of the quality. For the moder-
ate sum of around 500 , one can expect that it would
at least last for several months/years ! We are cur-
rently purchasing an applicator from Helena Labora-
tories (model HL 4090) for 7 cm X 7 cm gels with 12
platina combs.
In summary: What companies deliver such applicators,
what is their quality and for what price ?
I thank you in advance for you replies
sincerely,
Gregory Maes

Bird Blood DNA
Dear all,
We are considering the purchase of a liquid handling
robot. One of the tasks that we have in mind is ex-
traction of genomic DNA from bird blood and tissue in
96-well plates. Magnetic beads and vacuum based pro-
tocols seem to be the two main techniques available.
Does anyone have experience with bird blood and ei-
ther of these approaches on a liquid handling robot?
What are the respective dis-/advantages? One partic-
ular concern we have is the viscosity typical for bird
blood in lysis buﬀer. Is the vacuum strong enough to
draw the samples through?
We would appreciate any insights and advice you might
have.
Many thanks,

BloodSmear extraction
Hello, everyone, I am planning to extract DNA from air
dried blood smears (from toads) on microscopic slides
(10-12 years old). Although I have several ideas, I
am wondering whether people have some experiences.
Also, some (of course, the most important ones) were
mounted with xylene based medium and may be not
suitable for extraction at all? Thanks for your ideas,

ANSWERS:
Hi I have done a lot of work on archival slides that date
back over 70 years. Mostly I have been recovering hu-
man mtDNA and nuDNA, but I also have had some
success with some plasmodium DNA out of slides go-
ing back to the 1930’s Actually, odd as it may sound, I
ﬁnd the best way to get DNA out of them (I have com-
pared about 10 methods), is simply to use some very
dilute SDS. Typically I pipette about 35-50ul of 0.002%
SDS onto the slide, and scrape around/suck it up and
down with the pipette. You can then pcr straight onthis, although I ﬁnd it also helps to freeze and thaw
it ﬁrst. Of course, once you have done this, store the
samples in the freezer. As far as I can tell, the SDS
simply helps getting up the old material by acting as a
detergent. I should probably mention that all my sam-
ples are Giemsa stained, and a mixture of methanol
and non-methanol ﬁxed. But I doubt it will make any
diﬀerence if they are not stained. As for the ones with
cover slips, you need to remove them ﬁrst by bathing
them in xylene. But they are a real pain in the arse,
as you have to watch for cross contamination between
samples, so each needs an individual bath, so I would
stick with the non-slipped ones if possible. One further
bit of advice - I ﬁnd that getting mtDNA is easy from
these extracts, but the fragments are limited to short
lenght - typically less than 500bp (although my sam-
ples are a lot older than yours). As for nuclear, I again
have most success with short frags (ie below 250bp).
However the degradation is linked to a load of factors,
so it is hard to generalise. So to summarize, I would
recommend simply trying my simple method (modiﬁed
from another paper I can ref for you if you want), and
try some nice small amps to start with. Let me know
if you need more advice Tom Gilbert
Also I forgot to mention that I always use the (exhorbi-
tantly priced) platinum taq hiﬁdelity from Invitrogen,
which is way more sensitive than any other enzyme I
have tried. So my hints may be less successful if you
are using other enzymes - although I expect that In-
vitrogen’s cheaper option, platinum taq, may be just
as good. As before though, it will all depend on the
preservation of your DNA.
If you are interested, I do 25ul reactions with
2.5 ul 10X 1ul 50mM MgSO4 1-2 ul 10uM each primer
up to 3ul of the SDS extract (depends if you are after
mtDNA or nuDNA) 0.2ul 25mM DNTPS 0.2ul Enzyme
DDH2O up to 25ul
And then give the reaction 40 cycles. You may note
that I use a lot of primer. When I worked with an-
cient DNA, we always found that using large amounts
of primer helped - basically as far as I can see, the more
primer, the more chance of it binding to the limited
number of template molecules there are in an ancient
extract.
One last thing, you may or may not know this (and
forgive me if I am lecturing unnecessarily), but be re-
ally careful of contamination. You will have pretty low
levels of DNA in your slides compared to any modern
samples, or any DNA in the environment from previous
PCRs on the target regions. It is exceedingly easy to get
results from the samples if this is the case....although
they may well be results of contamination. If possibleJune 1, 2004 EvolDir 27
I would recommend doing the ’extractions’ and PCR
set up somewhere well away from anywhere where you
play with modern DNA, and analyse PCR products.
Well away being in a diﬀerent room at least, build-
ing better. Contamination is a real persistent bugger.
Also the problem is worsened if you use the enzymes I
mention, because they are so sensitive to copy number,
they often pick up traces of contaminatino that other
enzymes don’t amplify. But again, all this is dependent
on copy number of the original extract vs other sources
of DNA. Hope this is helpful Tom Tom Gilbert Ecology

blood smears from lizards many times with very lim-
ited success. I think the only time I was successful
(though mind you I was amplifying parasite DNA so
something even rarer than host DNA) was on a very
young ( <2 yr old) smear. If slides are unstained and
un-cover-slipped, they do work a little better. My two
recommendations are to use Qiagen kits and elute in a
very small volume (or

Cloning problems
Hi Everyone,
I have another kind of problem! From the RNA, cDNA
is prepared and then cloning into T-vector as well as di-
rect expression vector ( vaccinia virus vector with dual
prpmoter) tried. In the expression vector, the positive
clones are observed by colony pcr which is then follwed
with miniprep and digestion. Digested plasmid shows
the correct insert size but a smaller fragment of the vec-
tor backbone. Using a recombinant-deﬁcient competent
cells the results are still the same. Well, my insert is
cloned using a single enzyme ie., the same enzyme on
both ends. If anybody could help, please kindly send
me a message.

Eﬀective Pop Size
Hello everyone,
I need to calculate eﬀective population sizes (Ne)
based on temporal variation in allele frequencies at mi-
crosatellite loci. Since these calculations involve multi-
ple loci and several alleles per locus, it may be diﬃcult
doing it by hand. Do you know of a software that I can28 EvolDir June 1, 2004
use for this purpose?
I welcome any suggestions on how to calculate Ne from
microsatellite data.
Thanks,
Johnson

Hi everyone,
Here are the responses I received for my question on
how to calculate Ne. I have compiled all the answers
for the sake of those who may ﬁnd them useful. Thanks

try this - have not tried it
New software (NeEstimator) is available for free
download from http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/ﬁshweb/-
11629.html NeEstimator software estimates eﬀective
population sizes (Ne) from allele frequency data. The
user can estimate Ne using any of the three internal
methods or three third party programs. Genotypes
from a sample of the population are used as input. The
user provides this data in GENEPOP, ARLEQUIN or
simple column (eg. saved as a tab delimited text ﬁle
from Microsoft Excel) format.
The three internal methods are as follows.
* A point estimation method using linkage/gametic
disequilibrium, (Hill, 1981). * A point estimation
method using heterozygote excess (Pudovkin, Zaykin
and Hedgecock, 1996). * A temporal method using mo-
ments based F-statistics (Krimbas and Tsakas, 1971;
Nei and Tajima, 1981; Pollock, 1983 or Waples, 1989).
The elapsed number of generations between temporal
samples is required.
The three third party programs that NeEstimator isable to utilise are as follows.
* A temporal method using a Bayesian based approach
called TM3 ( http://www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/ ˜ mab/-
software.html ). * A temporal method using a
maximum likelihood based approach called MCLEEPS
(http://www.stat.washington.edu/thompson/Genepi/-
Mcleeps.shtml ). * A temporal method using a
pseudo likelihood approach called MLNE ( http://-
www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/ioz/people/wang.htm ).
I guess you can use Fluctuate. It is free
software and you can get it from http:/-
/evolution.genetics.washington.edu/lamarc/-
ﬂuctuate.html I havent use it on Microsatellites
but I guess you can do it. However I am not sure if
it is available for Windows, but if you have a Mac it
works ﬁne. Vera I don’t know of any speciﬁc software,
but I’ve been working on a related problem (estimating
the amount of variation in selection from genotype
frequency time series). It would be almost trivial to
adapt the code for your problem.
If you are familiar with the WinBugs software (or if
you can ﬁnd someone who is, and is willing to help), I
can re-write my code and send it to you. Alternatively,
you could send me the data and I run it. The former is
preferable - you’ll get a better understanding of what’s
being done (and it’s less work for me!).

ing several methods is NeEstimator available at http:/-

Arlequin ( http://lgb.unige.ch/arlequin/ ) can get you
good theta estimates from populations, from SNPs or
from microsattelite data. So, if you happen to have
a way to estimate your mutation rate, you can get an
idea of the eﬀective population size. Even if you don’t
know the mutation rate, if there’s reason to assume that
it’s relatively constant throughout your time frame, you
can still get relative values of Ne from the thetas. -Mike
Wiser
you might look at a program called “Estim” (Vi-
talis&Couvet, 2001 Mole Ecol Notes). Also,
Williamson&Slatkin 1999 Genetics might be a good
place to start for entry into that literature. If you do a
citation search (to see who has cited this article), there
are lots of refs regarding this topic. Cheers, Charles

hello all.
my lab is currently trying to setup our 3730xl sequencer
to do microsatellite genotyping. we currently only have
the 50cm array, and would like to run it 96 wells at

means paying a huge sum to abi, and we feel we have
paid enough to them.
has anyone had any success genotyping microsats on a

Human evolution infoOur students have to conclude their four years biology
course by writing a small monography-like concluding
thesis/text. One of my students chose to write about
human evolution. I happened to gave her a small pa-
perback “Why sex is fun - the evolution of human sex-
uality” by Jared Diammond.
In the meanwhile this particular student made thoughts
of his own and she came out with the proposal to write
a text primarily about the following species:
1.) Australopithecus africanus 2.) Australopithecus ro-
bustus 3.) Homo erectus 4.) Homo habilis 5.) Homo
sapiens
Now she wants to know wether there are particular es-
says, on-line publications, papers, et cetera, which deal
with questions of sexual dimorphism, sexual selection,
and evolution of sexuality in general in those already
chosen ﬁve species, topic of her concluding essay?

Insect preservation answers
Thanks to everyone who responded to my inquiry about
shippng insects for DNA extraction without the use
of ethanol! I’ve posted most of the responses below.
DMSO preservation sounds like something to try in the
future, but unfortunately I didn’t have time to try it
with my weevil larvae. I decided to go with initial
preservation in ethanol. Then, just before shipping,
pour oﬀ the ethanol, cotton stop the vials and place
them in a bag with silica gel desiccant. I’m hoping this
works. There were a few other suggestions especially
worth looking into (ie. RNAlater and FTA cards by
Whatman) Thanks again, everybody! Steve
Query: >Does anyone have suggestions for preserva-
tives other than ethanol for >shipping insects to be
used in genetic work? (regulations on ethanol are
>making it diﬃcult to ship)
Responses: I have successfully carried samples in vials
over silica gel to dessicate them. This has produced
DNA extractions and PCR bands as good or better
than sample from 100% ethanol, although the morpho-June 1, 2004 EvolDir 31
logical features don’t preserve well (e.g., setae are lost,
wings get bent), if that is important.
Here is a recipe that we used to preserve ﬁsh eggs for
DNA analysis. This seems to work best with copious
amounts of buﬀer compared to the amount of material
to be preserved (We would put about 50-100 ﬁsh eggs in
a 50mL Falcon Tube). I have not used it for insects but
it might be worth experimenting with. DMSO Preser-
vation Buﬀer, pH 7.5 250mM EDTA (disodium) 20%
DMSO saturated NaCl to make 1 liter 93.05 g EDTA
200 ml DMSO ~200 g NaCl pH to about 8.5 before
adding NaCl to get the EDTA into solution (we use
NaOH). Add the NaCl (warming helps salt go into so-
lution) pH to 7.5 (we use HCl)
I have collected insects in the ﬁeld straight into silica
gel. These were then used for molecular analyses, but I
only ampliﬁed a rather short bit of mitochondrial 12S.
I switched to 100% ethanol shortly after so did not do
anything more with this material. But I did success-
fully extract the DNA after storing in silica gel at -20
for several months. Also the insects I work with are
small - 2-3mm - it may be diﬀerent with larger insects.
I don’t know how far you are shipping the insects.
However, I did a lot of genetics work on ﬂeas here at
northern arizona university and I stored them for long
amounts of time in a -80 freezer without any liquid. I
would think that if you shipped them on dry ice, they
would survive the journey ﬁne.
Simple dessication seems to work quite well in terms of
preserving insect DNA. I did a project on butterﬂies us-
ing museum specimens and was able to amplify mtDNA
from specimens that were up to 100 years old. However,
some of the more recent specimens ( ~20 years) did not
amplify at all. I suspect it has a lot to do with the
speed at which specimens are preserved. If a freshly
collected insect is killed and dried rapidly, there is less
opportunity for degradation.
I know what you mean...shipping regulations have be-
gun to make things diﬃcult for us. Lately, I’ve been
shipping insects for genetic research by pouring oﬀ the
excess EtOH from each specimen vial, and shipping the
vials in a styrofoam cooler with icepacks. My speci-
mens are all kept at -80, and remain frozen until time
of shipping; even after the excess EtOH is removed,
the specimen tissues are saturated with ethanol, and so
seem to be ﬁne if shipped via overnight delivery and
kept cold. It might be overkill, but I also tend to coor-
dinate closely with the recipient, telling them exactly
when the specimens are shipped, when to expect deliv-
ery, and providing shipment tracking numbers. So far,
this has worked well for us.....Maybe DNAzol could be useful. But we haven’t tried
it yet in our analysis.
FTA cards made by Whatman will likely work (What-
man catalogue pages 116-119 for products and an out-
line of the procedure). They are also extremely easy to
work with after sample collection, eg shipping, storage,
extraction for PCR. I have not yet used them myself
(but plan to soon); a colleague just tried them out (on
tomatoes, but these cards are VERY versatile) and was
very satisﬁed with the results.
I’ve shipped mammals that were collected in ethanol
by draining most of the ethanol but leaving the sam-
ples soaked in the stuﬀ. I have to add that we were
transporting them in our luggage, so it didn’t take long
before we could add new ethanol. We experienced no
trouble, but regulations or baggage checks in e.g. the
US might be stricter.
Just the usual suggestions of dry ice or extract & ship
the DNA.
An excellent alternative to ethanol for preserving in-
sects (either for shipment or long term storage) is salt-
saturated DMSO (usually 20-30% salt content).
we’ve had good luck with insects in RNA later, though
I don’t know what, if any, shipping restrictions there
might be on it. I’ve also been interested

Multiple matingsJune 1, 2004 EvolDir 33
Dear colleagues,
I am investigating an ant species where I suspect that
the queen has mated more than twice. I suspect this
from preliminary microsatellite analyses of the contents
of the spermathecae. The question then arises as how
to statistically verify that this is the case - does anyone
know a (maximum likelihood/bayesian/other) program
that will estimate the number of males that a single fe-
male has mated with (without having to genotype her
progeny).
Many thanks in advance, Andrea.

PCR cloning
Hi! Everybody,
Here I have a question to ask for your help. One of my
friends met a problem in PCR product cloning which
he never met before. He inserted PCR products into T-
vector and transformed E. coli, then plated on solid me-
dia, no problem. But when white colonies were picked
into liquid media for culture, these E. coli seem did
not grow at all. When transferring white colonies into
other plates, it was ok. He checked media, antibiotics
etc, seems no problem. He also tried other people’s me-
dia by picking white clones into their liquid media, the
same thing happened, no growth. It seems E. coli had
problem. But the cells grew well before transformation.
Does anybody meet this kind problem before? What
could be the causes for the problem?
He is working on ITS of invertebrate species. To checkintra-individual (within individual) variation, sequenc-
ing of individual colonies is necessary. In this situation,
what other ways could be taken for sequencing of indi-
vidual colonies, if E. coli prove not to be the problem?
If anybody could help, please kindly send me a message

follows before we go on. Once again, thank you all who
responded to my inquiry, I appreciate it.

Answers:
(1)That’s a strange situation indeed! If the bacteria
simply refuse to grow in liquid culture, then it should
still be possible to sequence clones. I have had gener-
ally good success with PCR ampliﬁcation and sequenc-
ing of single colonies of bacteria using primers from the
T-vector that ﬂank the insert site. To get the template
DNA, transfer part of the colony into 50 uL of water in
a microcentrifuge tube, and vortex.
(2)I would suggest that you PCR directly from the indi-
vidual colonies growing on the solid media (either with
ITS or vector primers) to amplify the ITS copy that has
been inserted. If you use a cocktail stick to LIGHTLY
touch a single colony and then drop that into a PCR
mix, stir gently and remove it should amplify ﬁne. Then
just clean-up the PCR product and sequence. If you
want to be able to return to these speciﬁc colonies at
a later date (but within a few weeks), then streak out
the individual white colonies onto new solid media, la-
bel them and grow them up overnight before you begin
to PCR from them.
(3)You do not have to culture the bacteria. You can
just do PCR directly from individual colonies, and then
sequence the products. People routinely do this in my
lab. You can use universal M13 seuqencing primers as
PCR and sequencing primers.
(4)I had a problem when i started my phd in that some-
one had done some cloning but the clones were old and
had died. As you know its expensive to clone, so i
tried to sequence these anyway, and had good success.
Firstly i scraped a small amount of dead cells from the
plate and carried out a pcr using universal M13 primers
and ran them out on a gel. Most clones i tried PCRd
successfully. I then did a 1:100 or 1:200 dilution and
re-PCRd in the smae way. I then carried out a normal
clean-up (Wizard preps) and sequenced as per a normal
sample.
(5)I would pick colonies, dilute them and use them as a
template for PCR and then sequence the PCR product
directly.
(6)I have not experienced the problem you are describ-
ing but I can tell you a way to get out of growing the
clones up in broth prior to sequencing. We directly se-
quence clones by the method I have attached. It has
saved us a great deal of time when we have had hun-
dred’s of clones to sequence.
(7)Why not do PCR on clones, and sequence the PCR
product?(just set up a pcr as usual, with internal or
universal primers, and stick a pipette tip into a colonyto pick up some bacteria, place the tip intothe pcr coc-
tail and pipette up and down a few times to get bacteria
intothe tube, put on thermocycler with normal condi-
tions, except increase thedenature time before the ﬁrst

at 95C at the beginning of the ﬁrst cycle to denature
someenzymes in the bacteria. Your friend should check
the literature of thecloning kit he is using (if using a
kit) to see if they have a recommendation.Then you
use a kit to purify the pcr rxn and sequence. He can
sequence several clones in this way.

PCR inhibition
Hi everyone,
I have a problem doing pcrs on mtDNA extracted from
lion dung. I did lots of (hotstart) pcrs on dung sam-
ples and never had problems. Now, I have got lots of
clean dna from one sample (big pellet), but I am un-
able to do a pcr on it. I think because there are too
much small DNA fragments ( <50 bp) competing with
the primers for TAQ. After PCR these fragments are
very! clearly visible with etbr staining. I ﬁrst confused
it with primer dimers. Diluting does not work, as I will
then also dilute my mtDNA.
My question: is there a convenient way to separate
small fragments ( <1000 - <50 bp) from the rest of
the DNA sample)?
Kind regards, Dr. Pim van Hooft University of Antwerp

PCR primer kits
Hi,
Does anyone know of a source for PCR primer kits for
Anopheles mosquitoes (or other Diptera for that mat-
ter) that I could use to amplify genes from Chironomi-
dae? I’d like to get as many nuclear genes as possible.
I appreciate any suggestions, and also I apologize if you
get this message more than once.

Pandit database
We are pleased the announce the release of Pandit ver-
sion 12.0, freely available via http://www.ebi.ac.uk/-
goldman-srv/pandit . Pandit is a collection of multi-
ple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees cover-
ing many common protein domains. For each of 7226
families, the data available includes:
* a protein sequence multiple alignment, * a corre-
sponding nucleotide sequence alignment * inferred phy-
logenetic trees derived from each alignment
We can imagine many uses for this database, but we
are particularly optimistic that it will help in the de-
vising of improved mathematical models of amino acid
and codon sequence evolution and for investigation of
the eﬀects of selection on protein sequence evolution.
Pandit is derived from the Pfam database of
protein family alignments and HMMs ( http://-
www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam ).

Hello everyone
I’m trying to make a DNA-sequence based phylogenetic
reconstruction under the last version of PAUP(4.0b10)
and I have a little problem. When I choose the Maxi-
mum Likelihood criterion with Bootstrap as resampling
method and full Heuristic as type of search the program
does not allow me to save as many best scored trees as I
want (the option “keep N best trees” is unavailable, the
“best tree only” option is the only one available, hence
only saves the best tree). May be I’m assuming search
options so the program doesn’t allow me to choose this
option. Any helpful comment will be appreciated.
Thank you all. Best for everyone

Pseudogene phylogeny answers
Dear Members,
Thank you very much to everyone who replied to my
inquiry. Because I received a number of requests for
responses, I have compiled them below.
I hope that I received all of your replies. Our server
was hit by a virus soon after I posted my question and
was shut down for several days. My apologies to those
who replied but are not listed.
Thanks again, Deb
My initial query:
I have a set of mitochondrial sequences and their cor-
responding nuclear pseudogene sequences from several
vole species that I would like to use to construct a phy-
logeny. I have compared mitochondrial cytochrome b
sequences to their nuclear pseudogenes and have found
that the mitochondrial sequences are evolving more
rapidly. Rather than constructing a tree for each se-
quence type and comparing the resultant topologies, I
would like to incorporate them all into one tree but am
not sure of methods that will account for the diﬀerences
in their modes of evolution. I understand how to ﬁnd
appropriate models of substitution for a particular set
of sequences using software like PAUP* and Modeltest.
I am also aware of partitioning models along sequences
as with Mr. Bayes software. However, is there a way
to incorporate diﬀerent, appropriate models to accom-
modate the extreme diﬀerences in evolution between
mitochondrial and nuclear sequences?
Responses:
A long time ago, before the advent of computers (well,
1996 anyway!) I was confronted with a similar situa-
tion. This is not a direct answer toyour question because I took a diﬀerent approach to
what you are suggesting, but you might ﬁnd it interest-
ing to compare the nuclear and
mtDNA suites of sequences in some of the same ways
that I did. You can download Sunnucks, P., & Hales,
D.F. (1996) Numerous transposed sequences
of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I-II in aphids of
the genus Sitobion (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Molecular
Biology & Evolution 13: 510-524.

—–
Try Ziheng Yangs program PAML. You can paste dif-
ferent genes end to = end in your alignment, assign
them diﬀerent models of sequence evolution and then
construct a single tree.
—– You might try a log-det transformation
—–
When I tried to resolve this issue a few years ago, using
PAUP* and PAML, I could ﬁnd nothing that would
partition branches into diﬀerent models of evolution.
I still constructed a phylogeny, but more to illustrate
the data than to be trusted. I found that parsimony
methods came out with the worst trees, the pseudogene
branches (which should have been relatively short)
were similar in length to the faster evolving mtDNA
and this changed the
tree topology. Maximum likelihood trees with neigh-
bour joining starting trees were better. In the end
I chose to use a relatively undetailed model of evolu-
tion (e.g. HKY85-type parameters), but erred on the
side of using the mtDNA-like parameters, because these
changes were more common than nuclear ones. The
nuclear mode of evolution would mostly have occurred
in the terminal branches, and would therefore be less
important for reconstructing ancestral states, or for de-
termining general topology.

heterogeneity in gene sequence or character-state data,

The software Hy-Phy allows you to do this sort of thing.
The web site is
http://www.hyphy.org/=20
—–
You could try it by performing an analysis with model-
test for each sequence (gene, locus, etc.) in order toJune 1, 2004 EvolDir 37
check what is the “best model” that ﬁts your data.
Then, perform the combined analysis of all the se-
quences following Yang models for combined analysis
with the more inclusive model (the most general model
ﬁtted to some of the sequences), incorporating the dif-
ferences in rates among loci (there is a variable in the
control ﬁle than accounts for it). You must perform a
separate analysis (considering separate estimations for
each loci) as well, and try to see if the topologies are
concordant. You must remember that genes are not
merely markers and that they can tell you about their
own histories. Then, for the combined analysis to be
useful, the tree that underlies each data set (each gene)
must be the same, even when the relative rates of evo-
lution and the rest of the parameter values are not the
same for all of them.

Relative rate test
Dear Evoldir members,
We are performing a relative rate test (on protein cod-
ing sequence) using two sequences (ca. 15% diverged)
versus a more divergent outgroup (ca. 25% diverged).
We are using the HyPhy computer package using the
following settings:
Goldman-Yang 1994 codon based model
Synonymous/non-synonymous rates independent
Gamma distribution with 4 rate classes
There are 4 independent parameters which are: -
mu = non-synonymous rate - R = synonymous/non-
synonymous ratio for the branch - kappa = trani-
tion/transversion ratio - alpha = the shape parameter
for the gamma distribution
The ﬁnal option is constraining either R, mu, or all
parameters.
I would basically like to know when it is appropriate to
constrain each of these three diﬀerent options.
Thanks for your help! Tracy MarstersPlease reply to: <c.van-oosterhout@hull.ac.uk >

Salmonid primers
Dear Colleagues
In an ongoing parentage study of hybridization between
Salmo marmoratus and Salmo trutta in Slovenia we are
in need of extra microsatellite loci to increase the conﬁ-
dence of our data. This is ﬁrst and foremost due to the
fact that the marble trout involved in the study show
very low levels of polymorphism. We would therefore
kindly ask you to take a look at the attached ﬁle which
contains the names of loci that we have already screened
for variation. If you have loci in your lab which are not
on the list below, we would be pleased if you could send
us a few aliquots of primer to test on our trout.
Thanks in advance

SequenceAlignment citations
Dear EvolDir readers,
Since June last year (when my new website went up),
over 1200 people have downloaded Se-Al, my manual
sequence alignment editor for the Macintosh:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software/seal/ I originally
wrote this program for my own use and so it is much
less polished than I would have liked. Unfortunately I
haven’t had time to update this program or even ﬁx a
number of bugs that I am aware of. Now we have plans
to get funding to produce a successor to Se-Al (and
the similar tool for PC, BioEdit) which will be cross-
platform. In order to do this I need to compile a list
of papers that cite Se-Al. Unfortunately as there is no
paper describing Se-Al, it is diﬃcult to do this directly
from the publication indices.
If any reader of EvolDir has cited Se-Al in their papers,
I would be immensely grateful if they could drop me an
email with a citation or citations of these papers.
Finally, if any really enthusiastic Se-Al users wishes to
email me a letter of support for further development,
these could be used to support the funding application.
Many thanks, Andrew

Dear Colleagues,
I am organizing an eﬀort to collect seeds of Arabidop-
sis thaliana with ecological information about the lo-
cal habitat. Initially this eﬀort was focused on North
America just because that is where most of us are based.
Currently, this has been expanded to at least coordinate
with eﬀorts in Europe and Central Asia. This project
is still in the planning stages, although we have been
starting to collect. This collection will diﬀer from the
current ecotypes as it will have information about the
local site and plants and it will have multiple maternal
sibships. I also have a list serv for this eﬀort and re-
lated matters. If you are interested in participating in

cDNA genomic alignment
Hello Evoldir
Does anyone know of a program that takes genomic
DNA (i.e. with non-coding DNA regions) and cDNA
as inputs, and gives aligned outputs (i.e. with exons
and introns)? Seems like many people are encountering
this problem, and the number will only increase. I canthink of several ways a program could do this, but I
have no idea how to code it.
On the same note, does anyone have a program that
takes a multi-fasta ﬁle and aligns all the sequences us-
ing tblastx rather than the clustal algorithm?

mtDNA nuclear markers
Dear everybody,
I am interested to know if it is possible to combine mito-
chondrial (RFLP) and nuclear (microsatellite) marker
data for constructing phylogenetic trees. If so, would
it be reasonable to include the mtDNA as four (identi-
cal) loci, in order to compensate for the diﬀerences in
eﬀective size of nuclear and maternally inherited loci.
Many thanks in advance!

Helsinki MathEcol
POST DOC POSITION IN MATHEMATICAL BIOL-
OGY IN HELSINKI, FINLAND
A two-year post doc position (with a possibility for a
one year extension) on mathematical biology is avail-
able from August 2004 onwards in the Metapopulation
Research Group ( www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop ),
Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences,
University of Helsinki, Finland. Monthly salary is ca.
2400 EUR. The PhD project is aimed at developing
mathematical methods for the analysis of spatial and
stochastic multi-species population models.
While theoretical ecologists have developed various
approaches to understand the roles that space and
stochasticity play in ecological systems, these ap-
proaches (including simulations, pair-approximations,
and spatial moment equations) have been at least partly
based on heuristic arguments. We aim at developing
a new general framework for the analysis of stochas-
tic and spatial systems, which is based on the theory
of distributions (to account for space) and on a sys-
tematic perturbation expansion (around a mean-ﬁeld
model) of the underlying stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tions (to account for noise). As a starting point, we
have applied the method to a Markov process that rep-
resents a single-species metapopulation inhabiting an
inﬁnitely large dynamic landscape. The results, which
characterize the spatio-temporal correlation structure
of the stationary state in an asymptotically exact man-
ner, are among the ﬁrst mathematically rigorous results
in theoretical ecology that relate to a stochastic model
with a non-trivial spatial structure.
The available project aims at applying the above de-
scribed modeling framework to multi-species models,
such as competition models and host-parasitoid mod-
els. The project provides an excellent opportunity for
a post doc who is interested in pursuing mathemati-cally challenging research with models that are highly
relevant for population biology.

Postdoc position Theoretical population genetics
“Interactions in evolutionary processes” Ludwig-
Maximilians-Universit¨ at (LMU) Munich
PROJECT
An Emmy Noether research grant from the German Re-
search Foundation (DFG) has been awarded to study
the role of epistasis (gene interactions) and gene-
environment interactions in evolutionary processes.
The overall goal of the project is to understand how
past evolution and environmental factors shape the
boundary conditions under which further evolution oc-
curs. Questions are asked on the molecular and the
quantitative genetic level and include the following:
* Molecular population genetics: How does epistasis
aﬀect rates of evolution? Adaptation after rapid en-
vironmental changes: How do footprints of selection
look like if selected alleles are taken from the standing
genetic variation? What is the distribution of selec-
tion coeﬃcients of adaptive substitutions in this case?
(Collaboration with Wolfgang Stephan and Allen Orr)
* Multilocus models of quantitative genetics: How
does epistasis aﬀect the genetic variation in mutation-
selection balance? How does the genetic architecture
of complex traits evolve? What maintains evolvability
of these traits? Is there a tendency for the evolution
of genetic robustness? What are the evolutionary con-
sequences of genetic robustness? Is there selection for
modularity of the genotype-phenotype map? (Collabo-
ration with Gunter Wagner and Thomas Hansen)
* Potential further topics include: Measurment of epis-
tasis from QTL data, Evolution of genetic buﬀering, ge-
netic diﬀerentiation, and phenotypic plasticity in struc-
tured environments, Evolution of mutational buﬀering
in clonal populations
... and there is a lot of room for your own ideas and
suggestions.
Problems are addressed by analytical approaches, sim-
ulation studies and data analysis. Contacts and collab-
orations have been established with:

gen Univ. Wilfried Gabriel, Munich Thomas Hansen,
FSU at Tallahassee Beate Nuernberger, Munich Allen
Orr, Rochester Wolfgang Stephan, Munich MichaelTurelli, UC Davis Gunter Wagner, Yale
QUALIFICATIONS

Stasis and change in the regulation of a master gene and
the evolution of morphological novelty in the arthro-
pods.
Applications are invited for a three-year, BBSRC-
funded post in the department of Biology.June 1, 2004 EvolDir 49
The research will involve cloning of genes from the
model crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, whose homologs
in Drosophila are involved in the regulation of expres-
sion of the leg-promoting gene, Distal-less (Dll). These
Parhyale genes will be assayed for a role in Dll reg-
ulation using in situ hybridisation, RNA interference
and using reporter constructs introduced into ﬂies and
Parhyale. Experience of molecular biology is essential,
knowledge of Drosophila genetics, in particular trans-
genesis, highly desirable as is an interest in animal evo-
lution.

programs funded by NSF in collaboration with the ALL
Species Foundation. Solanum includes between 1000
and 2000 species and is one of the largest genera of an-
giosperms. The species level taxonomy, including im-
ages, keys and specimen data, will be made available
over the Internet. Responsibilities include monographic
taxonomy of selected species groups of solanums; spec-
imen and image databasing and manipulation; ﬁeld
work for the collection of herbarium, seed and silica
gel samples; generation of molecular data for phylogeny
reconstruction (mainly sequences of chloroplast and nu-
clear genes); maintenance and analysis of living green-
house collections of Solanaceae; data analysis, presen-
tation, and publication; training and supervision of un-
dergraduate lab assistants; and oversight of routine lab
activities. Candidates should have a Ph.D. and experi-
ence in plant systematics, ﬁeld work and with working
in a team; experience with Solanaceae is preferred but

Dear Colleagues
This is an invitation to the course: Introduction to
Geometric Morphometrics. The course will be held at
the Universitat Aut` onoma de Barcelona, in Barcelona
(Spain), from 18 to 20 May.
Morphometrics is the study of shape variation in organ-
isms and its covariation with other variables. While the
traditional approaches are based on sets of distances
measurements, the geometric morphometric, uses land-
mark coordinates to capture the shape of the study
object and provides more powerful statistical tests for
diﬀerences in shape. This new method is needed and
used whenever we need to describe and compare shapes
of organisms or the shapes of particular structures. It
could be used for studying geographical eﬀects, devel-
opmental stages, genetic eﬀects, environmental eﬀects
etc. Thus it is useful for a broad category of students
in the ﬁelds of ecology, evolution, systematics, genet-
ics, medicine etc. Since it is a powerful tool in many
areas in biology it is very useful for inter disciplinary
research.
The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive
introduction in this area of research including both the-
oretical and practical aspects.

Seminar
15 -19 September, 2004 / La Fouly, Swiss Alps
?POLLINATION BIOLOGY: NEWS AND PERSPEC-
TIVES?
Organizers: Luc Gigord, J´ erˆ ome Goudet, Ian Sanders
& Nicole Galland
Theme: Plants are fundamentally diﬀerent from ani-
mals in many life traits. In particular, they cannot
move around to search for a partner or mate. How do
plants overcome this problem? As a consequence, mostﬂowering plants rely on animals (insects, birds, mam-
mals or reptiles) to ensure male gamete transfer (pollen)
to female receptacle organs. Not only is pollination bi-
ology economically important, generating up to $20 bil-
lion annually, but oﬀers the possibility to study a num-
ber of evolutionary and ecological approaches such as
hybridisation, population genetic structure, animal be-
haviour, co-evolution, mimicry, adaptive radiation and
speciation. These topics will be treated by several in-
ternationally renowned scientists. PhD students and
postdocs will have the opportunity during the workshop
of developing, discussing and presenting their own re-
search and ideas as well as working together in groups
on particular topics of interest.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
