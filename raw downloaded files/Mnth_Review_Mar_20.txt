Due to uncertainties regarding COVID19, we plan to ex-
tend the abstract submission and registration deadlines
for MASAMB 2020.
For recent updates, or if you have questions about the
event, please use #masamb2020 on twitter or email
ssolo@elte.hu!
The 30th Workshop on Mathematical and Statistical
Aspects of Molecular Biology (MASAMB) will be held
in Budapest on April 18 and 19, 2020.
For details see http://masamb2020.elte.hu and below.
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running series of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression, pro-
teomic, metabolomic and single-cell genomics technolo-
gies. These immense data resources, and the underlying
complexities of molecular and cell biology, provide ex-
citing research opportunities for numerate scientists.
With typically around 80-120 participants from mathe-
matics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, biol-
ogy and related elds, the MASAMB meetings provide
an intimate setting for exchanging ideas in method-
ological and applied research. Research students and
scientists newly entering the eld of genomic research
are particularly welcome and encouraged to submit ab-
stracts. Details of previous meetings are available at the

ASN/SSB/SSE June 19-23, Huntington Convention Cen-
ter in Cleveland, OH http://www.evolutionmeetings.org
* Main conference registration is now OPEN and talk
& poster submission are available once you complete
main registration. * Talk registration is rst-come, rst-
served and submissions will be accepted until Apr 15 or
until capacity is reached, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.
* All posters are accepted until June 1. * Hotel and
dorm accommodations are open for booking. Visit the
accommodation page on the meeting website. * During
talk submission you can indicate that you want your
talk to be considered for a Spotlight session. There
are several advantages (and no disadvantage) to doing
so: https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/spotlight- ses-
sions.html * Conference-ending Super social will be a
private event (not open to the public) at the Rock &
Roll Hall of Fame that includes dinner, a drink (cash-
bars also onsite) and FULL access to the spectacular
museum (admission is normally $28 on its own) * An-
swers to nearly all question you may have about the
conference can be found on the meeting website.
APR. 15 IS AN IMPORTANT DEADLINE - Early
registration discount ends - Talk submission closes - Ap-
plications for ASN and SSE student/pdf travel grants
close - Applications to volunteer at the conference in
return for 100% rebate on early registration fees close
- Applications for Mayr and Hamilton awards close.
***Eligible students wanting to apply should register for
a regular talk ASAP as these may ll prior to Apr. 15March 1, 2020 EvolDir 5
(you can edit your talk details later)***
OTHER INFORMATION - Consider giving a poster;
our poster invite app will allow you to easily invite up
to 3 attendees of your choice to come view it. Past years
suggest that invited attendees usually come. This can
dramatically change the relative value of a poster com-
pared to a talk as you can speak one-on-one with people
you choose. - FREE professional childcare available
on-site. Bookings is separate from meeting registration.
Details on the website. - There are MANY optional
events before and during the conference. Many are ac-
cessible ONLY to society members. Joining a society
(ASN, SSB, and/or SSE) gets you a discount on meeting
registration the EXCEEDS the cost of membership. -
Sponsor/exhibitor registration is also open. - Safety,
Sustainability and Diversity are all important themes
of the meeting. Check out the page about each on the
meeting website.

The Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles is an
annual congress which gather together International sci-
entists interested in the mechanisms of evolution that
generate the incredible diversity of living things found
on Earth (and possibly beyond)
If the congress was initially a local meeting, it quickly
gained an important weight in the scientic life. Indeed,
whereas the number of participants has been increas-
ing, the geographical origin of the researchers has been
diversifying and widening year by year.
Today, the Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Mar-
seilles has reached a worldwide dimension and plays a
paramount role in the international scientic life: allow-
ing the gathering of high level specialists, it encourages
the exchange of ideas and stimulates the works of the
researchers all through the world.
The following subjects will be discussed:
* Evolutionary biology concepts and modeling; * Biodi-
versity and Systematics; * Comparative genomics ans
post-genomics (at all taxonomic levels); * Self non Self
Evolution * Holobiome evolution * Environment and
biological evolution; * Origin of life and exobiology; *
Non-adaptative versus adaptative evolution; * The 
minorphyla: their usefulness in evolutionary biol-
ogy knowledge; * Convergent evolution * Evolution of
complex traits (Evo-Devo)

Jun22-23
Dear all,
It is my pleasure to announce the upcoming meeting
\From A to S: the FunctionS of Alternative Splicing"
which will be held on June 22-23 2020 at Sorbonne
University, in Paris, France.
With this conference, we aim at bringing together theo-
reticians and experimentalists working on the subject
of alternative splicing. A session will be specically
dedicated to the emergence of new isoforms and splic-
ing patterns in evolution. The advent of RNA-seq has
enabled deep surveys of the splicing complexity across
species. Contributions presenting new developments to
leverage on these data toward elucidating how splicing
has evolved and has contributed to tissue diversication
will be particularly welcome.
Maybe you would be interested in contributing with a
talk or simply attending the conference? Please, could
you spread the word and send your students if you
cannot attend?
For more information visit the conference website:
https://fas.sciencesconf.org . Registrations are now
open and will be free until the end of March. They
will be closed on May 7th or earlier if the maximum
number of attendees is reached (100 participants).
We hope to see you in June!

Dear Colleagues,
Registration is NOW OPEN for the 10th Annual
Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop!
http://www.sachslab.com/symbiosis-2015.php The
TENTH annual Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop will take
place on May 15-17, 2020 at the Sierra Nevada Research
Institute, Yosemite National Park.
Keynote speaker 2020: Martin Kaltenpoth Professor,
Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our continuing goal is to better integrate the
broad groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis and
microbiome research. Yosemite serves as an ideal site
as it is both beautiful and secluded. This will be our
TENTH annual meeting and we have been consistently
attracting scientists from all over the United States and
overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in the mi-
crobiome, cooperation, mutualism, and symbiosis. In
the past we have covered a range of symbiosis topics
from ecology and evolution to molecular mechanisms in
dierent model and non-model systems. We would like
to make room for a diverse group of people so we will ini-
tially accept up to 3 lab members per group (including
the PI) on a rst come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held 16-17,
2020, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 15th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting.
Past attendees and talks can be found here: http://-
www.sachslab.com/symbiosis-2015.php Where: SNRS
has a set of cabins in Wawona and all within a short
walk of the conference room. Costs: See details in the

Basel Switzerland SexualSelection
PhD on \Sexual Selection and Sexual Conict in
Hermaphrodites"
A PhD position, funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation (SNSF), is available in the Sch arer Group
(http://evolution.unibas.ch/scharer/) at the Zoological
Institute, University of Basel, Switzerland. The ideal
start date is 1. April 2020 (with some exibility).
Research in our group focuses on the evolutionary bi-
ology of reproduction in simultaneous hermaphrodites,and uses small and transparent free-living atworms of
the genus Macrostomum as models, permitting the study
of many reproductive processes in vivo. We employ di-
verse approaches, including laboratory experiments, eld
work, transgenesis, genomics, phylogenomics, and the
comparative method. Moreover, one species we study,
Macrostomum lignano, is a well-established model whose
genome was recently published, and that is used to study
stem cell biology, regeneration, ageing, and bioadhesion.
The PhD is part of a larger project aimed at deepening
our understanding of two closely related Macrostomum
species. One species, Macrostomum cliftonensis, shows
the 'reciprocal mating syndrome', where worms mate
and transfer sperm reciprocally into the partner's fe-
male genitalia. This leads to sexual conicts over the16 EvolDir March 1, 2020
fate of the received ejaculate, and involves an intriguing
post-copulatory 'suck' behaviour aimed at removing re-
ceived sperm. The other species, Macrostomum hystrix,
shows the 'hypodermic mating syndrome', where sperm
is transferred via hypodermic insemination. Here the
sperm have to navigate through the partner's body to
the site of fertilisation. A primary aim of the PhD is to
study and contrast dierent processes of post-copulatory
sexual selection between the two mating syndromes, by
taking advantage of sperm tracking in these transparent
worms (as done previously for Macrostomum lignano),
using immunocytochemical labelling of sperm and/or the
establishment of transgenic worms with GFP-expressing
sperm.
The successful PhD candidate will be independent, hard-
working, inquisitive, creative, and collaborative. More-
over, he/she should have a keen interest in evolutionary
biology and must be willing to learn new techniques and
approaches. Documented skills in molecular biology and
microinjection are a clear advantage, as is experience
with working with small organisms. But the willingness
and determination to learn new skills is much more im-
portant. A MSc or equivalent education is required for
this position.
The Zoological Institute is a stimulating and in-
ternational research environment with English as
the primary language (http://evolution.unibas.ch/-
research.htm). The Institute has a strong background
in experimental design, statistics, population genetics,
quantitative genetics, genomics and molecular biology.
It is an ideal place for a PhD in modern evolutionary bi-
ology. Basel is the third largest city in Switzerland and
attractively situated at the foot of the Jura mountains.
It has the beautiful river Rhine, and directly borders
Germany and France, thus oering rich culinary, cul-
tural, and outdoor activities.
To apply, please send a letter of motivation, a CV,
contact details of 2 referees, and a copy of your MSc the-
sis (if available) to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch (electronic
applications in a single le preferred). Review of appli-

PhD position on bioinformatic analysis of molecular
mechanisms of humic adaptation in sh
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD student for study-
ing molecular mechanisms of humic substance-driven
(darkwater) adaptation in Eurasian perch. The success-
ful PhD candidate will be part of an active international
team working with genomics and molecular ecology of
aquatic organisms at the Estonian University of Life
Sciences.
Analysis of local adaptation is one of the most active
elds of research in evolutionary biology but despite
enormous interest and a growing number of analysis
tools, molecular mechanisms of local adaptation at dif-
ferent levels of biological complexity are still largely un-
known. In this project, we combine whole-genome and
transcriptome sequencing, measurements of ecologically
relevant phenotypic variation and whole-organism per-
formance within the common- garden framework to shed
light on causes and consequences of adaptation to ex-
treme humic conditions in aquatic environment. By us-
ing Eurasian perch (Perca uviatilis) as a model species,
we aim to: 1. Identify humic substance-driven selec-
tive footprints in boreal lakes based on whole-genome
SNP analysis testing the hypothesis that humic- acid
driven adaptation in perch involves multiple biological
processes, traits and genes associated with both abi-
otic (low pH and O2, impaired visual environment) and
biotic factors, such as dierences in parasite fauna. 2.
Characterize structural variation in perch and evaluate
potential links to humic substance-driven adaptation.
3. Predict and characterize slightly deleterious protein-
coding variation in perch genome evaluating how small
population sizes lead to increased frequency of slightly
deleterious mutations.

FlindersU KoalaMicroevolution
The Weisbecker Lab at Flinders University is look-
ing for a motivated PhD candidate for a geomet-
ric morphometrics-focused investigation to assess the
drivers of skull shape variation in koalas. This is a part
of a wider research project on how extrinsic and intrinsic
factors can inuence the shape of the skull of marsupi-
als and potentially other mammals as well. This PhD
opportunity is part of a funded Australian Research
Council (ARC) Future Fellowship Project awarded to
Assoc. Prof. Vera Weisbecker.
Mammalian diversity is the result of dierent selection
pressures over time creating a variety of adaptive shapes.
However, the origins of this shape variation within single
species are dicult to discern. In particular, the degree
to which genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity
drive intraspecic shape variation is not well known in
non-model organisms. This is an exciting evolutionary
problem but also a conservation-related issue in iconic
mammals such as the koala, whose survival as a species
might depend on their capacity to adapt their shape -
particularly their skull shape - to changing conditions
and dietary regimes. The lab's preliminary data on
koalas even suggest that captivity might have a consid-
erable impact on the skull shape of individuals, raising
the question of whether captive conditions might impede
success in the wild.
The project is an exciting opportunity to assess the
interaction between short-term extrinsic factors and
longer-term intrinsic imuences to understand the ori-
gins of within-species shape variation in the iconic koala.
The project will amalgamate investigations in evolu-
tionary mammalian biology with explorations of using
geometric morphometrics as a tool for population phe-
nomics. A particular focus will be on how quickly skull
shape can change in the short term, and how much of
this response is driven by individual plasticity vs. heri-
table, microevolutionary change. For an impression of
the work involved, see https://doi.org/10.1186/s12983-
019-0338-5 . Numerous research avenues can be taken20 EvolDir March 1, 2020
within this topic, depending on the interest of the can-
didate. This can be negotiated, but generally, the more
of their own ideas the candidate brings into the project,
the better.|
Essential skills for this position are good R skills, ideally
in the phylogenetics and geometric morphometrics pack-
ages. Good spoken and written English is also essential,
as are independence and self-motivation .
The Scholarship is open to students wishing to com-
mence a PhD in mid-2020 and is valued at the the
AGRTPS of AUD $28,092 (2020 full time rate) per
annum (tax free).|The scholarship will be awarded
for a maximum of three years. Additional funding for
conference and research support is available from Col-
lege research support schemes. The Scholarship will be
suitable for students with an Honours degree or inter-
national equivalent in vertebrate evolution, veterinary
sciences, ecology, palaeontology, anatomy, or any other
relevant discipline.
AUSTRALIAN AND OVERSEAS APPLICATIONS
ARE ENCOURAGED. For UK applicants, a Master's
degree is essential. If you have not nished your degree
yet, you can still register your interest.
The successful candidate will work within the vibrant

## Two funded PhD opportunities ##
# The ecology and evolution of dynamic colour sig-
nalling (Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia)
Many animals communicate using vivid colour signals
that appear shiny, metallic or iridescent. These signals
arise from innovative surface nanostructures that show-
case the wonder of adaptive evolution. Little is however
known about how they are viewed and perceived, what
information they communicate, and how they are con-
trolled genetically. This project will explore one or more
of these questions using laboratory-tractable organisms
such as tropical butteries and shes.
# The positions You will be guided to develop and pur-
sue a distinctive, integrative doctoral research program
in the evolutionary ecology of iridescent colour signalling.
Possible components of your program span the measure-
ment and manipulation of behaviour, genetic breeding
experiments, experimental evolution, phylogenetic com-
parative analyses, and the physiology of visual signal
reception. There are opportunities for eldwork in trop-
ical Australia and for the use of innovative technology
such as custom-engineered drones to visualize how ani-
mals respond to colour signals in their environment. You
will gain skills and expertise with broad applicability
and discover knowledge that may inform communica-

PhD position in Systematics and Evolutionary Research,
with a focus on the evolutionary importance of inter-

University
A fully supported 4-year PhD position is available under
the joint supervision of Dr. Martin Irestedt (Naturhis-
toriska Riksmuseet) and Dr. Mozes Blom (Museum
f ur Naturkunde). The prospective candidate will be
mostly based in Stockholm, but frequent visits to Berlin
are encouraged. Both primary investigators are evo-

more information, see https://www.researchgate.net/-
prole/Martin Irestedt and https://mozesblom.com .
The deadline to apply is February 28, 2020.
Project description. The objective of this project is to
study the evolutionary importance of interspecic gene
ow and its role in promoting phenotypic change. In par-
ticular, the project focuses on ancient and more recent
hybridization in Birds-of-Paradise as they are notorious
hybridizers even across genera. Several species display
plumage ornamentations that are surprisingly similar
to those found in distant relatives and our previous re-
search using genomic data has shown that hybridization
between such lineages is not uncommon. This suggests
that the genetic variants underlying, e.g., plumage or-
namentation might have been transferred between dis-
tantly related linages through adaptive introgression.
Birds-of-Paradise are thus an ideal system to study the
adaptive potential of past hybridization and investigate
how this can ultimately facilitate macroevolutionary
change. In addition, the genomic data sets generated
within this project will also create opportunities to study
biogeographical patterns, demographic changes through
time, and genome evolution. The project builds on an
ongoing project on evolutionary genomics in Birds-of-March 1, 2020 EvolDir 25
Paradise led by the Swedish Museum of Natural History
in collaboration with other research groups in Sweden
and abroad.
Qualications. In order to join our team, we are looking
for someone with a background in biology, life sciences,
genetics, bioinformatics, or related subjects. Applicants
should have knowledge and skills pertaining to evolu-
tionary biology, phylo- and population genomics and
bioinformatics. Equally important, we are looking for a
creative, curious and motivated person with excellent
communication and interpersonal skills. No eldwork is
expected to be part of the project.
Position. The position is located at the Department
of Bioinformatics and Genetics, at the Naturhistoriska
Riksmuseet in Stockholm. We oer a friendly work-
ing environment, access to professional training in both
project related as well as soft skills and access to the
scientic research infrastructure (e.g. High-Performance
Computing Infrastructure, Wet-labs etc) needed to suc-
cessfully complete this project. Moreover, other working
groups within the department include Fredrik Ronquist,
Love Dalen and Per Ericsson. Strong existing connec-
tions are in place with the lab groups of Alexander Suh
(Uppsala University) and Knud Jonsson (University of
Copenhagen). Additional support can be obtained from
the Museum f ur Naturkunde Berlin and includes access
to collections, working space and the opportunity to
collaborate with research groups throughout both mu-
seums. Finally, in line with the Scandinavian tradition,

PhD position in evolutionary biology, social supergene
maintenance, University of Lausanne
A Ph.D. position in evolutionary biology is available
in the group of Prof. Michel Chapuisat at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne,
Switzerland. The group studies social evolution. We are
currently investigating the evolution and maintenance of
a supergene controlling social organization in ants. Our
approach combines genomics, genetics, behavioral ex-
periments and ecological surveys in the eld. For more
information, seehttp://www.unil.ch/dee/page7000.html
. Animal societies vary greatly in social organization, yet
the genomic, behavioral and ecological processes causing
this diversity are poorly understood. The Alpine silver
ant Formica selysi provides an ideal system to study the
evolution of alternative social organization, because a
supergene 'V a large group of linked genes 'V determines
whether the colony has one or multiple queens. The
successful candidate will perform experiments to betterMarch 1, 2020 EvolDir 29
understand the genomic, behavioral and/or ecological
factors contributing to the maintenance of this social
polymorphism.
Your qualications: In order to complete our team, we
are looking for someone with a Master's degree in bi-
ology, life sciences, genetics, bioinformatics, or related
subjects. Applicants should have knowledge and skills
pertaining to evolutionary biology, genetics, genomics,

*PhD position in Evolutionary Genetics at Institute of
Genomics, University of Tartu, Estonia*
Deadline: 10.02.2020
Position description: We are looking for a motivated
PhD student with a background in archaeology, genetics
and/or bioinformatics who is interested in completing
their PhD program at the University of Tartu and in
being part of the cGEM research group.
Recent methodological advances to extract ancient DNA
from human fossils have provided an opportunity to
study genetic variation and selection over time. The
growing number of large cohorts with genotype and phe-
notype data (such as biobanks) has provided resources tolink this genetic variation to disease phenotypes. Recent
studies that have connected diseases to selective pres-
sures have shown that in some instances an advantage
in the past may have come with a price for present-
day populations: for example, many genetic variants
associated with immune- mediated, cardiovascular and
metabolic diseases show signs of having been recently
favoured by natural selection.
This project focuses on genetic adaptations to environ-
mental and cultural changes in human populations of
West Eurasia during the last 20,000 years, a time period
that covers major shifts in climate, diet and pathogen
exposures in this region. The project will take advan-
tage of high-quality genetic and biomedical datasets,
including ancient DNA from dated human fossils, whole
genome sequences from modern populations, and case-
control and biobank datasets with associated genetic,
biomarker and health information (such as the Estonian
Biobank).
The main aim of this project is to systematically map
how natural selection has shaped human genetic vari-
ation during this time period and the consequences
of these adaptations for health in present-day popula-
tions. With some of the genetic variation in present-day
non-Africans being inherited from admixture with Nean-
dertals ~55,000 years ago, the project will further inves-
tigate which role this admixture has played in shaping
these adaptive processes.
The outcome of this project will (1) provide important
information about the role of selection and admixture
in the interplay between genetics and environments over
long time scales, which are dicult to obtain from con-
temporary populations and environments. The project
will (2) help resolving the role of dierent dietary and
environmental (life-style) factors in the susceptibility
for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in present-day
populations, which are important when using genetic
information to personalise the prediction, prevention
and treatment of these diseases.
Who we are: The Institute of Genomics of the University
of Tartu was formed in 2018 through a merger of the
Estonian Genome Center and the Estonian Biocentre,
bringing together world class expertise in medical, popu-
lation and evolutionary genomics. We host the Estonian
Biobank (www.geenivaramu.ee) which has 200,000 par-
ticipants and is connected to national health registries
for phenotypic information. Starting in May 2018, we
opened a brand-new ancient DNA laboratory, we have a
core facility for DNA/RNA sequencing and genotyping
and have access to a High- Performance Computing
Cluster (www.hpc.ut.ee). The Centre of Genomics, Evo-

Avignon, southern France.
This is a permanent position.
See: https://jobs.inrae.fr/en/open-competitions/open-
competions-research-scientists-crcn/crcn20-ecofa-2 Ra-
tionale: The overarching goal of the INRA research unit
\"Ecology of Mediterranean Forests\" (URFM) is the
sustainable management of forests and the conserva-
tion of biodiversity. In this context, URFM studies the
processes involved in the dynamics and functioning of
Mediterranean forests, as well as mixed and disturbed
forests, through approaches combining experimentation
and modelling. Knowledge of these processes contribute
to the science of ecology and is integrated into generalMarch 1, 2020 EvolDir 39
workows and methods to propose adaptive manage-
ment solutions for these ecosystems in the context of
global change.
Job description: The successful candidate will develop a
project in entomology and population biology to study
how Mediterranean phytophagous insects, through their
biology and host use strategies, can aect the forest
ecosystem. Reciprocally , you will also study how other
disturbances (drought and re) aect insect demography.
Your research will be based on experimental approaches
at the individual and population levels, both on the in-
sect and its host, to specically address plant-tree insect
interactions. This will include the assessment of how
climate change aects these interactions and how they
can in turn aect the direct impact of climate change
and disturbances on the dynamics of Mediterranean
forests. For this purpose, you will benet from the sci-
entic and technical expertise of URFM on the study
of the role of insects in the dynamics of forest dieback,
with particular expertise at the interface between the
functioning of insect populations and tree populations.
Work conditions: You will conduct your research in
close association with an entomologist from URFM's
Population Biology and Evolution team whose exper-
tise is in the biology, the dynamics and the genetics of
insect populations. URFM also provides an excellent
transdisciplinary framework for developing the research
program proposed for this position. URFM's research
closely combines population biology and the evolution of
trees and insects, functional ecology and tree community
dynamics, and re physics and ecology. The entomo-
fauna is considered a major biotic factor involved in
forest disturbance processes, and as such, is the subject
of more general ecological work, including disturbance
modelling, forest adaptation to disturbances, and the
role of forest management in this adaptation.

to contactnicolas.lartillot@univ-lyon1.frat their earliest
convenience.
Models, algorithms and machine learning in bioinfor-
matics and in genomics.March 1, 2020 EvolDir 41
Biology is currently undergoing a major technological
and conceptual revolution. This shift in paradigm is
stimulated by the production of massive amounts of data,
which open new perspectives on complex processes at the
molecular, cellular, population or macro-evolutionary
scales. In turn, these ongoing developments call for an
increased integration between data analysis, stochastic
modeling, statistical and machine learning, algorithmics
and computer science.
In this context, a new professor position is suscepti-
ble to open early 2021 in the Laboratoire de Biom etrie
et de Biologie ~Avolutive (LBBE, Universit e de Lyon,
France), for a teaching and a research activity in the
elds of mathematics, statistics and/or algorithmics,
such as applied to bioinformatics and genomics. Ow-
ing to the specic challenges raised by the inherently
multi-disciplinary nature of bioinformatics, a special
emphasis in the recruitment will be put on the ability
of the candidate to develop and promote an ambitious
strategic and pedagogical perspective concerning the
place of mathematics, statistics, computer and data sci-
ences in the teaching programs and the current research
in bioinformatics.
Teaching. Teaching will be primarily targeted to the
bioinformatics master, with additional teaching eort
also devoted to the local undergraduate and graduate
programs of biosciences, ecology and health. In this
context, the person recruited will have much freedom in
the design of innovative courses in mathematics, statis-
tics, stochastic modeling and/or algorithmics applied
to bioinformatics and genomics. She/he will also have
the opportunity to participate in the development of
new multi-disciplinary programs, in partnership with
the math and computer sciences departments of the
university. Of note, some of the courses (in particular
undergraduate programs) will have to be given in french
(within two years after recruitment).
Research. The person recruited will be aliated to the
LBBE, where she/he will have the opportunity to de-
velop a research project with a strong theoretical and
methodological component, in relation with stochastic
modeling and data analysis in bioinformatics, evolu-
tionary, molecular or cellular biology. Her/his research
activity may pertain to a broad range of themes, includ-
ing: methods, algorithms and stochastic models applied
to multi-omics; machine learning, AI and deep learning
applied to the analysis of molecular and functional data;
models and methods in population genetics, evolution-
ary or statistical genomics. Finally, the methodological
research developed by the person recruited in the context
of the present call may also happen to meet some of the
current needs in ecology, evolution and health sciences,
and as such, oer an opportunity for a broad range ofpossible collaborations within the host laboratory.

1m to 5m. The mangrovegerygone's habitat is open
salt ats. The study site is rugged, hot, and venomous
snakes and ticks are quite common. Working days are
long, with early starts, six days a week. Therefore, ap-
plicants must have good physical tness to walk along
the creek with a heavy ladder, withstand harsh condi-
tions at the site, and maintain an energetic attitude
despite long hours in hot and humid conditions. Work
schedules and duties will vary, so exibility is a must.
Applicants should work well alone and in a small group
and have a sense of direction to work in remote areas.
Previous experience with eldwork is highly desired,
and nest searching experience is also preferred, but a
positive attitude is much more important than tons of
eld experience.
Housing will be provided, and you can get reimbursed
for food and ights up to $750 AUD per month and
you will enjoy fantastic wildlife viewing opportunities
in Darwin.
To apply, send a cover letter detailing interests, previ-
ous relevant eld research experience, dates of avail-
ability and a CV as well as a list of names and
contact information for 2 referees to Hee-Jin Noh

*Issue information*:
Human-induced environmental changes are the most sig-
nicant threat to biodiversity in the 21st century. Rapid
changes in environmental conditions impose novel se-
lection pressures on organisms and increase the risk
of population extinction. Understanding what aects
the capacity of populations to adapt to environmen-
tal change is now one of the most important issues in
ecology and evolutionary biology. The role of sexual se-
lection in inuencing a population's ability to cope with
environmental change has been a topic of increasing
interest in recent years. In addition, there is accumulat-
ing evidence that environmental change may inuence
the strength and/or direction of sexual selection in nat-
ural populations. The aim of this Special Column is
to highlight new insights on these potential feedback
loops and complex interactions between sexual selection
and environmental change. We are thus interested in
studies that investigate (i) how environmental change
may inuence sexual selection and/or (ii) how sexual
selection may inuence adaptation to environmental
change. Empirical and theoretical studies are welcome.
Researchers interested in contributing to this special
column should send a title and abstract to the guest
editors. Manuscripts should be submitted before the
deadline. Manuscripts received after the deadline will
be considered as submissions for regular issues.
Submitted papers should not have been published pre-

Finland FieldAssist AvianLekking
Field Assistant in evolutionary biology
We are seeking a eld assistant with an interest in eld-
work experience and evolutionary biology. The eld
assistant will collect data related to two PhD projects
on ru breeding and movement ecology in Finland. This
research is a collaboration of the Max Planck Institute
for Ornithology (Germany) and the University of Oulu
(Finland).
Background: Rus are sexually dimorphic lekking
waders with a fascinating mating system making them
a classic model organism for evolutionary biologists.
Ru males have three Alternative Reproductive Tactics
(ARTs), that is ru males dier in morphology and re-
productive behaviour to avoid direct competition. Part
of our lab focuses on understanding the maintenance of
these distinct ARTs on an evolutionary time scale. In
order to do this, two PhD students are researching the
wild demographics and male movement ecology of rus.
Activities: The position starts 27 April 2020 and re-
quires a minimum stay of 2 months. The housing is in
close proximity to the eld-site, in the Liminganlahti
area, about 1 hour away from Oulu, Finland.
In the rst part of the eld season, the eld assistant will
do regular lek observations, focusing on male courtship
displays, mating events and lek visitations. The eld
assistant will also assist in the capture and radio-tagging
of lekking males. As the season progresses, the eld
assistant will collect ru nesting and chick survival data.
Duties during the nesting phase will include nest search-
ing, egg measurement and transport, female ru capture,
and nest protection. During the chick rearing phase, the
eld assistant will assist in radio tracking of ru chicks,
capture of tagged and untagged chicks and classication
of chick mortality causes. He or she will also assist
in establishing a network of solar powered automated
tracking stations and its regular maintenance. We will
cover housing costs at the eld-site and transportation
from Munich. If eligible, the eld assistant may apply
for a living stipend through an Erasmus internship with
the University of Oulu, otherwise we will cover essential
living costs.
Acquire skills: The eld assistant will gain experience in
handling, ringing, and blood sampling of live birds, as66 EvolDir March 1, 2020
well as nest roping, specimen photography, articial in-
cubation, navigation with hand GPS and radio tracking
of live birds.
Required skills: The eld assistant should be willing to
work in harsh environmental conditions such as low and
high temperatures, harsh winds, and high humidity. He
or she should be able to work in the presence of biting
insects and under variable/exible schedules. The eld
assistant must be in good enough physical condition to
walk several kilometres over muddy and uneven ground
in a single day with a 10 'V 18 kg of equipment on their
back. Finally, they should be meticulous in note taking
and data recording.
Contact: If you are interested or have questions please
contact: Hanna Algora (halgora@orn.mpg.de) or James
D.M. Tolliver (jtolliver@orn.mpg.de). When applying
please include a short cover letter describing how you

*The Study Site*
*Weather*
Gabon has an Equatorial climate with little seasonality.
Precipitations are important, almost every day from
October to May, and days may be hot (up to 30 ^AoC),
although the Lekedi Park benets from a cooler weather
because of its altitude (600m). The long dry season,
from June to September, is characterized by cool weather
(temperatures can fall below 18 ^AoC) with no precipita-
tion.
*Landscape*
The Lekedi Park is characterized by a mix of savannas
and gallery forests interspersed with rivers and riverbeds.
Equatorial Marantaceae forests are found in the area.
*Wildlife*
The Lekedi park is home to a variety of wildlife including
forest bualos, several Apes (chimpazees, gorillas) and
other primates (cephus, nictitans) and, of course, man-
drills! Predators include, occasionally, leopards (but
don't expect any encounter with them!). Birds and
reptiles also abound.
*Location*
The Lekedi park is located in Southern Gabon. It is
only a 1 hour drive from Moanda, the nearest town that
comprises hotels, petrol stations, banks, basic shops and
markets.

MolecularEcologyPrize
CallForNominations
Nominations for Molecular Ecology Prize
We are soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular
Ecology Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scientic
society, so there is no body that actively promotes the
discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial board
of the journal *Molecular Ecology* therefore created
the Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void,
and recognize signicant contributions to this area of70 EvolDir March 1, 2020
research. The prize selection committee is independent
of the journal and its editorial board.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to molecular ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previous
winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf, Louis Bernatchez,
Nancy Moran, Robin Waples, and Scott Edwards.
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words; longer submissions
will not be accepted) and the candidate's CV directly
to Andrea Sweigart (sweigart@uga.edu) by Thursday,
April 2, 2020. Organized campaigns to submit multiple
nominations for the same person are not necessary and
can be counterproductive. Also, note that nominations
from previous years do not roll over.

The New Zealand Journal of Zoology invites submissons
of papers focused on environmental DNA (eDNA) with
some connection to animals. Environmental DNA is
generally regarded as DNA extracted from environmen-
tal samples such as soil or water without rst isolating
the target organism(s), however we will also include
papers discussing sequencing of bulk samples of entire
organisms isolated from various environmental samples.
The special issue's wide scope means we will also wel-
come papers discussing microbiology topics connected
to animals.
The guest editors are Dr Jonathan Banks (Cawthron
Institute and Lincoln University) and Associate Pro-
fessor Gavin Lear (The University of Auckland, NZ).
Jonathan's research interests include identifying the
source of faecal contamination of freshwaters usingeDNA, and characterising freshwater sh communities
from eDNA collected from water samples. Gavin's re-
search principally explores the complex interactions
among microbial communities, their DNA and the varied
environments in which they reside. As a recent leader
of New Zealand's Biological Heritage National Science
Challenge 'eDNA project', Dr Lear's research interests
include investigations into the fate of sh, plant and
insect environmental DNA.
Expressions of Interest (EOI) are being sought for pa-
pers from researchers wishing to publish in the eDNA
special issue. Please send a preliminary title, au-
thor list and a short descriptive paragraph outlining
the scope of your proposed manuscript as soon as
convenient to the chief guest editor,by21stFebruary
2020.EOIs and other questions can be directed to
Jonathan.Banks@cawthron.org.nz.
The guest editors will make a decision on which
manuscripts to invite for the special issue and will notify
the invited authors by28 February 2020. Note that an
invitation to submit does not guarantee acceptance for
publication; this will depend on the outcome of peer
review process and authors meeting critical time sched-
ules.
The issue is scheduled for publication in late 2020
or early 2021. We anticipate that the deadline for
manuscript submission will be June 2020 and peer-
reviewing and revision completed by November 2020.
Each manuscript will be published online as soon as the
manuscript receives nal acceptance; the special issue
in its entirety is expected to be published by late 2020
or early 2021.
The New Zealand Journal of Zoology has no page
charges, oers free colour printing. and has a supportive
editorial team to assist all researchers with the publish-
ing process. The journal welcomes submissions from
researchers at all stages of their careers.

FrogDiversity
***repost to correct link***
NSF funded Summer Research Experience for Under-
graduates (REU) investigating morphological diversity
of frogs and toads
The Moen Lab at Oklahoma State University in Still-
water is seeking applications from a group of highly mo-
tivated and diverse undergraduate students to conduct
independent research projects concerning the morpho-
logical diversity of frogs and toads under the supervision
of a postdoctoral mentor. As part of the program, the
successful applicants will be trained to conduct scienticresearch and receive mentoring to advance their careers
as scientists. Successful projects may lead to future
research opportunities in the Moen lab and publication
of a manuscript. Successful applicants will also receive a
$3600 stipend and housing through OK State University.
Brief description of the program
The program runs for 8 weeks, from 1 June - 24 July
2020. Students will work with a research mentor to
choose a project, collect and analyze data, and present
the results of the project at the end of the summer.
Students will also travel to the Biodiversity Institute at
the University Kansas to see one of the world's largest
amphibian collections, select specimens for research, and
talk to curators and graduate students about collections-
based research and careers.
esearch projects will focus on the evolution, morphol-
ogy, and mechanics of movement of anurans (frogs and
toads). Potential subjects include:
(1) The relationship of body form and function
(2) Evolutionary biomechanics (3) Macroevolution of
ecology, morphology, and biogeography
Eligibility
Currently enrolled, non-graduating undergraduate stu-
dents majoring in biology, or biology-related discipline
are eligible to apply. Previous research experience is

Spain VolFieldAssist PlantEvolEcol
JunJul
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and
Technology (IST) Austria is recruiting volunteers to as-
sist with eldwork on plant adaptation in the Pyrenees
(Spain) this coming summer (June-July).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary processes
underlying population divergence in wild Antirrhinummajus (snapdragons). We focus on natural hybrid zones
between two subspecies with dierent ower colours.
Most of the eld work is contributing to a long-term
pedigree project aimed at establishing a direct link from
genotype to phenotype to tness. With tens of thou-
sands of samples collected over ten years so far, this
provides an exciting and powerful system to examine
many outstanding questions about adaptation and quan-
titative genetics in wild populations.
The work: We are seeking volunteers to assist with the
eld research, which involves mapping the location of
individual plants (GPS), tagging and sampling them for
leaves and owers, measuring quantitative traits, and
processing samples back at the eld station. There may
also be opportunities to be involved in other projects
on plant-insect interactions. The work is highly team-
orientated, typically in groups of 2-3. This is a great
opportunity for anybody looking to obtain experience
in eldwork relating to evolutionary biology and plant
ecology.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia).
We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a pic-
turesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(WITHIN EUROPE) are covered. However, we cannot
oer any further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students/graduates with a strong
interest in working outdoors with plants. You must be
meticulous with recording data and also be comfortable
working as part of a team. Experience with eld-based
projects and plants is preferred but not essential.
We require a minimum stay of 3 weeks between May
28 and July 30. To apply, send your CV or resume by
March 15. Include a few sentences about your back-
ground and why you are interested, and include the ap-
proximate date range you are available. Send any ques-
tions and your application to carina.baskett@ist.ac.at.

Sussex FieldAssist SocialInsects
We are seeking eld assistants to help with research so-
cial behaviour in the ground nesting sweat bee, Halictus
rubicundus for periods of between 2 and 5 months. This
could be early April to early June, or late June to late
August, or both combined. Start and end dates can
be negotiated to some extent within these constraints,
but the successful candidate/s must be available for the
entire period agreed.
The assistant will be working alongside a Postdoctoral
researcher at the Knepp rewilding estate in Sussex,
UK. H. rubicundus is a medium sized bee that nests
in small colonies (fewer than 10 individuals) in the
ground and has an insignicant sting. Work will in-
volve: observing foraging behaviour, handling and mark-
ing bees, setting up video cameras, uploading video
footage and excavating nests from the ground. In
warm weather, eld assistants will work long days in
the eld; in bad weather there will be tasks to carry
out back at the accommodation/opportunity for time
o. Because the work involves recording colour marks
on individual animals, the job would not be suitable
for someone who is colour-blind. See our research
group website for more information about the kind
of work we do (https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/sta/-
index.php?web id=Jeremy Field).
Experience of working with insects and a
Degree (or working towards a Degree) in a
Behaviour/Evolution/Ecology-related topic are
desired. The successful applicants must have enthusi-
asm for eldwork and be prepared to work hard. They
will obtain excellent experience of cutting-edge social
insect research.
Shared accommodation near Knepp is provided, but as-
sistants are required to pay for their own food/personal
expenses. Assistants receive 125 per week to cover costs.
At the time of applying, candidates must be able to
demonstrate that they have the right to work in the
UK.
Please contact Dr Rebecca Boulton

of several skuuls but using Adobe Flash Player and Mi-
crosoft is planing stop using this tool in Google Chrome
in 2020. I wrote today to boneclones asking them to

3 - https://sketchfab.com They have several skulls online
and you can rotate them in several directions.

Expenses paid eld assistant positions to study the
breeding ecology of blue tits and collared ycatchers on
the wonderful island of Gotland.
For the upcoming eld season (20 April-20/30 June
2020) we are looking for an expenses-paid eld assistant
to join the team working on the Swedish island of Got-
land. It is a famous bird study site, with over 40 years
of bird ecology monitoring. Additionally an amazingly
beautiful and unique location for all bird lovers, a major
birding and bird migration hotspot.
The period of stay is exible - longer stays will be
preferred but in your application please specify which
period in the eld season you would be able to cover.
Our current project concerns two species: the blue tit
and the collared ycatcher. Apart from general mon-
itoring of both species' breeding we conduct specic
research, which now concentrates on colour biology andexpression in the blue tit. The work requires long hours
spent in the forest in variable weather conditions (al-
though the weather has been very gentle the past few
seasons on Gotland), precision in handling the birds and
recording the data, and the ability to work in a team.
Daily workload varies from a couple of hours to 8-9 hours,
depending on the time in the season. The team will
consist of 7-11 assistants, plus an additional collaborat-
ing team of similar size from France, staying in another
location close by. Basic procedures used during eld-
work involve catching adult birds with mist-nets, ringing
of adults and nestlings, morphological measurements,
blood-sampling of some birds for genetic analyses. We
provide training on the procedures, but a basic knowl-
edge of bird morphology and bird handling experience
is more than welcome.
Qualications: (1) BSc/MSc in Biology, Ecology, Evolu-
tion or similar qualication (current students will also
be considered on a case by case basis) (2) Previous eld
experience will be a big plus (3) Ability to work in
small teams and sociable personality (4) Bird ringing
and mist-netting experience is desired but can also be
learned on site (5) EU-valid driving licence will be an
advantage (6) Good English (it is a working language
in the team)
We will cover for the accommodation (lodging in rooms
shared with other eld assistants - usually up to 2 per-
sons per room - in a beautiful & comfortable, large
house in the middle of the eldwork area), travel ex-
penses from and to the|study site (within reasonable
limits and up to 450 EUR; if more is expected - let's
discuss possibilities on a case by case basis), as well as
the living expenses.
Applications - including a CV, a lshort letter of
motivation (1/2 A4 page) and the name of one
referee - should be send to Szymon Drobniak
szymek.drobniak@gmail.com, ideally as a single PDF
le.
Full consideration will be given to applications received
until the 15th of March. After that date applications
will be monitored if any additional assistants would be
required.
Please do not hesitate to write to us if you have more
and specic questions.

***Project details Whole genome duplication (WGD,
polyploidization) is a dramatic genome-wide mutation
whose ubiquity across eukaryotes suggests an adaptive
benet, although the underlying mechanism remains un-
known. In the project, the successful applicant will test
the hypothesis that WGD promotes formation and/or
later accumulation of structural changes in a genome
(gene duplications, inversions, repetitive DNA prolifer-
ation), potentially providing adaptive benets when
facing novel environmental challenges. The project
will build on our research in Arabidopsis arenosa that
demonstrated that WGD can increase the capacity of
its natural populations to accumulate adaptive varia-
tion, but the candidate will extend well-beyond this
system to additional species to discern the generality of
initial ndings from the A. arenosa system. The core
work will focus on analysis of population genomic data
from eld surveys of ploidy-variable systems (diploid-
autotetraploid), providing replicates of the WGD pro-
cess in natural conditions. There will be possibility to
expand to analyses of variation in experimental popula-
tions involving newly synthesized polyploids. General
conclusions will be drawn taking advantage from repli-
cated ploidy-variable plant species, which are partly
already sampled and sequenced. Alongside the head -
start with available data, the candidate is expected to
be fully involved in the overall project design and lead
the analytical part of the project. For overall info on the

and genetic bases of menstruation are not fully under-
stood, despite its involvement in critical gynecological
conditions. EVOMENS aims to prole cellular popula-
tions, gene expression and gene regulation in the uterine
lining of several primates across the female hormonal
cycle to characterize how menstruation evolved at the
functional level. The postdoc will be in charge of func-
tional genomics experiments (single-cell transcriptomics,
cell sorting, cell population RNA-seq and ATAC-seq)
and data analysis.
Applicants must have a PhD degree or equivalent, or
have submitted their thesis at the time of applica-
tion. The applicant should have wet-lab experience
relevant to the project such as functional genomics ex-
periments, transcriptomics, experimental genetics, cell
sorting and/or cell culture. Computational experience
is appreciated, but not required 'V however, the success-
ful candidate will be expected to develop that skillset
and will receive appropriate support. The postdoc will
also be expected to write manuscripts, deliver research
presentations and be involved in the daily life and man-

The laboratory of Sarah Anderson at Iowa State Uni-
versity is seeking a postdoctoral researcher for a project
in transposable element genomics. The Anderson Ge-
nomics Lab studies Transposable Element (TE) diversity
across genomes using maize as a model. We aim to better
understand the consequences of TE insertions on the ex-
pression dynamics of genes during seed development and
in response to stress. Transposable elements are highly
variable among genotypes, and while there are several
known examples of naturally varying TE insertions that
are the source of classical phenotypes, the genome-wide
contributions of TE variability to transcriptome and
epigenome dynamics remains under-explored.
This position aims to identify features or sequences
within TEs that predict regulatory eects on nearby
genes and test these predictions in diverse genotypes
with known presence-absence variation in TE insertions.
The project will require creating workows to integrate
high-throughput sequencing data across a variety ofMarch 1, 2020 EvolDir 89

TOPIC: Drivers of diversication in predatory gas-
tropods
One full-time postdoctoral position for 2 years is avail-
able at the Mus eum National d'Histoire Naturelle
(MNHN), located in Paris, France. The position will
start the 1st of June 2020. A one-year extension is
negotiable.
The post-doctoral fellow will work in the framework of
the ERC project ^ a euro ^AHyperdiverse\ (ERC-COG-
2019, # 865101), who seeks at identifying the drivers
of diversication in a group of marine predatory snails,
the neogastropods. One of the goals of the project is to
sequence 15 genomes of species characterized by various
feeding and developmental strategies, two characters
that might have inuenced the evolutionary success of
the group.
These genomes would be the rst for neogastropods (ex-
cept for some low-quality, poorly assembled genomes),
which are also known to have a large genome size (2-
5Gb), with many repeated elements. The post-doc fel-
low will have to assemble the genomes, combining data
from various sequencing technologies (Illumina, Minion,
PacBio), and will also be in charge of the genome anno-
tation, in particular to identify candidate genes involved
in feeding (e.g. toxins, anaesthetics, etc^ a euro ^A) and
in larval development, integrating population genomicsapproaches.
Within the "Institut de Systematique, Evolution et Bio-
diversite\ of the MNHN, the post-doc fellow will work in
the team 3E ("Exploration, Esp eces, Evolution\), work-
ing on the systematics and evolution of benthic marine
invertebrates. The team regularly organizes expeditions
that the post-doc fellow may join, to enrich the MNHN
collections and provide data for a highly active inter-
national network of taxonomists and evolutionists with
which the fellow will collaborate.

SLU Sweden PlantInteractions
Two year postdoctorial position in evolutionary biol-
ogy at SLU Alnarp, Sweden - plant interactions with
antagonists and the root microbiome
Project description
We seek a motivated postdoctoral researcher who will
work on a new project investigating selection of plant
defence against antagonists in wild Solanum in relation
to the composition of the root microbiome in dierent
habitats. An exciting new development in studies of
plant and animal immunity indicates that microbial
composition in the animal gut, or the phylo- or rhi-
zosphere of plants, is a strong contributing factor to
good health. It has been suggested that microorganisms
present on plants may act as an outer, rst layer of im-
mune defence against infection by pathogenic microbes.
To gain a more general understanding of evolution of
plant health, we need to conduct studies in natural pop-
ulations taking into account selective forces generated
by microbial communities and their interactions with
plants.
The project also has important applied aspects for future
development of sustainable plant protection strategies.
The project will be performed in close connection withintegrated plant protection in cultivated potato against
the important potato diseases early and late blight.
Organisation
This position is based in the Integrated Plant Protection
unit at the Department of Plant Protection Biology at
the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU,
Alnarp, Sweden). Our department, is an interdisci-
plinary constellation, encompassing Chemical Ecology,
Resistance Biology and Integrated Plant Protection re-
search units, providing excellent opportunities for strong
research collaboration within and outside the depart-
mental area. Research eorts at the department are
directed towards both fundamental and applied research.
Applied plant protection research is carried out in col-
laboration with industry and focuses primarily on the
development of environmentally sustainable pest and
disease control strategies for agriculture and horticul-
ture, both in Sweden and internationally.
Qualications
The candidate should hold a PhD degree in biology
or equivalent. Previous experiences from research in
evolutionary biology, molecular biology, interactions be-
tween plants and their antagonists, bioinformatic anal-
yses of microbiome data or quantication of selection
dierentials are merits. Candidates should be uent in
spoken and written English. The candidate must be
capable of independent planning, execution and eval-
uation of experiments, and should have an interest in
theory development. As a person you are enthusiastic
and responsible, and have excellent collaborate skills.
Personal skills are therefore an important part of the
evaluation. Applicants that hold a driving license will
be evaluated favorably.
As postdoctoral appointments are career-developing po-
sitions for junior researchers, we are primarily looking
for candidates with a doctoral degree that is three years
old at most.

StellenboschU PlantSexualSelection
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP 2020 (R250000)
TITLE: Quantum dots and Pollen wars
DESCRIPTION: Much of the extraordinary variety in
oral form is thought to have arisen through sexual
selection, with a multitude of strategies to move male
gametes as eciently as possible from one ower to
another ower on a dierent plant. Flowers are often
likened to billboards, colourful signs that attract visitors
and maximize pollen export as well as receipt. But it
is clear that ecient pollen movement is inuenced by
more than just the ability to attract pollinators. Flowers
also interact mechanically with pollinators, the adaptive
t between plant and pollinator morphology sometimes
being likened to a lock and key which enhances pollen
transfer. But imagine if the available space for pollen
transfer onto a pollinator's body is limited by how much
pollen is already on the pollinator. Or if rival pollen,
already on a pollinator reduces the probability of suc-
cess by new pollen being placed on the pollinator. This
may lead to pollen wars, where each visit by a polli-
nator represents a chance for a ower to smother or
displace the pollen from rival males and so alter the
three-dimensional structure of how pollen from dierent
owers is laid down on pollinators (pollen landscapes).
By attaching dierent coloured quantum dots (uores-
cent nano particles) to the pollen grains of dierent
owers, I would like a postdoctoral fellow to document
the structure of pollen landscapes and whether variation
in oral morphology aects that structure. Finally, I
would like the postdoc to investigate the reproductive
consequences of having structured pollen landscapes on
pollinators and whether owers are able to alter those
landscapes to their advantage.
REQUIREMENTS & VALUE: The postdoc fellow will
be based at Stellenbosch University, South Africa where
he/she will use several of the local study systems to
address the above aims. The ability to use quantum
dots to study the fates of pollen grains is fairly novel
and each species that we have worked on has its own
idiosyncratic diculties to overcome. Application of
quantum dots can be ddly work and requires ne mo-
tor skills, a good deal of patience, attention to detail,
and the ability to troubleshoot and improvise. I am
looking for a postdoc with an interest in pollinators or
oral evolution, who enjoys working outdoors and isstatistically strong. The initial postdoc is for one year
(starting August 2020) with the possibility of a second
year if good headway is made. The fellow will be paid
a total of R250000 p.a. which can be used for living
expenses (this should allow for a reasonably comfort-
able standard of living). I will cover all of the project
running costs. Please note that postdoctoral fellows
are not appointed as employees and are therefore not
eligible for employee benets. Postdoctoral fellowships
are also awarded tax free. Candidates are required to
have graduated within the last 5 years.
HOW TO APPLY: Please send your applications to
me, Bruce Anderson (banderso.bruce@gmail.com). The
application should include a brief cover letter of why
you would like to work on this project and why you
think you would be a good candidate for the position.
In addition, please send an up to date CV and two
reference letters. Applications need to reach me by 1
May 2020.

uses computational and statistical methods to inves-
tigate questions in human evolutionary genetics, in
particular on mutation rate, demographic inference
and archaic ancestry. A central aim in the lab is to
understand the impact of evolutionary history on
genetic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and disease. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human
history, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomic
datasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.
Required qualications: Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics,
genomics, computational biology or related elds and
demonstrated record of productivity and publications.
Experience with programming (e.g. C/C++, Python/
Perl, R or other programming languages), genomic data
analysis and methods development.
Please contact Priya with your CV and a brief overview
of research questions you are interested in pursuing.
Please also request three recommenders to send a letter

freedom to design their project in consultation with the
advisors, and the project can range from theoretical
methods development to empirical data analysis. Re-
search topics can include: 1) Utilizing trait-association
data from metabolic, neurological and anthropometric
studies to learn about the evolution of complex traits in
ancient genomes from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze
Age and Iron Age; 2) Developing methods to detect
genes under positive selection when working with multi-
ple populations related to each other in complex ways;
3) Searching for functional variants that were positively
selected in humans over time during major cultural tran-
sitions, like the advent of agriculture; 4) Testing among
dierent models of evolution on trait-associated variants
over time.
The fully-funded position is for 3 years, and the project
will be carried out at the new Lundbeck Foundation
Centre for GeoGenetics, a unique center of researchexcellence in Denmark, with the aim to understand the
evolution of complex traits and diseases using ancient
DNA. The Centre is located in the newly created Globe
Institute at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.

UCSanDiego ViralSpeciation
Postdoc position studying viral speciation
* Use synthetic biology technologies to measure a viral
tness landscape that leads to speciation
*Experimentally test the roles genetic architecture, gene
ow, and resource competition play during speciation
Recent bioinformatic analyses have found that viruses,
like cellular life, form into species according to the Bio-
logical Species Concept (1). This nding is remarkable
because it suggests that a single universal species con-
cept can be applied to all life forms and that there are
universal principals governing the evolution of biodiver-
sity through the process of speciation. This discovery
also opens new opportunities to interrogate the process
of speciation. Viruses rapidly evolve and even their spe-
ciation can be observed in action during the course of
laboratory experiments. This provides researchers a new
opportunity to run controlled experiments on the speci-
ation process. In a paper published by Science in 2016,
we showed that bacteriophage lambda rapidly speciates,
even under sympatric conditions (2). Now we plan to
continue this research supported by the National Sci-
ence Foundation. There is a postdoc position available
to use a new technology called MAGE-Seq to measure
the structure of lambda's tness landscape and to com-
putationally simulate evolution on that landscape (3).
Additional computational and lab-based experiments
are proposed to test the roles genetic architecture, gene
ow, and resource competition play on speciation.

PhD position in evolutionary biology, social supergene
maintenance, University of Lausanne
A Ph.D. position in evolutionary biology is available
in the group of Prof. Michel Chapuisat at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne,
Switzerland. The group studies social evolution. We are
currently investigating the evolution and maintenance of
a supergene controlling social organization in ants. Our
approach combines genomics, genetics, behavioral ex-
periments and ecological surveys in the eld. For more
information, seehttp://www.unil.ch/dee/page7000.html
. Animal societies vary greatly in social organization, yet
the genomic, behavioral and ecological processes causing
this diversity are poorly understood. The Alpine silver
ant Formica selysi provides an ideal system to study the
evolution of alternative social organization, because a
supergene 'V a large group of linked genes 'V determines
whether the colony has one or multiple queens. The
successful candidate will perform experiments to better
understand the genomic, behavioral and/or ecological
factors contributing to the maintenance of this social
polymorphism.
Your qualications: In order to complete our team, we
are looking for someone with a Master's degree in bi-
ology, life sciences, genetics, bioinformatics, or related
subjects. Applicants should have knowledge and skills

The Mathieson lab is searching for 1-2 postdoctoral re-
searchers to work on projects using both ancient and
modern DNA to investigate the evolution and architec-
ture of complex traits in humans, in two broad areas:
1) Using ancient DNA to detect selection on complex
traits. Can we develop methods to detect selection in an-
cient DNA? How did humans adapt to the agricultural
transition? What is the role of polygenic adaptation
in human evolution? How can we integrate genetic,
archaeological and anthropological data?
2) Understanding the use and transferability of polygenic
risk scores. Why do PRS not transfer across popula-
tions? Can we improve on the design of PRS? How do
population structure, selection and demographic history
aect PRS?
We are also very open to suggestions for other research
projects in the broad area of human population and
statistical genetics, including demographic inference,
mutation rate evolution and analysis of biobank data.
Researchers with interest or experience in human ge-
netics and a PhD in computational biology, com-
puter science, statistics, population/statistical genet-
ics, or another relevant eld are encouraged to ap-
ply.Programming experience (ideally in R or Python)

Sep14-18
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 2nd edition of the
Physalia course on Big data Biogeography Species oc-
currences through space and time.
When: 14-18 September 2020
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany)
Instructors: Dr. Alex Zizka (German Centre for Integra-tive Biodiversity Research (iDiv) in Leipzig, Germany)
and Dr. Daniele Silvestre ( University of Lausanne,
Switzerland)
The public availability of large-scale species distribution
data has increased drastically over the last ten years.
In particular, due to the aggregation of records from
museums and herbaria, and citizen science in public
databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility (GBIF). This is leading to a 'big data' revolu-
tion in biogeography, which holds an enormous but still
poorly explored potential for understanding large scale
patterns and drivers of biodiversity in space and time.
After this course, students will be able to:
Obtain and prepare large scale species occurrence114 EvolDir March 1, 2020
records from public databases in R (including data min-
ing, data cleaning and exploration)
Apply novel methods for handling and processing 'big
data' in biogeographic research, including area classi-
cation, bioregionalization and automated conservation
assessments
Reconstruct species ancestral ranges based on species
occurrences and phylogenetic trees, using dierent evo-
lutionary models
Understand the potential and caveats of fossil based
biogeography, and be familiar with novel methods to
estimate ancestral ranges and evolutionary rates from
ranges of extinct and extant taxa

When: 25-29 May
Instructors: Dr. Michael Matschiner and Dr. Milan
Malinsky (University in Basel, Switzerland)
While genomic data promise unprecedented insights into
the evolution of the tree of life, they also pose new chal-
lenges that must be addressed to avoid misleading results
and to fully leverage the potential of the genome-scale
data sets. These challenges include the identication of
orthologuous sequences that are suitable as phylogenetic
markers, the selection of appropriate models of sequence
evolution, and the detection of gene-tree discordance due
to incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. In this
workshop we will present theory and exercises to infer
time-calibrated phylogenies from multi-locus, RADseq,
and whole-genome data sets while accounting for these
confounding factors.

Course Overview
Next generation sequencing has revolutionized evolu-
tionary biology allowing unprecedented resolution and
insight into evolutionary questions that appeared in-
tractable only a few years ago. The course will cover
the basics of population genomic analysis from SNP
data onwards and will cover the key analyses that may
be required to successfully analyze a population ge-
netic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-
nomic analysis and be competent in population genomic
analysis.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
This course is aimed at postgraduate students and early
career researchers who are interested in using population
genomic tools in their research. No previous experience
of bioinformatics is required, but an underpinning in
evolutionary biology and basic population genetics con-
cepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and FST
are desirable. The course will use a range of software
including the Linux operating system and R.

COURSE OVERVIEW: Genome-wide association stud-
ies have become increasingly popular to identify asso-
ciations between genetic risk factors and phenotypic
traits. This introductory course is addressed to medical
students, social scientists and biologists without formal
training in the eld. The aim of the course is to provide
a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. In addition
to the illustration of the standard GWAS process, we
will also demonstrate how to perform functional enrich-
ment and apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis in
order to provide individual ^A ©\level scores of genetic
risk. A mix of theoretical background and hands ^A ©\on
experience will walk students through a series of increas-
ingly complex data manipulation and visualization tasks.
These exercises will be based on PLINK, PRSice, and R,
among others, which are commonly used, freely available
software tools that are accessible for novice users.
PROGRAM: Monday Morning: - Introduction to Unix
and R (theoretical) - The process of GWAS (Introduc-
tion, Study designs, genomic controls, LD, sample size,
power) - GWAS Catalog Afternoon: - Getting the data
and starting (SNP array genotyping)
Tuesday Morning: - Quality Control (QC) for GWAS -
Variant identication - Population stratication - HWE
- MAF Afternoon: - Imputation (Michigan Imputation
Server)
Wednesday Morning: - Basic association analyses - Sta-
tistical tests (PLINK, multiple testing, binary or contin-
uous phenotype, covariates, etc) - Discovery and replica-
tion studies - Gene-based analysis. Bioinformatic follow-
up of results to explore functional mechanism (Pascal,
Magnum, FUMA GWAS) Afternoon: - PracticalThursday Morning: - Annotation of Genomic Variants
(LocusZoom, CADD) - Use of summary statistics Af-
ternoon: - Genetic risk scores (LDSC, Heritability ex-
plained, PRS)
Friday Morning: - Wrap-up - Hands-on training. Per-
form an association test from scratch

Advanced Python for biologists (APYB04)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/advanced-
python-biologists-apyb04/ This course will be delivered
by Dr Martin Jones from the 29th June - 3rd Julyin
Glasgow City Centre.
Course overview:Python is a dynamic, readable language
that is a popular platform for all types of bioinformatics
work, from simple one-o scripts to large, complex soft-
ware projects. This workshop is aimed at people who
already have a basic knowledge of Python and are in-
terested in using the language to tackle larger problems.
In it, we will look in detail at the parts of the language
which are particularly useful in scientic programming,
and at the tools Python oers for making development
faster and easier. The course will use examples and
exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics
work. After completing the workshop, students should
be in a position to (1) take advantage of the advanced
language features in their own programs and (2) use
appropriate tools when developing software programs.

https://www.prinformatics.com/course/python-for-
data-science-machine-learning-and-scientic-computing-
pdms02/ This course will be delivered by Dr Mark
Andrews from the4th - 8th May in Glasgow City
Centre.
Course Overview:Python is one of the most widely used120 EvolDir March 1, 2020
and highly valued programming languages in the world,
and is especially widely used in data science, machine
learning, and in other scientic computing applications.
This course provides both a general introduction to pro-
gramming with Python and a comprehensive introduc-
tion to using Python for data science, machine learning,
and scientic computing. The major topics that we
will cover include the following: the fundamentals of
general purpose programming in Python; using Jupyter
notebooks as a reproducible interactive Python program-
ming environment; numerical computing using numpy;
data processing and manipulations using pandas; data
visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot, bokeh,
altair, etc; symbolic mathematics using sympy; data sci-
ence and machine learning using scikit-learn, keras, and
tensorow; Bayesian modelling using PyMC3 and PyS-
tan; high performance computing with Cython, Numba,
IPyParallel, Dask. Overall, this course aims to provide a
solid introduction to Python generally as a programming
language, and to its principal tools for doing data sci-
ence, machine learning, and scientic computing. (Note
that this course will focus on Python 3 exclusively given
that Python 2 has now reached it end of life).

Bioinformatics with Linux and Python (BILP01)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/bioinformatics-
with-linux-and-python-bilp01/ This course will be
delivered by Dr Martin Jones from the11th-15th May
in Glasgow City
CentreCourse Overview:A fundamental part of bioin-
formatics (in contrast to simply computational biology)
is the idea of scaling and automation. We want to ar-
range our tools into pipelines which can be executed
with minimal supervision. Reliable automation of this
type is key to many of the things that we want from
our analyses; chiey the ability to reproduce our results,
and to extend them to other datasets.In this course we
will examine two dierent systems for automating bioin-
formatic analyses. For situations where we are mostly
running existing command line tools, bash scripting
will allow us to build pipelines with minimal overhead.
We'll start with simple command lines and see how the
Linux environment ' though not designed with biology
in mind ' is well suited to the type of automation we
need.For situations where we don't have an existing
tool available, and hence need to implement our own
logic, bash quickly becomes unwieldy ' it's theoretically
possible to write complex programs in bash, but the
experience is painful! It's much better to use a more
modern programming language, and for most biological
tasks Python ts the bill.

Course: Seascape Genomics
Where: Laval University, Quebec City (Canada)
When: 12-16 October 2020
Instructors: Dr. Laura Benestan (University of Mont-
pellier, FR) and Oliver Selmoni (EPFL, CH)
In this course , students will learn the basics of this ap-
proach and train using state of the art methods. Firstly,
students will learn how to extract environmental data
from publicly available databases and how to use it to
characterize the seascape structure and conditions. For
instance, students will learn how to use remote sensing
data to describe sea water temperature oscillations or
sea water movements. Next, the course will bring its
focus on genomic analyses: students will learn how to
evaluate genetic structures in the marine environment
and how to calculate and display connectivity between
populations. The combination of environmental and
genomic data will also lead to the study of local adapta-tion. Students will learn dierent methods to discover
genetic/genomic signatures potentially involved in adap-
tation against specic environmental constraints. The
course will also cover the critical task of the interpre-
tation and validation of the results, particularly in an
applied conservation and management context. Finally,
the workshop will consider the crucial aspects and good
habits to account for designing a seascape genomics ex-
periment (e.g. sampling design) from a relevant scientic
question.

scientists in computational methods used in evolutionary
and ecological research.
EMSI brings together internationally recognized experts
in evolutionary biology with students and health prac-
titioners who want to apply these perspectives to can-
cer, infectious disease, evolution of microbial resistance,
neurology, autoimmune disease, the microbiome, and
more. Lectures on key concepts are complimented with
hands-on computational exercises. Our goal is to give
participants the background on evolutionary principles

Rosa GJ<rgarciajunco@gmail.com >Switzerland TamingTheBEAST
May31-Jun5
Dear colleagues,
This is a reminder that the March 1 registration deadline
for the Taming the BEAST summer school is quickly ap-
proaching. If you, your research colleagues or students
are intending to apply for this workshop, please ensure
this happens before the deadline. We have already had
very strong interest in the workshop, and places are
strictly limited.
Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in
modern biology. Phylogenetic inferences reconstruct the
evolutionary relationships between organisms, whereas
phylodynamic inferences reveal the dynamics that lead
to the observed relationships. These two elds have
many practical applications in disciplines such as epi-
demiology, developmental biology, paleontology, ecology
and even linguistics. However, phylogenetics and phylo-
dynamics are complex and fast-evolving elds. As such,
inference tools are not easily accessible to researchers
who are not from a computational background.
Taming the BEAST is a summer school focusing on the
BEAST2 software and consisting of a mix of invited
talks, lectures and hands-on tutorials by leading and
renowned experts in the eld (including several of the
core developers of BEAST2). The aim of this summer
school is to equip participants with the skills necessary
to condently perform their own phylogenetic and phylo-
dynamic inferences in Bayesian settings, while providing
them with a rm grasp of the theory behind those in-
ferences. Participants are also highly encouraged to
bring their own datasets along and to engage with the
organisers and speakers to address any problems specic
to their own datasets/analyses.
We welcome applications from graduate students and
early-career scientists in the life sciences. Preference
will be given to applicants who are not from a compu-
tational background and applicants who have already
collected/assembled a dataset that they need to analyze.
Invited speakers:
Alexei Drummond (University of Auckland) Tanja
Stadler (ETH Zurich) Remco Bouckaert (University
of Auckland) Denise Kuehnert (Max Planck Institute)
Dates: May 31 to June 5, 2020 (Deadline for registrationMarch 1, 2020 EvolDir 125
is March 1).
Place: Ober ageri, Switzerland
Registration Fee: 900 CHF (Registration fee includes
accommodation and meals).

Summary of Workshop:
The resolution in genomic data makes it possible to
not only detect divergent lineages, but also local pop-
ulation structure within them. Yet, these conated
boundaries have received little attention from those
developing genetic-based species delimitation methods,
potentially leading to mass over-splitting as genomic
data become more widely employed. These challenges
have profound implications for not only understanding
the generation and dynamics of biodiversity, but also
for conserving this diversity.
In this workshop, we will cover the foundations upon
which genetic-based inference of species boundaries are
built. In particular, we will review the history that lead
to a reliance on the multispecies coalescent (MSC) as
the primary model for species delimitation. Despite
the appeal of genome-based species discovery, we will
explain how misidentication of population structure
as putative species is an emerging key issue for applica-
tions of the MSC for species delimitation, as well as the
implications of divergence of gene ow for identifying
species boundaries.
We will then present two recently developed approaches
to address the misidentications of species that oc-
curs from confounding the structure within species
with the divergence that accumulates between species.
One approach, implemented in the program DELIN-
EATE<https://jeetsukumaran.github.io/delineate/-
#requirements >, takes a phylogenetic lineage-based
perspective to delimit species where for the rst time
speciation is modeled as an extended process in the
context of species delimitation analyses, as opposed to
being treated as an instantaneous event. The other
approach, implemented in the program DECRYPT <
https://becheler.github.io/pages/applications.html >,
employs a spatially explicit coalescent model to char-
acterize the geography of divergence to test competing
hypotheses regarding the detection of cryptic diversity.
Participants in the workshop will also receive hands-
on training with both programs, completing a series of
computer demonstrations and exercises.
These newly developed method should reduce the er-
rors with genome-based species delimitation, while also
providing a framework for gaining insights about the spe-
ciation process itself. Note the methods and associated
documentation are freely available as the software pack-
ages DELINEATE <https://jeetsukumaran.github.io/-
delineate/#requirements >and DECRYPT <https://-

Dear microbial eukaryote researchers,
We are holding an NSF and Moore Foundation funded
workshop aimed at drawing the community of protist
researchers in the United States together, from across
elds, such as oceanography, parasitology, ecology, evo-
lution and others. The intention is establishing collabo-
rative goals and research objectives for the next decade,
and determine how the community might better coa-
lesce. Our hope is to gather people working in diverse
microbial eukaryotic systems, to identify community
priorities and then to establish collaborations to achieve
these goals. We are inviting applications to ll a limited
number of remaining seats to participate in this two day
workshop.
The workshop will be held on April 3rd and 4th in
Washington DC, at the Phillips Gallery in Dupont Cir-
cle. Prior to the meeting we will hold a one hour long
virtual session to orient everyone to the goals of the
workshop. If you apply to attend the workshop, your
participation in the virtual session and the two days
of in-person activities is expected. Through NSF and
Moore Foundation support of the workshop, there is
no registration fee. Please send an NSF style CV anda paragraph on why you would like to participate by
Friday, February 28st, to protistworkshop@gmail.com.
There is a limited budget for travel subsidy, so please
indicate whether you would like to be considered for
this.

The 2020 Workshop on Molecular Evolution at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mas-
sachusetts, USA, will be held *** MAY 31 to JUNE 10
*** (note that this is earlier than past years).
The deadline for applications *** has been extended to
FEBRUARY 26, 2020 *** : see https://ws2.mbl.edu/-
studentapp/studentapp.asp?courseid=mole Founded
in 1988, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution is the
longest-running workshop of its kind. The Workshop is
the premier program for integrating the methods, theory,
and applications of molecular phylogenetics, statistical
genetics, molecular evolution, and related disciplines.
Students work closely with internationally-recognized
scientists, receiving: (i) high-level instruction in the
principles of molecular evolution, phylogenetic inference,
and evolutionary genomics; (ii) advanced training in sta-
tistical methods best suited to modern datasets; and (iii)
hands-on experience with the latest software tools (often
from the authors of the programs they are using). The
material is delivered via lectures, discussions, and bioin-
formatic exercises motivated by contemporary topics
in molecular evolution. A hallmark of this workshop is
the direct interaction between students and eld-leading
scientists. The workshop serves graduate students, post-
docs, and established faculty from around the world
seeking to apply the principles of molecular evolution to
questions of both basic and applied biological sciences.
A priority of this workshop is to foster an environment
where students can learn from each other as well from128 EvolDir March 1, 2020
the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to use
the following software to address questions concerning
the origins, maintenance, and function of molecular vari-
ation: ASTRAL, BEST, FASTA, FigTree, IQTree, MI-
GRATE, MAFFT, MP-EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML,
PAUP*, SVD Quartets, and SNaQ. Students will have
the opportunity to work with software on their own
laptops as well as receive training on how to use the
same programs on a computer cluster.
In 2020 the course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joe
Bielawski, Jeremy Brown, Minh Bui, Belinda Chang,Scott Edwards, Deise Goncalves, Kelley Harris, Tracy
Heath, John Huelsenbeck, Lacey Knowles, Laura Ku-
batko, Aki Laruson, Paul Lewis, Emily Jane McTavish,
Claudia Solis-Lemus, Ed Susko, David Swoord, Katie
Taylor, George Tiley, and Anne Yoder.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.March 1, 2020 EvolDir 129
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
