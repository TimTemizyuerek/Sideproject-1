Dear Colleague,
We are pleased to announce that the 29th International
Ethological Conference (IEC) will be held in Budapest
(Hungary). The conference will take place in the new
building of E¨ otv¨ os University on the Danube riverbank
near Budapest city centre between August 20-27 2005.
The IEC has a long tradition of attracting ethologists,
comparative psychologist, neuroethologists, cognitive
scientists and behavioural ecologists from all over the
world. The IEC is organised every second year and the
last conference was in Brazil 2003. Given the contin-
uously growing interest in behavioural research we ex-
pect good number of people to attend our conference.
Note that Budapest sits in convenient distances from
Vienna and Prague, and it is one of the most beautiful
cities in Central Europe.
We would be pleased if your research will be repre-
sented at our conference. Please visit our website at
http://www.behav.org/IEC The deadline for abstract
submission is 1st April 2005
Sincerely yours,
Organising Committee jointly with the Hungarian

EmergingGenomeData Aug15-20
10th congress of the European Society for Evolutionary
Biology, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland from
15 to 20 August 2005
We would like to encourage applications for the follow-
ing symposium:
’Emerging genome data: lessons for ecology and evolu-
tion’
Abstract: Recent genome sequences have radically af-
fected our perception of how genes and genomes evolve,
but arguably have had less impact on organismal ecol-
ogy and evolution. One limitation is that understand-
ing evolution requires adequate taxon sampling, yet so
far most sequenced genomes have been conﬁned to a few
taxonomically isolated model organisms. As emerging
genome data encompasses new branches from the tree
of life, and begins to include multiple genome sequences
from closely related species, the aim of this symposium
is to highlight genomic research and its increasing in-
ﬂuence in understanding ecology and evolution.

versity of Nottingham (angus.davison@nott.ac.uk) and

MaryCartwrightLecture London
Feb25
The Mary Cartwright Lecture, an annual event run by
the London Mathematical Society, will this year for the
ﬁrst time be in the area of statistical genetics. It will
take place in London (UK) on the afternoon of Friday
February 25. The Notice is on the web at <http:/-
/www.lms.ac.uk/meetings/MC05.html >and is repro-
duced below.
The Mary Cartwright Lecturer, Professor Elizabeth
Thompson, is coming from Seattle specially for the pur-pose. She plans to announce and describe signiﬁcant
new work. She will be supported by a companion lec-
ture by Professor Steﬀen Lauritzen. It is clear that this
will be a landmark scientiﬁc occasion, not to be missed.
All are welcome to the lectures, for which there is no
fee or registration.

beth Thompson (Depts of Statistics and Biostatistics,
Univ. of Washington, Seattle) “Relatedness, genome
sharing, and the detection of genes”
The talks by Elizabeth Thompson and Steﬀen Lau-
ritzen are concerned with the genetic analysis of large
pedigrees. A pedigree, deﬁned as a full speciﬁcation of
family relationships between a group of individuals, is
naturally represented by a directed graph. Almost ev-
ery problem associated with pedigree analysis involves a
diﬃcult computation, but algorithms for so-called local
computation on graphs allow feasible calculations to be
done, and this is the topic of the ﬁrst talk. The second
talk focuses on genome sharing arising from pedigree re-
lationships, and on using the dependence in sharing at
diﬀerent loci on a common chromosome to infer linkage
of a trait to a set of marker loci. A new way to as-
sess the evidence for linkage from unobserved genome
sharing will be discussed.
A reception will be held at De Morgan House at 6.15
pm with a dinner afterwards at Poons Restaurant, 50
Woburn Place, London WC1 at 7.15 pm. The cost will
be 25 pounds per person, inclusive of wine. Those wish-

This conference follows a similar workshop that was
held in June 2003. The subject is evolution, which is
considered at diﬀerent scales: sequences, genes, gene
families, organelles, genomes, and species. The focus
is on the mathematical and computational tools and
concepts, which form an essential basis of evolutionary
studies. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in
this area, with models and methods becoming more re-
alistic, powerful, and complex. The goal of the confer-
ence is to provide pedagogical presentations of the main
subjects in the ﬁeld, from basic principles to the cut-
ting edge, with time for discussion and debate. There
will be presentations by some of the leading experts in
the ﬁeld. Each speaker will survey a broad range of
methods, techniques and results. Young scientists will
also be selected, to give short talks or present posters.

Scope of “Progress in Plant Population Biology”
The last years have seen rapid advances in a number
of ﬁelds relevant for plant population biology. These
include molecular ecology, conservation genetics, ge-
nomics, mating systems, GIS, mathematical model-
ing, plant interactions with pollinators, herbivores,
pathogens, or seed dispersal vectors, comparative meth-
ods, and biological data bases. Several invited talks will
outline new plant population biological insights made
possible by such new advances. The meeting invites
contributions within the general context of plant pop-
ulation biology.

SUNY Stonybrook SSB 2006
Call for 2006 SymposiaMarch 1, 2005 EvolDir 7
The Society for Systematic Biologists invites proposals
for symposia at the 2006 SSB meeting to be held at
the State University of New York, Stonybrook. The
meeting will be held jointly with the American Society
of Naturalists and the Society for the Study of Evolu-
tion. Proposals should include (1) a descriptive title,
(2) one or two paragraphs explaining the purpose of
the symposium and its relevance to systematics, (3) a
list of presentations including proposed speakers, their
institutions or aﬃliations, and their presentation titles,
(4) an indication of whether the speakers have been
invited and whether they have agreed to participate,
and (5) the proposed length of each talk. Symposia are
restricted to half-day sessions. The society is particu-
larly interested in symposia whose topics do not overlap
with those from previous meetings, that introduce new
ideas or synthesize important concepts, or those that
are particularly good examples of the analysis of empir-
ical data. Proposals that unite systematics with other
ﬁelds are also desirable. We encourage participation
from young investigators and others typically under-
represented in symposia. Limited funding is available.
The target date for receipt of proposals is May 15, 2005.
Proposals will be discussed and two will be selected at
the SSB Council meeting during the 2005 annual meet-
ing in Fairbanks, Alaska. Soon after, organizers will
be notiﬁed of the status of their proposals. Proposals
should be sent by email to the Program Chairperson,

First announcement of the one-day symposium ’Struc-
ture@Sea’ on thursday, 14th of April 2005, University8 EvolDir March 1, 2005
of Amsterdam.
Marine-dwelling organisms are usually imagined to be
part of huge populations, characterized by almost un-
limited interchange. This is especially true for free-
living critters in the plankton that travel wherever the
water current takes them. Allopatric divergence and
speciation are therefore not expected to play a major
role at the spatial scales at which they typically act in
other habitats. Nonetheless, species diversity and levels
of population genetic structuring are often unexpect-
edly high. This symposium reviews the observed pat-
terns for pelagic as well as benthic organisms and dis-
cusses recent theories on the possible causes for these.

UMinnesota Genetics Apr9
Announcing the University of Minnesota Center for
Community Genetics 2005 Symposium
Saturday April 9th, 2005 in Minneapolis, Minnesota
Community Genetics and Phylogenetics Past and on-
going evolutionary and ecological processes interact to
shape the biodiversity within ecological communities as
well as the genetic diversity of their component species.
Recognition of these interactions has prompted eﬀorts
toward a synthesis of community ecology and evolution-March 1, 2005 EvolDir 9
ary genetics. This symposium explores the dynamic
interplay between ecology and genetics in the ongoing
evolution of species interactions while recognizing the
importance of history. Of special focus are the joint
roles of population processes and phylogenetic relation-
ships in community assembly and the role of community
in the divergence of species populations.
Presentations and panel discussions by seven interna-
tionally renowned ecologists and evolutionary biologists
will be followed by a poster session and a banquet at
the University of Minnesota Campus Club.
The event is free and open to the public.
Attendees are asked to register and to contribute
posters. Limited funds are available for travel expenses
of graduate students and post-docs who present posters.

Valencia MEEGID July
19/02/05
Dear Colleague,
please ﬁnd below some important news about the three
tightly-linked undertakings (journal/congress/society)
above-mentionned.
(1) The journal Infection, Genetics and Evo-
lution (Elsevier; http://www.elsevier.com/locate/-
meegid ) launched in 2001 (19th issue presently be-
ing compiled), aims to be the forum for developing
a holistic and integrated approach to the epidemiol-
ogy of transmissible diseases. This approach consid-
ers together the host, the pathogen and the vector (for
vector-borne diseases), with the tools of genetics, evo-
lutionary biology, genomics, post-genomics and bioin-
formatics. Infection, Genetics and Evolution welcomes
papers on infectious models of medical, veterinary and
agronomical relevance. All pathogens are considered:
helminths, parasitic protozoa, fungal organisms, bac-
teria, viruses, prion. Since many traits can be com-mon between them, with the goal of establishing general
laws, comparisons between diﬀerent kinds of pathogens
are encouraged,which makes possible to establish gen-
eral laws. Similarly, integrated studies including host,
pathogen and vector are encouraged. Infection, Ge-
netics and Evolution aims to favor cross-fertilization
and mutual inspiration between parasitologists, mycol-
ogists, bacteriologists, virologists, entomologists, hu-
man geneticists, molecular epidemiologists and evolu-
tionists. Infection, Genetics and Evolution has been
quoted 3.5/4.0 (“very good”) by the National Library in
Washington DC. It is now covered by medline, pubmed
and scholar.google starting from the ﬁrst issue. Just
waiting for your manuscripts!
(2) the MEEGID congresses: coorganized by the In-
stitut de Recherche pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD; the
French governmental agency for research in developing
countries), the Centre National de la Recherche Scien-
tiﬁque (CNRS; the French governmental agency for ba-
sic research) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
in Atlanta. The MEEGID congresses rely on the same
concept and have the same scope than Infection, Genet-
ics and Evolution, which publies abstracts and selected
papers from them (and from other congresses with re-
lated topics) in special issues. MEEGID VII has been
held in Valencia, Spain, July 2004 ( http://www.uv.es/-
emop9/MEEGID ). MEEGID VIII is scheduled May
2006 at the CDC in Atlanta. A “mini-MEEGID”, spe-
cialized on major parasitoses (malaria, toxoplasmosis,
sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmanioses) is
scheduled in Montpellier, France, September 2005, with
special training sessions on molecular epidemiology and
evolutionary biology for students and postdoctoral fel-
lows. Scientists and students from developing countries
will beneﬁt from reduced rates.
(3) The MEEGID society aims to support the activ-
ities of Infection, Genetics and Evolution and of the
MEEGID congresses. Members beneﬁt from free access
to the journal (the paper version) and from reduced reg-
istration fees to the MEEGID congresses. In 2005, new
activities are scheduled, including regular warning mes-
sages for hot papers and important events, discussion
forums on email and delivery of PDF articles. Time to
register!

The Department of Biology at American University
would like to oﬀer you an exciting opportunity to visit
and learn more about our graduate programs in Biol-
ogy and Environmental Sciences. We have recently in-
stituted new funding for both additional stipends and
research supplies. Qualiﬁed graduate students can now
over $20,000 a year to support their graduate educa-
tion.
We are holding a Graduate Student Open House on
Monday, February 21, 2005 for you to visit and learn
about potential research projects and graduate funding
opportunities. This day-long event is designed to fa-
miliarize you with our campus resources and give you
a better idea about the themes and goals of our Mas-
ter’s programs. At these events, there will be many
opportunities to talk with both faculty and graduate
students.
The day will start at 9 AM with a welcome and intro-
duction to the Department, followed by a tour of ourfacilities and the campus, then a luncheon with faculty
in the department. In the afternoon we will have some
short research talks from our faculty and graduate stu-
dents. At the end of the day, the graduate students will
take you out for an informal pizza social.
Please reply to Dr. Nancy Zeller, letting us know if you
plan to attend the February 21st open house by Friday,
February 18, 2005. We will also try to ﬁnd you accom-
modations with the graduate students or faculty for the
nights of the 15th or the 16th. Contact Nancy Zeller at
nzeller@american.edu or 202-885-2191. Let Dr. Zeller
know if you would like to arrange accommodations and
if you would like a copy of the agenda.
Applicants interested in funding are strongly encour-
aged to attend the Open House, as the departmental
review of applications begins in late February. Also
note that attendees are awarded waivers for their ap-
plication fees. I also encourage you to inquire about
reimbursement for your travel costs to the event! We
hope you will be able to visit and learn more about our
graduate programs. If you have any questions, please
feel free to contact Nancy Zeller at 202-885-2191. We
look forward to meeting you.

AmericanU FluctuatingAsymetry
Funded Graduate Positions
Recently, conservation biologists have been investigat-
ing the usefulness of a relatively new tool, ﬂuctuating
asymmetry (FA), for assessing the impact of environ-
mental and genetic stresses on populations. One of
the main advantages of FA is its increased sensitivity
relative to other bioindicators. If eﬀective, this tool
could allow biologists to monitor populations and make
recommendations before a severe problem arises, often
without the high cost of other solutions. I have a num-
ber of funded FA projects available for graduate stu-
dents interested in obtaining their MS degree at Amer-
ican University. Study subjects include marine mam-
mal and endangered species. The projects combine FA
data with other measures of population health to deter-
mine, on a species-by-species basis, whether FA can be
used to identify stressed populations before detrimental
population decline occurs.
Funded positions include tuition, stipend and, if
desired, hourly wages for work as a TA. Basics research
support is also provided. If interested please contact
Cathy Schaeﬀ, schaeﬀ@american.edu. Additional
information about the MS program ( http://-
www.american.edu/cas/bio/programs media/ms.html )
and the department ( http://www.american.edu/cas/-

AMERICAN UNIVERISTY would like to announce a
number of funded graduate student positions available
for projects investigating human mate choice. Straights
and gays diﬀer in the sex of their mates and it is un-
clear how that inﬂuences individuals? assessment of
mate attractiveness. Our current studies focus on fa-cial symmetry and sexually dimorphic facial features,
both of which inﬂuence human perception of individual
attractiveness.
Funding for MS graduate students includes tu-
ition remission, stipend and, if desired, hourly
wages for work as a TA. Basics research support is
also provided. If interested please contact Cathy

Using single chromosome transfers between yeast
species to identify the genetic bases of reproductive iso-
lation
Saccharomyces cerevisiae can mate with other Saccha-
romyces sensu stricto species, but the resulting hybrids
are sterile, producing inviable gametes. The sterility
is caused, in part, by genes from one species that are
incompatible with genes from the other (Greig et al
2002). Such recessive hybrid incompatibilities are often
called speciation genes. This project will identify chro-
mosomes carrying speciation genes. We will transfer
single chromosomes from Saccharomyces paradoxus to
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine whether or not
each is compatible. The method to be used is modiﬁed
from Chambers et al (1996). A genomic library will
then be screened to identify the incompatible genes.
The project will suit those with good laboratory skills
and an interest in evolutionary genetics.

UGroningen 2 EvolGenetics
In the Evolutionary Genetics Group, Centre for Ecolog-
ical and Evolutionary Studies (CEES) in the Faculty of
Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of
Groningen, two PhD positions are available:
1. Ph.D position in evolutionary genetics for studying
the genetic basis of inbreeding depression
We are looking for a Ph.D. student for a research
project that aims to elucidate the nature of the
genes that cause inbreeding depression in model insect
species.
Job description Inbreeding depression is currently an
important phenomenon in conservation genetics, but is
also considered as a main driving force for evolutionary
processes such as recombination, the evolution of sex,
the evolution of mating systems, etc. Inbreeding de-
pression has been documented to occur in many organ-
isms and has been shown to aﬀect the survival proba-
bility of populations. Nevertheless, even today remark-
ably little is known about the nature of the genes caus-
ing inbreeding depression. Considering the new devel-
opments in the analyses of complex traits, such as QTL
analysis and several omics-techniques, it is now timely
to tackle this problem. We like to address a number of
basic questions on the genetic architecture of inbreeding
depression in two model systems with diﬀerent repro-
ductive modes, the diploid fruitﬂy Drosophila and the
haplodiploid wasp Nasonia. Questions will focus on de-
termining the number of genes involved, the nature of
these genes (major and minor, dominance vs overdom-
inance), and the mode of expression of these genes (sex
speciﬁc, epistasis , conditional).
This PhD project will be linked to on ongoing collabo-
rative project with the Department of ecology and Ge-
netics (Prof. V. Loeschcke) of University of Aarhus
(DK) on part of the same issues.
Ph.D position for four years We are looking for a mas-
ters or equivalent degree in biology with preferably astrong background in population and evolutionary ge-
netics. The project is expected to be very demanding
and asks for a very creative mind. The candidate should
have a strong interest in molecular and evolutionary ge-
netics research and aﬃnity with experimental work on
insects. Good proﬁciency of the English language is
required. The candidate is supposed to attend a few
graduate courses ( <10% of time). The project should
result in a Ph.D. thesis. We oﬀer a four year position
with an annual stipend of Euro 17000. The position is
open to all EU members and aﬃliates , except Dutch-
men
The group The Evolutionary Genetics group is part
of the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies
(CEES) in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sci-
ences of the University of Groningen. Areas of research
include evolution of reproductive systems, conservation
genetics and life-history evolution; main model organ-
isms are Drosophila and parasitic wasps. Research into
the consequences of genetic erosion and inbreeding de-
pression for the persistence of endangered species is a
major research line of the group. The group provides
a lively, internationally oriented, scientiﬁc environment
with excellent facilities. The group takes part in the
National Research School “Functional Ecology” which
oﬀers advanced courses in ecology and evolution.

2. Ph.D position in evolutionary genetics for studying
sex determination in Nasonia
We are looking for a Ph.D. student for our research
project on the genetic mechanisms of sex determina-
tion in the haplodiploid wasp Nasonia. The project
is funded by the Netherlands Scientiﬁc Organisation
(NWO).
Job description Haplodiploidy is a mode of repro-
duction that occurs in a number groups (e.g. Hy-
menoptera): males are haploid, females are diploid and
heteromorphic sex chromosomes are absent. There is
a longstanding interest in elucidating the underlying
genetic mechanisms of haplodiploid sex determination.
In this project, we like to address if sex determination18 EvolDir March 1, 2005
cascades in Hymenoptera compare to those of other in-
sects. The research will focus on determining the num-
ber and nature of genes involved in sex determination of
the parasitic wasp Nasonia. This species is an emerging
model organism for analysing complex traits, is easy to
culture and handle, and a number of genetic tools and
mutant lines are available. It is to be expected that its
entire genome sequence will be available soon. You will
use genetic, cytogenetic and molecular

UHawaiiManoa InsectConservation
Insect Conservation on top of a Volcano Life history,
evolution, population structure, and conservation man-
agement of the Wekiu Bug
Position Announcement Graduate Research Assis-
tantship in Insect Conservation, Ecology and Evolution
Period: To begin approximately August 15, 2005, for 1
year. Renewable annually for up to 4 years, contingent
upon progress.
Background: The wekiu bug (Nysius wekiuicola) is re-
stricted to cinder substrate habitat between 11,715 and
13,796 feet on the slopes of the Mauna Kea volcano,
Hawaii Island. The current and historic population
sizes of the wekiu bug are not known, although lower
numbers during recent trapping eﬀorts suggest that the
species may be in decline, possibly due to development
of Astronomy research facilities. In addition to conser-
vation management, the study system presents many
interesting evolutionary questions. The wekiu bug is a
ﬂightless predator of dead or dying insects blown up on
to the snowﬁelds that blanket the volcano periodically
in the winter and spring. A putative sister species oc-
curs on the neighboring Mauna Loa volcano, but both
may be independently derived from a lowland, volant,
herbivorous ancestor. Because the wekiu bug appears
dependent on speciﬁc cinder conditions and snowfall, it
may be limited to particular sections of the volcano, and
persist in genetically substructured populations. Du-
ties: Assess the impacts of habitat alteration on Wekiu
bug populations including the development of rigor-
ous quantitative ﬁeld experiments. Develop laboratory-rearing protocols and discover natural history traits in-
cluding fecundity, phenology, and habitat preference.
Use molecular techniques to understand evolution and
population structure. Will be responsible for designing
and conducting laboratory experiments at UH Manoa,
and ﬁeldwork on the Mauna Kea Volcano on the Big
Island of Hawaii.
Minimum Qualiﬁcations Bachelor’s degree in a bio-
logical science from an accredited university or col-
lege with a minimum 3.0 GPA, and competitive GRE
scores. A strong background and/or interest in insect
biology, and/or molecular biology, population model-
ing and/or conservation is highly desirable. Student
must be in excellent physical condition since ﬁeld-
work will occur at very high elevations, and often un-
der cold conditions. Approximately 30 days of ﬁeld-
work per year. Must be accepted in the Entomol-
ogy Graduate Program (MS or PhD) at the Univer-
sity of Hawaii, Manoa. Salary: $15,558 - $25,000
per year depending on qualiﬁcations and degree pur-
sued (MS/PhD), plus beneﬁts, tuition waiver and ﬁeld
and laboratory research funding, including inter-island
travel. To Apply: Must be admitted to the Univer-
sity of Hawaii Graduate School (requires application,
GRE, see: http://www.hawaii.edu/graduatestudies/-
admissions/html/admissions.htm ). Send letter of ap-
plication, informal transcript, list of GRE scores (Gen-
eral test), and names and contact information for 3 aca-
demic references to Dr. Daniel Rubinoﬀ, Department

PhylogenomicsWorkﬂow
A WORKFLOW FOR PHYLOGENOMICS: STUDY-
ING AND CAPTURING HOW PEOPLE WORK
A BBSRC-funded* PhD studentship for a bioin-
formatics project at the University of Manchester
(www.manchester.ac.uk ) to start September 2005.
Molecular phylogenetics, or phylogenomics when ap-
plied to complete genomes, is central to the appropri-
ate analysis of genomic data and in particular to com-
parative studies, because it is evolution that explains
the relationships between divergent genomes. Further-
more, to fully understand the evolution of viruses, ge-
nomic data is the only available information for study.
Unfortunately, much research eﬀort, often of signiﬁ-
cant medical importance, is performed on similar data
sets by distributed researchers using disparate and oc-
casionally ﬂawed analysis methodologies. Thus, deci-
sions made by a researcher can have an impact on the
outcome of the analysis to the extent that conﬂicting
phylogenetic relationships are obtained (for an example
see Worobey et al., 2002). The aim of this project is toimplement and standardise a computer-based workﬂow
that captures best practise for the appropriate phyloge-
netic and statistical analysis of comparative data sets.
The implementation and management of the workﬂow
will make use of Grid-enabled middleware, myGrid, an
EPSRC e-Science project at the University of Manch-
ester (Stevens et al., 2004).
Informal enquiries can be addressed to the
PhD project supervisors: Dr. David Robertson
(david.robertson@manchester.ac.uk) or Dr. Robert
Stevens (robert.stevens@manchester.ac.uk). MSc in
Bioinformatics or Computational Biology preferred, or
equivalent experience.

PhD position: Computational Evolutionary Biology
I (Guy Hoelzer) am seeking a new PhD student to work
on computational modeling and analysis of the spatial
architecture of gene pools. There are a great many open
questions to be addressed regarding the inﬂuence of iso-
lation by distance on evolutionary dynamics (the rates
and localization of evolutionary processes) and spa-
tial self-organization (symmetry breaking in spatially
manifested dynamical systems) in biological systems,
so there is ﬂexibility in the particular set of questions
to be addressed in this student’s dissertation. For ex-
ample, the dissertation could focus primarily either on
theory development through the systematic exploration
of well-deﬁned, generic conditions, or on speciﬁc situ-20 EvolDir March 1, 2005

We are seeking a highly motivated individual interested
in pursuing a PhD degree in Bioinformatics within an
ongoing research project on development of Analytical
Methods for Genetic Dissection of Multifactorial traits.
A suitable candidate will be oﬀered a four year PhD
student position with the full beneﬁts of employees at
the University.Most complex traits and disorders in humans (e.g. dia-
betes and cardiovascular disease), animals (e.g. growth
and fat deposition) and plants (e.g. disease resistance
and yield) have a multifactorial rather than monogenic
background. A better understanding of the underly-
ing mechanisms of these traits is needed for applica-
tions in ﬁelds such as medicine, evolutionary biology
and agriculture. By studying the associations or link-
age between genetic markers and relevant phenotypes,
chromosomal segments harbouring genes aﬀecting the
phenotype (Quantitative Trait Loci or QTL) can be
identiﬁed. This PhD sudent project is part of a larger,
ongoing eﬀort to develop novel methods for identify-
ing QTL in various types of populations with an aim
to better understand the genetic mechanisms underly-
ing complex trait expression. The project is part of a
collaboration between the Department of Genetics and
Pathology and the Linneaus Centre for Bioinformat-
ics at Uppsala University. Currently, four other gradu-
ate students and three Post-Doc are active within the
project.
Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in ge-
netics, statistics, animal science, bioinformatics, com-
puter science, or a related ﬁeld. Programming skills in
UNIX, FORTRAN or C++, knowledge of QTL map-
ping, linkage mapping or genetic association studies
would be a plus.

SixMonthInternship
I have funding for a 6 month student internship in my
research group from the The International Association
for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience
(IAESTE; www.iaeste.org ). Candidates must be regis-
tered at a university or other center for advanced stud-
ies in order to qualify for the grant, and furthermore
they must provide a letter which shows that they would
be returning to their university after this internship.
I am presently setting up a research group to study
the evolution of asexual reproduction (apomixis) in the
plant genera Boechera and Hypericum. The proposed
internship in my lab would be to primarily work on the
optimization and analysis of microsatellite variation in
Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort). The work
would include standard laboratory methods (DNA ex-
traction, PCR preparation, etc.) followed by analyses
using an automated genetic analysis system. The can-
didate should also be comfortable with computers since
much of the downstream work will involve genetic anal-
ysis software.
My lab is found in the department of Cytogeneticsat the Institute for Plant Genetics and Crop Plant
Research (IPK) in Gatersleben, Germany ( www.ipk-
gatersleben.de ). This internationally-recognized insti-
tute has a wonderful array of resources in widely dif-
ferent areas of plant research. Gatersleben is a small
village found near the Harz Mountains, and is approx-
imately 2 hours from Berlin and 1 hour from Leipzig
and Halle. Check out the following web sites for more

ABI CEQ opinions
Dear colleagues,
I’m putting together a proposal to acquire some
sort of automated genotyper (for microsatellite anal-
ysis), probably either a Beckman-Coulter CEQ 8000
(which I have some experience with) or an ABI Prism
3100 or 3100 Avant (with which I am completely
unfamiliar). I would greatly appreciate the opin-
ions/recommendations as to which system people pre-
fer (if anybody is familiar with both systems), and/or
how you like the ABI genotyper. My main considera-
tions include reliability, and approximate running cost
per sample. superfast throughput is not so important.
Please reply to emacdoug@uwo.ca , thanks in advance
for any thoughts on this! Cheers, Beth MacDougall-
Shackleton

ABI3700 PeakHeights
Dear Evoldir members,
We are using several microsatellite loci to estimate out-
crossing and gene ﬂow rates in the perennial herbaceous
plant, Aquilegia coerulea. While examining our data in
Genotyper, we have seen a good deal of variation in therelative peak heights for heterozygotes at our loci. For
any given plant, we can ﬁnd one of three peak height
distributions: 1. The shorter allele is taller than the
longer allele. 2. The longer allele is taller than the
shorter allele. 3. The peaks are equal in height
Ideally, we would like all of our plants to have the third
distribution, but some plants have the ﬁrst, and other
plants have the second distribution. Although diﬀering
among individual plants, these distributions will stay
consistent for particular individuals on repeat runs (in-
cluding when changing the number of PCR cycles from
40 to 30).
One major problem is that the ratio of tall peak to
small peak varies along a continuous gradient, with-
out any obvious cutoﬀ point. This makes it diﬃcult to
designate a minimum peak height below which we will
ignore a peak (e.g., 1/3 the height of the taller peak),
without the designation being arbitrary and without
generating a good number of borderline cases.
We’re hoping to do paternity analysis and so have little
room for error. If anyone has had similar experiences
and knows of techniques that might help even out our
peak heights, we’d be very grateful.

ABI3700 PeakHeights answers
Thank you to all who responded to my question about
unequal peak heights in heterozygotes following se-
quencing on an ABI 3700. Below is my original ques-
tion, followed by the answers:
We are using several microsatellite loci to estimate out-
crossing and gene ﬂow rates in the perennial herbaceous
plant, Aquilegia coerulea. While examining our data in
Genotyper, we have seen a good deal of variation in the
relative peak heights for heterozygotes at our loci. For
any given plant, we can ﬁnd one of three peak height
distributions: 1. The shorter allele is taller than the
longer allele. 2. The longer allele is taller than the
shorter allele. 3. The peaks are equal in height

————————————————–
#1: couple of thoughts on your ABI peak height prob-
lem.
If it is consistently in the same marker (and fairly reg-ular across samples) you can try 1 of 2 possibilities.
1. Reduce the number of PCR cycles in those where
the peaks are high...you seem to have a lot (40) of pcr
cycles?...for radio nucleotides I use 30-35(max) for the
ﬂuro I tend to use between 27-30. By over amplify-
ing in the PCR you could be leaving yourself open to
other problems too! 2. Try diluting the PCR product
of those samples that are too high.
Can I also ask (probably seem like a dumb question
but I am not looking at your initial copy), when you
place your DNA’s in the PCR mix are they all at the
same concentration or are you just assuming that after
extraction they will all be about the same?
#2: 1. The shorter allele is taller than the longer allele.
2. The longer allele is taller than the shorter allele. 3.
The peaks are equal in height
If I can give my opinion about your situa-
tion: If you read about ?stuttering? ( http:/-
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=-
Retrieve&db=PubMed&list uids=9300082&dopt=-
Abstract ) and according to my experience with msats
on the 377, I would say that the case number one is the
heterozyg. It is expected that the shorter allele should
be higher because it is ampliﬁed faster. Case two:
homozyg. for the longer allele. Typical of stuttering
Case three: could be any. You could rely on the stutter
pattern of the microsat to make your own idea. It’s
diﬃcult without seeing the pattern for myself.
Hoping I?ve answered your question. If stuttering is
not the problem, well, I tried. I also read your pro-
tocols, and I mights have a couple of comments if you
don?t mind me saying: Final extension: 70 deg. C -30
minutes
It seems long. I used only 5 minutes, your could try
less than 30 minutes and see if you get the same qual-
ity. - Peaks averaged several thousand ﬂuorescent units
in height, but varied considerably
There is an option to adjust the sensitivity of the read-
ing. You can adjust it after saving the run and before
the analysis. The other solution is, as I do, to dilute the
PCR product in water prior to mix it with the loading
buﬀer. You should try to keep the peaks below 1000,
as it says in the manual. When you decide to multiplex
your PCR products to save gels, the mixing will work
as a dilution and your peaks will be lower. #3: We’ve
been doing SSRs on Aquilegia seeds for some time now -
you may even be using some of our primers (see attach-
ment) or perhaps Gallaghers? In any case, I think that
the reason for your seeing diﬀerences in the intensity of
the bands (shorter versus longer diﬀering between dif-
ferent seeds) is because you have both maternal tissue40 EvolDir March 1, 2005
as well as progeny tissue in your extraction. You should
amplify both of the maternal plants alleles as well as the
paternal contribution. So, if the seed is selfed, you will
see two bands (assuming the maternal plant was a het-
erozygote). If the seed is a homozygote, whichever allele
it has will be over-represented but the other maternal
allele will still show up. With an outcrossed seed,

ABI AFLP primer sequences
Does anyone happen to know the core sequences of the
MseI and EcoRI AFLP ampliﬁcation primers provided
by ABI? I’d like to use the ABI AFLP kits for a pilot
study and then be able to synthesize additional quan-
tities of the chosen selective primers at a lower cost
elsewhere. Google searches have turned up nothing,
and I am left wondering if ABI’s primers are the same
as/diﬀerent from those I see detailed on other websites
and in published papers.

ALF sequencing
Dear All,
I will be going to another lab to use their ALF EX-
PRESS machine for some sequencing, here we have an
ABI3100.
Now although I cannot seem to ﬁnd a lot of informa-
tion on the ALF, it appears to be a mid point between
running radionucleotide gels, and the ABI set up. From
this I have several questions:-
1. Can anybody direct me to any further sources of
information on the ALF? 2. Is there any reason whycomparisons cannot be made betweent the allelic data
from one output with the other i.e. comparing popula-
tions? I plan to use several good samples that I have
run on the ABI as standards (as well as the normal
standard). 3. Any other advice that you feel might be
useful.
Many thanks,

Aggregation tests
Dear Colleagues,
We would be very interested in information on statisti-
cal tests that are capable of determining whether distri-
butions of objects (cells, animals, bird nests etc.) are
distributed randomly or in aggregated manner in the
landscape/ surface (we are only interested in 2 dimen-
sions). Our interest is to compare the tendency for
aggregation and so we need to have a statistical test
thattakes into account the distances among objects and
their coordinates (location on the surface)and an eﬀect
size estimator. Our search of the literature has not yet
landed us with exactly what we are looking for and so
we would very much appreciate any information that
you may be able to provide us with.
Please send any replies directly to the addresses below,
Thank you verymuch in advance,

Asteraceae samples
Rub´ en Torices, Jos´ e Mar´ ıa G´ omez and me (Marcos

tion of non-hermaphroditic breeding systems in Aster-March 1, 2005 EvolDir 41
aceae (yes, the whoooooole family with over 1500 gen-
era). To carry out such an ambitious project we request
your kind help in collecting for us material from some
species/areas which we cannot reach ourselves. You
can ﬁnd more information about the project, and the
protocol for the harvest at the following homepage, ap-
propriately named SEXAS:
http://www.escet.urjc.es/biodiversos/engl/science/-
sexas/eng/main.htm We just need you to send us
30 ﬂowering capitula and/or 30 fruiting capitula of
any Asteraceae species you can ﬁnd. Every species
is welcome, including Bellis perennis. If you plan to
go to Africa, Asia, America or Australia, consider
to bring some material for us, or forward this mes-
sage to any potential helper there. Most Asteraceae
are hermaphroditic (over 50%) or gynomonoecious
(35%), so most of the material we will get will be
from those breeding systems. We would appreci-
ate if you can additionally target some of the rare
breeding systems as monoecy (11%), andromonoecy
(7 genera), gynodioecy (2 genera: Cirsium and

Bremer support TreeRot
Hi,
I have been trying to use TreeRot to obtain Bremersupport on a morphology based tree. However, I’m ex-
periencing a problem. In the end of the execution of
the *.constraints ﬁle (in PAUP), I receive the following
message:
“using random trees as a starting point for branch
swapping is not allowed when enforcing topological con-
straints”.
I have tried running the example Duck tree ﬁle but the
result was the same. I have also tried using diﬀerent
Addition Sequence methods (instead of random) and
got always the same message.
Does anyone know how to overcome this problem? Or
maybe you know about another program who can also
calculate decay indexes... Help with be most appreci-
ated.
Thanks in advance, Antonio.

Bremer support TreeRot answer
Fellow colleagues,
It turned out that the problem was easier to solve than
I thought. In PAUP there’s is an option, under Par-
simony Settings, which allows us to turn of the use of
random trees. Once I did it the program TreeRot ran
without any problem. Thanks to those how answered
back for your suggestions.

Eﬀective vs census pop size answers
On January 28, 2005, I sent the following to EvolDir:
Dear colleagues,
I vaguely recall seeing a paper some years ago, perhaps
10-15, which suggested that the ratio of Ne/N is smaller
the larger is N. Can anybody give me this reference?
Many, many thanks to all who responded! The re-
sponses I received are given below for the beneﬁt of
all.
Bill
1. (This message actually identiﬁed the paper I vaguely
recalled:)
From: Charles Goodnight
<charles.goodnight@uvm.edu >
Yup. That would be me (among others) that wrote
that. It turns out that there is a strong negative re-lationship between N and Ne/N. We conﬁrmed this
experimentally, and found qualitative agreement with
published data (although diﬀerences in methodology
among studies precluded convincing quantitative com-
parisons). Aside: Note the census numbers for the gal-
lon populations. Those counts almost killed me. Pray,

2. From: Paul Moran <paul.moran@noaa.gov >
Is that Frankham 95 Genetical Research 66:95-107?
It seems, however, that the apparent inﬂuence of N
is related to mixing harmonic and arithmetic means
rather than an inherent biological phenomenon. Robin
will check my interpretation on that. He wrote about
this issue in a recent book chapter, and he and Steven
Kalinowski published a paper in Conservation Biology
(16:129-136).
3. From: Robin Waples Robin.Waples@noaa.gov
Perhaps you are thinking of Vucetich and Waite 1998
Conserv Biol. 12:1023-1030 or Vucetich et al. 1997 Evo-
lution 51:2015-2019. They showed that Ne/N declines
to an asymptote as one considers a longer time series.
However, this is the case only if one deﬁnes long term
Ne/N as the harmonic mean Ne divided by the arith-
metic mean N. Hedgecock (1994) suggested Ne/N might
be very small in some marine species. This hypothesis
is controversial, but some recent genetic estimates of
Ne in marine species support this idea. Ne and Tajima
(1981) suggested Ne/N might be low in species with
large N such as insects, but I don’t think they provided
any data.

4. From: Paul Moran <paul.moran@noaa.gov >
Thanks, Robin. As an example of your point about
Ne in marine populations (other than oysters), Lorenz
Hauser’s work on New Zealand snapper showed a really
small Ne/N ratio (I’ve forgotten just how small, but
I remember being impressed when I saw him present
those data).

5. From: Masatoshi Nei <nxm2@psu.edu >
Dear Bill,
Maybe you are referring to the Nei and Graur paper,
which was published in Evolutionary Biology in 1984.
In this paper we estimated the census size in a crude
way and eﬀective size from average heterozygosity. You
can get a copy of this paper from my website, which is
given at the bottom of the signature page of this email.
You can see that Ne/N ratio is smaller for large N.
6. From: Nicky Rivers <bgynmg@leeds.ac.uk >
Dear Bill
regarding your question below, I dont know the pa-
per but would be interested to know of the reference
if you ﬁnd it - could you post the replies on evoldir?
However there is a useful section in R. Frankham, J.D.
Ballou and D.A. Briscoe’s book ’Introduction to Con-
ervation Genetics’ which talks about the inﬂuences on
Ne/N (p241-251), however it doesnt say that larger N
per se inﬂuences the ratio, but does say ﬂuctuations in
popn size, overlapping generations, unequal sex ratio,
variations in family size and outbreeding are important
factors inﬂuencing the Ne/N ratio, so perhaps it is not
as simple as the larger the N, the smaller the Ne/N
ratio?
Nicola Rivers
7. From: Rich Strauss <Rich.Strauss@ttu.edu >
No, but to the extent that Ne is roughly constant among
populations (or time), then Ne/N and N are propor-
tional to reciprocals.

Ernst Mayr passing
Ernst Mayr, perhaps the most inﬂuential evolutionist
in the world during the 20th century, died on Thurs-
day, February 3, 2005. He was well into his 100th year,
enjoying good health until near the end. In hand were
several more manuscripts that he would have publishedhad he lived longer.
Mayr’s inﬂuence was wide and deep. His two major
works on evolution and systematics (Mayr 1942, 1963)
are still read today. He was a constant innovator of
systematic nomenclature (Mayr 1978). Mayr’s books
on the history of biology (Mayr and Provine, 1980,
Mayr 1982), and on the philosophy of biology (Mayr
1988) had a major inﬂuence on both ﬁelds. Between
Mayr and Richard C. Lewontin, Harvard’s Museum of
Comparative Zoology became the center of training for
young historians and philosophers of biology.
Mayr was a forceful writer, and never hesitated to chal-
lenge his colleagues. Naturally, he had many detractors,
whom he relished. His ideas endured much criticism
from me, but he never wavered as a friend and advisor.
The worst thing, he claimed, was being ignored. After
roundly criticizing the contributions of population ge-
netics to evolutionary biology (Mayr 1959), Mayr later
nominated Sewall Wright for the Balzan Prize, and at-
tended the award ceremony in Italy when Wright won
the prize. When Theodosius Dobzhansky published
his Genetics and the Origin of Species in 1937, Mayr
pointed out to him with glee that the ﬁgure of a cell
division on the spine of the book had the chromosomes
backward (Dobzhansky was an accomplished cytologist,
and had not noticed).
Finally, no notice of his death has mentioned his prodi-
gious production of correspondence over his lifetime.
He answered nearly every letter that reached him, and
initiated much correspondence. His inﬂuence through
correspondence will have to be evaluated in the future
and I predict it will be immense.

Individual genetic distances
Hi there, I’m currently trying to ﬁnish my master’s the-
sis and I’ve run into a problem with my analysis. I have
microsatellite data for 9 loci for a single population that
contains 1) bisexual species and 2) related unisexual hy-
brids. I want to generate a genetic distance matrix at
an individual level for my multi-locus genotype data,
that will allow me to compare graphically the genetic
relatedness between the hybrids and sympatric bisex-
uals. However, I can’t seem to ﬁnd a program that
will allow me to generate a genetic distance matrix for
genotype data at an individual level (as compared to
a sub-population level through allele frequencies). I’vehit a wall here and so if anyone can help me ﬁgure
out how to do this analysis, I’d be super appreciative.

Intelligent Design
Look who’s on the NYT Op-ed page. “But they do
not doubt that evolution occurred. And intelligent de-
sign itself says nothing about the religious concept of
a creator.” Actually, many of them do; Behe is one of
the few who sort of accepts evolutionary history. And
that’s after just reading the ﬁrst two paragraphs.

New York Times, February 7, 2005 OP-ED CONTRIB-
UTOR Design for Living By MICHAEL J. BEHE
Bethlehem, Pa. - IN the wake of the recent lawsuits over
the teaching of Darwinian evolution, there has been a
rush to debate the merits of the rival theory of intelli-
gent design. As one of the scientists who have proposed
design as an explanation for biological systems, I have
found widespread confusion about what intelligent de-
sign is and what it is not.
First, what it isn’t: the theory of intelligent design is
not a religiously based idea, even though devout peo-
ple opposed to the teaching of evolution cite it in their
arguments. For example, a critic recently caricatured
intelligent design as the belief that if evolution occurred
at all it could never be explained by Darwinian natu-
ral selection and could only have been directed at ev-
ery stage by an omniscient creator. That’s misleading.
Intelligent design proponents do question whether ran-
dom mutation and natural selection completely explain
the deep structure of life. But they do not doubt that
evolution occurred. And intelligent design itself says
nothing about the religious concept of a creator.
Rather, the contemporary argument for intelligent de-
sign is based on physical evidence and a straightforward
application of logic. The argument for it consists of four
linked claims. The ﬁrst claim is uncontroversial: we can
often recognize the eﬀects of design in nature. For ex-
ample, unintelligent physical forces like plate tectonics
and erosion seem quite suﬃcient to account for the ori-March 1, 2005 EvolDir 47
gin of the Rocky Mountains. Yet they are not enough
to explain Mount Rushmore.
Of course, we know who is responsible for Mount Rush-
more, but even someone who had never heard of the
monument could recognize it as designed. Which leads
to the second claim of the intelligent design argument:
the physical marks of design are visible in aspects of
biology. This is uncontroversial, too. The 18th-century
clergyman William Paley likened living things to a
watch, arguing that the workings of both point to intel-
ligent design. Modern Darwinists disagree with Paley
that the perceived design is real, but they do agree that
life overwhelms us with the appearance of design.
For example, Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the struc-
ture of DNA, once wrote that biologists must constantly
remind themselves that what they see was not designed
but evolved. (Imagine a scientist repeating through
clenched teeth: “It wasn’t really designed. Not really.”)
The resemblance of parts of life to engineered mecha-
nisms like a watch is enormously stronger than what
Reverend Paley imagined. In the past 50 years modern
science has shown that the cell, the very foundation of
life, is run by machines made of molecules. There are
little molecular trucks in the cell to ferry supplies, little
outboard motors to push a cell through liquid.
In 1998 an issue of the journal Cell was devoted to
molecular machines, with articles like “The Cell as a
Collection of Protein Machines” and “Mechanical De-
vices of the Spliceosome: Motors, Clocks, Springs and
Things.” Referring to his student days in the 1960’s,
Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of
Sciences, wrote that “the chemistry that makes life pos-
sible is much more elaborate and sophisticated than
anything we students had ever considered.” In fact,
Dr. Alberts remarked, the entire cell can be viewed
as a factory with an elaborate network of interlocking
assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of
large protein machines. He emphasized that the term
machine was not some fuzzy analogy; it was meant lit-
erally.
The next claim in the argument for design is that we
have no good explanation for the foundation of life that
doesn’t involve intelligence. Here is where thoughtful
people part company. Darwinists assert that their the-
ory can explain the appearance of design in life as the
result of random mutation and natural selection act-
ing over immense stretches of time. Some scientists,
however, think the Darwinists’ conﬁdence is unjusti-
ﬁed. They note that although natural selection can
explain some aspects of biology, there are no research
studies indicating that Darwinian processes can make
molecular machines of the complexity we ﬁnd in thecell.
Scientists skeptical of Darwinian claims include many
who have no truck with ideas of intelligent design, like
those who advocate an idea called complexity theory,
which envisions life self-organizing in roughly the same
way that a hurricane does, and ones who think organ-
isms in some sense can design themselves.

Intelligent Design responses

to add one of your own.

lettertoeditor.html ’Intelligent Design’
Published: February 12, 2005
To the Editor:
In “Design for Living” (Op-Ed, Feb. 7), Michael J.
Behe quoted me, recalling how I discovered that “the
chemistry that makes life possible is much more elabo-
rate and sophisticated than anything we students had
ever considered” some 40 years ago. Dr. Behe then
paraphrases my 1998 remarks that “the entire cell can
be viewed as a factory with an elaborate network of in-
terlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of
a set of large protein machines.”
That I was unaware of the complexity of living things as
a student should not be surprising. In fact, the majestic
chemistry of life should be astounding to everyone. But
these facts should not be misrepresented as support for
the idea that life’s molecular complexity is a result of
“intelligent design.” To the contrary, modern scientiﬁc
views of the molecular organization of life are entirely
consistent with spontaneous variation and natural se-
lection driving a powerful evolutionary process.
In evolution, as in all areas of science, our knowledge is
incomplete. But the entire success of the scientiﬁc en-
terprise has depended on an insistence that these gaps
be ﬁlled by natural explanations, logically derived from
conﬁrmable evidence. Because “intelligent design” the-48 EvolDir March 1, 2005

To the Editor:
Re “Design for Living,” by Michael J. Behe (Op-Ed,
Feb. 7):
The basic principle of intelligent design is that life is
just too complicated to occur by chance, and thus there
must be some intelligent entity guiding the process.
A much more likely explanation is that our inability to
comprehend these phenomena that appear “designed”
merely reﬂects our own limitations as a species. We
only recently discovered ﬁre and the wheel and remain
a basically savage society. Why not recognize our own
limited capacity to understand complexity?
Our perception of complexity derives from our sense of
scale in daily events. Is it any surprise that from this
perspective, the evolution of life is beyond our grasp
to comprehend? Intelligent design, like other creation
myths, is just another way for us to make sense of our
world.
A simpler alternative is to embrace our limited ability
to comprehend and move on from there.
Richard W. Grant, M.D. Boston, Feb. 7, 2005
-
To the Editor:
I, like most working scientists, remain extremely skep-
tical that intelligent design can yet claim to be part
of science. Writers such as the evolutionary theorist
Richard Dawkins have pointed out the philosophical
and scientiﬁc weaknesses in design arguments.
For me, the telling point is that the proponents of de-
sign cannot answer how it was supposed to have hap-
pened. Was it from divine intervention, visits by space
aliens, magic?

To the Editor:
Michael J. Behe is right that the general public is free to
accept intelligent design. This idea may be psychologi-cally or spiritually attractive and even consistent with
the world we see around us.
But the doctrine of intelligent design does not produce
falsiﬁable (or disprovable) statements that are suscep-
tible to testing. This rigorous testing process is the
central element of the modern scientiﬁc method.
Assertions about intelligent design fall into an area of
faith and belief outside the scope of science.

To the Editor:
Michael J. Behe does an important service by taking the
theory of intelligent design out of the hands of much of
the faith-based community - where, unfortunately, it is
equated with creationism - and providing its scientiﬁc
underpinnings.
It is important to add that Darwin was not an atheist
who set out to disprove that God created life. Rather,
he set out to disprove that every single living thing was
“specially created” by God and show instead that most
living things evolved from other living things.
Darwin believed that God created life and “set in mo-
tion” the “laws of the universe” - including evolution -
but did not tinker with them.
Dr. Behe says that many scientists “see roles for both
the messiness of evolution and the elegance of design.”

Isolation by distance answers
Thank you very much to everyone who replied to my
isolation-by-distance question. There was, of course a
mistake in my original posting- Slatkin proposes using
Fst/(1-Fst) where distances are linear, not 1/(1-Fst) as
I stated.
My original question was:
I wish to test for isolation-by-distance amongst popu-March 1, 2005 EvolDir 49
lations of a stream- dwelling salmonid. In many pub-
lished papers this is approached by testing for a pos-
itive correlation between Fst and distance. However,
other authors perform this test using 1/(1-Fst) instead
of Fst, following Rousset (1997). Can someone advise
me which is the correct test statistic, and why?
The answers:
1. The correct quantity is FST/(1-FST), which varies
from zero to inﬁnity (FST just varies from zero to one).
So if you are looking for a linear relationship between
genetic and geographic distance (which varies from zero
to inﬁnity) you want to use FST/(1-FST).
Rousset also makes good points about whether to
use untransformed or log transformed distances. For
salmon, you’d probably want to use untransformed dis-
tance, measured along the stream course, since streams
are essentially one dimensional.
Slatkin’s 1993 Evolution paper is also good, as are his
other papers on gene ﬂow.
2. I suggest you read :

of isolation by distance in the anadromous brook charr
(Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill). Genetics, 163: 983- 996
Castric V. et Bernatchez L. 2004. Individual assign-
ment methods reveal restricted dispersal despite no de-
tectable increase of genetic diﬀerences with distance in

fontinalis. Molecular Ecology:

sures of gene ﬂow and migration: Fst not equal to
1/(4Nm+1). Heredity, 82: 117-125
3. A few bits cut & pasted from my PhD thesis:
Rousset (1997) devised a method to use FST estimators
and geographic distances to test for a linear association
between these two quantities. Representation of data is
a plot of estimates of FST /(1- FST) against distance
in one dimensions (i.e. linear as in a river bank or the
coast of Chile) or log distance in two dimensions (i.e. a
lake).
The pairwise FST values were additionally used to
test for a linear association between genetic diﬀerenti-
ation and geographic distances between the respective
populations (isolation by distance; Rousset, 1997) us-
ing Genepop (Ver 3.1) (Raymond & Rousset, 1995).
The Mantel test (Mantel, 1967) was used to exam-
ine whether a correlation existed between the pairwise
FST values and the corresponding pairwise geographi-
cal distances. The linearised genetic diﬀerentiation and
geographic distance matrices were permutated 10,000times to generate a null distribution between the two
variables. A Spearman rank correlation coeﬃcient was
calculated and a one-tailed test of signiﬁcance was per-
formed to determine whether this coeﬃcient was statis-
tically outside the null distribution.
The equation of the linear regression produced will be
in the form y = a + bx, where a is the intercept and
b is the slope of the regression. Rousset (1997) showed
that the slope of the linear regression can be used to
estimate ’neighbourhood size’ (Nb):
<<...OLE Obj...>> Where: <<...OLE Obj...>>
Slope of regression
Nb is the eﬀective number of individuals within a circle
of radius 2´ ox (variance of the dispersal distribution). It
is a dimensionless ratio, which determines the relative
strength of gene ﬂow and drift, the continuous popula-
tion equivalent of Nm (Slatkin & Barton, 1989).
4. The Rousset correction is performed because Fst is
limited in the values it can take (it only varies between 0
and 1) which is strictly not comparable with geograph-
ical distance which can increases from zero indeﬁnitely.
The converted distance also scales between 0 and inﬁn-
ity which allows it to be more correctly compared with
geographic distance. I thinks the correction is Fst/(1-
Fst) not 1/(1-Fst) as you wrote. ALso if you have a lot
of geographic distances that vary in scale, (eg lots of
distance around 10-20 km then a jump to >200km for
example) a log conversion of geographic distance might
be more appropriate.
5. I guess the answer in Rousset’s paper. However
a ﬁrst point: there is a diﬀerence between testing for
IBD (which can be done using a Mantel-like test, im-
plemented in Genepop and other softwares; note that
you can in principle use any kind of distance for run-
ning such a test) and using Rousset’s method. What
F. Rousset has shown, based on explicit population ge-
netics theory, is a linear relationship between Fst / (1 -
Fst) and distance (or its log, depending on the number
of dimensions) under speciﬁc circumstances (e.g. on
sigma2). The strong aspect is that, if you think that
you are under these circumstances, the slope

Kangaroo cDNA
We are working on a project characterizing some novel
human genes. To study the evolution of these genes
it would be crucial to us to have some kangaroo RNA
or cDNA. Then we could test for gene expression and
sequence the kangaroo genes present. So far I have not
seen anyone oﬀering this commercially and therefore
we are trying this way to ﬁnd someone who might be
willing to help us out.
We will of course pay the transportation costs and will
acknowledge the gift in any resulting communication.

Dear all,
I’m looking for source references for a couple of life his-
tory evolution hypotheses, which I’m sure I’ve come
across before but can’t remember where. Any help
would be most appreciated:
1. Is there known or thought to be a trade-oﬀ between
evolution of increased fecundity in mothers and evolu-
tion of oﬀspring traits that increase their survival prob-
ability (such as physical defences)? If yes, is this a
smooth relationship or is there a cut-oﬀ point in terms
of survival probability, below which increased fecundity
is selected for and above which increased survival is se-
lected for?
2. Is intraspeciﬁc resource competition known or
thought to cause temporal intraspeciﬁc polymorphisms
in resource use, possibly between life stages within a
generation but more importantly (for me) between gen-
erations?

MatrixMill extractions
Hi
We are thinking of buying a Matrix Mill (as manu-

Lansing, NY, USA) to use for DNA extraction of plant
material in 96well plates and I wondered if anyone had
experience using the equipment and could advise us.
It seems from their blurb that they recommend their
equipment for extracting DNA that is going to be used
immediately for pcr but not for extracting DNA that
may need to be stored for analysis later on. We want
to do both and wondered if anyone had used this andstored the DNA for any length of time or alternately
had used this equipment for grinding but then used
a modiﬁed CTAB extraction or other DNA extraction
method subsequently.
Advice please! Thank you in advance.

NestedCladeAnalysis
Dear All, I want to apply nested clade analysis to
mtDNA sequence data, and am looking for suggestions
of how to get multiple disconnected parsimony networks
to connect into a single network (actually, two discon-
nected networks would be okay, but beyond that, the
correct higher-level clade nesting order becomes uncer-
tain). Below are a few details about my particular case,
a list of the approaches I have tried, and the outcomes:
570-bp mtDNA COI fragment, 69 haplotypes from 200
animals (springtails) - up to 12% uncorrected p se-
quence divergence. Collected from 70 localities (ﬁne-
scale sampling at approx. 2-3 km intervals) spanning
the species’ entire known geographic range. End up
with two parsimony networks that contain the majority
of haplotypes (40 and 10 haplotypes, respectively), one
very small network (5 haplotypes), and the remainder
are either groups of two haplotypes or single unlinked
haplotypes. Gives a total of 9 disconnected networks.
- Tried converting 3rd positions to transversions only,
then used 1+2+3tv to build the parsimony network.
- Tried removing 3rd positions altogether, then used
1+2 to build the parsimony network.
- Tried cutting the full length sequence (arbitrarily) in
half, then used each of the two 285-bp fragments sepa-
rately.
- Tried reducing the 95% conﬁdence setting in TCS
down to 90%.
- Tried the approach suggested by Templeton & Sing
(1993) i.e. build a Maximum Parsimony tree in PAUP
(but constrain haplotypes within each of the networks
that do connect at 95% conﬁdence, so you’re just re-
solving inter-network relationships), reconstruct DNA
sequences of nodes that represent shared mutational52 EvolDir March 1, 2005
pathways among two or more of the disconnected net-
works, then re-run TCS with these inferred ancestral
nodal haplotypes included.
The end result has been one (or two) of the following:
- Formerly disconnected networks still fail to form one
or two networks... the number of networks I end up
with is roughly proportional to the amount of informa-
tion that is being discarded by the particular method
used.
- Homoplasy (reﬂected by reticulation or closed loops
within networks) becomes quite prevalent.
- The incorporation of reconstructed nodal haplotype
sequences does not create any new linkages among the
disconnected networks, at 95% conﬁdence.
Any ideas would be most appreciated.

NestedCladeAnalysis answers
Dear Evoldir members,
Below are the responses I received to my recent ques-
tion regarding how best to deal with disconnected par-
simony networks when performing NCA with relatively
highly divergent intraspeciﬁc mtDNA sequence data
(up to 12% uncorrected p). Thanks to everyone who
oﬀered advice... your comments were very helpful &
informative.
cheers,
Ryan
1. Your data seems quite divergent. I am not sure what
is your problem with the constrained MP approach, or
with the reduced conﬁdence setting approach but at
worst you could claim that you have nine clades at the
last nesting level.
David Posada
2.
This is a common “problem” with accompanying mis-
conceptions. I would ﬁrst ask if the diﬀerent networks
represent groups of allopatric haplotypes? If so, anyfurther eﬀorts to join them would seem rather pointless
to me. Moreover, it should be understood that the net-
work NCA approach is really only meant for closely re-
lated lineages, and the inference key for “almost” exclu-
sively intraspeciﬁc interactions. Of course, every gene
has a diﬀerent mutation rate, and we rarely have a good
idea what it is, so each network constructed with a dif-
ferent gene reﬂects a diﬀerent level of temporal resolu-
tion, a point which I think most people understand, but
few comment on, or take into consideration when draw-
ing inferences, or comparing data sets. If your data set
is really about one species, with some level of interac-
tion among many of the populations in the recent past
(e.g. the last few 100,000 years or so), then it would
seem that the COI in this species is mutating too fast
to provide the best data set for NCA across the species
range. By trying to remove 3rd positions, etc., you are
reducing the genetic resolution (in a temporal sense)
and that should help, but if it does not, and/or results
in more and more reticulate branches than it would
seem to me that you simply have too much homoplasy.
If these diﬀerent networks represent allopatric popula-
tions that have been isolated for long periods of time,
then there seems little point in wanting to “connect”
them, to support inferences other than “fragmenta-
tion”, which can be simply concluded, in any case (and
perhaps the notion that you have diﬀerent species).
I see no problem in conducting the analysis on your
larger networks independently (the ones with 40 and
10), and simply inferring long-term fragmentation for
the other smaller networks, which I presume are located
on peripheral edges of the distribution and/or in spe-
ciﬁc refugia or areas that have undergone bottlenecks
accompanied with isolation.
Lastly, if these diﬀerent networks do not represent al-
lopatric groups of haplotypes, it is more complicated,
and you need to ﬁrst establish through other genetic
marker systems if you are indeed looking at one or more
species before considering other approaches to the prob-
lem

In the new version of TCS (1.18), you can ﬁx the con-
nection limit to a deﬁned number of steps, instead of
using the 95 or 90% connection limit. So you can just
increase this number of steps, until all your haplotypes
are connected in a single network.
Best wishes, Patrick

I think you might need to just set TCS’s connectionMarch 1, 2005 EvolDir 53
limit (not a conﬁdence limit) down much lower. My un-
derstanding of that is that if you have 12% diﬀerence,
then to get them into one clade, you need to go down to
below that, e.g. below 88% connection limit. You might
need to go lower, though. From what you’re saying, I’m
not entirely certain (my ignorance here) whether 12% is
the maximum distance between two animals. It’s that
max you should use. Also be sure that the sequences
are all aligned exactly.
Good luck! Ruth
5.
Could you constrain the groups found in Paup and get
that to recover the best phylogeny of the disconnected
groups? If I was forced to analyse the data that way I
would do it. However, realize that you have some deep
diversity issues which probably violate assumptions of
the NCA and/or some other process like cryptic speci-
ation might be in play.
Joe
6. I have never encountered your problem.....my major
problem with networks have always been intragenomic
variation and homoplasy. I attach you a paper that
might be useful. But in your case I think I would ap-
proach it this way:
I would construct the network in the classic way, i.e.
95% conﬁdence. Because you don’t want to lose power.
If the result is whatever number of disconnected net-
works, I think you have to deal with this by discussing
it in your paper: what could explain this pattern? You
should deﬁnitely calculate what is/are the nearest con-
nection/s (less mutation steps) between your discon-
nected networks and haplotypes, and then join them
together in the shortest way in order to get the whole
picture. You will probably get loops that you also will
have to deal with them....but that might be easy as
there are some rules to resolve

But the program could not calculate the Ks for some

Relation s migration
I have two questions concerning the relationship be-
tween the selective advantage of an allele (s) and the
rate at which it migrates over geographic distance.
For those of you interested in the background: we can
model, or measure, the selective advantage associated
with alleles conferring drug resistance in malaria, so
have estimates of ’s’, but the alleles appear to occur
very rarely and have subsequently migrated around the
world.
Intuitively, there must be a positive relationship
but has it been quantiﬁed? On the basis that
Fisher/Haldane/Wright sewed up most of population54 EvolDir March 1, 2005
genetics in the 1920s to 1940s I tried there and was not
disappointed:
Fisher, R. A. (1937). The wave of advance of advanta-
geous genes. Ann.Eugen 7: 355-369.
who found that rate of advance was proportional to the
square root of ’s’. This paper appears to be cited only
rarely (at least in this context; it is used a lot in chem-
istry as a basis for the diﬀusion of reactions) so my ﬁrst
question is whether it was ﬂawed, overlooked, or was
simply superseded by later work?
My second question pertains to island and stepping
stone models: has anyone investigated the relation-
ship between ’s’ and migration rate from these mod-
els? Apologies if they have, but I haven’t located it
among all the work looking at more complex questions
like maintenance of clines, genetic variability etc.
I realise I could probably do it myself using stepping
models but there is the (non-negligible) risk I would get
it wrong, it is superﬂuous if it has been done already,
but most importantly I just need to cite the result in
a review and don’t want to have to prove it in an ap-
pendix.
As a technical point, malaria is haploid so we need not
worry about dominance.
Thanks to those who can comment.

This information is probably of no help, but in case it
is... I did similar work for my PhD research. Here is
one method that did not work, just in case you were
thinking of it. I thought if I digested the PCR prod-
uct with a restriction enzyme that only cut one allele, I
could cut out the undigested band from an agarose gelMarch 1, 2005 EvolDir 55
and sequence it to get the haplotype phase. But it was
always still heterozygous. I think it was because in the
later stages of PCR you produce a lot of heteroduplex
dsDNA as the two haplotypes denature and reanneal.
The enzyme won’t cut the heteroduplex DNA, and it
runs with the larger (undigested) band. It should work
if you cut out one of the smaller bands and sequence
it, so that may be worth a try. Restriction enzymes
are cheap and the methodology is simple. I never tried
DGGE because it seemed like too much work to set up
the gel pouring. The ﬁrst time I tried SSCP I nearly
burned down the lab. I did have success with allele-
speciﬁc PCR for haplotyping, and with TA-cloning of
PCR products, although with the latter I did see some
in vitro PCR-recombination, or jumping PCR, or what-
ever they call it these days.
Good luck, Mike
Just to chuck another idea into your pot RSCA (refer-
ence strand conformation analysis) is based on a similar
idea to SSCP but you bind your sample on to a known
sequence reference strand, and run this without dena-
turing it. The main advantages should be that be using
diﬀerent reference strands you should get diﬀerent pa-
terns of separation in your products. Therefore you
can be sure that each of you products has only one se-
quence (and aren’t mixed products that are migrating
together). There are a couple of references that you

I guess you do not want to clone, because it is kinda
expensive and time consuming. I’ve never used other
techniques than cloning, and it worked really well for
me, especially because you get to know the speciﬁc al-
leles of your polymorphisms. Anyway, I attach you a
pdf article of a study where we had to deal with multi-
copy nuclear region (ITS) and where cloning helped a
lot (Molecular Ecology 2004, 13, 109-122)
Good luck and all the best, Sandra
I have been using SSCP to score nuclear genotypes, and
also as an alternative to cloning alleles for sequencing.
We use isotope incorporation (alpha 33P dATP), and
visualise by autoradiography. If you staple your ﬁlm to
the gel, you can then excise single-stranded DNA and
use it as template for reampliﬁcation / sequencing (see

Time commitment: If you have (i) a large number of
individuals to screen (say >250), and/or (ii) a large
number of alleles at a locus (say >10), this can require
a fairly big time commitment. After your initial run, it
is usually essential to reshuﬄe samples within that gel

SYBR Green I
Dear Evoldir members:
I am interesting in rapid screening of microsatellite
markers for polymorphism using SYBR Green I and a
gel (ALF Express) or capillary (ABI 3100) automated
DNA sequencer. I am wondering whether people have
some experiences and the protocol employed.

Software BEAST v1 2
A new version of BEAST (v1.2) is now available from
the BEAST website:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/ This version fea-
tures some new demographic models:
* The Bayesian Skyline demographic model is now
available in BEAUti & BEAST. The Bayesian skyline
plot is a new method for estimating past population
dynamics through time from a sample of molecular se-
quences without dependence on a pre-speciﬁed para-
metric model of demographic history.
This model is described in the following paper:
http://mbe.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/-
msi103v1 * We have also added the Logistic
demographic model which can be selected within
BEAUti.
In order to analyse either of these models in Tracer, you
will require the latest Tracer package (v1.2.1):
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software/tracer/ For more
information see the following site:

tutorials, documentation and FAQ. There is also a sec-
tion of the website where users can contribute informa-
tion, ask questions and the like.

Software DataMonkey Update
Dear EvolDir,
We are pleased to announce an update to DataMonkey
(http://www.datamonkey.org; [1]), a web-based inter-
face to HyPhy ( http://www.hyphy.org; [2]), a sophis-
ticated software package for phylogenetic modeling of
sequence variation.
DataMonkey estimates nonsynonymous and synony-
mous substitution rates, dN and dS, in coding se-
quences alignments on a codon-by-codon basis, in order
to detect sites under positive or negative selection [3].Three methods are oﬀered; the ﬁrst is a counting based
method (up to 150 sequences), similar to that of Suzuki
and Gojobori (1999, [4]), but which uses maximum like-
lihood ancestral reconstruction; the second is a ﬁxed
eﬀects type model (up to 50 sequences), in which dN
and dS are estimated on a site-by-site basis using max-
imum likelihood, similar to that of Suzuki (2004, [5])
and Massingham and Goldman (2005, [6]), except that
variation in dS across sites is permitted; and the third
is a random eﬀects type model (up to 25 sequences), in
which a distribution of rates across sites is performed,
with empirical Bayes estimation of sites under selection,
similar to the models of Nielsen and Yang (1998, [7])
and Yang et al. (2000, [8]), except that these models
also place a distribution on dS as well as a distribu-
tion on dN. All methods can use one of 203 underlying
reversible nucleotide models, to accommodate complex
patterns of nucleotide substitution bias. The method-
ology is now published in advance access in Molecular
Biology and Evolution ( http://mbe.oupjournals.org/-
cgi/content/abstract/msi105v1 ).
Results output includes estimates of dN and dS on a
codon-by-codon basis, generation of plots in PDF or
PNG format, and for the counting method, site-by-
site inferred substitutions, which can be graphically
mapped onto a phylogeny. These methods take advan-
tage of our Linux cluster, and so will run signiﬁcantly
faster than using a stand-alone version of HyPhy on a
desktop computer. Our server reports cluster load, and
the progress of each submission in a queue.
Please visit http://www.datamonkey.org for further de-
tails of these methods. These analyses, and many
more, can be implemented within HyPhy, the current
build of which can be found at http://www.hyphy.org/-
current/index.php . Suggestions on how we can im-
prove and expand both Datamonkey and HyPhy can be
posted on our message board, http://www.hyphy.org/-
cgi-bin/yabb/yabb.pl . Bugs can be posted separately

Software PAPA v2
Dear evoldir members, we wish to announce the
latest version of the parental allocation pro-
gram PAPA (2.0) available free of charge at:
<http://www.bio.ulaval.ca/louisbernatchez/ﬁles/-
PAPA 2.0USER.zip >http://www.bio.ulaval.ca/-
louisbernatchez/ﬁles/PAPA 2.0USER.zip PAPA is
designed for parental allocation in closed systems i.e.
when all parental genotypes have been collected. If
you suspect some parents are missing, use PASOS 1.0
instead (see separate evoldir message). This version
adds several new features to the preceding ones (1.0,
1.1). It is now possible to simulate crossing/matching
plans with resulting oﬀspring mixed together. This
should prove especially useful in aquaculture contexts
and also in natural settings when some putative repro-
ducers are known a priori not to have mated together.
Error modelling is now done simply by typing in the
transmission probabilities instead of ﬁxing values for
intermediate parameters as previously. We also added
to the simulation output ﬁles a Summary ﬁle, which for
most uses is self-contained and shows the main resultsin a clear and convivial way. PAPA 2.0 now accepts
genotypes of as many as 50 loci (21 previously). A
User Guide is provided which describes possible user
scenarios for PAPA 2.0, a large set of questions and
answers inspired by past interactions with users, and
an Appendix containing deﬁnitions of all technical
expressions found in the User Guide as well as in the
PAPA 2.0 interface. We believe that PAPA 2.0 is now
a more complete, easier to use and better documented
program.

Software PASOS v1
Dear evoldir members,
we wish to introduce the ﬁrst version of the parental
allocation program PASOS (1.0). PASOS is a program
written in C++ and designed to assess parentage from
collected parents and progeny based on individual
multi-locus genotypes while detecting the proportion
of missing parents when some have not been collected
from the population. It was speciﬁcally designed for
parental allocation in open systems i.e. when some
parental genotypes are missing. If you are convinced
that all parental genotypes have been collected, use
PAPA 2.0 instead (see separate evoldir message).
Another purpose of PASOS is to calculate and output
reliable estimates of the probability that allocations
are correct. This second goal is achieved through simu-
lations. A third goal of the PASOS program is to allow
the use of subsets of the available loci in order to ﬁnd
those of minimal number of loci which provide enough
power to reach the desired rates of allocation and58 EvolDir March 1, 2005
correctness. This is also achieved by means of the sim-
ulator. Finally, PASOS provides suﬃcient information
to estimate the rates of scoring errors of various sizes.
The PASOS interface is very similar to the one found
in PAPA, its closed system counterpart (Duchesne et
al. 2002). PASOS can be downloaded free of charge

Does anybody know of a software programme which
will allow you to estimate the number of microsatellite
loci that are required to identify all individuals within

SystBiol2006 CallForSymposia
Call for 2006 Symposia. The Society for Systematic
Biologists invites proposals for symposia at the 2006
SSB meeting to be held at the State University of New
York, Stonybrook. The meeting will be held jointly
with the American Society of Naturalists and the So-
ciety for the Study of Evolution. Proposals should in-
clude (1) a descriptive title, (2) one or two paragraphs
explaining the purpose of the symposium and its rel-
evance to systematics, (3) a list of presentations in-
cluding proposed speakers, their institutions or aﬃli-
ations, and their presentation titles, (4) an indication
of whether the speakers have been invited and whether
they have agreed to participate, and (5) the proposed
length of each talk. Symposia are restricted to half-day
sessions. The society is particularly interested in sym-
posia whose topics do not overlap with those from pre-
vious meetings, that introduce new ideas or synthesize
important concepts, or those that are particularly good
examples of the analysis of empirical data. ProposalsMarch 1, 2005 EvolDir 59
that unite systematics with other ﬁelds are also desir-
able. We encourage participation from young investi-
gators and others typically under-represented in sym-
posia. Limited funding is available. The target date for
receipt of proposals is May 15, 2005. Proposals will be
discussed and two will be selected at the SSB Council
meeting during the 2005 annual meeting in Fairbanks,
Alaska. Soon after, organizers will be notiﬁed of the
status of their proposals. Proposals should be sent by
email to the Program Chairperson, George D. Weiblen,

Trifolium samples
Dear evoldir-members
we are currently working on the molecular evolution
of ﬂowering genes in the genus Trifolium. The idea
is to try to couple phenotypic variation between and
within species to variation (either molecular sequence
variation and/or gene expression variation). Right now
we are sequencing ﬂowering genes in a lot of Trifolium
species, some of which are allopolyploids (e.g. Trifolium
repens). To check for the origin of within individual
variation in sequences in these allopolyploids, we would
like to obtain material from the alleged parent species.
Therefore we need material from the following species:
Trifolium nigrescens Trifolium uniﬂorum Trifolium oc-
cidentale
These species should be present in Southern Europe
and nigrescens also in southeastern USA.
If anyone could help us obtain samples of these species,
we would be most greatful! Please contact me on details
of how to sample and store material.
Thank you very much In advance!!!!!!

UPretoria PopSizeFluctuations
Hello all, I have searched for this using various engines,
so I am now posing this question to evoldir. I am look-
ing for some information regarding the eﬀects of annual
population size ﬂuctuations on population genetic data,
speciﬁcally microsats. I work with a species that is both
continous and eruptive, with annual population size dif-
ferences of several orders of magnitude. Speciﬁcally I
am interested in the inference of migratory estimates
for continous populations, such as neighbourhood size,
from such data. My best logical interpretation is that
population size ﬂuctuations will tend to homogenise ge-
netic variability across localities as a result of increased
numbers of homozygotes. However, this homogenising
eﬀect would be explicitly dependent on the dispersal
ability of the species, and could under low dispersal
rates cause divergence as a result of genetic drift. Has
anyone done, or does anyone know of, work that is a
simulation model of this process. I’d appreciate any
comments or suggestions. thanks ./w

Cologne EvolGeneRegulation
Postdoc: Evolution of gene regulation in Cologne, Ger-
many
A postdoc position is open at the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany;
starting in October 2005 to join a newly funded group
in the department of Genetics and Plant Breeding (dir.
Prof. Maarten Koornneef). The position is for two
years with possible extension of an additional year.
Applicants with a strong background in evolutionary
biology (either applied or theoretical) and with inter-
est in functional and molecular studies of diversity are
invited to apply. Application from skilled molecular
biologists with a strong interest in evolution will also
be carefully considered. A background in plant biology
and/or gene regulation are not a prerequisite.
Our group is interested in evaluating the role played
by cis-regulatory regions in adaptative evolution. For
this, we are undertaking an analysis of nucleotide and
functional evolutionary dynamics of promoter regions
within and among closely related species of the Ara-
bidopsis genus. Our ultimate goal is to relate this diver-
sity to its ecological role in natural environments. Cis-
regulatory evolution remains largely unexplored and
there is plenty of room for investigating novel evolu-
tionary concepts and ideas. Thus, speciﬁc interests of
the successful applicant can easily be integrated into
our research questions and approaches.
The Max Planck Institute oﬀers an outstanding envi-
ronment for carrying out ambitious and innovative re-
search. The Department of Genetics and Plant Breed-
ing brings together plant molecular biologists, quanti-
tative geneticists and evolutionary biologists to investi-
gate the causes and consequences of plant natural vari-
ation. The Institute beneﬁts from a superb interdisci-
plinary scientiﬁc community, with world class molecular
biology being performed and active contacts with out-
standing evolutionary geneticists located in the nearby
University of Cologne.
Cologne, the metropolis on the Rhine, has just over
one million inhabitants and is the fourth-largest city in
Germany. It oﬀers plenty of cultural and recreation-
nal activities. The city further beneﬁts from its cen-tral location in the european travel network. Train go
directly from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt Interna-
tional Airport. Low cost air companies operate at the
local airport (K¨ oln-Bonn) and can take you anywhere
in Europe in a couple of hours.
Applicants are encouraged to consult the In-
stitute/Departmental websites at http://-
www.ice.mpg.de/tmo/research/RegEvol.htm or
http://www.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de . Review of ap-
plications will begin on March 15th 2005 and continue
until the position is ﬁlled. Please provide a cover
letter, curriculum vitae and contact information
for two referees and submit to: Juliette de Meaux

Marie Curie Research training network (MRTN) SEX-
ASEX - postdoctoral position available in molecular ge-
netics
Researchers interested in the paradox of sex in evolu-
tionary biology are strongly encouraged to apply for a
research position in the European Union Marie Curie
Research Training Network SEXASEX, which is co-
ordinated by Prof. Dr. Koen Martens, RBINSc, Brus-
sels. One postdoctoral position remains to be ﬁlled,
out of a total of 10 positions. Criteria of eligibility
include: EU citizenship, less than 10 years for Experi-
enced Researchers (ER), and a willingness to work in a
European country other than the country of origin. We
seek candidates who are enthusiastic about evolution-March 1, 2005 EvolDir 63
ary biology, travelling and living abroad, learning in a
multidisciplinary research environment and working in
teams. This appointment will be for 3 years.
The application of female candidates is especially en-
couraged; detailed information on child care facilities
at the diﬀerent institutions will be provided upon re-
quest. Aid can be sought if accompanying spouses also
require employment abroad.
Project overview: Sex is the queen of evolutionary
problems. It will be tackled by SEXASEX in a mul-
tidisciplinary approach, providing training and trans-
fer of knowledge for a total of 360 person-months. 10
network researchers (6 young researchers (YR) and 4
experienced researchers (ER)) will receive training in
9 institutions across as many countries. A wide ar-
ray of research tools will provide excellent training op-
portunities, for example through individual career de-
velopment plans, individual tutoring and secondments,
which will be supplemented by participation in courses
and external workshops. Network-wide training will ex-
ploit the extensive experience of the partner institutions
through ﬁve courses and summer schools for all network
researchers. Complementary skills such as management
and communication (verbal, written) will be developed,
and gender awareness will be raised, in two network-
wide meetings. The network’s theoretical and empir-
ical research will apply 13 major approaches, includ-
ing novel genetic and cytogenetic approaches, intraspe-
ciﬁc phylogeography, ecology, behavioural studies, GIS
analyses and theoretical modelling. With this mul-
tidisciplinary toolkit, SEXASEX will investigate why
sex exists at all, given its evolutionary costs, using the
model organism Eucypris virens, a non-marine ostra-
cod species with both sexual and asexual reproduction.
What determines its gender, what are the genomic con-
sequences of long-term asexuality, what is the cohesive-
ness of a species with mixed reproduction, how do asex-
uals and sexuals compete and what is their historical
zoogeography? The pluralistic approach of SEXASEX
is unique and timely, using highly novel methodologies
and dealing with cutting edge science based on Euro-
pean excellence and tradition. Please refer to http://-

mination mechanisms in freshwater ostracods in general
and in E. virens in particular remain elusive: are they
chromosome based (XY or XO systems), environmen-
tally cued or are other factors at play? What genetic
changes underlie the transition to asexual reproduction
and what changes accumulate as a result of long term
asexuality? We will investigate these questions with a
range of modern genetic and cytogenetic approaches.
Correlations between chromosomal architecture and/or
other cytological factors and reproductive mode will be
examined, using ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization tech-
niques. Gene expression will be examined with Sup-
pression Subtractive Hybridisation (SSH). This will be
used to search for genes that are expressed diﬀerently
in sexual females and asexual females (from young or
old lineages) to identify genes involved in the transition
to asexual reproduction and the

A three-year BBSRC funded postdoctoral position in
human population genetics is available in the lab of Fra-
nois Balloux ( http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/newdept/-
research/labs/balloux.htm ).
The aim of the project is to use neutral genetic mark-
ers to reconstruct past human settlement history, with
particular emphasis on the genetic legacy of early Ne-
olithic farmers. A possible development of the project
would be to use the resulting demographic models for
disentangling between the relative eﬀect of past demog-
raphy and natural selection on the current geographic
distribution of speciﬁc genes (e.g. disease or nutrition
genes).
The project is generously funded and the lab well
equipped. An exciting aspect of the project is the avail-
ability of an exceptional dataset of 2,500 blood samples66 EvolDir March 1, 2005
from the eastern part of the Fertile Crescent (mostly
Iran).
The ideal candidate would have strong interest in past
human settlement history and human genomics as well
as demonstrated competencies in quantitative aspects
of population genetics and is expected to focus on the
more advanced aspects of data analysis. The selected
candidate will be working in close collaboration with a
technician and a PhD student.

Position Title: Postdoc, Molecular Evolutionary Ge-
netics
Position Location: U Paris 11 (Orsay) France
Position Description: A two years CNRS post doc po-
sition is available in the lab Ecologie, Systematique et
Evolution in the University of Paris 11 (Orsay). The
targeted starting date is September 1, 2005, but is ﬂex-
ible. Our lab works on a broad range of projects in
evolutionary biology, e.g. host-parasite co-evolution,
biological invasions, reproductive systems, genome evo-lution, using experiments as well as mathematical mod-
elling.
The project aims at detecting and studying the evolu-
tion of genes involved in the specialization and the spe-
ciation of a model parasite, Microbotryum violaceum.
This fungus causes a sexually transmitted disease, and
constitutes a complex of sibling species, specialized on
diﬀerent Cayophyllaceae. This project aims at detect-
ing genes that have rapidly evolved, and diﬀerently be-
tween close species, assuming that these genes will have
important functions in speciation, specialisation, host-
parasite co-evolution. EST libraries are under construc-
tion for 5 sibling species of Microbotryum. Signatures
of positive or diversifying selection will be investigated
by comparing orthologs among these genomes, e.g. us-
ing the ratio of synonymous vs non synonymous mu-
tations. These genes will then systematically be se-
quenced in the whole species complex, and their ge-
nealogies will be compared to those of conserved genes.
The variability of these genes will also be analysed
within populations and compared to neutral markers
(microsatellites, SNP, ..).
For this position, a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, host-
parasite ecology, or related ﬁeld is required. Preference
will be given to candidates with a background in popu-
lation genetic theory, statistical genetics, evolutionary
bioinformatics, and have experience in molecular biol-
ogy, including standard DNA techniques (PCR and se-
quencing). Ideally, the candidate will be involved in
various on-going projects in the lab, but also, he or she
would be encouraged to design and be responsible for
independent research that involves the collection, anal-
ysis and publishing of data. Knowledge of the French
language is not required.

Ireland Shorebirds Oct6-10
A workshop in Ireland at the Annual Conference of the
International Wader Study Group, 6-10 October 2005
Title: “Why do wader populations decline globally?
Merging population ecology theory with ﬁeld data”
A call for contributions
We will be organizing a workshop in Ireland next fall
inteded to bring together theoretical ecologists and evo-
lutionary biologists with ﬁeld workers, in order to cre-
ate a stimulating working group aimed at explaining the
ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic basis for the
observed worlwide decline of shorebirds. Read the call
for contributions below, and visit the webpage of the
congress ( http://wsg.ucc.ie/ ) for further information.
Organizers: Pablo Almaraz (e-mail: pal-
maraz@gmail.com; webpage: http://www.almaraz.org )
Tamas Szekely (e-mail: t.szekely@bath.ac.uk; webpage:http://www.bath.ac.uk/bio-sci//tamas.html )
Almost half of the known wader populations are de-
clining globally. At the 2003 WSG Congress it became
clear that this global decline occurs in many species
with diﬀerent geographic distribution, ecology and life-
style. However, the ecological and evolutionary fac-
tors that inﬂuence population declines, and popula-
tion trends in general, remain largely unknown. We
urgently need studies to reveal the intrinsic biological
traits and extrinsic human-induced threats driving pop-
ulation trends in waders.
To address these top priority issues we are organising
a Workshop at the 2005 WSG Conference in Cork. We
will invite a handful of wader-researchers, and have left
a number of slots open for contributions. We are aiming
at creating a stimulating and multidisciplinary atmo-
sphere by bringing together ﬁeldworkers, theoreticians
and policy makers.
The Workshop has four major objectives:
1) to reveal how theoretical ecology and population dy-
namics may help us to understand, predict and possibly
reverse the declining trend of wader species and popu-
lations;
2) to identify the key population variables we need to
measure in the ﬁeld;
3) to encourage researchers to investigate population
ecology of waders worldwide, and mobilise long-term
datasets on wader populations for theoretical research;
4) to emphasize the value of population viability anal-
yses (PVAs) implementing both environmental and de-
mographic variation for an eﬀective conservation strat-
egy.
We welcome contributions, both talks and posters,
from researchers, conservationists and policy-makers
on a topic related to population dynamics and PVA
of waders. We specially encourage contributions on
long-term time-series of population counts and/or de-
mographic rates of waders throughout the world.
Please send an abstract of your proposed con-
tribution to the organisers: Pablo Almaraz
(palmaraz@gmail.com) and Tamas Szekely
(t.szekely@bath.ac.uk). The abstract should in-
clude the title of contribution, authors, contact
addresses, and description of work (max 250 words).
Deadline of abstract submission: 1 May 2005. Please
note that we only have a limited number of slots, so it
may not be possible to accommodate all oﬀers. Also
note that we welcome comments and suggestions for
improving the workshop and its scope.

http://www.antweb.org DEADLINE FOR APPLICA-
TION: April 1, 2005
Southwestern Research Station (SWRS), Portal, AZ,
August 4-14, 2005
COURSE OBJECTIVES. ANT COURSE is designed
for systematists, ecologists, behaviorists, conservation
biologists, and other biologists whose research respon-
sibilities require a greater understanding of ant taxon-
omy. Emphasis is on the classiﬁcation and identiﬁca-
tion of more than ﬁfty ant genera of North America.
Lectures will include background information on the
ecology, life histories and evolution of ants. Field trips
are structured to teach collecting and sampling tech-
niques, and associated lab work provides instruction
on specimen preparation, sorting and labeling. Infor-
mation on equipment/supply vendors, literature, and
myrmecological contacts are also presented.
COURSE SIGNIFICANCE. Ant Course is a unique
opportunity to acquire training that is unavailable else-
where. This course will provide students with 1) the
conﬁdence and skills to identify the major ant genera
of North America; 2) an understanding of modern spec-
imen processing and curation techniques; 3) an appre-
ciation for the biological diversity of ants, and 4) expe-
rience keying to the species level.
SPONSORS. California Academy of Sciences and Har-
vard University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology,
with partial funding from The E.O. Wilson Foundation.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION. ANT COURSE
will be taught from August 4 14, 2005 at the South-
western Research Station (SWRS) in Portal Arizona
(http://research.amnh.org/swrs/ ). The station is cen-
tered amid the richest ant fauna in North America.
This is an ongoing course, oﬀered annually.
PARTICIPANT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. ANT
COURSE is open to all interested individuals. Priority
will be given to those biologists for whom the course willhave a signiﬁcant impact on their research with ants.
An entomological background is not required. We aim
to include students with a diverse interest in biology,
including ant systematics, ecology, behavioral biology
and conservation. The high instructor to student ra-
tio will allow students to receive individual attention.
ANT COURSE is presented in English and limited to
25 participants
COSTS. Tuition for the 10-day COURSE is $475 for
current students and $675 for non-students. In addi-
tion, Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) fees for
this period, covering dormitory room and board, are
estimated at $440. Transportation costs between home
and Tucson (air) or SWRS (auto) are to be borne by
all participants.
FELLOWSHIPS. Four fellowships are available for
2005. Two fellowships cover tuition fees and two fel-
lowships cover station fees. Foreign students may apply
for additional fellowships to assist in travel. Those in-
terested in attending the course should seek all possible
avenues to secure funding for the course. You should
only apply for the Ant Course fellowship if you can not
ﬁnd other support and it is essential for your participa-
tion in the course. Beware that if you apply for an ant
course fellowship and you are not selected for a fellow-
ship, you might not be accepted into the course. Please
notify the course if your funding request changes before
the application due date.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
