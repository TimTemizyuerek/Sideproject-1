ArchaeologyOfHumanImpact Sep2-7
Dear colleagues,
This email to raise your attention about the ses-
sion we are organizing during the next International
Congress of Zooarchaeology in Ankara ( http://-
www.icaz2018ankara.com), concerning \*The archae-
ology of human impact on faunas"*. The aim of this
session is to bring together researchers exploring the
question of the environmental impact of past societies
thought the studies of faunas. We are welcoming people
working on every taxa and geographic areas, and using
all kind of methodologies.
*Abstract:** Archaeological sciences and especially
zooarchaeology have demonstrated their relevance to
address the impact of humans on past aquatic and ter-
restrial faunas. This impact leads to the modication of
faunal communities which is driven by a wide diversity of
phenomena like introduction or extinction/extirpationof species, and erosion of the genetic or morphological
diversity of taxa. The archaeological record is crucial
to understand the slow mechanisms leading to the alter-
ation of faunas as well as the environmental impact of
past human populations in the light of the archaeologi-
cal record. This kind of research is of special interest in
the context of the current sixth mass extinction crisis,
and is a good opportunity to generate exchange between
zooarchaeology and other scientic elds like ecology
and evolution sciences. *
*This session seeks to discuss methodological questions
and to present study case concerning every aspect of
human impact on past wild fauna.*
*Communicants working on all taxa and regions of in-
terest for these questions are welcome in order to gen-
erate fruitful discussions about global trends observed
in the archaeological record as well as current and fu-
ture evolution of this eld of research. Transdisciplinary
approaches are especially welcome. Studies of modern
faunas that can be used as model for the study of past
assemblages are also relevant.*
The meeting will take place between the *2nd to the
7th of September*. The deadline for abstract submis-
sion is the *30th of March*. Do not hesitate to get inMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 3

ELVONAL is a new funding stream by the Hungarian
government to support top science across all disciplines,
and our team was one of the 12 winners (see Nature 2017,
551: 425). This will be a 5 year project that will test
key hypotheses of breeding system evolution using ge-
nomic, immunologic and demographic approaches using
shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers and allies) that exhibit
an unusual diversity of mating systems and parental
care as a model.
The topic of the 1st ELVONAL conference is SOCIAL
EVOLUTION and we have the following keynote speak-
ers:
Dr Veronika Bokony, Hungarian Academy of Sciences:
sex determination and sex ratios Professor John Mc-
Namara, University of Bristol: social behaviour and
life-history evolution Prof Eors Szathmary, Hungarian
Academy of Sciences: social evolution and major transi-
tions Dr Ferenc Jordan, Hungarian Academy of Sciences:
social networks and social interactions Dr Araxi Urrutia,
University of Bath: genomic basis of evolution of social
behaviour
The provisional programme is as follows: Thursday 19
April 2018: Arrival, Welcome receptionMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 5
Friday 20 April 2018: Full day scientic programme:
presentations by senior speakers, and contributions by
students and young academics
Saturday 21 April: Full day scientic programme: pre-
sentations by senior speakers, and contributions by stu-
dents and young academics
Sunday 22 April: Bird watching and/or departure
The conference will provide opportunities to discuss

Adaptation Jun1-3
The rst annual symposium on the Evolutionary Ge-
nomics of Adaptation will be held on June 1-3, 2018 at
Flathead Lake Biological Station near Polson Montana.
This symposium is linked to a new NSF-funded research
and training network (www.unveilnetwork.org). The
aim of this network is to both advance the science of
genome-to-phenome connections in natural populations,
and use these insights to inform eective conservation
and resource management strategies and the use of
emerging biotechnologies in conservation biology. As a
result, both the network and the symposium are interdis-
ciplinary, involving evolutionary geneticists, ecologists,
conservation biologists, and resource managers, as well
as ethicists and social scientists.
This year' ^As symposium will feature talks by keynote
speakers, Sally Aitkin (University of British Columbia),
Benjamin Blackman (UC Berkeley), Nancy Chen (Uni-
versity of Rochester), and Mike Shapiro (University of
Utah), as well as talks by symposium organizers and
other invited talks selected from submitted abstracts,
and poster sessions. Talks will feature cutting-edge
studies in the following overlapping elds: population
genomics, environmental adaptation, ecological genetics,
quantitative genetics, systems genetics, genetic engineer-
ing and conservation genomics
In addition to a full scientic program, the symposium
will feature a half-day interdisciplinary panel discussion
and workshop on the ethics of genomic interventions for
solving conservation challenges.

CALL FOR SYMPOSIUM PROPOSALS
(due March 30, 2018 at www.pr-science.org) 15th
Congress of the Latin American Association for Bio-
logical Anthropology (ALAB)
The ALAB is a corporation that brings together scholars
interested in the elds of Physical Anthropology and
Human Biology. Its members can be located in LatinAmerican countries or elsewhere if their investigations
relate to Latin America.
The ALAB congresses are held every two years since
1990, oering Latin American researchers and to those
interested in anthropological studies on Latin America
a periodic opportunity for the discussion of scientic
experiences and issues linked to the development of the
discipline in a local, regional and continental context.
The overall objective of the Congress is to bring together
scholars in our eld in a healthy environment for the
contact, discussion of problems and new ideas, and the
development of collaborative networks of researchers
and students.
We will celebrate the fteenth Congress of the ALAB
in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico from November 1 ^stto 4 ^th,
2018. It will be the rst time that the ALAB holds
its Congress in the Caribbean. We expect a dynamic
discussion of all the elds of action of biological anthro-
pology, among them: * Nutrition and growth and child
development * Nutrition, health and demographics of
ancient peoples * The Peopling of the Americas * The
settlement of Mesoamerica and the circum-Caribbean *
Forensic anthropology and human identication * Mor-
tuary rituals and treatment of corpses in ancient civiliza-
tions * Genetics of modern populations * Paleogenomics
* Biocultural Anthropology * African ancestry in the
Caribbean * Primatology * Resources and strategies for
teaching biological anthropology * Bioarchaeology and
cultural ecology * Reproductive health
Submit your symposium title and description to ALAB-

versity of Plymouth in beautiful Devon on the South
West coast of England on the 4th-6th April 2018.
This three-day conference is aimed at postgraduates and
post-docs studying animal behaviour (although open to
everyone), with a relaxed and friendly environment to
encourage rst time conference goers to present their
work.

As well as ample opportunity for poster and oral pre-
sentations, workshops will be oered on the rst day of
the conference:
Anti-CV workshop with Dr Carole Furieux and Svenja
Tidau: - a refreshingly honest session about the trials
and tribulations academics have experienced on their
road to success.
ASAB grant writing workshop with Dr Nikolaus von
Engelhardt: - focussing on applying for small grants,
this workshop will involve input from grant reviewers
themselves to help you write a successful proposal.
If that's not enough to entice you to join, Plymouth has
a lot to oer. It's situated on the border of Devon and
Cornwall, surrounded on one side by the sea and on the
other by Dartmoor national park, perfect for exploring
pre- or post-conference.
Best poster/talk prizes will be awarded at the confer-
ence.

Dear colleagues,
My co-organizer, Joanna Wolfe, and I would like to invite
you to present your research in the session 'Molecular In-
sights: The Genomic Revolution in Crustacean Biology'
at the upcoming International Crustacean Congress
IX to be held May 22-25th 2018 in Washington DC.
*The deadline forabstract submission is fast approach-
ing: March 1st 2018*
This conference is hosted by the Smithsonian Institution
and Renaissance Hotel. We hope this session will provide
a platform to share and discuss studies incorporating
crustacean genetics and/or genomics. We encourage
submissions that cover any crustacean taxa and we are
particularly interested in phylogenetics/omics, transcrip-
tomics, gene expression studies, tree of life studies, and
population genomics. Graduate Students, Postdoctoral
Scholars and Professors (at all levels) are encouraged to
participate!
If you are interested in participating please submit an
abstract and list our session 'Molecular Insights: The
Genomic Revolution in Crustacean Biology'

Co-Coordinators: Heather Bracken-Grissom, Florida In-
ternational University, hbracken@u.edu Joanna Wolfe,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, jowolfe@mit.edu
The eld of crustacean genetics has undergone an ex-
citing revolution in recent years. The advancement of
sequencing technologies and methods has transformed
the way carcinologists ask questions and collect data,
especially for non-model organisms that lack genomic
references. For several groups within Crustacea, this
'genomic revolution' is still in its infancy. The potential
to capitalize on recent technology is great, and ndings
from these studies will lead to unprecedented insights
into the elds of evolutionary biology and molecular
ecology.
For this session, we would like to invite researchers
working in the eld of crustacean genetics/genomics.
We welcome contributions from phylogenetics/omics,
population genomics, transcriptomics, among others. In
addition to the abovementioned, theoretical and method-
ological talks will be considered.
We hope to highlight a diverse group of organisms that
span various elds of crustacean biology. Please indicate
that you would like to be included in the 'Molecular
Insights' session.
We do not plan to publish a special issue.
We do not plan to apply for funding to recruit specic
speakers.
The session will accept as many talk proposals as ap-
propriate based on submitted abstracts.

YosemiteNatlPark Symbiosis
May4-6
Dear Colleagues,
The Eigth annual Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop will
take place on May 4th-6th, 2018 at the Sierra Nevada
Research Institute, Yosemite National Park. This has
become a great venue for a diversity of symbiosis re-
searchers. We hope to continue to attract a diverse
group in 2018!14 EvolDir March 1, 2018
Keynote speaker 2018: Dr. Tadashi Fukami from Stan-
ford University!
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our continuing goal is to better integrate the
broad groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis and
microbiome research. Yosemite serves as an ideal site as
it is both beautiful and secluded. This will be our 8th
annual meeting and we have been consistently attracting
scientists from all over the country and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in the mi-
crobiome, cooperation, mutualism, and symbiosis. In
the past we have covered a range of symbiosis topics
from ecology and evolution to molecular mechanisms in
dierent model and non-model systems. We would like
to make room for a diverse group of people so we will ini-
tially accept up to 3 lab members per group (including
the PI) on a rst come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held May 5-
6, 2018, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 4th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting.Past attendees and talks can be found here: http://-
www.sachslab.com/symbiosis-2015.php Abstract and
early bird registration are due on March 16th, 2018.
Where: SNRS has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room. Costs: See
details in the registration page. We will only be able to
accept credit card payments this year.

ParallelAdaptationAndSpeciation
PhD position in Rapid Parallel Adaptation at Bangor
University
Closing Date: 11th March 2018
Title: Parallel origins of contemporary heavy metal
tolerance in sea campion
Supervisor: Dr. Alex Papadopulos
(a.papadopulos@bangor.ac.uk, www.labadopulos.co.uk)
Co-supervisors: Prof. Si Creer and Prof. Gary Carvalho
Project description: Climate change, urbanisation and
exploitation of natural resources increasingly alter the
environment, posing signicant challenges for plants
and animals. We have a poor understanding of how
organisms will cope with such rapid and widespread
disruption, particularly in terms of their evolutionary
responses (e.g., adaptation). Key advances in determin-
ing the genetic and ecological characteristics that permit
or facilitate adaptation to novel environments have come
from a few iconic species in which the same adaptation
has evolved multiple times. Repeated evolution of the
same adaptive trait oers unique opportunities to in-
vestigate the replicability of evolution and ultimately
inform us about the extent to which evolution might be
predictable as our climate changes. This project will
advance our understanding of the repeatability of rapid
evolution by researching the ecological mechanisms un-
derpinning multiple origins of adaptation to heavy metal
contaminated soils in Silene uniora (sea campion).
Sea campion is a predominantly coastal species which
is native to the UK and Ireland. It has also colonised
disused mines and adapted to the heavily contaminated
soils which contain high concentrations of phytotoxic
heavy metals. Remarkably, the heavy metal tolerant
ecotype has evolved independently on at least three sepa-
rate occasions in Wales, England and Ireland within the
last 200 years. This exciting project will investigate the
frequency and timing of this parallel evolution of heavy
metal tolerance, the spatial scale over which adaptation
takes place, the potential for local adaptation to drive
reproductive isolation and speciation, and the possible
role of adaptive introgression from related species. To
do this, we will combine cutting-edge high-throughput
DNA sequencing, with population genomics, phylogenet-
ics and ecological experiments in both common gardenand eld settings. The project will provide unique in-
sights into the adaptive process in plants responding to
human-induced environmental change.
Funding: This is a fully funded PhD studentship to
start October 2018 is available in the College of Natural
Sciences at Bangor University, supported by its Great
Heritage fund. The studentship will cover the full cost
of UK/EU tuition fees, plus a maintenance stipend in
line with RCUK rates (provisional 14,553 per annum for
full time award holders) for 3 years as well as funding
for the research. This project is one of three that is
being advertised, and one PhD will be awarded to the
best candidate determined after interview.
Apply: Applications are invited from candidates who
have or are about to obtain a minimum of an Upper Sec-
ond Class Honours degree, or an appropriate Master's
degree in biological, environmental or related sciences.
The closing date for applications is 11th March. In-
terviews will be held in Bangor approximately 4 weeks
after the closing date. To apply candidates should email
a Curriculum Vitae including names and addresses of
two referees and a letter of motivation explaining why
they want to apply for the project and detailing any
relevant experience they have, to primary supervisor
Alex Papadopulos (a.papadopulos@bangor.ac.uk).
Institution: Bangor University is a vibrant research-led
institution, uniquely situated between the mountains
of Snowdonia and the sea. The Molecular Ecology and
Fisheries Genetics Laboratory (MEFGL) is a leading
research division of the School of Biological Sciences
(SBS), within the College of Natural Sciences at Bangor

DaphniaHostParasite
PhD position : Host^ aparasite interactions in hybridizing
Daphnia, from correlations to experiments
The PhD student will participate in a collaborative re-
search project with PD Dr Piet Spaak (Eawag) and
Prof. Justyna Wolinska (Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater
Ecology and Inland Fisheries, IGB in Berlin, Germany),
nanced by the Swiss and German Science Foundations
(SNF & DFG).
Eutrophication is a worldwide environmental problem
accelerated by global warming, aecting the stability of
aquatic ecosystems and having long^ aconsequences. We
will investigate if and how eutrophication aects two
interacting evolutionary processes: disease spread and in-
terspecic hybridization. We will use water eas (Daph-
nia), a well-established model in both host-parasite and
hybridization research. This project is a combination of
a eld survey, a mesocosm experiment (where trophic
conditions will be manipulated), the transcriptional pro-
ling of Daphnia exposed to stressful eutrophic condi-
tions, and the development and application of molecular
markers to study parasite evolution in eutrophic envi-
ronments. Overall, through the unique combination of
expertise and methods, this project will improve our un-
derstanding of disease spread and biodiversity loss under
dierent trophic conditions and, consequently, might
provide tools for management of aquatic ecosystems.
Within the project this position focuses on interspecic
hybridization. The main task will be participation in a
large-scale eld study and mesocosm experiment; data
collection and processing. The student will screen the
dynamics of natural and experimental Daphnia commu-
nities, using microsatellite and SNP markers. Also, the
student will conduct a large laboratory experiment to as-
sess Daphnia stress responses; here, RNA-Seq methods
will be applied. The PhD student will take advantage
of the draft D. galeata genome.
Although the student will be hosted primarily at Eawag,
exchange stays are planned at IGB. Moreover, generous
funds are available to cover attendance at national and
international conferences. He/she will be enrolled at theMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 19
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z urich.
The position will be for a period of four years, and
should start as soon as possible (spring / early summer
2018).
The ideal candidate should have good molecular skills
and a strong background in evolutionary biology, ecol-
ogy or related elds. In addition, knowledge of statistics,
bioinformatics and/or population genetics will be highly
advantageous. Excellent communication and writing
skills in English, good work ethic, and creative thinking
are desired. A Master's Degree (or equivalent) in biol-
ogy or a related subject is necessary for admission. The
working language in the group is English.
Eawag oers a unique research and working envi-
ronment (http://www.eawag.ch/en/aboutus/working/-

The project: This project aims to trace the evolution-
ary and cellular origins of vertebrate nervous cell types
and tissues, as well as the underlying genomic changes,
based on the generation and analysis of extensive single-
cell genomics datasets and complementary experiments
(e.g., CRISPR/Cas) across representative vertebrates
and outgroup species. The project is closely connected
to the project of the Arendt partner lab; together, the
labs' projects aim at reconstructing the neuron type
complement of the common bilaterian ancestor.
The candidate: The ideal candidate has a strong inter-est (and potentially experience) in both wet lab (ge-
nomic/molecular) experiments and bioinformatics anal-
yses. However, we will also consider candidates who
prefer to emphasize either wet lab or bioinformatics
work (the respective other aspect of the project may
potentially be complemented by other lab members).
The candidate should have a passion for evolutionary
biology. EU fellowship eligibility criteria: at the time
of recruitment, the candidate must not have resided or
carried out her/his main activity (work, studies, etc.)
in Germany for more than 12 months in the 3 years
immediately prior to start of the project. Short stays
such as holidays and/or compulsory national service
are not taken into account. Candidates can be of any
nationality, but are required to undertake transnational
mobility. Candidates should ideally possess a Master's
degree in a relevant academic eld, or a degree that
allows them to embark in a PhD. Candidates must be
within the rst four years of their research career. Appli-
cations from candidates who already possess a doctoral
degree will not be considered.
Research environment and location: The PhD student
will be supported by research technicians, wet lab sci-
entist, and/or bioinformaticians in our interdisciplinary
group. The language of our institute (ZMBH) is En-
glish and hosts scientists from around the world. It is
located in Heidelberg, a picturesque cosmopolitan city
that oers a very stimulating, diverse and collabora-
tive research environment thanks also to neighboring
cutting-edge institutions, in particular the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and German
Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). As pointed out above,
the project will be carried out in close collaboration
with the Arendt partner lab as well as the other labs in
the EvoCELL network. Interactions within the network
are fostered through regular meetings, courses and visits
to member labs.
Application: Please submit a CV, statement of re-
search interest, references, and a list of publica-
tions or other research output to Henrik Kaessmann

PhD position: Genomic basis of honeybee foraging and
decision-making Application deadline: 1st April 2018
We invite applications for a 3-year DFG (German Re-
search Foundation) funded PhD position (65% TVL
E13) at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,
Germany. We are looking for a highly motivated stu-
dent to study the genomic basis of honeybee foraging
behaviour. Honeybees exhibit sophisticated communi-
cation and decision-making processes. Their behaviour
is highly exible and is shaped by recent foraging expe-
riences. However, the genomic and transcriptomic basis
of decision-making in foraging bees is not well under-
stood. The PhD project will investigates if and how the
expression of behavioral genes in the brain aects forag-
ing and decision-making. The successful applicant will
perform behavioural experiments with free-ying bees,
pharmacological treatments of bees, brain dissections
and gene expression analysis using bioinformatic tools.
Students with a Masters degree in Biology and a strong
background in behaviour and/or bioinformatics are par-
ticularly encouraged to apply. Good English skills and
an ability to work as part of a team are important. Previ-
ous experience with honeybees, behavioral experiments,
bioinformatics and a knowledge of German are helpful,
but not a prequisite. The working language of our group
is English. The Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz is
interested in increasing the number of women in science.
Applications from women are therefore strongly encour-
aged. Similarly, qualied candidates with disabilities
will be preferred. The successful applicant will join an
international and interactive scientic environment with
access to state-of-the-art, newly equipped laboratories.
More information about our research interests and recent
publications can be found here: http://www.bio.uni-
mainz.de/zoo/evobio/index ENG.php. The University

LeibnizInst EvolutionRetroviruses
Advertisement of vacancies The Leibniz Institute for Zoo
and Wildlife Research (Leibniz IZW) in Berlin is Ger-
many's premier wildlife research institute. The Leibniz
IZW focuses on the life histories and mechanisms of evo-
lutionary adaptations of mammals and birds, their limits
and their conservation in natural and anthropogenically
inuenced environments. The institute operates within
the elds of evolutionary ecology, evolutionary genetics,
wildlife diseases, reproduction biology and reproduction
management.
For a new interdisciplinary research initiative , entitled
\Genome invasion: understanding the evolutionary and
functional roles of mutation and recombination at the
earliest stages of retroviral endogenization" the Leibniz
IZW oers a doctoral position (65%) in the department
of wildlife diseases.
Job description:
Up to 11% of mammalian genomes are comprised of
retroviral like sequences. The processes that generated
this large fraction of the genome involved an invasion
of germ lines by infectious retroviruses. The process of
retroviral invasion is poorly understood as most entered
the germ line millions of years ago. The research project
will focus on characterizing relatives of the gibbon ape
leukemia virus (GALV) and the koala retrovirus (KoRV)
using hybridization capture and other high throughput
sequencing based approaches on rodents and bats on
both sides of the Wallace Line. The Wallace Line is aMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 23
faunal barrier that separates Asia from a transitional
zone between Asia and Australia, and GALV has crossed
this line via unknown vector species. The GALV and
KoRV clades both contain infectious exogenous retro-
viral variants but also contain endogenous retroviruses
representing very recent or ongoing germ line invasions.
Inter- and intra-retroviral recombination appears to be
a frequent event for GALV and KoRV. The ultimate
goal of this project is to determine the role that re-
combination plays in the earliest stages of the genomic
invasion process of retroviruses. In addition to identi-
fying new GALV and KoRV like retroviruses in novel
species on both sides of the Wallace Line, retroviruses
will be tested for the functional consequences of muta-
tion and recombination of the gag and env genes in a
heterologous retroviral expression system. Part of the
project will be conducted in Australia where many of
the sample collections for regional species are housed.
Prerequisites: - Completed university degree (Master of
Science or Diploma) in molecular evolution, lab based
evolutionary virology or related disciplines); - Strong
background in molecular virology; - Experience generat-
ing and working with High Throughput Sequence data;
- Experience with cell culture and the production of
virus or viral vector particles; - Previous working experi-
ence in microorganism or genomics based bioinformatics
would be an advantage; - Prociency in English (oral
and written). We oer state-of-the-art methodology and
a stimulating research environment. For the successful
candidate, organizational skills, high motivation and
the willingness to work as part of a team within highly
interdisciplinary projects are essential. The position will
start May 1st, 2018 and is limited to three years. Work-
ing hours comprise 25,35 hours per week (65 %) with
salary and benets according to TV oD (Bund). The
place of work is the Leibniz-IZW, Alfred-Kowalke-Str.

ModelingAntibioticResistance
PhD position (3 years): Modeling the evolution of an-
tibiotic resistance
The evolution of antibiotic resistance during treatment
constitutes an instance of undesired evolutionary res-
cue. By evolving resistance, the pathogenic bacterial
population rapidly adapts to the novel environmental
conditions, escaping extinction and preventing patient
recovery. Mathematical models can help to understand
which circumstances hamper the emergence and spread
of resistant strains, while successfully eliminating the
sensitive bacteria. With this knowledge, we can hope
to be able to tailor treatment strategies accordingly.
The precise PhD project will be determined together
with the student. Potential topics concern, for example,
the dynamics of resistance on plasmids, spatial drug
heterogeneity, or the role of the immune system.
On the mathematical side, the analysis will be based on
branching process theory, deterministic ODE systems,
and stochastic computer simulations.
Applicants should have a degree in mathematics, physics,
biology, or another related eld. A prerequisite is a keen
interest both in mathematical modeling and in biological
systems. Good quantitative skills are essential. Expe-
rience in mathematical modeling and knowledge of a
programming language (C, C++, Java, R, Python) is
an advantage.
The group is part of the Department of Evolutionary
Theory at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology. The institute provides an international working
environment with an excellent infrastructure. Depart-
ments span evolutionary genetics, experimental evolu-
tion, evolutionary ecology, and theoretical biology. With24 EvolDir March 1, 2018

Topic 1: Historical Human Population Genetics Main
supervisor: Dr. Stephan Schiels
Co-supervisors: Dr. Wolfgang Haak, Prof. Johannes
Krause
Description: Human history leaves its traces in genomes,
via changes in population size and structure. By
analysing the genomes of living and ancient populations,
we can therefore directly learn about historical events,
such as migrations. In recent years, this approach has
led to many new insights, mainly in prehistoric time
periods. In this project, we want to develop advanced
analytical methodology and analyse new data to inves-
tigate events in more recent, historical, time periods,
as has been done for example in the case of the Anglo-
Saxon migrations into England (Schiels et al. 2016).
Applicants for this topic should have a Master's degree
in some eld of the Sciences, technical/analytical skills
(including programming experience), and an interest in
human history.

Graduate position (M.S.) in evolution of animal com-
munication at Murray State University (KY)
Note: Funding opportunities have recently become avail-
able (see below). To be considered for a TAship and/or
the biodiversity stipend starting in the fall semester
2018, application should be submitted by 2/21/18.
The Beckers' Lab at Murray State University accepts
a Masters student who is interested in the evolution
of animal communication starting in the fall of 2018.
Our lab uses Orthopterans (i.e., katydids, and crick-
ets) as model organisms to address questions pertaining
the evolution of animal behavior. More specically, we
study the eects of the environment (i.e., phenotypic
plasticity) on mating songs. In our main study species,
Neoconephalus triops, day length induces two substan-
tially dierent mating songs. These dierences in the
songs are comparable to species dierences within the
genus. In a collaboration with two other labs (Missouri
and West Virginia), we study the genetic underpinnings
of this behavioral plasticity and how the involved genes
relate to speciation.
A second line of research focuses on the evolutionary
arms race between katydid hosts and their eavesdrop-
ping parasites in the local population of N. triops. The
ies use the katydid mating songs to nd their hosts and
deposit deadly larvae on them. Thus, sexual selection
and natural selection act in opposing directions on male
singing behavior. The evolutionary ramications of this
deadly parasitism on male singing and mate acquisitionbehavior are the focus of future studies.
The Masters students could work on either of these
projects or on other projects related to animal commu-
nication in katydids and crickets.
I seek driven, enthusiastic, and focused students to join
our lab at Murray State University. Successful appli-
cants have a B.S. in biology, ecology, or related discipline
and are interested in studying animal behavior and evo-
lution. If you are interested in this opportunity and/or
have any questions, please email Dr. Beckers at obeck-
ers@murraystate.edu. For your application, make sure
to address in an attached document your research inter-
ests, how they relate to the Beckers' lab research, and
your GPA.
Funding for tuition and a summer stipend are available
for the N. triops project through a grant. In addi-
tion, a TAship and/or a biodiversity stipend ( $5000 per
semester) are available on a competitive basis. Review
of applications starts immediately. Deadline for applica-
tions is February 21, 2018 to be considered for a TAship

it has recently proven very informative for the study of
animal development and evolution (Martin-Duran et al.
2017 Nat Ecol Evol; Martin-Duran et al. 2018 Nature).
The project will characterise cellular dynamics during
spiral cleavage with high-resolution live microscopy, and
investigate the evolution of the genomic and molecular
mechanisms involved in the establishment of bilateral
symmetry in spiralians.
We are looking for a highly self-motivated and enthu-
siastic candidate with a strong interest in evolution-
ary developmental biology, some research experience
in molecular biology, and an aptitude with computers.
The project will involve both experimental and compu-
tational approaches, as well as molecular biology and
microscopy techniques. The successful applicant will
also have the opportunity to present their work at na-
tional and international conferences, and to collaborate
with other research groups at an international and inter-
disciplinary level. The successful candidate will need to
be able to work independently, as well as part of a team.
While training will be available, the student will also be
expected to develop prociency in molecular techniques
(e.g. gene cloning, in situ hybridization, immunohisto-
chemistry, epigenomic approaches), live microscopy, and
computational analyses of next-generation sequencing
datasets.

StockholmNHM Palaeogenomics
PhD Student Position on Palaeogenomics of Prehistoric
Climate Change
Swedish Museum of Natural History & Stockholm Uni-
versity
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This PhD project will investigate how species are af-
fected by climate change. To do this, we will use a
palaeogenomic approach to analyse ancient DNA from
prehistoric bones and teeth sampled across several well-
known severe and rapid changes in climate that took
place during the last ice age. The analyses will comprise
several animal species in Eurasia. The specic aims of
the project are to i) assess the degree to which past
warm periods led to demographic bottlenecks, ii) exam-
ine to what extent climate-induced range contractions
led to losses of unique genetic variation, and iii) use a
comparative genomic approach to investigate whether
species adapted genetically in response to rapid climate
uctuations.
For this project, good knowledge in population genet-
ics, bioinformatics as well as experience of laborative
DNA analysis are important qualications. The PhD
student will join the ancient DNA research group at the
Swedish Museum of Natural History (for further details,see www.palaeogenetics.com/adna).
ENVIRONMENT The PhD student will be employed by
Stockholm University (SU), but will be based at the De-
partment of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (SMNH). The museum is
located in Stockholm, which by many is regarded as one
of the most beautiful capitals in the world and is home
to a vibrant scientic community with several leading
research institutes as well as the National Genomics
Infrastructure at the Science for Life Laboratory. The
SMNH has a strong mission in natural history research,
and its research division has more than 170 employees.
The main supervisor for the PhD project will be Prof.
Love Dalen at the SMNH. The project is funded by the
Bolin Centre for Climate Research and the Department
of Zoology at SU, and will be co-supervised by Prof.
Anders Gotherstrom at SU.

parasitic plants. Several groups of angiosperms are para-
sites, which makes them more or less dependent on a host
for nutrient supply. This project aims at understanding
the evolution and consequences of host-parasite inter-
actions at the genomic level. The current PhD project
will primarily focus on evolution of organelle genomes
in parasitic plants. Special emphasis will be given to
Mistletoes and related genera, in which substantial and
unexpected alterations of the mitochondrial genome are
already documented. Comparative studies of completely
assembled organelle genomes will be supplemented with
targeted sequencing and analysis of selected genes.

StockholmU SexualSelection
PhD position in Ethology
at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University,
Sweden
Deadline for application: March 2, 2018.
A PhD position focused on sexual selection is available
in John Fitzpatrick's research group in the Department
of Zoology at Stockholm University. The aim of this
project is to examine how trade-os between sexual30 EvolDir March 1, 2018
ornaments, weapons and ejaculates inuence animal
sexual evolution. To successfully reproduce and leave
ospring to future generations animals must be able
to nd a mate and produce fertilized eggs. However,
animals have limited amounts of energy they can de-
vote to reproduction. Therefore, animals must balance
how they invest their sexual resources before and after
mating. Yet, we know surprisingly little about these
potential trade-os. This project will use a multidisci-
plinary approach to rigorously test the hypothesis that
trade-os exist between sexual behaviours and traits
that are important in securing a mate and fertilizing
eggs. To do this, this project focuses on the wrestling
halfbeak, Dermogenys pusilla, a small freshwater sh
where males invest simultaneously in sexual weapons,
ornaments, and ejaculates. This project will combine
breeding designs, genomic approaches, articial selec-
tion and experimental manipulations to determine if
and how trade-os among sexual traits impact male
fertility.
The work will be mostly lab oriented. However, as the
lab is currently establishing eld sites in Singapore and
Indonesia, there is the possibility for a eld component
in the project as well. The lab work will take advantage
of the new tropical freshwater sh labs in the Depart-
ment of Zoology, with room for over 6,000 aquaria and
several experimental rooms. The Department of Zoology
is already home to state-of- the-art facilities to assess be-
haviour and sexually selected traits (e.g. unique 2D and
3D behavioural tracking software, computer-assisted
sperm analysis software (similar to what is used in
human fertility clinics), high-speed cameras, spectropho-
tometers for colour analyses). The successful candidate
will join a rapidly growing sexual selection group in
the Department and will be provided with excellent
opportunities for personal and professional development
towards a successful academic career.
Qualication requirements
We are looking in particular for candidates with a strong
interest in evolutionary biology and sexual selection,
with excellent analytical ability and experience with
quantitative analyses of behaviour and other traits of
interest. Experience in working with aquatic animals in
the lab is especially meriting. Applicants who have in
principle acquired the corresponding competence in Swe-
den or in another country are also qualied. Therefore,
overseas applications are encouraged.
Applications written in English are preferred.

UBern 2 EvolutionOfCooperation
Two 3-year PhD positions: Animal Physiology and Be-
havioural Ecology
In the context of a research project nanced by
the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the private re-
search and animal conservation entity Waldrappteam
(www.waldrapp.eu) is oering two PhD positions to
investigate the costs and benets of formation ight in
birds using the northern bald ibis as a study species.
One PhD project will focus on energy consumption dur-
ing migration ight, with the main question \Why do
birds y in formation?" While we believe to know the
answer to this question (formation ight allows them to
save energy), the specic challenge will be to provide di-
rect empirical evidence for that assertion by quantifying
how much energy the birds can save. This requires a
candidate with a rm background in animal physiology.
The focus of the second PhD project is on social dynam-
ics of formation ight, with the question \How do the
birds in a formation co-ordinate and cooperate?" Con-
cerning this question, there are many tentative sugges-
tions but few empirical data at hand. In this context, we
are seeking a candidate with an interest in behavioural
ecology and/or ight mechanics and aerodynamics of
birds.
Data for both PhD projects will be collected using
high-resolution GPS devices and heart rate loggers t-
ted to free-ying birds. In addition, we plan to con-
duct respirometry measurements with birds in the lab.
Achieving this will be technically demanding and re-
quires a readiness for tinkering around with sensors and
electronic devices and spending a lot of time handling
and analysing large data sets (programming experience
in Python, Matlab, or any comparable environment will
be a plus).
The research project is aligned with an ongoing Euro-
pean LIFE+ reintroduction scheme by Waldrappteam
and partners, which aims to establish a self-sustaining
migratory northern bald ibis population in Europe.
More information about this project can be found here:
www.waldrapp.eu. The research project will mainly
take advantage of the annual human-led migrations with
human-imprinted juvenile birds. The research project
will be managed by Waldrappteam in Mutters, Tyrol,
though the PhD candidates will be based in Vienna,aliated either with the University of Vienna or the
Veterinary University of Vienna (to be decided based
on interest and academic supervision).
The research project includes several months of eld
work in summer and autumn, during which the re-
searchers will stay with the birds at eld camps in
Austria, Germany or Italy or follow the birds during
the autumn migratory journey throughout these coun-
tries. German language skills are not required but a
willingness to learn basic German will facilitate living
in Austria and positively aect social life. Payment will
be according to the salary scheme of the FWF (yearly
gross pay of approx. 37.000 Euro, for three years).
Please send your application letter together with a moti-
vation statement, your CV and contact details of one or
two reference persons (reference letters are not required
for the initial application) to: bvoelkl@waldrapp.eu. We
encourage applications of people with unusual career
tracks. Applicants from non-EU countries will have to
ensure that they are eligible to work in Austria (for
the time being, the UK still counts as part of the EU).
Please indicate your preferred and earliest possible start
date in the application letter.
Application deadline: March 18th 2018; Project start:
May 2018. For informal enquiries please contact Dr.

at University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative
(nzd.org.nz) aims to create plantations of high-
value Eucalyptus species in dry environments on the
east coast of the South Island. For this purpose,
Australian seed collections of ve Eucalyptus species
were planted in New Zealand to determine if these
species produce desirable growth and wood qualities
(e.g. low growth stress, high natural durability) in
the New Zealand environment. The proposed project
aims to use genomic tools to understand how genomic
and environmental variation interact to inuence
commercially important traits of selected Eucalyptus
species in the NZDFI common garden experiments
to: (1) Inform future genomic selection in breeding
programs, (2) Resolve the taxonomic delimitation of
two morphologically similar species (E. argophloia
and E. bosistoana), and (3) Inform the conservation
management of E. argophloia (Vulnerable) and E.
bosistoana (Near Threatened) in Australia.
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student
with eld and lab research experience in population
genetics/genomics or molecular systematics, preferably
in plants, and an interest in building strong multidis-
ciplinary relationships. Good written and spoken com-
munication skills are essential. Candidates must have a
valid driver's licence and be willing to undertake eld
work.
The successful applicant will be supervised by a mul-tidisciplinary team of researchers in the Schools of
Forestry (Drs Apiolaza and Altaner) and Biological
Sciences (Drs Pelser and Steeves) of University of Can-
terbury (Christchurch, New Zealand). The research
team is committed to Kindness in Science (kindnessin-

UCork MRes EvolutionOfCognition
MRes Studentship 18 months \Trade-os in sexual se-
lection and cognition" Why do individuals vary in their
cognitive abilities? EVOECOCOG, an ERC funded
project, takes the disciplines of cognition and evolu-
tionary biology into a natural setting to answer this
question. It aims to do this by investigating a variety
of proximate causes and population-level consequences
of individual cognitive variation using a great tit Parus
major population.
This MRes position will explore potential trade-os
between traits involved in pre-copulatory and post-
copulatory sexual selection and their relationships with
mating success and cognitive ability. The student will
perform laboratory analyses of sperm sampled from
male great tits in the breeding season to measure sperm
quality and viability, and then relate this to mating
success by performing paternity analysis using a newly
purchased state-of-the-art DNA sequencer. These mea-
sures will be compared to measures of signal quality and
cognitive ability to detect potential trade-os among
these traits.
The chosen study system, the great tit Parus major, is
one of the most widely used in Europe, and consists of
12 subpopulations across deciduous and conifer wood-
land fragments in Co. Cork, Ireland. A recent state of
the art aviary is also available for experimental study
at the School of BEES.March 1, 2018 EvolDir 35

MASSIVELY PARALLEL PHYLOGENY RECON-
STRUCTION FOR THE AGE OF DNA BIG DATA
Supervisors:
Dr Daniel Barker, University of Edinburgh, UK,
Daniel.Barker@ed.ac.uk and Professor Thomas Meagher,
University of St Andrews, UK
Note:
This opportunity is only open to UK nationals (or EU
students who have been resident in the UK for 3+ years
immediately prior to the programme start date) due to
restrictions imposed by the funding body.
Project Description:
How are species related? This question, of fundamen-
tal importance across life sciences, can in principle be
addressed using DNA sequence data. Implicit in these
data is the pattern of relationships of the species the
DNA came from, known as their phylogeny, usually rep-
resented as a tree. However, algorithms and software
to reconstruct phylogenetic trees for very large input
are lagging behind the recent explosion in availability
of DNA sequence data.
The goal of this project is to create parallel algorithms
and open-source software for reconstructing large phylo-
genies by heuristic searches suited to very large data.
The project will use theoretical and computational ap-
proaches. These will include use and characterisation
of nature-inspired advanced heuristics (e.g. Strobl and
Barker 2016), programming and use of massively par-
allel computer systems, optimisation of algorithms and
implementations, and cross-site, distributed machine
learning techniques.
Research training will be provided through various
means, including meetings with the supervisors and
with Dr Martyn Winn (STFC Scientic Computing De-
partment), attendance at short courses and conferences,
and attendance at local and regional seminars and dis-
cussion groups.36 EvolDir March 1, 2018
It is anticipated the successful candidate would gain
valuable skills and insight for subsequent employment
in computational science or life sciences, in academia or
industry.

UEdinburgh TreeImprovement
We invite candidates to apply for a PhD position based
at the University of Edinburgh, UK and Forest Research,
UK
Title: Monitoring and managing genetic diversity in
Sitka spruce
Supervised by Professor Richard Ennos (University of
Edinburgh - rennos@ed.ac.uk) and Dr. Joan Cottrell
(Forest Research - joan.cottrell@forestry.gsi.gov.uk)
Genetic diversity is a key component of the resilience of
tree populations to threats such as climate change, and
novel pests and diseases. Reduction in genetic diver-
sity leaves tree populations vulnerable to rapid climate
change, and novel pest and pathogen epidemics (Ennos,
2015). Despite its importance, we currently have no
quantitative estimates from genetic markers of genetic di-
versity in our most important commercial conifer, Sitka
spruce (Picea sitchensis Bong. Carr). This is true both
for the unimproved population introduced from NorthWest America and naturalised throughout Britain in
the twentieth century, and for the genetically improved
populations which increasingly dominate Britain's pro-
ductive forestry. These have been produced either via
open pollinated seed orchards containing selected par-
ents, or through vegetative propagation of ospring from
a limited number of half and full sib families (Lee &
Watt, 2012). The primary objective of this PhD project
is to determine the extent to which genetic diversity has
been reduced during this process of domestication of
Sitka spruce and to identify the stages in the process
that are particularly vulnerable to loss of diversity.
The genetic tools required for this study, a set of highly
polymorphic microsatellite loci, have already been de-
veloped by Forest Research (A'Hara & Cottrell, 2004).
They will be used to follow changes in genetic diver-
sity associated with the introduction of Sitka spruce
from North West America, the selection of genetically
improved parents, the production of seeds in open polli-
nated seed orchards, and the vegetative multiplication
of a limited number of superior genotypes produced by
controlled crosses. The involvement of both the Conifer
Breeding Co-operative and the Forestry Commission in
the initiation of this project means that there will be
opportunities for the student to gain at rst hand an
understanding of the practice of commercial tree breed-
ing, and to have ready access to the samples required
to conduct the study.
The student will receive training in the application of
molecular markers to investigate a range of applied ques-
tions e.g. how population genetic theory can be used
to understand mating patterns within articial seed or-
chard populations. Apart from documenting the eects
that the current tree improvement programme has had
on Sitka spruce genetic diversity, the student will also
be encouraged to explore how novel tree improvement
strategies may be used in the future not only to ensure
that genetic diversity is maintained, but also to ensure
that improved planting stock remains well adapted to a
rapidly changing climate and a biotic environment with
increased numbers of introduced pathogens.
The student will benet from complementary expertise
present at the Northern Research Station of the Forestry
Commission, and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology
in the University of Edinburgh. By gaining experience in
these two very dierent applied and academic research
settings, the student will be in an ideal position to ap-
preciate how fundamental evolutionary principles can
be applied to tackle real world problems. The results of
the study are keenly awaited by the forestry industry,
and are likely to inuence future forestry practice.

Dear colleagues,
We are advertising a fully funded SWDTP BB-
SRC/ESRC PhD position in the Centre for Research in
Animal Behaviour, Psychology, University of Exeter.
Project Title: Executive control and investment deci-
sions: an ecological perspective on planning for the
future, Psychology MPhil/PhD (Funded) Ref: 3027
About the award: This studentship is oered as part
of a call between SWBio DTP (BBSRC) and SWDTP
(ESRC) for a competition-funded studentship to com-
mence in September 2018.
Location: Streatham campus, University of Exeter
Academic Supervisors: Dr Lisa A. Leaver (University
of Exeter) Prof. Sarah Smith (University of Bristol) Dr
Tim W. Fawcett (University of Exeter)
Project Description: An individual's ability to inhibit a
pre-potent response or \executive control", often con-
ceptualised as self-control, is an important aspect of
cognitive exibility and has been used as an assay of
cognitive performance in a number of studies. Psycho-38 EvolDir March 1, 2018
logical studies of executive control often involve abstract
tests in the laboratory to measure specic inhibition-of-
response times across individuals. Executive control has
been identied as an important factor in gambling and
drug addiction, but the importance of executive control
in less extreme behaviours has been largely overlooked.
One such behaviour that is crucial for wellbeing and
ensuring future security is investment behaviour, which
necessarily entails planning for the future. Investment
in the future can take many forms across species, and
requires some degree of executive control because an in-
dividual needs to inhibit current use of an asset to store
it away for a future which is, inevitably, uncertain. Grey
squirrels are an ideal model species for studying the link
between executive control and investment because they
are natural and prolic investors. Grey squirrels are well
known to cache food widely for later use, a risk-averse
behavioural strategy that involves storing nuts during
times of plenty in order to provide a reliable source
of food when resources are scarce. Squirrels not only
decide whether to cache a food item, eat it, or reject
it, but caching itself involves a series of predation and
pilferage risk trade-os, which reliably co-vary with food
value. As such, investment decisions and eort directly
reect future discounting and ought to be linked to ex-
ecutive control. This PhD project will provide a unique
opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary research that
incorporates ecological relevance and economic decision
making. The project will investigate the role of executive
control in investment decisions by wild grey squirrels.
The student will begin by reviewing economic models
of saving (standard and behavioural) and identify how
these models might apply to squirrels. The student
will then construct a mathematical model of adaptive
investment behaviour based on executive control and
future discounting, to generate predictions that can be
tested in both squirrels and people. He/she will test
the model by collecting experimental data on squirrels
and use panel data on humans for a comparative study.
By devising eld experiments to verify abstract labo-
ratory tests of executive control, he/she will generate
reliable measures of executive control in squirrels and
measure their investment outcomes, a real-life measure
of delaying gratication.

PhD studentship
Project Details: The purpose of this multidisciplinary
studentship is to integrate fundamental and applied
perspectives on a research problem with direct societal
relevance but which also informs key questions in evolu-
tionary ecology and parasitology. The development of
resistance to chemical control measures is a key concern
in human and veterinary medicine and in agricultural
production systems. To increase the eciency and ef-
fectiveness of chemical control measures in the face of
resistance, adaptive management approaches have been
proposed that customise intervention strategies to the
biology and ecology of the particular target pathogens
and their hosts. However, these would ideally consider
the specic mechanisms of the control agent, genetics of
resistance, rates of migration between susceptible and
resistant populations, and the strength of selection im-
posed by the control agents, while taking into account
other types of environmental variation, such as the type
of pasture that hosts feed on, the community of hosts
that share pastures, and how isolated hosts are from new
infections. This requires integration of ecology, evolu-
tion, genetics/genomics, parasitology, veterinary science,
quantitative analyses of \big data", and mathematical
modelling, which has not often been achieved.
The overall aim of this studentship is to take a mul-
tidisciplinary approach to investigate the nature and
consequences of anthelmintic resistance in an important
parasite of sheep, the nematode Haemonchus contor-
tus. The project will focus on resistance to ivermectin,
which is one of the key anthelmintics for controlling
livestock parasites. The student will benet from sup-
port and resources provided by a large UK-wide con-
sortium investigating anthelmintic resistance (https://-March 1, 2018 EvolDir 39
bugconsortium.wordpress.com). The project will involve
four main elements but there will be exibility for the
student to take the project in dierent directions: 1)
using previously developed crosses between resistant
and susceptible parasites to test the genetic basis of
resistance; 2) examining 'real life' tness (e.g. ability
to establish infection, competition, mating success) and
the inuence of mating preferences, by genotyping the
adults and progeny resulting from mixed infections; 3)
testing the segregation of resistance markers in previ-
ously established lines of a free-living nematode model
system (Caenorhabditis remanei) that was selected for
ivermectin resistance to test whether there is a common
basis of resistance and similar phenotypic consequences;
and 4) using deep sequencing approaches to genotype
individuals from agricultural environments that dier
in resistance management practices to test predictions
about expected rates of resistance evolution.
The student will spend at least 3 months per year with
the Industrial CASE partner (Moredun Scientic), to
receive specic training in the requirements of the an-
imal health industry involved in the development and
registration of veterinary medicines. The company has
a remit to promote animal health and welfare through
research and education, with a particular focus on ther-
apeutics and vaccines.

65%). Project leaders: S ebastien Puechmaille & Gerald
Kerth, Zoological Institute & Museum, University of
Greifswald
*Background:* The European vertebrate fauna is highly
dynamic due to both historical climatic variation and
anthropogenic pressures. The ability of a species to
track climatic changes by range shift is expected to be a
major determinant of extinction risk (Science 313: 789).
For some species, such as the Palearctic bat species
Rhinolophus hipposideros, regressions and advances are
quite well documented and represent unique opportu-
nities to study how and why range limits move. Such
dynamic range boundaries can be observed at the North-
ern edge of the current distribution of R. hipposideros,
regions in which models of climate change predict a
northward progression of this species during the next
decades (Global Change Biol. 16: 561). Based on a
large existing dataset (20,000 genotyped samples) and
newly gathered data we will investigate colonisation and
colony formation via dispersal in the focal species, study
trade-os / associations between dispersal and life his-
tory traits, and elucidate factors inuencing dispersal,
paying special attention to social and environmental
factors.
*Goals of the projects:* Interconnected wild colonies
at the Northern edge of the species' ^A range will be
surveyed in Germany and combined with data already
obtained from France (via associated partner E. Pe-
tit). Droppings will be collected from all colonies and
genotyped using available microsatellite loci (protocol
already optimized; Mol. Ecol. Res. in press), allowing40 EvolDir March 1, 2018
for individual identication and pedigree reconstruction.
Non-invasive genotyping over consecutive years in the
colony networks will be used to estimate demographic
parameters (i.e. population size, population growth,
vital [births, deaths] and dispersal [emigrations, immi-
grations] rates). Temperature and humidity will be
monitored throughout the year within and outside the
colonies, and habitat characteristics around the colonies
will be mapped (Corine Land Cover). The project will
focus on associations between realised dispersal and re-
productive rate as well as on the inuence of population
density, social and environmental factors on dispersal
and colony formation. Specically, we will test the fol-
lowing hypotheses: (1) Dispersal (threshold trait) and
dispersal distance are heritable traits; (2) individuals
from newly formed colonies consistently exhibit higher
dispersal rates and invest more into reproduction (due
to less intense intraspecic competition in new colonies);
(3) dispersal distance is inuenced by habitat quality
and availability. The obtained results will be used to
parametrize a hybrid correlative/mechanistic model to
predict range expansion in the species. This study will
be carried out in collaboration with local conservation
agencies and Dr. E. Petit, INRA (Rennes, France).
Required skills: - The candidate should have (*or at
least be willing to develop*) skills in population dynam-
ics and population genetics, landscape ecology, man-

<s.puechmaille@gmail.com >UGroningen PhenotypicPlasticity
The Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences
(GELIFES) oers an NWO-funded PhD position for a
project on the role of phenotypic plasticity in speciation,
using African cichlid sh as a model system.
Phenotypic plasticity is a key determinant of organismal
performance, allowing rapid adjustment to environmen-
tal variation. In this project, we aim to investigate
plasticity's role in species divergence. On the one hand,
plasticity may promote evolutionary dierentiation by
facilitating range expansion. On the other hand, plas-
tic responses will weaken selection for genetic change,
hampering adaptive evolution.
We study the role of visual plasticity in the evolution
of cichlid sh species diversity. Variation in colour vi-
sion, among individuals, populations and species, is
determined by both genetic factors and phenotypic plas-
ticity. Since visually mediated behaviours inuence
both mating behaviour and ecological performance in
cichlids, plasticity in colour vision could be important
in divergent evolution. The PhD student will conduct
experiments and analyses addressing the consequences
of visual plasticity for both 1) macro-evolutionary pro-
cesses and 2) individual behaviour and tness. Ap-
proaches include behavioural experiments, molecular
analysis of visual pigments (sequencing, qPCR, HPLC)
and phylogenetic comparative analyses.

molecular ecology.html.en Lake-eutrophication during
the last century has facilitated secondary contact be-
tween ecologically important Daphnia species in peri-
Alpine lakes. The extent of secondary contact depends
on the degree of trophic change. The successful candi-
date will use recent population samples and Daphnia
resting eggs from sediment cores to quantify and char-
acterize gene ow between species and study the con-
sequences of the secondary contact on species integrity
and functional traits. The project comprises sedimento-
logical work (collecting sediment cores), molecular lab
work (DNA extractions and library preparation), and
extensive bioinformatics analyses as well as some exper-
imental work with Daphnia. The study will focus on
three large peri-Alpine lakes with dierent trophic his-
tories - Lake Constance, Lake Walen, and Lake Zurich -
and will include close collaborations with the members of
the SEEWANDEL initiative. Part of the experimental
work will be conducted at Eawag (Switzerland).
Candidates should be highly motivated and have a
strong interest in evolutionary biology, ecology, and
population genetics. The planned work will require a
high degree of independence and the ability to work in a
team. Experience in (i) molecular lab and eld work, (ii)
analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data, (iii) and
basic programming skills (e.g. R, Python, bash) will be
an advantage. The project includes several collaborators
and international groups in Switzerland, Germany, and
the UK, and therefore good English skills are essential.

Project supervisors: Prof Mark Jobling, Dr Jon Wetton,42 EvolDir March 1, 2018
Dr Celia May 'V Department of Genetics & Genome
Biology
Industrial partner: Cranswick plc
Project outline:
Adulteration of the food chain with products derived
from undeclared species greatly aects consumer con-
dence, can pose health risks and may involve the illegal
exploitation of protected species. High-prole cases
such as the 2013 horsemeat scandal increased pressure
to improve the reliability and speed of species identica-
tion. Unfortunately, current methods for checking the
species of origin of raw meats require out-sourced lab-
oratory testing using expensive equipment, which can
take up to a week. Similar delays occur when testing for
pathogenic microbes, by which time food from poten-
tially contaminated production lines may have already
reached retailers and consumers. Species identication
is also key in combatting the multi-billion dollar illegal
wildlife trade which often involves substitution of species
on a massive scale, particularly in commercial sheries
worldwide, and the sale of bushmeat - wild animals
caught in developing countries that are butchered and
sold in markets.
We seek a highly-motivated student with an interest in
genetics, genomics or forensic genetics, whose research
project will develop rapid, on-site DNA analysis meth-
ods using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)
MinION portable third-generation sequencing device.
The focus will be on mitochondrial barcode genes that
show characteristic sequence dierences between species;
a similar approach can identify bacteria from their 16S
rRNA sequences. ONT sample and sequencing prepa-
ration devices currently in development, including the
VolTRAX microuidics platform and hand-held dispos-
able DNA library preparation systems will be trialled
for utility upon release.
The student will gain an appreciation of the technology
needed to ensure food-chain integrity and will be trained
in existing approaches to species identication. During
the course of the project the student will spend three
months working with our industrial partner Cranswick
plc exploring how such tests can be integrated into the
commercial environment.
Supervision, training and academic environment:
You will be part of the Midlands Integrative Biosciences
Training Partnership (MIBTP), a BBSRC-funded Doc-
toral Training Partnership between the Universities of
Warwick, Birmingham and Leicester. As an iCASE
student, you must full the MIBTP entry requirements
and will join the MIBTP cohort for the taught modules
and masterclasses during the rst term. You can thenstart your PhD project in Jan 2019 but must complete
a 3-month miniproject (at Warwick or Birmingham)
before the end of their rst year. You will remain as
an integral part of the MIBTP cohort and take part
in the core networking activities and transferable skills
training.
You will be supervised by an experienced team and form
part of a dynamic and productive research group study-
ing human and animal genetic diversity, with projects
in population genetics, forensics, recombination and
mutation biology, and human disease genetics.

insect pest-predator interactions within agro-ecosystems
using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology
applied to current and historic samples collected from
biomonitoring networks. The specic objectives are: (1)
to establish the ecological interactions of target insect
pests using DNA-metabarcoding and examine how these
vary in space and time; (2) to identify agricultural land-
scapes with higher ecosystem service provision by exam-
ining both target and non-target insect 'by-catch'; (3)
to determine how the structure and 'robustness' of these
networks vary; and (4) develop models that integrate
species-interactions to predict how network structures
will change over the next century. For full Project Spec-
ication, go to: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iafri/learning/-

UppsalaU GenomicsPlasticity
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD stu-
dent to join Dr. Arild Husby ^As lab group at Up-
psala University (http://www.ieg.uu.se/evolutionary-
biology/husby-lab/) to study genetic basis of plas-
ticity in wing development in waterstriders in
collaboration with Prof. Abderahman Khila at
IGFL, Lyon (http://ig.ens-lyon.fr/equipes/a.-khila-
developmental-genomics-and-evolution).
Phenotypic plasticity is one of the main mechanisms by
which plants and animals adapt to changing environmen-
tal conditions and thus of major evolutionary interest.
This project will combine eldwork, lab experiments
and genomic work (crosses, RNA seq, RNAi) to study
how temperature and photoperiod inuence plasticity
in wing development in dierent species of waterstriders.
Waterstriders are a well known group of insects display-
ing wing polymorphism both between species as well
as within species in response to the environment (e.g.
J arvinen & Veps al ainen1976. Hereditas, 84, 61-68) and
are also model species in evolutionary biological studies
(Rowe et al. 1994. TREE, 9, 289-293). Several species of
waterstriders will be collected in early summer 2018 and
nymphs raised in the lab under dierent photoperiod
and temperature regimes followed by RNA seq analyses
to identify dierentially expressed genes between apter-
ous (wingless) and macropterous/brachypterous morphs.
Functional work will be done using established RNAi
protocols developed for waterstriders (Khila et al. 2012
Science 336, 585-589).
The overall goal is to identify the genetic variants re-
sponsible for wing development and their interaction
with temperature and photoperiod but there are several
lines to examine depending on the candidate interests
and qualications.
We are looking for candidates with a strong interest in
evolutionary developmental biology and evolutionary
genetics, with excellent analytical ability and experi-
ence in the analyses of life history traits. Experience in
working with aquatic animals in the lab is meriting.
The venue for the position, the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre, is situated in central Uppsala (http://-
www.ieg.uu.se). The working atmosphere is highly inter-
national with a regular recruitment of PhD students and
post-docs from abroad. The Centre constitutes an excit-
ing arena for multidisciplinary research in evolutionarybiology in a broad sense, housing some 300 scientists and
graduate students, and with research programs in, for
example, ecology, genetics, genomics and developmental
biology. Our graduate school oers a creative and stimu-
lating environment and oers a rich variety of seminars,
journal clubs, courses and possibilities to interact with
other scholars and students. Local platforms for next-
generation sequencing (http://www.scilifelab.uu.se) and
high-performance computational analyses are very use-
ful. Uppsala University is the oldest university in Scan-
dinavia and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant college
town with beautiful surroundings conveniently situated
40 minutes by train from Stockholm. The graduate
program covers four years of full-time, fully paid study.
The position can be combined with teaching (maximum
20%), which prolongs the employment with the corre-
sponding time.
Informal inquiries are welcomed and can be directed to
Arild Husby (arild.husby[AT]ebc.uu.se).

PhD Position in Musculo-skeletal modelling in lizards,
University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia.
The Clemente Lab at the University of the Sunshine
Coast, Australia is seeking outstanding applicants for
fully-funded PhD scholarships.
Our research focuses on the relationship between form,
function and ecology of living and extinct animals. One
fundamental goal in evolutionary biology is to under-
stand how size can constrain the evolution of morpho-
logical traits and limit the ability to exploit ecologicalniches. Size inuences all biological functions from cel-
lular respiration, up to how fast an animals can run
or climb. Yet to completely understand the inuence
of size on performance, we require information on the
integration of multiple systems, including the nervous,
muscular and skeletal systems.
The PhD project will contribute to research that in-
vestigates the neuromuscular and biomechanical mecha-
nisms associated with changes in body size using varanid
lizards as a model. We have collected an extensive mor-
phological dataset for this group including the muscle
architecture of varanid lizards ranging from the smallest
(7.6 g Varanus brevicauda) to the largest extant species
(40 kg Varanus komodoensis), as well as their maximum
speeds. We will use musculoskeletal models of varanid
lizards in OpenSim to predict higher level biological pa-
rameters (e.g. running speed) in both living and extinct
species. We will be able to scale our model up or down,
exploring size, or change its shape (e.g. limb length).
This will allow us to understand what the limitations to
size are, in biological systems, and at what size certain
structures no longer work. This research will have direct
implications for understanding evolution as a process of
optimisation.
Essential qualities for candidates include: - strong com-
putational and analytical skills in biomechanics
- experience using biomechanical assessment tools (e.g.
high speed video, force plates)
Preferred qualities for candidates include: - interper-
sonal skills to work eectively with patients, research
subjects, team members, and project collaborators. -
excellent critical thinking skills, ability to work indepen-
dently - research experience and practical knowledge of
research principles is required whether through previous
internship, work experience, or coursework.
- interest or previous experience in musculo-skeletal mod-
elling, e.g. SIMM/ OpenSim.
- interest in evolutionary theory

PhD Studentship Subject area: Plant genome evolution
and epigenetics University of Sussex
Project title: Evolutionary and epigenetic interactions
between transposable elements and their plant hosts
A Ph.D. studentship (42 months) is available from
September 2018 under the supervision of Dr. Alexandros
Bousios, in the Evolution, Behaviour and Environment
Group, School of Life Sciences.
Deadline: 31 March 2018
The Bousios lab is looking for a PhD student to study
the impact of transposable elements (TEs) in the func-
tion and evolution of plant genomes. TEs represent the
most abundant component of eukaryotic genomes, and
especially in plants they can occupy up to 80-90% of
their genomic content. TE activity can be deleterious
for the host, because it can cause chromosomes to break
or because new copies can insert within genes and dis-
rupt their function. As a result, hosts have developed
epigenetic defence mechanisms to suppress TE activity,
although given the abundance of TEs, these mechanisms
are not always successful.
By focusing on maize but also other fully-sequenced
plant genomes, and mostly using in silico approaches,
the candidate will attempt to shed light on the very
rst steps of TE silencing, i.e. how epigenetic defences
recognize the mRNA of active TEs. We hypothesize
that specic regions of complex structure on the TE
may play a crucial role in this process, and, hence, are
the foci of an ongoing evolutionary battle between TEs
and hosts. In addition, the candidate will study the
extent to which TEs positively inuence gene function
after they become obsolete, by 'lending' some of their
cis-acting sequences to the host regulatory system. Thisprocess, known as TE exaptation or co-option, is poorly
understood in plants.
For an overview of our research, please visit http://-
www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/bousioslab/ Please submit a
formal application using our online application system
at http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/phd/apply, includ-
ing a CV, degree transcripts and certicates, statement
of interest and names of two academic referees. On
the application system use Programme of Study - PhD
Biology.
Please make sure you include the project title and Su-
pervisor's name with your statement of interest on the
application form.
This funded position is open to Home / EU applicants
and covers fees and a stipend at RCUK rates. The
funding/duration of the studentship will not be aected
when UK leaves the European Union in 2019. Ideal can-
didates will have a solid background in bioinformatics or
computational biology, while a good understanding of
epigenetics, genome evolution or transposable element
biology is desirable. Eligible applicants will have re-
cently received an MSc and/or a First or high 2:1 BSc
in a relevant subject. Candidates for whom English is
not their rst language will require an IELTS score of
6.5 overall, with not less than 6.0 in any section.

UVienna PDF PhD
EvolutionGenomics
Title: UVienna.EvolutionGenomics
Dear Colleagues:
Applications are invited for one Ph.D. and one postdoc
position in the group of Qi Zhou in the Department
of Molecular Evolution and Development at University
of Vienna, Austria. Both are supported by the Euro-March 1, 2018 EvolDir 47
pean Research Council (ERC) grant, and planned for
two years for postdoc, and three years for Ph.D. with
possible renewal. The successful applicants will use
bioinformatic and experimental methods to study the
evolution of Drosophila sex chromosomes. Most model
species' sex chromosomes, e.g., those of human and D.
melanogaster bear few traces of their evolution, because
they are too ancient and have become too repetitive
in sequence for investigation. A fundamental question
concerns evolution biologist is what are the causes and
consequences of Y chromosome degeneration? We will
be using Drosophila species with recently born sex chro-
mosome ('neo-sex') systems to address: How does the
Y chromosome become epigenetically inert? How does
this universal evolution process drive the adaptation
of small RNA defence systems? And how does such a
male-specic arms race between parasitic transposable
elements and small RNAs fuel the changes of the female
genome? The candidates are expected to be independent
and highly motivated. Essential qualications include
demonstrated experience either in Drosophila genetics
experiments (transgenics, CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis,
in situ hybridisation) or bioinformatic studies (RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq and corresponding data analyses).
Successful applicants will receive very competitive
salary and benets (https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-
funding/personnel-costs/), and enjoy the diverse and
vibrant research environment of the Department and the
University. The group members have frequent interac-
tions with other neighbour labs of Drosophila neurobiol-
ogy (Prof. Thomas Hummel) and developmental biology
(Prof. Ulrich Technau), and have a chance to develop
other collaborative research projects. The university
is located in the city centre of Vienna, which houses
numerous world's leading research institutes including
Gregor Mendel Institute, Institute of Molecular Biotech-
nology and Institute of Science and Technology etc. The
city now has gathered many great scientists in evolu-
tionary biology (http://www.univie.ac.at/evolvienna/-
?page id=6), RNA biology (http://www.mfpl.ac.at/rna-
biology/) and there is an encouraging plan to move

UWageningen 2 SymbiontDrivenPar-
asitoidResistance
Two PhD positions: The role of symbiont-driven resis-
tance to parasitoids in greenhouse biocontrol success
Application deadline: 26 March 2018
Are you interesting in working on the fore-front of biolog-
ical control in a multidisciplinary project? Do you enjoy
combining eld work in greenhouses with experiments
in the laboratory?
If so, we have two PhD candidate positions available
in the NWO funded project: \Aphids out of control?
The role of symbiont-driven resistance to parasitoids in
greenhouse biocontrol success".
Aphids are major crop pests, both in greenhouses and
in the eld. They are now still predominantly controlled
using pesticides, which is not environmentally friendly,
nor sustainable. A very eective alternative is biocontrol
through the use of parasitoids that prevent early-stage
aphid population expansion. Unfortunately, endosym-
biotic bacteria associated with aphids can confer resis-
tance against parasitoid attacks leading to biocontrol
failure. Current knowledge is scarce on endosymbiont
variation. Moreover, research about the functionality
and the specicity of aphid-endosymbiont associations,
and the role that the symbiont community plays in
resistance is mostly lacking.
In this project, two PhD students will work closely to-
gether to provide this essential information through,
(i) monitoring and establishing the extent of aphid-
endosymbiont associations, aphid resistance, and par-
asitoid virulence, (ii) unravelling the aphid-symbiont
interactions and mechanisms of defence, (iii) determin-
ing the aphid-parasitoid interactions and variation in
virulence, in order to (iv) deliver advice on biocontrol
resource development and biocontrol application strate-
gies.
Our ideal candidates: Are highly motivated and enjoy
working in a team with the PhD candidate, a technician
and the supervisors; Have a strong background in ento-
mology, evolutionary biology and/or molecular ecology.
Some experience with bioinformatics will be a bonus;
Like to do eld work in greenhouses (and preferably have
some experience) and are good in communicating (with48 EvolDir March 1, 2018
growers); Are procient in the English language; Have
a driver' ^As license, because the eld work involves a
driving between greenhouses, elds, and the laboratory.
We oer a full-time position (38 hours), initially for 1
year after which a go/no go decision will be taken on
extension with another three years. Gross salary per
month ' ~A 2.222,- in the rst year rising to ' ~A 2.840,- per
month in the fourth year, for a fulltime appointment.
The candidates will be based at both the Laboratory
of Genetics and the Laboratory of Entomology of Wa-
geningen University & Research in Wageningen, the
Netherlands. The Laboratory of Genetics is part of
Wageningen University and works closely together with
other groups of Wageningen University. The group in-
vestigates causes and consequences of natural genetic
variation within species. Because genetic variation plays
an essential role in ecological and evolutionary processes,
we ask ecologically and evolutionary motivated research
questions. We use a wide array of organisms, ranging
from bacteria, fungi, plants and insects. The Laboratory
of Entomology aims at an interdisciplinary approach
from cellular to community level to unravel biological
phenomena underlying the functioning of insect sex de-
termination, plant-insect communities, insect vectored
diseases, insect neurobiology and insects as food and
feed.

ViralManipulationOfInsects
Wageningen University, Laboratory of Virology
PhD position: Viral manipulation of the insect brain
We are searching for a motivated PhD candidate to
execute the research project 'Insane in the brain: How
a virus manipulates a caterpillar's brain function and
behaviour to enhance transmission'. The project focuses
on parasitic manipulation of host behaviour, which is
a common strategy exploited by parasites to increase
transmission. Although exquisite examples of such be-
havioural alterations are known, the underlying mecha-
nisms are poorly understood. Baculoviruses, which are
viruses specically infecting insects, provide a unique sys-
tem to study these mechanisms. Baculoviruses alter the
behaviour of caterpillars, causing increased locomotion
(hyperactivity) and migration to the top of plants (tree-
top disease), where the caterpillars liquefy and virus
particles are released. Earlier studies have demonstrated
that the baculovirus protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)
is involved in inducing hyperactivity. The project aims
to identify the pathway(s) activated by the baculovirus
ptp gene that eventually lead(s) to hyperactive host
behaviour. Since locomotion is primarily controlled by
the central nervous system, we will focus on the brain
of the infected caterpillars. The PhD candidate will
combine a proteomic and transcriptomic approach with
detailed morphological studies on viral invasion of the
host brain and on infection of specic neurons. Iden-
tied genes, proteins, pathways and neural networks
will be further studied in-depth for their role in host
behavioural manipulation. The proposed research will
reveal the mechanism of an appealing case of parasitic
manipulation of host behaviour and contribute to our
understanding of insect behaviour in general.

# Research areas
## Evolution of HIV-1 within hosts.
Despite the availability of highly eective drug treat-
ments, HIV-1 establishes a life-long chronic infection
for which we have yet to develop a cure. When HIV-1
infects a cell, it integrates itself into the host genome
and, in some cases, enters a dormant state where it
becomes invisible to the immune system. This creates
a long-lived reservoir of \latently" infected cells that
is the main barrier to a cure. We are developing new
phylogenetic methods to reconstruct how this rapidly-
evolving virus spreads through the body and to identify
potential targets to eradicate the virus reservoir.
## Detecting transmission outbreaks.
For infectious diseases, a genetic cluster is a subset of in-
fections that have barely accumulated any genetic dier-
ences since their recent descent from a common ancestor.
Clustering has become a popular method for rapidly
screening clinical databases for potential transmission
outbreaks. Based on recent work, we now know that
clustering methods can be badly confounded by when
the infections were sampled from the population. We
are developing and validating a new approach inspired
by speciation models to detect lineage-specic shifts in
branching rates, and working with global partners to de-velop open-source monitoring systems to support public
health eorts in real time while protecting individual
privacy.
# Training environment
The Poon lab is an entirely \dry" research computing
and open-source software development group (http:/-
/github.com/PoonLab). The lab is housed in a newly
renovated space in the Department of Pathology, and
equipped with custom-built Linux workstations, a small
high-performance computing cluster and an espresso
machine. My lab mostly runs on Python, R and LaTeX
{ my objective is to enable all my trainees develop a
working knowledge of all three languages.
Western University is one of Canada's top research-
intensive universities, and home to the Western HIV
Investigators Group (WHIG), a highly collaborative
team of 8 principal investigators with diverse and com-
plementary research programs, including evolution and
pathogenesis (Dr. Eric Arts), natural resistance and
host microbiomes (Dr. Jessica Prodger), and bioinfor-
matics and phylogenetics (Dr. Poon). The adjacent
London Regional Genomics Centre provides state-of-
the-art next- generation sequencing services on Illumina
MiSeq and NextSeq systems.
Known as \Forest City", the city of London, Ontario,
features river valleys, abundant parks, tree-lined streets,
bicycle paths, frequent city festivals, an international
airport and a reasonable cost of living.
# Qualications
* An undergraduate (bachelor's) and/or master's (MSc)
degree in biology, microbiology, bioinformatics, mathe-
matics, statistics, computer science, or a related eld.
* An avid, demonstrable interest in evolutionary biology
and infectious disease research.
* Previous training or experience in *any* program-
ming or scripting language from course work, work-
shops, or online/self-directed learning. Applicants with-
out prior programming experience may be considered
if they have a strong background in quantitative meth-
ods (e.g., statistics, linear algebra, probability, discrete
math).
* Prociency in communicating and writing in the En-
glish language.
* An ability to work eectively in a collaborative envi-
ronment.
All applicants must also meet the admission re-
quirements of the university (http://grad.uwo.ca/-

France ReefEvolution
I would like to diuse on the EvolDir list the following
position. It is being made available in France on the
subject of \Evolutionary complexity of microbiomes on
coral reefs".
Link: https://www.ephe.fr/actualites/recrutement-des-
enseignants-chercheurs-2018 Prole: The successful
candidate will join the USR 3278, a research group
recognised nationally and internationally for its work
on coral reefs.
The research project will integrate the microscopic com-
ponents (bacteria, protists, algae, ...) of the coral reef
ecosystem, which have become increasingly central to
the assessment of resilience and adaptation capacities
of coral reefs to the impacts of climate change.
'Meta-barcoding' approaches, based on high throughput
sequencing techniques, have created new perspectives
to increase our understanding of biodiversity and its
potential role in adaptation processes. While recent
advances in genomic developments have revealed new
complexities within the microbiome, the physiological
consequences and deep physio-genomic impacts of the
microbiome have yet to be fully examined.
In addition to the descriptive genomic aspect of this
project, the candidate will document the evolution of
the microbiome through evolutionary scenarios as well
as the processes which have underpinned the patterns
of genetic diversity through time. It is essential that
the successful candidate has demonstrated expertise in
both genetics and in population genetics. These inno-
vative approaches will not only allow for an in-depth
analysis of the impacts of past climate change events,
a process which is essential to better understand and
manage the coral reefs of today, but will also lead to
new developments in the eld of conservation genetics.56 EvolDir March 1, 2018

MaxPlanck Jena Bioinformatics
Senior Bioinformatician position (E14 100%) Max
Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena,
Germany
The Archaeogenetics department at the Max Planck
Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Ger-
many, is oering a position for a senior bioinformatician
(E14 100%) beginning in summer 2018.
The overarching research topic at the institute is the use
of novel scientic approaches from high throughput se-
quencing of ancient DNA from human populations and
their pathogens to explore research questions related to
human history, gene-culture coevolution, and adaptation
to infectious disease. The main foci are the relationship
between humans and pathogens through time, popula-
tion migrations and dynamics on a historical time-scale,
and microbial evolution.
The senior bioinformatician position will focus on the
core business of data management, establishment and
maintenance of state-of-the-art analytical pipelines,
guaranteeing high quality outputs. The candidate is
required to manage and run the core facilities of high
throughput sequence data analysis, but will also be given
ample opportunity to develop new analytical methods
and pipelines for the analysis of large ancient DNA ge-nomic and metagenomic datasets. The position will be
at the heart of a large range of multidisciplinary projects
dealing with the (pre)history of ancient human popu-
lations, and the evolution of microbial and pathogen
communities, working closely with the researchers lead-
ing these projects. The ability to work in a large inter-
national team is therefore essential, while a passion or
interest for human history and evolution is also desirable.
Since this role also includes co-supervision of postgrad-
uate students in bioinformatics and biostatistics tasks,
experience in this area is welcome.
Applicants should have completed a Master's degree
or equivalent in biostatistics, bioinformatics, computer
science or relevant neighboring discipline, worked with
large high-throughput sequencing or SNP datasets, and
have experience with maintaining bioinformatics anal-
ysis pipelines in a server and/or cluster environment.
Prerequisites also include evidence of strong oral and
written communication skills and the ability to complete
tasks in a timely and structured fashion. Experience
in working in a scientic environment (e.g. completed
PhD) is of advantage.
The position is appointed for three years with the pos-
sibility of extension and conversion into a permanent
position.
For detailed information on the institute please visit our
website: http://www.shh.mpg.de/en The Max Planck
Institute for the Science of Human History promotes
women and encourages especially women to apply. Hand-
icapped candidates will be given
priority in case of the same professional qualication.

established with a goal to develop a nationally and in-
ternationally recognized program in the broad area of
genomics and computation. As part of the GBC, we
are currently seeking to hire a tenure-earning Assistant
Professor in the area of Bioinformatics and Computa-
tional Biology. Candidates must have a strong research
publication record and demonstrated independent re-
search, with either existing research funding, or strong
potential to initiate and obtain funding for their re-
search program. The GBC emphasizes interdisciplinary
research in genomics that covers at least two disciplines
among biology, biomedical sciences, and computer sci-
ence. In particular, the GBC is looking to expand
research programs in genomics that are enabled by next-
generation sequencing technologies and that address one
or more areas among molecular evolution, biodiversity,
microbiome research (environmental and plant/animal
health), biological model systems, infectious diseases,
translational applications for cancer, computational biol-
ogy, systems biology, machine learning and data mining.
Strong candidates in other areas of genomics will also
be considered.
The GBC members will be expected to strengthen their
individual tenure homes as well as the cluster. The list
of host departments includes Burnett School of Biomed-
ical Sciences (College of Medicine), Biology (College
of Sciences), and Computer Science (College of Engi-March 1, 2018 EvolDir 73

Research Scientist in Evolutionary Genomics: Cichlid-
Speciation
The Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences
Evolutionary and Behavioural Genomics of Cichlid Spe-
ciation
Context :
Since Darwins' \The Origin of Species" there has been a
continued interest to gain insight in the speciation pro-
cess. Initially, theories on speciation were mostly narra-
tive and focussed on the geographic modes of speciation,
while more recent work investigated the importance of
sexual selection or whether speciation rates can be trig-
gered by environmental changes. All these questions
have been addressed in the cichlid shes from the Great
African lakes that are often cited as the ultimate animal
models to investigate adaptive radiation and speciation.
To date, recently developed techniques that allow ex-
ploring genomic evolutionary issues in cichlids have for
the most part been used to link genes with the observed
phenotypic changes that are so characteristic in the
African cichlid species ocks. In contrast, we propose to
make use of the opportunities oered by the availability
of these novel techniques to investigate the genetic basis
of the speciation process itself. Therefore, our two main
objectives are to characterize the genomic dierentia-
tion that drives the speciation process, and to verify
whether/and to what extent the same genomic changes
are involved in to maintain the ???????integrity' of the
gene pools of the resulting sister species.
GENBAS: a BRAIN.be project: 'Genetic Basis of Spe-
ciation' http://genbas.be/ Tasks :
- Assistance of the GENBAS team [RBINS (Brussels),RMCA (Tervuren), University of Leuven and Univer-

- Applying phylogenomic, phylogeographic and popula-
tion genomic data analysis to resolve species boundaries
and connectivity questions
- Identication of divergent genomic regions within and
between populations/species
- Linking adaptive genomic regions with gene ex-
pression data, potentially linked to speciation/mate
choice/sexual selection genes
Prole :
- Diploma: Master in Bioinformatics, Biology or Bio-

progression beyond this scale is subject to performance.
As part of its ambitious Research Strategy the University
is making a signicant investment in its research capacity
and capability through six multi-million pound cross-
disciplinary Beacons of Excellence (Beacons). Beacons
will represent a critical mass, undertaking a coherent
and integrated portfolio of research, doctoral training
and knowledge exchange activities in a well-dened re-
search area, carrying out discovery and challenge-led
research and related activities, with an objective to be

tion will be funded by the Future Food Beacon which
has a mission to deliver world class research to help
address the challenge of providing sucient quantities
of nutritious and palatable food to a growing world
population within a changing environment\.
At the University of Nottingham, our researchers have
expertise across the food chain - from soil to molecule
to meal to deliver sustainable solutions to the global
food challenges; such as hidden hunger, less diverse di-
ets, naturally low nutrients in our staple crops and an
increasing reliance on over-processed foods mean that
more than a quarter of the world population are not
getting the goodness they need from the food they eat.
In the face of climate change we must develop new, re-
silient crops with increased yields to feed the additional
two billion people expected by 2050.76 EvolDir March 1, 2018
The Beacon is to proactively engage with the research
ecosystem within and across Faculties, in particular Re-
search Centres and Institutes. The Beacon will have
clearly identied objectives against which they will be
required to deliver in order to release funding to en-
able ongoing delivery. The role holder will advance the
discipline of Evolutionary Genomics through research,
knowledge transfer and teaching. The role holder will
also provide academic leadership to colleagues, research
sta and students.
Candidates should hold a Degree and a PhD or equiva-
lent in plant evolutionary genomics, genetics, or a closely
related eld, have a strong publication record and Inter-
national scientic reputation evidenced through a track
record of high quality publications and demonstrated
success in obtaining sources of funding, Please identify
4 papers you consider your best.
This permanent role is available immediately, the rst
5 years will focus on performing high quality research
within the Beacon. To recognise this focus the rst 5
years of the role will be 80% original research within
the Beacon, 20% contribution to other activities in the
School of Life Sciences.
The School of Life Sciences holds an Athena Silver
SWAN Award, in recognition of our commitment to
supporting and advancing women's careers in the
life sciences (STEMM). You can read more about
this initiative at http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-
sciences/documents/athena-swan-silver-award.pdf In-
formal enquiries may be addressed to Professor David

working on a plant pathogenic fungus that has some
mono repeats of almost 800 repeats, dinucleotides of
~300 repeats and trinucleotide of over 900 repeats. I
can't seem to nd much information regarding any other
organism that has such long repeats or, from an evo-

Phylogenetic models of pulsed evolution Michael Landis
(Yale) Wednesday, March 14, 2018, 1:00 PM EDT
One of the most apparent features of life is its diversity
of forms. Biologists are especially driven to learn what
evolutionary processes generated which components of
life's variation. Central to this puzzle is whether or
not phenotypic change tends to accumulate by slow
but steady increments or by rare but sudden pulses.
Although many phylogenetic models and methods are
known for describing incremental change, such as Brown-
ian motion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, models
of pulsed change have received less study, making it
dicult to measure the prevalence of competing evo-
lutionary modes. My talk provides an overview of ev-
idence, theory, and methods that have advanced our
understanding of evolutionary pulses of trait change. I
share some of my contributions on the exploration of
this topic, including recent ndings that phylogenetic
models of pulsed evolution explain a major component
of vertebrate body size evolution. I conclude with some
remarks regarding the potential for models of pulsed
evolution to aid in the study of macroevolution.

NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
in Plant Ecology and Genomics (second posting 'V up-
dated)
We have funding for two enthusiastic students interested
in enhancing their research skills and experience in plant
ecology, genomics, and bioinformatics in the Cruzan lab
at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon.
Successful applicants will become part of a research team
working on dispersal and gene ow in upland prairie
plants in Oregon and Washington under pressure from
climate change. Dispersal is critical for colonization,
gene ow, and range expansion 'V it is one of the most
important but least understood aspects of the ecology
of plants. Our research utilizes genomic techniques to
detect the eects of dispersal over dierent spatial scales.
This is an integrative research program that includes
eld work, wet lab preparation of genomic DNA for
next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics processing
of sequence data, and analysis of patterns of gene ow
using GIS and landscape genetic methods. Students
will be exposed to a wide range of methods and are
expected to develop an independent research project
within the scope of the larger research program. More
information on our research is posted on our lab web
site: https://cruzanlab.weebly.com/ . Students will be
fully supported for 10 to 12 weeks during the summer of
2018. Funding is provided from an REU supplement to
our National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology
grant. Housing will be provided on campus along with
a daily allowance for food and a $500 weekly stipend.
The start of the REU is negotiable with optimal start
dates between May 1 and June 17.
To apply please email us an updated copy of your CV
(including GPA) and a short (one page) statement of
your research interests and experience, as well as goals
for your education and career. Applicants should ar-
range to have one or two faculty members provide a
letter of recommendation (email is ne). Students with
experience in computer programming and/or bioinfor-
matics are encouraged to apply. Application deadline is
20 February 2018. Feel free to email us with questions.

Smithsonian Panama Intern
LizardAdaptation
Internship opportunity: Evolutionary responses to cli-
mate change in tropical lizards
Application deadline: March 15th, 2018
Recent studies have argued that tropical organisms are
particularly vulnerable to climate change because they
are adapted to the thermally stable tropics. In other
words, they are \thermal specialists" incapable of deal-
ing with even small changes in temperature. For animals
like lizards that have limited dispersal ability, evolution-
ary adaptation may be their primary means to avoid
extinction. But can lizards evolve fast enough to keep
pace with global warming? Is there sucient pheno-
typic variation in tropical lizard populations for selection
to act upon? If so, what is the genomic basis of this
variation?
We are conducting a large-scale transplant experiment
aimed at measuring evolutionary change in real time,
testing hypotheses about thermal adaptation and the
evolutionary capacity of tropical animals in the face of
rapid, catastrophic warming. We are looking for one
or more interns to join us at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute (STRI) as we sample lizards from
a series of experimental islands in the Panama Canal.
The internship will run from September through Novem-
ber, 2018, and is open to undergraduate or graduate
students (or recent grads looking for additional eld ex-
perience). Prior experience with hand-catching lizards
is preferred, but not necessary, as is prior experience
in the tropics (preferred but not necessary). We partic-
ularly encourage members of underrepresented groups
(women, minorities, rst-generation college students,
etc.) to apply.
The intern will be integrated into an international team
of evolutionary biologists and ecologists working on this
project. The intern will be trained in a number of eld
and laboratory techniques. These include (but are not
limited to) eld capture and processing of live Anolislizards, measuring morphological traits, respirometry,
estimation of thermal tolerance and eld body tempera-
tures, habitat monitoring using a drone, tissue sampling
and DNA preservation, and visual elastomer marking
techniques for mark-recapture studies. In general, the
intern will be exposed to a vibrant scientic atmosphere
of dedicated, passionate researchers working in one of
the most complex and pristine tropical environments on
the planet.
The intern will apply through the STRIs in-
ternship program: http://www.stri.si.edu/-
english/education fellowships/internships/resear
chexperience tropics.php
The deadline for applications is March 15 ^th. The in-
ternship stipend is $1000/month which comfortably cov-
ers room and board in Panama. There is no allowance
specically for travel. This program is competitive, will
applications being evaluated by a committee of Smithso-
nian sta scientists. As such, there is no guarantee that
any individual application will be approved. However,
project PI Mike Logan (Biodiversity Genomics Postdoc-
toral Fellow at STRI; www.evolutioninthetropics.com)
will work with individual applicants to improve their
essay and increase their chances at getting accepted.
Please email Mike (mike.logan1983@gmail.com) for
more information and to see if you're interests match
the goals of the project. Please attach your CV to the
rst email.

UGeorgia REU PlantAdaptation
Jill Anderson at the University of Georgia is searching
for an enthusiastic undergraduate with a strong interest
in evolutionary ecology for eld research in an NSF REU
position (National Science Foundation, Research Expe-
rience for Undergraduates) from June-August 2018. We
study the ecological and evolutionary consequences of
climate change for natural plant populations. We focus
on research on Drummond's rockcress (Boechera stricta
in the plant family Brassicaceae), a mustard plant na-
tive to the Rocky Mountains. Our studies take place
around the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (http://-
www.rmbl.org/), which is located in Gothic, Colorado
near the wildower capital of Colorado (Crested Butte).
We quantify plant tness and traits to ask whether cli-
mate change could disrupt long-standing patterns of lo-
cal adaptation, and to test whether phenotypic plasticity
will enable populations to persist in the short-term. We
perform large-scale reciprocal transplant experiments
to examine patterns of adaptive evolution and natural
selection in contemporary landscapes. Since fall 2013,
we have planted >150,000 seeds and seedlings into ve
experimental gardens ranging in elevation from 2500
m to 3340 m (8202 feet to 11000 feet). Our summer
research involves intensive monitoring of these exper-
imental plants to record data on germination success,
survival, growth, reproductive success, as well as life
history and morphological traits. We conduct most of
our work in the eld, with a small proportion of indoor
lab work.
The successful candidate will assist with ongoing eld-
work. In addition, there are many opportunities for
students to develop independent projects associated
with our overall objectives, including studies on: 1)
population divergence in ecologically-relevant traits, es-
pecially drought, UV tolerance, and herbivore resistance;
2) phenotypic plasticity at multiple spatial scales; 3)
population density and species composition of the her-
bivore community that attacks Drummond's rockcress;
4) ower color polymorphism; and 5) the importance
of maternal eects in biological responses to climate
change.
We are oering a stipend of $500/week for a full time
REU student (40 hours/week) for 10 weeks. The exact
start and end dates are exible. We will cover room and
board at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory andreimburse travel expenses up to $500. Fieldwork will
involve hiking to experimental gardens through rough
terrain (1-3 miles one-way daily).
The University of Georgia is committed to maintaining
a fair and respectful envi ronment for living, work, and
study. To that end, all qualied applicants from indi-
viduals with a strong interest in evolutionary biology
will receive conside ration for employment without re-
gard to race, color, religion, sex, national ori gin, sexual
orientation, gender identity, disability status, or age.
The applic ation consists of a cover letter listing your
qualications, a CV/ resume and contact information
for two references, all of which can be emailed to Dr.
Jill Anderson at: jta24@uga.edu
Applications are due by March 16 ^th, 2018.
Feel free to contact Dr. Anderson if you have
any questions about the position. Additional infor-
mation about our work can be found at: http://-

CharlesU EvolutionaryImmunology
Dear colleagues,
The Evolutionary and Ecological Immunology (EEI)
group at the Faculty of Science, Charles University,
Prague, is currently advertising a 2.5-year PostDoc po-
sition in avian neuroimmunology with deadline for ap-
plications 1st March 2018.
I would be grateful if you could circulate the following
advertisement at relevant fora or pass it to whom it may
concern.March 1, 2018 EvolDir 93
*Impact of neuroinammation on brain development
and learning in cognitively advanced birds* *Available
from May 2018 to December 2020 (the starting date is
exible) ** **Application deadline: 1st March 2018*
Neuro-immune interactions involved in neuroinamma-
tion directly inuence psychological processes including
mood and cognition. Inammation plays an important
role in aetiology of depression, a mood disorder that
aects 350 million people worldwide. Since ~40% of pa-
tients do not respond to current therapy, novel research
approaches are needed to allow deeper insight into evolu-
tionarily conserved interactions between immunity and
brain function.
*The objective *of this PostDoc project is to link local in-
ammation in birds with neuroinammation and provide
evidence for its eect on brain development and func-
tion. Methods such as immunocytochemistry, isotropic
fractionation, tissue-specic RNA-seq, RT-qPCR and
proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal uid through gel-free
quantitative LC-MS/MS will be used and biodiversity-
based approach adopted. Focusing on birds that repre-
sent superior models for research in cognition to rodents
(passerines and parrots), this PostDoc project opens
new possibilities for interdisciplinary research of neu-
roimmunology.
This project solves 3 main scientic questions: 1)||
| What is the eect of inammation in periphery on
immunological activity in avian brain? Inammation
in periphery triggers cytokine signalling that acts sys-
temically to aect distant organs. Inammation may
be propagated across the blood-brain barrier to induce
neuroinammation in which microglia are activated in
brain. Task 1 (T1): To describe the gene expression
changes (transcriptomic and proteomic) in brain regions
that respond to acute/chronic inammation in periph-
ery in selected species. T2: To show the patterns of
inammation-induced microglia activation in distinct
brain regions.
2)||| How the neuroinammation inuences neuro-
genesis and neuronal activity in birds? Activated mi-
croglia alter synthesis of monoamine neuromodulators,
which disturbs neurocircuits involved in decision-making,
mood-regulation and memory. Long-term failure to reg-
ulate neuroinammation may signicantly aect brain
function including neurogenesis. T3: To explore brain
neurogenesis and neuronal activity changes induced by
experimentally induced neuroinammation (adult/early-
life).
3)||| Does neuroinammation alter avian learning
or mood? Inammation-induced changes in brain may
alter behaviour. In birds, behaviour indicating cognitive
abilities and mood can be measured. The early-life in-ammation may increase probability of developing mood
disorders later in life. T4: To investigate the eect of
inammation in early life/adulthood on cognition and
mood.
*Requirements:* We seek for a researcher with expe-
rience in neurobiology, histology, immunology and/or
zoology - PhD degree in one of these or related elds,
good English language skills and (at least basic) statis-
tical skills required.
*Oers:* We oer a Research Fellow position at the
Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles
University based in Prague, Czech Republic, EU. This
is a full time, ~two and half ( ~2.5) year xed term
contract *starting from April-June 2018 (exible),
ending on 31.12. 2020 (xed)*. *Salary: **37,000
CZK per month** (444,000 CZK ~euro 17,500 per
annum; * above local average salary, fully sucient to
cover living costs in Prague) plus moving in allowance

a PhD student for 3 yrs but postdoctoral applicants
(for 2 yrs) can also be considered. Within the project,
opportunities exist to apply articial insemination,
microsatellite-based paternity analysis, autouorescence-
based advanced microscopy and mass spectrometry to
disentangle genetic from environmental eects on sperm
function. The successful applicant will join an interna-
tional laboratory at TU Dresden (Germany) (https://-
tudaz.net).
Successful candidates have previous experience, or
strong interests, in at least one of the methods (pro-
teomics, cell metabolism, confocal microscopy, paternity
analysis) and one of the concepts (ecological speciation,
phenotypic plasticity, sperm ecology). The position is
paid at TVL E13 65%, amounting to at least 18-20 k

Eilat Israel EvolutionSuctionFeeding
Postdoctoral position in Fish Functional Morphol-
ogy/Feeding kinematics at the Red Sea, Eilat, Israel
and UNC Chapel Hill
Qualications:The position, funded in part by the US-
Israel Bi-national Science Foundation, represents a
joint position in the labs of Roi Holzman (http://iui-
eilat.ac.il/People/AcademicStaProle.aspx?sid6) and
Christopher Martin (http://labs.bio.unc.edu/martin/).
The candidate will be positioned at least 9 months per
year in the lab of Roi Holzman in Eilat, Israel (http://-
iui-eilat.ac.il/), and may spend up to 3 months at UNC.
The research will center on the evolution of suction feed-
ing. The researcher will use in situ high-speed video
cameras to capture feeding events by reef shes in the
Red Sea. They will then compare the kinematics of
these natural capture events to kinematics predicted
as optimized according to a hydrodynamic simulation
(the SIFF model, Holzman et al 2012 JEB). Ultimately,
these analyses will test the hypothesis that a complex
performance landscape for suction-feeding may drive
kinematic diversication within the Red Sea community.
For the successful candidate, there will be a relatively
high degree of exibility in terms of specic research
questions and methods as long as they are within the
overall framework of our grant. We aim to do funda-
mental research on sh ecology and diversity in order
to better predict the evolution of phenotypic diversity
in coral reef shes.
The appointment is for one year, with possible exten-
sions for two more years. Annual support will amount to
102,000NIS ( ~ $30,000 at current exchange rate). Trav-
eling expanses to UNC will be covered by the grant.
Applicants from under-represented and diverse back-
grounds are especially encouraged to apply. We broadly
dene diversity to include race, gender identity, national
origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orien-
tation, political background, and physical ability.
The work place is at the Inter-University Institute for
marine sciences in Eilat, Israel (http://iui-eilat.ac.il/).Research activities at the IUI span the whole spectrum
of marine sciences, including ecology, chemical, physical
and biological oceanography, ichthyology, Invertebrate
and vertebrate biology, neurobiology, molecular biology
and marine biogeochemistry. IUI is located on the shores
of the Gulf of Aqaba, Red sea, next to a natural and
ourishing coral reef. IUI is the home of seven resident
faculty groups, with ~40 students and ~40 technical and
administrative sta. Many of the students and sta
in IUI are international, and virtually all the academic
activity in IUI (seminars, lectures, discussion groups) is
done in English.
UNC Chapel Hill supports a vibrant community of evo-
lutionary biologists interested in speciation, adaptive
radiation, and functional morphology, both within the
department and the greater Triangle area through the
Physical Biology of Organisms (PBO) group. The post-
doc will be integrated into departmental activities and
will receive mentoring in professional skills. The qual-
ity of life in this area is consistently rated among the
highest in the nation.
Basic qualications:
Strong background in sh functional morphology, biome-
chanics, or evolutionary ecology. Applicants should have
a PhD in a relevant eld of biology, ecology, or environ-
mental science and a strong interest in sh evolutionary
ecology, functional morphology/ecology, biomechanics,
and adaptive radiations. Statistical programming expe-
rience is also required. This position involves extensive
underwater eldwork using high-speed video cameras to
lm reef shes in the Red Sea at Eilat, hence ability to
work in the sea is needed.
Preferred qualications:
Advanced statistical programming skills in R and back-
ground in sh functional morphology, particularly kine-
matics or PIV. Additional experience with morphomet-
rics, Matlab or python, and marine eldwork is also a

INRA ValdeLoire
QuantPopulationGenetics
We are looking for a highly motivated, creative and en-
thusiastic young scientist to join our team \/prediction
and management of genome and population diversity
in forest trees/" within the BioForA research Unit at
INRA Val de Loire (Orl eans, France). Our ideal starting
date is June 2018, but there is some exibility.
Context and project description
Genome-wide evaluation (GWE) is a disruptive breed-
ing methodology for many species. One of the key
advantages is the accuracy with which the Mendelian
sampling term can be assessed, with the consequence
being that extra genetic gain can be produced without
further increase in inbreeding. Last two decades have
seen GWE research focused on factors aecting accu-
racy (estimation methods, data integration and design
of training populations among others). Comparatively
little has been done on the impacts that this extra ac-
curacy might have on the genetic diversity at the whole
genome scale. GWE can accelerate the sequence of se-
lection cycles, with consequently faster accumulation of
inbreeding / time. This happens whenever phenotypic
evaluation determines the length of the breeding cycle
and both genotyping and mating are available at much
earlier stages, which is the case of many perennials like
forest trees. Therefore, GWE presents some contrasting
prospects for tree breeding, with earlier precision but
faster drift, in a global context of climatic change that
requires a rationalization in the use of available forest
genetic resources over the long term.
Some solutions exists since the advent of pedigree-
based evaluation, like optimum contribution selection
and mate allocation, which use average coancestry con-
straints. However, information of inbreeding or diversity
variation across genomic regions is neglected when con-
structing such constraints. Indeed, genomic regions
might be aected dierentially by boosted selection
pressures, like those of GWE, and this be reected into
variation in drift and loss of diversity across markers.
The successful candidate will contribute to perfect a
prototype under development in our team for selection
and mate allocation that accounts for the across genome
diversity in prospective ospring. The tool will be de-102 EvolDir March 1, 2018
vised to improve coherently genetic gain and diversity
management in the context of GWE, by setting specic
weights depending on the genomic regions of interest.
This tool will be assessed via computer simulations with
in-house tools and through a proof-of-concept in black
poplar, for which mating is a key element in the breed-
ing. Real data and tools are already available. Work
will be done in collaboration with a PhD student of our
team, who has already developed the rst GWE models
in poplar and has monitored the rst impacts of their
use on genome-wide diversity. The goal of the postdoc
is to produce a methodological paper, accompanied by
the release of a tool, and to contribute to a case study
paper.
Research environment
Our team has long research experience in genetics, ge-
nomics and biometry, as well as in conducting breeding
programs for several of the main commercial tree species
in France, including the model species of the project,
black poplar. The successful candidate will interact with
a multidisciplinary team of geneticist and physiologists,
and will nd readily local support on key issues like
bio-informatics, if revisiting genomic data is eventually
required, or high performance computing where the host
has all required resources, locally and remotely.
The postdoc is funded by H2020 GenTree (http://-
www.gentree-h2020.eu/), and there will be opportunities
to interact on the subject with the consortium scientic
community.
We believe our team will make a great scientic envi-
ronment for a young scientist. Moreover, Orl eans is
attractively situated by the beautiful Loire River, oer-
ing rich culinary, cultural, and outdoor possibilities.
Required qualications & skills
We are looking for candidates with a Ph.D in quantita-
tive, population genetics or statistical genomics, with
experience in genetic analysis and programming (C,
FORTRAN, R). Experience in developing and/or using
simulation tools in quantitative/population genetics is
a denite plus.
The candidate will be encouraged to contribute to the
scope and reach of the project by own ideas and ap-
proaches. An eventual extension of the grant will be
highly conditioned to the holder's input, to the level of
fulllment and holder's involvements. We expect from
the successful candidate to be independent, creative,
and with strong collaborative skills.
Terms & salary
12 months contract. Salary could vary depending on ex-
perience. For the equivalent to a permanent researcherwith 5 years postdoctoral experience: 3,700 euro before
taxes.

SnapdragonPopulationGenetics
A postdoctoral position is available, for eld research
into the population genetics of Antirrhinum (snap-
dragon). The project focusses on a hybrid zone in the
Pyrenees, between subspecies that dier in ower colour:
plants in the hybrid population have been genotyped
for major genes that determine ower pattern, and for
large numbers of SNPs that allow the pedigree to be
determined over multiple generations. The aim is to
nd why the subspecies remain distinct, and how they
diverged from each other, and more generally, to use this
long-term study to understand the interplay between
selection and population structure in nature.

MasseyU ComputationalGenomics
Postdoc in Computational Genomics Massey University,
New Zealand
I am looking for a motivated postdoctoral fellow to ex-
plore the evolution of genome structure in lamentous
fungi. My group is interested in interactions between
genome structure and gene expression, epigenetic modi-
cation and 3D conformation. A key focus of this postdoc
will be on how interactions like these change over evo-
lutionary time. This research program will build on a
growing set of genomic data for the genus Epichloe, an
increasingly important model system for studying the
genome evolution of haploid and polyploid fungi.
The postdoc will be expected to help develop her/his
own research program, with an emphasis on addressing
novel hypotheses rather than data description. This
analytical position requires solid quantitative and com-putational skills, with the ability to develop and apply
new bioinformatic applications to genome analysis. At
a minimum, some condence in bioinformatics and a
programming language is required. Training in fungal
biology or genomics can be provided as needed, and can-
didates from non-standard research backgrounds with a
clear t to the position are encouraged to apply.
Funding is guaranteed for two years and three months,
but may be extendable. Salaries are extremely compet-
itive, starting at NZ $69,000, considerably higher than
comparable salaries in the US and Europe. Items consid-
ered benets in some other countries, such as healthcare
coverage, are a standard right in New Zealand.
My research group aims to achieve work-life balance
within a productive scientic environment. The team is
rmly embedded in the international scientic commu-
nity, with extensive collaborative links to Australia, Asia,
Europe and the United States. Ongoing training is a key
focus for postdocs. As a computational biology group,
I oer a supportive environment for computationally-
inclined postdocs to work towards independence. The
successful candidate will not be a lone bioinformaticist
isolated in a bench biology group.
My group is highly international, and applicants from
all countries and backgrounds are actively encouraged
to apply. Members of underrepresented groups are wel-
come, as are postdocs with families.
The position will be based in my computational biol-
ogy research group at Massey University in the city of
Palmerston North, New Zealand. This oers a rare op-
portunity to experience New Zealand's unique natural
and cultural environment, while still undertaking world
leading research. Palmerston North, a university town
with a large international community, oers a full range
of social and cultural amenities. The city is located
between mountains and the sea, and presents regular
opportunities for hiking, skiing, surng and adventure
sports. It also has a good caf e scene for those of a more
cosmopolitan bent.

EvolutionSexPygmyMice
A two-year post-doctoral position is open at Institut
des Sciences de l' ^AEvolution, Universit e de Montpel-
lier, France, to study evolutionary genomics of natural
sex-reversal in a mouse species.
In natural populations of the African Pygmy mouse
(Mus minutoides), two types of X chromosomes co-exist,
one of which (named X*) is feminizing. This induces
a drastic change in the modes of transmission of sex
chromosomes, which in this system can thus be either
strictly female (X*), or bisexual (X and Y). We study in
the lab dierences of life-history traits associated with
the dierent sexual types (XX, X*X and X*Y females,
XY males), in order to understand how this new mode
of transmission contributes to the evolution of sex-linked
phenotypic dierences and of potential antagonism over
their control.
The post-doc will study the genomic aspects of this
question, by analyzing various available datasets:
-Participate in the /de novo/ assembly and annotation
of the X and X* chromosomes.
-Analyse dierential gene expression between sexual
types from RNA-seq data.
-Analyse population genomics data.
The post-doc will work in Montpellier at Institut des
Sciences de l' ^AEvolution (with Fr ed eric Veyrunes and
Pierre Boursot), in close collaboration with The Earl-
ham Institute, Norwich, UK (David Thybert) and the
Institut de G en etique Humaine, Montpellier (Francis
Poulat).
The candidate should have strong proven skills in bioin-
formatics for genomic data analyses (genome and tran-106 EvolDir March 1, 2018
scriptome sequences). A background in biology (molec-
ular or evolutionary biology) would be a plus.
The candidate should preferably have defended his/her
PhD no longer than 4 years before the start of the
post-doc, and should preferably not have worked in
Montpellier during the last two years.
Salary will be according to the rules of Universit e de
Montpellier, up to 2200 Euros/month net, depending
on experience.
Starting date: from May 2018 to October 2018 at the
latest.
Deadline for application: March 12, 2018. The call may
be prolonged beyond this date in case it is not fruitful.

GenomicsTeachingResearch
The Department of Biological Sciences at Smith Col-
lege invites applications for two full-time postdoctoral
fellowship positions in genomics, to begin in July
2018. More information is below and here: http://-
apply.interfolio.com/48740
Postdoctoral fellows will be expected to teach two
courses each year in the areas of genetics and molecularbiology, bioinformatics, and/or a seminar in the area of
specialization of the candidate. Research will focus on
genomic approaches to studying microscopic eukaryotes
or animal parasites, and postdocs will be encouraged to
work with and mentor undergraduates.
One postdoctoral fellow will work in the laboratory of
Laura Katz (microbial eukaryotes) while the other will
work in the laboratory of Steven Williams (human and
other animal parasites), both in the Department of Bi-
ological Sciences. Ph.D. in Biology or relevant eld is
expected by time of appointment.
*****
Research in the Katz lab aims to elucidate principles
of the evolution in eukaryotes through analyses of mi-
crobial groups, and to assess how these principles apply
(or fail to apply) to other organisms. Currently the
Katz lab focuses on three interrelated areas: (1) char-
acterizing evolutionary relationships among eukaryotes
using single-cell 'omics' and phylogenomics; (2) Ex-
ploring the evolution of germline vs somatic genomes;
and (3) describing the phylogeography and biodiversity
of protists in local environments (bogs, fens, coastal
habitats). Information about the Katz lab can be
found at http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/-
Biology/lkatz/Research.htm Research in the Williams
lab focuses on the molecular biology/genomics of par-
asites that cause neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)
in humans (particularly lymphatic lariasis and soil-
transmitted helminths). Many of the lab's research
objectives involve PCR-based diagnostics, molecular
xenomonitoring using insect vectors, drug development
and studies of gene expression coupling bioinformatics
and wet lab experimentation. The Williams lab also
conducts research on parasites of marine mammals that
will be crucial to the maintenance of healthy wildlife
populations. Information about the Williams lab can
be found at http://www.science.smith.edu/sawlab/.

jobs?rmlang=UK&rmpage=job&rmjob=4625 Project
description The position will be associated with the
project Genome evolution in parasitic plants. Several
groups of angiosperms are parasites, which makes them
more or less dependent on a host for nutrient supply.
The overall aim of this project is to understand evo-
lution and consequences of host-parasite interactions
at the genomic level, by using comparative methods to
reveal unique or shared evolutionary pathways leading
to a fully parasitic way of life. While current research is
focused on organelle genome evolution, this project will
shift emphasis to the nuclear genome e.g., by integrating
data from transcriptomics and targeted sequencing into
the framework.
Main responsibilities The research associated with this
position includes analysis of existing data as well as
molecular laboratory work to generate new data. The
successful candidate will use a suite of bioinformatics
tools for processing, characterizing and analyzing data.
Qualication requirements Postdoctoral positions are
appointed primarily for purposes of research. Applicants
are expected to hold a Swedish doctoral degree or an
equivalent degree from another country.
Assessment criteria The degree should have been com-
pleted no more than three years before the deadline for
applications. An older degree may be acceptable un-
der special circumstances, which may involve sick leave,
parental leave, clinical attachment, elected positions in
trade unions, or similar. In the appointment process,
special attention will be given to documented prociency
in the use of Next Generation Sequencing techniques
and application of bioinformatics tools for downstream
analyses including phylogenetic analysis. A good knowl-
edge of plant systematics is desirable. In addition, we
expect the candidate to have excellent team-working
and communication skills.
Terms of employment The position involves full-time
employment for a maximum of two years, with the pos-
sibility of extension under special circumstances. Start
date 2018-09-01 or as per agreement. Stockholm Univer-
sity strives to be a workplace free from discrimination
and with equal opportunities for all.

Postdoc position: long-term trends in protein evolution
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna Masel
(http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at the Uni-
versity of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist des-
tination surrounded on all four sides by mountainous
national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city of
nearly a million people with an attractive climate. The
EEB department was ranked in the top 10 by US News
& World Report.
We recently found that genes of dierent ages en-
code proteins with dierent computationally predictable
structural properties, forming an extraordinarily long-
term trend (see https://doi.org/10.1101/176867). This
project will use bioinformatics techniques to discover
whether these long-term trends are really a consequence
of evolution by descent with modication that continues
for long periods of time in a consistent direction. It
will also provide a major new annotation of genes based
on homology, in order to begin removing the problem
of phylogenetic confounding within gene families from
\correlomics".
Techniques used may include phylostratigraphy (assign-
ing ages to gene families), ancestral sequence recon-
struction, and porting macroevolutionary techniques
for studying speciation and extinction to the study of
gene duplication and loss. A high level of statistical
sophistication is required throughout.
Excellent computer programming skills are strongly pre-
ferred, ideally with bioinformatics / genomics and statis-
tics experience. Exceptionally strong candidates who
come from a more experimental background within evo-
lutionary biology, and who now wish to retrain as bioin-
formaticians, will also be considered. A background
in evolutionary biology is also strongly preferred, al-
though again, exceptionally strong computational sci-
entists from highly quantitative backgrounds outside
evolutionary biology will also be considered. Statistical
knowledge, and knowledge about protein structure and
folding, are advantages. Start date is negotiable, and
the position is renewable, with funding secured through
July 2020.

UC Santa Cruz department of Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology (EEB) is recruiting one full-time postdoc-
toral scholar to perform environmental DNA (eDNA)
research and science education outreach. The position
is ideal for a candidate with a background in molecular
biology. In collaboration with project partners in the
department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB)
at UC Los Angeles, the postdoctoral scholar will help
establish a new education program called eSIE: environ-
mental DNA for Science Investigation and Education,
supported by a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute (HHMI) jointly awarded to UCSC and UCLA.
The scholar will work with a team of researchers and sci-
ence education experts on eDNA research that connects
to the eSIE program.
Why eDNA?
eDNA is a highly sensitive molecular approach to cata-
log biodiversity in any ecosystem. The results can reveal
a near complete diversity prole of the ecosystem from
microbes to plants and animals, and can enable track-
ing biodiversity changes over time. UCLA and UCSC
have pioneered cutting-edge methods to obtain eDNA
data, from citizen science to packaged computational
pipelines. Our goal with the eSIE program is to use
the excitement and wide application of eDNA as a new
gateway for students to enter research avenues in the
environmental sciences.
The postdoctoral role in the eSIE program:
The postdoctoral scholar will help co-develop and man-
age eSIE program while receiving training focused on
the advancement of science education. eSIE reaches
a broad undergraduate constituency by involving hun-
dreds of students annually in CALeDNA bioblitzes on
UC Natural Reserves (www.ucedna.com). The postdocMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 117
will help select eld sampling, ideally around research
questions of their interest, and travel to do eld collec-
tions at natural reserves around the entire state. eSIE
will also launch a multidisciplinary ipped course to
introduce undergraduates formally to STEM subjects
through DNA and eDNA activities. The postdoc would
co-design the course with the eSIE team, and receive
training through the Center for Education Innovation
and Learning in the Sciences (https://ceils.ucla.edu) at
UCLA (remote learning possible). The eSIE program
also supports students who enter research labs. The
postdoc would be expected to occasionally work with
student research interns.
Research scope:
The postdoc will be encouraged to pursue environmen-
tal science research that uses the eSIE-generated eDNA
data and sample collections. They will join the lab group
of Beth Shapiro <https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/faculty/-
singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz id=bashapir >
(UCSC), who' ^As lab focuses on evolution, paleoge-
nomics, and conservation genomics. They will also join
the UC Conservation Genomics Consortium community
that conducts many eDNA projects.
Preparation:
Candidates should have a PhD in biology or a related
science eld and molecular biology laboratory experi-
ence evidenced by a strong record of scholarship. The
ideal candidate would have demonstrated interest or
some experience working in science communication and
education research, as well as undergraduate teaching
or public outreach. Candidates should demonstrate
strong written and verbal communication skills, inter-
est in pedagogical innovation, educational assessment,
and scholarship, excellent organization and management
abilities, experience working with diverse groups. Can-
didates also should possess skills in mentorship. They
must be willing to travel within California, including
multiple trips per year between Santa Cruz and Los
Angeles, and lead eldwork excursions to collect eDNA
on UC Natural Reserves. Candidates must have a valid
driver' ^As license.

EvolutionaryQuantativeGenetics
A NERC-funded postdoctoral position is available in
evolutionary quantitative genetics, specically to inves-
tigate maternal eects in a wild mammal population,
with Josephine Pemberton, Craig Walling and Susan
Johnston at the University of Edinburgh.
Maternal eects are critical determinants of ospring
tness in animal populations, potentially as important
as heritable genetic variation or ecological conditions.
The study will involve analyses of (i) the genetic basis of
maternal eect variation and its interplay with other key
variables, (ii) new phenotypic measures to assess both
maternal and ospring condition and (iii) the impact of
maternal eects on the evolution of ospring traits.
The project will use the long-term study of individual
life histories of red deer living in the North Block on the
Isle of Rum, in which pilot analyses indicate maternal
eects are large. A pedigree of >4000 individuals is
available for study, and about 2,700 core individuals
have been genotyped on a 50K SNP array, enabling
genomic as well as genetic analyses.
Applicants should have (or nearly have) a PhD in evolu-
tionary biology and be familiar with quantitative genetic
concepts and analysis, ideally animal models. Experi-
ence in DNA extraction, genomic data management,
pedigree reconstruction and GWAS would also be ad-
vantageous. The postdoc will work within the Institute
of Evolutionary Biology, in the School of Biological Sci-
ences. The Institute houses multiple research groups in-
terested in evolutionary quantitative genetics and more
widely, Edinburgh has a large community of quantita-
tive geneticists working in biomedical research and on
animal improvement.

FloralColorEvolution
The Conservatory and Botanical Garden of Geneva
(CJBG) and the department of Botany and Plant Biol-
ogy from the University of Geneva is seeking an enthu-
siastic, independent postdoctoral researcher to work on
an SNF-funded project on the ecological and molecular
bases of ower color evolution.
The project aims to model the evolution of ower color
and integrate comparative analyses of molecular evolu-
tion, gene expression, and anthocyanins production in
a lineage of Neotropical plants, the Gesnerioideae. The
amazing ower diversity present in this plant group and
the frequent parallel evolution of bee, hummingbird and
bat pollination will provide the necessary framework
to identifying the role of pollinator- mediated selection
on ower color evolution and to better characterize the
biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying color
transitions. This project built on new transcriptomic
resources available for the group, which will facilitate
the identication of all genes involved in the antho-
cyanin biosynthetic pathway and their sequencing us-
ing target capture method. The CJBG/University of
Geneva is recruiting a postdoc to: 1) collect data on
oral reectance (in the eld and from cultivated plants)
and assess the level of convergence of ower colors and
their association with pollinator color vision; 2) iden-
tify the oral avonoids in a large sample of species
to determine the biochemical bases of ower color and
evolutionary constraints imposed by the biosynthetic
pathways; 3) characterize the anthocyanin genes using
NGS and quantitative PCR to analyze their evolution
in the Gesnerioidea radiation. This is a collaborative
project with the Computational Phylogenetics Group
of Prof. Nicolas Salamin at the University of Lausanne.
We seek a collegial, self-motivated, independent, and
intellectually curious individual. A PhD in evolution-
ary biology or related eld is required. Applicants for
this position must have strong bench skills and strong
familiarity with bioinformatic analyses of next-gen se-
quencing data and/or comparative analyses. In addition,
candidates must have demonstrated written and oral
communication skills. The position is available for 24

ULausanne EvolutionaryModeling
Postdoc positions in Evolutionary Modeling and Phylo-
genetics
**Job description**
A postdoctoral position is available in the group of Nico-
las Salamin in the Department of Computational Biology
of the University of Lausanne. The overall aim of the
project is to develop and improve current methods to
estimate the rates of evolution of continuous phenotypic
traits along phylogenetic trees.
Most of the developments of comparative methods have
targeted the evolution of species mean phenotypes,
whereas the treatment of intraspecic variability has
received less attention. The rst objective is to de-
velop a novel model testing framework to further under-
stand the evolution of the variance in phenotypic traits
within a macro-evolutionary framework and to extend
this estimation to multiple continuous traits. The sec-
ond objective is to model the evolution of phenotypic
traits across speciation events to better understand the
relationship between macro-evolutionary models and
micro-evolutionary processes.
**Prole requirements**
The ideal candidate should be an autonomous and ambi-
tious person with enthusiasm for inter-disciplinary work,
who will need to interact productively with evolutionary
biologists, genome biologists and computer scientists,
and read the corresponding range of scientic literature.
Candidates must have completed their PhD degrees orMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 123
equivalent in a relevant eld.
The requirements include a strong mathematical or sta-
tistical and computer science background and deep in-
terest in computational biology and theoretical aspects
of evolutionary biology. Previous experience with evo-
lutionary biology and/or computational biology is also
expected.
The successful candidates will be part of the Department
of Computational Biology of the University of Lausanne
as well as the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The
Department of Computational Biology of the University
of Lausanne oers a supportive and stimulating environ-
ment, with access to excellent computer and academic
facilities.

EvolutionGenomics
Title: UVienna.EvolutionGenomics
Dear Colleagues:
Applications are invited for one Ph.D. and one postdoc
position in the group of Qi Zhou in the Department
of Molecular Evolution and Development at University
of Vienna, Austria. Both are supported by the Euro-
pean Research Council (ERC) grant, and planned for
two years for postdoc, and three years for Ph.D. with
possible renewal. The successful applicants will use
bioinformatic and experimental methods to study the
evolution of Drosophila sex chromosomes. Most model
species' sex chromosomes, e.g., those of human and D.
melanogaster bear few traces of their evolution, because
they are too ancient and have become too repetitive
in sequence for investigation. A fundamental question
concerns evolution biologist is what are the causes andconsequences of Y chromosome degeneration? We will
be using Drosophila species with recently born sex chro-
mosome ('neo-sex') systems to address: How does the
Y chromosome become epigenetically inert? How does
this universal evolution process drive the adaptation
of small RNA defence systems? And how does such a
male-specic arms race between parasitic transposable
elements and small RNAs fuel the changes of the female
genome? The candidates are expected to be independent
and highly motivated. Essential qualications include
demonstrated experience either in Drosophila genetics
experiments (transgenics, CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis,
in situ hybridisation) or bioinformatic studies (RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq and corresponding data analyses).
Successful applicants will receive very competitive
salary and benets (https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-
funding/personnel-costs/), and enjoy the diverse and
vibrant research environment of the Department and the
University. The group members have frequent interac-
tions with other neighbour labs of Drosophila neurobiol-
ogy (Prof. Thomas Hummel) and developmental biology
(Prof. Ulrich Technau), and have a chance to develop
other collaborative research projects. The university
is located in the city centre of Vienna, which houses
numerous world's leading research institutes including
Gregor Mendel Institute, Institute of Molecular Biotech-
nology and Institute of Science and Technology etc. The
city now has gathered many great scientists in evolu-
tionary biology (http://www.univie.ac.at/evolvienna/-
?page id=6), RNA biology (http://www.mfpl.ac.at/rna-
biology/) and there is an encouraging plan to move
the biology departments of the University near other
institutes of Vienna Biocenter to form a new research
cluster. Vienna has been voted as the world's most
livable city for the eighth time, and is famous for its
history and culture, and now also a modern and in-
ternational lifestyle. Interested candidates please send
her/his CV and contact information of three referees
to Dr. Qi Zhou (qi.zhou@univie.ac.at). We will start
reviewing the application immediately until the position
is lled.

*Understanding the genetic architecture of complex
traits through SNP-based heritability analysis*
*Date:* Thursday 22nd March 2018, 9.30-3.30pm *Loca-
tion:* AIAS, Aarhus University, DENMARK *Tutor:*
Dr Doug Speed *Cost:* Free, but advance Registration
is REQUIRED
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aias-short-course-
methods-for-analysing-complex-trait-gwas-data-tickets-
43197420648 *Background:* In recent years there has
been great progress developing genome-wide statistical
tools for detecting causal variants, constructing
prediction models and better understanding the genetic
architecture of complex traits. However these tools
use regression models involving very large numbers
of predictors, and strong modelling assumptions are
required to tackle the consequent problem of over-tting.The results can be sensitive to these assumptions, and
also to the eects of population structure, genotyping
errors and the extent to which rare SNPs are included.
*Course outline:* I will cover mixed-model association
analysis (e.g., Fast-LMM, GEMMA), risk prediction
(e.g., polygenic risk scores, BLUP and MultiBLUP) and
heritability analyses (GCTA, LDAK, LDSC), both using
individual-level genetic data and summary statistics. I
will emphasise the common elements of these methods,
highlighting a standard framework that has emerged for
genome-wide SNP analysis, while also contrasting the
dierences in underlying modelling assumptions.
The practicals will provide step-by-step details for
analysing genetic data, starting either with individual-
level data (e.g., PLINK les or the output from IM-
PUTE2) or summary statistics (p-values from a GWAS).
There will be a selection of worked examples; to take
part in the practicals, participants should bring a laptop
with either MAC or LINUX OS
*Prerequisites:* Participants should have a basic under-
standing of statistics, and would ideally be familiar with130 EvolDir March 1, 2018

Barcelona IntroToBayesianInference
Jun11-15
Dear colleagues,
Transmitting Science is oering a new course: Introduc-
tion to Bayesian Inference in Practice, June 11th-15th,
2018, Barcelona (Spain).
Instructors:
Dr. Daniele Silvestro (University of Gothenburg, Swe-
den) and Tobias Hofmann (University of Gothenburg,
Sweden)
Course overview:
Bayesian methods have become standard practice in
several elds, (e.g. phylogenetic inference, evolution-
ary (paleo)biology, genomics), yet understanding how it
works is not always trivial.
The instructor will outline the relevant concepts and
basic theory, but the focus of the course will be to learn
how to do Bayesian inference in practice. He will show
how to implement the most common algorithms to esti-
mate parameters based on posterior probabilities, such
as Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers, and how tobuild hierarchical models.
The course will take a learn-by-doing approach, in which
participants will implement their own MCM Cs using
R or Python (templates for both languages will be pro-
vided).
After completion of the course, the participants will have
gained a better understanding of how the main Bayesian
methods implemented in many programs used in biolog-
ical research work. Participants will also learn how to
model at least basic problems using Bayesian statistics
and how to implement the necessary algorithms to solve
them.
Participants are encouraged to think of potential appli-
cations of Bayesian inference in their research, which
we will discuss and try to implement during the course.

Course overview
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians into the eld of comparative genomics. Dier-
ent techniques will be introduced to identify single nu-
cleotide polymorphism (SNP) and structural variations
(SVs) as well as the annotation of these variations andMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 131
the assessment for their functional impact.
Course format
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learn-
ing how to compare genomes and what can be learned
from genomic similarities as well as variations. It will
include information useful for both beginners and more
advanced users. We will start by introducing general
concepts of comparative genomics. On this basis, we
will then continue to describe all major analysis steps
from the raw sequencing data via the identication of
variations to an assessment of their impact on the phe-
notype.
Attendees should have a background in biology. There
will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practical ex-
ercises using command line Linux. We will therefore
dedicate one session to introduce basic and advanced
Linux concepts for processing data on Amazon cloud
(AWS). Attendees should have also some familiarity with
genomic data such as that arising from NGS sequencing
experiments.
LEARNING OUTCOMES

DeadlineExtended
Dear all, The registration deadline for the course \In-
troduction to Linux and workows for biologists" has
been extended to the 16th of February.
Website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course1/ )
Where: Berlin (Germany)
When: 12th-16th March 2018.
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
biologists, UK) ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
instructors/t1/ )
OverviewMost high-throughput bioinformatics work
these days takes place onthe Linux command line. The
programs which do the majority of thecomputational
heavy lifting genome assemblers, read mappers,and an-
notation tools are designed to work best when used
with acommand-line interface. Because the command
line can be an intimidatingenvironment, many biologists
learn the bare minimum needed to get theiranalysis
tools working. This means that they miss out on the
power ofLinux to customize their environment and au-
tomate many parts of thebioinformatics workow. This
course will introduce the Linux commandline environ-
ment from scratch and teach students how to make the
mostof its tools to achieve a high level of productivity
when working withbiological data.
Intended audienceThis course is aimed at researchers
and technical workers with abackground in biology who
want to learn to use the Linux operatingsystem and the
command line environment. No previous experience of
Linuxis required.

Course \Metabarcoding of microbial communities"
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course30/ When: 16th-20th April 2018
Where: Botanisches Museum, K onigin-Luise-Strae 6-8,
Berlin (Germany)
Instructors:
Dr. Anna Sandionigi (University of Milan Bicocca,
Italy)
Dr. Bruno Fosso (Institute of Biomem-
brane,Bioenergetics and Molecular Biotechnologies,
CNR, Italy)
Overview
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
application of metabarcoding techniques in microbial
ecology. The topics covered by the course range from
bioinformatic processing of next-generation sequencing
data to the most important approaches in multivariate
statistics. Using a combination of theoretical lectures
and hands-on exercises, the participants will learn the
most important computational steps of a metabarcoding
study from the processing of raw sequencing reads down
to the nal statistical evaluations. After completingMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 133
the course, the participants should be able to under-
stand the potential and limitations of metabarcoding
techniques as well as to process their own datasets to
answer the questions under investigation.
Format
This course is designed for researchers and students with
strong interests in applying novel high-throughput DNA
sequencing technologies to answer questions in the area
of community ecology and biodiversity. The course will
mainly focus on the analysis of phylogenetic markers
to study bacterial, archaeal and fungal assemblages in
the environment, but the theoretical concepts and com-
putational procedures can be equally applied to any
taxonomic group or gene of interest.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background
in biology and understand the central role of DNA for
biodiversity studies. No programming or scripting ex-
pertise is required and some basic introduction to UNIX-
based command line applications will be provided on
the rst day. However, some basic experience with using
command line and/or R is clearly an advantage as not
all the basics can be thoroughly covered in that short
amount of time. All hands-on exercises will be run in
UNIX-environments (Linux, Mac) on remote servers.
Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStudio.
Learning Outcomes
1) Understanding the concept, potential and limitation
of microbial metabarcoding techniques.
2) Learning how to process raw sequencing reads to
obtain meaningful information.
3) Obtaining experience on how to statistically evaluate
and visualize your data.
4) Being able to make informed decisions on best prac-
tices for your own data.

Berlin RStatistics Jun18-22
Getting started with R [ https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course13/ ) 18-22 June
2018, Berlin (Germany) Application deadline is: May
20th, 2018.
Instructor: Dr. Alexandre Courtiol (Leibniz Institute for
Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin (Germany)) https://-
www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t40/ ) Overview:
R is the statistical software the most used in the world.
It is extremely powerful, free of charge and open source.
Despite these benets, many avoid R, or struggle with
it, as writing computer code to do any operation { a
requirement in R { is at rst both dicult and intimi-dating.
This course aims at overcoming those challenges by
providing solid basics in R. At the end of the course,
participants should feel much more at ease writing a
computer script in the R language which covers the
entire spectrum of a statistical analysis: reading data,
editing them, plotting them, and analysing them. Be-
cause linear models are the dominant statistical tool in
many elds, the part of the course focussing on analyses
per se (see schedule) will focus on those, but principles
seen during the class should greatly help those inter-
ested in other kind of analyses as well. The course will
be presented over ve days and will mix explanations
and guided exercises. Students are free to practice with
their own datasets during the course.
Intended Audience & Assumed Background: This course
is aimed at scientists from quantitative sciences (e.g. bi-
ology, epidemiology, psychology...). It has been created
with biologists in mind but it should accommodate sci-
entists from other disciplines. No previous experience
with R is required. Participants should have a basic
familiarity with statistical terms and concepts.
Session content Monday 18th 'V Classes from 09:30
to 17:30 Monday is DATA day This rst day will be
dedicated to the data. R is software dedicated to data
analysis, so mastering the basics of data manipulation in
R is essential for further steps. It will be explained how
to import data into R and how to manipulate them (e.g.
from adding or removing rows or columns, to merging
tables and using pivot tables). This will be good prac-
tice for students to learn the basics of the R language.
We will illustrate how to do everything using R base
(that is R out of the box), but we will also introduce
that allow users to perform some operations on large
datasets a little faster.
Tuesday 19th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Tuesday is
PLOTTING day Plotting is a crucial part of any data
analysis no matter how advanced you are in statistics.
It is important to visualise the data before the analysis
(e.g. to visually check the presence of potential errors
and for getting a sense of the distribution of the data),
during the analysis (e.g. to check the distribution of
model residuals), and after the analysis (to communicate
ndings in the most ecient way). Therefore, knowing
how to plot various kind of data matters a lot. We
will thus show how to plot dierent types of data in R
(points, distributions, rasters...) using dierent graphic
environments (e.g graphics, lattice, ggplot2).
Wednesday 20th 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Wednes-
day is FUNCTIONS day As John Chambers { the grand-
father of R { put it Everything that happens in R is
a function call. That R allows for so-called functional136 EvolDir March 1, 2018
programming is one of its great benets: it allows the
implementation of any workow of statistical analysis
as the succession of simple clearly identied steps. Each
step is described by a function that takes an input and
generates an output. The output of one function is often
the input of the next. On this third day we will show
that creating one's own function is very very easy (yes,
even YOU can program!) and can be very very useful.
As a rst application we will create our own functions
to implement a randomisation test. As a second appli-
cation we will show how to create functions to perform
a power analysis (the estimation of the probability of
getting true positives when applying a test) for any
statistical test.
Thursday 21st 'V Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Thursday
is LM day Many widely used statistical methods (t-tests,
anova, ancova, linear regressions...) are just dierent
type of Linear Models (LM), which is why LM represent
the most useful statistical toolbox to be familiar with if
you are in natural or social sciences. Fitting a LM in R
is easy { but building models, checking model assump-
tions, interpreting the outputs, and plotting predictions
correctly requires some know how. After refreshing the
most important concepts surrounding LM, we will go
through each of these steps in detail, working on real
datasets. It is important to understand LM quite well
before jumping into the more complex methods which
we will see on the next day.

University from June 3 to June 9, 2018, organized by
the Triangle Center for Evolutionary Medicine (TriCEM,
http://www.tricem.org/). We also encourage applica-
tions from advanced undergraduates interested in evolu-
tionary medicine, and graduate students in organismal
biology who wish to apply an evolutionary perspective
to human or animal health.
Evolution is largely absent from medical and public
health training, yet it is vital to tackling our most ur-
gent health challenges, including emerging infectious
diseases, the evolution of microbial resistance, increas-
ing prevalence of autoimmune diseases, the obesity epi-
demic, threats to food safety, neurodegenerative disease,
and cancer.
The goal of EMSI is to introduce core evolutionary per-
spectives to a wide range of topics in human health
and disease, and to train physicians and medical scien-
tists in computational methods used in evolutionary and
ecological research. EMSI will bring together interna-
tionally recognized experts in evolutionary biology with
students and health practitioners who want to apply
these perspectives rigorously to cancer, infectious dis-
ease, antibiotic resistance, brain sciences, autoimmune
disease, the microbiome, and more. Mornings will fea-
ture lectures to instill a foundational understanding of
core concepts in evolutionary medicine and evolutionary
biology. In the afternoons, we will break into subgroups
for training on specic evolutionary methods, including
phylogenetics, molecular evolution, the microbiome, and
epidemiology.
EMSI will also oer an opportunity for scientists and
practitioners across disciplines to network and build
collaborations. To facilitate networking, interested par-
ticipants will form teams to write short papers that
present evolutionary perspectives on specic diseases,
which will be submitted as Clinical Briefs to the jour-
nal Evolution, Medicine and Public Health (http://-
emph.oxfordjournals.org/).138 EvolDir March 1, 2018
Applications are due by March 1, 2018. For more infor-
mation, and to submit an application, please go to the

Greifswald GreifOlution
MathematicsOfEvolution Sep16-22
Dear EvolDir users,
As part of the \Year of Mathematical Biology" we
proudly announce GreifOlution, the 1st Greifswald Sum-
mer School on Mathematics of Evolution (kindly funded
by the DAAD, the German Academic Exchange Ser-
vice). The main focus of this summer school will be
on mathematical models and methods for reconstruct-
ing phylogenetic trees and networks, but upon request
we might also include some sessions on other related
topics, e.g. from population genetics. | So if you are
a mathematician or computer scientist with a strong
interest in biology or a biologist who aspires to a deeper
understanding of mathematical or statistical methods
and| models, this summer school is what you need! |
Greifswald University is one of the hotspots of mathe-
matical phylogenetics and biomathematics in Germany
- as the only German university which has been oering
a biomathematics study program already for 20 years,
the small town located directly at the Baltic Sea has
attracted lots of renowned researchers over the years! So
why not benet from the presence of all these experts?
Come and spend a week in summer at the beautiful
Baltic Sea and deepen your knowledge on mathematical
phylogenetics!
This summer school aims at bridging the gap between
mathematics and biology and providing both a broad
introduction to various elds of biomathematics (e.g.biostatistics, bioinformatics and mathematical phyloge-
netics) as well as insights into state-of-the-art research.
| We invite applications from PhD students, PostDocs
and advanced graduate students of Mathematics, Com-
puter Science or Biology (and related areas of study)
who have a great interest in Biomathematics, in partic-
ular in Mathematical Phylogenetics. The school is free
of charge. There are also no costs for the social dinner,
the excursions and lunch during the summer school, but
participants must cover their own accomodation and
travel expenses. Foreign participants, however, may
be eligible for funding (see the below for the DAAD
reglementation concerning foreign participants).

De novo assembly of transcriptomes using HPC re-
sources workshop
Hosted by The National Center for Genome Analysis
Support at Indiana University
The National Center for Genome Analysis Support, or
NCGAS, at Indiana University is oering a National
Science Foundation-sponsored, two-day workshop on
high performance computing usage and de novo tran-
scriptome assembly. It will take place April 30-May 1
on the IU Bloomington campus.
The workshop will include discussions, lectures, and
hands-on tutorials to cover topics important to getting
started constructing and analyzing transcriptomes^ a euro
\without the use of a genome. Material will cover both
the availability and use of high performance computing
(HPC) resources, alongside the task of assembling a new
transcriptome, in order to provide a more comprehensive
preparation for this and future bioinformatic tasks.
Transcriptome assembly will consist of using four sepa-
rate assemblers (Trinity, SOAP de novo, Velvet Oases,
and TransABySS), with multiple kmers, to be com-
bined and curated with Evigenes. This combined as-
sembly with multiple parameters is considered muchmore robust than simply using one assembler, and the
NCGAS pipeline streamlines the process and allows for
customization if desired.
While material will make heavy use of XSEDE and IU
machines, the material is transferable to any cluster.

MolecularEvolution Jul19-29
Founded in 1988, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution
is the longest-running workshop if its kind. The 2018
workshop will be held July 19-29, and this will be its
30th anniversary at the Marine Biological Lab in Woods
Hole, MA. The Workshop is the premier program for
integrating the methods, theory, and applications of
molecular phylogenetics, statistical genetics, molecular
evolution, and related disciplines. Students work closely
with internationally-recognized scientists, receiving (i)
high-level instruction in the principles of molecular evo-
lution and evolutionary genomics, (ii) advanced training
in statistical methods best suited to modern datasets,
and (iii) hands-on experience with the latest software
tools (often from the authors of the programs they are
using). The material is delivered via lectures, discus-
sions, and bioinformatic exercises motivated by contem-
porary topics in molecular evolution. A hallmark of this
workshop is the direct interaction between students and
eld-leading scientists. The workshop serves graduate
students, postdocs, and established faculty from around
the world seeking to apply the principles of molecular
evolution to questions of both basic and applied biologi-
cal sciences. A priority of this workshop is to foster an
environment where students can learn from each other
as well from the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to use
the following software to address questions concern-
ing the origins, maintenance, and function of molec-
ular variation: ASTRAL, BEAST2, BEST, FASTA,
FigTree, GARLI, IQTree, MIGRATE, MAFFT, MP-
EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML, PAUP*, SNaQ, and
SVD Quartets. Students will have the opportunity to
work with software on their own laptops as well as re-
ceive training on how to use the same programs on a
high performance computer cluster.

DESCRIPTION:
Study methods in population genomics have been pro-
foundly reshaped in the last few years thanks to thegrowing availability of complete genomic sequences at
population level. The rapid and recent growth of data
and methods calls for new approaches to become routine
in evolutionary genomics laboratories. The objective of
this Practical Course is to give an overview of state of the
art methods in population genomics combining lectur-
ing from outstanding experienced population geneticists
and software developers. All conceptual innovation will
be presented in lectures and applied in practice both
individually and in group work.
Practicals include computer exercises supervised by
lecturers and training assistants. After attending the
course participants will be aware of up-to-date concepts
in population genetics, capable of running analyses using
software based on whole genome data sequences and able
to deal with basic aspects of any population genomics
project. This Practical Course aims at evolutionary
biologists who already have bioinformatics skills. PhD
students and Post-Doc researchers will benet the most
out of this course, but applications from all candidates
will be evaluated in their context.

ObergeriSwitzerland BEAST
Jun17-22
Dear colleagues,
We are happy to announce that registration is now open
for our summer school \Taming the BEAST".
Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in
modern biology. Phylogenetic inferences reconstruct the
evolutionary relationships between organisms, whereas
phylodynamic inferences reveal the dynamics that lead
to the observed relationships. These two elds have
many practical applications in disciplines such as epi-
demiology, developmental biology, paleontology, ecologyand even linguistics. However, phylogenetics and phylo-
dynamics are complex and fast-evolving elds. As such,
inference tools are not easily accessible to researchers
who are not from a computational background.
Taming the BEAST is a summer school focusing on the
BEAST2 software and consisting of a mix of invited
talks, lectures and hands-on tutorials by leading and
renowned experts in the eld (including several of the
core developers of BEAST2). The aim of this summer
school is to equip participants with the skills necessary
to condently perform their own phylogenetic and phylo-
dynamic inferences in Bayesian settings, while providing
them with a rm grasp of the theory behind those in-
ferences. Participants are also highly encouraged to
bring their own datasets along and to engage with the
organizers and speakers to address any problems specic
to their own datasets/analyses.
REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN. We welcome applica-
tions from graduate students and early-career scientists
in the life sciences. Preference will be given to appli-
cants who are not from a computational background
and applicants who have already collected/assembled a
dataset that they need to analyze.

Mar11-16
PhD course on Life History Theory, Field station the
Herdershut, Schiermonnikoog, March 11-16 2018
Life History Theory deals with species-specic adaptive
schemes of the distribution of the reproductive eort
over the life of an organism. The general theoretical
problem is to predict which combination of traits will
evolve under specic conditions. The concepts used are
also relevant to study within species variation in life
history traits. The one week course aims at giving an
overview of the eld and will discuss methodology and
recent developments.
Contents & Structure
The subject will be worked out on the basis of lectures,
case histories, discussion and literature. Attention will
be paid to various groups of organisms such as birds,
shes, insects and plants. The contact with current
research projects is guaranteed as concrete examples
will be treated by scientists working in the eld. In
poster sessions work and/or plans of the participating
students will be discussed with the whole group and we
will use computers to illustrate some of the concepts.
Topics and Teachers:
Cost of reproduction and aging in a life history context
(Simon Verhulst, GELIFES)
Life-history variation and population dynamics (Martijnvan de Pol, NIOO)
Evolutionary genomics, Animal personalities (Kees van
Oers, NIOO)
Age and size at maturity (Tom van Dooren, CNRS,
France)
We are very happy to announce that this year we will
have two special guest lecturers: Jonathan Wright and
Yimen Araya Ajoy (both of the Norwegian University of
Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway). Professor
Wright is a behavioural ecologist who is an expert on the
evolution of cooperation, parental care, parent-ospring
conict, cooperative breeding in birds. Dr Araya-Ajoy is
particularly interested in the causes of variation in labile
traits and its consequences on population dynamics.

This course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an
expert in Python and author of two text books,

Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable lan-
guage that is a popular platform for all types of bioin-
formatics work, from simple one-o scripts to large,
complex software projects. This workshop is aimed at
people who already have a basic knowledge of Python
and are interested in using the language to tackle larger
problems. In it, we will look in detail at the parts of
the language which are particularly useful in scientic
programming, and at the tools Python oers for mak-
ing development faster and easier. The course will use
examples and exercises drawn from various aspects of
bioinformatics work. After completing the workshop,
students should be in a position to (1) take advantage of
the advanced language features in their own programs
and (2) use appropriate tools when developing software
programs.
Monday 28th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 Module 1:
Data structures in Python.
In this session we will briey recap Python's basic data
structures, before looking at a couple of new data types
{ tuples and sets { and discussing where each should
be used. We will then see how we can combine these
basic types to make more complex data structures for
solving specic problems. We'll nish our discussion
by looking at specialized data types that are found in
the Python core library. This session will also be our
rst introduction to benchmarking as we talk about
the relative performance of dierent data types. In the
practical session we'll learn how to parse an input le
into a complex data structure which we can then useto rapidly query the data. Core concepts introduced:
tuples, sets, higher-order data structures, default dicts,
Counters, big-O notation.
Module 2: Recursion and trees. In this session we will
cover two very closely related concepts: trees (i.e. the
various ways that we can store hierarchical data) and
recursive functions (the best way to operate on treelike
data). As recursion is inherently confusing, we'll start
with a gentle introduction using biological examples
before moving on to consider a number of core tree
algorithms concerning parents, children, and common
ancestors. In the practical session we'll look in detail
at one particular way of identifying the last common
ancestor of a group of nodes, which will give us an op-
portunity to explore the role of recursion. Core concepts
introduced: nested lists, storing hierarchical data, re-
cursive functions, relationship between recursion and
iteration.
Tuesday 7th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Module 3: Classes and objects. In this session we will
introduce the core concepts of object-oriented program-
ming, and see how the data types that we use all the time
in Python are actually examples of classes. We'll take a
very simple example and use it to examine how we can
construct our own classes, moving from an imperative
style of programming to an object-oriented style. As we
do so, we'll discuss where and when object-orientation
is a good idea. In the practical we will practise writing
classes to solve simple biological problems and famil-
iarize ourselves with the division of code into library
and client that object-oriented programming demands.
Core concepts introduced: classes, instances, methods
vs. functions, self, constructors, magic methods.
Module 4: Object-oriented programming. Following
on from the previous session, we will go over some ad-
vanced ideas that are common to most object-oriented
programming languages. For each idea we'll discuss the
basic concept, the scenarios in which it's useful, and
the details of how it works in Python. This overview
will also allow us to consider the challenges involved
in designing object-oriented code. In the practical we
will work on a simulation which will involve multiple
classes working together. Core concepts introduced:
inheritance and class hierarchies, method overriding, su-
perclasses and subclasses, polymorphism, composition,
multiple inheritance.
Wednesday 29th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00
Module 5: Functional programming in Python. This
session will start with a look at a few dierent con-
cepts that are important in functional programming,
culminating in a discussion of the idea of148 EvolDir March 1, 2018

PS statistics are running a course aimed specically at
analysing behavioural data and is therefor highly rele-
vant to those studying the evolution of behaviour (both
human and animal)
\Behavioural data analysis using maximum likelihood in
R (BDML01)"
https://www.psstatistics.com/course/behavioural-data-
analysis-using-maximum-likelihood-bdml01/ This
course is being devilled by Dr Will Hoppitt and will
run from 19th - 23rd March 2018 in Glasgow
Course Overview: This 5-day course will involve a com-
bination of lectures and practical sessions. Students
will learn to build and t custom models for analysing
behavioural data using maximum likelihood techniques
in R. This exible approach allows a researcher to a) use
a statistical model that directly represents their hypoth-
esis, in cases where standard models are not appropriate
and b) better understand how standard statistical mod-
els (e.g. GLMs) are tted, many of which are tted
by maximum likelihood. Students will learn how to
deal with binary, count and continuous data, including
time-to-event data which is commonly encountered in
behavioural analysis.
1) After successfully completing this course students
should be able to: 2) t a multi-parameter maximum
likelihood model in R 3) derive likelihood functions for
binary, count and continuous data 4) deal with time-
to-event data 5) build custom models to test specic
behavioural hypotheses 6) conduct hypothesis tests and
construct condence intervals 7) use Akaike's informa-
tion criterion (AIC) and model averaging 8) understand
how maximum likelihood relates to Bayesian techniques

This course will run from 21st - 25th May 2018 in
Glasgow and is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones,
an expert in Python and author of two text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/-
dp/1492346136/] Advanced Python for Biologists
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/] . Course overview:
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a
popular platform for all types of bioinformatics work,
from simple one-o scripts to large, complex software
projects. This workshop is aimed at complete beginners
and assumes no prior programming experience. It
gives an overview of the language with an emphasis on
practical problem-solving, using examples and exercises
drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics work.
After completing the workshop, students should be in
a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to
tackle problems in their own research and (2) continue
their Python education in a self-directed way.
Intended audience: This workshop is aimed at all re-
searchers and technical workers with a background in
biology who want to learn programming. The syllabus
has been planned with complete beginners in mind; peo-
ple with previous programming experience are welcome
to attend as a refresher but may nd the pace a bit
slow.
Teaching format: The workshop is delivered over ten
half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organizer's discretion. There will also be plentyof time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum:
Monday 21st Module 1: Introduction. We will start
with a general introduction to Python and explain why
it is useful and how learning to program can benet
your research. Some time will be taken to explain the
format of the course. We will outline the edit-run-x
cycle of software development and talk about how to
avoid common text editing errors. In this session, we
also check that the computing infrastructure for the rest
of the course is in place.^ a eCore concepts introduced:
source code; text editors; whitespace; syntax and syntax
error; and Python versions.
Module 2: Output and text manipulation. This session
will show students how to write very simple programs
that produce output to the terminal and in doing so be-
come comfortable with editing and running Python code.
This session also introduces many of the technical terms
that we'll rely on in future sessions. We will run through
some examples of tools for working with text and show
how they work in the context of biological sequence
manipulation. We also cover dierent types of errors
and error messages and learn how to go about xing
them methodically.^ a eCore concepts introduced: termi-
nals; standard output; variables and naming;^ a estrings
and characters; special characters; output formatting;
statements; functions; methods; arguments; comments.
Tuesday 22nd
Module 3: File IO and user interfaces. We will discuss
about the importance of les in bioinformatics pipelines
and workows during this session, and we then explore
the Python interfaces for reading from and writing to
les. This involves introducing the idea of types and ob-
jects and a bit of discussion about how Python interacts
with the operating system. The practical session is spent
combining the techniques from session 2 with the le
IO tools to create basic le-processing scripts.^ a eCore
concepts introduced: objects and classes; paths and

\Introduction to remote sensing and GIS for ecological
applications (IRMS01)"
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-remote-sensing-and -gis-for-ecological-applications-
irms01/
This course will be delivered from the 21st - 25th May
2018 by Prof. Duccio Rocchini and Dr. Luca Delucchi
in Glasgow City Centre.
This course is aimed at anyone using remote sense (RS)
data, for example those in the eld of landscape genet-
ics/genomics and will give a full overview of RS from
an introductory level using R and Python
Course Overview:
The course will deal with dierent aspects related to
the use of remote sensing and GIS in spatial ecology
by using the Free and Open Source Software GRASS
GIS coupled with R. By the end of this 5-day practical
course, attendees will have the capacity to deal with
ecological patterns and processes by using GIS and re-
mote sensing algorithms. The increasing availability of
open ecological and geographical data through networks
such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF, http://www.gbif.org) or the Data Observation
Network for Earth (DataONE) federated data archive
(http://www.dataone.org) makes it increasingly possi-
ble to test cutting-edge ecological theories. In using
a shared open-source code for testing these ecological
theories, researchers can be sure that their results are
reliable and also that the code they have used is robust.
Attendees will be able to process spatial and ecological
data by free and open source algorithms. The coursewill be mainly practical, but grounded on robust theory.
All the analyses will be performed in GRASS GIS and
the code will be shared with attendees.

UNebraska EvolutionImmunity
\Immunity Across Scales" workshop
Location/Date: Glasgow, Scotland, May 28-29, 2018
with an opening dinner on May 27.
Leader: Clay Cressler, University of Nebraska
To apply: Submit your CV and a cover letter (1 page
maximum) describing your interest in participating in
this workshop. Please note that we are especially in-
terested in contributions from researchers working on
any aspect of immunity, from traditional mechanistic
immunology, to wild immunology, to comparative im-
munology, and mathematicians working on developing
models of the immune-parasite interaction. Please sub-
mit your application to: ccressler2@unl.edu by 31 March
2018.** Accepted applicants will receive funding for trans-
portation to/from Glasgow, accommodation and meals
during the workshop, and the EEID conference regis-
tration fee. We strongly recommend early registration
for EEID, as registration is capped. All costs will be
reimbursed after the workshop and meeting.**
The immune response is perhaps the primary arbiter of a
host's interaction with its parasites and pathogens, and
its costs and benets strongly inuence the tness of the
host. It is well-established that the immune response
is inuenced by both the host's external environment
(e.g., host diet, social interactions) and by its internal
environment (e.g., interactions with other metabolic
pathways, coinfection). At both scales, the environ-
ment creates trade-os between immunity and aspects
of organismal life history and physiology. The goal of
this workshop is to bring together behavioral ecologists,
disease ecologists, immunologists, and mathematical bi-
ologists to understand the emergence and implications
of these trade-os for ecological interactions, epidemio-
logical dynamics, and, ultimately, the coevolution of the
immune system with diverse parasites and pathogens.
Researchers with relevant datasets, mathematical mod-
els, or statistical tools will give short talks and work in
breakout sessions organized around focal questions gen-
erated by workshop participants, working to integrate
the insights from ecological and mechanistic immunology
and develop general mathematical and statistical mod-
els. Additionally, several workshop attendees will give
talks during the EEID session, \Within-host dynamics:
co-infection to wild immunity."

UppsalaU AnalysingGenderedAs-
sumptionsInEvolutionaryBiology
Apr12-13
Dear EvolDir users,
We would like to invite you to the workshop Analysing
Gendered Assumptions In Evolutionary Biology (https:/-
/genderedassumptions.xyz/), funded by ESEB's Equal
Opportunity initiative. It will take place at Uppsala
University on April 12-13. Description below:
In evolutionary biology research, we often approach ques-
tions on males and females dierently. Sometimes thereMarch 1, 2018 EvolDir 153
may be good reasons for this. However, it may also be an
outcome of gender biased assumptions. For instance, in
evolutionary biology we commonly study sex dierences
and how these result from natural selection. We study
this from both genetic and environmental perspectives.
We may, however, often times assume that males and fe-
males have xed trait abilities determined by their past
evolutionary history, despite the fact that evolution is
an ongoing process. Emanating from what is considered
well known patterns, our assumptions may turn out to
be biased by our expectations of gender. Examples from
this can be found in sexual selection research where we
increasingly nd diversity in how this force operates on
males and females, which can be contrasted with more
simplistic views that \males compete and females care"
as an evolutionary rule (in this context, it should be
noted that the Bateman gradient paradigm has been
under debate for quite some time). Furthermore, in med-
ical and scientic textbooks, gendered assumptions have
been identied and analyzed. For example, gendered
views are apparent in textbooks when depicting egg,
sperm, cervix, mucus, and semen, with active wordings
for the male part and passive, objectied words for the
female part despite the fact that, scientically, we know
mucus activity is a vital part of the fertilization process.
Similar gendered biases have also been found in sexual
conict studies. And when plasticity is found in male
and female traits, there is a tendency to stick to rm sex
dierences despite contrary evidence - as, for example,
in neuroscience. More recently we have seen in the news
how, after DNA testing was conducted, the remains of a
Viking leader were found to be those of a woman. This
had been indicated previously but was not considered
likely, probably due to pervasive gender biases. This
provides an illustrative case of how researchers' gender
biased assumptions can aect scientic knowledge.
In this two day workshop we aim to identify and discuss
such gender biased assumptions in scientic publica-
tions, as a gateway to more deeply analyze the way
we make inferences in our scientic reasoning. Further-
more, we aim to constructively put forward guidelines
on how we, as scientists and members of the general pub-
lic, should handle gendered assumptions. We therefore
hope, through this workshop, to address some important
gaps in evolutionary biology research.
The workshop will take place at the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Center of Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, on
12-13 of April 2018.
To participate, send an e-mail to In-
grid.Ahnesjo@ebc.uu.se before the 15th of March
2018 and provide a short motivation letter (150
words). Number of participants is limited to 25.
Participants will have to arrange travel and hous-ing themselves (for cheap accommodation, check
https://www.hostelworld.com/).
Participants can apply for the ESEB congress atten-
dance aid grants (http://eseb.org/prizes-funding/equal-
opportunities-initiative/congress-attendance-aid-grant/)
before 16 February 2018.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.March 1, 2018 EvolDir 155
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
