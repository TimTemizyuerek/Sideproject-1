GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCE IN GENES
AND BEHAVIOR
Announcing the ﬁrst Gordon Research Conference in
“Genes and Behavior.” The goal of this meeting is
to foster a broad approach to this topic by bringing
together scientists that use model genetic systems to
study behavior with scientists that use model behav-
ioral systems to study behavior. The conference series
seeks to help foster a synthesis that involves molecu-
lar biology, neuroscience, behavior, ecology and evolu-
tionary biology; lab and ﬁeld studies; and both mech-
anistic and evolutionary perspectives. Sessions for the
ﬁrst conference will be devoted to the following top-
ics: social structure; foraging and ingestive behavior;
sensory systems and communication; behavior analysis
in model genetic systems; nature/nurture; theoretical
approaches to genes & behavior; and reproductive be-
havior.
The GRC will be from February 8 - 13, 2004 in Ventura,
California. The Chairperson is Gene Robinson, the
Vice Chairperson is Robert Hitzeman, and the mem-
bers of the Program Committee are Christine Boake,4 EvolDir November 1, 2003
Felix Breden, and Allen Moore.
WHY SHOULD I ATTEND?
The GRCs are wonderful and stimulating because they
are organized to be free-wheeling and spirited events
with built-in time for lots of audience participation. Ev-
eryone is encouraged to participate and to speak with
abandon about his or her wildest ideas.
The meetings are structured with sessions in the morn-
ing and evenings; afternoons are left open so people can
chat, relax, or see the sights.
WHAT IS THE PROGRAM?
The complete program is listed on the Gordon Confer-
ences web site, http://www.grc.org/ .
WHAT IS THE COST OF THE MEETING?
The meeting registration is $800 (actually $750 if you
register up until 3 weeks before the meeting) (plus your
airfare). This includes all expenses at the meeting such
as lodging and food. For details, see Gordon Confer-
ences web site.
We hope to be able to defray some travel or meet-
ing costs for participants from targeted groups (gradu-
ate students, postdocs, minorities, attendees from third
world countries) although we cannot make any com-
mitments at this time. Please contact Gene Robinson
(generobi@life.uiuc.edu).
HOW DO I APPLY?
We will have a maximum capacity of 135 participants
of which 55 are speakers or discussants for the sessions.
That means that about 80 slots are open for other at-
tendees. We will select attendees to promote diversity
in participants (gender, ethnicity, geographical region,
level of degree, research interests). But within these
categories we will also accept participants on a ﬁrst
come ﬁrst serve basis. So if you are interested, APPLY
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

Population Genetics and related disciplines. This meet-
ing is focused on selection processes and on the geo-
graphic analysis of genetic variation.November 1, 2003 EvolDir 5
In the last years, substantial theoretical and experi-
mental progress has been done regarding the diﬀerent
forces shaping the patterns of variability in the hu-
man genome. In particular, distinguishing the eﬀects
of demography and natural selection remains one the
hottest issues among human populations geneticists,
demographers and statistical geneticists. There is an
urgent need of a public debate on such areas of inves-
tigation; their methodological aspects should be dis-
cussed in a wide frame that only a symposium can of-
fer. Even though the scientiﬁc interests of many speak-
ers are directed towards the understanding of human
diversity and the diﬀerent forces shaping it, this sym-
posium is also addressed to all scholars interested in
the methodological aspects concerning genetic diversity
and consequently, it may be of great interest for Animal
and Plant Population Geneticists, Ecologists, Demogra-
phers, GIS, etc. To address an international audience,
the oﬃcial language of this event will be English
A CALL FOR ABSTRACTS IS OPEN, and we will be
happy to accept up to 7 oral presentations and about 20
posters.We remind that the symposium is focused onS-
ELECTION PROCESSES and on the GEOGRAPHIC
ANALYSIS OF GENETIC VARIATION. All abstracts
not concerning these areas of investigation are discour-
aged.
DEADLINES: Abstract submission: Nov., 3 (notiﬁca-
tion of acceptance or rejection before Nov., 14) Regis-
tration : Nov, 15 (after this date fees will be increased
of 50%).

Valencia MEEGID Jul19-23 2
08/10/03
The 7th International Meeting “Molecular Epidemi-
ology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Dis-
eases” (MEEGID VII) will be held in Valencia ( http:/-
/www.valencia-on-line.com/ ), Spain, 19th-23rd July
2004. As for the 6 ﬁrst MEEGID meetings, it will be co-
organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/ ) in Atlanta, the
Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS;
http://www.cnrs.fr/ ) and the Institut de Recherche
pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD; http://www.ird.fr/ ) in
France.
MEEGID VII will be hosted by the 9th European
Multicolloquium of Parasitology (EMOP IX; http://-
www.uv.es/emop9/ ). Many sessions will be organized
in common by the 2 meetings. EMOP IX is expected to
attract 2000-4000 participants. Communications done
in the framework of MEEGID VII will therefore have
much impact. EMOP IX is organized by Professor San-
tiago Mas Coma, professor of parasitology at the uni-
versity of Valencia, receiving editor of Infection, Genet-ics and Evolution (Elsevier) for Spain, and co-organizer
of MEEGID VII (S.Mas.Coma@uv.es)
Proposals are accepted for: (1) Posters; (2)
Oral communications; (3) Organizations of roundta-
bles/symposia (2 hours, 4-6 speakers); (4) Express de-
bates (1 hour, only one speaker with a communica-
tion of 15-20 mn followed by free discussion); (4) Ple-
nary lectures (45 mn). Proposals dealing with roundta-
bles/symposia, express debates and plenary lectures
should be submitted as soon as possible.
MEEGID is not restricted to evolution only. The
scopes proposed can deal with genetics, genomics, pro-
teomics, population biology, mathematical modelling,
bioinformatics, molecular epidemiology, molecular di-
agnosis and morphometrical identiﬁcation. They can
consider the host, the pathogen or the vector. Papers
considering host + pathogen or pathogen + vector (co-
evolution) are particularly encouraged. All pathogens
are within the scope of MEEGID: viruses, parasitic
protozoa, helminths, fungal organisms, prion. All in-
fectious models can be considered, including those of
veterinary or agronomical relevance. As for the for-
mer MEEGID congresses, special consideration will be
given to communications of high relevance for develop-
ing countries.
The papers communicated for MEEGID VII will be
published in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and
Evolution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002). Infection, Genetics and Evolution is now covered
by Medline and Index Medicus, since the 1st issue of the
journal.
Awards will be attributed to the best communication,
the best communication by a student and the best com-
munication by a scientist from the Southern World on
a problem speciﬁcally relevant to these areas.
Limited funds will be made available to travel students
and scientists from developing countries.
Hope to see you in Valencia,
Have a very pleasant day.

The PRogram for Interdisciplinary Mathematics, Ecol-
ogy, and Statistics (PRIMES) is a new graduate initia-
tive in quantitative ecology at Colorado State Univer-
sity funded by an IGERT grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation. PRIMES involves leading faculty and
researchers from across the Colorado State University
campus, as well as scientists from a variety of govern-
ment agencies and laboratories. The goal of PRIMES is
to equip graduate students interested in ecology, math-
ematics, and statistics with the skills to tackle mod-
ern ecological research problems using an interdisci-
plinary team-based approach. PRIMES students enroll
in a home graduate program at Colorado State Univer-
sity. But, they participate in interdisciplinary research
right from the start of their studies while obtaining the
necessary research tools through an exciting program
of innovative course work, seminars, conferences and
workshops, internships, and social events. PRIMES
awards both full year and partial year support to par-
ticipating students. The full year Fellowship stipend
for 2003/2004 is $27,500 plus tuition. Applications are
invited by new and continuing students; see the website
http://www.primes.colostate.edu for further details.

CornellU EvolEcol
Graduate Research Associate at Cornell University
with Stephen Ellner and Nelson G. Hairston, Jr.
We invite applications from prospective doctoral stu-
dents to join our research project “The evolutionary
ecology of population dynamics: experimental and
modeling approaches”. Some recent papers from this
project are listed below. Interested students should
contact us directly and apply for Fall 2004 admission
to Cornell through the graduate ﬁelds of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology, or Applied Mathematics.
Our broad goal is to understand the proximate and ul-
timate factors responsible for general patterns of pop-
ulation variability, such as the ubiquity of stability and
cycles and the rarity of more complex dynamical pat-
terns. Work to date has centered on predator-prey
(rotifer-algal) microcosms having the potential to ex-
hibit a wide range of qualitative dynamics. LinkedNovember 1, 2003 EvolDir 9
experimental and theoretical studies have allowed us
to show that feedbacks between ecological and evolu-
tionary processes play an essential role in the system’s
dynamic properties. Future directions for experimen-
tal and theoretical work will include: relationships be-
tween genetic variability and ecological dynamics; more
complex experimental communities; management im-
plications of rapid evolution; and extending the work
to natural aquatic communities. We believe in giving
students the widest possible scope to independently de-
velop research projects reﬂecting their interests within
the general area of the projec! t.
Funding is available for 3 years of RA support (tu-
ition + stipend); at least 1 year of TA’ing or teach-
ing will be expected. Students in either graduate ﬁeld
are admitted with a guarantee of continued support
so long as they make steady progress towards their
degree. For additional information please contact us

ship on New Zealand mites
Measuring the biodiversity of New Zealand’s mesostig-
matid mites: molecular and morphological approaches
Mites represent a large and important component of
worldwide biodiversity and appear to be over repre-
sented in the New Zealand fauna. As part of an ongo-
ing study investigating the evolution of parasitism we
have discovered several undescribed species of mesostig-
matid mites. We will use molecular and morphological
approaches to examine the species status and evolu-
tionary relationships of these and other mesostigmatid
mites in New Zealand. Important questions about the
endemicity of New Zealand’s mite fauna and its Gond-
wanan biogeographical links will be examined. The pre-
cise details of the project will be determined according
to the background and interests of the student.
The student will obtain a thorough knowledge of the
latest techniques in molecular and morphological sys-
tematics and phylogenetic and taxonomic methodol-
ogy. The student will be based at Lincoln University
in the heart of New Zealand’s South Island, close to
Christchurch, with access to a fully equipped molecular
lab and entomology research museum and opportunities
for ﬁeld work elsewhere in New Zealand.
The scholarship is for NZ$16,000 per year for up to
three years plus tuition fees up to the amount incurred
by New Zealand students. Applicants who are not New
Zealand residents or Australian, French or German na-
tionals will have to ﬁnd additional funds to pay inter-
national students fees.

of Southeast Asia and my students will be strongly en-
couraged to participate in these studies. Currently, we
are pursuing two main projects in my lab: 1) DNA ﬁn-
gerprinting techniques for tropical timbers and 2) phy-
logeography of three major tree groups.
We are now completing a pilot study in the ﬁrst project
using a single timber species. Our results indicate that
sensitive tests for the geographic origin can be per-
formed using standard molecular markers. The ability
to determine geographic origin of timber will then al-
low purchasers to objectively choose legally harvested
product. The challenge now is to develop the necessary
databases along with high-throughput techniques and
to apply the tests for understudied groups of timber
species (little things like that...
The second project is an extension of previous work
I have done on the phylogeography of Southeast Asian
stone oaks. We have examined sequence data from both
the chloroplast and nuclear genomes for over 400 indi-
viduals in eleven diﬀerent locations across the region.
The results indicate that these populations have ex-
perienced little migration and have been persistent for
long periods of time ( >>1 million years). The stone
oaks are upland dominants. To complete the picture,
we are now beginning to examine the phylogeographic
patterns of genetic variation in two other major groups:
one dominant in the lowlands and one dominant in peat
swamp forest. Combining and comparing the patterns
among these three major groups should provide a very
enlightening and comprehensive understanding of the
history of tropical rainforest in the region.
Candidates should have a strong background in plant
evolution and systematics and be willing to cope with
the beneﬁts and frustrations of conducting research
based on the other side of the world. Currently, I have

sistant and the Graduate School at Texas Tech Univer-

Faculty of Science
The Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA) is one of the
leading institutions for higher education in Europe.
It participates in the international science network,
collaborating with major universities throughout the
world. The faculty has four departments, with about
1,500 employees including researchers and lecturers,
150 full-time and part-time professors operating in
eleven research institutes. Each institute has its own
research programme that is ﬁnanced by the faculty, the

Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED)
The Center for Research in Experimental Economics
and political Decision making (CREED) and the Insti-
tute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED)of the Universiteit van Amsterdam are collaborating
in an interdisciplinary project, studying the simulta-
neous evolution of social behavior and social institu-
tions with techniques from both Evolutionary Biology
and Experimental Economics. This project is funded
by the Netherlands Organization for Scientiﬁc Research
(NWO).
The project aims at studying other-regarding behav-
ior (such as altruism) on the one hand and both for-
mal (such as social networks) and informal institutions
(such as social norms) on the other hand. The focus
will be on how these behaviors and institutions interact
at the evolutionary time scale. The project is split in
two subprojects: one developing theory from a biolog-
ical background, the other applying laboratory experi-
ments in the tradition of experimental economics. From
the start the interaction between these two subprojects
will be intensive. More information about this project
is available on http://www.fee.uva.nl/creed/evolution .
We invite applications for two positions in this project.

UNevadaReno EcolEvol
PhD studentship at the University of Nevada Reno with
Guy A. Hoelzer
I invite applications to the graduate program in Ecol-
ogy, Evolution, and Conservation Biology to work with
me on spatially explicit, computational modeling of
evolutionary systems. Ultimate goals of this work are
potentially quite variable, and the student will be ex-
pected to play a central role in choosing directions taken
in the dissertation, although the research should includea systematic exploration of the generic eﬀects of key pa-
rameters relating to isolation-by-distance and the spa-
tial conﬁgurations and of evolving systems. The dis-
sertation could also include, for example, development
of a dynamical network model of representing a spe-
ciﬁc species or ecosystem in nature, which could have
application to management of a system for the conser-
vation of biodiversity and/or ecosystem function. The
research program with which this individual would be-
come involved should be of particular interest to some-
one interested in developing a complex dynamical sys-
tem perspective, or a thermodynamic perspective, on
the process of biological evolution. A successful ap-
plicant for this position will come with skills in the
use of object oriented programming languages, such
as C++ or JAVA, and experience with programming
platforms like MatLab is preferred. The stipend sup-
porting this student will initially come in the form of
a teaching assistantship, but several colleagues and I
are actively pursuing grants that, if successful, would
provide a graduate research assistant stipend. Prospec-
tive applicants should contact Dr. Guy Hoelzer at
<hoelzer@unr.edu >.

Dear Evoldir Colleagues-
Please pass on this message to anyone who might be
interested in the position.
I am seeking to hire a full-time permanent lab-
oratory technician to conduct research in the ar-
eas of quantitative and molecular genetics of shell-
ﬁsh, especially oysters. The position is with the
USDA Agricultural Research Service as part of
a program for the selective breeding of cultured
shellﬁsh ( http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/-
projects.htm?ACCN NO@5577&fy 02) . The posi-
tion is located in Newport, OR at Oregon State
University’s Hatﬁeld Marine Science Center ( http://-
hmsc.oregonstate.edu/ ). This new laboratory is being
set up for high-throughput genotyping of microsatel-
lites, AFLPs, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, in-
cluding automated DNA sequencing and liquid han-
dling. Research will focus on using traditional and
molecular genetic methods for elucididating the genetic
covariance structure, QTL mapping and gene expres-
sion analyses of loci contributing to life history traits,
stress and disease resistance, economically important
characters such as shelf-life and meat quality, and mor-
phological characters such as shell shape and coloration
patterns.
The ideal candidate would have a Master’s degree, but
practical experience in molecular genetics would be con-
sidered equivalent if it provided familiarity with the
necessary molecular techniques (DNA/RNA isolation,
PCR, electrophoresis, molecular cloning, DNA sequenc-
ing etc.). Familiarity with the bioinformatic and sta-tistical approaches used to analyze molecular genetic
data for population-level patterning and QTL mapping
are also highly desirable, but training can be provided.
There will be some ﬁeld work required for animal rear-
ing and data collection.
I am looking for more of a high-level laboratory man-
ager who will contribute to the intellectual aspects of
the work rather than simply a pair of hands at the
bench. There will be ample scope for independent
projects, presentation of results at meetings and in
publications, and participation in formulating research
agendas. The advertised salary range is large, so there
is ample scope for advancement for more junior appli-
cants, and more senior applicants will be given full con-
sideration.
Newport is a small, oceanfront city with unspoiled
beaches, an active ﬁshing ﬂeet, and numerous tourist
attractions located at the mouth of the Yaquina Bay
on the central Oregon coast. The cost of living is very
reasonable, especially compared to other west coast ar-
eas. Portland is about 2.5 hours north, and Corvallis is
about 1 hour east.
Please email or call me with any questions, but be sure
to apply according to the instructions in the oﬃcial an-
nouncement below, including a cover letter that specif-
ically addresses the required skills. The federal govern-
ment can be very exacting when it comes to these de-
tails, and applications are ﬁltered by human resources
staﬀ before being forwarded to scientists.

she is now and I can’t seem to ﬁnd her via web searches.
I have some questions for her about her past research
and would really like to ﬁnd her. I would greatly ap-
preciate any help that anyone out there can give me.Thanks a lot, Shanna

AFLP problem
Hi everyone,
I am doing some AFLP work on Aspelinium sp (Fern)
using the ABI kit for AFLP. I am having problems of
getting product in the selective ampliﬁcation stage (
that’s what I think). In the beginning we thought there
was a restriction problem with Acer but a southern test
revealed otherwise. I did PCR and got excellent result
which excluded the possibility of PCR inhibitor in my
DNA samples. When I ran my restriction/ligation and
preampliﬁcation product on agarose gel they looked ﬁne
but didn’t get much product in the selective ampliﬁca-
tion round. I worked with apple DNA last year using
the same kit and had excellent result. I included my
apple sample as a control and they were ﬁne as well
this time again. I will really appreciate if someone can
suggest any solution to come around this problem.

ANSWERS :
I also worked on microsatellite development and de-
signed primers for several species yet...I’ve been using
software package LASERGENE - program called “DNA
star”. It’s a program easy to work with and has many
useful features (editing sequences, setting preferences
for your primers, etc.). Well, I would recommend it, al-
though I have never worked with any other programs,
so I can’t compare.
We use the online program Primer3 at http://www-
genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi- bin/primer/primer3 www.cgi
Im in the midst of doing the same thing for Rana
boylii, and Ive found that the company Invitrogen has
a good primer design site that is free: Oligoperfect De-
signer, which you can ﬁnd at this web address - http:/-
/www.invitrogen.com/content.cfm?pageid=9716
I also use Integrated DNA Technologies which has a
primer analyzer website that is free: OligoAnalyzer
athttp://biotools.idtdna.com/analyzer/ - If you have
funds available though, I would recommend purchas-
ing the software package Oligo which you can ﬁnd info
for at this address: http://www.oligo.net/ . It is a bit
pricey, and that is why Ive had to use the free web
based packages.
I have used the web-based Primer3 to suggest
primer sequences from clone sequences and Am-
plify to check these primers for primer-dimer prob-
lems etc. Primer3: http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/-
cgi-bin/primer/primer3 www.cgi Amplify (mac only):
http://engels.genetics.wisc.edu/amplify/ Two good
programs to use in conjuntion with each other are
Primer 3 and amplify. both are available on the web.
Primer 3, helps select primers and is a web-based pro-
gram. amplify run oﬀ a Mac and does virtual PCR to
test for dimer formation.
I use Primer Designer v. 2.0 with great success for de-
signing primers for my microsatellites. I was not happy
with Primer 3 which is available online. When I an-
alyzed primers I designed in Primer 3 primers using
Primer 2 most of them had hairpins.
Primer 3 has done a great job picking my primers. I
got a good product in 90% of the cases. http://www-
genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3 www.cgi I46 EvolDir November 1, 2003
know there exist some on-line primer-search programs,
such as Primer3. You will ﬁnd some more links if you
go to http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/GenomeWeb/nuc-
primer.html . Otherwise, I used a relatively old version
of a DOS-based program called Oligo, which is good
but not very user-friendly. Perhaps there are newer
versions at http://www.oligo.net/ ... but I just found
out it is not for free.
I have cut & pasted the following paragraphs from
my PhD thesis. Hopefully they will oﬀer you a pos-
sible avenue for exploration! The microsatellite re-
peat and the ﬂanking region sequence was inputted
into the GeneRunner program (available from http://-
www.generunner.com/ ). The microsatellite repeat was
highlighted, and the PCR Primer Selection function
was performed. The default values were initially kept,
but changed in the following approach to reduce the
suggested primers to below 150 pairs: * Increase min-
imum primer length to 20. * Increase lower primer
melting temperature. * Reduce primer melting tem-
perature diﬀerence. * Narrow the %GC range from
35-65 to 40-60, then 43-57. All or some of these steps
were needed, depending on the amount of ﬂanking se-
quence available in each individual microsatellite. The
recommended primer pairs, were then assessed for inter-
molecular and intramolecular secondary structures such
as hairpin loops, dimers and internal loops. Primers
that displayed a high negative dG ( >-9) value were dis-
carded, the greater the negative value, the more stable
the duplex formed by the primer.
I have used the following internet based program. I
worked ﬁne, I mostly used default options and got
some decent primers, though always visually check the
primers the program suggests and their suitability for

Diversity simulation software
Dear all,
I am searching for a software program that can simulate
the changes in the level of population genetic diversity
(allelic diversity, heterozygostiy). This program shouldtake into account the following variables: number of
generations, population size and migration rate.
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

answers
Thank you to everyone who gave me information
concerning software programs that can simulate the
changes in the level of population genetic diversity (al-
lelic diversity, heterozygostiy). As requested, I’ve com-
piled the advice I received:
1) See http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/ESP.html
and for an example: Bohonak, A. J., N. Davies, F.
X. Villablanca, and G. K. Roderick. 2001. Invasion
genetics of New World medﬂies: testing alternative col-
onization scenarios. Biological Invasions 3: 103-111.
2) You could use the METAPOP program. It simulates
the evolution of the genetic diversity in a metapopula-
tion. You can specify the number of populations, pop-
ulation size, migration rate, mating system, number of
loci etc. See e.g. Le Corre, Machon, Petit & Kremer.

3) Try VORTEX by Bob Lacy ( http://-
pw1.netcom.com/ ˜ rlacy/vortex.html ). It is a bit
complex, but very powerful.
4) I’ve written a population genetics program which
can do that, it is available at: http://www2.unil.ch/-
izea/softwares/easypop.html Depending on your exact
needs, you might wish to use a slightly modiﬁed ver-
sion. One option might be a version where you enter
the seeds for the random number generator manually, so
that you can replicate simulations with the same seeds
but diﬀerent number of generations. Alternatively you
might wish to use a version which provides genotypes
at diﬀerent generations. Note that depending on the
complexity of your problem it might also be solved an-
alytically.

EvolSocialBehaviour Journal
Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce a new journal relevant to
the evolution of social behaviour, interaction and com-
munication. Details are available by following the web
link at the end of the announcement below.
Best Regards,
C. L. Nehaniv Interaction Studies, Associate Editor
Interaction Studies: Social Behaviour and Communica-
tion in Biological and Artiﬁcial Systems
Publisher: John Benjamins Publishing Company
Editors-in-Chief:
Kerstin Dautenhahn (University of Hertfordshire,
United Kingdom) Harold Gouzoules (Emory Univer-
sity, USA)
Aims and Scope:
The journal aims to advance knowledge in the growing
and strongly interdisciplinary area of interaction stud-
ies in biological and artiﬁcial systems. It intends to act
as a medium for dialogues across the boundaries of aca-
demic disciplines for research into social behaviour and
communication that has traditionally been presented in
separate specialist journals.
Understanding social behaviour and communication in
biological and artiﬁcial systems involves important is-
sues such as evolutionary, developmental and neurobio-
logical aspects of social behaviour and communication;
the embodied nature of interactions; origins and char-
acteristics of social and narrative intelligence; percep-
tion, action and communication in the context of dy-
namic and social environments; social learning, adap-
tation and imitation; investigating social behaviour in
human-machine interactions; the nature of empathic
understanding, behaviour and intention reading; min-
imal requirements and systems exhibiting social be-
haviour; the role of cultural factors in shaping social
behaviour and communication in biological or artiﬁcial
societies. The journal welcomes papers that analyze
social behaviour in humans and other animals as well
as research into the design and synthesis of robotic,
software, virtual and other artiﬁcial systems, including
applications such as exploiting human-machine inter-actions for educational or therapeutic purposes. Pa-
pers can be experimental, computational, or theoret-
ical studies and should highlight the contribution to
knowledge of social behaviour and communication in
biological and artiﬁcial systems.
Submissions are invited from researchers working in the
natural, human and social sciences as well as those
working in the sciences of the artiﬁcial. Fields of in-
terest comprise, but are not limited to evolutionary bi-
ology, artiﬁcial intelligence, artiﬁcial life, robotics, psy-
chology, cognitive neuroscience, computational neuro-
science, ethology, social and biological anthropology,
palaeontology, animal behaviour, linguistics.

Genetic diversity answers
Dear all, Thanks to all the people who kindly answered
and sent information about my question of how to com-
pare genetic diversity values. It seems that a lot of
people have the same question and they are interesting
to know diﬀerent opinions. So, I made a compilation
of the answers I received. My specially acknowledge-
ment to Dr. Mike Weale (University College London)
who has just developed a program to the testing of
h “test hdiﬀ” ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/software/-
index.html )
Marina
Question: I estimated the genetic diversity in four pop-
ulations, and I want to know if the diversity values are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. So, I need to use some statistical
test. Does somebody have any idea about which test
(and program) should I use? Thanks a lot, Marina
Answers: 1) I did a t-test using microsoft Excel to test
statistical signiﬁcance of diﬀerence at genetic diversity
parameters between populations. The SAS program
can also do a signiﬁcance test for you.
2) To compare means, Nei (1987) suggests simply the-
paired t-test. For microsats you could perhaps do it
straight on but e.g. for allozymes it is good to consider
arcsine transformation. (You might check our paper,
where we experimentally looked at the sensitivity of
the test.) Practically all basic statistical programs per-
form it. Reference: Tapio et al. (2003) Comparison of
microsatellite and blood protein diversity in sheep: in-
consistencies in fragmented breeds. Molecular Ecology
12, 2045-2056.
3) The basic technique consists in a Wilcoxon paired
(by locus) test, but if you have four populations this
will make 6 comparisons with a corrected level of signif-
icance of 0.008 (very conservative but necessary). De-
pending on the question you might pool some samples
to compare two groups of interest. If not then you can
do a Friedman analysis of variance (for three entries),
I do not know of any software doing it but it is well
described in ’Siegel & Castellan 1988, Non parametric
statistics for the behavioural sciences, McGraw-Hill’.
4) This is a problem I have grappled with for some
time. It is remarkably diﬃcult to ﬁnd a robust test for
the diﬀerence in two h values for the following reasons.a) Permutation tests are not valid. These operate un-
der the null hypothesis of no diﬀerence in haplotype
frequencies, which is not the same as no diﬀerence in
h values. b) Bootstrapping methods are biased. Un-
der this method, you resample assuming that observed
haplotype frequencies exactly equate to real population
haplotype frequencies. This leads to a bias of n/(n-
1) between the mean h of the bootstrap samples and
the expected h of the real population. If h is close
to 1, this bias diﬀerence, even for moderately large n
(20<n<100), can be so large that the expected real h
of the population falls outside of the 95% conﬁdence
interval on the bootstrapped h. c) The sampling distri-
bution of h is skewed, especially for values close to 1.
Thus, although unbiased formulae exist for the mean
and variance of this distributution, Z-tests based on
these formulae may fall foul of the departure from as-
sumed Normality.
Currently, the approach I adopt employs both Method
(2) and Method (3) above in a conservative double-
testing procedure. In Method (2), samples from both
populations are bootstrapped, a sampling distribution
for the diﬀerence in h is obtained, and a 2-tailed P-
value is calculated based on twice the smaller frequency
of values lying to one side of zero. In Method (3), un-
biased h’s and their sampling variances are calculated
from standard formulae (e.g. see Nei’s book on Molec-
ular Evolutionary Genetics), and a P-values for the dif-
ference in h is obtained via the standard Z-test. As a
conservative measure, the larger of these two P-values
is then used. The above approach is heuristic and does
not guarantee a conservative Type I error rate, but at
least it does something to address the issue.

ers of Jewish communities: Geographically separated
Jewish groups were independently founded by very few
female ancestors. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 70:1411-1420.
One day later: I’ve created a package for the testing
of h diﬀerences based on the methods I discussed in
the previous email. They should appear as a package
called “test hdiﬀ” within the next 24 hours at the fol-
lowing web site: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/software/-

Genetic diversity answers 2
Hi everybody, It seems that it is an interesting point of
analysis since I am still receiving answers. I really ap-
preciate all your collaboration. Here I posted the last
answers. Thanks a lot. Marina
1) I would recommend you the Arlequin software. You
can downoad it from the http://lgb.unige.ch/arlequin/
Take a look at the Users manual, there is the basic
theory for a lot of statistical methods for population
diﬀerentiation and so.
2) I somehow missed your question. Just a quick com-
ment: microsatellite mutation rates diﬀer dramatically
among loci-thus you may be better advised to make a
paired test (e.g.: sign test). I attach you a manuscript
in which we used this approach. Reference: Caracristi
and Schoeltterer (2003) Genetic diﬀerentation between
American and European Drosophila melanoganster
Population could be attributed to admixture of African
alleles. Mol. Biol. Evol. 20(5):792-799.
3) This is a late answer to your question on compar-
ing genetic diversity values. But I did not see anything
closely resembling this in your compilation of answers.
Assume that each of P sampled population has its own
theta p through the exchange of m migrants in a pop-
ulation of Ne in an inﬁnite island model. With Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods it is possible to get an ap-
proximation to the posterior distribution of genetic di-
versity values (theta p) for each one of P populations.
You can declare two populations diﬀerent if the poste-
rior values overlap little (e.g. the 95% intervals do not
overlap). I attach a preprint, where the method is ap-
plied to a sample of Drosophila ananassae populations.
Reference: Vogl et al. (2003). Population subdivision
and molecular sequence variation: Theory and analysis
of Drosophila ananassae data. In press.
4) Arlequin is a good computer programme that en-
ables you to carry out this sort of test. You can do
an ’exact test of population diﬀerentiation’ and there is
good documentation with the programme. I am work-
ing on a Macintosh computer and I found that the 2001
patch for the programme doesn’t seem to work, but the
original version (2000) seems to work ﬁne.Marina S. Ascunce, Ph. D.

Mantel test answers
Hi everyone, Thank you very much to all the people
that replied my question. I’ve received lots of mails,
half of them with interesting ideas and literature and
half of them asking me to send them the feedback. So
here are the most interesting answers I got.
THE QUESTION—- >Fst/(1-Fst) or Fst for mantel
test, and why??
THE MAIN ANSWERS:
The answer to your question on the Evoldir network
regarding isolation by distance is in Rousset (1997, Ge-
netics; see also his 2001 review in Handbook of statisti-
cal genetics, ed by Balding et al.). Using Fst / (1 Fst)
is based on a formal population genetics model, under
which you actually expect a relationship with distance.
The relationship is expected to hold under conditions
larger than those modelled by Rousset (1997). See a
recent paper by Leblois et al. in MBE.
————————–
Fst is distributed between 0 and 1, whereas Fst/(1-
Fst) potentially varies between 0 and inﬁnity. When
you are doing correlations, upper or lower bounds are
a nuisance, and in this way you at least get rid of the
former.
As for isolation by distance (ibd), my feeling is that the
term is used in two ways, both loosely and strictly. In
many recent papers, I see people loosely call ibd any
correlation between genetic and geographic distance.
In these cases, a Mantel test is Ok. Strictly speak-
ing, though, (which means in the sense of Mal` ecot-
Morton and Kimura-Weiss), ibd is the product of ge-
netic drift leading populations to diverge, and short-
range gene ﬂow leading them to converge genetically.
Both in models where populations are continuously
(Mal` ecot-Morton) or discontinuously (Kimura-Weiss)
distributed, that combination of drift and gene ﬂow
causes an asymptotic decline of genetic resemblance
with distance. In other words, kinship between pop-November 1, 2003 EvolDir 51
ulations decreases up to a certain distance, and then it
goes to zero.
In practice, the two diﬀerent deﬁnitions do make a dif-
ference, because (1) under the former, but not under
the latter any genetic gradient or cline (including those
determined by long-range gene ﬂow, range expansion
and the like) are taken as evidence of ibd, and (2) over
an area much greater than the dispersal distance of the
species you are studying, drift and gene ﬂow may gen-
erate local clines but not a general correlation between
genetic and geographic distances.
I hope these comments did not increase the confusion.
The relevant literature is wide, but among the oldies
I would still recomment Cavalli-Sforza and Wijsman
(1984) Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 15:279-301, Kimura
& Weiss (1964) Genetics 49:561-576 and Slatkin (1989)
Genome 31:196-202.
————————————
I use Fst/(1-Fst) as recommended by Rousset’s 1997
Genetics article. Whereas Fst goes to 1 as populations
become more diﬀerentiated, Fst/(1-Fst) goes to inﬁn-
ity. So if you’re regressing against geographic distance,
which goes to inﬁnity, it’s appropriate to use Fst/(1-
Fst). Also, something a lot of authors overlook is that
you should specify whether you are considering your
populations to be in 1-dimensional arrays or 2-d ar-
rays. If they are essentially 1-dimensional (like along a
river) you should regress against geographic distance,
but if you consider your populations to be in 2-d ar-
rays, you should use its log transform. Rousset covers
this as well- that and Slatkin’s 1993 (Evolution) and
1985 (Ann Rev Ecol Syst) articles have been the most
helpful to me.
—————————————–
A variety of measures have been used on the “Y” and
“X” axis of IBD plots. For examples, see:
Slatkin, M. 1993. Isolation by distance in equilibrium
and non-equilibrium populations. Evolution 47: 264-
79.
Rousset, F. 1997. Genetic diﬀerentiation and estima-
tion of gene ﬂow from F-statistics under isolation by
distance. Genetics 145: 1219-28.

lation of pairwise genetic and geographic distance mea-
sures: inferring the relative inﬂuences of gene ﬂow and
drift on the distribution of genetic variability. Evolu-
tion 53: 1898-914.
Even the geographic distance axis is log-transformed in
some cases and not others.
I suggest that you examine scatterplots and try a vari-ety of metrics, log-transformed or not. If you are inter-
ested in the IBD slope, then the most important consid-
eration is that the plot meets the standard assumptions
of regression (the relationship is linear, residuals are not
skewed, etc.)
Seehttp://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/IBD.html for
some software to help with this.

Mantel test question
Hello to everyone on the Evoldir list,
I have a question for anyone who has used a Mantel
test in the past. I am comparing genetic and physical
distance, and had previously analysed the relationship
with a simple correlation. It has been suggested that I
use a Mantel test as a control for the pseudoreplication
issues that come from using multiple pairwise compar-
isons. The problem I’ve run into is that of missing data.
My data forms a 8x8 semimatrix - but because of a vari-
ety of reasons, approximately 40% of the matrix is just
empty cells. All of the programs I have found that cal-
culate Mantel tests don’t talk about how to deal with
missing data.
Have any of you encountered this problem before? I
suppose I could just ﬁll in the cells with the average
for the dataset, but I’m hesitant to do that with such
a large proportion of missing data.
Thanking you all in advance, Kelly

Mantel test question answers
Thank you to everyone who provided help with my
problem of how to calculate a Mantel test when you
have empty cells in the matrices. As requested, I’ve
compiled the advice I received:
Recommendations:
“I used Mantel test and bootstrap analysis (matrix
reshuﬄing), but I did not have to deal with missing
cells.”
PASSAGE: “The program PASSAGE is available for
free download at http://lsweb.la.asu.edu/rosenberg/-
Passage/ , where you can ﬁnd contact information for
the author, Dr. Michael S. Rosenberg. He may be able
to address the issue of missing data if the user’s manual
does not.”
EXCEL add-in: “The PopTools add-in for Excel will
also do Mantel’s test, is available for free download
atwww.cse.csiro.au/poptools, and is written by Greg
Hood. If the help menu isn’t helpful regarding miss-
ing data, you might give the author an email at pop-
tools.cse.csiro.au or at g.hood@cgiar.org”
GenAlEx: “The program i ﬁnd easiest to use for PCA,
AMOVAs, genetic distances and other simple popu-
lation genetic work is GenAlEx (Genetic Analysis in
Excel). It free to download: www.anu.edu.au/BoZo/-
GenAlEx and has a mantel test function.”
ECOSIM: “Maybe an interesting way to go is to
download a program called ECOSIM ( http://-
homepages.together.net/ ˜ gentsmin/ecosim.htm ),
transform your matrices in vectors (as if they were
regular variables), run a regression analysis and look
at the correlation coeﬃcients tab. This program will
perform a random permutation of your data (like a
Mantel program would), but it will not care whether
there are empty cells in the matrices (provided that
both matrices have the same number of non-missing
cells).”
NTSYS: “try the Programm NTSYS. NTSYS can han-
dle missing data during matrix comparison. Maybe this
can help. You can put a certain value (e.g. 9999) as a
code for missing data. Also with NTSYS it is possible
to do normalization as well as permutations”
“The Mantel test in NTSYSpc (available from ExeterSoftware) allows missing values.”
“I had some missing data, but nowhere near 40% as
you say you have. I used a software package called
NTSYS that was designed by one of my professors, Dr.
F. James Rohlf at SUNY Stony Brook. I seem to recall
that the software allowed one to enter a value of ”??¿‘
to indicate an unknown quantity. One’s also had the
opportunity to modify the term that could be used to
enter an unknown value.”

Micro isolation
Two common methods for microsatellite isolation from
genomes low in microsatellite frequency (e.g. aves)
are 1) selective hybridization using streptavidin-coated
magnetic beads, and 2) Lambda Zap (Stratagene).
Could I please get input from any researchers who have
used either of these methods as to their eﬀectiveness
in isolating microsatellites, and any problems or delays
encountered and how they were overcome? Please send
correspondence to gregos@mcmaster.ca. A summary of
all replies will follow.

Micros MegaBACE
Dear all,
This mail for asking Evoldir members advice for geno-
typing on MegaBACE 1000 DNA Analysis System
(Amersham Biosciences). We acquired several months
ago this 48 capillaries DNA analysis system in our
lab. We intend to do sequencing and genotyping (at
the moment, microsatellites). For the latter, we would
like to share protocols and experience with labs work-
ing on this equipment and alike markers. It would
concern oligo synthetis, PCR mix, precipitation, run
parameters, etc... It would greatly help us to bene-
ﬁt from your experience to reduce the long-time and
energy-consuming optimisation step. If several labs
are interested, we could create an e-mailing list of the
megabace/microsatellites users.

Molecular Variance Parsimony
Hi,
I was wondering if anyone knows of a software that
can create spanning networks based on molecular vari-
ance parsimony (Excoﬃer and Smouse 1994). I have
used MINSPNET, but this creates a network using just
one replicate of each haplotype and does not calculate
any population statistic based on haplotype frequen-
cies. Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.

Molecular markers
Dear all,
Please forgive me if these questions seem a bit basic.
Our lab is interested in molecular markers for studying
inter and intra speciﬁc relationships and gene mapping
for wild and cultivated species of tomato. We are cur-
rently trying to use as many molecular marker systems
as possible.
1) How important is it for any molecular marker, to
be selectively neutral ? This is because a fairly recent
marker technique known as IMP (Inter MITE Poly-
morphism) was described by Bureau et al (2001) using
MITEs which have a preference for insertion near or
within genes - which suggests (to me) that these mark-
ers will probably not be selectively neutral.
Will this aﬀect the calculations for linkage and its ap-
plication in gene mapping? This is because the calcu-
lations or linkage...etc seem to be based on allele fre-
quencies obtained from the marker, and if most of the54 EvolDir November 1, 2003
marker loci are not neutral, then how do we distinguish
between “real” linkage and selective pressures inﬂuenc-
ing allele frequencies ?
I would really aprreciate any comments, suggestions,
ideas. Thank you all so much,

Outcrossing from AFLPs
Dear All, A student of mine is designing her thesis re-
search to estimate outcrossing rate on an endangered
plant species. Does she has to use codominant data? Is
there any software available that can do a good job for
estimating this parameter using dominant data, such
as AFLP?
She plans to collect plant materials from the ﬁeld and
the seeds of each plant she collects. The seedlings from
the seeds will be included in the analysis. So the “geno-
type” of the mother and oﬀsprings will be known. In
such analysis, how many mother plants and how many
oﬀspring from each mother are minimum? Any infor-
mation and advise will be helpful! Sincerely, Jenny Xi-

Outcrossing from AFLPs answers
The standard program for estimating outrcrossing ratesNovember 1, 2003 EvolDir 55
is Kermit Ritland’s MLTR (which I have used quite ex-
tensively), however this only accomodates codominant
data. Kermit has another program, MLDT, which is
intended for dominant data (which I have not used).
Both programs are apparently pretty identical, except
for the data type. They can be downloaded from:
http://genetics.forestry.ubc.ca/ritland/programs.html
In terms of number of maternal plants, and number
of seeds per plant: I have generally found that 20-30
maternal families, with 5-10 seeds per family will give
resonable estimates. Usually, increasing the number of
maternal families improves the outrcrossing rate esti-
mate more than adding more seeds per maternal fam-
ily. However, these numbers are for codominant (al-
lozyme) data. dominant data may give less information
per locus, so you may need to use more maternal plants
and/or seeds.
Feel free to write back if you have any questions about
using MLTR/MLDT

We have used microsatellites, which are generally con-
sidered codominant, for estimating outcrossing rates
and found that null alleles (just like a recessive al-
lele in the analysis) really mess up the estimates of
outcrossing rates (manuscript attached to this mes-
sage). The Holsinger program does estimate outcross-
ing rates with dominant data, but the error margins
are HUGE with dominant data! I strongly discourage
you from dominant markers for estimating outcrossing
rates. Isozymes give you much better estimates (as long
as you can take enough tissue from your plants withoutcausing damage).

I’m not sure whether Kermit Ritland’s programs allow
for dominant markers, but for an unsuccessful grant
proposal a few years ago, I did a few simulations sug-
gesting that with a relatively small number of polymor-
phic loci (say 30) you can distinguish selfed progeny
from outcross progeny by scoring as outcrossed any oﬀ-
spring that do *not* match the maternal genotype at
recessive loci.
I’m attaching the Word document that describes the
simulations. You can ignore the likelihood/Bayesian
stuﬀ that follows, unless you’re interested.

Phylogenetic analysis
Hello, I am trying to do a comparative analysis with
one binary and one continuous variable. I have a com-
plete phylogeny and would be really grateful if anyone
could suggest a method and program that could do such
an analysis or perhaps a reference of some one who has
done something similar. I am having real diﬃculty ﬁnd-
ing anything.
My email address is j.c.pomfret@qmul.ac.uk Thanks

Phylogenetic analysis answers
I asked a question about how to deal with binary char-
acteristics in comparative studies. Here are the re-
sponses I received which a lot of people have asked to
be posted on the Evoldir website. Thanks to all those
who wrote to me and were extremely helpful
FIRST I believe it must be diﬃcult, but it really should
depend on what do you want to correlate with what.
What is your question will tell what you need to do.
I have done a very similar thing, even perhaps a lit-
tle bit more complicated, but the truth is, the method
for very complicated things I don’t thing is there yet!!!
In other words, people may be pseudoreplicating some
still....
If you know CRUSH and BRUNCH in CAIC... then
you know everything, if you don’t know them, or don’t
know how to use them, then I can help you...
the manual for CAIC explains everything that you need
to know, of course, if you have a background (not
match) in basic statistics (regression analysis, use of
residuals, and so forth).
The problem is to code the phylogeny... even if it is
complete... you will need to let CAIC know what the
phylogeny is, and that may be tedious...
NEXT
I just had the same problem that I wanted to com-
pare genome size (continuous variable) with life his-tory and breeding system (both coded as binary vari-
ables). I used the computer programs Continuous by
Mark Pagel: http://sapc34.rdg.ac.uk/meade/Mark/-
which is based on the generalised least squares method
and CAIC by Andy Purvis: http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/-
evolve/software/caic/ which is a program using the
independent contrast method. I strongly recommend
comparing diﬀerent approaches because both methods
have their assumptions that cannot be easily met. Both
authors were very helpful answering questions about
the program.
NEXT
CAIC can do this (if I remember right you need the
“BRUNCH” option (don’t ask me why it is called this
- it is in the manual). You can ﬁnd CAIC at:
http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/evolve/software/caic/-
index.html NEXT I share your frustration. I
too do phylogenetics (molecular cyt-b), and I have
been looking into comparative analysis. I have not
come across any papers that do comparative analysis
at the species-level, most studies use larger datasets
drawn from higher taxonomic levels. I assume you
know of the program CAIC (Comparative Analysis
using Independent Contrasts) (which has two compo-
nents CardInput, and Phylogeny)? You can download
those programs from the web (written by Andrew
Rambaut, Oxford University).
NEXT
You should download CAIC ( http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/-
evolve/software/caic/ ). Once you have coded your phy-
logeny and set up your data ﬁles in the appropriate way,
you then perform the analysis using the BRUNCH pro-
cedure for dichotomous variables. Let me know if you
need any more help.
NEXT
Just wanted to point out that you could do this
in COMPARE (compare.bio.indiana.edu) using several
diﬀerent methods.

You may have already heard of these programs and
found them unsuitable but have you looked into
CAIC (available at http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/evolve/-November 1, 2003 EvolDir 57
software/caic/ ) or Continuous (available at http:/-
/www.bio.ic.ac.uk/evolve/software/caic/ ). I believe
Continuous accepts binary data but I’ve never used it.
Both are available free on the web.
NEXT
You can ﬁnd PASSAGE, an excellent Windows-based
program to do the Mantel tests you described at the
following link.
NEXT It depends on whether your dependent variable
is continuous or binary. If your dependent variable is
continuous (and I assume normally distributed), you
can use generalized least squares (e.g. Martins and
Hansen 1997) (or equivalently, independent contrasts
[Felsenstein 1985]). If your dependent variable is bi-
nary (ie binomially distributed), you could use the Gen-
eralized Estimating Equation approach (Paradis and
Claude 2002). If you have a big phylogeny ( >40
species), you could also look at using the phylogenetic
mixed model approach of Lynch (1991). These meth-
ods generally assume a brownian motion model of evo-
lution. It is relatively easy to do all these things in R
(http://www.r-project.org ). email me if you need any
more help.

Restriction problems
Dear all,60 EvolDir November 1, 2003
We use the Eco R I and Pst I enzymes and correspond-
ing adaptors for restriction and ligation as a part of
the AFLP procedure. But the problem is that PCR
ampliﬁcation with the corresponding Eco-A and Pst-A
primers doesn’t yield any product.
We tried many things, among which re-ordering all
ingredients (adaptors, enzymes, buﬀers, primers et
cetera) even from diﬀerent companies (Roche and MBI
Fermentas) which did not help at all.
Typically, the same procedure does work for other en-
zyme/adaptor combinations (e.g. Taq I, Mse I), which
seems to exclude our DNA or the PCR being the prob-
lem. Moreover, we used DNA from several species (but-
terﬂies, plants), which made no diﬀerence.
Our most likely conclusion is that the problem must be
incomplete restriction for unknown reasons, though we
can not 100% exclude problems in the ligation.
Basically, we don’t understand what’s going on and are
desperate to ﬁnd a solution. Especially since we used
Eco and Pst without problems in the past and have
to repeat past AFLP runs. A search on the internet
hinted into the direction of DNA methylation, but no
more than that.
Has anyone experienced similar problems, and more im-
portantly solved?
Any advice is greatly appreciated,

Volume 50, Number 17 November 6, 2003 Review
Clockwork Science By Freeman J. Dyson
Today the name of Einstein is known to almost ev-
erybody, the name of Poincar´ e to almost nobody. A
hundred years ago the opposite was true. Then, Albert
Einstein was a newly appointed technical expert, third
class, examining patent applications in the Swiss patent
oﬃce in Bern, having failed in his eﬀorts to ﬁnd an aca-
demic job, while Henri Poincar´ e was one of the leading
ﬁgures of the French scientiﬁc establishment, famous
not only as a great scientist but as the author of popu-
lar books that were translated into many languages and
kept the public informed about the dramatic progress of
science during the early years of the twentieth century.
A hundred years ago, Einstein and Poincar´ e were both
working hard at one of the central problems of science,
trying to ﬁnd a correct theory to describe how fast par-
ticles behave in electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Poincar´ e
had published several papers on the subject which Ein-
stein may or may not have read. Einstein had published
nothing.
Two years later, in 1905, Poincar´ e and Einstein si-
multaneously arrived at a solution to the problem.
Poincar´ e presented a summary of his results to the
French Academy of Sciences in Paris, and in the same
month Einstein mailed his classic paper, “Electrody-
namics of Moving Bodies,” to the German journal An-
nalen der Physik. The two versions of the solution were
in substance almost identical. Both were based on the
principle of relativity, which says that the laws of na-
ture are the same for a moving observer as they are
for an observer standing still. Both agreed with the
experimentally observed behavior of fast particles, and
made the same predictions for the results of future ex-
periments. How then did it happen that Einstein be-
came world-famous as the discoverer of relativity, while
Poincar´ e did not? Poincar´ e’s lasting fame, such as it
is, derives from his discoveries in other areas of science
and not from his work on relativity.
Is the verdict of posterity, giving all the credit for rela-
tivity to Einstein and none to Poincar´ e, fair or unfair?
I will return to these questions later. [...] questions

Sequence saturation software
answers
Dear all,
Here are the answers to my query:
“Does anyone knows a Macintosh software for (easily)
computing saturation among DNA sequences, as Ti vs
Tv distances plots?”
I should have mention that the “manual” plotting of
distances extracted from PAUP was the only method
I knew, because it appears to be the typical method
used. However, many people asked for a solution, then
such a software is really needed !
Many thanks to all responders.
Answers:
- I suggest you to use TREE-PUZZLE that allows to
test for the presence/absence of phylogenetic signal in
your data set through a graphical approach. You can
download it at the following web site http://www.tree-
puzzle.de/ To my point of view it is much more eﬃcient
than scatter plot analysis to detect the saturation and
consequence lost of phylogenetic signal
- I am wondering about the same thing. I was trying
to ﬁnd one software and asked a lot of people about it.
But no one was aware of it. Finally I did my scatter
plot using EXCEL, which was really painful as the dataset was not very small.
- There is a way to get the numbers out of PAUP, but
it is’nt straightforward to get the graph (you have to
import a table into excel). It works, but is not the easy
way.
- It’s rather easily done in PAUP, actually. Just export
distance matrices to a spreadsheet, ﬁrst selecting only
transitions and then selecting only transversions. You
can then quite easily plot them.
- Does Li93 work in an OsX terminal window? It might,
and if so, that would be great.

Software BAPS
The new version BAPS 2.0 features a GUI and built-in
graphics for Bayesian clustering on the basis of molec-
ular marker data. The algorithm from earlier ver-
sions has been rewritten to speed up the computa-62 EvolDir November 1, 2003
tions, enhance the convergence, and reduce memory
usage, which enables even the analysis of large-scale
data sets. It is now possible to use simultaneously mul-
tiple MCMC chains which facilitate the investigation
of convergence and better ensure that representative
samples are generated from the posterior distribution.
Data from DNA-pooling techniques can now also be
used for clustering. For a typical data set, BAPS 2.0
runs at least 10 faster than the earlier versions. Output
from the simulations is now made into a user friendly
format and can be easily transferred to any Windows-
based text editor. It is also possible to obtain model
averaged FST and pairwise genetic distance estimates.

Software GIMLET
Dear Evoldir members,
A new version of GIMLET (version 1.3.2.) is now avail-
able. This version is available free at http://pbil.univ-
lyon1.fr/software/Gimlet/gimlet.htm The new version
features several improvements on the previous version
of GIMLET, including:
-.- New features for the estimation of population size
with the rarefaction curve method (see pp 15-18 of the
Guide):
* the equation used in Eggert et al. (2003 ; Mol Ecol
12:1389-1402) was added, * user can choose to print the
results for the parameter b of the equations, *user can
choose several distribution parameters (mean, standard
deviation, median, minimim, maximum) to describe the
distribution of the estimates of a and b parameters of
the equations over all iterations, * user can choose the
number of iterations when calling the script ﬁle in R,
* R will try at least 5 times to estimate the asymptote
for each iteration of diﬃcult to ﬁt* data sets before
skipping the iteration and begin the following iteration
calculation (*Hard to ﬁt data sets are for example data
where the samples are sampled only once. The data sets
where samples are sampled several times each are anal-
ysed once and the result is printed, * user can print
the observed and predicted rarefaction curves or thehistogram of the number of capture per sample.
-.- Program can print more output ﬁles in the “Estimate
Error Rates” module: ﬁle to test the bias in ADO in
favor of short or long alleles, ﬁle with all detailed errors
All bugs reported by users are wellcome to en-
hance this new version (register and report to
valiere@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr).
* GIMLET: is a windows based program to analyse
data from individual identiﬁcation using microsatellite
data. Diﬀerent tasks are available: identiﬁcation and
pooling of genotypes, construction of consensus geno-
types and estimation of error rates, estimation of allele
frequencies and heterozygozities, calculation of proba-
bilities of identity, estimation of population size from
genotypes.

Software Treeﬁnder
Hi Folks!
A new TREEFINDER version is online at http://-
www.treeﬁnder.de . This time, the focus was on boot-
strap analysis, graphic display and the extension of the
programming interface.
Bootstrap analysis has now a convenient window dialog
and an option to count and output the distinct topolo-
gies that are seen in the samples. They are assigned
averaged edge lengths and come sorted by frequency.November 1, 2003 EvolDir 63
The tree viewer can now display ﬁles containing thou-
sands of trees. The rerooting utility is able to place
a root node anywhere in a given tree and rearrange-
ments are exportable into popular formats. A collapse
function has been added.
There is an utility to check a sequence alignment for
compositional equilibrium and another one to visualize
the distribution of diﬀerences along the alignment.
Parts of the software have been rewritten in TL lan-
guage and are included as source code that can be mod-
iﬁed by the users. There are dozens of new TL functions
covering tree manipulation, graphic display and numer-
ical computations. In particular, there is now a large
collection of statistical distributions together with their
pdf’s, cdf’s, quantiles and random numbers.
Again, TREEFINDER is available on Windows, Linux
and MacOS X.
Cheers to all, Gangolf Jobb

Hi Claudia,
I don’t know of a software to do this. One way to
go would be to simulate data under your hypothesis
(i.e., population spacing, migration and mutation rate
etc...) using e.g. easypop ( http://www2.unil.ch/izea/-
softwares/easypop.html ) and to estimate the power
given your sample size by running many replicates.
As for a reference for which test of diﬀerentiation is
more powerful, see our paper in genetics (1996) that
you can download from

For k=2 and r=2 we can use the odds ratio as a statis-
tic and give it conﬁdence limits. For either one higher
it’s more diﬃcult, but I think the way to get a statistic
is to look at it as a contingency table. If there is no
association, then a chi-squared test would not be sig-
niﬁcant (this is an approximation to the Raymond and
Rousset test), and you can use the chi-squared value as
a statistic.
I would suggest something slightly diﬀerent. The chi-
squared is an approximation to a log-linear model. So,
what you could do is ﬁt a log-linear model with Haplo-
types and Populations as factors, and then you will get
a residual term (actually the Haplotypes x Population
interaction), which under the null hypothesis will have
a chi-squared distribution. Even if the null hypothesis
is false, it will have an approximately non-central chi-
squared distribution, so you can get conﬁdence limits
for that.
In practice, what you do is ﬁt a log-linear model with
Haplotypes and Populations as factors, and get the
residual deviance (call it D), and it’s degrees of free-
dom (which should be (k-1)(r-1), call it df). Then,
your point estimate is D, and the 95% conﬁdence lim-
its are C l*D/df and C u*D/df, where C l and C u are
the 2.5% and 97.5% points of a chi-squared distribution
with df degrees of freedom. You’ll have to ﬁnd both,
because the distribution is not symmetrical.
To interpret these, note that under the null hypothe-
sis the expected value of D/df is 1, so the further you
are away from 1, the stronger the association. I don’t64 EvolDir November 1, 2003
have any great feel for how far away is from 1 you have
to be to have an important eﬀect, but you could do
simulations and look at this statistic.
Things are getting complicated, aren’t they? It’s what
happens when biologists try to do statistics. :-(

Claudia,I dont know the exact test to which you refer,
but a full proof, if time consuming way to generate the
power for any test is to generate random data with the
eﬀect size and variation that you wish to determine the
tests power to detect, and see if the test detects it. If
you repeat this say 1000 times, then the percentage of
times that you detect a diﬀerence is the power of the
test.as a simple example, imagine you wanted to deter-
mine the power of a t test to detect a diﬀerence of 5
mm, between two groups of 10 ﬁsh. Imagine also that
you have an estimate of the standard deviation of ﬁsh
size. You can then get a computer program to generate
two groups of random ﬁsh by drawing numbers at ran-
dom from normal distributions, with the appropriate
sd, but means that diﬀer by 5 mm. You then do a t
test to see if you can detect the diﬀerence. Repeat lots
of times for an estimate of power. Obviously it would
be better to get a computer program to automate the
whole process. Excel is pretty good for simpler kinds
of things. You will obviously need to come up with a
simulation that models the assumptions of the test that
y ou are interested in.However, depending on what the
editor has asked you to do, you might ﬁnd the attached
paper useful in avoiding it. It basically points out that
post hoc power analysis is a waste of time.Nick

TWO POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS STUDYING
THE EVOLUTIONARY CAUSES AND CONSE-
QUENCES OF RECOMBINATION IN Daphnia Indi-
ana University, BloomingtonNovember 1, 2003 EvolDir 67
Two postdoctoral positions are available to study one
of the biggest sets of unsolved issues in biology: The
Evolutionary Causes and Consequences of Recombina-
tion. Funded by an NSF FIBR grant, a multidisci-
plinary team of life scientists will exploit the power-
ful features of the model organism Daphnia, including
the soon-to-be-completed complete genomic sequence.
This system is ideally suited to our purpose, with pop-
ulations exhibiting divergent levels of recombination,
some populations having dispensed with sexual repro-
duction entirely, a well-understood ecology, accessible
genetics, ease of manipulation in the ﬁeld and labo-
ratory, and a historical dimension for analysis in the
form of ~200-years of revivable genotypes from lake sed-
iments. The team of 11 PIs at 6 institutions span the
ﬁelds of cell biology, ecology, evolutionary genetics, ge-
nomics, parasitology, and mathematics. Both postdoc-
toral positions will be carried out at Indiana University,
Bloomington.
Postdoctoral position 1: Evolutionary genet-
ics/genomics The successful applicant will be involved
in molecular evolutionary studies of the inﬂuence of re-
combination on the rate of mutation accumulation, the
spread of mobile elements, and on adaptive potential.
Skills in at least one, and ideally more, of the following
areas are necessary: population genetics, genomics,
and molecular biology. To apply, submit a CV, a
description of your background and interests, and
email contacts for three potential letters of recommen-
dation to: Michael Lynch at mlynch@bio.indiana.edu
or Department of Biology, Indiana University, 1001 E.
3rd St., Bloomington, IN 47405-3700.
Postdoctoral position 2: Functional genomics/genetics
The successful applicant will study the genetic path-
ways controlling sexual and asexual reproduction. This
will include functional genomic analyses using full tran-
scriptome microarrays of meiotic egg production, mei-
otic sperm production, parthenogenetic egg produc-
tion, and the pathway controlling meiotic versus amei-
otic egg production. Skills in at least one, and ide-
ally more, of the following areas are necessary: devel-
opmental genetics, molecular biology, and functional
genomics. To apply, submit a CV, a description of
your background and interests, and email contacts for
three potential letters of recommendation to: Justen

Jena EvolGenomics
Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Genomics
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the
Department of Genetics and Evolution at the Max-
Planck-Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena, Ger-
many.
This position is associated with a collaborative project
to examine the role of positive selection in the evolution
of recently duplicated and rapidly diverging genes in the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and close relatives.
We are currently focussing on genes potentially involved
in reproductive isolation, reponse to biotic stress and
genes of unknown function (orphan genes) that show
signatures of selection.
The work will involve the identiﬁcation of candidate
genes by computational mining of genome databases;
the isolation, sequencing and annotation BAC clones;
the expression analysis of genes and tests of evolution-
ary hypotheses using phylogenetic reconstruction and
tests of positive selection. A background is molecular
biology and molecular evolution is expected. An in-
terest in quantitative aspects of sequence analysis and
proﬁciency in a programming language (our favorite is
Python) is highly desired.
The Department of Genetics and Evolution of the
Max-Planck-Institute of Chemical Ecology ( http://-
www.ice.mpg.de/tmo/home/home en.htm ) provides an
excellent work environment with a modern genomics
and bioinformatics infrastructure and a critical mass of
scientists working on the interface of evolutionary and

Methodology, Analysis, and Software for the Human
Haplotype Map Project
The human haplotype map (HapMap) is a major
($100M) international collaborative eﬀort to catalogue
the patterns of genetic variation, and in particular
association and linkage disequilibrium, in the human
genome, through the genotyping of around a millionSNPs in each of three population samples. The scale
and nature of the data being generated raises novel and
challenging analytical questions, which will demand the
development of new methodology and software.
Several of the leading groups on the analytical side of
the project are based in the University of Oxford. The
Mathematical Genetics and Bioinformatics Group in
the Department of Statistics, and Professor Lon Car-
don’s group in the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human
Genetics, were two of three internationally to be funded
by the SNP Consortium to work on HapMap analysis.
Three postdoctoral positions are available, each of two
years’ duration, to work on the development of analyt-
ical methods, and their application to the data being
generated by the project. Successful candidates may
start immediately, or at a mutually agreed date. Two
of the advertised positions will be based in the Don-
nelly and McVean groups, within the Department of
Statistics, the third in the Cardon group in the Well-
come Trust Centre for Human Genetics. There are close
collaborative links between these groups, in general and
over HapMap, and between them the University has one
of the largest centres internationally for human popu-
lation genetics modelling.
Applications for the PDRA posts are invited from re-
searchers interested in working on this high-impact
project: one of major importance in modern genetics.
Candidates should have relevant background research
experience in quantitative and statistical modelling.
Experience in modern computationally-intensive statis-
tical methods, and/or in population genetics, would be
an advantage, as would background knowledge of genet-
ics, though neither is essential for candidates committed
to moving into the ﬁeld.
We are also seeking a Scientiﬁc Programmer who will
work in the Donnelly and McVean groups, in close
collaboration with the modellers, to develop software
for implementing novel analytical tools. Experience in
C++ and/or Java is required. We envisage the post
holder as having a central role in the scientiﬁc develop-
ment of the project.
Well-qualiﬁed successful applicants for the four posts
are likely to be appointed at or near the top of the
respective salary scales given above.
Applications should comprise a CV and a list of publica-
tions together with the names, addresses, telephone, fax

Behavioural mechanisms of host manipulation by acan-
thocephalan parasites
The post-doc will be involved in an ongoing study on
the relationship between infection, altered behaviour,
and the modulation of some neurotransmitters using
acanthocephalan parasites and their crustacean inter-
mediate hosts as a model study. Various species of
acanthocephalan parasites exploit species belonging to
the genus Gammarus (Crustacea, Amphipoda) as inter-
mediate hosts. Some of these parasites are able to alter
host behaviour (photactism, geotactism) in ways that
apparently enhance transmission to the parasite’s ﬁnal
host. However, the ability to “manipulate” host be-
haviour varies between host-parasite interactions. The
aim of the project is to determine whether the altered
behaviour of infected hosts correlates with modiﬁca-
tions of speciﬁc brain regions together with altered pat-
terns of neurotransmitters including serotonin. Train-
ing in Animal Behaviour and/or Neuroethology will be
prefered. Applicants should have obtained their PhD

where. This course will provide students with 1) the
conﬁdence and skills to identify the major ant genera
of Latin America; 2) an understanding of modern spec-
imen processing and curation techniques; 3) an appre-
ciation for the biological diversity of ants, and 4) expe-
rience keying to the species level.
SPONSORS. California Academy of Sciences and Mu-
seum of Comparative Zoology, with funding from The
E.O. Wilson Foundation.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION. ANT COURSE
will be taught from August 5 - 15, 2004 at the
La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica ( http://-
www.ots.duke.edu/en/laselva/ ). The Station is cen-
tered amid the rich lowland Neotropical ant fauna.
PARTICIPANT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. ANT
COURSE is open to all interested individuals. Pri-
ority will be given to those biologists for whom the
course will have a signiﬁcant impact on their research.
An entomological background is not required. We aim
to include students with a diverse interest in biology,
including ant systematics, ecology, behavioral biology
and conservation. The high instructor to student ra-
tio will allow students to receive individual attention.
ANT COURSE is presented in English but many of the
instructors speak Spanish. The course is limited to 25
participants

sor Richard Nichols (QMUL)
Places may be limited. Please email
C.J.Foreman@qmul.ac.uk to book your place.
The meeting is designed to promote synergy betweengroups working at diﬀerent organisational levels rang-
ing from the analysis of DNA sequences to morpholog-
ical evolution.
HMM/Bayesian approaches to identifying control re-
gions from sequence data analysis of microarray data
modelling of regulatory networks evolution of develop-
ment and consequences for morphological evolution.
The idea is that we tantalisingly close to the point
where these ﬁelds will join together to make a coherent
account of evolution from the genotype to the pheno-
type. We hope that the meeting will identify possibili-
ties and impediments.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
