tributions will be selected by the chair of each session
to be presented as short oral communications to form a
basis for the discussions. There are two invited lectures.
Robert Trivers (Rutgers University, USA) will give an
opening lecture on Selﬁsh Genetic Elements, and Hans
de Jong (Wageningen University, The Netherlands) a=
talk on “B-chromosomes and related cytogenetic hob-
bies - discussions about the B-chromosome concept”.
Registration should be performed before 29 February
by ﬁlling in
the information requested in the conference web page
(http://www.bchromosomes.org/ ). The FULLY IN-
CLUSIVE registration fee of 360
is outstanding value, and will include: full board ac-
commodation from Saturday afternoon (June 26) to
Tuesday (June 29), entry to all scientiﬁc
sessions, abstract book, coﬀees, welcome reception, a
special closing dinner, and the bus mentioned above.
Late registration, after 29 February,

sists of villas with one or two double rooms. There are
also a limited number of single rooms which carry an
additional charge of 92 . Some of you will recall that it
will just over a decade since the
highly successful B1CC was held in Miraﬂores de la
Sierra (Madrid) in September 1993, and we anticipate
a lot of news of advances in knowledge and new ideas
over this period of time, as well as many new and en-
thusiastic B-faces. It is also appropriate that B2CC will6 EvolDir March 1, 2004
coincide with
the imminent publication of the “B Chromosomes in
Eukaryote Genomes” as a special edition of the journal
Cytogenetic and Genome Research. We very much look
forward to seeing you in Granada in June.

4th International Workshop on Antigen Processing and
Presentation
September 16 - 19, 2004 The Jackson Laboratory Bar
Harbor, Maine
This meeting will emphasize the structural and bio-
chemical basis for antigen processing and presentation,
as well as the receptors involved in innate and adaptive
immune recognition. A special session will be dedicated
to interactions of the immune system and pathogens. In
addition, two sessions will cover the topics of physiol-
ogy of the antigen presenting cells with an emphasis on
their function in vivo, and on the physiology of the T
cell responses to antigen stimulation. The particular
emphasis will be on the studies of the structural and
biochemical basis for antigen processing and presenta-
tion as well as on the receptors involved in innate and
adaptive immune recognition. To allow for intense dis-
cussions and exchange of ideas and results in the most
informal setting, the meeting will be limited to 100-
135 participants consisting of invited speakers, estab-
lished investigators, post-doctoral fellows and graduate
students. Postdoctoral and graduate students are en-
couraged to attend. This meeting has been held every
two years since 1994 and continues to be unique and
productive.
Topics include: Structure and function of molecules
involved in immune recognition Assembly of MHC
molecules and generation of MHC ligands Antigen pre-
sentation in vivo and APC Pathogen recognition by
immune system MHC/TCR interactions in T cell phys-
iology

Complex Trait Consortium 2004, 3rd Annual Confer-

bor, Maine
The goal of the Complex Trait Consortium (CTC) con-
ference is to bring together investigators who have com-
mon interest in the development and use of the labora-
tory mouse as a genetic tool for understanding human
health and disease.
Our speciﬁc goals are to increase the visibility of
complex traits in contemporary biomedical research
through: 1) Improved awareness and appreciation for
the natural variation that exists within species and
is responsible for signiﬁcant phenotypic variation. 2)
Recognition by the broader community of scientists
that the vast majority of human phenotypes have com-
plex multigenic components whose contributions need
to be understood to obtain comprehensive understand-
ing of relevant human phenotypes. 3) Acceptance that
the environment, through complex interactions with
genetic variation, is a critical determinant of pheno-
typic diversity. 4)Development of community-wide re-
sources that enable eﬃcient experimental dissection of
the causes of phenotypic diversity. Postdoctoral and
graduate students are encouraged to attend.March 1, 2004 EvolDir 7

/www.isbe2004.com/ We welcome you to the 10th
Congress of International Society for Behavioral Ecol-
ogy. The congress will cover a wide variety of topics,
as illustrated by our choice of plenary and Hamilton
lecture speakers.
Hamilton lecture: Mary Jane West-Eberhard. Plenary
speakers include: Manfred Milinski, Josephine Pem-
berton, Vladimir Pravosudov, Barry Sinervo, Liselotte
Sundstr¨ om, William Sutherland, Fritz Vollrath, Chris-
ter Wiklund.
The goal of the ISBE meetings has always been to allow
the latest developments and results to be presented in
a minimally formal context. Thus, we do not have any
speciﬁc symposia for talks, rather we expect researchers
to come with their latest ideas and results that can be
ﬁtted as oral and poster presentations into the program.
Registration to the congress is now open, and we invite
abstracts for posters and talks. Deadline for abstract
submission is 29th February 2004.

most biodiverse areas, but little is known about their
history. Molecular phylogenies oﬀer a new means of
dating the origin of plant taxa that form the structural
framework of these ecosystems. This meeting will dis-
cuss the theoretical background to dating phylogenies
and place insights from calibrated plant phylogenies in
a palaeobotanical and ecological context. Organised
by Dr Toby Pennington, Dr Quentin Cronk and Dr
James Richardson Speakers include: Mike Sanderson,

Public Lecture
Amazonian rainforests: thriving or surviving in a 21st
century atmosphere?
Monday 15 March 2003 at 6:30pm
When not writing up his research, Royal Society Fel-
low Yadvinder Malhi spends much of his time trekking
through the rainforests of South America in search of
answers to some of the most important issues aﬀect-
ing our environment: Will trees grow faster and absorb
some of the extra carbon dioxide human industries are
generating, for example, and how will this aﬀect bio-
diversity? In this talk Yadvinder will describe his re-
search and its importance in helping us to better un-
derstand global climate change.
Admission Free - no ticket or advance booking re-
quired. Further information and registration de-
tails can be found on the Royal Society website

Dear colleague,
The Internet service in the University of Granada will
have some problems during 18-23 February, so that the
web page for the Second B Chromosome Conference
(http://www.bchromosomes.org ) might not be accessi-
ble during this period. For this reason, we have decided
to extend the registration deadline till 8 march. The re-
maining deadlines are not modiﬁed.

UPuertoRico Lepidoptera Apr16-19
A meeting will be held at the University of Puerto
Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico from April 16-19, focusing
on the Evolution and Development in the Lepidoptera.
Most of the emphasis will be on wing pattern evolution
and/or development, but other talks will focus on evo-
devo of other morphological characters or life histories.
We are expecting a small and intimate meeting that will
provide plenty of opportunity for interactions outside of
a formal talk schedule. A visit to a natural park with
plenty of butterﬂies, south of San Juan, is also being
planned. Accommodations will be in a single or shared
room in downtown San Juan and will cost around $100
per night. We are currently looking into reserving a
block of rooms close to the University. In addition there
will be a small registration fee (approximately $50) to
cover transportation and entertainment.
If you want to attend the meeting please send us a title
for your talk.
We encourage meeting participants to arrive on Friday,
April 16 before dinner. Talks will be held the whole
day Saturday and Sunday morning, and the visit to the
natural park will be scheduled for Sunday afternoon.
Plan your return for Monday, or stay a few extra daysto enjoy San Juan or the surroundings.

Australia 2 Bioinformatics
Dear all,
Can I please ask you to draw to the attention of poten-
tial candidates the following two Australian PhD Schol-
arships?
All the best,
Lars
—— Two PhD Scholarships in Bioinformatics (one in
Comparative Genomics and one in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy)
Two PhD scholarships are available for suitably quali-
ﬁed candidates with good Honours degrees in biology,
mathematics, statistics, computer science, computa-
tional science or physics to undertake full-time research
leading to PhDs in Comparative Genomics and Evolu-
tionary Biology. The aim of the research is to retrace
the early evolution of animals through development and
use of new phylogenetic tools and data. The success-ful applicants will be part of a research team from the
University of Sydney and the University of Adelaide,
but will be aﬃliated with only one of these institutions
(i.e., one in Adelaide and the other in Sydney).
The Sydney-based student will be developing bioinfor-
matics tools for phylogenetic analyses of whole genomes
and will be analysing data from completely sequenced
mitochondrial genomes of animals within an evolution-
ary context. S/he must have a good grasp on computer
science and/or statistics, and a keen interest in devel-
oping maximum-likelihood programs that employ the
latest techniques in high-performance (or grid) com-
puting. Programming skills are essential and a broad
knowledge of evolutionary biology is desirable.
The Adelaide-based student will be collecting and
analysing morphological and developmental data from
previous broad-scaled phylogenetic studies, as well as
generating new observations and data. S/he must
have a good grasp of animal morphology and system-
atics, and a keen interest in using computers to study
morphological and developmental information obtained
from animals. Experience in various microscopy tech-
niques will be an advantage.
The PhD scholarships are funded via a grant from the12 EvolDir March 1, 2004
Australian Research Council, and are valued at $18,484
per annum (tax exempt, and indexed annually); they
may be renewed for up to three (3) years, subject to
satisfactory progress. In addition, relocation allowance
may be provided in certain circumstances. Applicants
must be citizens or permanent residents of Australia,
or citizens of New Zealand. International students can
also apply but they will be expected to cover their own
tuition fees.
Further information can be obtained from Dr Lars
S Jermiin, School of Biological Sciences (A08),
The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia
(Phone: +61-2-9351-3717; Fax: +61-2-9351-4119 E-
mail: lsj@bio.usyd.edu.au) or Dr Greg W Rouse, The

8207-7222; E-mail: rouse.greg@saugov.sa.gov.au. Ap-
plications for the position at The University of Sydney
should be sent directly to Dr Jermiin at the above ad-
dress and should include a Curriculum Vitae, a copy
of an academic transcript, and the names and contact
details of at least two referees. Applications for the
position at The University of Adelaide should be sent
directly to Dr Rouse at the above address and should
include a Curriculum Vitae, a copy of an academic tran-
script, and the names and contact details of at least two
referees.
Closing Date: March 1, 2004
This data gives us time to go through the applications
and call for referee reports - we aim at making oﬀers on
March 12, to give the students time to enrol (deadline
is March 31, 2004).

LundU AnimalMigration
Dear All,
We would like to advertise an international PhD stu-
dent course on the topic “The Ecology of Animal Migra-
tion” which will be held at the Department of Animal
Ecology, Lund University, in Sweden 14-23 April 2004.
The tentative program of the course is exposed at the
Bird Migration Group home page (see address below),
and include a large number of lectures of international
experts in the ﬁelds Locomotion, Orientation and Nav-
igation, Ecophysiology, Genetics of migration, Migra-
tion patterns and Modelling migration. There will be
ample time for discussions, presentations of own work,
excursion and own projects trying various methods used
to study migration during the course. To cover part of
the costs for the course we will have to take a course
fee of 2000 SEK, which will be paid upon arrival. The
logistics and food will have to be paid by the students,
but we can help to arrange for low cost rooms with
kitchen available.
If you are interested to attend the course,
please contact Rachel Muheim (Email:
Rachel.Muheim@zooekol.lu.se).
We would be most grateful if you, please, could spread
the word to your students or other interested persons.
We very much hope the course will be as successful as
it has been the previous two times we have given it
here in Lund, when students from 9 and 11 countries
participated.

RECOMBINATION-INDUCED MUTATIONAL
EVENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON GENOMIC
EVOLUTION
Meiotic recombination is one of the major forces shap-
ing genomic evolution. Recombination can break up
linkage disequilibrium, thereby allowing selection to act
on small genomic regions rather than on whole chro-
mosomes. What has received comparatively little at-
tention is the mechanistic impact recombination has on
chromosomes.
There is accumulating evidence that recombination can
cause a range of mutational events. In addition, re-
combination is implicated in the expansion of repeti-
tive sequences, and it is possible that it also plays a
role in the generation of gene duplications. Finally,
it appears likely that recombination-associated double
strand breaks may also induce inversions.
Except for some studies that examined the distribu-
tion of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, no systematic
analyses of these issues have been performed to date.
In particular, it is currently unclear how much recombi-
nation contributes to the genomic incidence of regional
duplications and inversions. A range of genomic pat-
terns (e.g., nucleotide diversity, codon usage bias, or
the clustering of essential genes) have been associated
with recombination. These have mostly been inter-
preted within the framework of Hill-Robertson eﬀects.
Can they alternatively be explained by recombination-
induced mutational eﬀects?
The Ph.D. candidate will examine these issues, using
publicly available data and a combination of computa-
tional and theoretical methods. The results will con-
tribute substantially to our understanding of the pro-
cesses that have shaped the evolution of eukaryotic
genomes.
This project is funded by the BBSRC, including a 2000
GBP studentship enhancement. Fees-only support will
also be available to EU citizens; unfortunately, no sup-
port can be oﬀered to anyone outside Europe.16 EvolDir March 1, 2004

Male stalk-eyed ﬂies have greatly exaggerated eyespans
which are sexually attractive to females. We are using
stalk-eyed ﬂies to investigate: a) the genetic and devel-
opmental basis of male eyespan and its use as a signal
of male genetic quality and as a signal of male repro-
ductive ability, b) the molecular genetic basis of male
ejaculate proteins, their role in sexual conﬂict at repro-

and females, and across a range of species varying in
eyespan exaggeration and sexual dimorphism.
The Studentship holder will be trained in modern
molecular genetic and developmental techniques ap-
plied to evolutionary questions. The Phd student

3 PhD positions in Theoretical Biology at the Univer-
sity of Groningen, the Netherlands
Project 1. Self-organization of social behaviour in ani-
mal societies
In models of artiﬁcial societies it has been shown that
complex social behaviour may arise from simple in-
teractions between individuals and their environment
by self-organization. The PhD project addresses all
kinds of social behaviour in animal societies (in par-
ticular of primates) ranging from coalition strategies,
reconciliation behaviour, exchange strategies, maternal
styles to migratory behaviour. The aim is to study
whether we can explain such complex social phenomena
by self-organization. The primary methods are simula-
tion models in which artiﬁcial individuals are supplied
with behavioural rules and social phenomena are stud-
ied at the level of relationships and of the group. Be-
havioural rules of various degrees of complexity will be
implemented to examine their relation to patterns at a
group level. Using this procedure it will also be investi-
gated to what extend such social phenomena may arise
as emergent properties from the interactions among the18 EvolDir March 1, 2004
individuals and environmental characteristics, such as
the distribution of food, the degree of predator pres-
sure, and the competitive regime.

A PhD position is available beginning April 1, 2004 in
the group of Henrik Kaessmann at the recently founded
Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lau-
sanne, Switzerland.
Currently we focus on the origin and evolution of pri-
mate genes and gene structures. New genes origi-
nate through various molecular mechanisms such as
the classic mechanisms of gene duplication (e.g. tan-
dem gene duplication), gene copying by retroposition,
exon/domain shuﬄing, and gene fusion. We pursue
several projects that aim to shed light on the rela-
tive importance of these mechanisms in generating pri-
mate genes. We are particularly interested in char-
acterizing the (adaptive) evolution of young genes in
the human genome that originated recently on the pri-
mate lineage and therefore may be relevant in regard
to human/hominoid-speciﬁc phenotypes. To this end,
we explore available data from genomic databases and
generate complementary data by experimental analysis.

ation in wing patterns. The vivid wing patterns of this
species are adaptations that warn potential predators
of the butterﬂies’ unpalatability. Ongoing research is
utilizing genomic technologies (high-resolution genetic
mapping and gene expression data) to study the devel-
opmental and genetic architecture of this extraordinary
evolutionary radiation.
Conservation and Population Biology: The student will
join an active conservation genetics group that utilizes
powerful molecular genetic techniques to address ques-
tions about the ecology of endangered or threatened
tropical organisms. Ongoing projects include genetic
and ecological research on i) reproductive and popu-
lation biology of hawksbill turtles ii) territoriality and
reproductive behavior of the Mona rock iguana, and
iii) population persistence, reproductive success, and
gene ﬂow in a riparian orchid metapopulation. Stu-
dent research is not restricted to ongoing projects and
there are ample opportunities to develop independent
projects, particularly relating to the management andconservation of coral reef organisms.
About the University: Located in San Juan, the Uni-
versity of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras (UPR-RP) is the
oldest and largest campus of the UPR system. UPR-
RP has a rich history of teaching and research ex-
cellence. The University possesses all essential core
infrastructure for state-of-the-art genetic/genomic re-
search. This fact, coupled with the University’s prox-
imity to tropical marine and terrestrial habitat and
strong links with Central and South America means
that UPR-RP is positioned to become a prominent re-
search center in tropical ecology and evolution. Span-
ish is the major language of the island, but English is
also widely spoken. Students are encouraged to be-
come ﬂuent in both languages. Please see http://-

The evolutionary genetics of song in ﬂies; from QTL to
candidate gene.
ONLY AVAILABLE FOR UK CITIZENS, I’M
AFRAID.
A PhD studentship is available at the University of
St Andrews for a joint project between the labora-
tories of Prof. M. G. Ritchie (St Andrews) and Dr
Stephen Goodwin (University of Glasgow). The aims
of the project are to combine an evolutionary approach
to the evolution of song diﬀerences amongst species
of Drosophila with molecular and neurogenetic ap-
proaches to behaviour genetics. Quantitative Trait Loci
approaches have identiﬁed chromosomal regions impli-
cated in the evolution of species-speciﬁc song traits
important to speciation. Candidate genes previously22 EvolDir March 1, 2004
known to inﬂuence song are implicated in some of
these regions. The student will assess the role of can-
didate genes directly using modern behaviour genetic
techniques such as gene knockout or transfer between
species and the molecular evolution of the genes will be
analysed by sequence analysis. This project has the po-
tential to provide breakthroughs in the understanding
of the genetics of species diﬀerences in behaviour. Fur-
ther details available by e-mailing mgr@st-and.ac.uk or

3 Graduate student positions available.
I am looking for students to start work on three funded
projects at the MSc and PhD levels. The projects in-
clude;
1) Darter conservation genetics (MSc or PhD): De-
velop and apply microsatellite markers to a system of
fragmented and introduced populations of the green-
side darter in Southwestern Ontario. The analysis will
concentrate on metapopulation dynamics in the frag-
mented populations, and on founder eﬀects in the in-
troduced populations. The student will work with the
Canadian Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans in the ﬁeld, anddo the lab work at the Great Lakes Institute for En-
vironmental Research (U Windsor, ON). Applications
of the technique will also be possible in the threatened
Eastern Sand Darter.
2) Population structure in hybridizing marine mussels
(MSc or PhD): Mussels in the 3 sibling species in the
genus Mytilus hybridize widely. Hybrid zones have
been described on both the west and east coasts of
Canada. Recently developed microsatellite markers,
combined with diagnostic species markers, will be used
to determine the eﬀect of hybridization on population
structure and dynamics. Molecular methods will be
used to estimate the role of selection against hybrids in
both hybrid zones. The student will use archived sam-
ples, as well as travel to one or both coasts to perform
in situ experiments and collect samples.
3) Adaptation at the gene transcription level in wall-
eye and Chinook salmon (PhD): Both walleye and Chi-
nook salmon are known to exhibit extreme life history
variation among populations. This project will address
the genetic basis of this variation using neutral genetic
markers to estimate additive genetic variance for life
history traits, as well as RT-PCR and DNA microarray
techniques to assess diﬀerences in gene transcription
levels in feral populations exhibiting life history trait
variation..

specialize in functional genomics and its applications34 EvolDir March 1, 2004
to ecological issues (i.e., ecological genomics). The sci-
entist will perform laboratory and ﬁeld research in ge-
nomics to expand current genetics and ecological ex-
pertise at LSC. The successful applicant is expected to
identify and investigate the function and expression of
ecologically important genes in species in need of con-
servation. The scientist will apply genomics investiga-
tions to ongoing studies in population genetics, phy-
logeography, and molecular systematics currently con-
ducted by the branch. The scientist will also inter-
act with ecologists in the Aquatic Ecology Branch, and
with microbial geneticists, molecular biologists, and
others at LSC. This interaction is expected to shed light
on the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes
by understanding the associated genetic and environ-
mental interactions that aﬀect individual ﬁtness. An-
other line of productive research could extrapolate or-
ganismal biology to population and species evolution to
test how regulatory gene networks evolve and how they
diﬀer among populations of closely related species.

AFM microdissection
Dear members:
We are trying to set up the LMM-LPC technique in our
group to amplify DNA from single bands in Drosophila
polytene chromosomes. We have been using PALM
technology with an Olympus microdissection system,
but found some problems related to adapt polytene
squash technique on LMPC-membrane slides. Pre-
cisely, we ﬁnd that, when dissected salivary glands are
squashed on top of membrane slide by applying pres-
sure on the
cover slide, the membrane becomes impregnated by
the squashing solution that contains acetic and lac-
tic acids, producing a rugged surface that impairs the
chromosome spreading and their microscopic observa-
tion. Could you suggest a way to avoid this inconve-
nience? Also, after cover slide is taken oﬀ, slides are
dehydrated with ethanol which gets under the mem-
brane and leaves air bubbles after ethanol dries up. We
are following our in situ hybridisation protocol to make
polytene spreads, but I wonder whether other proto-
cols suit best the laser-based microdissection. Could
you give us a reference of somebody that has succeed
in polytene band microdissection?
We have tried to do LMM-LPC microdissection on
slides without membrane and found that we have to
apply multiple laser shots to catapult most of
the polytene band. Doing this we are never sure the we
recover the whole
band and, most important, we are afraid that DNA
could be fragmented into pieces too small for our pur-
poses (we need to amplify a minimun of 5 kbs). Is
there a way to adjust the focus of the laser to improve
catapulting or, we really need to make the spread on
the membrane? A ﬁnal question that intrigues us is
whether such small ammounts of DNA
(contents of a band ranges from 50 to 150 DNA kilo-
bases) are suﬃcient to PCR ampliﬁcation.
I am addressing you in the hope that you will be able
to guide us to solve our problems. May be you know
of somebody that is using this technique to microdis-
sect polytene chromosomes. Hope to hear from you
soon and thank you in advance for your help. Sincerely,

AMOVA question answers
Dear Evoldir members,
Several weeks ago I posted a question about AMOVA
on Evoldir. I have received several answers and several
requests for a synopsis, which are included here. Thank
you very much.
Yours sincerely, Miriam Richards
>My question is, am I correct that more complicated,
multilevel AMOVA >models have >not been derived?
Or if they have, could somebody steer me in the right
>direction? A colleague and I intend to derive the mod-
els if this has not >been done previously, but we don’t
want to reinvent the wheel.
1. These analysis of variance “models” have certainly
been implemented before, and I guess some statistical
packages could certainly handle such additional levels
in the hierarchy. However, they do not use molecular
distances, but the principles would be exactly the same
regarding degrees of freedom. Implementing it your-
self would certainly require some major programming
eﬀorts. I think the software GDA incorporates one ad-
ditional level in the hierarchy compared to that imple-
mented in Arlequin. Also be careful that by including
many levels in the hierarchy, the degrees of freedom can
become quite small, and you would need quite a lot of
samples to get signiﬁcant results.
2. you can simply use the three level analysis to get
what you want, if you reorganise your data between
runs. E.g., ﬁrst you do country, region, and within
region, then you do region, subpop, and family, and
ﬁnally you do subpop, family, and individuals. This
should serve the purpose, although you will realize that
between runs the partitioning may deviate by few tenth
of percents.
PS I did that with plants between regions, populations,
subpopulations, and individuals, and had no problems
to publish.
3. Amova is just like Anova with respect to models.
The sums of squares decompositions can be set up in
the same way, whatever the model. To my knowledge,
software for nested models for 3 levels are all that is
generally available. I have myself, on special occasions,38 EvolDir March 1, 2004
worked out cross-classiﬁed models and 4-level nests, on
a ´ one-oﬀ basis, as needed, and virtually anything is pos-
sible, but I doubt that generic software exists for more
than the 3’level nest. There never seemed to be much
point in reinventing SAS.
4. The program GDA, available from Paul Lewis
(http://lewis.eeb.uconn.edu/lewishome ) at least comes
closer to what you want, as it will handle 4 levels of hi-
erarchy for F-statistics if I am not mistaken. The mod-
els for adding additional levels of hierarchy are really
just extensions of the simpler models in a hierarchical
ANOVA-like structure – see Bruce Weir’s Genetic Data
Analysis II textbook (1996, Sinauer) for an explanation.
As I see it, the downside of having so many levels of hi-
erarchy in your analysis might be a lack of precision for
the F-statistic estimates at the various levels unless you
have a huge data set. Anyway, good luck!!

DNA from pleopods
Does anybody out there have a technique to isolate to-
tal genomic DNA from ethanol preserved pleopods of
freshwater crayﬁsh? We are trying to get enough DNA
from one pleopod (this is all we have to work with -
about 1 - 1.5 cm long) to be able to PCR amplify mul-
tiple gene regions.
Note that some of the pleopod samples are quite old
(up to 100 years), and that there seems to be a PCR
inhibitor in the extracts trialled so far, perhaps this is
from the pigment in the exoskeleton.
Thank you in advance.

Evol questions peer instruction
A physicist friend loaned me a book called “Peer In-
struction: a User’s Manual” by Eric Mazur. It de-
scribes an interactive, concept-based method of teach-
ing physics, complete with hundreds of concept ques-
tions that could be asked during lecture. Does anyone
have a similar bank of questions for the teaching of ge-
netics and evolution?
The questions are multiple choice, but complicated and
diﬃcult enough that most students beneﬁt from talk-
ing to the students around them to understand the an-
swer. The idea is that the instructor projects the ques-tion and the students hold up a card indicating what
they think is the right answer (“A, B, C, or D”). Stu-
dents then turn to 3-4 of the students around them to
talk about the question for several minutes. Then they
“vote” again. What Mazur ﬁnds is that the students
who know the answer are quite convincing in their ex-
planations and teach their peers how to think about
the question. Those who had the wrong answer ini-
tially usually had weaker arguments supporting their
decision and were likely to change their answer on the
second round of voting.
I want to try this technique in my Genetics and Evolu-
tion course, a course for ﬁrst-year biology majors that
enrolls about 80 students per semester.

Freqpars format
I am having diﬃculty converting my nuclear SNP fre-
quencies into the “freqpars” ﬁle format. It looks like
most people using frequency parsimony are starting
with a BIOSYS ﬁle and using Swoﬀords BIO2frq pro-
gram in the FREQPARS package to convert it to a
freqpars ﬁle format. This can then be imported into
PAUP* to generate the appropriate matrices for fre-
quency parsimony. It appears BIOSYS-2 is no longer
available from the ftp site at Colorado State. Is there
an alternative program to generate the freqpars format
or can someone explain what line 4 in the freqpars ﬁle
format is for (e.g. 6A,5F4.2)?
Thank you,

GCrich sequencing
Dear All, I am having trouble for sequencing highly
G+C rich PCR products of nuclear ITS rDNA genes,
using the BigDye ABI chemistry.
Basically, the sequences start very nicely, with high and
distinct peaks, and suddendly crash after a string of
GGGGGGGGCCC. I am not sure if this is only due to
the high GC content, or also to the secondary structure
that ITS fragment can take. I tried a GC-buﬀer from
Invitrogen, I tried diﬀerent concentrations of DMSO, I
tried to increase temperature for the extension-step(up
to 72 deg, rather than the suggested 60). Without suc-
cess.
I would appreciate a lot any advices, suggestions, on
this matter, Many thanks in advance, Best Regards

GeneConcepts survey
Changes in our understanding of the structure and
function of genes have occurred through the concept’s
one hundred year history but have accelerated rapidly
in recent years. The Representing Genes project,
funded by NSF, is an interdisciplinary group of re-
searchers examining the current status of the concept
and how researchers in diﬀerent ﬁelds have reconceived
it to meet their particular needs. We aim to gather
the views of the widest possible range of biological re-
searchers and ask for your assistance in completing a
web-based survey based on a series on intriguing cases
in contemporary genomics. Please take the opportunity
to be part of this project.
The survey is posted at: http://-
surveyweb.ucsur.pitt.edu/sw/wchost.asp?st=gene
and will remain accessible through the end of March.
Although survey responses are anonymous there is an
opportunity to request an information package of an-
notated bibliographies on the cases mentioned in the
questionnaire, and to request notiﬁcation of the pub-
lished results in due course.Please report any diﬃculties to the researchers:

Genome walking answers
Dear colleagues,
Here are all the replies to the Genome walking question
that I asked last year. Sorry for the delay in posting
this reply, but I wanted to have time to trial the kit!
I ended up using the Sigma Vectorette System, with
some success.
A special “Thank you” to all those people that took the
time to reply to my email.
Kind regards, Adele
Original Email
Dear colleagues, I am studying metallothionein (MT)
genes that are involved in Heavy Metal responses in
mussels I have isolated some coding gene sequence(s)
and want to use a PCR based DNA walking method
to isolate the entire gene sequence(s) for use in popula-
tions surveys. Is there anyone out there who has used
the Invitrogen TOPO Walker Kit or SIGMA’s Univer-
sal Vectorette System who could give me some advice
as to their relative eﬀectiveness? Any other advice/kits
that could be useful?
Many thanks, Adele
Answers Summary
Clonetech
I have had repeated success with Clonetech (now BD-
Sciences, I think) Universal Genome Walker kit. I have
used this for several species (from mice to lizards) and42 EvolDir March 1, 2004
for many genes. For the most part, I followed the kit’s
instructions, but used annealing temperatures about 2
degrees lower than recommended and used 2X more
library (template) in the PCR reactions than recom-
mended. In my experience, success or failure relied
heavily on how good your gene-speciﬁc primers were.
I haven’t used either of the kits you mention, but have
used the Clontech Genome Walker kit for this purpose,
with good success.
I’ve been using the GeneWalker Kit - Clontech - to ob-
tain the complete sequence of the genes involved in the
carotenogenic pathway...until know the kit worked very
well and results are very good. Hope this is helpfull
and if you need more informations just ask me.
I have used the Universal GenomeWalker Kit from
Clontech (now BD Biosciences) and have, frankly, been
surprised at how well it works. Out of seven “walks”,
I have only had one failure (and that due to my faulty
primer design). I have been using it in plants (wild
beets), but it should be ﬁne for any uncharacterized
genome.
When I was deciding which was the best approach for
my work I considered both the Universal Vectorette
kit from SIGMA and the Universal GenomeWalker Kit
from Clontech. The kit from Sigma does not give any
information about linkers sequence while the Clontech
one is nicely explained in the manual and in a paper
from NAR (SIEBERT, P. D., CHENCHIK, A., KEL-
LOGG, D. E., LUKYANOV, K. A. and LUKYANOV,
S. A., 1995. An improved PCR method for walking in
uncloned genomic DNA. Nucleic Acids Res. 23: 1087-
1088). So I choose the Clontech kit, which has been
working very well, allowing 10kb genomic walkings in
several steps (typically 500 bp to 2500 bp each) and I
would recommend it.
Invitrogen TOPO
I have used TOPO walking and had success, though
this was quite variable. I suspect that it worked when
the kit was new, but then deteriorated. I bought three
kits in my life, and this always seemed to be the case.
I have heard others say similar things about the TOPA
TA cloning kit, so it could be a general thing with that
enzyme. I haven’t used the vectorette system, but some
people here swear by it. I suggest trying that.
I have used the TOPO kit - it works ﬁne but it gener-
ally only gives you about 1-2 kb long fragments. If you
gene is long, you will have to do a lot of walking and
end up designing/ordering many primers.

ing sequence GENE 284 (1-2): 125-131 FEB 6 2002 It

Genomes to sequence
Dear Colleagues,
John Gerhart and I are chairing an NHGRI working
group on Comparative Genome Evolution to make rec-
ommendations for genome sequencing targets. There is
information on the new program posted at:
http://www.genome.gov/10002189 This working
group will address the acquisition of new genomic
sequences for one or more of three main purposes: 1)
the provision of sequence from critical phylogenetic
positions, for example to illuminate the evolution
of major morphogenetic or physiological innovations
in evolution; 2) at a smaller evolutionary scale, the
provision of sequence from species that will allow
the optimal identiﬁcation of conserved functional
regions in the existing genome sequence of important
non-mammalian model systems; and 3) the provision
of information that addresses basic questions about
genome evolution such as evolutionary rates; speci-
ation; genome reorganization, origins of variation,
etc.
This program is intended to have a scope potentially
encompassing all organisms except plants, algae, eubac-
teria and archaea. This program is for consideration of
targets for large-scale genomic sequencing. Proposals
for EST sequencing, cDNA sequencing or the develop-
ment of other genomic resources will not be considered
by this procedure, but pilot sequencing may be possible
to justify the consideration of an organism.
We seek input from various research communities, and
we welcome nominations, supported by as much infor-
mation as you can provide in the attached spreadsheet
(columns and rows can be resized as needed to provide
ample space for text), or you can address the list of
questions appended at the bottom of this email. WeMarch 1, 2004 EvolDir 43
can consider some genomes very soon, since we will be
making our ﬁrst set of recommendations in early April.
This sequencing eﬀort will continue, and we are inter-
ested in knowing about candidate genomes for future
years, from organisms still needing preliminary work.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Dear colleagues, I am working on a comparative study
on life history aspects in ants and would like to have
information on the primary mono-/polygyny and/or

HighGC sequencing answers44 EvolDir March 1, 2004
Hello, some of you asked me to post the answers to my
question of last week:
“Dear All, I am having trouble for sequencing highly
G+C rich PCR products of nuclear ITS rDNA
genes, using the BigDye ABI chemistry. Basically,
the sequences start very nicely, with high and dis-
tinct peaks, and suddendly crash after a string of
GGGGGGGGCCC. I am not sure if this is only due to
the high GC content, or also to the secondary structure
that ITS fragment can take. I tried a GC-buﬀer from
Invitrogen, I tried diﬀerent concentrations of DMSO, I
tried to increase temperature for the extension-step(up
to 72 deg, rather than the suggested 60). Without suc-
cess. I would appreciate a lot any advices, suggestions,
on this matter, Many thanks in advance, Best Regards
Colomban”
HERE ARE THE ANSWERS I GOT:
Dear Colomban, This can always be tricky. Have you
tried heating up your reaction at 98oC for 10’ before
you start cycling? This should help by breaking up
any secondary structure that your DNA might have.
Hope this helps. Cheers, Anders. CERC Graduate Fel-

Dear Sir/Madam, Hello....the problem is really simple
and solution is very easy.I am getting a very good se-
quence with such region in ITS ,but initially it was a
hectic in the sense that I did Gradient pcr to get the
good pcr product,muct be intact product.Then proba-
bly you go for cloning the product in a suitable vector
and sequence it with the ﬂanking primers.You will get
full sequence with both the primers. Let me know if
there are any querries... best wishes, mahesh

Dear Colomban, are you sequencing cloned products?
Otherwise it sounds like you are running into the prob-
lem of variability between the two alleles, one of them
possibly being a few Gs shorter and therefore messing
up the rest of your sequence! Cheers, Christoph

Dear Colomban, Sequence your PCR product from the
other side. If you do not reach your desired region, you
would have to design new primers within the parts of
your PCR products that you can sequence. Good luck,
Natalia Martinkova
Dear Colomban, Not that I have a LOT of experience
with ABI sequences, but I heard recently that one can
add betaine to the BigDye sequencing reactions. I don’t
know if you were still in Steve’s lab when I promoted
the use of betaine as a magic PCR ingredient, and
it makes sense to me that it would improve cycle se-
quencing (especially of GC-rich regions) just as much.
In PCR I use 0.5 to 1 molar (!) betaine – may be worth
trying – good luck!
If the ITS regions are nuclear junky?, you may be trying
to directly sequence heterozygotic pcr products which
cannot be done! That is heterozyogotic in length, not
mutation!! One allele may be: GGGGGGGGCCC, and
the other may be GGGGGGGGCCC plus or minus any
other combination of miscellaneous bases. Just one ad-
ditional bp will do exactly what you describe in a se-
quencing run.
Fortunately, you can get around this problem by cloning
the pcr products and sequencing the separate alleles.
Many people I believe however, are just sequencing
from the other direction, but this is not a luxury you
can aﬀord if this phenomenon occurs throughout a spe-
ciﬁc sequence.
Good luck and keep me posted? Si Creer
Colomban,
Applied Biosystems has a GC rich sequencing solu-
tion for these issues. We used it when we were doing
our microsatellite libraries on organisms that had GC
rich genomes. If you need more information on prod-
uct/part number let me know and I can ﬁnd out, but
maybe try that out.

Journal cost 6
Several months ago there was a brief discussion of jour-
nal prices and the challenges faced by libraries. As a re-
sult, I thought readers of Evoldir might be interested inMarch 1, 2004 EvolDir 45
the resolution that appears below, which was adopted
on Monday by the University Senate at the University
of Connecticut.
Kent
***
Resolution
Access to the scholarly literature is vital to all mem-
bers of the academic community. Scholars and their
professional associations share a common interest in the
broadest possible dissemination of peer-reviewed contri-
butions. Unfortunately, the business practices of some
journals and journal publishers is inimical to these in-
terests and threatens to limit the promise of increased
access inherent in digital technologies. Development of
library collections is more and more constrained by the
rising costs of journals and databases. Faculty, staﬀ,
students, and university administrators must all take
greater responsibility for the scholarly communication
system.
Therefore, the University Senate calls on all faculty,
staﬀ, and students of the University of Connecticut to
become familiar with the business practices of journals
and journal publishers in their specialty. It especially
encourages senior tenured faculty to reduce their sup-
port of journals or publishers whose practices are incon-
sistent with the health of scholarly communication by
submitting fewer papers to such journals, by refereeing
fewer papers submitted to such journals, or by resign-
ing from editorial posts associated with such journals.
It encourages them to increase their support of existing
journals and publishers whose practices are consistent
with the health of scholarly communication.
The Senate also calls on University administrators and
departmental, school, college and University commit-
tees to reward eﬀorts by faculty, staﬀ, and students
to start or support more sustainable models for schol-
arly communication. It calls on them to provide ﬁnan-
cial and material support to faculty, staﬀ, and students
whose work helps to ensure broad access to the scholarly
literature. It also calls on professional associations and
the University to invest in the infrastructure necessary
to support new venues for peer-reviewed publication.
Finally, the Senate calls on the University Libraries to
provide resources that help faculty, staﬀ, and students
understand the business practices of diﬀerent journals
and journal publishers and their impact on the health
of scholarly communication.

ML distances

Does anybody know if ML distances between groups
(not pairwise comparison) are calculated using PAUP,
and how to perform them? If not, is there any other
program to do them? I only know that evolution-
ary distances between groups can be calculated in
Mega2, but there are only several simple models in
Mega2. I want to use more complicated models, for
example,GTR+I+G model.

NJ phylogenies
Hello Everyone,
If anyone could suggest a way to statistically compare a
neighbor joining tree built with genetic distances from
microsatellite frequency data to a constrained tree, I’d
be very grateful.
I know that NJ is not a likelihood method and I at least
cannot use PHYLIP to do such a comparison. Please
let me know if you know of a better method of creating
a tree from microsatellite data where such a comparison
may be possible, or whether there is software available
that may allow me to make the comparison regardless.
My populations are distant enough that signiﬁcant mu-
tation has occurred, so methods that ignore mutation
will probably not be useful.
Thanks! Ben Blackman bkblackm@indiana.edu

Linnean Soc. 70(4):613-632. Ross Crozier
Hello
In response to your post on the Evoldir: David Hillis
wrote a chapter in the book “Advances in molecu-
lar ecology” (1998, IOS Press, Amsterdam) about the
phyogenetic analysis of frequency data, such as al-
lozyme data, but of course that may also be appicable
to microsats. I do not know by heart if the method
is suitable for Likelihood analysis, so it may not be of
much use to you.
Good luck, Patrick Meirmans
Dear Ben I do not know what you want to do by com-
paring a NJ tree with a constrained tree. In most
cases, construction of an NJ tree with bootstrap values
gives suﬃcient information. This type of NJ trees can
easily be constructed from microsatellite data by us-
ing Takezaki’s program POPTREE or Ota’s DISPAN
for various distance measures. These two programs
are available from my website listed at the bottom of
this message. Have you read Takezaki and Nei’s Ge-
netics (1996) paper or Nei and Kumar’s book “Molec-
ular evolution and phylogenetics”, Oxford University
Press, 2000, about microsatellite data? Theoretically,
of course, it is possible to compare any pair of minimum
evolution topologies by using Rzhetsky and Nei’s (1993)
algorithm, and this can be done by using Rzhetsky and
Nei’s program ( CABIOS 10:409-412, 1994). However,
this requires a least-squares distance, and this distance
is not necessarily good for microsatellite data (see Nei
and Kumar’s book, chapter 13). All the papers and
softwares mentioned here are available from my website.March 1, 2004 EvolDir 47
You imply that ML trees are usually better than NJ
trees. This is a common misconception in systematics.
Actually both methods have advantages and disadvan-
tages, as was discussed in Nei-Kumar book. Masatoshi
Nei
Hi Ben,
If I understand your query to evoldir correctly, what
you want to do is determine whether a distance ma-
trix based on microsatellite frequency matches and is
consistent with a hypothetical matrix (a constrained
tree/relationship among taxa). Is that correct? If so,
people frequently use a Mantel’s test to test for indepen-
dence and lack of association between matrices. But by
’constrained tree’ you may mean something more spe-
ciﬁc. If there is a way to specify your constrained tree
as a nested hierarchy within a matrix, this may be one
way to go. Alex Buerkle
Dear Ben
I suggest the program Populations ( http:/-
/www.pge.cnrs-gif.fr/bioinfo/populations/-
index.php?lang=en ) I think that you can compare the
tree by bootstrap values...
Best regards
Paulo Russo
Onagraceae micros
Dear members,
Our lab is currently trying to develop a microsatellite li-
brary for Camissonia cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae), but
we are having some problems. Before the enrichment
phase, but after the digestion (with RsaI and BstUI
each) and linker ligation several highly concentrated
bands appear within the smear on a gel (6-10 bands
in the 500-1000bp region). The problem seems to be
that the genome has several highly repetitive elements
present, which obviously also contain enzyme cut sites.
Since these elements are appearing even prior to en-
richment we are concerned that this species might not
be a good candidate for microsatellite library develop-
ment as it would likely become heavily biased for these
repetitive elements.
Has anyone ever experienced this problem before? If so,
how did you handle it? More speciﬁcally, has anyone
had success (or not) with an Onagraceae species or had
a similar result?Any suggestions or advice on how to proceed would be
greatly appreciated.

Plato program help
Dear EvolDir members,
I am looking for help with a problem I encountered
when using the PLATO program.
The problem is like this: When I tried to run PLATO in
Mac Classic environment with my ﬁle containing both
the data and the ML tree in PHYLIP format, the pro-
gram prematurely aborted and the Classic environment
was shut oﬀ also. When I tried to run on Mac OS9, the
output window stayed open but the program stopped
at the beginning of the analysis and could not progress.
I checked my ﬁle a few times and it seemed to be all
right.
My questions are: 1. Has anyone experienced same or
similar problem? 2. What might be the cause of this
problem and how to solve it?
My data ﬁle can be sent if needed. Thanks a lot for
any help!

SSB awards
Mini-PEET Awards for Students, Postdocs or Faculty
to Enhance Transfer of Taxonomic Knowledge - SSB
is pleased to again announce the availability of four
awards to enhance the transfer of taxonomic expertise,
modeled after the highly successful PEET program at
NSF. Unlike the NSF PEET program, awards will not
be limited to taxonomically understudied taxa, since
the primary purpose is to pass on taxonomic expertise
in general. The awards are designed to allow SSB mem-
bers (students, post-docs, and faculty) to spend a sum-
mer or semester apprenticed to an expert in a particular
taxonomic group. This would support the PEET goal
of passing on taxonomic expertise before it is lost. This
could support either a trip for the applicant to the tax-
onomists’ laboratory, or supply funds to allow the ex-
pert taxonomist to visit the applicants’ laboratory for
a period of time. Requests for support may be in any
amount up to $4,000. The request should include a brief
description of the project, justiﬁcation of the impor-
tance of the taxon, and an itemized budget; the request
should be no more than two pages long, not including
the curriculum vitae. Requests should be sent to Dr.
Keith Crandall, Executive Vice President, SSB. E-mail
submissions can be sent to keith crandall@byu.edu or
Dr. Keith A. Crandall, 675 Widtsoe Building, Depart-
ment of Integrative Biology, Brigham Young University,
Provo, UT 84602-5181USA. Review of applications will
begin on April 1st 2004. Applicants should NOT be
from a laboratory group currently supported by an NSF
PEET award.
Scholarships and Travel Awards for Scientists from
Developing Countries to Obtain Modern Systematic
Training in the US - SSB is pleased to announce the
availability of four scholarships for scholars from de-
veloping countries to attend workshops and courses in
systematics, or to visit a molecular lab for training.
The emphasis of this program is the transfer of knowl-
edge to the scholar’s home country. This means that
the student should currently be in their home coun-
try, or have deﬁnite plans to return in the near future.
Courses such as the Molecular Evolution Workshop at
Woods Hole, the applied Systematics Course at Bodega
Bay, the Systematic Workshop at the Alan Wilson Cen-
ter, Massey University, New Zealand, are examples of
courses that are appropriate for this funding, in ad-dition to other equivalent opportunities. Support for
attending a course will be contingent on admission to
the course through the normal admissions process. A
letter expressing interest in support and a curriculum
vitae should be sent to Dr.Keith Crandall 675 Widtsoe
Building, Department of Integrative Biology, Brigham
Young University, Provo, UT 84602-5181USA; email-
keith crandall@byu.edu. The letter should include a
discussion of how the knowledge acquired will be trans-
ferred to the country of the scholar’s origin, and a jus-
tiﬁcation of the course itself as providing appropriate
training. Applications will be evaluated as they are
received.

SeqAlignment Editor
I’m looking for a good, simple and robust multiple se-

XP. I need software that will cope with large MSAs
(up to 1000 sequences) although it does not have to do
much more than allow rudimentary alignment editing.

Shipping Ecoli
Dear colleagues,
As part of an ongoing joint project between a Span-
ish and an US institution, we plan to ship petri dishes
containing solid media with growing colonies of com-
mercial strains of E. coli transformed with inserts from
cDNA libraries constructed in Spain, to the American
institution, for their screening and high-throughput se-
quencing. We would like to hear from other people with
experience in shipping this kind of material to the US
from Europe. We anticipate some issue with the US
customs service.
thank you for your help

SlopePermutation
Hi Everyone
I would be very grateful if anyone can suggest software
that will test by permutation the statistical diﬀerence
in slopes such as a pair of isolation-by-distance slopes
from comparable sample sets).
* The data are pairwise, so a permutation approach
of some kind is needed to overcome statistical non-
independence (and likely diﬀerent N contributing to
each slope).
* Permuting the diﬀerence in slope is not the same thing
as bootstrapping each slope to get SEs and seeing if
they overlap (e.g. this does not account for holes in the
data and diﬀerent N)
Bohonak’s IBD seems to do the latter.
It has been suggested that a new function in
GENEPOP 3.4 does what we want, but it does not
seem to.

Thanks to everyone who responded concerning permut-
ing slopes.
There were twice as many who wanted to know the an-
swer as those who had something to contribute to the
answer, so this is obviously an area of interest!50 EvolDir March 1, 2004
I have not checked out all the responses in detail yet,
so it remains to be seen if there is something here that
does what we want, but several look promising.
Thanks again Paul

Answers (in order that they were received):
(1) But a paired t-test does the same thing! You could
simply calculate the diﬀerence in slopes, and the associ-
ated standard error (which is just the denominator in a
paired t.test). If you have several of these slopes, then
you can put the diﬀerences into a weighted ANOVA to
get a single analysis.
>* Permuting the diﬀerence in slope is not the same
thing as >bootstrapping each slope to get SEs and
seeing if they overlap (e.g. >this does not account for
holes in the data and diﬀerent N) >But you could both
slopes boostrap simultaneously and use the diﬀerence
in slopes as the statistic you calculate.
Does your stats department have a consultancy service?
This looks like a problem that can be solved easily, if
you sit down with them and spend a few minutes ex-
plaining the problem. Alas Finland is a bit far away.

Software Clann
We wish to introduce Clann, Software for investigating
phylogenomic information using supertrees. The word
“Clann” is the Irish word for “family”.
This version of Clann (2.0.1) implements four supertree
methods (which are used as optimality criteria):
Matrix Representation using Parsimony (But Paup* is
necessary for the parsimony part) Maximum Quartet
ﬁt Maximum Split (component) ﬁt Most Similar Su-
pertree Method (A novel method related to the average
consensus method with branch lengths set to unity)
For each of these optimality criteria, Clann allows:
Searches of supertree-space using Exhaustive or Heuris-
tic searches (NNI & SPR) Searches of User-deﬁned
trees. Investigation into the support for various hy-
potheses through: Bootstrapping (at the source tree
level) YAPTP tests (a randomisation test similar to
the ptp test)
Clann is freely available to the scientiﬁc community at:

Software SCANMS
Dear Colleagues,
SCANMS is a utility that, when used together with
Richard Hudson’s coalescent simulator MS, allows you
to make parametric bootstraps of a sliding window
analysis of various neutrality test statistics.
Currently supported statistics are Tajima’s D, and Fu
and Li’s D* and F*. The joint distributions of win-
dow minima and maxima that SCANMS outputs may
be used to correct for multiple comparisons in sliding
window analyses of these statistics.
SCANMS is available for download from http://-
www.lcb.uu.se/˜dave/SCANMS SCANMS, being quite
simple, should work on any platform to which Perl has
been ported. This list includes Windows, Mac Classic
and Mac OS X (where it should Just Work). But it
has only been tested on Linux and Mac OS X. If you
have feedback about the use or installation of SCANMS
please contact me.
From the website you can also get a preprint of a short
application note to appear in Bioinformatics. This
manuscript brieﬂy discusses the eﬀect of recombination
on the joint distribution of window extrema of Tajima’s
D.
SCANMS is open source software and may be freely
modiﬁed and re-distributed under the terms of the Aca-
demic Free License, v. 2.

Hello,
So many responses to my query about saving tree im-
ages to drawing programs (see below)! Lots of people
asked for the responses, so I’ve collected a sample of the
sugestions below. Basically, it seems like everything is
easier on a Mac. My problem (on a PC) seems to have
been that the .emf ﬁgures are so large when they are
opened in Illustrator that I didn’t see any of the tree un-
til I had Zoomed out and Scaled the tree down. None
of the cut-and-paste suggestions have worked for me.
Thanks to everyone.
Initial query: Does anyone know how to take tree ﬁles
from PAUP, MrBayes, or TreeView and import them
into Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop so that they can
be manipulated and eventually inserted into a Word ﬁle
for publication? TreeView only allows you to save ﬁles
as .emf or .wmf and Adobe doesn’t recognize those ﬁles.
Responses: >Actually, Adobe Illustrator 10 (Windows)
WILL directly open either .emf or .wmf ﬁles saved by54 EvolDir March 1, 2004
TreeView. I don’t know why you have been having trou-
ble with that. I just re-veriﬁed that I can double-click,
at the directory display level in Windows, on a .wmf
from TreeView and Adobe Ill. 10 comes right up with
that ﬁle in hand and is ready to edit it. What seems to
be trickier is ﬁnding the right format in which to EX-
PORT them, after alterations, so that the Microsoft
oﬃce suite can deal with them. I have had the best
luck by far saving them as bitmap ﬁles, .bmp. Then ei-
ther PowerPoint or Word will take them up in at least
somewhat manipulable form, with everything intact.
Good luck with it...

>The easiest way (at least for me) to manipulate trees
made in PAUP and MrBayes (which uses PAUP to
crunch the data it generates into a tree) is to do the
following. Construct the tree by whatever method you
like. Under “Trees” along the top of the screen, choose
the “Print Trees” option. A dialog box will pop up
with options for printing the tree. Choose “Preview”.
This will give you an idea of what the ﬁnal tree will
look like. Go back one step if you want to change the
look of the tree (for example, from a slanted cladogram
to a phylogram). Once you are happy with the tree,
choose “Preview” again. On the left side of the screen,
there will be an option to save the resulting tree as a
PICT ﬁle. Save it to where you like under whatever
name you like. Open this ﬁle in the graphics program
you like and you should be able to manipulate the ﬁle,
such as thicken the branches and change the font of the
names. Sometimes you will have to ungroup the ele-
ments of the tree, so select the whole ﬁgure and check
the status of the grouping. If it is one unit, deselect
to the individual elements. I’ve had great success with
this method using the programs CorelDraw, FreeHand
and Canvas to produce publication-grade trees for a va-
riety of journals (make sure to save the manipulated ﬁle
in TIFF format at 300 dpi or higher since this is what
most journals like/want).
Hope this helps.Cheers,
Scott

ysis Made Easy, has some great suggestions for data
pipelines and ﬁle manipulation like this.

>I am myself unhappy about these same things. I used
to copy the trees from treeﬁle either by control C or

to convert the inserted object into a windows drawing
object. Agree, and it will recognize text and lines as
such, but it will lose some of the exact line positions,
so the tree does not look absolutely perfect any longer
(can be edited by hand, but this is a horrible lot of
work and depends on your printer in the end, i.e., it
might not look in print exactly as on the screen). I
would therefore be happy to learn how others are doing
it. There must be an easier trick. Please let me know

Hi,
It depends how you want to deﬁne diversity, and what
your data looks like.
If you can score genotypes: i.e. you can tell that the dif-
ference between individuals carrying alleles (a,a,b) and
individuals carrying (a,b,b) then you should try looking
at
Hardy OJ, Vekemans X (2002) SPAGEDi: a versatile
computer program to analyse spatial genetic structure
at the individual or population levels. Molecular Ecol-
ogy Notes 2, 618-620.
Which correctly handles polyploids (at least, 2n-ploids
- I’m not so up on triploids. Are they sexual?)
Also have a look at
Thrall PH, Young A (2000) AUTOTET: A program for
analysis of autotetraploid genotypic data. Journal of
Heredity 91, 348-349. Which may give you some ideas.
If you cannot score genotypes, i.e. you can see whichalleles each individual is carrying, but not the dosage:
a,a,b = a,b,b - >“a,b”
Then things are less straight-forward. You can use the
gel/banding phenotypes to measure diversity.
I have written a program (I’m writing the paper
at the moment) that calculates the commonly used
phenotype-diversity stats. If you are interested, email
me and I can send you a copy plus my reference list.
Its designed for sexual 2n allopolyploids, but I see no
reason why the stats couldn’t be used for a triploid
(asexual or otherwise).
Please let me know if you ﬁnd any other software that
people use for triploids - I would be interested to know
about it.

http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/lagev/ Hi Maurine, I
saw your question on EvolDir, I have been struggling
with this myself as well. Almost all programs that
are available are only able to deal with diploids. To
overcome this, I wrote some programs myself, to do
stuﬀ like this. They might to some extent be what
you are looking for. One is a program that reads ge-
netic data (of any ploidy) and helps you in determining
which individuals have the same genotype, with respect
to errors/missing data/mutations. The other program
reads the genotype data and can output diversity in-
dices (including eveness, I wonder what you mean by
richness, btw), and test through permutation for diﬀer-
ences in the genotypic composition of populations and
also tests through bootstrapping whether populations
diﬀer in genotypic diversity (which I guess is of pri-
mary importance for you). You can ﬁnd the programs
onhttp://www.science.uva.nl/ ˜ meirmans . For other
tests on polyploids I recommend the program Spagedi
by Olivier Hardy and Xavier Vekemans.
Good luck with the analysis.

Category: Postdocs
Position announcement: TuftsU MolEvolInfDisease
Applications are invited for postdoctoral fellow(s) to62 EvolDir March 1, 2004
study molecular evolution of certain agents of infec-
tious disease and their hosts. Work in the lab centers
upon two NIH-funded projects involving two distinct
pathogen-host systems. The ﬁrst is aimed at elucidat-
ing the population structure of Plasmodium falciparum
in malaria endemic regions in the world?s tropics. The
second involves study of the ecological interaction of
hosts, vectors, and pathogens of Lyme borreliosis, with
particular focus on those aspects of the interactions
which are mediated by genomic factors. Candidates
seeking to work on either of these projects should have
strong skills in molecular biology and ﬂuency with the
theoretical aspects of evolutionary analyses. A back-
ground in parasitology, entomology and/or microbiol-
ogy is highly favorable. The incumbent(s) would join a
unique research group within the Division of Infectious
Diseases (DID) at the Tufts University Vet School. The
campus is located in a rural setting approximately 30
miles west of Boston. Salary for these position(s) are
highly competitive and based on experience. Interested
parties should send C.V., two reprints, and list of three

UAngers SexualSelection
Mating strategies and sexual selection in European
newts
There is an opportunity of a 12-month post-doctoral
position (EU 6th Framework) in the laboratory of an-
imal ecology in Angers (France). The main research
topic of the laboratory is evolutionary ecology and
behavioural ecology of vertebrates in hydrosystems.
Urodeles can display an unusual mating system where
females may accept several males and males may sire
oﬀsprings of several females during the breeding pe-
riod. Additionally, in the genus Triturus males seem
unable to force female choice. In such a system, fe-
males could display a large ﬂexibility in their mating
strategies, ranging from monandry to promiscuity, de-
pending on environmental conditions and the quality of
mating partners. However, little is known about mating
strategies in urodeles. The project aims at investigating
the behavioural bases of sexual selection in newts and
how this may condition the development of alternate
mating strategies. The applicant is to address these is-sues using laboratory experiments and empirical ﬁeld
data. Experience in designing mate choice experiments
and molecular techniques of paternity assignement are
most required. Modelling skills in the evolution of mat-
ing systems would also be appreciated. The funding of
the project is partly conditional to the quality of the
applicant. The deadline for candidate application is
February 14th 2004. The position starts in September
2004 and is applicable to all EU members but French.
The applicant should not have been living in France
for the last 3 years. Please send a CV and a list of
publications by e-mail only.

MOLECULAR BASIS OF MIMICRY POSTDOC PO-
SITION IN EDINBURGH
A three year BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position is
available at the University of Edinburgh to study the
genetic basis of mimicry in Heliconius melpomene.
Heliconius erato and H. melpomene have evolved over
20 distinct geographic races that are convergent be-
tween the species due to mimicry, oﬀering an excellent
opportunity to study the genetic basis of phenotypic
adaptation. This project aims to identify genomic re-
gions controlling the radiation of H. melpomene using
linkage mapping. The project will develop ESTs from
wing tissue sampled at diﬀerent stages in development.
Genes likely to be involved in wing pattern and pigment
formation or identiﬁed as being diﬀerentially expressed
between diﬀerent pigment types, will be included in the
map, and linkage to the loci controlling mimicry phe-
notypes established. Homologous linkage groups will
be identiﬁed in the mimetic species, Heliconius erato,
to determine whether the same genomic regions are
used to produce convergent colour patterns in mimetic64 EvolDir March 1, 2004

POSTDOCTORATE or Ph.D. POSITION IN
SALMONID EVOLUTIONARY FUNCTIONAL
GENOMICS
We are currently looking for either a postdoctorate
or Ph.D. candidate to be involved in our ongoing re-
search project regarding the elucidation of functional
genomic bases of growth and anadromy in salmonid
ﬁshes. This multidisciplinary project is funded by
FQRNT (Quebes) and NSERC (Canada) and is also
part of the research program of the Canadian Research
Chair in conservation genetics of aquatic organisms.
The originality and interest of this project is based
upon a multidisciplinary approach integrating ge-
nomics, physiology and immunology. The use of charr
species (Salvelinus) as a model system oﬀers partic-
ular interest for investigating the functional genomic
bases of growth and anadromy. Namely, some of these
species are well diﬀerentiated in terms of growth po-
tential and physiological adaptations to seawater. Yet,
such species can interbreed in laboratory and natural
conditions, which oﬀers a unique oportunity to investi-
gate the basis of heterosis and outbreeding depression
at the functional genomics level.
The speciﬁc objective of the proposed research will be
to apply microarray technology for quantifying gene
expression proﬁles in pure brook and arctic charr, as
well as in their hybrid crosses in order to determine
and compare the nature and number of genes poten-
tially involved in diﬀerential growth in both freshwater
and saltwater. A 16000 gene microarray recently devel-
opped in salmonids is already available to achieve this
work.
We are primarily looking for a candidate with strong
laboratory expertise in functional genomics, a solid the-
oretical background in evolutionary biology, quantita-
tive genetics or comparative physiology, as well as ex-
pertise in management and analysis of large data bases.
The position is available now.
To apply, please send a cover letter describing your re-
search interests, a complete CV and names of three

Post-doc in Conservation Genetics in Uppsala
We seek a competitive post-doc who will join a group
working with carnivore conservation genetics (mainly
wolves and wolverines). Although partly conducted on
a global scale, a main line of research centers on the
situation on the Scandinavian peninsula, for which ex-
tensive information about demographic trends is avail-
able for these species. To obtain a better understanding
on the history of the populations we are combining the
use of diverse molecular markers, including maternally
inherited mitochondrial DNA sequences and paternal
Y chromosome haplotypes. We are also studying bi-
parental autosomal markers: microsatellites, single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and MHC sequences.
Key questions include inbreeding, immigration and hy-
bridization. The successful candidate will work mainly
with the development of new molecular approaches for
the study of conservation genetics.
A selected list of recent publications to indicate on-
going activities is given below. For further in-
formation please visit http://www.ebc.uu.se/evbiol/-
Research/Conservation.html The laboratory is situ-
ated in the recently-built Evolutionary Biology Centre
of Uppsala University and is equipped with large-scale
sequence and genotype facilities including 96-capillary
DNA sequencing, pyrosequencing, DHPLC and real-
time PCR. The working atmosphere is international
with a regular recruitment of post-docs. The Centre is
an exciting arena for multi-disciplinary research in evo-
lutionary biology, housing some 400 scientists and grad-
uate students, with research programs in ecology, sys-
tematics, genetics, genomics, functional genomics and
developmental biology. Uppsala University is the old-
est in Scandinavia and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant
student town with beautiful surroundings conveniently
situated close to Stockholm.
Informal inquiries and applications should be sent to
the address indicated below. Previous experience of
research in conservation genetics of merit. A strong
background in molecular genetics is required. Please
include with the application a full CV, a statement of
research interests and the name and address of at least
two referees. The position is initially for two years, with
possibilities for prolongation after this period.

Dates: April 12-16th 2004 inclusive. Registrationdeadline: March 15th, 2004. Website: http://-
bioinf.may.ie/Phylogenomics/ Background
Phylogenomics and phyloinformatics are two terms that
relate to the processing of large amounts of genomic
data with a view towards producing organismal phylo-
genies based upon those data. The two main methods
of analysis include supermatrix and supertree analysis.
We have no particular preference for either approach
and will present both kinds of solution along with cau-
tionary tales about each.
Who is this course for?72 EvolDir March 1, 2004
This course is designed to be of the most beneﬁt to
those researchers that have a small amount of familiar-
ity with phylogenetic analysis and intend on setting up
and using a system for performing phylogenetic analy-
sis on the genome level. The level at which the course
is being taught is introductory to intermediate. This is
NOT an advanced level course. If there is demand for
such a course, it could be organised in the future.
Students are encouraged to bring their own data.

RiodeJaneiro Complexity Nov 2
Workshop on Complexity and Philosophy Co-hosted
by:Federal university of Rio de JaneiroInstitute for
the Study of Coherence and EmergenceCathedra for
the Study of Complexity (Instituto de Filosoﬁa de
La Habana) Calling Notice November 2004, Rio de
Janeiro(exact dates to be determined shortly) Call
for Participants I am writing to you today to in-
form you about the upcoming two-day Complexity
and Philosophy workshop to be held this November
(2004) in Rio de Janeiro and hosted by the Institute
for the Study of Coherence and Emergence( http://-
www.isce.edu ), U.F.R.J. (Federal university of Rio de
Janeiro), and the Cathedra for the Study of Complex-
ity (Instituto de Filosoﬁa de La Habana) . The aim of
this meeting is to explore the philosophical implications
of the ﬂedgling science of complex systems. This work-
shop complements the 2nd Biennial International Semi-
nar on the Philosophical, Epistemological and Method-
ological Iimplications of Complexity Theory that was
held in Havana, Cuba, January 2004. The larger inter-
national seminar provides a forum to discuss complex-
ity and philosophy-related issues in general, whereas
the aim of the smaller workshop event is to consider
speciﬁc issues at a greater length with more time made
available for discussion rather than presentation. The
location for the workshop event is expected to change
location each time it is held. In 2002 the event was
held in Norwood (just outside Boston) in the US. This
time we are pleased to announce that the next event
will be held in Rio de Janeiro, with the very generous
assistance of the Federal university of Rio de Janeiro.
Call for Papers Potential attendees are encouraged to
submit papers on the following topics: Status, limits
and legitimacy of knowledge regarding complex systems
Relationship between linear and nonlinear philosophies
Complexity-based ethics Frameworks for the analysis
of complex systems Complex limits to ‘theories of ev-
erything’ Complexity and the social sciences Complex-
ity and globalization Complexity and human subjectiv-
ity All paper submissions will be considered for publi-
cation in the international journal Emergence: Com-
plexity and Organization (depending upon suitability),
and/or publication in an edited book of papers to be
published by IAP Press as part of ISCE’s Managing
the Complex Book Series. Selected papers from the74 EvolDir March 1, 2004
previous event have appeared in Nonlinear Dynamics,
Psychology and the Life Sciences, and this journal may
again prove to be a publishing avenue for selected pa-
pers. All papers will be considered for publication even
if time cannot be found for the papers to be presented
at the conference itself (the emergent properties of such
an event and the organiser’s hope to focus on discus-
sion/dialogue rather than a standard presentation for-
mat may at times dictate the proceedings). Provisional
Timetable Please let Caroline Richardson (complexity-
workshop@isce.edu) know of your interest in attending
this event as soon as possible. Attendance at the event
will be strictly limited to 30 so as to encourage genuine
dialogue amongst participants - selection of attendees
will be determined simply on a ﬁrst come ﬁrst serve ba-
sis. A block of 30 rooms will be reserved for the event
and a reduced room rate (that includes breakfast) will
be negotiated. Final details concerning hotel rates will
be made available in the next month or so. Extended
abstracts of at least 1000 words to be submitted to Dr.
Kurt Richardson (kurt@kurtrichardson.com) by end of
July, 2004. The decision by the academic board (which
will comprise members of I.S.C.E.’s fellowship) to en-
courage submission of a full paper - to be no longer
than 5000 words - will occur by end of August, 2004.
Full papers to be submitted by end of October, 2004.
The decision as to what papers will be published and
in what form will occur shortly after the closing of the
conference. It is hoped that participants will play an
integral role in the development of the event timetable
before and during the event. The exact cost of registra-
tion will be determined shortly, but fees are expected
to be around US$300. As well as administrative and lo-
cation costs, fees will also cover lunch during the event
as well as a Brazilian-style dinner event at the close
of the second day. Participants will be responsible for
their own hotel costs. If you would like to attend the
workshop please send an email to Caroline Richardson
(complexityworkshop@isce.edu) with the following in-
formation: Name, academic aﬃliation and status if any,
address, phone, fax, and email. Caroline will contact
you for further information re hotel conﬁrmation and
payment of workshop fees. If you have any questions at
all please do not hesitate to contact Kurt or Caroline

Valencia AsexualOrigins Apr16-18
Second Announcement
Workshop “Origin and Spread of Asexuals” (16-18
April 2004; Valencia, Spain)
PARTNER-European Science Foundation
Presentation
The workshop “Origin and Spread of Asexuals” will
be held 16-18 April 2004 in Valencia (Spain). The
workshop is organized in the frame of PARThenogen-
esis NetwoRk (PARTNER; http://www.nioo.knaw.nl/-
NETWORKS/PARTNER ), a network funded by the
European Science Foundation. The workshop is or-
ganized by Manuel Serra (University of Valencia) and
Claudia Ricci (University of Milan). We address to
young scientists starting an independent research ca-
reer, post-docs and advanced graduate students for
inviting them to attend the workshop. The workshop is
aimed to study the origin of asexual reproduction from
sexual ancestors and their maintenance and spread.
The focus is on how molecular mechanisms, reproduc-76 EvolDir March 1, 2004
tive cytological mechanisms, life-history traits and pop-
ulation features may aﬀect the origin and maintenance
of asexuality. The workshop will stress the link be-
tween proximate and evolutionary causes of asexuality,
using a comparative approach. As a related topic, the
origin, advantages and maintenance of partial asexu-
ality (e.g., cyclical parthenogenesis) will be addressed.
The following topics will be considered: (1) Becoming
asexual; (2) Cytological mechanisms to produce asex-
ual eggs and seeds; (3) Avoiding genomic problems and
evolving in the absence of sex (mutational load, capac-
ity of asexuals to adapt to environmental novelties); (4)
Partial asexuality: advantage and instability; (5) The
fate of asexual taxa: dynamics aspects. The workshop
will consist of 14 talks given by senior scientists (see
below), followed by discussion sessions.
Site and schedule
The workshop site will be the residence of the Univer-
sity of Valencia “Colegio Mayor Rector Peset” ( http://-
www.uv.es/cmrpeset/ ), located at Valencia downtown.
Meals will be served in the workshop site. Accommo-
dation will be provided also in the workshop site and
in hostels at walking distance. The meeting will start
on Friday, April 16, with a welcome lunch. Workshop
sessions will run from the 15:00 h of Friday, April 16,
to the 13:00 of Sunday, April 18. After the last session,
the meeting will end with a farewell lunch.
Applications
Applications should include a short CV and a brief de-
scription of his/her current research topic (less than 400
words). The selection will be performed on the base of
research record and topic, and the scope of the Euro-
pean network. The workshop organization will cover
the accommodation costs in the facilities provided by
the organization for the invited attendants, but cannot
cover their travel expenses. Applications, preferably
through e-mail, should be submitted before February
15, 2004, to

Workshop on Molecular Evolution
http://workshop.molecularevolution.org/ Michael P.
Cummings, Director
25 July - 6 August 2004 plus extended special topics
session 6 August - 13 August 2003
Application Deadline 1 March 2004
The Workshop on Molecular Evolution has been the
ﬁnest course of its type in the world since it was started
in 1988. The Workshop consists of a series of lectures,
demonstrations and computer laboratories that cover
various aspects of molecular evolution. A distinguish-
ing feature of the Workshop is a well-equipped com-
puter laboratory with Linux workstations and servers
for comparative analysis of molecular data. Authors
and experts in the use of computer programs and pack-
ages such as Clustal W and Clustal X, FASTA, GCG,
LAMARC, MrBayes, PAML, PAUP*, and PHYLIP
provide demonstrations and consultations. This two-
week program is designed for established investigators,
postdoctoral fellows, and advanced graduate students
with prior experience in molecular evolution and com-
parative genomics. Scientists with a strong interest in
molecular evolution, systematics, and population ge-
netics are encouraged to apply. Enrollment is limited
to 60 students, and 15 students will be admitted to
an extended topics session for the purpose of analyz-
ing their research data sets. Many participants ﬁnd the
extended topics session to be especially useful.
Topics to be covered include:
* Databases and sequence matching: database search-
ing: protein sequence versus protein structure; homol-
ogy; mathematical, statistical, and theoretical aspects
of sequence database searches * Phylogenetic analysis:
theoretical, mathematical and statistical bases; sam-
pling properties of sequence data; Bayesian analysis,
hypothesis testing * Character analysis in a phylo-
genetic context: analysis of quantitative and discrete
characters; hypothesis testing * Maximum likelihoodMarch 1, 2004 EvolDir 77
theory and practice in phylogenetics and population ge-
netics: coalescent theory; maximum likelihood estima-
tion of population genetic parameters * Bayesian meth-
ods in phylogenetic analysis * Molecular evolution inte-
grated at diﬀerent levels: population biology; biogeog-
raphy; ecology; systematics and conservation * Molec-
ular evolution and development: gene duplication and
divergence; gene family organization; coordinated ex-
pression in evolution * Comparative genomics: genome
content; genome structure; genome evolution * Trans-
posable elements: types; history; evolutionary dynam-
ics; as a major component of genomes

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.

This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
